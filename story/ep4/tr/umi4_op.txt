`"Wahahahaha, you alright, Battler‐kun...?!`
` We're already on the ground, y'know, you can't fall any further than that, wahahahaha...!"`
`"Uu, *giggle*giggle*!`
` Gonna faaall, gonna faaall, *giggle*giggle*!"`
`In the lobby of the Niijima airport, Maria dashed around in excitement.`
`{n}Battler's uproar in the plane must have been very funny to her.`
`"Hey, Maria!`
` That's enough!`
` ...Sorry, Battler‐kun.`
` Don't take it badly."`
`"Man, you're {i:pathetic}.`
` A grown‐ass man like you still can't handle vehicles?"`
`"Urgh, shut up...`
` All humans have one or two things they can't handle..."`
`"Battler‐kun, why don't you come with your aunt on an overseas trip sometime soon?`
` What about Europe?`
` I'm sure you'd conquer your fears after the half‐day plane trip.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"...Stop it, Mother.`
` I'm sure Battler‐kun's dislike for vehicles is inherited."`
`"Oh, from Asumu‐san?"`
`"......For some reason, she just couldn't handle vehicles.`
` Pretty much anything other than a bicycle or a car.`
` Whenever we tried to take a trip somewhere far away, that woman was so annoying with the "no not this, no not that,`
` I'm scared I'm scared, I'm going to fall I'm going to fall, scream scream"."`
`"Children tend to learn that things which their parents can't seem to handle are dangerous.`
` Battler‐kun must have seen Asumu‐san doing something like that and learned that vehicles are scary."`
`"*giggle*giggle*.`
` Could it be Asumu‐san's genes, I wonder?"`
`"Beats me.`
` Those'd be some damned annoying genes.`
` .........Stop talking about Asumu.`
` Right now, the one who's here is you.`
` Right?"`
`"...You're right, sorry."`
`"Heyyy, the cars are here!`
` Exactly three of 'em.`
` All in, all in!"`
`"Gonna fall, gonna faaall!!`
` Where's the parachuuute, where's the parachuuuute!!`
` Uu‐uu, *giggle*!!"`
`"You little rapscallio~n!!`
` Wait, wait, come back here, you!`
` I'll sentence you to the tickle punishme~nt!!"`
`"Ehheheheheh.`
` It's good that they're in high spirits.`
` If Battler‐kun and Maria‐chan weren't there, the atmosphere in that plane would have been very stiff."`
`"Thanks.`
` I'll take that at face value.`
` ......Hey, brats!`
` The taxis are here!`
` Save the games for later."`
`"Uu‐uu!!`
` Taxiii, taxiii!!`
` I'm gonna be first iiiiin!`
` *giggle*!!"`
`"Hey!`
` Maria, and you too, Battler‐kun, stop fooling around!`
` You'll bump into someone!"`
`The tone of Auntie Rosa's voice became a little frightening.`
`Battler, too, had started to think that perhaps he really was fooling around too much...when, just as expected, he bumped into someone.`
`"Oh, sorry..."`
`"Battler‐kun, your family is going in the car over there.`
` You're keeping them waiting."`
`Rushed on by George, Battler made an apologetic gesture to the person he had bumped into and ran up to his parents, who were telling him to come quickly.`
`With clunking sounds, the doors on the three taxis were shut one after another, and they departed, heading for the harbor......`
`......As their taxis dashed away...`
`...the entire world grew suddenly dull,`
` ......and slowed to a halt.`
`Voices, the wind, and even sound—`
`absolutely everything ceased, and as if they had been frozen in the instant a photo was taken, everything moving or about to move...`
`...stopped.`
`People, machines, clock hands, even the dust dancing in the wind—frozen.`
`{n}People who were in the middle of walking—frozen, with one foot still raised.`
`{n}Scraps of paper dancing in the wind—frozen, pinned in midair.`
`......And among these stationary figures in this world that had come to a standstill, a single one...moved.`
`It was a woman.`
` The very woman that Battler had just bumped into...`
`It was truly the slightest of movements.`
`Her gaze dropped, her shoulders lowered a minuscule amount, and she sighed.`
`{n}...That was all.`
`In a normal world, that probably wouldn't even count as movement,`
` but in this still world, it looked very out of place.`
`...Then something else moved.`
`{n}It was a black cat that had been dozing in the shadows near the taxi rank.`
`It came up right behind the woman,`
` ......and leisurely...changed its form into that of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
`It wasn't a cat.`
` It was a witch.`
`{n}Of course, the woman was also a witch.`
`As the witch stood there, her gaze still downwards, she muttered...`
`".........I can't stop them...`
`...from going to Rokkenjima, can I..."`
`"You cannot.`
` On October 4th, 1986, you are not here."`
`"......So if I had been here, it might even have been possible to stop them all from going...?"`
`"What verbal acrobatics a six‐year‐old girl could possibly perform to persuade them to turn back,`
` I can't even imagine.`
` ......But yes.`
` If you had been in this place, the probability wouldn't have been zero.`
` If there is a probability other than zero, I can find a miracle."`
`"......If I hadn't been sick,`
` ...and they hadn't left me behind......"`
`With her head facing downwards, the witch tightened her fists...`
`{n}...They were trembling very slightly.`
`"You were sick in bed starting October 3rd, 1986.`
` And Beato's game board is a snippet of time beginning on October 4th.`
` ......You are not given the possibility of not getting sick.`
` ...In other words, you are fundamentally an existence which can never step up onto the game board."`
`"Thanks for being so patronizing.`
` ......I'm aware of that.`
` ......I know that just seeing Mom, Dad,`
` .........and Onii‐chan healthy and happy like this,`
` ......that alone...`
`...is a very wonderful miracle...`
` .........I know that all too well..."`
`Ange had been trying to stand in the way of her family, and prevent them from going outside the airport, ......towards Rokkenjima.`
`...But that was impossible for Ange, who could not exist there on October 4th, 1986.`
`Just receiving a shoulder‐bump and words of apology from her older brother...`
`...Even though he hadn't known that she was his sister,`
` ...that was still such a miracle,`
` ......it could have moved her to tears......`
`"............I'm sorry for the sarcasm.`
` I won't waste the miracle you've given me."`
`"I'm glad to hear it.`
` ......Now, let's go with them.`
` To Rokkenjima.`
` Soon, all of the pieces will be gathered.`
` ......The curtain will open on the fourth game.`
` Beato and Battler will already be seated by now."`
`"......To Rokkenjima......`
` ............To the day my...`
`no,`
` ......the day {i:everyone's} fates changed...October 4th, 1986,`
` ...on Rokkenjima........."`
`...What happened on that day?`
`{n}I will expose that.`
` Learn that.`
` And I'll take them back...!`
`As she stood there with her fists still clenched, she surely turned her face to the heavens.`
`{n}A single teardrop from the depths of her eyes dripped down into the air.`
`And when time started moving again, the two witches' figures were sucked into a blowing gale, and erased in an instant.`
