`"Heyyyy!!`
` That's miiine!`
` Give—it—back!!"`
`"Nonono, I'm gonna eat i~t!`
` Asmo, Asmo, pass!"`
`"Kyaahahahaha!`
` Levia onee‐sama, over here, over here~!"`
`I wonder where they swiped it from.`
`{n}They were fighting over a donut or something, playing around really loudly.`
`"HEY!!!!!`
` Ange‐sama is reading, can't you be the slightest bit quiet?!"`
`"And yet you're the loudest one, Satan, silence yourself!!`
` You cretinous sister!"`
`"Y‐you're louder than me, Lucifer onee‐sama!!`
` I‐is there something you want to say to me?!"`
`By now, I was used to the fights between the eldest and the third‐eldest sister.`
` It's a bit funny how they're both a little hesitant even though they're so quick to anger.`
`They might be surprisingly similar.`
`"Heh heh.`
` You ordered us to be noisy, but this is surely too much.`
` Should I make them lower the volume a little?"`
`"............You can all mess around all you want.`
` It's a hundred times more pleasant than the shrill laughter in the classroom."`
`"Ange‐samaa, hurry up, next paaage!`
` You read really slooww!"`
`"You like to read, Mammon?`
` You look like you'd be the most averse to such ordinary things."`
`"Mammon's domain is greed.`
` ......That also includes a thirst for knowledge.`
` But she tends to want to keep that knowledge all for herself, so when someone gives her a book, she'll sometimes burn it after reading it so that no one else can—please watch out for that."`
`"I like knowing things that no one else knows.`
` I like being able to do things that no one else can do.`
` So I like studying and practicing.`
` Because I want to keep wisdom that no one else knows about all to myself."`
`As Mammon said that, her eyes sparkling,`
` she stared transfixed at the open page, reading through it again.`
`You could see the greed that made her even more intent than me on devouring that page.`
`As you can see, my magical power was now much stronger compared to the first day I summoned them.`
`I was now at the point where I could summon all of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory at once and still calmly read a book like this.`
`This place, although I couldn't recall {i:where} it was, was a quiet and calm street‐side bench.`
`The reason that I couldn't remember the location of this place was that at the time I visited it, I was very young.`
`......Still, I remembered the day we'd walked here, and how much fun it was.`
`Mom, Dad, ...and even Onii‐chan had been there—`
`it was a memory of a very rare and very happy day when all the family had actually been together...`
`The people walking by every once in a while weren't noticing me.`
`{n}They were just pleasantly ignoring me and passing by as normal.`
`I wasn't even the slightest bit embarrassed by the Seven Sisters' shameless outfits,`
` because it wasn't like they were actually being seen by anyone.`
`In fact, I'd gotten pretty used to them.`
` Just so long as they didn't make {i:me} wear one.`
`I was sitting on a stylish bench, memorizing a timeline for world history.`
`......In an academy system where everything is based on collective responsibility, there's no tolerance for dunces.`
`It seemed that I was lowering the average grade for the class considerably.`
`According to those extremely intellectual girls,`
` if I alone improved my grade, the average would rise drastically.`
`......They had been kind enough to show me with a graph drawn with colorful pens on a B4 sheet of drawing paper.`
`...Just thinking of the effort it must have taken to draw that was nauseating.`
`But I'd already spat out all of those complaints.`
` ......I'd already used those girls to vent all my furious anger and sadness.`
`The Seven Sisters...`
`were sometimes outraged,`
` sometimes compassionate,`
` and sometimes shared in my sorrows.`
`......I was truly happy to have friends with whom I could share those emotions.`
`It's said that they were originally furniture that existed to carry out {f:5:Beatrice}'s cruel sacrificial ritual.`
`......If that sickening occult message bottle was to be believed,`
` ...it seemed that several among them even attacked my family.`
`But I didn't believe that, and it would be pointless to question them about it.`
`They're furniture, so all they do is respond to their master's requests.`
`Even if they really had attacked my family, I couldn't hate them.`
`......The one I really hated...`
`...was the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}.........Or else the one at the very center of Rokkenjimagate,`
` Aunt Eva.`
`"......Ange‐sama, hurry up, next page."`
`"Oh, sorry.`
` .........I'm tired.`
` Mind if I take a break?"`
`"Kyahaha!`
` Ange‐sama says she's having a break!"`
`"Let's play, let's play!`
` Ange‐sama, let's plaaaay!!"`
`When they noticed that I had interrupted my studying, the most energetic youngest sisters gathered around me.`
`That wasn't all.`
`Even Maria onee‐chan and Sakutaro showed themselves.`
`They had probably been very close by, but they must have hid themselves so that they didn't interrupt my studying.`
`‘Uryuu!`
` Ange~!`
` How's studying? How's studying?’`
`"Kyaaah!!`
` Sakutaroo!!`
` How are yooooouu?!"`
`"Wait a second!`
` Let me fluffle him tooooooooooo!!"`
`"You snooze you lose, aren't we always telling you?!`
` Kyaa, so cute, so cute!"`
`‘Ukyuuu, you're crushing meee!`
` Uryuuu!’`
`"Your luck ran out when you showed up when all of the Seven Sisters were gathered.`
` Now accept your fate and be fluffled."`
`"Come on!`
` Do you always have to treat him like this?!`
` I apologize on behalf of my stupid sisters...!"`
`"Ahahahahaha.`
` Sakutaro's happy to meet all of you too.`
` ......Well, Ange?`
` How's your studying?"`
`"Thanks.`
` Well, not bad."`
`"They were nice enough to pass me a printout of the test from another class who took it earlier.`
` Their beautiful sense of solidarity is enough to bring tears to my eyes.`
` ......Well, at least I'll do a little better now for putting the timeline into my head."`
`‘Uryu.`
` You sure are good at studying, Ange.`
` You'll be able to get a lot of points, uryu~~.’`
`"Good work.`
` I was completely useless at studying, so I'm jealous of you for being able to get a good score when you study hard."`
`"You're joking.`
` English, Latin, knowledge of the occult—`
`you're much more amazing for being able to learn all of that by heart."`
`"I can remember anything when studying magic, but can't remember anything boring I have to study.`
` So it doesn't help at all for tests."`
`"Well, I'm sure your occult knowledge would have been a bit like that, but your English and such must have translated into good grades, right?"`
`"In the first year of elementary school, on a Japanese language test,`
` there was a question where I was given a picture of a gun and four squares, and it said to write its name in the four squares.`
` Wrote "rifle"—{ruby:ra‐i‐fu‐ru:{p:0:ライフル}}—and got it marked wrong."`
`"Why?`
` It fits."`
`"It was supposed to be {ruby:te‐p‐po‐u:{p:0:てっぽう}}, the Japanese word for gun.`
` Got told that it was wrong 'cause you don't learn katakana in first grade."`
`"......I didn't really get it,`
` so from that day on, on tests, I wrote everything in hiragana.`
` But got in trouble with Mama for some reason.`
` Got in trouble with the teachers too."`
`".....................`
` ...You probably picked the wrong country to be born in, Onee‐chan."`
`"Then I'd have liked to have been born in a country of witches and go to a school of witchcraft.`
` Uu."`
`‘And then you might have had a whole lot of even more wonderful magic friends!`
` Uryuu!’`
`"Uu{p:0:♪}`
` But it's not like I mind it now.`
` After all, I can use a lot of magic, and I have a lot of magic friends, too.`
` All I need is Sakutaro."`
`‘I'm not the only one!`
` There's also Sakusuke and Sakukichi, the animal band, Shimoda‐kun the seal, Sanae‐san the rabbit, Piguo‐kun the pig, and plenty more!’`
`......Incredible.`
` Onee‐chan's friends just keep increasing in number.`
`Every time I ask, the list of her friends' names grows longer.`
`{n}But there's no doubt that Sakutaro is her best friend.`
`...I'm a little jealous of her for having such a close friend.`
`"......How are they?`
` The Seven Sisters.`
` Are you getting along with them?"`
`"Those sisters are really energetic.`
` ......They sometimes say worrying stuff, but they aren't bad.`
` ...What I really wanted was to get a cute kid like Sakutaro, but now, I think being with these girls is more than enough."`
`"*giggle*.`
` If you learned my Magic of Origins more, I'm sure you'd be able to create just the kind of friend you'd like, Ange.`
` As it is, creation is still a little too hard for you."`
`"There's a difference between creation and summoning.`
` ......And...resurrection is different still."`
`"...............`
` So your greatest wish really is to revive your family...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ............I have a vessel for it.`
` This."`
`"Yes.`
` ...I'm sure that hair accessory will become the key to summoning Battler someday.`
` ......The rest is up to your training, Ange."`
`"Although not knowing how long that's going to take makes me cry."`
`‘Uryu...`
` Stay strong, even if it's tough...`
` If you don't give up, it will definitely definitely happen someday...’`
`"I'm sure I'd feel a lot more at ease if someone would just give me some proof of that."`
`‘Uryu!`
` Then I'll guarantee it!`
` No doubt about it, someday, you'll be able to make your wish come true!’`
`"......Thanks.`
` I'm happy even for consolation."`
`‘It's not consolation...uryuu.’`
`"Stop it, Ange.`
` That kind of emotion will become the anti‐magic toxin.`
` The feeling that your dreams will definitely come true is the best seed that buds into magic power."`
`"............`
` ......You're right, sorry, Master."`
`"You need to be a bit greedier, Ange‐sama.`
` Go however far for the thing that you desire!`
` Never give up until you get it! That's the willpower you're lacking!"`
`‘Uryuu!`
` That isn't true, Ange is doing her best...!’`
`"Thanks, Sakutaro, Mammon.`
` Crying about it won't help anything.`
` There's nothing I can do except hang in there.`
` I'll try hard.`
` Grit my teeth.`
` And I'll definitely make my dreams come true.`
` For certain."`
`‘Uryu!`
` You're awesome, Ange, do your best!`
` Mammon and I will support youuu!’`
`"Yes, we will.`
` The greedier our master is, the more our worth will increase."`
`"More importantly, Ange‐samaa!`
` We have ten whole people here, sooo..."`
`"We were thinking, maybe we could all play {c:86EF9C:shiritori} together or something!"`
`"Penalty if you lose!`
` Let me nibble your ea~rs!"`
`"Come {i:on}, is there anything inside your head other than food?!"`
`"Please forgive my cretinous sisters' imbecilic proposals...`
` Is it really alright for you not to return to your studying about now?"`
`"No, no, nooooooo!!`
` I waited so long for you to finish studying, you gotta play with us, you gottaaaa!"`
`"I don't think it's a bad idea.`
` I would suggest that playing every once in a while is a good way of exercising the mind."`
`"............Your domain was sloth, right, Belphe?`
` What you're saying sounds reasonable, but you're actually being sneaky, aren't you?"`
`"Heh.`
` My apologies.`
` ......You are a diligent one, Ange‐sama."`
`"If it's okay with you, Ange, I'd like to play with everyone, too.`
` All noisy together.`
` It'll definitely be fun."`
`‘Uryuu!`
` Ange, Ange, let's play, let's play!`
` Let's all do shiritori!’`
`"In that case, let's start from Sakutaro's "uryu".`
` .........What does the next word have to start with in this case?`
` "Ryu"?`
` "Yu"?"`
`"If it's "uryu"?`
` ...............I wonder.`
` Maybe it really would be "ryu"?"`
`"......It's rare for a word that ends weirdly like that to come up."`
`"Okay, I'm first then!!`
` I'll start from "ryu"!`
` A {ruby:ryuuzu:"watch ste~m"}!"`
`"I wanted to be the one to speak first!`
` {ruby:ryuuto:"Lute"} would have been so much more wonderful!"`
`"‘Zu’?`
` Feels like we keep getting tough ones.`
` ...Wait a sec, what order are we going in?`
` Who's next?"`
`‘Uryu.`
` I don't think it matters who.`
` Whoever thinks of something first.’`
`"Huh, that sounds fun.`
` The person who can say the most wins?`
` It's fast‐talking shiritori!"`
`"OK, I'll go, then!`
` "Zucchini"!`
` {ruby:ninniku itame:"Garlic stir‐fry"}!`
` "Mekabu and pasta"~!`
` All of them delicious!`
` Kyaha, I said three!"`
`"Belzie takes three points.`
` ......Can you use conjunctions?"`
`"If you could use "and" then anything would work!!`
` That last one doesn't count!`
` Minus one point!!`
` Start over at "me"."`
`"Okay, my turn.`
` {ruby:merenge:"Meringue"~!"}`
`‘‘Ge’??`
` ...U...u...`
`...uryuu!’`
`"{ruby:gesuidou:‘Drainage system’},`
` {ruby:umetatechi:"reclaimed land"},`
` {ruby:chikashitsu:"basement"}.`
` Something like that?"`
`"Onee‐sama, those are all pretty unrefined words, *giggle*!"`
`"S‐so what, why don't you try following up with something refined, then!!`
` Anyway, that's three points for me.`
` The next one's "tsu", alright, "tsu"!"`
`"Never played such a weird shiritori before.`
` Uu‐uu!`
` Fun!"`
`‘Uryuu!`
` I don't get it at all, but it's fun.`
` Uryuu!’`
`I'd played normal shiritori before, but this kind of weird shiritori was a new experience for me.`
`The Seven Sisters, who would be lively enough just on their own; Maria onee‐chan; Sakutaro; and me.`
`I was now surrounded by friends that were just so fun.`
`......The courage to accept a world of magic, a world of witches...`
`...That alone wouldn't change the fact that I was locked up in an academy,`
` without a single friend in my class.`
`But I was having such a fun and merry time regardless.`
`.........I'll become a witch like Maria onee‐chan.`
`And someday, I'll add my family to this happy circle.`
`Mom, Dad.`
` And Onii‐chan.`
`......If possible, George onii‐chan and Jessica onee‐chan, too.`
` And my other relatives.`
`I'll call everyone, everyone here, without a single person missing, ...and we'll all be gathered together.`
`"......That is my...dream.`
` ......Yes,`
` and until I make it come true, I'm definitely not going to lose heart."`
`"I'm sure you'll become a Great Witch, Ange‐sama.`
` As long as you believe that.`
` We Seven Stakes of Purgatory will always serve by your side until that day comes."`
`"You'll be there...?`
` No matter how long,`
` ......you'll lend me your strength?"`
`"Of course.`
` After all, I'm your friend, right, Ange‐sama?"`
`"........................`
` ......Yes, you are.`
` Let's always stick together and play together.`
` Today, and in the future...forevermore."`
`"Until the day you can make your dream come true."`
`The lively, ten‐person game of shiritori,`
` cut off from time alongside the street, under the forever bright warmth of the sun, continued without end......`
`".........What. The. Hell. {i:Seriously}, Ushiromiya‐saan?"`
`".............................."`
`......In the end,`
` I wasn't able to make a very good grade on my test.`
`I had thought I'd memorized things, in my own way,`
` but if you could manage anything by cramming all night like that, no one would worry about tests.`
`"Normally, when you know the questions beforehand, you'd ace it easily, right? Easily!"`
`"It's true that we didn't go so far as to write the answers into the blanks for you.`
` We thought you'd have the sense to study at least that much."`
`"Oh my God!`
` No frigging way. This is... God almighty...!`
` They're almost all wrong, aren't they?`
` Did you really actually study for this?!"`
`"..................More or less..."`
`"This isn't what you call more or less, Ushiromiya‐san.`
` ......My mind is reeling from how horrible this is."`
`"O Lord.`
` Please forgive her for getting a miserable grade on such an easy test,`
` and plummeting the average score for the entire class...!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*,`
` ahahahahahahaha."`
`......The same test had been given to another class first.`
`{n}They had managed to get hold of that test paper, so the average score for this test was unusually high.`
`Enough to obscure my slight improvement.`
`However, ......there were some things that I couldn't make an excuse for.`
`If I had spent that entire day studying like mad, I might have been able to get a slightly higher score.`
`......But I hadn't gone that far.`
`After all, after that on that day,`
` ......I had spent the time having fun playing shiritori with the Seven Sisters, Sakutaro, and Onee‐chan.`
`As expected, the winner had been Maria onee‐chan.`
`{n}She had been a strong player because of her various bits of random knowledge.`
`Sakutaro had gotten the penalty.`
`He had spent the whole time cheering for everyone else's answers,`
` and had completely forgotten to think of any himself.`
`......Because of that, he got dogpiled by the Seven Sisters and had his ears thoroughly nibbled, didn't he?`
`"Excuse me, are you listening, Ushiromiya‐san?!"`
`"..........................."`
`They were surrounding me, twittering like small birds.`
`{n}Annoying, smelly.`
`On the outside of that circle was Mammon, a weary expression on her face...`
`"This school is as messed up as always.`
` If their own grades are good, shouldn't they be more than happy?"`
`".........It's probably because of that collective responsibility thing.`
` Instead of worrying about their own grades,`
` they're more concerned about how embarrassing it is for the class average to be low."`
`"Or maybe it's because they really really hate the volunteer work they're forced to do as punishment."`
`"So in other words, they aren't studying because they want their grades to be good,`
` but because of collective responsibility and because they hate volunteer work?"`
`"......They're jealous and embarrassed.`
` They don't want to be inferior to anyone, and they don't want to be humiliated.`
` That's the only feeling that drives them to study."`
`"What noisy people. If they want to study, why can't they just do it themselves?"`
`"In the end,`
` without collective responsibility and volunteer work, they'd have no desire to study.`
` ......How foolish it is to study without knowing the meaning of studying."`
`"Wow, these guys are so annoying and stupid!`
` Stop disturbing Ange‐sama's precious lunchtime!"`
`"Waaah, I hate these guyyyys!!`
` Just go awayyyyy!!"`
`"I'm huuungryyyyyy!!`
` Disappear already, waaaah!!"`
`"..................`
` .........I'm sorry, everyone.`
` I wonder why {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s are so despicable."`
`"It's probably because, instead of working hard themselves,`
` forcing you to put the effort in is the easier way for them to greedily boost the class average.`
` ......Humans are all greedy.`
` And they'll burden others with that to make things easier for themselves."`
`"...We'll eventually be reunited with them on the Mountain of Purgatory.`
` When they get to the fifth terrace, they better watch their step..."`
`Mammon controls the fifth terrace of the mountain that reaches to Paradise: Mount Purgatory.`
`......Given that she herself was promising them this, we can probably be sure that after those girls die, their journey to heaven will not be an easy one.`
`...No, in fact, why don't they just go to hell.`
`The class committee had applied to the student council to use a classroom during lunch and after school.`
`The purpose of use was for a class study group.`
` A wonderful little gathering so that they can all collect around me and make me study. I'm overjoyed.`
`Which meant that every day, I would have all of my lunch and three hours of my afternoon stolen away from me.`
`The academy and its student council, with its motto of student self‐government,`
` instantly approved of this pleasant activity that the students were taking up of their own initiative...`
`In other words, I would no be longer able to escape after school by leaving the classroom...`
`After school, the first class study group meeting started right away.`
`Would they open a textbook, then kindly and carefully explain so that even I could understand it?`
` Of course it was nothing like that naive fantasy.`
`After school in the classroom, around a dozen of my classmates crowded around my desk.`
`First, before we started studying...`
`Why were my grades so bad?`
` What was the reason?`
`{n}It was decided that we couldn't start until I could clearly answer those questions, become aware of the problem, and show remorse for my actions.`
`......Of course, there was no way I had an answer to a question like that.`
`They had avoided me like the plague up until now.`
` And they had rejected me and kept me at a distance so as not to include me in their communities.`
`So I had been avoiding their communities myself.`
` There shouldn't have been any conflict between us that way.`
`So even when they formed this community intent on raising the class average,`
` I obviously kept well away from it.`
`Even if I had tried to join in,`
` they would probably have ignored me, just like they had always done in the past.`
`"If you'd just have asked, we'd have taught you as much you wanted.`
` Wouldn't weeeee?!"`
`"""We wouuuuuuuld!!!"""`
`Such enthusiasm.`
` ......I'd had enough of their ex‐post‐facto pretenses of charity.`
`"Ushiromiya‐san, the thing that's bad about you is you're lacking a cooperative attitude.`
` You only think about yourself—it's that selfish way of thinking that's the problem."`
`"Those who gather in Saint Lucia's place of learning shall have a cooperative heart.`
` It is written right there in the student handbook, you know?"`
`"I think if you have a cooperative attitude,`
` that's what gives birth to the desire to study together and contribute to the entire class.`
` I think {i:that's} the most fundamental thing that you're lacking, how about you?!"`
`"Heeey, have you been listening to us?!`
` We've gone to all the trouble of staying after school to have this talk {i:for your sake}, you know?!"`
`.....................`
`The tears of gratitude are pouring down.`
`Of course, they didn't like that.`
`"This way, it almost makes it look like we're bullying you", they scolded me.`
`Fortunately, I'm normally all cried out anyway.`
`{n}If I'm told not to cry, I can hold it back.`
`First, I was to write a letter of remorse and read it out loud.`
`Of course, they meant today.`
`The class president politely applied to the student council and the staff room for an extension on the use of the classroom.`
`......Apparently it was accepted right away.`
`Which meant that, starting now, I would be forced into self‐criticism here for at least a full five hours......`
`{m:-5:―}―I, Ushiromiya Ange, caused trouble for my classmates by getting a low score on my test.`
`"That's not iiiiiit!!"`
`"You getting low grades and causing us trouble isn't the root of the problem, right?!"`
`"It's a cooperative attitude, a cooperative attitude!!"`
`"Come ooon!!`
` Why do we even have to guide you on how to write a letter of remorse?!"`
`Their abusive jeers flew about one after another.`
`I followed their "guidance" and put the eraser to it.`
`{m:-5:―}―I, Ushiromiya Ange, caused trouble for my classmates by not having a cooperative attitude.`
`"Hey, wait a sec, it's pointless if you just write whatever we say!"`
`"Do you even frigging know what "remorse" means?!"`
`"It's pointless if you don't write it in your own words, pointless!"`
`"I've always thought you were a bit strange, Ushiromiya‐san, but you really are an odd one!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`Even following their guidance didn't change the jeers much; in fact, now it felt like they were mocking me more as well...`
`In this way, over the following several hours, without rest, without being allowed to go to the bathroom,`
` of course without being permitted to have dinner, and while being continuously insulted...`
`......I was coerced into writing a document which humiliated myself......`
`And as it passed nine at night, ......I was told to stand up and read it aloud.`
`The contents...`
`...were smeared black with tears and eraser marks.`
`It certainly was my handwriting,`
` ......but it was like a list of soulless letters,`
` whose contents I couldn't even remember.`
`Everything had been copied down according to their guidance.`
`So while I had been the one to write the letters, they weren't my words.`
`I was being coerced into writing it down, and even coerced into reading it aloud.`
`.........I was surprised to find that even after all this time, in addition to ignoring someone and hiding their things,`
` there were still other ways, like this, to bully people......`
`"Come onnn!`
` Hurry up and read it out!!"`
`"Look how many people are staying this late just for you, Ushiromiya‐san.`
` How about a little gratitude?"`
`"Isn't the fact that she doesn't feel gratitude for that indicative of her not having a scrap of cooperative attitude?"`
`"It's alright, Ushiromiya‐san.`
` We'll always be with you from now on.`
` Why not study with us and remake yourself?`
` Okay?"`
`"*giggle*giggle* “Ahahahahaha “Kyahhhya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya!!””"`
`Still surrounded by them, I stood from my seat......and dropped my gaze towards the blackened page.`
`And then......I began to speak those humiliating words,`
` but right away, jeers flew at me saying that they couldn't hear and to speak up.`
`...............I can't read this.`
`I had no idea...`
`that being forced to read a paragraph humiliating me would be so painful.`
`My throat shook.`
` My fingertips shook.`
` ......The paragraph of humiliation written in my own handwriting made my eyes burn with a hot liquid.`
`So my world blurred and twisted.`
`The girls surrounding me all appeared warped.`
`......I saw them warped into exactly the impression I had of them.`
`In other words, ......this was the correct view.`
`Beyond that twisted crowd of people, ......I could see my friends.`
`Compassion could be seen in all of their eyes.`
`".........Ange, .........stay strong..."`
`‘Uryuu.........’`
`Maria onee‐chan and Sakutaro were looking at me with sad eyes.`
`{n}Perhaps because they realized that even cheap words of compassion would hurt me.`
`......They kept alternating between trying to say something, and hanging their heads.`
`"What the hell's wrong with these people...!!"`
`"They're such dirtbags!`
` Really pisses me off!`
` What's so fun about ganging up on Ange‐sama and tormenting her?!"`
`"The resentment of not being able to spit out their jealousy.`
` Anyone would do, just as long as they can spit it out.`
` They're the worst."`
`"Ange‐sama!`
` In this kind of situation, going mad with rage for the sake of your own honor is perfectly acceptable!!`
` Anger is an appropriate emotion and an appropriate reaction!`
` If you don't get mad now, when {i:are} you going to?!!"`
`"Stop it, don't stir Ange‐sama up with cheap anger!!`
` If Ange‐sama could do that, she would have done it already!!"`
`"...............If the situation could improve by you getting angry, then that is what you should do.`
` However, objectively speaking, that would only serve to aggravate the situation further.`
` ......It may be humiliating, but the wisest thing to do now is to withstand it."`
`"Ahha!`
` You really are a sloth, Belphe‐nee!`
` Screw that, I can't stand this!!`
` I can't forgive them!!"`
`‘...E‐everyone, settle down...`
` You're putting a burden on Ange...’`
`"A burden?!`
` What are you talking about? Is this the time or place to be calm?!`
` We furniture are not so cruel as to be able to coolly watch our master being humiliated!!"`
`"Ange‐sama!!`
` You have no obligation to read such a humiliating essay!`
` If you can't let out a cry of rage, then at least throw that insulting message onto the floor!!"`
`"You don't need to trash‐talk them, you don't need to yell so loud that they bend over backwards!`
` Just throw that notebook on the floor with all your might...!!`
` That's all you need to do to show how strong‐willed you are!!"`
`"Don't be so irresponsible!!`
` I told you already!`
` If Ange‐sama could do that, she would have done so long ago!!"`
`"Nothing will be resolved by the eruption of momentary emotions.`
` Why don't you understand that doing that will only worsen the criticism Ange‐sama is receiving?!"`
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!`
` Why is this happening to Ange‐sama when she didn't do anything wrong?!"`
`"Not letting her eat dinner, and making her stay so long after school! I hate iiiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`"And it's not just tonight, it's tomorrow and the day after too!!`
` Give me a break! I can't bear this humiliation!!"`
`"Excuse me!! Are you actually listening to us?!"`
`Someone tugged at my hair.`
`{n}......I was pulled back into miserable reality.`
`...I was no longer even permitted to listen to the Seven Sisters expressing my inner thoughts on my behalf.`
`My hair was lifted upwards, one of my hair ornaments came off, and I heard it bounce and then roll on the ground.`
`......No one picked it up.`
`To the contrary, they casually avoided it as though something filthy had come rolling towards them.`
`I tried to follow it with my eyes, but my hair was tugged upwards again.`
`"Why is it that you're {i:never} listening, even though we're trying to have a real serious talk with you?!"`
`"In one ear and out the other, is it?`
` Or maybe we're talking to a brick wall?!`
` Get a grip, alright?!"`
`"Are you really conscious of the trouble you're causing all of us?`
` You better not be about to say you just wrote that grudgingly because we told you to!"`
`"Until you can really feel remorse by yourself, this seriously isn't gonna end, get it?!`
` It's not just gonna be today.`
` This is seriously gonna keep on going tomorrow and the day after, you got that?!`
` I'm warning you, don't push your luck with us!!"`
`"Like, more to the point, what are you even still alive for?`
` Could you guys go on like this?`
` If it were me, I'd just die!"`
`"Yeah, I could never live this way!`
` Think about it, just by being alive, you'd be getting in other people's way all the time, right?`
` If it were me, I definitely couldn't live on!"`
`"Yeah, yeah, I'd die too.`
` If that's better for the world, I'd die on the spot! Wouldn't yooooou?!!"`
`{a:c:`
`......Then die.}`
`"Ange‐sama......"`
`"Kill them all, immediately!!`
` Lucifer, did you hear me?!"`
`"Huh?! ......Ah..."`
`"You Seven Sisters of Purgatory are incredible furniture that can massacre mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s in a flash, right?!`
` You're always boasting about it to me!!"`
`"Then do it!`
` Kill them all right now!!`
` Right here, right now!!"`
`".........But..............."`
`For some reason, Lucifer's speech faltered.`
`"......Why?`
` What's wrong?!`
` You're certain‐kill furniture that can fly around faster than the eye can see, and instantly strike through the hearts of the witch's enemies, aren't you?`
` And I am giving you an order as your master!!"`
`"Carry it out right away!`
` Kill them!!`
` KILL THEM AA{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}AALL!!"`
`"........................A‐Ange‐sama......`
` ...Please, calm down......"`
`If they had immediately followed my brutal order, and left corpses strewn all around me...`
`......I would have been ready to rue my own reckless actions of stealing human lives so readily—I was ready to regret and feel remorse, just as they had wanted me to.`
`I was prepared to go through that.`
`And yet, Lucifer just let an unsure expression rise to her face, and didn't move to carry out my order.`
`..................I was aware.`
`Of course I was.`
` ......Vaguely.`
`{n}No, that's not it.`
` ......I {i:knew} it from the very beginning.`
`I knew, didn't I......that magic was all empty......`
`"......The Seven Sisters of Purgatory? Yeah, right...`
` ......Worthless, worthless...`
` ............I knew it from the very beginning......"`
`"............A‐......Ange‐sama...`
` ............{nobr:g—...{m:-5:———}—}......!!!"`
`I glared into the worthless Lucifer's eyes.`
`...And it seemed that pain accompanied that stare.`
`{n}As though she had been struck by a horrendous headache, Lucifer clutched her head with both hands.`
`But it looked like she couldn't tear her eyes off my glare.`
`{n}......So the pain assaulting her grew more and more intense.`
`"......................................."`
`"Guhgggg, a......ghhhgaaa, agaa.........!!`
` Ahghhk!!!"`
`You are useless, useless......!!`
` I HATE you!!`
` Disappear...!!`
` {i:You're nothing but a delusion inside my head}...!!!`
`Hopelessness and disappointment.`
` Resignation and a dream's end.`
` A cracking sound, like you'd hear from a frozen lake's surface during a fierce winter, rang out just once.`
`Simultaneously, Lucifer's form, tormented by violent pain, stiffened in place and grew cloudy.`
`......It was almost as though a beautifully polished glass window...`
`had been heartlessly smashed and turned white from the countless cracks.`
`And that was an accurate analogy.`
` At some point, Lucifer's form had turned into a glass ornament of the same shape.`
`Countless fissures ran through it from the inside, and the head and arms fell to pieces as it crumbled to the floor.`
`"Hiiyii?!!"`
`"L‐Luci‐nee...!!"`
`"............Who's the second sister...?`
` Leviathan?`
` Carry out my order.`
` Kill them all right NOW!!"`
`"W‐well, um!`
` ......Err, Ange‐sama...`
` ......Please calm your heart and listen...`
` We, umm,`
` .........{m:-5:——}—...`
`mmgwaaGHHggggggah{m:-5:—}—`
`GAHAGH!!"`
`I'm not looking for excuses or back talk or a reply.`
`{n}......I want nothing more than a swift confirmation of my order to eradicate the girls who are humiliating me.`
`If you're going to say anything else, there's no need for me to listen until the end.`
`After Leviathan turned white from the vast number of cracks throughout her whole body,`
` frozen in a bent‐backwards pose, she toppled over, and her fragile neck, hips and arms broke into separate parts.`
`It would have been less brutal if they had just smashed to smithereens instead of retaining their original form.`
`So the fact that I had left the two of them partially intact...`
`made the remaining younger sisters shake even harder...`
`"......Why won't you listen to my orders...?`
` Why?`
` WHY?!!"`
`"M‐my apologies...!!`
` H‐here, under the current conditions, the anti‐magic power is...e‐extremely strong...and—"`
`"{i:What}.`
` You can't do it because {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s are here? {i:That's} your logic?`
` Isn't killing {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s what you {i:do}?!`
` If you can't do that, then WHAT USE are you as furniture?!!`
` DIE!!!"`
`"Hiii—!!"`
`"P‐please, spare me, Ange‐samaaaaa......ah,`
` nghk,`
` ghhgaaaah, khack!!"`
`As she clutched her head with both arms, Satan also turned white and fell down face first.`
`The neck really did seem to be the most fragile part.`
`{n}Her head broke off weightily and rolled over to Belphegor's feet.`
`"You can't do it because there are too many {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s?`
` Then if I were to call them into the shadows later one by one,`
` you're saying you guys could make a bloodbath of all of them?"`
`"......With your current magical power, it may be easy for you to converse with us.`
` However, you still lack the training in magical power to manifest us in front of all of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s here...!"`
`"I deeply understand your anger, but even if you could use us to attack,`
` murdering everyone here would only make the situation worse...!`
` I do think it humiliating, but please, if you could control your anger for the time being—"`
`".........ggg, gah,`
` ......ghhhhh...ggg...gaHAGHHH!!"`
`"...............Will I get the same answer from the remaining three...?`
` Going to tell me you can't do it because the anti‐magic power is too great?`
` Going to tell me you can't do it because my magical power is too weak?"`
`"......Then I won't ask you to kill all of them.`
` Let's see you just kill one.`
` Right here, right now...!!"`
`As Asmodeus and Beelzebub held each other, they crouched down, cringing in fear under my glare.`
`......If they had been able to obey my order, they would probably have carried it out immediately.`
`{n}And yet, here they were crouching down.`
`......Empty.`
` Sad.`
` And pathetic......`
`That's right—I knew it.`
` These girls can't touch reality with even a single one of their fingers......`
`"N‐...no, no...!!`
` Belzie, I'm scared, Belzieeeee!!"`
`"Ange‐sama, spare us, spare us...!!`
` I don't want to diiiiiiiieee!!"`
`"Die, useless furniture!`
` Why are you guys even alive?`
` Why are you alive when your lives are worthless?`
` You could just die.`
` Die, please.`
` Drop fucking dead!!`
` Do you think there's anyone stupid enough to leave furniture lying around without a use?!"`
`""HiiiIiiI!!`
` {m:-5:———}—gaaahh!!!""`
`"P‐please stop, Ange‐sama!!"`
`"......What is it, Mammon?`
` Will you be the only one to fulfill my order?`
` Of course you will.`
` You're my best friend.`
` ............You alone will do what the others wouldn't...`
`and {i:kill them}!"`
`"............A‐as you are now, Ange‐sama, ......even if you use us, you're not capable of committing murder!!`
` It is the duty of furniture to help with things its master can do...!"`
`"Things that even the master can't do, we can't do...!!`
` Do you hate these girls, Ange‐sama?`
` You hate them, don't you?"`
`"I understand why you want to kill them, really, I do!!`
` Alright, in that case, let's go ahead and kill them, Ange‐sama!`
` If you will stain your own hands with blood, then we, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, will go along with you however far! However far!!"`
`"......I'm......asking you guys.........because I can't do it myself, aren't I......`
` ......Isn't being able to do things I can't...the thing that makes you furniture?!!"`
`"Yes, we are furniture.`
` Furniture to be used...!!"`
`"Please, go ahead and use us to kill!`
` You'll be the one killing, Ange‐sama!!`
` If you're saying that you want to kill, then go ahead, be my guest!`
` No need to hesitate, please, go and carry it out right now!!"`
`"And once you have that level of mental resolve,`
` once you're prepared to dirty your own hands—then, we will help you!`
` But you haven't reached that stage!!"`
`"Pft, .........heheheheh, ahahahahaha...`
` Ahahahahahahahaha, don't speak, you furniture.`
` You DELUSION!!"`
`"I get it already, don't make me say it all out loud.`
` ...You guys can't do anything.`
` You are nothing more than my delusions, illusions, daydreams...!"`
`"I haven't had a single friend from the very beginning.`
` You're just a phantom, a pretend friend lonely old me created inside my heart, aren't you?`
` I knew that—from the very beginning!!!"`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Yes, that's right!`
` We're a fantasy inside your head, got a problem with that?`
` Yes, it's truuue!"`
`"We're just imaginary friends,`
` created to soothe lonely, lonely Ange‐sama's heart because she doesn't have a single solitary friend, wanna say something about it?"`
`"If you want to look at reality, just look at it.`
` Stop looking at us and go back to being yourself over there, completely boxed in and bombarded with abuse!!"`
`"Go on then, go on, back you go, back to reality!!`
` Just call on us only when it's convenient for you and pretend you have friends,`
` set us on your enemies when you don't have the guts to dirty your own hands, and deny and erase us once you realize that's not gonna work!"`
`"Yes, I'll leave with a shriek of anguish just like you want, go ahead and enjoy it!!"`
`"Just copy the jeering that you're being bombarded with right now,`
` and do the same to us to get it off your chest."`
`"That too is the duty of furniture!!`
` Getting slammed against the floor when someone's pissed off is also a chair's important duty!!"`
`"If by that trifling service we manage to absorb our master's bad mood even for an instant,`
` there can be no greater honor for furniture.`
` Kill me, deny me, your first and final friend...!!!!!!!"`
`At the end, Mammon had a derisive expression on her face,`
` ......but for some reason it looked like teardrops had scattered from her eyes.`
`Mammon, Beelzebub and Asmodeus smashed to pieces and rolled across the floor......`
`‘.........U‐......uryu..................’`
`"..................`
` Come over here, Sakutaro.`
` Ange is just a little agitated right now.`
` ......So you mustn't get close."`
`‘What about the others?`
` Are the Seven Sisters alive?`
` Did they die...?’`
`"......It's alright.`
` It looks very gruesome, but those are the remains of their vessels after they were forcibly evicted from the human world.`
` They're shells that have been shed."`
`"......So it's alright.`
` They're probably deeply hurt, but they're safe.`
` They're all alive.`
` I'm sure we'll be able to meet them again someday."`
`‘Uryu...`
` ......Thank goodness..........thank goodness............’`
`"......Ange, you violated the treaty of Mariage Sorcière.`
` ......Doing such a horrible thing, ......even though witches of the alliance must respect and accept one another......`
` They were all your precious friends......"`
`"No witches' alliance has anything to do with this.`
` Magic friends? Give me a break.`
` .........I killed them, erased them.`
` I smashed the Seven Sisters!"`
`‘Uryu......that's so cruel......so cruel.........’`
`"......Just give it a rest with this playing witches thing.`
` .....Please.`
` Maria onee‐chan and Sakutaro, I want you to disappear by yourselves.`
` .........Because even amid my delusions, ......I don't want to kill or erase you."`
`‘W‐...we aren't delusions......`
` We're your friends, Ange... Uryu.........!’`
`Sakutaro sobbed those words as he hid behind Maria onee‐chan.`
`.........Sakutaro doesn't exist.`
`Sakutaro is also...a delusion Onee‐chan created to distract herself from her loneliness.........`
`‘U‐......uryu, .........it hurts, ......it hurts, Maria......`
` ......Why? Why...?`
` Uryu.........uryu.........’`
`"Stop it.`
` Denying my friend is the one thing I will not permit."`
`The same power that had smashed the Seven Sisters was probably eating into Sakutaro as well.`
`......But Maria onee‐chan was apparently protecting him with some other power.`
`So Sakutaro's form didn't break or scatter.`
`Onee‐chan glared at me sharply.`
`{n}......A serious expression that she had never shown me before.`
`"Sakutaro is my furniture.`
` You cannot erase him, Ange.`
` ......That you would try to deny him regardless is the greatest contempt you could show a witch."`
`"Sakutaro never existed in the first place.`
` He's just a lion stuffed animal.`
` Just a phantom you personified in the delusions inside your own mind!"`
`"Uu!!!`
` That's not true!!`
` Sakutaro is my friend!!`
` He was a stuffed animal once, but now he isn't!!"`
`"No, he's a stuffed animal.`
` A stuffed animal made of cloth and cotton!`
` He can't move or talk by himself!`
` You're just talking for him like a ventriloquist!"`
`"Is that what you call magic?`
` Is that what you call a witch?!`
` Is that what you call......a friend?!`
` I can't accept that!!"`
`‘........................Uryu......`
` .........Am I...`
`......not me......?’`
`‘......Am I......just a stuffed animal that...`
`can't really talk and...`
`.........not your...`
`...friend...`
`............after all............?’`
`‘U......ryu.........’`
`As though plagued by a high fever, Sakutaro weakened bit by bit.`
`As he clung to Onee‐chan's body, he did all he could to continue standing,`
` ......but his body began to slip down bit by bit...`
`As he did, Onee‐chan held him, and screamed at me as tears streamed down her face...`
`"Uuuu!!`
` Stop iiiit!!`
` Don't burn Sakutaro with the anti‐magic toxin!!`
` Don't bully him!!`
` Don't insult him!`
` Don't deny him!!!!!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*!!`
` Maria onee‐chan, you're weeeeird!!`
` There is no Sakutaro~!`
` Stuffed animals are stuffed anima~ls!"`
`"I learned from Mama that they're made of cloth and cotton~!!`
` There's no way they can walk or tal~k!!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!!"`
`‘.........Uryu........................u...yu...............’`
`"Sakutaro!!`
` Sakutaroo!!!`
` He's not a stuffed animal, he's not a stuffed animal, he's a friend!!`
` Uuu!!!`
` Waa{0}aAA{0}Aa{0}a{0}aAa{0}a{0}aahhhh!!!!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!`
` I don't wanna play with stupid animals, let's all play outsi~de!!`
` I'm bored with animals no~w!!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"NO, you're not my friend any more!!`
` Uu!!`
` Why would you say that, I hate you I hate you I hate you I hate you!!`
` I HATE YOU!!"`
`You're not my friend!!`
` I won't let you be one of us witches anymore...!!`
`Upon my name, the Apprentice Witch of Origins {f:5:Maria},`
` I hereby expel the apprentice witch {f:5:Ange} from the Mariage Sorcière Alliance of Witches......!!`
`.........And then.`
`...Those tranquil days of mine, now merely a waking dream, came to an end.`
`At this point, it's unverifiable.`
`No one can verify whether that really was magic, and those really were my friends,`
` or else whether it was all nothing more than a daydream.`
`......I, the sole observer, concluded that those girls were a figment of my imagination.`
`......So that became the truth.`
`Perhaps, further in the future, I will observe it again, and when that happens, maybe I will acknowledge that it wasn't a dream,`
` ......that the Seven Sisters really were my friends, and that along with Maria onee‐chan and Sakutaro,`
` they did everything they could for me in my isolation.`
`..................Something so vague is neither the truth nor even an illusion.`
`Maybe the reality that's here and now is the only real world, with the real me.`
`Where is the real me?`
`The person standing among the girls' shameful remains resembling broken glass sculptures,`
` breathing harshly and shoulders heaving, ...that is not me.`
`The place {i:I} am......is over there.`
`The one boxed in by a crowd, the one being subjected to constant verbal abuse, ...the one hanging her head, with clearly red eyes.........`
`......The me over there,`
` .........isn't {i:that} the real me......?`
`I won't...dream...anymore.`
`{n}Because there's nowhere...for me to run.`
`I'll...go back.`
` ......I'll return myself...to the cage made of flesh......`
`"Hey!!`
` Are you listening to us?!`
` Standing there hanging your head forever won't solve anything, you know?!"`
`"..............................`
` ......I hear you."`
`"Ah, you finally answered.`
` Are you thinking that this'll end eventually if you just stay silent, or that we'll forgive you if you cry, or something like that?!`
` We're asking if you are aware!`
` We're asking if you are aware of the trouble you're causing those around you...!!"`
`.........I...slowly nodded.`
` ...I admitted it.`
`I admitted that I had been spending my time in a waking dreamland, trying to remain separate from the others in my class.`
`......Those "friends" who had spoken to me with such kind and hopeful words,`
` yet who couldn't offer me any help at all now in the moment I truly wanted it—`
`to move on from them and to sully them,`
` ......I admitted it.`
`"...I, Ushiromiya Ange, caused trouble for my classmates by not having a cooperative attitude.`
` The reason for it is nothing more or less than my excessive inferiority complex towards all of my classmates because of my inability to study.`
` And.............................."`
`".........there's no point in me being alive."`
`Starting there, I was no longer reading the paragraph they had made me write.`
`......It was my...improvisation.`
` And...what was in my heart.`
`They also noticed that it wasn't what they had anticipated,`
` but while they did frown, no one spoke.`
`So I continued.`
`"......That's right.`
` There was no point in my life continuing.`
` ......I was meant to have been taken with them on that day in 1986.`
` ......And yet, I was the only one who didn't get to be taken."`
`"......Why am I here, I wonder?`
` ...This isn't the world I'm meant to be in.`
` ............No one will save me here."`
`"...For a time, ......I felt as though the fictional friends I created inside myself would save me.`
` But those friends were nothing more than a delusion, ......and they did no such thing.`
` After all, this isn't a fantasy world—it's the real world."`
`".........So, in short, ......up until today, ......I've been living in a daydream.`
` ...Averse to my real classmates, I lived only by interacting with the friends in my delusion.`
` .........Just now, I split up with those friends.`
` And here I am."`
`"............I have no family.`
` I've discarded my friends.`
` ......There is no longer anything left for me."`
`"......Why haven't I died?`
` One of you asked me that just now.`
` ...I think you're absolutely right.`
` Why.........am I alive, I wonder?`
` ..................I should have been dead............in 1986.`
` ...No, I did die then, I'm sure of it."`
`"But even so, ............my soul that was killed is still locked up inside this cage of flesh.`
` So I'll ask this of one of you.`
` If no one responds, ......I'll do it myself."`
`"Someone,`
` .....................please let me die."`
`I spoke that sentence, and looked around.`
`Dumbfounded girls.`
`{n}Shocked girls.`
`{n}Girls who looked like they didn't know what this kid was saying.`
`And, after a small delay,`
` more and more girls with faces that said "Is this kid alright?"`
`Whisper whisper.`
` Mutter mutter.`
` And then, giggle giggle.`
`.........When I ordered my friends in my daydream to kill, they couldn't do it.`
`And so,`
` I asked real {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s to kill,`
` ......but of course, these girls can't do it either.`
`......In other words, both daydreams and reality are the same.`
`Doesn't that mean that everything, absolutely everything, this world included...`
`{n}............is all a daydream?`
`Then......what's the problem.`
`After all, ......on that day when I lost my entire family, ...I already died.`
`......All the days since have been the delusions of a wrongful survivor—delusions of a life flashing before my eyes.`
`Once I understood that, ...............it felt like all the scenery surrounding me began to twist and bend slightly.`
`.........Ah.`
`{n}...I'm finally going to.........wake up.`
`{n}...I'm going to be released...from this world of waking dreams.`
`I felt my consciousness sliding away.`
`......That's alright.`
` Fade further and further away, ............and take me to my family......`
`Therefore, no matter what unfolded in this twisted, faded world, I paid it no mind at all.`
`I saw the crowd get pushed aside as a teacher stepped in.`
`Perhaps a teacher doing the rounds happened to notice a strange disturbance.`
`The teacher was vigorously shouting something, moving to protect me.`
`......Upon seeing that, and learning that an ally had appeared for me, even if only one,`
` I felt my awareness return very slightly.`
`..................`
`......The only ones who can save me in the real world...are real {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.`
`Never again.`
` ......Never again will I seek salvation from daydreams.`
`.........This is the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world.`
`The only ones who can save a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}...are other {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s......`
`"...........................`
` ......Yes.`
` If that's what you think, then that's your world, Ange."`
`‘......Can Ange...`
`...become happy this way.........?’`
`".........If Ange believes that is the only way to become happy, then it is the only way.`
` ...If she cannot accept the blue bird in the cage for what it is,`
` ...then she must go and search forever."`
`‘Uryu......`
` ...Maria, are you......breaking off relations with Ange.........?’`
`"..............................`
` ......No, nothing like that.`
` I only did that because it was what Ange wanted.`
` ......We witches are sometimes persecuted.`
` However, we are always close by.`
` ......And our aid will surely be sought."`
`‘......Will the day come.........when Ange will play with us again......?’`
`"It may be that it never comes, and we will simply be forgotten.`
` ...In the human world, they call that growing up, or moving on.`
` ............Still."`
`If Ange just remembers, we will always be by her side.`
`......And until then, ......we will be waiting.`
