`......It was......a pitch‐black room.`
`There were no windows, and by the light from the weak bulb, one could only just barely make out the state of things around them.`
`It appeared to be an old, forgotten, dusty underground storehouse, with some kind of furniture haphazardly thrown into it......`
`However, even with just a little light, one could at least tell that it probably wasn't a storehouse.`
`......Because that room was sealed off with iron bars.`
`"......Where...is this.........?"`
`"Not a clue...`
` ......Is this place underneath the mansion......?`
` Was there this kind of room......directly underneath the dining hall......?"`
`They had been dropped into what had appeared to be a pit, and {i:fallen} into this room.`
`Therefore, it would be appropriate to think that this room was directly below the dining hall.`
`......However, not even Krauss could bring himself to believe that there were pitfalls rigged in the beloved dining hall, where he had enjoyed his meals for years,`
` ...and that directly below it was this dungeon‐like room.`
`But the ceiling, when they looked up, was made of rugged stone, ......and they could not understand from where in that ceiling they could have fallen.`
`No, all five people who had been dropped here thought the same thing.`
`Although they had felt a sensation of being dropped into a pit,`
` ......there was no way there could be pitfalls in the dining hall, nor could this dungeon‐like place be directly underneath it.`
`......But, in point of fact, they {i:had} fallen into this place, and were locked in.`
`{n}......And so, ...they were confused.`
`"......It is lucky that no one was hurt after falling from such a height..."`
`".........Shannon, Kanon.`
` Did either of you two know about this room...?"`
`"......No.`
` We also have no knowledge of any room like this."`
`"..................Really...?"`
`"R‐really......`
` We really......don't know any room like this......"`
`It seemed that Kyrie thought that there was a good chance that, despite their age,`
` they might know of the mansion's secret tricks as servants permitted the One‐winged Eagle.`
`There was a long silence, as if evaluating their answer...`
`"......No, it's probably true that they don't know.`
` Shannon is a very tidy person, after all."`
`"If she had known about this room, it would probably have been scrubbed until it was sparkling.`
` The filth of this room is proof that you two don't know of it.`
` ......More importantly than that, I think we should worry about what to do now, don't you?"`
`"E‐exactly......`
` We need to call the police...o‐or rather, call for medical assistance as soon as possible......"`
`Nanjo's words rang hollow.`
`...Obviously.`
`Six people had been killed in the dining hall.`
`{n}They had all witnessed the exact moments when the six had been killed.`
`And what's more, it had been done by half‐destroying their heads—`
`anyone could tell with just a single glance that they had been dealt a fatal injury.`
`Everyone understood that calling for an ambulance now would be completely meaningless......`
`"Thank you, Doctor Nanjo.`
` ......We already understand that our partners are no longer alive.`
` .........Thanks for trying to console us by mentioning medical assistance."`
`".........Natsuhi......`
` .............................."`
`Once again, an oppressive silence took control of them.`
`But Krauss shook his head harshly over and over, and decided just for now to forget the pain of losing his wife,`
` and dedicate himself to figuring out where they were.`
`"Everyone, listen to me.`
` ...............Dad is...`
`.........beyond hope now.`
` ...The time for words, and seeking comprehension or an explanation...`
`is long past."`
`Nobody answered.`
`......Without any kind of discussion or mercy, six people had been killed in an instant.`
`And Kinzo had so boldly proclaimed for them to become sacrifices in a thirteen‐person murder ritual.`
`......Since they had been locked up in this place,`
` they too would probably become the ritual's next sacrifices before long.`
`Around this time, their eyes were becoming used to the darkness,`
` and, bit by bit, they were starting to be able to make out the dungeon's interior.`
`......What they thought was furniture haphazardly left in the dungeon turned out not to be furniture at all.`
`They were......small cages that could be used to imprison a single person, restraining tables, ......or were those torture racks?`
`.....At any rate, it was obviously more ghastly than a mere jail cell.`
`Since those objects were rusted and covered in thick layers of dust, there was no doubt that they had been long‐forgotten.`
`......Maybe you could even have called those things Kinzo's sealed and forgotten madness.`
`However, it was this room in which they had now been locked away.`
`.........Those objects weren't exactly comforting to people who were locked up,`
` hoping to be released without harm...`
`"......Anyway, let's get out of here.`
` We've lost loved ones and friends and would like to spend some time shedding tears,`
` but more than that, ......I'm worried about the children."`
`".........I, ...I wonder if the children are safe......"`
`"All we can do is pray...`
` ......Come to think of it, Kumasawa‐san and Gohda‐san aren't here."`
`"Perhaps they were able to...get away safely..."`
`"You never know.`
` It'd be a relief if they were able to meet up with the children..."`
`"Gohda‐san can be relied upon in times of crisis, and Kumasawa‐san is knowledgeable and calm...`
` I'm sure they would be helpful to the children..."`
`"......Hahaha.`
` I hope so."`
`Shannon and Krauss smiled bitterly a little.`
` But they quickly realized how improper that was, and stopped, clearing their throats.`
`".........We can't be too optimistic, Nee‐san.`
` There's a chance that they have already been attacked, after we were."`
`"I agree.`
` What Father carried out in the dining hall was...`
`...the six murders of the first twilight from the witch's epitaph, right?`
` Then, the second twilight is to "tear apart the two who are close"."`
`"......We can't deny the possibility that Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san may have already been killed, having run away to hide together in close company.`
` .........We can't cling to the optimistic idea that they definitely got to the guesthouse and are protecting the children."`
`Kyrie coldly analyzed the worst‐case scenario.`
`Even for her, it was heartbreaking to have lost her beloved husband.`
`{n}......But right now, the most important thing was protecting that husband's son,`
` along with the other children, from becoming sacrifices to the insane family head.`
`She overcame her sadness with the parental urge to protect the children.`
`......It seemed that both Kyrie and Krauss were strong enough to forget their grief, if only for the time being...`
`They could let their tears flow later.`
`......For now, in order to protect the children, they had to act.`
`"Anyway, let's get out of here...`
` It seems to be a rather old cell.`
` Couldn't we break the bars somehow?`
` Let's try searching the entire room for some way to escape."`
`"There's all kinds of junk around here. I wonder if there are any tools lying around that we could use.`
` There might be something that we could use as a weapon, or something that we could use to break the bars."`
`Kyrie pulled a lighter from her pocket.`
`She herself didn't smoke, but she kept one tucked away in her pocket to light Rudolf's cigarettes.`
`......It was an extremely valuable source of light for searching through this dim dungeon.`
`"Shannon, help Kyrie‐san search the room.`
` Kanon, you'll help me check out the bars.`
` This is a very old cell.`
` The bars could be loose."`
`"Wh‐what should I help with......?"`
`"Please just keep up your strength.`
` ......Father will probably come here before long.`
` You're the only one whose words will reach him.`
` In a way, you might be holding our lives in your hands."`
`"......My words...will no longer reach him, I think.`
` I'm sorry, but I don't believe I will be of any use......"`
`"Then lend us your expertise as a doctor.`
` .........I wonder if there is a drug that makes people instantly faint?"`
`"......A drug that makes people instantly faint......?`
` What are you talking about......?"`
`"We believe we fell through a pit, and landed in this dungeon.`
` ......In that panic‐stricken place, that's what we believed happened."`
`"......But looking at how large this room is, I came to a realization.`
` This dungeon cannot be underneath the dining hall."`
`"How can you tell that it can't...?"`
`"............You're an idiot, Nee‐san.`
` This dungeon is too narrow compared to the dining hall."`
`"Exactly.`
` The first person to fall was Krauss nii‐san.`
` The second was myself.`
` When you fell into this room, did you move from that spot, Krauss nii‐san?"`
`"......It's embarrassing to say, but I lay there groaning in pain from the landing.`
` Immediately after that, you came crashing down next to me."`
`"The distance between us as we stood in the dining hall, compared to where we landed, is clearly strange."`
`"C‐...certainly, when you put it that way.`
` ......I was the next to fall, so I remember fairly well where you two were standing.`
` ......The distance between you two in the dining hall might have been greater than this entire room."`
`"We fell into a pit, and directly dropped down here.`
` ......It's not like we fell into multiple intersecting pipes, and were all collected together before falling down here."`
`"The fall was instant, wasn't it?`
` I don't remember rolling around in some sort of elaborate water pipe system."`
`"............Indeed, we can't explain that with a pitfall.`
` ...How strange."`
`"What does that have to do with......the drug that makes people instantly faint that Kyrie‐sama was talking about...?"`
`"...........................`
` ......Kyrie‐sama is probably thinking that there were no pitfalls in the dining hall, I would guess."`
`"But we did actually fall."`
`"To put it accurately, we had the feeling that we fell into a pit.`
` ......It's only natural.`
` That's the only way we could describe such an experience."`
`"I, I see......`
` In other words, this is what you're getting at..."`
`"......We were not dropped into a pit,`
` ......but shot, for example, with something like a blowdart, lost consciousness instantly, and the instant we fell to the floor,`
` it could be that we just remember that as though we fell into a pit......"`
`"............I see.`
` That's a much more persuasive explanation than there being numerous pitfall traps in the dining hall that we've never noticed, even after decades eating there."`
`"......Nee‐san.`
` Do you have a watch?"`
`"Huh?`
` .........Y‐...yes.`
` I have a pocket watch.`
` .........Umm, it's about twenty to eleven."`
`".........Yes.`
` My watch says the same.`
` ...In short, it hasn't been more than ten minutes since that chaos in the dining hall."`
`"My watch likewise.`
` ............That's much too short a time to knock us out and carry us somewhere.`
` .........Judging only from the time, it's reasonable to think that we did fall through a hole leading directly underneath the dining hall."`
`"Watch hands are easily tampered with.`
` ......While we were passed out, they may have wound everyone's watch back.`
` We are incapable of proving that this possibility doesn't exist."`
`"...........................`
` Whether a pitfall, or else a drug that induces fainting,`
` ......it does not change the fact that we need to be on our guard..."`
`"......So, Doctor Nanjo?`
` Is there a drug that can do that?"`
`"Well, ............`
` ......It's the same as your logic, Kyrie‐san.`
` ...I cannot prove that there is not a drug with that effect of which I do not know."`
`"......As they say, you can never be too careful.`
` ...Sorry, it was a pointless question.`
` Except, I think that with my hypothesis, I was able to suggest that this dungeon is not necessarily directly underneath the dining hall."`
`"I see...`
` .......There's always the possibility that we were carried off to a dungeon in Father's hidden mansion,`
` which is rumored to be hidden somewhere in the middle of the vast forest.`
` ......If we can escape from here and get outside, then we'll know.`
` We can save worrying about that until after we get out."`
`"Exactly.`
` I'm truly sorry.`
` I've only been asking and inquiring into useless things."`
`"No, it's quite reassuring.`
` Please continue to tell us if you notice anything else.`
` It might become a hint to escaping from here."`
`".........I always heard from Rudolf.`
` He was always surprised by your ideas, and they would sometimes serve as valuable hints.`
` ......The fact that you're here is a blessing within a tragedy."`
`"......Thank you.`
` Rudolf‐san told me something about you, as well.`
` He said that you usually act big, but when things get serious, you overflow with a sense of responsibility, and are a very dependable older brother."`
`"Hahaha... That's too kind.`
` .........Dammit, these iron bars won't even budge.`
` How are things on your end, Kanon?"`
`".........No luck here either, I'm afraid."`
`Krauss and Kanon tried wiggling each of the bars in various ways.`
`......There were a few bars that could be twisted,`
` and a few felt like they had enough room to rattle around a little bit,`
` but even so, they could not be broken with human strength alone.`
`......However, there was still hope if they could use some kind of lever‐like tool.`
`It was still far too early to give up yet.`
`The children's lives were hanging in the balance.`
` ......Even if there was no hope, they couldn't stop their struggle.`
`And it was better even for them to act this way.`
`......If they were to stop...there was no doubt that they would once again be overcome by the grief of losing their loved ones, and crouch down, clutching their knees......`
`"How are you doing, Kyrie‐san?`
` Found anything?"`
`"......I've found some stones small enough to hide in a clenched fist.`
` Even this might work as a weapon.`
` Though, I'm sure it'd be impossible to whittle down those iron bars.`
` How about you, Shannon‐chan...?"`
`"No, nothing."`
`".........Ah, this is...`
`............a phone."`
`"There's no way it's connected.`
` ......But, we might be able to use the cord for tying something up or as some form of weapon.`
` If we break it and take it apart, we could take out the metal parts.`
` Krauss nii‐san, there is a keyhole for opening the cell, right?"`
`"Yeah.`
` It's a pretty large hole, quite old fashioned.`
` ......If we twist some wire into it, we just might be able to pick it."`
`"We might be able to use the metal parts of the phone as a substitute for something.`
` ......This phone will become our weapon."`
`"It's the same as investing.`
` Information is our weapon."`
`Krauss and Kyrie laughed together at this way of putting the phone to use, which didn't remotely look at it as a means of communication.`
`"............What are you doing, Nee‐san."`
`"Ah, ......um, ...I just wondered if maybe...the phone was w‐working......"`
`"............({i:whisper}) You dummy, Nee‐san."`
`"Huh...?`
` .........What?"`
`Suddenly, Shannon let out a small surprised cry.`
`"K‐Kyrie‐sama...!`
` .....This phone, it's connected."`
`"What did you say...?"`
`It was like when people move out of an office, taking everything with them, leaving only the telephone behind—`
`that's the feeling the phone gave off, having been left in the corner of the cell.`
`The cord was wound into a coil, one end of it being swallowed by the wall,`
` and at a glance, it looked as if it could plausibly be connected.`
`......But, to think that it actually was...`
`Kyrie took the receiver from Shannon and pressed it to her ear.`
`{n}The electric hum was certainly the one with which she was familiar.`
`{n}......This phone was indeed live.`
`"Wh‐...what good luck...!`
` Let's contact the police...!"`
`"Hold on...!`
` This is too good to be true.`
` Should we not suspect that it's bugged...?!"`
`"If they were planning a trick like that, normally they would cut the telephone line.`
` ......There's a good possibility that they actually overlooked this."`
`"If they notice, the line might actually be cut for real.`
` There's nothing that we could tell the police that would be problematic for us if they overheard."`
`......That did make sense.`
` The point of a wiretap was to overhear some important piece of information,`
` but the way things were now, they could not think of a single thing that would come up in a conversation to the outside world that could be troublesome to have heard.`
`Kyrie instantly concluded that it was more likely to be a mistake on Kinzo's part than a trap......`
`"Y‐...you do have a point......`
` I believe that you start with 0 to make calls to the outside......"`
`"Kanon‐kun, I'm going to make a phone call, so will you watch how things are out there for me?`
` If you sense somebody coming, let me know."`
`"Y‐yes......!"`
`Kanon raced off towards the iron bars, silenced his breathing, and strained his ears......`
`{n}As everyone present watched her, Kyrie dialed {ruby:the police:110}...`
`However, she pushed the hook down repeatedly and redialed.`
`......It didn't seem to be working very well.`
`".........The outside line begins with 0?`
` 110 would be 0110 then, right?`
` It doesn't seem to want to go through..."`
`"Hand it over here, I'll try to call......`
` ..........................."`
`Krauss took the receiver in Kyrie's place, and tested various things......`
`But in the end, they were unable to notify the police......`
`The phone itself was definitely live, but the circuit was apparently cut somewhere.`
`......Did this mean that "they" were not so naive?`
`"......So it's useless after all......"`
`"So our enemy is no pushover...`
` ........................"`
`Kyrie let out a deep sigh, leaned against the wall, and hung her head for a while.`
`As tough a girl as she was, for a brief moment, she might actually have had the naive hope that the phone could actually work.`
`......She sneered at herself mockingly for holding onto that naive hope for even one moment.`
`And then, ......she thought back upon just what was happening here.`
`......Honestly...despite having been shown such a thing right before her eyes, ......or rather, exactly because of that...`
`......she still could not think of that gruesome mass murder as something real...`
`{n}It was less that she couldn't believe it, and more that she didn't want to.`
`Ushiromiya Kinzo had killed six members of his family.`
`He had summoned strange, witch‐like, demon‐like people,`
` ......right out of thin air, ......`
`.........and with something like magic,`
` ......he had begun to kill people one after another..........`
`...........................`
`Too much to handle.`
` ......Even though she definitely saw it, there was no way she could accept that spectacle......`
`".........There's no way that's what happened.`
` .........Those were obviously Grandfather's friends, or something.`
` ......They were just hiding somewhere in the dining hall beforehand, and used some trick to appear suddenly and surprise us.`
` .........There's no other way to explain something as screwed up as that."`
`But when those six had had their heads blown apart, a golden arrow had flown around and around the room.`
`......That had truly looked like...`
`...magic.`
`Was that another thing we just saw wrong?`
`{n}There's no way it was magic.`
` There must be some kind of trick to it.`
`......Since it was capable of smashing heads, there's no doubt it was some explosive.`
`For example, a styrene toy plane like they sell at candy stores, painted gold,`
` and with a powerful explosive loaded onto the end of it.`
`.......That said, at a glance, it had seemed to be flying at random;`
` Kyrie couldn't imagine that such a thing could be fired six times, and each time perfectly hit the victim square in the head, one after the other.`
`Surely its flight wasn't computer‐controlled to seek out and deliver precise hits on its targets,`
` which would make it a high‐tech styrene plane on the same level as a guided missile...?`
`".........Would he invest such a large amount of money into developing some stupid trick like that?`
` ......For that insane entertainment......?`
` Does this come back to the old "I wouldn't put it past Father"......?"`
`A number of mysterious people had appeared suddenly out of thin air,`
` ......six people had had their heads demolished by a mysterious golden flying object,`
` ......and the five of us were locked away in a mysterious dungeon by a mysterious set of pitfalls, or else put to sleep by some fainting poison dart......`
`The family conference started a bit after 10 p.m.`
`{n}......It's only been about thirty minutes since then.`
`Probably,`
` those events, which took place in such a short amount of time,`
` ......none of us are able to understand, nor come to grips with, even though we witnessed them ourselves.`
`Even if we did get ahold of the police,`
` it would probably be impossible for any of us to accurately explain what we saw......`
`I may only just have witnessed it,`
` ......but my brain's fried, and I have no confidence even in what I myself saw...`
`Kyrie had to try her hardest to rouse herself from her overwhelming confusion, just to hold onto her sanity......`
`"Dammit......what's going on here,`
` ......damn, ...dammit...!"`
`Krauss started to become desperate, hitting the hook multiple times, and redialing over and over.`
`......He too was feigning composure, but was unable to hide his panic.`
`The more he redialed, the more the pretense of serenity peeled away...`
`None of this makes any sense......`
`Kyrie couldn't help but pray that the events that had just occurred were no more than a dream...`
`.........Suddenly, the look on Krauss's face changed.`
`"Uh, o......oh...!`
` I got through, I got through...!`
` It's ringing...!"`
`"R‐really, Krauss‐san...?!"`
`"Yes, I see it now, the old man was shortsighted...!`
` It seems that he cut the external line in an effort to prevent us from contacting the police, but he missed out on severing the internal line...!"`
`"Internal line?`
` Krauss‐san, where did you call...?!"`
`"The guesthouse.`
` I'm calling the room where Jessica and the rest are staying...!"`
`"......Ah?!`
` Hello!`
` Hello?!`
` It's me...!`
` Who is this...?!`
` Gohda?!`
` Is Jessica there, is she safe...?!!"`
`"K‐Krauss‐sama......!!`
` I'm so glad you're safe...!!`
` Yes!`
` Milady Jessica and the other children are here as well, safe and unharmed...!"`
`"Dad!!`
` Is that you, Dad?!`
` I'm so glad you're okay......!!`
` Is Mom okay?!`
` Is she there?!"`
`".........M‐......"`
`Krauss choked on his words.`
`......Krauss had clearly seen Natsuhi's head crushed, had seen her killed right before his eyes......`
`Eventually, he was going to have to tell that to Jessica.`
`......However, Krauss began to fret over whether he should tell her this very moment, and lost his words.`
`......But even that was an answer under these circumstances......`
`"......I don't know about her......`
` ......Let's pray she's safe.`
` ...For now, I'm just glad you're safe."`
`"...........................Yeah.`
` ......I understand.`
` .........I'm sorry for......asking."`
`Jessica's voice was filled with tears...`
` ......There was no doubt for Krauss anymore.`
`{n}Jessica and the others had been told everything, start to finish, by Gohda and Kumasawa when they had met up at the guesthouse...`
`After they learned that six whole people had been killed,`
` Jessica and the others must have been in a frenzy about wanting to go to the dining hall.`
`.........Luckily he had been able to call before they stormed off towards the mansion.`
`{n}Krauss was relieved at his good timing during such tragedy...`
`"We have Kyrie‐san and Doctor Nanjo, as well as Shannon and Kanon here.`
` We're locked in a place that's like a dungeon, but don't worry.`
` We'll figure something out."`
`"Dungeon?`
` Where?!`
` We'll come save you...!!"`
`"Unfortunately, we haven't the slightest idea where this is either.`
` We think it might be under the dining hall, but that might not be true.`
` .........But anyway, Jessica.`
` You must not leave there.`
` You've heard from Gohda what happened?"`
`"Yeah......`
` ......Grandfather,`
` .........he...`
`......{nobr:{m:-5:——}—ed} everyone......"`
`"Grandfather isn't in a sane state of mind right now.`
` If you run into him, you'll be in danger.`
` You might be killed...!`
` You mustn't even think about trying to come and save us...!`
` We'll take care of ourselves."`
`"Th‐then what should we do?!`
` Grandfather, you piece of shit, how dare you do that to Mom and the rest......!`
` I'm gonna kill that worthless old bastard...!!"`
`"Jessica, if you talk like that, you'll sadden your mother.`
` A lady doesn't use those kinds of words."`
`"Uuuuughhu......uuuuuhughhu......!!"`
`"Anyway, you all put your own safety first.`
` Lock up the guesthouse.`
` ......But you mustn't get complacent.`
` The large window in the downstairs lounge might get broken."`
`"Stay in the room you're in, and use a bed to make a barricade.`
` There's a toilet and fridge in there too, right?`
` You should be able to stay holed up until tomorrow morning."`
`"......Alright, I'll say it again... Don't think of anything dangerous.`
` And definitely don't think about trying to take revenge for Mom!`
` Think only of hiding and making it through this, and don't provoke the enemy."`
`"Yeah......mm....!!`
` Okay, ......Dad......!`
` Uuuuhhughuuuu!!"`
`After that, Gohda took the phone,`
` and was told again to watch over the children as a responsible adult.`
`......Gohda repeatedly replied "Yes, sir!" in an overstrained voice, his face covered in cold sweat.`
`From there, Kyrie received the phone and spoke with Battler, and when Shannon and Kanon got their turn, George and Jessica answered.`
` And following that, Nanjo and Kumasawa picked up as well, so that all members of both sides had their turn on the phone,`
` each encouraging the other and confirming that they were at least safe for now, even if their location was unknown,`
` and coming to a complete understanding of the current situation for both sides.`
`They wanted to talk forever, but now was not the time to chat.`
`Krauss told them that they would be hanging up for now, and those in the guesthouse agreed.`
`"If anything else happens, we'll call.`
` Wait by the phone so you can pick it up quickly.`
` Again, be careful.`
` You mustn't do anything rash...!"`
`"Y‐......yeah, I understand......`
` Just knowing that you and......Kanon‐kun and the rest are safe, ......that's a win in my book......`
` ...We'll do our best.`
` Please stay safe...!"`
`"Yeah, of course.`
` Well then, I'm hanging up for now.`
` Be on your guard."`
`With that, the phone call ended.`
`Gohda and the rest of the men quickly descended the stairs, closed the shutters, and secured the strong locks on the doors.`
`However, just as Krauss had worried, there was nothing that could be done about the beautiful wide window in the downstairs lounge.`
`If this were to be broken, it would be easy for them to get inside.`
`It wouldn't be hard for someone like Kinzo, who hadn't hesitated at committing murder, to invade the first floor.`
`"......It's likely that Grandfather and his followers will be armed.`
` Locking ourselves in this room is our best bet, and moreover our only method of staying locked down.`
` ......It's painful that we have no choice but to stuff ourselves in a locked room, but if our enemies are carrying guns, then that's the only method we have left to us."`
`"Th‐the Master is said to have a collection of working guns.`
` .........That's right, guns, that was a gun...`
` If so, ......it's a horribly powerful gun...!`
` W‐we can't contend with that at all...!"`
`"............Smashing someone's head, that takes a hell of a lot of force, right?`
` It might be a magnum bullet, or something along those lines.`
` That might go through a flimsy door like it's nothing."`
`"If so, then that's even more of a reason to barricade ourselves in the room...`
` Let's put up a bed and block the window too.`
` ......If we do that much, then it doesn't matter how many guns they've got, they shouldn't be able to break in."`
`"Shit, ......is this passive, one‐sided defense all we can do?`
` ...Goddamn him, knocking off my dad, and even capturing Kyrie‐san...`
` ......You're gonna pay for this, you old goat...!"`
`"I‐i‐i‐impossible, there's no way we can go against them...!!`
` Besides, it's not just the Master, he has several underlings too!`
` Th‐there might even be more of them...!`
` .........Just what......are they......?"`
`Battler was filled to the brim with the urge to get revenge for Rudolf,`
` and to rush out of here to save Kyrie.`
`......But just by looking at how terrified Gohda was, there was no doubt in him that this would be reckless...`
`"......It's gotta be hard on you too, ......right, Aniki?`
` And yet we've gotta stay holed up here, ......goddammit......"`
`"Of course, I'm torn up about it too.`
` ......There's no way I could remain calm with both of my parents murdered."`
`"But specifically because of that, I {i:have} to remain calm!`
` Do you think that our murdered parents would want us to die in vain?`
` There's no way they would!`
` They'd want for at least the children to escape."`
`"That's why I'm going to survive.`
` And I will report this to the police, and uncover everything.`
` The courts will avenge my parents.`
` {i:That} will be my revenge.`
` ......There's no way our parents would want us to die taking revenge for them.`
` Right...?"`
`"...........................`
` ......You're right...`
` You're damn right...`
` ......That old bastard, fuck your stupid ritual...!`
` If you're saying we're gonna be sacrifices for that, then we'll run away just to spite you, and fuck up the whole goddamn thing......"`
`"That's the way.`
` ......Besides, you still have Kyrie‐san, Battler‐kun.`
` And I still have Shannon.`
` Let's just act cautiously and wait for our chance.`
` Carelessness on our part might even work against the others who are captured."`
`"......Hostages, ......huh.`
` .........But Grandfather captured them so he could use them as sacrifices, right?!`
` If we don't go and save them, then they're just waiting to be killed, aren't they?!"`
`"We don't even know where the dungeon they're being held in is...!`
` Neither did Shannon or Kanon‐kun, or of course Gohda‐san or Kumasawa‐san."`
`"The probability that they're in a secret location that only Grandfather knows of is incredibly high.`
` ...Under these circumstances, aimlessly wandering about is suicide!"`
`"......I, ......I know that...`
` .........But still......goddammit......are you saying the only thing we can do is stay confined here until something happens......?"`
`"Ba‐......Battler‐sama, I understand your feelings, but...`
`......let's put safety first...`
` ......From what Krauss‐sama said, they seem to be in a fairly old cell,`
` and they may be able to break the bars somehow.`
` ......The wise choice of action now is to believe in them and wait."`
`"Grandfather has a number of subordinates, and they're all armed, correct...?"`
`"Y‐......yes, that is correct.`
` .........And they're probably...`
`yes, all armed......"`
`Gohda had been able to say that Kinzo had others on his side,`
` ......but he had not been able to mention that they were mostly all young women, like witches, ......and committed their murders using strange magic.`
`If he had said that, it would only have caused the others to doubt his sanity.`
`...No, in fact, he himself still couldn't understand what he had seen, and was doubting his own sanity.`
`......But, regardless of sex or appearance, ......regardless of whether it was done with magic or a gun.`
`The fact that those girls had followed Kinzo's orders,`
` and killed six people in an instant...was an unshakable truth......`
`If those people came to attack the guesthouse as well, ......what would happen?`
`Just closing the doors and windows like this was surely meaningless......`
`Gohda, ......as well as Kumasawa.`
`The only thing left for those two, who had witnessed that massacre in the dining hall,`
` was to cradle their heads, not even knowing how to interpret what they had seen...`
`".........Kumasawa‐san, are you okay......?`
` Want some tea......?"`
`"H‐hohohohoho...`
` Thank you very much, yes, thank you...`
` ...I'm sorry, but may I be left with my thoughts for a little while.........?"`
`Maria tried to be nice, but it seemed that Kumasawa still wasn't able to clear away her confusion.`
`"......Maria, thanks for being considerate.`
` Let's let Kumasawa‐san rest for now."`
`"......Uu."`
`Jessica too showed consideration for Kumasawa, certain of the shock she must have received after witnessing such a tragedy,`
` ......but her imagination couldn't even come close to the impossible scene Kumasawa had witnessed...`
`Nevertheless, with her mother having been killed, and her father having been captured,`
` there was no way that Jessica could stay calm either.`
`She sealed her anxiety and sadness using her anger towards Kinzo, and walked irritatedly around the room.`
`"............Kumasawa‐san.`
` Is Mom really.........dead?"`
`"......Y‐yes......`
` ......I've never seen such a...horrible way to die before......"`
`"It's...not possible that she's still alive,`
` .........and with treatment, we could save her,`
` ......is it......?"`
`"...........................`
` ......A‐.........after such a thing happened to her head, it's unimaginable that she could still be.........alive......"`
`".................................`
` ......Well, yeah...`
` ......If the head gets smashed,`
` ......there's normally no need for treatment, is there......"`
`When Gohda had come flying into the guesthouse, overcome with agitation,`
` he had told about the massacre in the dining hall without concealing anything.`
`......Except for the part about the witches and magic, which they themselves still could not believe.`
`In other words, they hadn't even sugarcoated the cold‐blooded way in which Natsuhi and the others had died.`
`......It was too late now, but Kumasawa regretted having obviously said too much......`
`However, while lightly shaking her head and with a slightly painful laugh, Jessica spoke.`
`"......No, if anything, I was able to stay level‐headed thanks to what you told us."`
`".........If you'd avoided mentioning the part about her head being smashed,`
` ...maybe I'd have said that she could still be alive,`
` then ran off towards the mansion, straight into Grandfather, ......and I might have been killed."`
`"......There's a chance that sliver of hope would've been fatal.`
` .........With that in mind, I'm grateful."`
`"......I am deeply sorry.....`
` I apologize for not choosing my words carefully..."`
`"Don't worry about it now.`
` There's nothing we can do about Mom now......but Dad's still alive.`
` Kanon‐kun and Shannon, and Auntie Kyrie and Doctor Nanjo too."`
`"......I want to save them somehow, so we shouldn't do anything unnecessary that might be a burden to them.`
` ......The most helpful thing we can do right now might be to wait by the phone."`
`There could be a phone call asking them to create a diversion to facilitate their escape.`
`Or perhaps the others might learn their location, and call for rescue.`
`......Jessica understood that in order to act promptly when that time came, the only thing they could do for the time being was to wait in this room...`
`George, Battler, and Gohda returned, having finished checking all of the locks downstairs.`
`Each of the three was holding a bunch of different objects.`
`George had things like drinks, canned food, crackers, and other types of snacks that he had found in the lounge and pantry, as well as a first‐aid kit.`
`All consumables that would be indispensable while they were locked down.`
`Gohda had a large folding ladder and carpentry tools.`
`Those were so that, in the case of an emergency, they could nail over the door from the inside to seal it.`
`{n}If it came to that, the ladder was for escaping out the window.`
`Battler had brought up objects which could be used as weapons, such as blades and poles.`
`The kitchen knives went without saying; the disassembled table legs could be used as clubs;`
` and the pole roughly the size of a person, which had been made by taking apart a hat stand,`
` could surely be used as a spear, even though it had no point.`
`......There was a good possibility that the enemies were carrying guns, so it was dubious whether these would be of any use.`
`But it was still better than not having them, and if those things could provide at least a little peace of mind, then they could also expect some kind of calming effect from them.`
`Then, they placed beds and sofas from around the room up against the door, barricading it.`
`They didn't go so far as to seal it up with nails.`
` ......There was still the chance that Krauss and the others would escape, and come to meet up.`
`They had apparently set up a barricade at the top of the stairs as well.`
`{n}It had been designed to create a racket, so it would work in place of a warning alarm as well.`
`It was apparently Battler's idea.`
`For that reason, they turned the TV off.`
`{n}.........So that if the first‐floor window were to be broken, they would know by the sound.`
`Once the switch had been turned off, all that was left was an eerie silence.`
`......The sound of the violent wind and rain.`
` Were they going to have to spend the whole night in such crushing suspense?`
`The boat was meant to be coming tomorrow morning.`
`However, judging by the weather report, the typhoon was expected to continue all day tomorrow, and the boat probably wouldn't come.`
`......The typhoon would pass in the morning of the day after tomorrow.`
`In other words, the boat would be coming the morning of the day after tomorrow, ......as in, the morning of October 6th.`
`And right now, it was late at night, October 4th.`
`.........They would have to spend more than thirty hours on this island,`
` with Kinzo turned cold‐blooded murderer and his weird companions prowling about......`
`Even with the shutters closed, there would definitely be a little bit of light seeping out.`
`It might let the enemy know that they were hiding here.`
`......Battler suggested that it might be best to turn off the lights.`
`But they had already been taken over by such a ghastly feeling just from turning the TV off.`
`.......There wasn't anyone who directly challenged his proposal, but then again, there wasn't a single other person who agreed to it.........`
`"......Uu.`
` Can't watch TV?"`
`"Yeah, sorry, but you'll have to bear with it.`
` ......We can't afford to miss the sound of the enemy breaking in."`
`"........................`
` ......Boring."`
`Even though she had been told that her mother had died, Maria alone somehow didn't seem to feel an approaching sense of danger.`
`It seemed she was quite displeased with having the TV turned off.`
`.........Even with this bizarre situation in front of her, she can't share our sense of danger?`
`......Because she's so young?`
`To Battler right now, seeing that young girl act in a way that was even slightly out of place...`
`made him feel that there was something very eerie about Maria......`
`"All that said.`
` .........There's nothing more to try.`
` Do you think you'll be able to do anything about the bars?"`
`"......Unfortunately, they're tougher than I imagined.`
` I don't know when these were made, but their durability is certainly up to snuff.`
` These are truly made rather well."`
`Kyrie chuckled softly.`
`{n}......They had no moves they could make, but the mood had calmed just a little.`
`"......This place is just like where you place chess pieces once you've captured them.`
` ......There is nothing left we can do, then......?"`
`"Not so fast.`
` It's still too early to give in.`
` If we stop thinking, we might as well stop breathing, right?"`
`"Exactly.`
` ......Chess pieces taken aside may have no purpose, but there's a great purpose for them in shogi.`
` Just one captured pawn should be able to put pressure on the opponent."`
`"I see...`
` But still, there's nothing that can be done about these bars......"`
`"For us, maybe.`
` .........But, if we can pinpoint where this is and contact Gohda‐san, we might be able to get him to come and save us."`
`"I see...`
` But that would mean forcing danger on Gohda‐san......`
` And I would also be worried for the children in the guesthouse, without a full‐grown adult male..."`
`"If you're risk‐averse, biding your time until the situation improves again is not a bad idea.`
` ......However, if you don't know when to cut your losses, what you have might become worthless scraps of paper.`
` ......And what we have is our lives."`
`"Our dignity as parents, too, right?`
` After talking big like that during the telephone call, and telling them that we'd handle it and they should stay put, we can't just start asking for help right away.`
` That would be very uncool.`
` *giggle*."`
`"At this point, pride is already worth less than nothing.`
` .........Why don't we put our heads together?`
` Where is this?`
` Is it really underneath the dining hall?`
` Or else, is it a different place, separate from the mansion...?"`
`Krauss, Kyrie, and Nanjo began to discuss their plans.`
`Kanon was squatting by the bars, silently trying to sense anyone's presence.`
` ......Just as he had been ordered.`
`Shannon came close to him, and they both squatted down together.`
`"............Do you sense someone?"`
`".........Yes.`
` ......They aren't paying any attention in this direction, but there's somebody relatively close by."`
`"Is it {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}...?"`
`"............I think it's the goats.`
` Their breathing is really noisy."`
`Kanon's ability to sense the presence of others was several levels above that of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
`He described their breathing as noisy, but Krauss and the rest couldn't even pick up the slightest hint of it.`
`......Therefore, even if he had simply reported it, they would merely have doubted his ears.`
`"...............They got us, didn't they."`
`".....................`
` ......It's unusual.`
` For us to be captured without being killed."`
`"This time, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama didn't make her appearance.`
` And the Master left his study.`
` ......I don't have a clue what's going on..."`
`"I do.`
` .........Whatever happens or changes, it's all for that witch's fickle entertainment.`
` The result will be no different."`
`"I wonder if this time we'll be able to.........go to the Golden Land."`
`"Who knows.`
` We have a high rate of losing."`
`"............Come to think of it, it's a rare thing that both of us survived the first twilight, isn't it?`
` ......I get the feeling that it's incredibly unusual for us to be able to talk together like this even though the ritual has already begun."`
`"Maybe.`
` ......But that's still just for the witch's entertainment.`
` I'm not thinking of it as anything other than her letting us live just a little longer to ridicule us, since we usually drop out right in the beginning."`
`"I wonder if........we'll be unable to reach the Golden Land again."`
`"I'm sure we won't.`
` ......If we hold onto any foolish hope, we'll get taken advantage of again."`
`"*giggle*.`
` That's right.`
` Last time you got taken advantage of."`
`"......I'm an idiot."`
`Kanon made a sour look, and turned his head.`
`Shannon laughed softly, and apologetically leaned towards his shoulder.`
`"But......it's nice to hear that Milady is safe, isn't it?"`
`"......She's escaped the first twilight, that's all.`
` ......She might just be being made to wait for an even crueler death in a later twilight."`
`"What about you, Nee‐san?`
` ......Aren't you glad George‐sama's safe?`
` It'd be nice if you two could reach the Golden Land together."`
`".........Thanks.`
` I wish the same for you and Milady as well."`
`"I, I don't have my hopes up.`
` .........It's just as you say.`
` All that witch is doing is having fun dangling prizes in front of people, and watching them flounder."`
`".........I'm sure no one will be able to go to the Golden Land.`
` ......If I was foolish enough to wish to reach the Golden Land with Milady,`
` .........that witch would find that very fun to toy with, and would certainly never let us reach there."`
`"......You're right.`
` .........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is thinking about which order of sacrifices will be the most interesting."`
`"The whole thing about them being chosen at random is just a blatant lie.`
` That swindling witch...`
` ......All that about having any wish you want granted in the Golden Land is probably just a lie."`
`"..................That's not true.`
` The Golden Land is......a wonderful place."`
`"Have you been there?"`
`".........Only for a little bit.`
` Though, even that was probably just {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's joke."`
`"...............What's it like there?"`
`"Well.`
` .........It's a wonderful place.`
` ...I can't really explain it well.`
` It's a world like a pleasant dream."`
`"A paradise‐like place, with roses blooming all over and beautiful butterflies dancing, or something like that?"`
`"......It's not a place with a tangible image like that.`
` It really is like being in a dream.`
` When you're there, it's very gentle, very peaceful,`
` ......and you're allowed to sleep as long as you want, like when you wake up early on your day off, lying under the covers."`
`"......Sunlight comes in through the cracks in the curtains, and you think "I have to get up",`
` but then you realize it's your day off, and you can go back under the covers again...it's a place where you can feel like that."`
`"I'd feel annoyed that I got up at all.`
` Getting up by accident even though it's your day off is something only you would do, Nee‐san.`
` .........Go on?"`
`"Well.`
` While I was there, I felt very contented, and very calm.`
` But once you return to this world, you can't remember it well, even though you've only just been there."`
`"It's a lot like when you can't remember a dream you were just having.`
` ......But I still remember that it was a very calm and quiet world."`
`".........That's it?`
` Wow, that Golden Land she's always bragging about isn't much special at all.`
` ......I thought it was a place where all your wishes come true."`
`"It is.`
` It's a place where all your wishes will be granted.`
` .........Well, maybe that's not quite it.`
` It might be better to say it's a place where you don't have to wish for anything."`
`"......For example, if you were cold, Kanon‐kun, and wished you had a jacket, you'd be happy to be given one,`
` but if you were in a warm room to begin with, there wouldn't even be a reason to want a jacket, right?"`
`"......That's what the Golden Land is like.`
` There's no need to even wish for most wishes.`
` It's a world released from everything, where everything is calm."`
`"You could even say it's a place that transcends the concept that having your wishes granted will bring happiness...a world released from everything."`
`"........................`
` ......It sounds kind of religious."`
`"And there, everything is equal.`
` All things with minds are equal.`
` ......There are no {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, nor furniture, nor witches.`
` ......There, I was equal to everyone.`
` There was no longer any need to feel ashamed of myself because I was furniture."`
`".........It was honestly a happy world where I was equal to all {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, and even witches.`
` I can't really remember it well,`
` but I have the feeling that when I was there, I was equal even to {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, and we were good friends."`
`"............If that witch is there, then it's not a much of a paradise."`
`".........So, you want to go to that blissful Golden Land with George‐sama.`
` That's strange.`
` The Golden Land is a utopia where you want for nothing, right?`
` Wouldn't you be content even if George‐sama wasn't there?"`
`".....................`
` ...The Golden Land is very calm, peaceful, and everything is fair and equal.`
` ......But actually, happiness alone is left out."`
`"It isn't a happy world?"`
`"Of course, just by being peaceful, calm, and fair, it's an incredibly happy world.`
` ......But I guess you could say that it's a world of zero, where you're released from all negative worries."`
`"The human world is filled with negatives, so of course a zero world is incredibly happy, ......but it's still zero.`
` *giggle*, that's asking for a lot, isn't it?"`
`"......It's something like this.`
` When you're nodding off on your quiet holiday morning,`
` ......if the person you love the most is next to you, and they're holding your hand, then it can become an even greater, more wonderful happiness, .........something like that.`
` ...Sorry, Nee‐san is horrible with analogies, I'm too stupid."`
`"......So,`
` to you, the greatest happiness would be reaching that world together with George‐sama."`
`"Yes.`
` And I'm sure that for you, it would be reaching that world together with Milady."`
`"The two will be released from their worries in a fair world...?`
` .........It feels like I'm being indoctrinated into some kind of strange religion.`
` I imagined something more...worldly.`
` A world where we would be given magic medicine, and that would make us be born again as {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, or something more like that."`
`".........If you go, you'll understand.`
` If {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama really is a fickle person, then surely some day, she'll let you get a glimpse of it too.`
` ......Then you'll be able to understand my example."`
`"....................................`
` Well, I'm not holding my breath.`
` ......At any rate, it seems like game over for us this time already.`
` Maybe we can do better some other time."`
`"......You're right.`
` If we have some strange hope, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama will take advantage of us again.`
` .........It might be best for us just to stop thinking, and entrust ourselves to fate."`
`".........We just need to be simple chess pieces.`
` ......No matter what we think or don't think, we can't escape from the witch's chessboard.`
` Our role is now just to wait and see how we'll be tortured to death.`
` ......For us, the dream of the Golden Land is too unavailing."`
`"..................You're...right.`
` ......Sorry......"`
`Kanon shrugged his shoulders, then told Shannon to leave him alone because she was interfering with his duty, distancing himself from her.`
`Realizing her thoughtlessness in bringing up such an inappropriate topic and instead hurting Kanon,`
` Shannon bit her lower lip and stared at the ground...`
`She wouldn't bother him any more.`
`{n}She went off and squatted in a corner by herself.`
`".....................nn—"`
`At that moment, Kanon twitched.`
`{n}It was like the ears of a cat when it reacts to a faint sound.`
`"What's wrong?"`
`"......Shh.`
` .........Krauss‐sama, somebody is coming."`
`"What?!"`
`They ended their conversation and strained their ears.`
`......For a while, they couldn't hear anything,`
` but before long, they were able to hear the sounds of a large group of people walking...`
`"......So they've come."`
`"The time of reckoning is upon us—or else, our first and final chance."`
`".........I shall talk to Kinzo‐san.`
` ...I will try to find out where this place is somehow."`
`"We're counting on you.`
` ..........................."`
`During the last phone call, Kyrie had asked what the time over at the guesthouse was.`
`......It had been the same as her watch, and by this she had learned that their watches hadn't been set back.`
`It wasn't just the clocks on the walls in the guesthouse.`
`{n}Several people's watches, including George's and Gohda's, had matched.`
`......If that was the case,`
` then after the massacre in the dining hall, they had been transported to the dungeon in only a few minutes.`
`Not enough time had passed for them to be knocked out and carried away.`
`Then were those really pitfalls, meaning that this was the area directly under the dining hall......?`
`All they could do was pray that Nanjo could find out where this was...`
`"......They're coming.`
` There's probably...four people.`
` ......The Master, and three of those who appeared in the dining hall."`
`"OK, good.`
` You come back here as well now.`
` We'll deal with the rest."`
`"Shannon‐chan, sorry, but can I have you sit by the phone?`
` Hide it with your skirt."`
`"Ah......yes...!"`
`The presence came closer, ......and there was the sound of a heavy door being opened at the other end of the corridor.`
`The light they were apparently carrying illuminated the dimly lit corridor, stroking the walls with razor‐sharp shadows.`
`And then, the light from the lantern they held lit up the prisoners through the bars.`
`......The bars' sharp shadows divided them up lengthwise.`
`There were four figures there.`
` .........It was Kinzo, ............Ronove, {f:5:Virgilia}, and Gaap.`
`"The head of the Ushiromiya family, Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}.`
` Everyone, your silence, please."`
`"...............{f:5:Goldsmith}?"`
`"It's Father's pen name.`
` It seems he always signs with it when writing those bizarre grimoires."`
`"‘Kinzo’ made English‐style?`
` Shouldn't that be {f:5:Goldwarehouse}?"`
`".........Hahhahahahahahahahahaha.`
` A warehouse is a place to keep things in and nothing more.`
` Whereas I create gold, and use my craftsmanship to further increase its worth.`
` Don't you think "smith" is much more fitting?"`
`"...............Certainly.`
` I apologize for blathering."`
`"Kinzo‐san......`
` ......Just what is going on?`
` Where in the world is this...?"`
`"Oh, my friend.`
` Can't you remember?`
` Certainly, you may never have entered the prison, but you should remember walking through this corridor."`
`".........Huh,`
` ............huh?`
` ...............Y‐you don't mean........."`
`"......Do you have an idea?"`
`"But, no, .........that is inconceivable.`
` ......Firstly, we fell through a pitfall, and furthermore, we were locked up in here after only a few minutes...`
` ......Not only is the distance too great, that's physically impossible......"`
`"For a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, right?`
` *giggle*."`
`"Father... Is this the mansion?`
` To think that the mansion had an underground area like this......"`
`"Kraussss.`
` Wasn't there a place whose existence you all whispered of, and which you followed after me on numerous occasions trying to find?`
` .........This is that place.`
` No, to be correct, this is under that place.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"This place couldn't be............Kuwadorian's...`
`...basement...?!"`
`"......It is as you surmise.`
` This is the basement of Kuwadorian."`
`"Kuwadorian......`
` ......You don't mean...Father's rumored hidden mansion......?`
` It really exists......?"`
`"This mansion was constructed for the sole use of my beloved witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` It is truly a shame that I cannot show you around the above‐ground section, as it is such a beautiful and elegant mansion."`
`".........How lovely, just the two of you alone in a mansion with this kind of room.`
` It seems that you and I are differently inclined."`
`"......Kyrie‐san.`
` ......It would be wise to refrain from such rude comments."`
`"*giggle*.`
` But I agree.`
` ......If a mansion I was given had this kind of dungeon in it,`
` even a hundred‐year love would turn cold, and I'd take anything of value and run for the hills."`
`"Pu ku ku.`
` Oh? You have no interest in this sort of thing?`
` And here I was thinking that you would go head over heels."`
`"Heheh.`
` .........Of course I go head over heels.`
` If I get a collar or something for a birthday present.`
` ......But only if he's a stud."`
`"Puu ku ku ku ku!"`
`"Quiet!`
` ......Don't you need a gag more than a collar?"`
`"Oh, even that's not off‐limits for you?`
` You sure aren't picky, Lia.`
` *giggle*......"`
`"Wh‐who gave you permission to shorten my name...?!"`
`"Enough, you noisy women!`
` Are you telling me you'd like to be locked up in the same cell?"`
`"I, I apologize, my lord...`
` This old body of mine would not be able to stand such a cold prison..."`
`{f:5:Virgilia} quickly apologized, but Gaap merely laughed together with Ronove.`
`It was like she was saying that she wouldn't be captured,`
` or else, that even if she were to be captured, it would be meaningless......`
`"A prison is a place where the captured cannot escape from.`
` That implies the strong will and love to not let go for a lifetime.`
` A woman who you could give up on if she ran away is not worth the word "love"."`
`"A woman who makes you fall so madly in love that you don't want to let her escape, to the point of binding her in chains...`
` It is only upon reaching that level that it becomes a love worth sacrificing my life for.`
` .........I will not ask you to understand."`
`".........I cannot be bound by anyone, and will not be bound.`
` I don't want to be loved, I want to love.`
` I feel the same as you, {f:5:Goldsmith}.`
` That's why I understand the madness of your love."`
`"Love and madness are two sides of the same coin, or so they say.`
` How bothersome."`
`".........But learning where we are so easily was a big step.`
` We'll ask the details later, but it seems that you know about this place, right, Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"Y‐yes......`
` ......If that corridor is the underground passage beneath Kuwadorian,`
` .........then if we go straight there, it will become a long tunnel,`
` ......and if we stay on that, we should be able to return to the mansion."`
`"......Then if we could just do something about these bars, we could go home."`
`"Father...`
` What are you planning to do with us?"`
`"As I have already declared, you are the sacrifices for the later twilights.`
` There are conveniently five of you here.`
` You will be perfect as hostages for the five gougings."`
`"......I see.`
` ...Then it's the time of reckoning for us, then?"`
`"Eventually.`
` That's not why I'm here this time, so relax.`
` Besides, I believe I said it already.`
` ......If one of my grandchildren is deemed suitable to inherit everything from me, then the ritual will be called off.`
` In other words, your lives will be spared."`
`"......Wh‐what are you planning to do to the children?"`
`"To see if they are suitable to be my successor or not,`
` I shall give them a test.`
` If even one of them can impress me, I'll call the ritual off."`
`".........And if there isn't anyone suitable,`
` ......what are you planning on doing with the children?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` There's no need to worry about that.`
` After all, you are the ones who will be made into sacrifices first.`
` Anything after that should be of no concern to you."`
`"You simply need to place your fates in the hands of your own children.`
` ......Your children, the fruit of what you've birthed, taught and raised.`
` They should truly be the most suitable to entrust with your fate...!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Don't make such a worried face, Kraaauss...`
` Believe in the daughter that you brag is worth ten billion yen.`
` Hehheheh, heh{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!"`
`".........Exactly.`
` Children are the fruit of their parents.`
` Worthy of entrusting with the parent's fate.`
` And Father, that applies even to you."`
`"......Heheh, hahhahahaha!`
` This woman has guts, what a waste on Rudolf!`
` Wahhaha{0}hahaha...!!"`
`"...Kyrie‐san, ......it would be best not to aggravate him too much."`
`"I agree.`
` Let's bear with it for now......"`
`"That's right...`
` ......After all, we're simply fish on a chopping board.`
` There's nothing we can do now."`
`"Except insult me with such vigor.`
` I don't dislike that kind of woman, you know?`
` {f:5:Beatrice} was that kind of woman too, in the beginning.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"............My lord.`
` Let us get to the main topic.`
` We've been getting derailed for a while now."`
`"Ah yes, there was that. Sorry, sorry, my friend.`
` Well then, let's get to the main topic.`
` For that, I've prepared a phone.`
` .......Shannon, very shrewd of you.`
` You don't have to hide it any longer.`
` I had that put there.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"M‐my apologies......"`
`"........................"`
`Shannon quickly withdrew, and the telephone was revealed...`
`"Krauss.`
` Call the grandchildren in the guesthouse.`
` And tell them of the test—of the start of my trial."`
`With a gesture that seemed to be saying "go ahead", Ronove urged Krauss to pick up the receiver.`
`"...............And if I say no?"`
`"Hohoh, and why do you think you're in a position where you can make a deal?`
` If you don't call, then the grandchildren won't even be given a chance.`
` The Ushiromiya family will end here.`
` And I'll turn you all into sacrifices right away!!"`
`"You'd be lucky to become sacrifices right away.`
` ......Don't you think it'd be more painful to watch the children be made into sacrifices first, before your very eyes...?"`
`"......Ga...ap.`
` The Master is the one who decides the order of the sacrifices.`
` Keep your opinions to yourself."`
`"Lia, you just tried to shorten my name and failed, didn't you?"`
`"I, I did not!`
` And I told you not to shorten my name...!"`
`"......Women truly are..."`
`"Noisy. Pu ku ku!"`
