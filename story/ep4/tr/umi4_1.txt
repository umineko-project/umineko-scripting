`"Good morning, Milady.`
` My, my, you do appear to be in a good mood.`
` What a pleasant awakening you seem to have had."`
`"‘Pleasant awakening’...!`
` I was so excited, I couldn't sleep a wink.`
` After all, the curtain is rising on the oh‐so‐fun fourth game...!"`
`It seemed that she truly had been so excited that she hadn't gotten any sleep.`
`And yet she showed absolutely no signs of tiredness; was that due to her youth, or her low mental age?`
`Ronove chose not to say that aloud, and laughed with a {nobreak:"pu ku ku"} instead.`
`"I really ran that Battler into the ground last time!`
` Ah, that look of "you tricked meee" all over his face!`
` He looked so pathetic!`
` In any case, I do hope he's not still feeling down?"`
`"Feeling down, you say...?"`
`"Mm, well, how to put it.`
` ...You know how he is a bit too sincere for his age?"`
`"Indeed I do.`
` Although one could call that his charm.`
` Pu ku ku..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` You could, you certainly could!`
` Well, speaking of that.`
` You know how he completely fell for the thing I pulled the last time?"`
`"Oh, yes, completely and splendidly.`
` ...His pure, rosebud‐like innocence, arising from never once having been tricked by another since birth, you unreservedly violated."`
`"............Even the joy of running around a field covered with beautiful new snow on a winter morning and trampling it utterly wouldn't even begin to compare."`
`"You took Battler‐sama's innocent heart, Milady,`
` and thrillingly, splendidly, atrociously, mercilessly, and in quite the uncultured manner, enough to make one think "maybe I went a teensy little bit overboard...?",`
` you most assuredly perpetrated the very worst of atrocities against it."`
`"I am quite sure most people {i:would} start to feel down.`
` Pukkukukuku, so much so, that I doubt they would ever want to see your face again."`
`"S‐so you understand...!"`
`"I also, umm, considering that the fourth game is finally getting underway,`
` I thought that it would be such a pain if he was so disheartened that he wouldn't join us at the table,`
` and so, you see, I asked you first, thinking that it would be better to prepare a countermeasure beforehand...!"`
`"Hmmmm...`
` In that case, indeed, I do think you would be well served to prepare such a countermeasure.`
` Most unfortunately, due to your "North Wind and the Sun Strategy", it appears that Battler‐sama has received quite a shock."`
`"H‐hoh...`
` ......A shock, you say... How badly...?"`
`Beato lowered her voice slightly, asking timidly.`
`{n}Ronove went along with that, and lowered his voice in the same way.`
`"......In truth, he has been curled into a ball clutching his knees for some time now.`
` I called out to him several times, but he did not answer.`
` I also carried him something to eat, but he does not appear to have touched it."`
`"...Th‐that is...troublesome......`
` Is he really feeling that down......?"`
`"Pukkukukuku.`
` It is only natural.`
` ...After all, you`
` {nobreak:com‐`
`pre‐`
`hensively}`
` destroyed him, Milady.`
` That would turn most anyone into a misanthrope."`
`"Hoh, distrust of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s? How convenient!`
` Let him give up on {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s and trust witches, wahahaha...`
` ...............O‐...oh,`
` *cough*.`
` Sorry, I took it too far."`
`Beato had tried to joke about it, but it seemed that the situation was quite serious, and after picking up on this, she hid her laughter.`
`"......Is it really that serious...?`
` Sh‐should we wait just a little longer before beginning the fourth game...?"`
`"Because Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}'s guest will be coming,`
` it may be more appropriate to open the fourth game quickly.`
` However, it might be useful if you were to show him a little consideration, Milady."`
`"Consideration!`
` Consideration, you say?!`
` How should I show that...?!`
` He is feeling down, so,`
` ...h‐how about...I cheer him up, or something?!"`
`"When a person's heart is closed off to the light, it is useless to interact with them in a gloomy fashion.`
` You can do nothing but shine with a brightness stronger than the dark."`
`"Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiit, quit messing arooooooooouund...!!!"`
`"Kyaahhahaha!!`
` Battler‐kuun, over he~re!`
` A croissant baked by Ronove‐sama would be wasted on the likes of youuuu!`
` Maybe I'll enjoy it aaalll myself?"`
`Battler's stomach involuntarily growled at the fragrant smell of the croissant.`
`His breakfast plate was empty, but he hadn't eaten any of it.`
`{n}...The biggest glutton of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory,`
` Beelzebub, had waited for Ronove to leave, and had then come to snatch the food away.`
`Battler had discovered her in the process, and they had been charging about causing a crazy amount of noise ever since.`
`Even though Beelzebub could have ended it by either giving it back already or else throwing it into her own mouth,`
` she intentionally ran around in circles, making fun of Battler.`
`"Give me my breakfast back, damn iiiiiiit!!`
` If you give it back now, I'll let you off with a single flick to the forehead.`
` But just you try eating it!!"`
`"What, are you gonna eat me inste~ad?!`
` Kyaha!`
` Try it if you think you can! I'll bet I'd be as sweet as honey pancakes.`
` ...kya!"`
`"Gotcha!!`
` Right now, I'm more interested in that bread than your thighs.`
` Be a good girl and give it heeeeeeeeere,`
` fugagigigigi...!!`
` So, you resist until the eeeeeeeeeend...!!"`
`"Ugugugugu!!`
` No way, no way, I won't give it to yo~u!!`
` Even the croissant wants me to eat i~~t!!!"`
`"Y‐yaa~y, yoo‐hooooooooo, g'moooooorning, Battleeee~r!!`
` Get a load of this guy, first thing in the morning and he's back to moping already~?!?!`
` It's the beginning of a new day, and a new game, you know, so get your spirits up and let's get this party starte{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeddd!!"`
`...The door opened forcefully.`
`Like a marathon runner drawn on a {c:86EF9C:certain caramel box},`
` with her hands held high and with an idiotic cheeriness,`
` ......Beato appeared.`
`For some reason, countless country flags and confetti scattered everywhere, creating what was clearly intended to be the perfect party atmosphere.`
`......Battler and Beelzebub, who had been grappling on the floor over the croissant, completely forgot about their argument and stared at her speechless.`
`"Kya‐...kyahahahaha!`
` Good morning, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama!`
` Well, that's all for me!`
` Here, Battler‐kun, say aa~h!"`
`"Mggmffff!!"`
`"Mmmffmmmff, *munch*munch*, ...*gulp*.`
` .....................`
` ......H‐hey, morning, Beato...`
` ......Glad to see you're in perfect form this morning."`
`....................................`
`Beato and Battler looked at each other.`
`{n}...It seemed that neither had a clue what was going on with the other.`
`"B‐......Battlerr......?`
` Wh‐wh‐what is this, Ronoveeeee,`
` he looks like he's in high spiriiiiiiits!!`
` He isn't clutching his knees!`
` And he's answering!`
` {i:And} he was even in the middle of eating!!"`
`"Pukkukukukuku!!`
` No, no, he certainly was clutching his knees, under the blanket as he slept like a baby.`
` I informed him that it was time for him to wake up, but he just wouldn't get out of bed.`
` As for his food, it seems that he was rather too preoccupied with the naughty cat that had wandered in.`
` Pu ku ku, puu ku ku ku ku!"`
`"G‐`
`.........gwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!!`
` You tricked meeeeeeeeeee...!!"`
`"Heh, you should talk.`
` Weren't you the one who played that massive trick on me last time?`
` I don't have a clue what's going on, but I'm glad to see you started your morning with a helping of just deserts.`
` ...Well, anyway, nice one, Ronove."`
`"Pukkukuku, I am much obliged, Battler‐sama."`
`The two stuck up their thumbs as though they had forged some kind of male bond, chuckling together.`
`For a while, Beato acted very energetically, trying to hide her embarrassment......`
`"Heh.`
` Don't take me so lightly.`
` You thought I'd still be hiding in a corner, holding my knees?"`
`"*cackle*.`
` Then who was that person crying their eyes out in frustration last time?`
` I should've collected your copious tears in a bottle and used it as eau de toilette."`
`"Sh‐shut up.`
` That was, uh, you got me a bit with your crappy acting and crazy plot twist, that's all.`
` I made an ass of myself, but you'd better not think that same move is ever gonna work again."`
`"Naturally.`
` Don't disappoint me by falling for the same move over and over again, alright?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Ihihi, yeah, just you watch.`
` I'll teach you that I'm a guy who gets stronger every time he's beaten down."`
`"............But Beato."`
`"Mm, what is it?"`
`"Never do it again."`
`"Hoh?`
` And why is thaaat?`
` So you really are weak against the rear attack?"`
`"............You and I are enemies,`
` and we'll never, ever join forces.`
` ...I now understand that clearly.`
` ......So never again do something as unpleasant as trying to make me confused about that fact."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` You say that, but now that I know it's your weak point, ........."`
`Beato thought they were still joking around, ...but that had disappeared from Battler's expression some time ago.`
`Beato felt as though his eyes were like the surface of black tea gone cold...`
`"You hear me?`
` Never do it again."`
`"..................`
` ......You never know...`
` I might do it again when you've forgotten..."`
`"Never do it again."`
`"............nn, ..............."`
`Pierced by his strong and forceful gaze, Beato held her tongue.`
`She may have thought that Battler would surely be the one to break that silence with laughter.`
`...However, Battler's serious expression didn't change in the slightest.`
`So, to break that silence, Beato had no choice but to start laughing herself.`
`"*cackle*cackle*, hahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!`
` As things should be.`
` You and I are worthy adversaries.`
` No matter how favorable our relationship, we shall never cross that line defining us as enemies.`
` If you have not mistaken this, that is enough for me."`
`"...That's right.`
` I almost forgot that you were my enemy for just a second.`
` I won't show such a disgraceful display again.`
` ......I won't fall for your rear attack again.`
` Ever...!"`
`"...........................`
` ...Heh!`
` Hahhahahyahhahha!!`
` It seems that I am not the only one who cannot wait for the fourth game.`
` I am pleased, Battler.`
` Come, take your seat."`
`"...Sure.`
` Bring it on.`
` ......Clever little tricks aren't gonna work anymore."`
`"Stop acting so tough.`
` You remain in a state of surrender for the last mystery in the previous game, the mystery of Nanjo's murder...!"`
`".........I'm still holding off on an answer for that one.`
` But that doesn't mean I've lost heart.`
` I will break your "red truth" and deny witches—I guarantee it...!"`
`"Hmph.`
` A good disposition.`
` You truly are a man like a phoenix.`
` You don't betray my expectations!`
` With that, let us raise the curtains on the fourth game."`
`"But before that,`
` it seems that we must welcome a new guest."`
`"A guest......"`
`"I am sure you must remember.`
` That mystery woman, who appeared at the very end of the last game without an invitation and spoiled my performance."`
`"......Her........."`
`"She says that she wants to join our game, you see.`
` I took the liberty of sending her an official invitation to join us.`
` Ronove, call the guest."`
`"......There's no need.`
` I'm already here."`
`The voice that answered Beato's call came from the darkness in a corner of the room.`
`Battler turned around in surprise to discover that the mysterious woman was suddenly there.`
`"Goodness gracious.`
` How rude.`
` If you were here, the least I would have expected is a simple greeting."`
`"I don't make a habit of greeting people before punching them.`
` But I will give one after I punch."`
`"Hoh, and what will that be?"`
`"<Good night,`
` have a nice dream>."`
`"*cackle*cackle*, hahhahhahahahahahaha!`
` Entertaining, truly entertaining...!"`
`Beato cackled and clapped her hands.`
`But that was only Beato, and nothing rose to Battler's face except an uncertain smile.`
`"......Whew.`
` So you're the "punch first, ask questions later" type, huh."`
`".............................."`
`Battler met eyes with the woman, shrugging his shoulders as he spoke.`
`{n}But the woman didn't answer, giving only a cold stare in return.`
`"......You helped me out last game when things were really coming down to the wire.`
` I'm grateful."`
`"I don't need gratitude.`
` The way you were acting was just {i:flaccid}.`
` I only told you to get a clue."`
`"Kuhhyahhyahhya!`
` Yesss, Battler is flaccid indeed, hyahhyahha!"`
`Beato tried to laugh in agreement, but the woman wasn't listening.`
`She did absolutely nothing except stare at Battler with ice‐cold eyes.`
`"...............Well, it looks like someone hates me."`
`"I'm just annoyed that you aren't fighting seriously."`
`"You say I'm not serious......?"`
`"You can't possibly mean that the mess you got yourself into earlier was you being {i:serious}?`
` ......What do you take me for?`
` How long do you intend to go along with this witch's farce?"`
`"...I am fighting Beato in my own way.`
` And yes, I'm serious about it."`
`"Serious?`
` .........Don't make me laugh.`
` You keep on drinking tea and chatting with a witch for all eternity and call that fighting seriously?`
` Keep the jokes to just your hairstyle."`
`"......I mean, sure, I wasn't used to this witch's game in the beginning, and I've had a hell of a rough time, I'll admit.`
` But now, I'm finally starting to see how to fight and the knack to doing it.`
` ...If the pathetic way I've been acting makes it look to you like I haven't been serious, you're mistaken."`
`".........Am I?"`
`"Of course, I know I've gotta close in a lot more before I can grab Beato by the collar."`
`"But no matter how long that distance is, it is finite.`
` And with each passing game, I am steadily closing that distance step by step!"`
`"No matter how long it takes, I will close in on that witch, and I'll definitely checkmate her.`
` ......Borrowing one of her common phrases, it might even take me "a thousand years".`
` ...But even so, eventually, I will definitely win."`
`"Why?`
` Because I will never accept losing.`
` I will never stand still, and I'll keep closing in on her!`
` So in other words, there's just one thing I can say for sure."`
`"......I will definitely win against that witch someday!`
` That's how it is."`
`"You sure are patient.`
` Are you even trying to win?`
` Even the finite can become infinite if it's treated the wrong way.`
` You've already become Achilles, unable to even outstrip a tortoise."`
`".........Now I get it. So this is why I'm needed.`
` At this rate, there's no way you could win against the Endless Witch even after a billion years."`
`"......Who are you?`
` It wouldn't kill you to tell me your name."`
`"................................."`
`At that point, the woman fell silent, gazing straight into Battler's eyes.`
`At first, Battler faltered under the firmness of that look and his gaze wavered slightly, but as her eyes continued to stare into his, gradually, he found himself becoming lost in them.`
`......And in their depths, he saw a light that he had seen at some time before...`
`Battler was struck by how strongly they resembled the eyes of a girl who definitely couldn't be here,`
` ......but that was completely impossible.`
`"...I know it's stupid,`
` ......but for some reason, I'm getting that feeling.`
` But that can't be right.`
` ......She's supposed to still be six years old.`
` ............You couldn't possibly be...`
`.........Ange, could you............?"`
`"........................`
` If I said yes, ...would you believe me?"`
`"Nn..............."`
`"I'll put it another way.`
` If I said "I am on your side, so trust me",`
` would you believe me?`
` Would you unconditionally trust some unknown woman you're meeting for the first time just because she looks a little like someone you know?"`
`"......It's because you're so trusting that you were tricked so easily in the last game and cried so bitterly."`
`"......You said it yourself.`
` That kid is six, right?`
` Do I look like I'm six?`
` And despite that, if I were to claim that I'm that kid, you'd still just swallow that story?"`
`"......When you put it like that,`
` ...I guess you're right."`
`"...Sorry.`
` Yeah, I am too trusting.`
` The last game should have taught me that.`
` ......Is this what you meant when you said I wasn't serious?"`
`"Yes.`
` You may think you're fighting against the witch, but all you're doing is making friends with her and having fun.`
` ......You're just competing in a friendly game of chess."`
`"That may be a serious contest for you two,`
` but looking at it from far away, I only see you two playing around like you're good friends, protected by the rules."`
`".....................`
` ......Ihihihi.`
` That's harsh."`
`"But as long as you can't win this game, you won't be released from this place.`
` ......That's why I came.`
` To bring this game to its conclusion.`
` ......You claim that you're closing in on the witch, but you're just like a hamster running around in a wheel."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Oh, those? Those things that run around and around in a wheel night after night?"`
`"At a glance, you might think that running around in a wheel is endless.`
` ......Endless Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` You are just like that wheel.`
` And he is the one running around in the wheel forever, thinking he's fighting, but actually just making a fool of himself."`
`"......This isn't a game.`
` This is nothing more than a cage to keep him imprisoned for all eternity."`
`"Hoh.`
` ......You would liken my infinity to a mere wheel that a mouse plays in?`
` Interesting, interesting, *cackle*..."`
`"Something that's infinite in a certain dimension tends not to be infinite in a higher one.`
` A Menger sponge may have infinite surface area, but that only applies in a world of less than three dimensions.`
` In the three‐dimensional world of reality, it has zero mass.`
` Not only is it not infinite, it can't even exist."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!`
` What an assertive woman.`
` It seems you are worthy of calling yourself my enemy."`
`"............Who...are you?"`
`"I am your ally.`
` And an enemy of witches.`
` .........Of course, you don't have to believe it."`
`"No one can prove that I really am your ally.`
` In fact, it would be preferable if you stayed on your guard strongly enough to find me very suspicious."`
`".........You're right.`
` I got burned bad the last time.`
` I've got to be at least that careful.`
` ...I'm done with getting tricked."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*......!"`
`Beato laughed with true satisfaction in a way that was insulting only to Battler.`
`"People don't just get tricked out of the blue.`
` They neglect to check things for themselves, and entrust that to other people—and that's when they get tricked.`
` ......Saying that you thought the light had turned green just because you saw other people start crossing is no excuse for getting into an accident.`
` Get it...?"`
`"Yeah... I get it.`
` ......You're telling me not to swallow information given to me by others, but to think for myself.`
` .........I've just been swallowing the magic that Beato showed me."`
`"{i:I'd stopped thinking}.`
` That's why it was no good."`
`Battler grimaced as he remembered his many painful losses.`
` ...Seeing that, the witch laughed audaciously once again.`
`"I will advise you in a way that will be to your advantage.`
` Of course, you shouldn't just swallow the things I say.`
` Because no one can provide absolute proof that I'm on your side."`
`In the last game, {f:5:Virgilia}, who I'd thought was an ally, turned out to be on the witch's side after all.`
`......Battler couldn't get that eerie smile worn by {f:5:Virgilia}, who he had even thought of as dependable, out of his head.`
`"So you don't have to unconditionally trust me.`
` Therefore, taking my advice as nothing more than an opinion to be considered is absolutely fine.`
` After all, ......the player who's fighting in a game against the witch {i:is you}."`
`"...Yeah, you're right.`
` Saying I lost because I followed the moves of an outsider would be just too pathetic of an excuse."`
`"Indeed it would!`
` My opponent is Battler.`
` You are nothing more than an outsider.`
` It is good that you understand that.`
` *cackle*!"`
`"No, I'm not an outsider.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}, Ushiromiya Battler,`
` ...and me with my bird's‐eye perspective over you...will fight in a formation almost like a triangle.`
` At a glance it might not seem to be a united front, but fighting together is not the only way to form a united front."`
`"Hoh.`
` What an odd thing to say."`
`"Just now, he described fighting with you as closing the distance.`
` But you can't measure distance with a single eye.`
` Only with two eyes are things visible in three dimensions, and only then can distance be measured."`
`"......And having two viewpoints is meaningless if they're in the same place.`
` You can gauge the witch more accurately if they're far apart."`
`"......Shooting from different positions and different angles.`
` ...So, like crossfire, then.`
` Heheh, interesting."`
`"We will shoot from different positions...and different angles.`
` ......So I won't make friends with anybody.`
` In order to separate my own position and catch the witch in a pincer attack."`
`".........Are you sure about this, Battlerr?`
` This woman may actually be an ambush I set up, you know?`
` She might just be saying something plausible to gain your trust, you know...?"`
`"......Maybe.`
` She's been saying that over and over again herself.`
` ...So, of course, I can't blindly accept her advice."`
`"But I can think for myself and decide whether it's worthy of being trusted or not.`
` As long as I don't stop thinking for myself, I won't be tricked by anyone again...!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` Impressive confidence, Ushiromiya Battleerr!`
` After you've said so much, it makes me want to...`
`trick you all over again, you see...?`
` And I want to see what kind of face you'll make when you realize that you've been tricked yet again!`
` I like it, kuhha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"......So, it looks like you know my name, but I don't know yours.`
` ...Tell me your name."`
`For a while, the woman remained silent without the slightest change in her expression.`
`...She looked as though she couldn't decide whether to say her name or not, or possibly, as though she was deciding what to call herself on the spot.`
`"......Gretel."`
`"Girdle?`
` You wear one?"`
`"That's my name, dumbass.`
` Call me Gretel."`
`"Then should I call myself Hansel?`
` Ihihihi, just kidding, I'm Ushiromiya Battler!`
` Just call me Battler."`
`"............Nice to meet you.`
` ...I hate handshakes.`
` Don't take it personally."`
`"...Yeah, you're right, sorry.`
` I mean, it isn't a sure thing that you're on my side.`
` ......And you only just told me to keep my guard up, too."`
`Battler drew back the right hand he had stuck out.`
`His bitter smile disappeared, and was replaced with a strong expression of resolve for the new game, now in its fourth iteration.`
`"Battler.`
` ......Think deeply about why you must win against this witch.`
` ......You can't stop with something abstract, like "She annoys me so she's going down".`
` ......Have a deep conviction that you'll definitely defeat the witch and escape from this world."`
`".........Because there is definitely...`
`......someone waiting for you to come back.`
` ......For her sake as well, you...`
`..........................."`
`Maybe she had something on her mind.`
` Gretel clenched a fist in front of her chest and hung her head in silence, at a loss for words for a short while.`
`Beato spoke up in a forceful voice, shattering that silence.`
`"Good, that should be enough of an introduction for Gretel or whoever!`
` Come, try to remember, what happened on October 4th!`
` Kuhhihihihihihihi, the curtain opens on the fourth game!!"`
`In unison with her voice, the clock, which had been turned back to October 4th, 1986, ......started to move, as though blown by a suddenly raging storm.`
`While we remained in the witch's tea room, the blue‐gray sea and the green Rokkenjima spread out beneath us,`
` ......and we could see the boat heading there, trailing a wake behind it.`
`The sky was already cloudy, and it seemed that the barrier of the typhoon would soon shut the island away.`
`The boat docked in the harbor,`
` .........and Gohda, who had been waiting there, could be seen helping to unload it.`
`And finally,`
` ......the boat dropped off all of the passengers,`
` .........and began to separate from the island.`
`The relatives started to get swallowed up by the island.`
`"Ahhahahaha!`
` You're as energetic as ever, Maria."`
`"Maria‐chan, you'll trip if you don't look out.`
` Be careful...!"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Gonna faaall gonna faaall, gonna siiink gonna siiink, *giggle*!"`
`...All my fondly remembered cousins I had loved so much dashed away through the beach,`
` ......disappearing as they were sucked into the forest path leading to the mansion.`
`And of course, Onii‐chan could be seen among them too.`
`"......Dammii~it!!`
` Hold it, hold it, Mariaaaa!!`
` You nimble little brat!"`
`"*giggle*! Uu‐uu‐uu!`
` *giggle*giggle*!"`
`Maria onee‐chan, who I had loved, dashed away, and Onii‐chan chased after her.`
`They were swallowed up by the forest.`
`Following in pursuit, Mom and Dad were also swallowed up.`
`The rest of my relatives were swallowed up, too...`
`......Swallowed up, leaving only me behind...`
`You idiot......`
`How long are you going to joke around and play with a witch in a place like this......`
`Come back quickly, ......Onii‐chan......!`
`Don't leave me all alone...!`
`And realize.`
`Realize what a cruel and lonely world I end up isolated in...`
