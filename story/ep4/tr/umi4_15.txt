`".........A test......?"`
`"......M‐mm.`
` Listen well..."`
`Once again, there was a call from Krauss to the guesthouse.`
`......And the message was......that Kinzo wanted to hold a test to see if the grandchildren had the qualifications to be the next head.`
`".........The head has said that his successor will not be one of us siblings,`
` that he wants to......pick from you grandchildren..."`
`From Krauss's restrained style of speech, Jessica realized as his daughter that he was being forced to speak.`
`And she was forced into the realization that the hostages were being exposed to danger even now,`
` and that if they refused this test, there was a possibility that the hostages would be harmed.`
`"S‐......so......`
`what should we do?"`
`"......M‐...mm.`
` Hold on..."`
`Krauss held the receiver away from his ear, then looked at the grinning Kinzo on the other side of the bars.`
`Kinzo gave his next order.`
`"Before the test, those unrelated must be removed.`
` .........Gohda and Kumasawa are there, I believe?`
` It will be a problem if they interfere with the test.`
` Banish them from the guesthouse."`
`".........Banish, ...you say......?"`
`"There should be a gardening storehouse in the rose garden.`
` Lock Gohda and Kumasawa in there.`
` Hmm, we'll begin from there.`
` Tell them to do it immediately."`
`".........My weapons will be watching.`
` Should they do anything questionable, I'll instantly stop the test and execute all of you as sacrifices!"`
`"......I, ......I understand......`
` ......Hello, Jessica...`
` Listen closely to what I'm going to tell you......"`
`Krauss relayed to Jessica the orders to lock up Gohda and Kumasawa......`
`"......What kind of test are you planning?"`
`"Hmm?`
` Aah, it truly is a simple test.`
` I will simply have my grandchildren show me their resolve.`
` Well now, I wonder what kind of results they'll show me.`
` ......Hehehahahah."`
`With displeasure, Kyrie watched Krauss, who was talking with the children...`
`......It's regrettable, but for now we can't refuse orders.`
`In this dungeon, a feeble resistance won't amount to anything.`
`If we provoke him too much and drive him into a position where he might kill us,`
` there will no longer be any way to stop this murderer.`
`......For now, the only choice left is to obey his rules without agitating him,`
` all the while waiting for a chance......`
`However, if we continue to obediently follow his commands,`
` the children might be attacked in this so‐called test, and they might even lose their lives.`
`.........Whether we feign obedience or try to resist, ......nothing will cause the situation to improve.`
`Anyway, keeping our eyes peeled so that we don't let a single chance escape until the very end...is the only resistance possible now.`
`......While telling herself this, Kyrie watched over Krauss as he delivered Kinzo's orders......`
`".........Kyrie‐san.`
` Let us be patient......"`
`"I know.`
` ......It's unfortunate, but all we can do right now is wait.`
` If we can just do something about these bars, we'll be able to get back to the mansion......"`
`"......If only we could somehow get out of here...`
` ......I‐I'll try something.`
` ...............Kinzo‐san, I have a request."`
`"Hm, what is it, my friend?"`
`"We understand well that you want to test the children...`
` ......It is fine for you to do things as you desire."`
`"Without your power, the Ushiromiya family might have collapsed long ago.`
` We truly understand why you want to carefully select the person who will take charge.`
` Besides, that is what the family conference is about.`
` We won't get in your way..."`
`"Hmm.`
` I am glad to have your understanding.`
` That's right, this is the family conference.`
` The final family conference, where I will select and finalize the next head.`
` Fuhaha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!"`
`"So, the thing is, Kinzo‐san...`
` ......It is far too cold here.`
` We won't interfere with your test, so couldn't you take us to a slightly warmer place......?"`
`".................."`
`At Nanjo's words, the slight signs that Kinzo's mood had been improving were blown away.`
`A moment of silence struck Nanjo as Kinzo glared at him with dangerous eyes, as though evaluating him......`
`"......Certainly, this place is cold.`
` It's tough on an old body.`
` ......My lord.`
` Wouldn't it be alright if we moved them upstairs......?"`
`"That is not happening!!`
` I don't think so, Nanjoooooo...`
` I know how truly elegantly you lay the foundations for future moves as you appear to give me a turn's breathing room.`
` I'm not falling for that, ohhhhhh noooo...`
` If you insist you're freezing, then I will line the floor with red‐hot coals!!"`
`"M‐my apologies......"`
`{f:5:Virgilia} had tried to help out too, but in the end, Kinzo was having none of it...`
`"...............You two sure are obedient.`
` ...If you felt like it, you could easily break these bars."`
`"..........................."`
`"......Even if we break these, nothing will come of it."`
`"True.`
` ......If you were to break these, it would mean the end of {f:5:Goldsmith}'s game.`
` ......All of you, as well as those humans in the guesthouse, would immediately become sacrifices for Kinzo's ritual."`
`"......But, you know, you two might be the only ones.`
` Who hold the power to break through this situation......right?"`
`".........You want to reach the Golden Land, don't you?`
` You must have many dreams you want granted, right...?`
` *chuckle*......"`
`".............................."`
`"Gaap.`
` You mustn't provoke them.`
` ......This is not your game.`
` It is the Master's game, and Milady's."`
`".........What is it, Ronove?"`
`"Oh, no, nothing.`
` ......We were chatting with the prisoners.`
` Forgive us."`
`Gaap sent one final sneering smile at Kanon, then turned away.`
`Kanon could only bite his lower lip and shake his fists......`
`".....................`
` ......Dammit........."`
`"......Well done......`
` Good job holding it in......"`
`"We're powerless......`
` Because we're furniture......"`
`"That's right, ......we're powerless.`
` ......But there are times when furniture is needed, and even loved."`
`"......We're stored away in the basement right now, that's all.`
` ......I'm sure that one day, somebody will love us.`
` Need us.`
` ......So, for now, let's ignore their provocations and bear with it...`
` ......Okay?"`
`"......Father.`
` I've ordered them to lock up Gohda and Kumasawa in the storehouse."`
`"Good.`
` You may hang up now.`
` ......Chiester Sisters.`
` Observe the grandchildren as they lock Gohda and Kumasawa away.`
` If they do anything suspicious, ......then in that moment, the selection test for my successor will be over."`
`When Kinzo made his order, the Chiester Sisters appeared behind him in a line.`
`"Understood, sir.`
` ......I will scout.`
` {ruby:Five‐five‐six:556} and 410, cover both flanks.`
` 45, wide‐area surveillance."`
`"00...`
` 556 is......"`
`"Ah, ............that's right.`
` Sorry."`
`"She was a good kid......"`
`"......That's why I don't like them nyeh.`
` ...Good people."`
`"What are you doing, Chiester Sisters?!`
` Carry out my orders!"`
`"...............My apologies, sir.`
` Then, let us go observe.`
` ......Move out!"`
`The Chiester Sisters erased their forms simultaneously.`
`Nanjo and Kyrie witnessed the instants they appeared and disappeared as if by teleportation,`
` but they interpreted this as if they had probably moved in and out of the darkness in a way that only looked like teleportation,`
` and the two could do nothing but rub their eyes...`
`"......Well then.`
` I shall begin preparing for the test.`
` Ronove, Gaap.`
` I'm asking you to be the examiners.`
` {f:5:Virgilia}, you watch these rats.`
` .........After all, two of my furniture are here.`
` Just in case, be on your guard."`
`He glanced sharply at Shannon and Kanon.`
` Tightly closing her eyes, Shannon gave a silent bow, answering wordlessly that she would not cause any trouble......`
`"......Certainly.`
` I'll be careful."`
`"Isn't this cold hard on your old body, Lia?`
` Should I bring you a hot water bottle...?"`
`"Shut up.`
` Hurry up and go.`
` Gap."`
`"Pu ku ku ku...!`
` Well, well, tests and examiners, what a strange experience we have this game.`
` .........I do hope this development entertains Milady."`
`"......Come, arise, goat attendants."`
`{f:5:Virgilia} called out into the dark, and from that spot, three massive goat‐headed attendants slowly melted into vision.`
`"Ah, Riiche's minions.`
` How useful.`
` And they look so warm.`
` I see, so this is instead of a hot water bottle.`
` In that case, wouldn't sheep have been better than goats?"`
`"Shut up about it, you cashmere mop.`
` ......They aren't very bright, but they faithfully follow orders and are quite dependable."`
`"Mm, I leave it to you.`
` My friend, {f:5:Virgilia}.`
` ......The rest of you, follow me."`
`Kinzo turned with a grand swish of his cloak.`
`Following him were Ronove and Gaap,`
` ......as well as the three recently summoned goat attendants.`
`"......You three are supposed to wait here with me.`
` Don't follow them."`
`The goats jumped in surprise and then came plodding back.`
`Kyrie, who had been watching in disbelief as all of this played out, couldn't help but snort.`
`"Heheh......`
` What entertaining underlings."`
`"L‐Lord {f:5:Goldsmith} did not give you permission to speak freely."`
`...She was probably a little embarrassed.`
`{f:5:Virgilia} had spoken coldly, but Kyrie could see right through that, and for a little while, she couldn't restrain her muffled laughter.`
`However, on the inside, Kyrie was surprised at the number of people Kinzo had with him.`
`Because, including Kinzo himself, at least ten enemies had already been spotted...`
`......The dungeon they were currently locked in was supposedly underneath the hidden mansion called Kuwadorian.`
`Although this mansion's existence had been whispered of, not even Krauss had known it for a fact until today.`
`Were there actually several facilities like this on Rokkenjima, unknown to all but Kinzo,`
` hiding untold numbers of henchmen that only Kinzo knew of...?`
`Just how many humans are on Rokkenjima, locked away by the typhoon...?`
`No, actually...`
`Are we the only ones under the impression that there are only 18 people on this island......?`
`As we bickered over whether {f:5:Beatrice} existed or not, and racked our brains over something as minor as a 19th person,`
` were we on this island the perfect example of frogs in a well...?`
`No, wait, in fact...`
` At this point, are there actually more people on the enemy's side than on ours...?`
`"............Just what the hell is going on......`
` Witches? Demons? Magic?`
` ......Am I supposed to believe in those?`
` Are my eyes screwed up? Or is my head?`
` ...I think I'm losing it........."`
`A mass murder by magic.`
`{n}Demons forming and disappearing in thin air.`
`More importantly than the enemy's numbers,`
` how should we interpret the various things thrust before our eyes that cannot be explained with the common sense of this world?`
`......Kyrie started to feel like she didn't know what was going on anymore,`
` and while desperately battling the urge to abandon everything and give up, she clenched her teeth in an attempt to hold onto her sanity...`
`Obviously, Gohda and Kumasawa were quite unwilling to be locked in the rose garden shed.`
`......But they had been threatened that, if they resisted, the hostages' safety could not be guaranteed...`
`It was fairly hard to get them to agree,`
` but once the idea was raised that their safety might actually be guaranteed if the key to the gardening storehouse was to be handed to them through a cracked‐open window after they were shut inside,`
` ......and it was suggested that blankets and food could be carried in for them, they were finally convinced.`
`".........This place is pretty chilly...`
` I wonder how long we'll have to stay locked in here......"`
`"......In the worst case, it'll be until Monday morning, so a full day and night.`
` ......I really feel bad about doing this to you two..."`
`George and Battler cleared a space on the floor, then spread the blankets there.`
`{n}They also left the canned food, crackers, and other light snacks they had brought.`
`"It'll be hard for you guys to go until Monday morning with just this...`
` If only we could have stopped by the kitchen..."`
`"We were told not to go to any unnecessary places.`
` ......They do apparently have us under surveillance, after all.`
` .........Dammit."`
`"......I am honestly sorry that we cannot be of any use......`
` And these are the times that we are truly supposed to be at your sides........."`
`"It can't be helped.`
` ......More importantly, we're trusting you to take care of Kumasawa‐san.`
` ...We don't know what's going to happen.`
` When it comes down to it, I want you to do what you can to help her.`
` And more than anything, I want you to be safe..."`
`"...Yes, I understand.`
` ......Please, be careful, everyone.`
` Right now, the Master is......taking human lives like they're pieces on a chessboard.`
` ...Please be careful."`
`Gohda stared at the floor, remembering that atrocity in the dining hall, even now unable to believe what had happened,`
` and he hung his head in shame at his inability to fully describe that terror.`
`"Thank you.`
` .........Please make sure you stay on your guard.`
` You too, Kumasawa‐san."`
`"......And you all please take care as well......`
` I don't have any idea what's going on anymore......"`
`"Well then, ......we'll be off.`
` Let's go, Battler‐kun. Jessica‐chan.`
` ......Come on, Maria‐chan, you too."`
`"............Uu."`
`Looking at the painful expression on the faces of the pair to be imprisoned, it became hard to close the shutter.`
`But we can't disobey.`
`{n}......We're being watched.`
`We brought the shutter down and locked it.`
`{n}Then George headed to the small window on the side of the storehouse.`
`It was a small latticed window which could only be used for light and ventilation.`
`It looked like something from a jail, making the two of them seem even more pitiable,`
` ......but on the other hand, it would protect them from Kinzo and his subordinates, or so one would hope...`
`He opened the window and called out.`
`"......Are you alright? You're not cold, are you?"`
`"We're alright.`
` We've been given all these blankets, after all.`
` ......If we wrap ourselves up, we'll be just fine."`
`"I wish we could have brought them a kerosene stove or something......"`
`"......But it wouldn't have ventilation here.`
` It's tough, but there's nothing we can do now.`
` ......Hostages are being held against us.`
` We can't disobey..."`
`".........Dammit...`
` ......If we could just save Kyrie‐san and the rest somehow......"`
`"Shh.`
` ......They might be able to hear you.`
` .........Gohda‐san, here.`
` The key to the shutter."`
`George threw the key in through the tiny window.`
`"......Thank you.`
` I'll hold on to it."`
`Gohda took the key, and after showing it to Kumasawa, placed it in his own pocket.`
`There was only one key to the gardening shed's shutter.`
`{n}That was being held by those who were locked up inside it.`
`If the children had held onto it, then if it was stolen from them by some chance, that would risk exposing the lives of those in the shed to danger.`
`And even with the key, the shutter could not be opened from the inside.`
` It satisfied Kinzo's demand.`
`However, there was now no longer any way to open the shed from the outside either.`
` This would protect them.`
`Kinzo had ordered that they be confined, ......and we could do nothing but trust that this cold locked room would protect them.`
`Holding Maria's hand, Jessica watched George hand over the key, then looked over the thickets in the pitch‐black rose garden.`
`......Somewhere in this darkness, somebody was hiding, watching to see whether they obeyed orders or not.`
`Of course, merely pointing their flashlights out there did nothing to make any suspicious silhouettes appear.`
`But somebody was surely out there...hiding and watching.`
`They were hit many times with an urge to scream at them.`
`{n}......But they held that back through reason.`
`The four children left the area behind, repeatedly looking back over their shoulders.`
`The feeble light from the lightbulb in the gardening storehouse was seeping out slightly.`
`......Was it at all possible that this insane incident would somehow come to an end, ......so that they could see those two again?`
`......To George, who had closed the shutter himself,`
` ...the resistance of the lock made it feel as though he had killed them with his own hands.`
`".........But even so......we can't disobey......"`
`"A {i:test}...?`
` ......What the hell, old man......!`
` Killing Mom, capturing Dad for that......`
` I don't get it, I'll kill him...!"`
`"......It's alright, Jessica onee‐chan.`
` There's nothing to be sad about......"`
`".........Maria......"`
`"The witch will be revived very soon.`
` .........It won't be long before you can see her in the Golden Land.`
` ...Kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi............`
` Ouch."`
`"Don't laugh at inappropriate times.`
` ......Seriously, a resurrection ritual for a witch?`
` He should just keep his fantasies to the inside of his head.`
` Getting all these people involved...`
` ........That's gonna cost you, ...bastard..."`
`".........Let's return to the guesthouse.`
` ...It'll be bad if we aren't there when Grandfather calls."`
`Urged on by George, everyone began walking towards the guesthouse......`
`At that moment, Jessica spun around, and roared towards the darkness of the rose garden.`
`"..................HEY!!`
` Someone's watching, right?!`
` Tell the old man...!!`
` Tell him I'm gonna friggin' kill him!!`
` Let's go...!!"`
`Of course, there was no reply, only the howl of the wind and rain......`
`The children returned to the guesthouse...`
`{n}...In fear of what would be waiting for them when they got back.`
`After they departed,`
` .........from the exact point in the darkness that Jessica had yelled at,`
` two rabbit ears sprung up...`
`"......S‐sorsorsorryyyy...!`
` They found me ouuuut...!!"`
`"It's 'cause you're too slow, 45, nye~h.`
` Ni~hihihi~, Pendragon‐sama's going to scold youu~{p:0:♪}"`
`"I'm sorry I'm sorry, please don't tell Pendragon‐sama on meeeee!"`
`"Shut up be quiet.`
` It was obviously just a bluff.`
` ...Gohda and Kumasawa's imprisonment confirmed.`
` Mission accomplished.`
` Time to report back."`
`"Neener‐neener.`
` Nihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!`
` Ouch."`
`"Do you want us all stuck on nothing but carrots and water because of collective responsibility?`
` ......Let's go."`
`It certainly seemed to be a fact that they were being watched.`
`Because once they returned to the cousins' room, turned the lights on, and lay down on their beds, the phone rang again.`
`Up until now, Jessica had been answering the phone, seeing as it was her house,`
` but now it was George, as the eldest, who picked it up.`
`This time, Kyrie‐san was on the other end of the phone.`
`{n}George handed it to Battler out of consideration...`
`".........Hello.`
` Kyrie‐san?`
` Is everything alright over there...?!"`
`"Thanks for worrying.`
` ...It's agreeable for now.`
` .....................Sorry, I've been ordered to refrain from speaking freely.`
` Listen closely to what I'm about to tell you."`
`The fact that they were hostages still hadn't changed.`
`{n}And Kinzo or one of his subordinates was probably listening to this conversation.`
`Battler restrained the urge to talk about other things, and focused on what Kyrie had to say.`
`"The tests will be given to Jessica‐chan, George‐kun, Battler‐kun,`
` and Maria‐chan, in that order.`
` .........You'll be called out in turn, so until then, do not leave the room.`
` The person who is called out will head to their designated location, alone."`
`Battler repeated it out loud so that his cousins would also understand.`
`"......Jessica, Aniki, me, and Maria in that order, stay in the room until we're called, right.`
` ......Got it...`
` ......Maria too?`
` Even a nine year old girl... What's that old fart going to force her to do, goddammit..."`
`"...............The future of the Ushiromiya family rests in all of your hands.`
` ......Do your best."`
`"......Hm.`
` ...............Sure."`
`Battler noticed the strange nuance in Kyrie's words.`
`{n}Even without any blood connection, he could still understand thanks to the long‐lasting bond they shared.`
`Now was not the time to worry about the future of the Ushiromiya family.`
`{n}......That wasn't the message that Kyrie wanted to send.`
`She probably meant "there is no way for us to escape from this dungeon, and we can only wait to be rescued.`
` Our lives are in your hands".`
`......Something like that.`
`"Yeah, leave it to us.`
` No idea what kind of test it is, but bring it on.`
` I'm not backing down from that challenge.`
` .........It's a serious test, right?`
` ...It's OK for us to...`
`...go all out?"`
`"......Yes.`
` It's a serious test.`
` He plans to {i:seriously} test you all."`
`"That's no good, no goddamn good at all.`
` ......Some old fart on death's door thinks he can take me when I'm serious?"`
`"Let's see him spew that shit from beyond the grave.`
` He's there, so tell him this for me:`
` The next head is me.`
` And my first action will be to implant my fist into your face...!"`
`Even without Kyrie having to repeat it, Battler's powerful declaration of war reached Kinzo's ears...`
`"Fuhahahahahahahaha!!`
` Battleeeeer, I will truly be looking forward to it!"`
`"I can't wait to see just what a man who once discarded the Ushiromiya name has attained,`
` to just what state of mind he has ascended as he stands before me!!`
` Tell him that...!"`
`Unfortunately, Kinzo's voice was not picked up by the receiver.`
` So Kyrie spoke for him.`
`"He says he's more than up for the challenge.`
` .....Alright, Battler‐kun.`
` There's no need to hold back.`
` .........You are Rudolf‐san's son."`
`"......No, you are my son.`
` Show me something I won't be embarrassed to brag about.`
` .........I entrust everything to you......"`
`"Roger that, Mom.`
` .........Leave the rest to us...!"`
`".........All of us here have lost the right to inherit the position of head.`
` ......Now we're just the same as pieces taken off the chessboard, looking on from the outside.`
` So you'll have to fight by yourselves."`
`"...............Kyrie‐san........."`
`The nuance of those words was.........`
`"We've already given up.`
` ...You can forget about us."`
`......But.........for that very reason, I won't give up......`
`{n}I'm going to wreck this test or whatever, and save everyone...!`
`"Well then, ......here are the instructions for the first test, Jessica‐chan's.`
` ......Head to your own room, he says."`
`"Own room?"`
`"It seems he means Jessica's personal room in the mansion."`
`".........I'll hand it over to Jessica.`
` Tell her directly.`
` ......Jessica."`
`"He‐hello......`
` ............Okay, ...I understand..."`
`"............Me first, huh...`
` ......I'm ready.`
` Be right back!"`
`In actuality, Jessica was probably feeling the fear of a girl her age.`
`......But she buried those feelings and strengthened her resolve.`
`"Be careful, ......okay?"`
`"......We're being watched, right?`
` We can't do anything.`
` All we can do is exactly as we're told."`
`".........They say that old geezer killed those six in the dining hall in an instant, with no hesitation.`
` ......It might be the same for us."`
`"I get it.`
` ............I'll pay him back."`
`"Don't do anything reckless.`
` .........If you think you're in any danger, you put yourself first.`
` ......If Uncle Krauss finds out that his daughter sacrificed herself for him,`
` there's no doubt it would tear his heart apart."`
`"It goes the other way too.`
` .........If Mom and Dad were both killed, and I was the only one left,`
` my heart would rip itself to pieces."`
`"..............................`
` ......Battler‐kun.`
` Is what you said earlier true......?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Kyrie‐san and the others are already......prepared for what will happen."`
`"Then I'm even more sure I'm ready.`
` ......Their lives rest on our shoulders.`
` The hostages can't do anything while locked up.`
` So it's up to us to do something about it."`
`".........If anything happens, run back to the guesthouse.`
` At that time, we'll be done playing along with Grandfather's game."`
`"Aniki........."`
`"At that time, we will declare war.`
` .........Wherever they're locked up, we'll save them, and we'll see that Grandfather gets what he deserves."`
`"......Are you sure, Aniki?`
` ......Shannon‐chan's there too."`
`"........................`
` ......That doesn't mean I'll sit around and wait for my fiancée to be killed.`
` .........What scares me is not that Shannon might be killed by Grandfather."`
`"{i:I'm just worried you guys will be first to find that doddering old bastard who gave my fiancée a taste of terror, and literally beat me to the punch}."`
`"Now I get it...`
` ......Yeah, this really is a test to settle who the next head's gonna be."`
`"Yep.`
` ......The first one to bury a fist into that old geezer's face is the successor."`
`George, Battler, and Jessica each forcefully nodded their heads and put their fists together.`
`Then Jessica headed off to her own room, as designated......`
`Her form disappeared into the darkness of the rose garden, which was shaking in the violent winds.`
`......As they saw her off, George and Battler hardened their trembling fists.....`
`Jessica's back was watched through the window by Maria, who had remained upstairs.`
`Her expression was blank......`
`"......I wonder why everyone is getting so upset.`
` .........When {f:5:Beatrice} is revived, we can get her to bring everyone back to life."`
`Jessica's form had already been completely swallowed up by the darkness.`
`......At that time, the phone began to ring again.`
`Battler and George heard it and came clamoring back, but Maria picked up the receiver right away.`
`"...............Hello."`
`"M‐......Maria‐sama...?`
` It's Shannon.`
` ......Would you please hand the phone to George‐sama?"`
`This time, it was Shannon on the phone.`
`And the purpose of the message was to tell the next person, George, where he was to go......`
