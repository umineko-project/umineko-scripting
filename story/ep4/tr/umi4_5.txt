`The door was forcefully flung open, and Rosa flew in with Maria.`
`"Is Genji‐san or anyone here...?!`
` It doesn't matter who, someone bring us a bath towel...!!"`
`It was already a full‐blown typhoon outside, and it was starting to pour down hard.`
`{n}Though she had at least been using an umbrella, Maria had been in the rose garden amid all that wind and rain the whole time.`
`She had grown ice‐cold.`
`Maria had gotten into a minor fight with Rosa in the rose garden, and had been told to stay there forever.`
`......She had done as she was told, and had continued to remain in that spot even after the rain started.`
`Rosa certainly had gotten a little emotional and angry,`
` but Maria's stubborn demands were probably more at fault.`
`......The cousins, who had unfortunately been witness to that exchange,`
` were relieved to see the mother and child close to each other again.`
`Rosa towelled Maria's head dry.`
` She seemed overcome with worry that Maria might catch a cold, but Maria herself was nonchalant.`
`"Are you alright?`
` You didn't catch a chill, did you?`
` Maybe we really should go back quickly and get a change of clothes..."`
`"Uu, I'm fiiiine!`
` And I'm hungry, so food is better than change of clothes, uu!"`
`"Hahahaha.`
` She seems fine, Auntie Rosa.`
` She's gotta be alright if she's got that much bounce."`
`"It's a really good thing she had an umbrella.`
` ......I was thinking she might be soaked to the bone.`
` The fact that she was holding on to an umbrella is one consolation, at least."`
`"But Maria!`
` Even if you've got an umbrella, you have to get some shelter if it starts pelting down like this, got it?`
` Little girls shouldn't ever let themselves get cold."`
`".........Uu."`
`"It's alright, Jessica‐chan.`
` ......It's Mama's fault for telling her to stay there.`
` I'm really sorry, I'm really sorry...!!"`
`"Uu!`
` I'm a good girl?`
` Good girl for doing what Mama said?`
` Stayed there even though it was cold, stayed there until Mama came!`
` Uu‐uu!"`
`"Yes, you really are a good girl, Maria.`
` You did exactly what Mama told you...`
` You really did well.`
` But next time, even if Mama tells you to do something, you find some shelter if it starts raining like that.`
` Alright...?`
` Promise Mama."`
`"Uu.`
` Promise Mama.`
` ......Uu{p:0:☆}"`
`As Rosa gently held Maria, they joined their pinkies together and promised.`
`Battler and the others could tell that by this bonding between mother and child, expressed through a single little finger,`
` the warmth was starting to return to Maria's body.`
`"Kanon‐kun, thanks for the towel.`
` That really helped."`
`"......Then, if you would excuse me."`
`Kanon bowed with a blank expression, as though he had done nothing that required gratitude, then left the parlor.`
`"......Alright, it's already dinnertime.`
` Let's all go together.`
` ......Maria, you can even have half of my dessert too for being so good."`
`"Uu!`
` Really, Mama?!`
` Uu‐uu, get dessert, uu‐uu‐uu{p:0:♪}`
` Love you Mama, love you Mama!"`
`"Now now, Maria, don't jump around.`
` Mama loves you too, Maria.`
` Love you Maria, love you Maria."`
`"Me too, love you Mama, love you Mama!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu{p:0:♪}"`
`Rosa and Maria looked really happy together.`
` Even the cousins watching started to feel a somehow familiar warmth filling up their chests.`
`"......You know, that might be the age when you're on the best terms with your parents."`
`"It wasn't like that for me.`
` Like Mom and stuff, always yelling at me to study, study, study."`
`"That's because they love their children.`
` A parent's love isn't always gentle and indulgent.`
` My mother was strict with me too, but by now I realize that it was because she treasured me so."`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!`
` Love you Mama, love you Mama!"`
`"Love you Maria, love you Maria{p:0:♪} So, shall we get some food?`
` Let's be friends and hold hands."`
`"Uu!`
` Be friends and hold hands!`
` Mama and Maria, friendly friendly{p:0:♪}"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` Mama and Maria are friends.`
` Forever and ever.`
` I love you, Maria..."`
`"...............The hell was that?`
` ...What happened?"`
`The sudden sound had come from the teacup Gretel had been holding, which had fallen and smashed.`
`".........Sorry.`
` I was out of it for a moment.`
` Sorry for dropping it."`
`The cup on the floor was broken into tiny pieces.`
`......Would it really have made such a sound and smashed into so many pieces just by being dropped from that height?`
`Even someone as obtuse as Battler could realize that she was in a bad mood over something,`
` but he couldn't understand why she had suddenly grown so displeased.`
`When she made to bend over and pick up the pieces of the cup, Ronove appeared out of nowhere and stopped her.`
`"Please, you will injure yourself.`
` Leave the cleaning‐up to me.`
` Shall I bring you another cup...?"`
`"......No thanks.`
` .........I guess a demon's black tea just doesn't suit my tastes."`
`"Hoh.`
` To think that there is someone whose tastes aren't satisfied even by Ronove's tea.`
` I must respect your discerning palate."`
`".........I'm getting bored, so I'll go out for a bit."`
`"{i:Bored}?`
` Wait a sec, but things are just about to get started.`
` At this point, Maria's probably going to say that she got an umbrella and a letter from {f:5:Beatrice} again, you know?`
` This is the critical part—"`
`"You'll have to excuse me.`
` Sorry, someone clean up this mess."`
`"Leave it to me."`
`Without saying anything else, Gretel disappeared of her own accord.`
` Her form literally melted and disappeared into thin air...`
`There had definitely been a displeased expression on her face.`
`But neither Battler nor Ronove, nor of course Beato either, could understand why her mood had so suddenly worsened.`
`All that remained was the fragrance of the black tea she had spilled...`
`.........It felt very unpleasant.`
`No, to be even more blunt, it made my skin crawl.`
`"Uu...?`
` ......Why are you so irritated, Ange......?"`
`"{i:Why}?!`
` Isn't it obvious...?"`
`"Uu.`
` ...Not to me......"`
`Even Maria onee‐chan, with that blank expression on her face, ...irritated me.`
`I held my hands palms‐up in the empty air, and from out of nowhere, a single book landed upon them with a thump.`
`.........It was Maria onee‐chan's diary.`
`Even though there was no wind, the pages flipped and flipped without me turning them,`
` and opened the door to Maria onee‐chan's world.`
`"......Why do you think that I'm not happy, Ange?"`
`"............By thinking about it objectively."`
`"Objectively from your perspective, right?"`
`".....................`
` ......Are you trying to say that the truth is different for me and you?"`
`"Truth changes its form depending on the observer.`
` And observers from the future always overwrite that form.`
` .........Ange, what do you want with my happiness...?"`
`".............................."`
`The pages of the diary were flipped through at greater and greater speeds...`
`{n}Then a brilliant light poured out from the depths of the diary, ......swallowing everything up and painting over it all with white.`
`".........Sorry, Maria.`
` Mama has a mountain of work that needs to be urgently taken care of, so I'm going to be confined to my workplace for a while.`
` ......I probably won't be able to come back home until late at night the day after tomorrow."`
`"......Uu.`
` ......Then, what about the promise to go to the movies together on Sunday......?"`
`"The movies...?`
` Uhh—"`
`Judging by Rosa's tone, she had clearly forgotten that promise.`
`But Maria's response to that was an apology for asking...`
`............I'm sorry.`
`Maria apologized for troubling her mother by asking that question......`
`".........I'll stay home.`
` I'll behave myself and wait.`
` ......I'll take a bath every day and change my underwear."`
`"...I know where the money is.`
` ......I'll go to a different store every day.`
` I'll make sure not to go out too late.`
` If a policeman asks, I'll say I'm running errands for Mama.`
` ......I'll say it just like you told me to."`
`"...........................`
` ......That's right.`
` You be a good girl.`
` If you're good, I'll buy you a present.`
` Listen now.`
` Go to bed by nine o'clock.`
` Make sure not to tell your teacher or any grown‐ups that Mama hasn't come home.`
` Alright......?"`
`"..................'kay.`
` ......I will, so, Mama, work hard, okay?`
` ......Work hard, finish your work......and come back as fast as you can..."`
`"I......won't cry during the night and annoy the neighbors anymore......`
` ......So, come back soon........."`
`"..................`
` ......Well then, I'm busy, so I'll hang up now.`
` ...Be a good girl and wait patiently.`
` Don't do anything foolish.`
` See you."`
`Click.`
` ......Using a tone that indicated she was wrapping up the call, Rosa hung up the phone without waiting for Maria's answer.`
`Maria neatly set down the receiver and returned to the sofa.`
`{n}There sat the stuffed animal Sakutaro, who had been watching TV with her until a second ago.`
`Sakutaro was clutching the remote control to the TV.`
`{n}......She had turned off the TV temporarily because of the phone call.`
`He looked like he was asking her to turn the power on again because he wanted to quickly get back to watching TV.`
`"...............Sakutaro.`
` ......Did you want to watch...TV?"`
`‘......Uryu?`
` You don't want to watch anymore, Maria...?`
` If the entertainers' team gets all the questions right, they might turn everything around.`
` Uryu~!’`
`".........No.`
` .........That's enough...TV."`
`Again, ......Mama's busy with her work and isn't coming home.`
`Mama usually has a lot of overtime and doesn't come home until late.`
`......She has to socialize or something for work, so she comes home having drunk a lot of alcohol, even though she can't handle it,`
` and with a pale face, she goes straight into the shower and then to bed.`
`And even on the weekends, she says she has overtime or has to stay over, and almost never comes home.`
`......This has been happening often recently, saying she has a big job lined up or something...`
`......The picture I did my best on during art class got laughed at by everyone,`
` but I wanted Mama to look at it properly at least...but once again, I won't be able to show her.`
`And talk about the time when everyone pushed the cleanup onto me, but I did my best by myself and got praised by the teacher.`
`And talk about when I went shopping, and the man at the shop said he's always impressed by me and gave me a free can of coffee.`
`And there's the card I wrote and secretly hid under Mama's pillow,`
` because I wanted to encourage her when she comes home from working so hard.`
`"...............And there's more, there's...so much......I wanted to talk about."`
`‘.........Mama is working really hard at her job.`
` She's working with all of her strength so we can eat every day.’`
`"......Hate jobs.`
` ......Mama should just quit that stupid job."`
`‘A job is an important thing for adults to do.`
` ......It lets you eat food,`
` buys clothes,`
` pays for school lunches,`
` and pays the deposit for summer camp.`
` ......It's all because Mama works and earns money for you.’`
`"..............................`
` ...Don't need food.`
` Don't need clothes.`
` Don't need school lunches and don't want to go to summer camp.`
` ...It's not like any of the groups will let me join in."`
`‘Uryu......`
` ......Just now, on the phone, Mama promised that she'll buy you a present for when she comes back from work, right?’`
`‘I think Mama made that promise because you're important to her, Maria,`
` and she feels bad for making you lonely.’`
`".........I don't know."`
`‘Uryu!`
` She definitely wouldn't do that if she thought you were a pain or annoying!`
` ......She wants to stay by your side all the time as well.’`
`‘...She also finds it painful and sad that she can't.`
` ............I remember when Mama spent the whole night by your side, crying.’`
`".........Yeah.`
` ...Didn't understand why Mama was crying, ......but seeing Mama like that was so sad,`
` ...and I couldn't do anything but stay silent by her side."`
`‘I remember the last thing Mama said then.`
` ......She said thank you.`
` .........She said that just by being by her side, you were her only ally in the whole world.`
` ......Uryu, do you remember?’`
`"Yeah...`
` .........You're my only ally in the whole wide world,`
` ......she said."`
`Sakutaro set the remote on the table, crawled up onto the sofa,`
` sat on my lap, ...and spoke to me while gazing into my eyes.`
`‘......I'm sure Mama's just like you, Maria.`
` .........Where the designs Mama draws are the only ones laughed at by the clients.`
` ......And her company is the only one that has annoying jobs pushed onto it by other companies.’`
`‘Mama is the president, so she has to take care of everything all by herself.`
` ......And her company is the only one that never gets to join in with the business of other companies.’`
`‘.........You're Mama's only ally, remember.`
` ......If even you tell Mama to quit her job, ......in the whole wide world, where would Mama's ally be.........?’`
`"...............uu...`
` .........Sakutaro......"`
`‘The only person I have in the whole world is you.`
` ......And the only person Mama has in the whole world is you.`
` .........What about you, Maria?’`
`"......I have Mama...and I have you..."`
`‘Then you aren't lonely, at all!`
` Uryu!’`
`".........Uu."`
`‘Mama is busy with her work, so she can't be with you very often, but please, don't blame her for that, Maria.`
` ......In exchange, I'll always be by your side, and I'll be there forever and ever. ...............So don't cry, okay...?’`
`‘.........Uryu...`
` Me being with you.........can't stop you feeling sad......?’`
`"............uuu, ......uuuuuuuuuuu, Sakutaro...`
` ......uuuuuuuuu!!`
` UwaaAAaaAaahhh, waaAAahaaaAAahaaahhh..."`
`.........From the holes in Maria's heart, which she had been doing her best to seal up, ...drops of sadness finally dripped down.`
` ......Drip, drip.`
` Plop, plop.`
`......Sniff, sniff, drip, drip, plop, plop.`
`Even though weekends where Mama doesn't come home aren't that rare a thing.`
`......Even though this night wasn't especially more painful or sad than any other.`
`......Maria's tears poured down.`
`‘Uryuu...!`
` Don't cry, Maria...`
` I'll always be with you...`
` Even if you're going to cry, I won't.`
` I'm a lion cub, I can't cry just because I'm lonely.`
` ......I want to cry too...but I'm {i:not going to}...!’`
`"Why won't you cry, Sakutaro...?`
` You still won't cry, even when it's this lonely and you can't hold back the tears...?"`
`‘Uryu.`
` But if I cry, who will make you feel better...?`
` So I'm not going to cry.`
` Because I want to make you smile.’`
`"If I smile, ......will Mama come back......?"`
`‘When she does come back and you greet her with a happy face, ......I'm sure she'll feel the same.`
` Uryu.’`
`"......Mama...will be happy......?"`
`‘Uryu.`
` And then, I'm sure, it'll relieve her tiredness from work as well.`
` And then, I'm sure, she'll get in a good mood earlier than normal, and play with you a lot.’`
`".............................."`
`‘When you come home and Mama's waiting for you there, and she's in the kitchen in a good mood, don't you feel really happy?`
` It's definitely the same for her.’`
`"......If I stay here, being happy......she'll be happy too?"`
`‘Uryu!’`
`Sakutaro nodded deeply with his big head.`
`{n}No more tears could fall from Maria's eyes.`
`......Because if she greeted her mama with a tear‐stained face, her mama would probably get sad too.`
`‘You know this already, Maria.`
` You can't use the magic that creates smiles if you aren't smiling too.’`
`"......Yeah.`
` ......I know.`
` So I won't cry anymore."`
`‘Hey, Maria.`
` I have an idea for how we can have a fun time.`
` ......Uryu, can I tell you?’`
`"......What is it?"`
`‘Mama won't be coming back until late night Sunday.`
` Why don't we have a pajama party in secret, without Mama ever knowing?’`
`"Pajama party...?"`
`‘Until you get tired late tonight, you can play with me while eating candy and drinking soda in bed.’`
`"A pajama party.`
` ......Yeah, that sounds fun.`
` ...I don't have to go to bed at nine?`
` Mama won't get mad at me for not going to bed?"`
`‘This is a secret between you and me, only for when Mama isn't around.`
` So, until you get sleepy, let's spend the whole night having fun together.’`
`‘Let's eat jellybeans and try to guess what color we'll get next.`
` Let's split open peanuts and try to guess {c:86EF9C:which half is the grandpa}.’`
`‘Let's search for treasure in the closet.`
` And more, so much more!`
` I wonder what it'll taste like if we mix orange juice and melon soda.’`
`"Uu.`
` Wanted to try that once, but asked Mama if it was alright and she got mad."`
`‘Uryuu!`
` Let's try it out in secret from Mama{p:0:♪}`
` Tonight, let's play a lot, laugh a lot, and blow away our tears with happiness.`
` Don't worry, with me here, it'll definitely be fun!`
` I'll make you happy for sure, Maria.’`
`"Yeah... Yeah.`
` I know it'll be fun with you here.`
` It'll definitely make me happy.`
` Thanks, Sakutaro.`
` Won't cry anymore.`
` Let's have a super fun time together, make ourselves super happy, and say welcome home with a smile on our faces when Mama gets back."`
`‘Uryuu!`
` Let's play and play tonight and get in a really great mood{p:0:♪}`
` Let's play a lot in a secret party that we can only have when Mama isn't here.’`
`‘If we're lively enough, I'm sure plenty of friends will come to play from Wonderland and Looking‐Glass Land.`
` We'll have so many friends at that point that there simply won't be time left to feel bored.`
` Uryuu!’`
`"Uryuu!!"`
`......And then I started my pajama party with Sakutaro, and had fun until late into the night.`
`I played by sticking my hand into the bag of jellybeans without looking, and trying to guess which color I would pull out.`
`......Sakutaro had good intuition and got it right a lot.`
`{n}Partway through, I also achieved the brilliant feat of guessing right four times in a row.`
`The game where I split peanuts open and tried to guess which half would be the grandpa...`
`was easier than guessing the color of the jellybeans, so I got it right a lot.`
`Sucking my salt‐covered fingers was bad manners, but that was the yummiest part.`
`I like both orange juice and melon soda on their own.`
`I hoped that by mixing those two favorite drinks, there might be a flash of light like alchemy,`
` and a new drink that no one had ever tasted before would be created.`
`I got excited about how, if it turned out really delicious, I'd call it Sakutaro Soda and sell it.`
`But, unexpectedly, it had a weird and disappointing taste.`
`{n}And the color was somewhat dull and boring.`
`...Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised that orange and green mixed together would make this.`
` ......Too bad. I imagined that it would become a sparkling pineapple color.`
`But, it was an awesome, awesome, fun night.`
`If I'm having this much fun, maybe Mama will start wanting to come home too, and unexpectedly appear at the front door.`
`......So I got the feeling that Mama might suddenly come home,`
` and went to the front door many times to check, but there was no way Mama would be able to come home when she was this busy with work.`
`But rather than a feeling of loneliness,`
` I felt just a little disappointed that I couldn't invite Mama to join in on such a fun late‐night party.`
`Next time, I'll do this when Mama is around, and let her join in.`
`Even some things that I don't think are yummy, Mama says are delicious,`
` so she might say that Sakutaro Soda is really yummy.`
`When Mama comes back tired, I'll serve her some.`
`And more than anything.`
`......I wanted to at least write about this fun night in a letter, and tell Mama about it.`
`Hoping that these strong feelings of happiness would reach Mama too.`
`Hoping that when Mama comes home exhausted from her job, which is always so tough for her, I could share this happiness with her.`
`Hoping that when Mama comes home late Sunday night, almost certainly tired,`
` I could make her even just a little brighter by sharing this happiness......`
`I softly placed that letter on Mama's desk.`
`{e:070:To Mama.`
`{n}Good job with your work again today{p:0:☆} Some of my happiness for you to share.`
`{n}{m:-5:―}―From Maria}`
`Then, I decided to give a present to Sakutaro for proposing this wonderful night.`
`A small red scarf that I had found when searching for treasure in my closet.`
`When Maria was still very young, her mama had knitted this tiny, tiny, red scarf for her.`
`"Maria" was embroidered on it with knitting wool.`
`......She softly wrapped that scarf around Sakutaro.`
`It really suited him, accenting his yellow with red very well.`
`‘.........Uryu.`
` ...Does it suit me......?’`
`Sakutaro looked embarrassed as he wore his first present ever.`
`......Yeah.`
` It really suits him.`
`"Uu.`
` Sakutaro, thank you so much for everything.`
` It was so fun tonight.`
` I can't even remember why I was crying.`
` ......Let's always stick together, okay?`
` And let's always play and laugh together."`
`‘Uryuu!`
` Love you, Maria!’`
`"Me too.`
` Love you, Sakutaro."`
`After playing so wildly, my room was a mess.`
`Maybe I played a little too much.`
`......But I'm tired for today, so let's sleep together now.`
` And tomorrow, we'll clean up together and welcome Mama with a clean room.`
` ......Okay? Sakutaro?`
`Uryuu{p:0:♪}`
`"......See?`
` See how happy I...no, see how happy me and Sakutaro are?"`
`"..................`
` Is this your happiness, Maria onee‐chan...?"`
`"Yep.`
` I am happy."`
`"......Even though you were looking forward to that movie so much, and Aunt Rosa promised that she'd definitely take you, she completely forgot."`
`"She just happened to forget because she was so busy with work.`
` ......Even if she had remembered, she couldn't have done anything about it with her work."`
`"Whether she remembered or not, Mama would spend the night at work in either case.`
` She couldn't go to the movies.`
` .........Whether she remembered the promise or not is insignificant."`
`......There's no way that's insignificant.`
`After all, ......when Aunt Rosa replied "The movies?" on the phone,`
` it was obvious that she had completely forgotten her promise.`
`And when she heard that, Maria onee‐chan's mood definitely darkened.`
`"Well, ......like you say,`
` even if Aunt Rosa had remembered her promise, you wouldn't have been able to go to the movies in the end."`
`"......But even so.`
` ......To think that your mother just forgot her promise to spend one of her few days off with you, ...it's sad.`
` I'd be angry."`
`"..............................`
` ...Yeah.`
` It was sad.`
` Because even if she had remembered, we wouldn't have been able to go to the movies."`
`"......But after that, I had a very, very fun night with Sakutaro.`
` You must've thought that pajama party looked really fun too, Ange."`
`"...........................`
` There's no way that would be fun."`
`"...I mean, all of that messing around you did that night,`
` ......was just you intentionally making a frenzy out of nothing so you could forget that you were lonely and that your mother wasn't coming home."`
`"That's not true.`
` Really did have a fun party with Sakutaro."`
`"No, you didn't!`
` You were just so sad, and you hated your mother so much for forgetting her promise, that you made a mess of your room...!!"`
`"...............Where was something like that ever written in my diary?"`
`"It isn't {i:written} anywhere!`
` But......by reading in the gaps between every line, I can tell how you felt!`
` You didn't have a good time at all that evening!"`
`"And you stayed up late when you were told not to, broke the strict rule about not eating sweets outside of snack time,`
` ......and when even that didn't bury your sadness, you went wild in your room, .........and made a mess of it, isn't that all...?!!"`
`"And after you made a mess of your room and were all tired out,`
` .........all you did was claw at the bed sheets and cry yourself to sleep...!"`
`".........It is written in the diary that Mama probably forgot her promise about the movie,`
` and that I stayed up late having a pajama party with Sakutaro, ......and made a mess of my room searching for treasure."`
`"Yes.`
` And that.........can only mean one thing, can't it?!`
` You were starving for Auntie Rosa's love...!`
` And Aunt Rosa always put her work and her public image first, always keeping you on the back‐burner...!"`
`"That's why it makes my skin crawl!`
` Because I know just how superficial Aunt Rosa's words of {i:love} for you are!!`
` You should realize this yourself!"`
`"So......how can you say that you're happy?!`
` I don't {i:understand} that......that part of you, Maria onee‐chan!!`
` Even at this age, I can't understand it at all...!!"`
`"How aren't you sad?`
` How is it that you can experience a reality filled with misfortune and call yourself happy?!`
` I can't do it, I can't understand it...!!"`
`"...............You are a sad kid, Ange."`
`"I don't get it!!`
` Why are {i:you} pitying {i:me}?!"`
`".........Even though a "fact" about a really fun pajama party is written in my diary,`
` .........when it's observed by a different person, it looks like that same "fact" takes a different form, huh."`
`I remembered talking about this with {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`Truth is indeterminate and changes its form every time it's observed.`
`{n}By the way it is perceived, ...in other words, depending on the person who perceives it, a single truth becomes different truths.`
`And truths of the past are painted over by truths of the future......`
`"In this diary, I wrote that what happened that night was very, very fun."`
`"......You described the events of that night as something very happy."`
`"And yet, when you read the diary, you read the events of that night as very, very sad."`
`"......Even though you described it as happiness, I read it as something different."`
`"Stop it."`
`"................................."`
`"This...tells of a happy night.`
` .........This is...the "truth" of that night.`
` Please, don't take this happy truth,`
` ............and paint over it with a new and different truth."`
`"............Does this make you......happy, Maria onee‐chan?"`
`"Yep.`
` Happy.`
` .........That's why I feel so sorry for you, because you can't feel happiness in the same situation."`
`.........Both she back then, and I now, have the same friendless and lonely situation.`
`And Ange......accepted the lonely truth as the lonely truth.`
` But {i:she}......painted over the lonely truth with a happy truth.`
`Ushiromiya Maria took the sad truth...`
`...and changed it into happiness.`
`That...`
`...is the only, and yet all too large, ...difference between me and Maria onee‐chan.`
`And at the same time as being unable to accept it,`
` ......another part of me is jealous of that power.`
`"Yeah.`
` ......That's right.`
` It is "power".`
` ......With that power, I was able to become happy.`
` And without it, you can't."`
`"That.........power,`
` ............what is it............?"`
`"I didn't know what to call that power either.`
` ......At this point in time, at least.`
` ...Eventually, I would be taught its true form."`
`"......I'll talk about it later.`
` On a later page.`
` .........So then, so then, late Sunday night.`
` With a present, just like she'd promised, Mama came back......"`
`".........I'm back."`
`"Mamaaaa, welcome hoooooooome!!"`
`‘Uryuu!!`
` Mama came back, Mama came back!’`
`Waiting to greet Rosa, as she returned home all tired out,`
` was Maria, holding Sakutaro, in an unbelievably good mood.`
`Rosa's worn out expression was surely due at least in part to actual fatigue,`
` ......but also partially because she was sick and tired of having Maria cling to her and loudly whine and sob after being left alone in the house for a few days.`
`However, when she was welcomed by an unbelievably happy Maria,`
` ......and discovered unbelievably that her fears had been unfounded, Rosa couldn't hide her surprise.`
`"Wh‐......what's going on, Maria...?`
` You're in a great mood, aren't you...?!`
` Is someone here...?!"`
`It was strange enough to make Rosa think that a friend might have come over, and that she had come back home in the middle of them having a good time playing together.`
`But there were no other shoes by the entrance.`
`......Even though Maria was in such high spirits, she was home alone.`
`At first, Rosa was suspicious that this unexpectedly good mood might have some kind of unwelcome underlying cause,`
` but that really was a needless fear, ......and it really did seem to be that Maria had actually stayed at home in a good mood.`
`.........Even if Rosa's heart had been as cold and hard as a rock, ...after being welcomed with a smile like this...`
`...Rosa started to honestly accept that smile, and a smile rose to her own face automatically.`
`......In that smile, you could see none of the weariness caused by being unable to return home for several days.`
`Maria kept talking about what a fun time she'd had playing with the stuffed animal Sakutaro.`
`Rosa really hadn't imagined that the stuffed animal she'd gifted her would be liked so much, and she couldn't hide her pleasant surprise.`
`"I see.`
` So you and Sakutarou were having fun watching the house together.`
` Well done, Maria.`
` I have presents for you and Sakutarou for being so good."`
`‘Uryuu!`
` Presents!`
` Presents!’`
`"Uu!`
` I wonder what they are, I wonder what they are!"`
`Maria started jumping around with Sakutaro.`
`There were two presents.`
` One was a Western cake assortment.`
`It contained different kinds of Scotch cakes.`
` It looked to be of very high quality.`
`But Maria was more interested in the other one.`
`{n}The other one was an even bigger box, and it was pretty heavy.`
`"Open it and have a look.`
` They might become new friends for you and Sakutarou, who knows?"`
`"Wowwwwwwwwww...!`
` What's this!`
` What's this?!"`
`Inside, laid there like chess pieces, were about twenty small ceramic animal figures.`
`Squirrels, rabbits, small birds, dogs and cats.`
`{n}And they were all holding musical instruments.`
`In addition to them, there was also a panorama‐style background.`
`{n}A forest scene was drawn on it.`
`{n}Little woodland animals were all gathered around a forest clearing, and they looked like they were having a good time.`
`Rosa set it up on the table.`
`......And when she then lined up the ceramic figures like chess pieces in front of it,`
` .........it became a band of forest animals.`
`"Isn't it wonderful?`
` I saw it in the store window, and I was taken with it at a glance.`
` This is a present for you for being such a good girl home alone, Maria."`
`"Uuuu!!!`
` Thank you, Mamaaa!!!"`
`"Isn't this amazing, Sakutaro?!`
` Look how many more friends we have...!`
` It was just like you said, Sakutaro!`
` It was true, we had a fun and lively time, and we {i:did} get more friends...!"`
`‘See, didn't I tell you?`
` Look, we have more friends, look, we have more friends!`
` Uryu~{p:0:♪}’`
`Relieved that her gift had been appreciated,`
` Rosa suddenly remembered that she was filled with several days of weariness...`
`"Mama, you really worked hard...!`
` You should go take a shower.`
` If you take a hot one, I'm sure your tiredness will go away.`
` Want to take a bath?`
` I'll choose what to put in the bath today!"`
`"Thank you.`
` But it's already late, so you get ready for bed.`
` Mama's tired, so I'll just take a shower and go to bed right away.`
` I have to get up early tomorrow."`
`"Yep, okay!`
` Here, Mama, I'll take your coat off for youuu."`
`"No, really, I can do it myself...`
` ...Ahh, thank you."`
`"Your coat is full of smells from outside.`
` ......Uu?`
` Oh, sorry, dropped something.`
` I'll pick it up, okay?"`
`When she had taken Rosa's coat, a receipt or ticket stub or something had fallen out.`
`...It had been in her mama's pocket, so it was probably important.`
`Maria hurriedly picked it up...`
`It looked like a ticket for a Green Car or the Shinkansen or something.`
`............Atami?`
` Maybe it's that place famous for its hot springs...?`
`Just then.`
` ...A razor‐sharp sound shattered the warm atmosphere.`
`Instead of the Rosa who had been there just a second ago, enjoying a gift with her daughter and full of weariness after returning home for the first time in several days,`
` .........there stood a completely different person, who looked exactly the same, but had the most terrible of expressions on her face.`
`...In her hand was the ticket stub that Maria had picked up.`
`{n}...She had stolen it from Maria's hand in an instant.`
`After a few seconds' delay,`
` ...by the pain of her hand that had been hit,`
` and her mother's expression,`
` Maria realized that she must have done something wrong.`
`But she didn't know what she had done that had gotten her in trouble.`
`......It was probably because of that ticket‐stub‐like thing.`
`Was she not supposed......to touch it.........?`
`Even though she had tried so hard to welcome her mama with fun and happiness,`
` ...she had touched something important to her without asking, and had ruined that pleasant atmosphere...`
`......So Maria apologized immediately.`
`"S‐......sorry........."`
`"............nh.`
` .................."`
`Even though she must have heard those words of apology, Rosa's expression actually darkened.`
`...Maybe those words had been undesired?`
`Maria didn't know what to do, and cautiously watched to see how her mother would act...`
`Then, even though it should have been such an important ticket stub,`
` Rosa crushed it up and hurried off to her room...`
`Maria......didn't really understand what she had done wrong......`
`".........Uu......`
` ......I must have...`
`......done something I shouldn't have......`
` ...That paper must have been something important for Mama's work.`
` And I touched it without asking..."`
`‘Uryu......`
` ...You didn't do anything wrong, Maria.........`
` ...So look how happy we are tonight as well.’`
`"Yeah.`
` ...Happy."`
`‘And when Mama takes a bath and clears her head, she'll go back to being the normal, nice Mama.`
` So you mustn't worry about it.`
` Uryu.’`
`"You're right......`
` Mama's tired too, after all.`
` ......Uu, mustn't worry about it.`
` We're so very happy tonight."`
`‘Uryu.’`
`"..................Please stop.`
` ...I can't bear to watch this."`
`"......Ange, I think you're looking for happiness in the wrong way."`
`"You're the one who's wrong!!`
` How can you call this happiness...?!!`
` It's too...painful for me even to watch it anymore!!"`
`"What is...?`
` That Mama suddenly got mad?`
` .........That happens sometimes when people get tired.`
` ......Condemning a person because of a momentary misplaced emotion isn't very adult of you, Ange."`
`"......I can't believe I'm hearing this from a nine‐year‐old...`
` But that's not the problem, is it?!`
` That ticket stub you picked up was clearly strange!"`
`"How?`
` There was nothing strange about it, and it has nothing to do with the happiness of that night..."`
`"Aunt Rosa called you saying she'd be staying over at work because of her job, right?!`
` Why Atami?!`
` Isn't that what you call a vacation?!"`
`"It means she left you behind and went on a vacation, doesn't it?!`
` And you normally don't go on a vacation by yourse—"`
`"Even if that was a ticket for Atami,`
` that alone doesn't make it proof that Mama lied and went on a vacation, does it...?"`
`"She lied on the phone, changed her expression like that and grabbed it from you!`
` What more proof could you want...?!!"`
`".........It might be from a business trip long ago, right?`
` Or maybe she just happened to pick up some trash or something and put it in her pocket.`
` It might even be a receipt from someone who works for her who went on a business trip."`
`"...In that case, it was important for her work.`
` It wasn't a toy, so I can understand why Mama took it away.`
` ......This evidence you're talking about is nothing more than circumstantial evidence.`
` Imagination and delusions.`
` ......I don't know why you're interpreting it so that my relationship with Mama is bad."`
`"I'm the one who doesn't understand how you can interpret it in a way that's so convenient for Aunt Rosa!!"`
`".........You really are a poor child, Ange.`
` .........There are fragments that could make you happy,`
` so many of them, scattered all about your feet, and you can't find them."`
`"......Instead, all you find are the unhappy fragments, and you keep getting hurt over and over.`
` ......That's why you get scared of being hurt,`
` ......and you can't start even looking for happiness until after you've finished making sure that there's nothing around you that could hurt you."`
`"..................When I talk with you, Onee‐chan, it gets hard to tell which one of us isn't making sense."`
`"You know what?`
` There are lots and lots of both happy and unhappy fragments, and the world is full to the brim with both kinds.`
` So people who can't find happiness right beside them won't be able to find it no matter where they go looking.`
` ......Like Tyltyl and Mytyl searching for the blue bird."`
`"............Yes.`
` The story did have that moral."`
`"You're the complete opposite, Ange.`
` You're searching for a world without a single unhappy fragment.`
` But even that's the same as the blue bird.`
` So you'll be unable to find your own happiness for all eternity."`
`"............Battler is Hansel, is he?`
` Isn't he the blue bird......?"`
`"......Give it a rest already.`
` .........In any event, I got the point that a night of happiness was wasted because of a single scrap of paper that fell from a coat."`
`"It's scary, isn't it?`
` That a single scrap of paper could do that.`
` ......In that case, maybe the power to get happiness back can also lie in a single scrap of paper, don't you think?"`
`Just when she had finally been able to bond with Maria after so long......`
`Rosa's face twisted with a mixture of anger, sadness, and a fierce self‐hatred as she flew into her room and closed the door.`
`.........Maria's "sorry" had stuck into her chest more sharply than any knife.`
`Then,`
` ......she noticed a cute envelope placed on her study table.`
`It was probably something that had come with a girls' magazine.`
`.........To Mama.`
` Some of my happiness for you to share, it said.`
`She took it, .........hesitated, opened it, ...and read what was inside.`
`....................................`
`Then, after dotting the surface of the paper...`
`with two large tears...`
`......she flew out of the room,`
` hugged Maria from behind as she headed for the bathroom,`
` .........buried her face into her daughter's back,`
` ......and cried.`
`And, realizing that she was the one who should truly be saying sorry,`
` ...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`she apologized to her.`
`And when Maria asked why,`
` she gave no answer......`
`".........See.`
` Already made up.`
` .........A little thing like that was absolutely nothing to worry about, because of the friendliness between Mama and me."`
`"........................`
` .........Your happiness is...too painful for me."`
`"......I do understand your feelings more or less, Ange.`
` ......Until I realized my "power",`
` ...even I was just like you, a sorry child who could only find fragments filled with misfortune."`
`"............What is this "power"?`
` This power that I don't have, but you do.`
` ...And are you saying that me not having it is the reason I have misery and you have joy?`
` .........Just what is this {i:thing} that you can't describe except with an abstract word like "power"......?"`
`"Yeah.`
` That is what you want to know, isn't it, Ange?`
` ......That's why you've been reading my story all this time."`
`"............Of course I'll teach you.`
` The secret to that power.`
` ......And I did teach you about it long ago, when you were little, you know...?`
` Did you forget...?"`
`"Don't worry, you'll be able to remember.`
` ......Now I...`
`......no, she.`
` She will teach you."`
`"............She......?`
` Who's that?"`
`{a:c:`
`"I shall teach you in {f:5:Maria}'s place."}`
`".........B‐`
`............{f:5:Beatrice}..............."`
`"The "power" that {f:5:Maria} has, but you do not."`
`"Yep.`
` The "power" I have, but you do not."`
`{m:-5:―}―{i:That}...is magic.`
`Maria and Beato said it together.`
` And then they started giggling because they'd said it at the same time.`
`......It was an innocent behavior, which seemed somehow unlike Beato.`
`Black tea was arranged on a table in a peaceful garden,`
` and Beato, Maria, and Sakutarou, who was sitting on Maria's lap, were having fun chatting...`
`"............Hoh.`
` I see, so he is called Sakutarou.`
` And your best friend, you say!"`
`‘Uryu...`
` It's nice to meet you, my name is Sakutarou...’`
`"Uu, Sakutaro is shy so he's nervous right now.`
` It's okay, {f:5:Beatrice} is my wonderful friend too...!"`
`‘Uryu.`
` Are your friends my friends...?’`
`"Yeah!"`
`‘Uryu. ......Then I'm {f:5:Beatrice}'s friend too?’`
`"Yeah!"`
`‘Uryuu!’`
`"......Maria, do things like this happen frequently for you in your everyday life?"`
`"Uu?`
` Things?"`
`"Is breathing a soul of magic into inorganic matter and giving it life in this way...`
`a commonplace practice for you?"`
`"......Uu.`
` Sakutaro isn't inorganic matter, he's a lion cub."`
`‘Uryuu!’`
`"Hmm......`
` ......A stuffed animal makes for an excellent vessel.`
` Therefore, when it is spoken to by an innocent child without toxin, it is not uncommon for a spirit to take up residence within, in an attempt to respond to them."`
`According to {f:5:Beatrice}, when a child "plays with dolls",`
` the dolls sometimes gain an actual will and converse with them, in rare cases even moving on their own.`
`However, the power that they can imbue into such a vessel is very weak due to their innocence.`
`If even a tiny bit of the toxin from a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}'s common sense gets involved, and tells them that there's no way a doll can talk or move,`
` it instantly reverts to being an ordinary non‐speaking doll......`
`"However, ......this...Sakutarou stuffed animal of yours is different."`
`"Uu!`
` Sakutaro is a stuffed animal, but he's not just a stuffed animal!"`
`‘Uryuu!`
` Lion cuuuub!`
` Ga‐...ga‐......uryuu!’`
`"Sakutaro is a lion cub, but he's still a kid, so he can't say {ruby:roar:gaooo} sometimes.`
` Uryu‐uryu‐uryu{p:0:♪}"`
`‘Uryu‐uryu‐uryuu!’`
`{f:5:Beatrice} let out a sigh of admiration as she gazed at Maria, playing around with Sakutaro at the table loaded with tea.`
`".........How incredible.`
` This "Sakutarou", with a core of a cloth‐and‐cotton vessel, has completely manifested into the human world.`
` He has his own character, talks with his summoner freely,`
` {i:and even moves by his own will}."`
`"......And what is most surprising is that you did not summon him by name as a being from another world,`
` but created him out of the sea of zero."`
`After that, Maria boasted to Beato that Sakutarou wasn't her only friend, and that when she went home, there would be plenty more of them.`
`She claimed that there were other similar stuffed animals and dolls who, like Sakutarou, could talk and move of their own will.`
`It was something natural to Maria.`
` It was {i:natural} for stuffed animals to talk, move, and become her friends of their own free will.`
`......When she heard Maria speak of this in that way, {f:5:Beatrice}, as a witch, felt a respect bordering on awe.`
`"............Maria.`
` Without a doubt, that power of yours is magic."`
`"It's magic......?`
` But I'm still a witch apprentice, I'm not able to use magic yet..."`
`"Not so, it is magic indeed.`
` .........You may be an apprentice since you are unable to use it in full awareness of that fact,`
` ......but even so, what power this magic has!`
` The manifestation of your friend Sakutarou is excellent proof of that."`
`"Many...festation...?"`
`"Mm.`
` In your case, it may even be fitting to call it creation.`
` ......A piece of inorganic matter that would have no soul at all in another's hands has had a soul imbued into it through your magic."`
`"Furthermore, you are using strong power to keep it tethered to the human world.`
` ......In this era so filled with the toxin that denies magic, maintaining the magical power necessary to manifest a being to the degree that it can exist as an independent life‐form is not easy even for me."`
`It isn't hard to create soulless beings in any number.`
`{n}However, creating a being with a soul is very difficult.`
`{n}...Beato declared this definitively.`
`".........Don't really understand what you're saying, Beato.`
` You're saying Sakutaro is amazing...?"`
`"I am saying that you and Sakutarou both are marvelous.`
` ......You may feel proud.`
` ...Yes, that which Kinzo desired above all else seems to dwell most strongly within you."`
`"Don't have a clue why you're praising me so much.`
` Ri~ght, Sakutaro?"`
`‘Uryu~!’`
`"......What is truly admirable is not only that you have caused a soul to reside in a stuffed animal.`
` It is the fact that by that act, you have changed your own worldview.`
` ......Your power to create something from nothing is beyond exceptional."`
`"......It is simple to make a hundred from one.`
` However, creating one from zero is not easy.`
` ...When you become a full witch, you may not only be a match for me, but might even grow into a Great Witch that I must acknowledge as superior."`
`"The Witch of Origins, perhaps.`
` .........I, too, am greatly looking forward to your future."`
`"Uu!`
` Beato said I have talent as a wi~tch!"`
`‘Isn't that great, Maria?!`
` Uryu, Beato...thank you for praising Maria.’`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` There is no need to thank me, Sakutarou.`
` That red scarf truly suits you.`
` And I am envious of the talent of your master that enabled her to create a friend like you."`
`‘Uryu~!`
` Thanks for complimenting my scarf.`
` I got it as a present from Maria.`
` I really like it.’`
`"And its size is truly as if it was created just for you.`
` ......Yes, in light of this, I see that I must also give my new friend some kind of present."`
`"Uu?`
` Beato, you're giving Sakutaro a present......?"`
`"A gift from a witch must be something with magical power, of course.`
` In that case, so that your friend can remain your friend for all time, and so that you can have even more fun playing with him..."`
`"I shall give Sakutarou my magic power.`
` It should allow him to achieve an even stronger manifestation."`
`"Uu?`
` I'll be able to have much more fun playing with Sakutaro...?`
` How?"`
`‘Uryu......?`
` What could it be, Maria...`
` Is it something scary......?’`
`"Don't worry.`
` Beato won't do anything scary.`
` Right, {f:5:Beatriceee}?!"`
`"Mm.`
` I am certain that he will like it.`
` .........Let us see then...yes, in order to achieve a stronger manifestation, a stronger image will be necessary.`
` .........Well, now, what to do.`
` Hmmmmmmmmmm..."`
`Beato folded her arms and thought about what she could do to please them the most.`
`And at that moment, there appeared...`
`......the form of yet another witch.`
`{n}It was Beato's master, {f:5:Virgilia}.`
`{f:5:Virgilia} truly was a Great Witch.`
`...Since Maria already thought of Beato as a Great Witch, this person Beato called a Great Witch must have been a Great Great Witch.`
`According to Beato, not even she could hold a candle to this witch when it came to magical power.`
`"My, my.`
` I {i:thought} I heard some cheery voices.`
` What a fun tea party this seems to be..."`
`"Oh, Master.`
` Perfect timing.`
` I want you to take a look at this lion cub.`
` I hear he's Maria's new friend."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` What an adorable little lion.`
` ......I wonder if he can greet me?`
` Hello, nice to meet you...?"`
`‘U‐uryuu!`
` I, I'm Sakutarou.’`
`Sakutaro got back down onto Maria's lap, and greeted {f:5:Virgilia} with half of his face poking out over the edge of the table.`
`...He seemed to be very nervous since this was a witch that even Beato called Master.`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` What a lovely name.`
` ......As a reward for giving such a good greeting, here's a sweet for you."`
`After waving her hands about, {f:5:Virgilia} held the palm of her hand upwards, and made a movement as though lightly grasping some of the air.`
`Then, she held that closed fist out in front of Sakutaro.`
`............And when she opened it, there lay one of those individually wrapped cough drops.`
`‘Uryuu?!`
` It's candy, Maria, oh wow, oh wow...!!’`
`"Uu!`
` Isn't that nice, Sakutaro?!`
` Make sure to thank her."`
`‘Uryu.`
` Thank you very much for the candy.`
` ...*bow*.’`
`Even though {f:5:Virgilia} was a Great Great Witch, she still treated a stuffed animal like Sakutarou to an elegant greeting.`
`"Still, Master, cough drops? Are you someone's granny or something...?!`
` Can't you at least pull out some strawberry‐milk candy~?"`
`"How mean.`
` Perhaps I won't give you candy anymore?"`
`"Kuhhyahhyahhya, sorry, sorry.`
` .........Well then, Maria.`
` Take out your grimoire.`
` And, of course, your writing tools."`
`"Uu?`
` Okay, taking it out.`
` Are we writing something?"`
`"......Oh? What's happening now?"`
`"I will use a magic I learned from you, Master.`
` .........Magic to make a resident of another world manifest into a vessel."`
`"I think that by applying that, I may be able to further strengthen the power manifesting this friend of Maria's.`
` ......I want to give that as a gift to Maria and her friend."`
`"I see.`
` ...It shouldn't be that difficult for a being that has already manifested.`
` That seems like it will turn out to be a wonderful gift.`
` Well then, I shall offer what modest help I can."`
`"If you shall be signing for this magic personally as a witness, Master, that is greatly encouraging...!`
` Rejoice, Maria.`
` This shall be a wonderful gift...!"`
`‘Uryu...?`
` What's happening...?`
` It isn't scary, is it?`
` Is it...?’`
`"Don't know.`
` But don't think it's scary.`
` ......Wonder what it is. Exciting, huh?"`
`Beato borrowed the grimoire from Maria's handbag and majestically riffled through the pages.`
`......Then, finding an empty page among those with magic circles drawn on them, she flattened the book out.`
`And after staring at Sakutarou with a smirk, she suddenly started darting her pen across the page.`
`......It was something like a written proclamation made by witches to a higher‐order world.`
`Magic, which would take effect by {f:5:Beatrice} writing it and {f:5:Virgilia} giving her signature as a witness.`
`Maria didn't understand what Beato was doing at first, but partway through, she figured out the wonderful magic power of this document, and her eyes began to sparkle...`
`‘Uryu?!`
` Uryu?!`
` What is it, Maria, what's she drawing?!`
` Uryu‐uryu?!’`
`Sakutarou was on her lap, so he didn't know what was being written up on the table.`
`......But even if he had seen, Sakutarou probably wouldn't have understood.`
`"It's amazing, Sakutaro!!`
` Wait a bit, almost done, almost done!`
` Beato that's awesome, Beato that's awesome!!"`
`".........When it comes to writing documents of power, this child's talent is splendid.`
` I expect you could even work as a secretary in the netherworld."`
`"How is this...?!`
` It should be passable...!"`
`After she had completed the thing she had been so intensely concentrating on, Beato looked over the document again from a distance.`
`......It seemed she was fairly satisfied with her work.`
`And Maria, upon also peeking in at it, let out a cry of wonder.`
`"......It's amazing, Beato!!`
` So cuuute!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"By the name of the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}, I hereby acknowledge Sakutarou, {f:5:Maria}'s child.`
` .........Master, if you would sign as a witness!"`
`"Yes, yes.`
` ......By my name, I stand witness to and acknowledge this oath.`
` .........It is done."`
`{f:5:Virgilia} signed, completing the proclamation.`
`It was a powerful document that proclaimed to the beings of a higher world that Sakutarou had most certainly manifested in the human world.`
`Sakutarou, created by Maria, had received the recommendation of the two witches {f:5:Beatrice} and {f:5:Virgilia},`
` and in this very moment, the higher world had accepted his existence.`
`......That was the great magic of manifestation.`
`According to Beato, it was apparently an incredible stroke of luck that {f:5:Virgilia} had been here.`
`Because the power residing in the proclamation would change drastically depending on the number and the ranks of the witches signing it.`
`{f:5:Virgilia} in particular had many friends in the higher world,`
` so her signature gave the proclamation a power with which Beato's couldn't even compare.`
`"By this proclamation, I accept thee, Sakutarou, as an individual with thine own sense of self.`
` And I welcome thee as a friend in accordance with the treaty of Mariage Sorcière.`
` Henceforth, Sakutarou, thou art our common friend."`
`"And as a gift, I shall bestow upon you a form appropriate to that status.`
` Accept it."`
`With the grimoire still opened to the page with the proclamation, she turned it around and handed it to Maria.`
`Maria showed it to Sakutarou on her lap.`
`When Sakutarou beheld that proclamation,`
` ............in his body made of cloth and cotton,`
` he felt something hot and bright begin to dwell.`
`Even as he looked around, nervous at this sensation that he had never felt before, that power strengthened,`
` ......and eventually, a bright light completely swallowed him up...`
`‘Uryu......?`
` Uryu‐uryu‐uryu‐uryu......!’`
`And when that light disappeared...`
`............There, Maria's friend Sakutarou held a new form, and {i:existed}.`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!`
` You're cute, Sakutaro!`
` Reeeeally cute!"`
`‘Uryu...?`
` Uryuu...`
` Does it really suit me?`
` It isn't embarrassing......?’`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` It is a very lovely form, Sakutarou‐chan."`
`"I felt that the scarf was his charm point, you see.`
` And the ears!`
` Animal ears are nice indeed, truly cute!`
` Allow me to nibble at them later.`
` *cackle*!"`
`"Thank you, {f:5:Beatriceee}!!`
` Thank you so much for the wonderful present!!"`
`"There is no need for thanks.`
` This is merely an expression of my respect for your wonderful magic and your friend."`
`".........And now that you have reached this level, it would not be odd for you to graduate from an apprentice at any time.`
` Starting today, I shall initiate you in even newer and more fun forms of magic."`
`"......From this point forward, you may call yourself {f:5:Maria}, the Apprentice Witch of Origins."`
`"What's the Witch of Origins...?"`
`"Mm.`
` It is the title of a witch who seeks to become a Creator.`
` Right now, you are just an Enchanter, possessing only enough strength to breathe magical power into the small objects around you."`
`"......But after one thousand years of training, it is not unthinkable that you could create not just your own {i:system} of magic, but even a galaxy."`
`"......The talent of the Witch of Origins is very rare.`
` Even though everyone has it when they are young, no one can continue to hold onto it.`
` ......This title is also proof that you have not lost your untainted heart."`
`"Uu!!`
` Witch of Origins, wow!`
` I'll become one!`
` I'm the Apprentice Witch of Origiiins!"`
`‘Maria, that's so cool...!`
` The Witch of Origins, wow, awesome, uryuu!’`
`"Eventually, you will probably be able to call yourself by the title of a full witch—Lady {f:5:Maria}, the Witch of Origins.`
` ......It may be a good time now to give not only Sakutarou, but you as well, an appearance fitting for your rank."`
`".........There.`
` I shall give a proper outfit for one who, while an apprentice, is worthy of calling herself a witch."`
`When Beato waved the pipe that was her wand,`
` many gold butterflies appeared out of nowhere, grouped around Maria, and granted her a wonderful dress.`
`Endowed with both cuteness and majesty, it was indeed a fitting article of clothing for the girl who would eventually take the name of the Witch of Origins...`
`"Oh wow...!!`
` Awesome awesome awesome awesome!!`
` So cute, so cute!`
` I want to show these clothes to Mama too...!!`
` Can't I?"`
`"The full dress of a witch must not be shown indiscriminately.`
` Such a thing is worth more if you reserve it for those most grandiose occasions.`
` *cackle*!"`
`And then, the Great Witch, the witch, the witch's apprentice, and their new friend Sakutarou, had a lively time enjoying their tea together......`
`".........See?`
` Look how happy I am.`
` And look how fun this is."`
`"..........................."`
`"Please, don't be afraid of being happy.`
` Becoming happy isn't the same thing as accepting your current misfortune.`
` It means creating a new happiness within your current misfortune.`
` That is the Magic of Origins."`
`"......I...didn't want to acknowledge my current world.`
` ......I couldn't abide accepting such an isolated and painful world.`
` ...That's why, even though I was entranced by your world, Maria onee‐chan,`
` ......I couldn't cross the final line."`
`"............I'll teach you.`
` About my Magic of Origins.`
` No, I taught you before, right?`
` And you used to be able to use it.`
` Did you forget......?"`
`"..........................."`
`"You were also a witch apprentice, Ange, with your name entered into Mariage Sorcière, weren't you?"`
`"............Yes.`
` So I was.`
` .........Mariage Sorcière,`
` ...that takes me back.`
` ......I also had my name entered in there at one point, didn't I..."`
