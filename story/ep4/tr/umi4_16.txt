`It goes without saying, but since the time she was born, ......Jessica was raised in this mansion.`
`The Western‐style house that the cousins simply called "the mansion" was her home.`
`And yet, she had never understood her cousins' feelings as much as she did today.`
`......And at the same time, her own home, which she knew well, had never felt so different a place as it did now......`
`Her own.........room.`
`This had once been her personal hideaway, the only place in this vast mansion where she could feel at peace.`
`However, ......that door had never felt as intimidating as it did now.`
`".........A test, he says...?`
` Tch, what the hell has he got waiting in there......`
` He better not have ransacked my desk and stuff......"`
`She acted tough, trying to deceive herself.`
`{n}......Trying to make herself believe that she wasn't scared of anything.`
`She readied herself, and opened the door to her room.`
`"...................................."`
`......When she saw that, fortunately, the room didn't appear to have been messed with, she relaxed.`
`No one......was there.`
` ......Of course.`
`{n}There was nowhere for anyone to hide here.`
`Right away, Jessica locked the door behind her.`
`{n}......Now the room was safe.`
`She peeked under the bed and in the closet, but of course, no one was hiding.`
`"......Wh‐......what the hell.`
` ...Haha, ...haha...!"`
`She looked at the clock.`
` ......Ten past eleven, or just a little past that.`
`As her tension lessened and fatigue came back to her entire body, she realized how messed up this whole day had been.`
`It was still only eleven.`
`......The plan had been for all the cousins to get together, have fun playing around, and talk animatedly about all kinds of things together into the night.`
`Normally, we would have been doing that kind of thing at this very moment.`
`{n}Why has that......turned into this......?`
`".........It's all that old bastard's fault......`
` ......How could he do that...to Mom......`
`to everyone........."`
`Her head was swimming with anger and sadness......`
` But there was no one here to direct those emotions at.`
`......Because of the lock, this room's security was guaranteed.`
`{n}Remembering that one more time, Jessica somehow regained her calm......`
`If it keeps up like this and nothing happens...`
`{n}Jessica thought that she would like to go to the dining hall and see her mother's last face.`
`......Even though Gohda had emphasized so strongly that it was gruesome and that she definitely shouldn't look at it,`
` even so, she wanted to see her mother's face one final time...`
`But they had been warned repeatedly that doing anything stupid would put the hostages in danger.`
`......Could it be that locking the door was also against the rules......?`
`If I close myself up in here, I alone might be saved.`
`......But if I don't open it, it will surely be against the rules, and Dad, Kanon‐kun, Shannon, Auntie Kyrie, and Doctor Nanjo...`
`will be killed.`
`............There's no way the scales balance between five lives and my own one life.`
`Jessica tightly shut her eyes, resisting the other part of herself which said "Isn't it alright as long as {i:I} survive?",`
` ......headed to the door, and made to unlock it.`
`......Just then.`
`Clap, clap, clap......`
`A crisp applause rang out, making Jessica's heart leap...`
`"If the door had remained locked, it might have been in violation of the rules, and harm could have come to the hostages.`
` ......But even so, your own life might be saved."`
`"However, you resisted that temptation and were about to unlock the door yourself.`
` That bravery of yours is worthy of admiration."`
`"Wh‐who..............."`
`I, the owner of this room,`
` ......had searched to make sure there was nowhere any human could have been hiding...`
` .........Where had this...man...`
`.........There was nowhere for a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} to hide,`
` ......but could something that wasn't {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} have managed it.........?`
`I was pretty sure this was my first meeting with this largely built, middle‐aged man.`
` ......I did not recognize this guy, who looked like a butler and bore the seal of the One‐winged Eagle.`
`"A pleasure to meet you, Jessica‐sama.`
` .........I serve as head furniture for the Master, the 27th of the 72.`
` I am called Ronove."`
`"......Rono...ue......?`
` ............Genji...san............?"`
`"......Ah, yes, ...Genji is like my little brother.`
` Or perhaps he was my true form in this world.`
` ......Perhaps you could even say he was a vessel."`
`".........What's...this guy...saying.........?"`
`"Oh, my apologies.`
` This is not something that can be explained to a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` .........Well then, let us move on to the main event."`
`"So this is that old crackpot's...`
`...test or whatever........."`
`"Correct.`
` This is the test that the Master has granted you."`
`At Ronove's elegant gesture, like that of a butler ordering for the meal to be set out,`
` many gold butterflies flew up out of nowhere......`
`"Gwah?!`
` What the...hell......?!"`
`The swarm of gold butterflies spun around, forming a small swirl as they gathered in one place.`
`......Then, that golden mound disappeared like a pile of leaves blown away by a cold wintry wind,`
` ......and there lay a Western envelope with the One‐winged Eagle crest done on it in gold leaf......`
`Ronove gestured to her to pick it up.`
`{n}Jessica timidly picked it up, and opened the letter inside......`
`".....................What is...this......?"`
`"It is an exceedingly simple test that looks for the qualifications for becoming the next head.`
` ......Please attend to the question written there with the readiness of the next head who will bear responsibility for the Ushiromiya family,`
` and tell me your answer, as well as the thoughts that led you to it."`
`"......Wh‐............what the...utter hell..............."`
`Shaking, Jessica looked back and forth between the paper and Ronove's face several times......`
`......At that time, George, who had been called out after Jessica, could be seen in the arbor of the rose garden.`
`He had been planning to give Shannon the ring that would be proof of their engagement...here, tonight, at this time...if things had gone normally.`
`...But the woman in front of George now was not Shannon.`
`"......Read it.`
` That is {f:5:Goldsmith}'s test for you."`
`".............................."`
`George picked up the Western envelope on the table where he had once drunk tea with Shannon,`
` and read its contents......`
`Perhaps its message was short.`
` After a single glance at it, George's eyes grew sharp.`
`"............What is this...`
`supposed to be?"`
`"Ehheheheheh.`
` ......It's what it looks like.`
` This is the test given to you, to find if you have the qualifications to be the successor to the head.`
` ......Ask yourself what makes you qualified to be the successor, as you answer the question."`
`".........What a...stupid question."`
`"I agree.`
` It really is a stupid question.`
` .........In that case, isn't the Ushiromiya family headship something just as trivial in {f:5:Goldsmith}'s eyes?`
` ......Heheheh."`
`George lowered his eyes to the surface of the letter once again, and examined its contents......`
`George and Jessica.`
` ......While the tests given to them were slightly different, they were almost exactly the same.`
`"......‘Among the three mentioned below.`
` In order to gain two, sacrifice one.’"`
`"It's a simple three‐choice test.`
` .........Decide for yourself which one you will choose not to save."`
`"If you refuse to choose, the test is suspended.`
` I have been given permission to kill you right here by my own hands.`
` .........If you would include even that as a choice, then there are four choices."`
`"It's been an awful long time since I've gotten to play with a kid like you, so I can't say I'd be disappointed."`
`".........Are these three choices only a test?`
` Or will the choice be accompanied by its result?"`
`"Don't be naive.`
` ......The one you choose will definitely lose their life."`
`"......................................."`
`{a:c:{e:070:Among the three mentioned below.`
`{n}In order to gain two, sacrifice one.`
`{n}{n}1. Your life`
`{n}2. Shannon's life`
`{n}3. Everyone else's lives`
`{n}{n}If you do not choose one, all of the above will be lost.}}`
`"...............Why is Shannon's name here?"`
`"The second choice has the name of the one most needed by that person, and most loved.`
` ......I believe Kanon's name is written second on Jessica's test."`
`".........You gave this stupid question to Jessica too...?"`
`"*giggle*giggle*.`
` ......What does Jessica matter?`
` Right now, you are the one being tested."`
`"It really is a simple three‐choice test.`
` Which can you throw away for the sake of the other two?`
` ......Isn't that simple?`
` If you still can't decide, would you like me to lend you a coin......?"`
`"......A coin?`
` How would you choose between three options with something that only has two sides?"`
`"There's no one who would throw away their own life.`
` ......So naturally only two options remain.`
` Will you give up on everyone for the sake of the one you love?`
` Or will you give up on the one person you love so that you can save as many people as possible?"`
`"Either way, you can fit it with an appropriate just cause.`
` After all, this Rokkenjima is now a demon island.`
` ......The sickly sweet buddy‐buddy pretense of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world is not necessary.`
` No one will blame you.`
` Do as your heart desires."`
`"......While asking yourself whether you possess the fitting qualifications to succeed the headship of the Ushiromiya family...`
` No, make your decision as though you yourself {i:are} the Ushiromiya family head.`
` Ehheheheheh......"`
`".........................................."`
`".........What.........the hell do you take me for............"`
`Jessica crumpled the letter up and threw it on the floor.`
`"I believe your anger is quite appropriate.`
` ......I also find it an exceedingly pitiful, and truly ludicrous question.`
` ......Pu ku ku ku."`
`"Like hell there's anyone who could wish for their own death.`
` And...like hell there's anyone who could want to remain alive after abandoning the life of the person they l‐...love.`
` ......And......like hell there's anyone who could massacre everyone else......as long as it's good for the two of them......!"`
`"No, Jessica‐sama.`
` Such a person could exist."`
`"This is Rokkenjima, the demon island!`
` It is now completely cut off from the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world and dunked fully into the netherworld like cheese fondue.`
` The values of the human world will be taken out with the trash."`
`"Pu ku ku!`
` So please.`
` Choose the things you desire from the bottom of your heart, in the order you desire them.`
` Whatever remains will be your answer, and one most fitting for this insane night."`
`"Screw you!!`
` How could I......choose any of these?!!"`
`"‘If you do not choose one, all of the above will be lost’...`
`also makes for a fine fourth choice.`
` It may also be interesting if that one is chosen."`
`"But since choosing that will result in the loss of your own life in the end, I believe it would be more wise to do the honorable thing and select number one, "your life",`
` so that the other two will be saved.`
` ......All is entrusted to your decision, Jessica‐sama."`
`"Please, let me hear an answer and conviction fitting for the successor to the Ushiromiya family......!!`
` I am sincerely hoping for a wonderful answer, fitting for the Master's descendant who shares his blood!!"`
`"Da‐......damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittt......"`
`That scene was being observed through a magic crystal ball being held by Kinzo.`
`Kinzo finally couldn't hold it back; spreading his arms and facing the heavens, he began laughing in an explosive voice......`
`"Fuhahahahahahaha, waahha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!`
` Why do you hesitate, foolish grandchildren and descendants of mine!!"`
`"This is a simple problem that can be answered immediately!`
` It should cause less vacillation than whether to put butter or jam on your morning toast!!`
` ......Do you people know the correct answer?"`
`He turned and stared wide‐eyed at the Chiester Sisters, who had been faithfully standing in wait behind him.`
`"N‐no, no, my apologies, I don't know, Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}!"`
`"Fool, not choosing at all means GAME OVEE{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}EEER!!!`
` You foolish rabbit, who cannot even choose a reason or a goal for her own life...!!"`
`"You have not the value of a single ant that anyone might step upon without even noticing!!`
` Die! Be crushed!! Disappear faster than I can blink!!`
` ......And what of you?"`
`"......I would sacrifice the first one, "my life", sir.`
` Weapons exist to fight and die in battle.`
` And weapons exist to destroy enemies and protect allies.`
` If we can die protecting those we love, we can die satisfied, sir."`
`"Hoh.`
` A truly splendid model answer for a weapon.`
` The immediate reply is very nice.`
` ......Have you been taught that you'll be given an extra carrot for answering that way?`
` Heheheheh, that's not it, is it noowwwwww?`
` Even that isn't it, is it noww{-}w{-}w{-}w{-}w{-}w{-}wwww...?"`
`"You are merely answering the way you have been told to answer, repeating the answer you have been indoctrinated with!!`
` You are the same as that other rabbit a second ago.`
` You still live without having chosen a purpose or a goal to live for...!!`
` Filth whose life has no value...!`
` It would fit you well to crush you down and use you as fodder for the other livestock!!"`
`"...............`
` ...Yes sir!`
` A‐animal fodder...would be an honor......!"`
`"I don't think sooooo!`
` You don't want to see anyone else die anymore, doooo youuuu?`
` Why can't you accept that?`
` Accept that your old wounds are still festering and rotting deep, deep inside...!"`
`"Yes, the rotting stench almost makes the nose wrinkle, you foolish rotten rabbit!!`
` These are words of praise for you!!"`
`".........Th‐thank you very much...sir......"`
`"Well then, what about you, the last one.`
` Which of the three choices would you choose...?"`
`"Nihi.`
` Number two without hesitation."`
`"Hoh...`
` Number two.`
` There are not many who could proudly choose to offer "the one you love" as a sacrifice.`
` Tell me your reason."`
`"Because the one you love will be lost eventually.`
` If you don't have anyone to love, you won't be hurt, and even then, you still might be able to love someone again someday.`
` So,`
` the person you love right now isn't worth that much at all nyeh.`
` ......Nihi!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` I see, so that is why you reach such an answer, you rabbit who has become cowardly because you have been hurt by love......`
` I have heard that rabbits die of loneliness, but just when was it that your heart was killed...?"`
`"Then, rabbit, I shall alter the question.`
` Why don't I change the second option to, not "the one you love", but "the memories of the one you loved"."`
`"......How is that?`
` Can you still select that one?`
` What's this about the one you love not being worth much at all, foolish rabbit...!"`
`"Filth who cannot even face up to the depths of her own love!!`
` Try and choose it, try and choose to have the one you loved forgotten!!!!!!"`
`"You can, right?`
` I'll bet you can, riiiiiiiight?`
` Cooooome onnnnn, try saying that you caa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaan!!!!"`
`"I, ...I, I can...`
` I can...!!`
` Nihi, .........nihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hiiihii......"`
`"L‐Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}...!`
` Please, have mercy on her......!!"`
`"Hihiiihiii...`
` ......Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinn...!!"`
`"That is enough, rabbit filth!!`
` Go to {f:5:Virgilia} and help keep watch on the dungeon.`
` Begone!!"`
`The Chiester Sisters, their old emotional wounds gouged,`
` disappeared as though running away.`
`After that, even though there was no one left to hear him, Kinzo continued talking as though continuing a play...`
`"......And there you have it, my pleasant test.`
` To be truthful, there is no choice that can be said to be correct."`
`"Whichever answer they choose, it is about whether they can choose...`
`without hesitation,`
` quickly,`
` and with a resolute conviction and their own strong, unshakable will!!"`
`"The reason and their willpower are more important.`
` .........That is what I want to know about.`
` Ahhh, descendants of mine, I am truly looking forward to what kind of answers you will show me!!"`
`"............Hmmmm?`
` Me?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Yes, of course I once had the same question thrust upon me.`
` Because I splendidly answered that devil's question, I was able to claim gold, honor, and that witch herself as my own."`
`"Which answer did I chooooose?`
` .........Do I really need to say it out loud?`
` Wahha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!!"`
`"So.`
` Have you decided on your answer......?"`
`"................................."`
`As Jessica stared at the crushed letter which lay on the floor,`
` ......she hung her head in constant silence.`
`All that filled the room was the sound of the wind and the rain, and the rustling of treetops.`
`{n}Regardless of how noisy that was, it simply made the silence more apparent.`
`Ronove waited for Jessica's answer.`
`{n}......However, Jessica didn't speak.`
`Whether she was deep in thought, or had stopped thinking, Ronove couldn't tell.`
`......No, ...he might actually have known.`
`But, cruelly like a demon, ......Ronove urged Jessica to voice it.`
`".........If you cannot choose any,`
` ......I can at least take your life painlessly, ...if you would like......?"`
`".................................`
` .........ll m."`
`"......What?`
` I'm afraid I had trouble hearing.`
` May I ask you to repeat......?"`
`Jessica lifted her face, ......and looked straight into Ronove's eyes.`
`......It seemed that she had decided on her answer.`
`"............Kill me."`
`Jessica said it one more time, ......clearly.`
`Perhaps Ronove had imagined from the very beginning that this would be the answer.`
`......Without any surprise, he smiled lightly and nodded.`
`"......I thought that you would choose that answer, Jessica‐sama.`
` ......Now then, there is no right or wrong answer to this test.`
` The important part is what thoughts led you to that answer."`
`"Come now.`
` Please answer that with your readiness as the next head."`
`"............It's not like I chose the first one 'cause I wanted to die.`
` ......The second one was letting Kanon‐kun die.`
` That's obviously out of the question.`
` So forget that one.`
` ......The third one was everyone else's lives.`
` That's also obviously out of the question.`
` So forget that one.`
` ......After that, only the first choice remained."`
`"Process of elimination, ......is it.`
` So it was not something you chose proactively, you say......"`
`After chuckling slightly, Ronove dropped his gaze.`
`......A {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} couldn't even imagine what kind of answer a demon would have been hoping for.`
`......All she could understand was that this was apparently slightly below Ronove's expectations.`
`"......It's not a bad answer, but I must say, it's not a good one either.`
` ......I suppose I would call it a 60.`
` ......I'm a little disappointed."`
`"You're a pretty selfish bastard, telling me to answer with self‐confidence and then being disappointed when I do."`
`".........Apparently it was not only process of elimination.`
` ...Either way, it is a failing grade, ......but it seems that there is a little more to your thoughts.`
` Allow me to ask."`
`"I don't want to die.`
` ......So I didn't {i:want} to choose the first one—no one would.`
` ......People struggle as much as life will let them, 'cause they want to live in happiness.`
` So normally, the first choice should be impossible from the beginning."`
`".........However, you took that first choice.`
` You chose to throw away your own life.`
` Only that choice remained."`
`"I tried......thinking of the future that would come after choosing each one."`
`"......Hoh.`
` And what did you find...?"`
`"First, .........I tried letting Kanon‐kun die.`
` .........I tried to imagine the rest of my life after having abandoned the one I love."`
`"What kind of life was it...?"`
`"She was a horrible woman, who didn't deserve to live.`
` A shabby woman who forever lamented her own decision, and lived only to regret.`
` ......A horrible woman who would choose to live and abandon the person she loved... I could never forgive a woman like that.`
` ......I'd put an end to her myself."`
`"Heheh, how spirited.`
` .........In that case, could you not also have considered the third choice?"`
`"......Yeah.`
` I tried letting everyone but me and Kanon‐kun die.`
` ......There's no way Kanon‐kun would like me if I did that."`
`"And it was no good for me either... Although I had Kanon‐kun, all the lives I abandoned for that became a cross that I had to bear for my entire life.`
` ......And even Kanon‐kun was forced to bear that cross."`
`".........I'm not going to make a foolish choice just to force a cross on Kanon‐kun.`
` If there's a future me out there who would do something like that, .........she's unforgivable to me.`
` ...I'd put an end to that woman myself too."`
`Jessica had pictured it in her mind.`
`{n}The future her, beyond each of the three choices.`
`There were three Jessicas.`
`{n}......Of the three, two had regrets.`
`{n}Only one could hold her head high and smile at Kanon.`
`"......You know,`
` I once had the nerve to preach something to Kanon‐kun.`
` ......Something about trying to live life to the fullest."`
`"Live your life to the fullest.`
` ......Meaningful words.`
` That is a surprisingly difficult thing to do."`
`"So yeah.`
` I've got to hold my head high and show Kanon‐kun.`
` .........Show him a way of living where you can hold your head high, and look anyone in the eye with a full and guiltless smile."`
`"......Will Kanon be able to receive your self‐sacrifice?`
` Haven't you considered that your self‐centered decision might hurt him even more...?"`
`"That's why...I want to leave a message..."`
`"Hoh.`
` ......I will listen, but I am after all a demon.`
` ...I may not keep my promises..."`
`".........Keep it.`
` Your promise."`
`Jessica spoke that looking quite unconcerned.`
`She had asked the demon who was about to take her life to pass on a message, and she wasn't thinking for a moment that she would be betrayed.`
`......At that extremely innocent smile, Ronove closed his eyes lightly, and shrugged his shoulders.`
`"Hmph......`
` ......Very well.`
` So?`
` What shall I tell him...?"`
`‘......Tell Kanon‐kun...to live his life to the fullest.`
` ......No, that's not quite it.`
` Not his life...not {i:Kanon‐kun's} life.`
` ......Even now I can't get him to tell me his real name,`
` but tell him to live the real Kanon‐kun's life to the fullest.`
` .........Tell him that.’`
`"...............Mi...lady......"`
`"......Jessica......`
` ......You are unbelievable............"`
`"Ronove is fickle, so he might not have passed the message on.`
` ......Aren't you lucky?`
` To have me here showing you this scene."`
`A musty three‐sided mirror was set beyond the bars, ......and the scene with Jessica was reflected on it.`
`On the next mirror...the scene with George was reflected in the same way.`
`None of them questioned how a three‐sided mirror had appeared from a group of butterflies,`
` or why Jessica and George were reflected on it.`
`......Because the reflected sights themselves were more important.`
`"............You are that prepared...`
`......to throw your life away,`
` ......for his sake........."`
`".................................`
` ......My......deepest apologies..."`
`Krauss looked at Kanon with a complicated expression that had an awkward smile mixed in.`
`{n}......Kanon couldn't meet his eyes.`
`"......{f:5:Virgilia}‐sama.`
` ......There is no reason for Milady to lose her life.`
` ......Please kill me.`
` Please change it to the second choice.`
` ......That way, everything should resolve itself."`
`"Hohhohohohohoho...`
` I am not capable of granting that wish.`
` ......After all, this is Jessica's own decision, which she chose."`
`Suddenly, the air split, and the Chiester Sisters appeared, flying into {f:5:Virgilia}'s chest.`
`"{f:5:Virgilia}‐samaaaaaaaaaaaa!`
` Hiieeehheiiiiih!!"`
`"So mean, so mean, Lord {f:5:Goldsmith} is so meeeeeaan, wahhhn{0}haaaan{0}haahaahhhn!"`
`"I'm......doing the best I can......`
` Crushing me for animal fodder...that's just too much.`
` ......Uuuuuuuughhuhhuu!!"`
`Still without a clue what was going on, {f:5:Virgilia} was smothered by the sobbing Chiester Sisters.`
`"Th‐there, there. Everything's alright, it's alright. Don't cry, don't cry......`
` I'll make you some delicious tea......"`
`"......I'm leaving it up to all of you to guard this place.`
` If they do anything suspicious, inform me immediately...!"`
`The goat attendants all looked at each other, and nodded their heads.`
`{f:5:Virgilia} took the Chiester Sisters and left.`
`The sound of people going up a set of stairs could be heard, so they had probably gone to an upper floor.`
`".........This is our chance.`
` ......These goat‐heads seem to be stupid.`
` ......I wonder if we can trick them..."`
`Kyrie realized that an opportunity had arrived, but she still hadn't thought of a way to break the metal bars......`
`The Jessica reflected on the three‐sided mirror closed her eyes, as though she had given up.`
`......The way she had both hands stuck into her pockets, wanting to be defiant until the very end, might have been her own kind of aesthetics.`
`"............That's all I want to say.`
` .........Kill me."`
`"......Very well.`
` ............Here we go, then.`
` ......Do not worry, for I shall make your death more gentle and merciful than any sleep."`
`Ronove raised his palm......as he slowly approached Jessica......`
`"Dammiiiiiiiiiiittt!!`
` Wrooggh!!`
` Graaah!!"`
`Realizing that his daughter would be killed, Krauss repeatedly body‐slammed the metal bars, going half‐mad.`
`The goats looked like they were sneering at how a mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} didn't stand a chance at breaking those bars.`
`And, true, Krauss's pointless effort might have been comical.`
`......But Krauss was giving it everything he had.`
` As Jessica's father, he was living in that moment with everything he had, so that he could save her.`
`.........Kanon made tight fists with both hands.`
`If he used his cursed power, he might be able to cut through even metal bars.`
`......But there were a full three goats.`
` ...There was no way he could defeat three of them in an instant.`
` It would instantly be reported, and then {f:5:Virgilia} and even the Chiester Sisters would dash in.`
`Though he may be able to break the bars, ......he could do nothing more.`
`{n}......It was useless.`
`......Kanon knew already that the witch was sneering at that kind of useless effort,`
` ......so he could do nothing but stare at Krauss's repeated body‐slams...`
`"......Ah, ............George‐sama......"`
`Shannon, who had been looking at the three‐sided mirror, let out a voice.`
`...They looked to see that George, who had been silent this whole time, had raised his head.`
`{n}......It seemed that George had also decided on an answer...`
`"............Have you decided?`
` Your answer?"`
`"Yeah.`
` .........I've decided."`
`"Is that an unwavering answer...?"`
`"Yeah. It's unwavering."`
`"Then let's hear it.`
` .........Oh, by the way,`
` it seems Jessica decided to take the "your life" option.`
` I hope that an indecisive person like you won't simply say you chose the same answer......?"`
`"......Jessica gave her own answer.`
` ......No matter which choice that was, it was Jessica's answer.`
` It does not influence my answer in any way."`
`"I see.`
` Then let me ask again.`
` ............Among the three mentioned below.`
` In order to gain two, sacrifice one."`
`"1. Your life.`
` {nobr:2. Shannon's} life.`
` {nobr:3. Everyone} else's lives.`
` .........Which have you chosen?`
` Could it be the first one, like Jessica?"`
`".........No."`
`"Oh......?"`
`Gaap looked a little surprised.`
` ......Because she had thought that a timid‐looking man like this would never choose any other option.`
`".....................`
` ......That's nice to hear.`
` I'm glad the most boring option for me has been removed.`
` ......Then, it seems unlikely, but......is it the second?`
` Can you abandon Shannon's life......?"`
`".........You must be joking.`
` Why would I do that to the person I'm going to give an engagement ring to tonight?"`
`"........................`
` .........Now this is bold.`
` Is that your answer......?"`
`".........Yes.`
` ......My answer...`
`...is the third choice."`
`George had chosen.........the third choice.`
`{n}......“Everyone else's lives”.`
`Even Gaap hadn't been able to imagine that answer.`
`......She had been sure that he'd choose number one, just like Jessica......`
`{n}So, she became interested in how he had reached that answer.`
`......How he had reached an answer that had defied the imagination of the 33rd ranked demon of the 72.`
`"I want you to tell me.`
` .........Tell me the perspective that makes you able to sacrifice the lives of everyone else so that you and the fiancée you love will be safe.`
` ......Process of elimination, like Jessica?"`
`"No.`
` This is the clear and only choice for me."`
`"...............So it's "I'm alright, Jack"?`
` You can sacrifice the world for the woman you love...?"`
`"Just what are you talking about?"`
`"............What.........?"`
`George faced the demon as he spoke, looking at her almost in disbelief.`
`"......Tonight,`
` I planned on calling Shannon to this very spot, and giving her this ring as proof of our engagement."`
`".........There probably are quite a few people who wouldn't celebrate an engagement between me and Shannon.`
` I was prepared to make enemies of the entire family by announcing my engagement to her."`
`"I have been prepared.`
` Since the time I came to this island, .........no, that's not it.`
` .........Since the time I confessed to her that I wanted us to get engaged."`
`"............So, you can sacrifice everything else as long as you can get married......?"`
`"Marriage...`
`...means remaining an ally to your wife for your entire life.`
` .........As of that moment,`
` ......I was prepared to make the entire world my enemy for her sake."`
`Those words, through the three‐sided mirror, ......also reached Shannon's ears.`
`{n}And his determination reached her eyes.`
`......Shannon certainly had arranged with George that tonight, she would be given an engagement ring.`
`Then this incident had occurred, and she hadn't been able to receive the ring.`
`But now,`
` .........even though it wasn't in the form of a ring,`
` ......Shannon had received something even greater.`
`......And as proof of that,`
` ......a single tear with the same sparkle as a diamond...`
`dripped down.`
`"Heh, ......heheheheheheh......!`
` What a gutsy answer.`
` .........Yes, if I really think about it, this was an easy decision for you."`
`"After all, your parents were already killed on the first twilight, right?`
` By now, there's no one whose death would bother you.`
` Hahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha, I see, this was an easy choice.`
` Ahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha......"`
`"You can say whatever you want.`
` This is my determination and my choice, ......personally, and as the next family head."`
`The sparkle in George's eyes was brilliant and sharp.`
`...For just an instant, Gaap felt the same sense of intimidation that Kinzo exuded, and was slightly overpowered.`
`".........I see.`
` ......So, the same answer as {f:5:Goldsmith}......`
` ......Despite your innocent face, ......you're going to become a terrible demon in the future.`
` ......What do you know, we might get along pretty well."`
`"You will succeed {f:5:Goldsmith}.`
` And maybe one day, I may even be summoned eventually and serve you.`
` ......That might be surprisingly interesting.`
` .........Heheh."`
`Gaap needed to change her opinion of George.`
`......This man bore a determination and resolve unimaginable from his outward appearance, and had not adopted that just now,`
` ......but had possessed it since the very beginning.`
`"I am prepared to inherit the headship right away.`
` .........No, that's not it.`
` You told me to think as the head in this test.`
` So I answered based on the premise that I am the head."`
`".........No, even that's not it.`
` I thought as the head himself.`
` ......Right now...I {i:am} the head of the Ushiromiya family."`
`".......................................`
` Ehheheheheh......`
` I'm impressed... I didn't expect you to be able to say so much."`
`"It seems you really are one to be reckoned with.`
` ......Battler's and Maria's tests haven't been done yet, but if you ask me, I think you should be the one to pass.`
` ............But only if that is your true, unexaggerated answer, of course?"`
`"............Do you doubt my resolve?"`
`"Can you carry out the choice you chose?`
` Can you, right now, with your own hands, offer all the lives that exist on this island as sacrifices......?`
` With your own hands, I remind you...?"`
`"I can.`
` I've said several times that I have that resolve."`
`"Ha, ............hahahahahaha!`
` Then return to the guesthouse right away, and kill Battler and Maria!`
` When that is done, I will bring you the other hostages.`
` Execute each of them except Shannon before her eyes!`
` You can do it, right?!"`
`"{i:I can}.`
` My resolve is on a whole different level from yours."`
`"...........................mngh.`
` Then carry it out!`
` Death for them all!`
` Carry out this blood‐stained ritual as the new head of the Ushiromiya family...!!"`
`"......Understood.`
` I'll carry it out.`
` I am already the head of the Ushiromiya family."`
`"Yes, that's right!`
` Stain that throne red by your own hands...!`
` You will become king of the netherworld, ruler of all demons...!!"`
`Gaap was now sure.`
`{n}This man was truly fitting to succeed Kinzo's madness...!`
`"Rage on, storm! Cry out, thunder!!`
` Celebrate the birth of the new demon king!!`
` The island of demons has now welcomed a new ruler...!!"`
`In response to the demon's call, the tempest raged more and more.`
`Then a massive lightning bolt fell, its tearing thunder and brilliant light creating the feeling of just a moment of silence......`
`"So,`
` ............about the order of the murders.`
` I get to choose, right?"`
`"Please, as you wish, Your Majesty, the new demon king of Rokkenjima.`
` As your heart desires...!"`
`".........Well, for lack of a better option...`
`the first one will be you, then—I hope that won't be a problem?"`
`"..............................Huh?"`
`A gust of wind blew, ......stirring up George's jacket as though it was a cloak.`
`It was very much like the cloak worn by the head.`
`{n}It definitely gave the same impression of grandeur......`
`......At that time, ......Gaap certainly saw the storm wiped away, and the sky covered with a pure‐white and vast full moon.`
`Bearing the full moon on his back,`
` the man who called himself the new head...`
`sneered at the demon.`
`"Even the lives of the Ushiromiya family, all of them......are now my fortune.`
` There will be reparations to be made for the damage that has been done to that fortune.`
` It won't be cheap."`
`"......You didn't seriously think you could take the lives of my parents, Aunt Natsuhi, Uncle Rudolf, Auntie Rosa,`
` and Genji‐san, and hope I'd overlook it, right?"`
`"Ho...`
`......hohoh...`
`............you little wise guy......"`
`Ronove had been intending to press his palm against Jessica's chest and stop her heart.`
`But a short distance away, his hand had stopped......`
`......On the carpet at their feet,`
` ......plop, plop...small red flowers bloomed one after another.`
`The seeds of those flowers...`
`...had fallen down from high, high above,`
` .........all the way from Jessica's fist,`
` ...held up as though to strike the heavens.`
`Ronove's nose was stained red with spurting blood,`
` ......and those drops were dripping onto the carpet.`
`".........By the way, that just now was my answer as a maiden.`
` ......My answer as the next head is different."`
`"Allow me to ask......"`
`"......The person I love, my family and my relatives, everyone, everyone!!`
` I'll protect them.`
` If I'm the head, then that's my duty!"`
`"Dad wasn't just acting self‐important.`
` He was protecting me and Mom!!`
` ......Fighting the pressure of succeeding the Ushiromiya family......for several decades!!"`
`"So I know.`
` ......Being the successor is nothing trivial.`
` ......So you know what?`
` This is easy as hell.`
` ......It's easy as hell for me to risk my own life!!"`
`Jessica knew.`
`She knew that her father, in order to protect his family, was even now bluffing and fighting a solitary fight.`
`Jessica understood something that his back had been telling her!`
`Another left straight was buried into Ronove's face.`
`{n}......That mighty strike wasn't due just to the brass knuckles she was using.`
`It was a strike...`
`of a person, a family head, who could throw away everything in order to protect.`
`"If Dad's lost his qualifications to be the successor,`
` then I, the next in line, will succeed the headship.`
` ......Head of the Ushiromiya family, Ushiromiya Jessica!!`
` I'm not enough of a wimp to let you keep on doing whatever the fuck you want!!"`
`"............A wonderful answer.`
` I shall change your score from earlier.`
` Plus 10 for that answer.`
` ......Plus 10 for that splendid left straight."`
`"Which means I only need plus 20 more for a perfect 100?"`
`Ronove backflipped away from her, and violently wiped away the blood pouring from his nose.`
`......It had become, not blood, but petals of a red rose.`
`The blood on his face was wiped off, ......and in its place...`
`was a grin from a great delight, which he had last felt so many centuries ago that he could no longer remember just how long it had been.`
`"Your resolve.`
` I, Ronove, will test to see whether it is deserving of full marks......"`
`"Cram it, jackass!!`
` Come at meeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"`
`"Come, to the Abyss...!"`
`"Wwagh?!"`
`Beneath George's feet, a pitch‐black pit suddenly opened its mouth wide.`
`{n}Of course, George had no way of resisting.`
`After being swallowed up by it, George fell out of a pitch‐black hole that had opened up in the ceiling of the arbor.`
`As George fell down,`
` he was hit sharply in the gut, like a precision bee‐strike, by a reverse roundhouse kick from a stiletto heel...!`
`Launched out of the arbor, the instant George thought that he was about to be swallowed up by a rose bush...`
`...another pitch‐black hole opened there and swallowed George up.`
`And this time, a pitch‐black hole opened in front of Gaap at her feet, spitting a defenseless George out of it.`
`......By that time, Gaap had already finished the preparatory motions for the next reverse roundhouse kick.`
`"Ghh, ......what is......this..."`
`"Welcome back. *giggle*!"`
`Right side of the head.`
` Below the right armpit.`
` Side of the right knee.`
`As Gaap danced and spun like a small cyclone,`
` she kept hitting him, {nobr:right foot} {nobr:left foot} {nobr:right foot} {nobr:left foot}, with successive roundhouse kicks.`
`The fourth one became a sweep, cutting George's feet out from under him and making him fall down,`
` but of course, there was no floor there, but a pitch‐black hole, and George was swallowed up once again.`
`Gaap once again spun around like a small cyclone.`
`{n}George, likewise, was once again spat out from the ceiling of the arbor.`
`".........Take this and keep it as a memento, the single strike at the end of the Abyss.`
` ......Die......!!"`
`The sharp strike of the queen bee pierced the heavens like a rising cyclone.`
`{n}It kicked through George's abdomen as he fell from the ceiling......`
`And then, ......time froze.`
` George was pinned in midair by Gaap's raised leg......`
`"Gah, .........mmph........."`
`Still pinned in midair, George moaned......`
`Then Gaap, with George still hung up on her foot,`
` ......grinned.`
`".........I'll admit it.`
` Your attitude at least is mature.`
` But that's no good if it doesn't come along with power."`
`"......Did you know?`
` They say you need three kinds of power to rule this world.`
` The first is influence.`
` The second is wealth.`
` Do you know what the last one is?"`
`"I read it in a book.`
` ......Force, right......?"`
`"Correct.`
` That is what you are lacking."`
`Gaap finally released George.`
`By kicking him upwards one more time, adding in another roundhouse kick and smashing him into a pillar.`
`"Ghh? ......Ung...uhhhgh......!"`
`"No one will fear a monarch without influence, without wealth, or without force."`
`"Kinzo possessed all three.`
` That is why he reigned as a tyrant!`
` ......If you're going to call yourself Kinzo's successor, try showing me some of his majesty!"`
`"......Come on, how long are you going to lie there?`
` Stand up.`
` If you don't, you'll {i:fall} again, see?"`
`"Pu ku ku ku.`
` Not bad movements.`
` But I feel they are somewhat unsuitable for a lady."`
`"Asshooooooooole!!`
` Ducking and weaving and hopping around!!`
` Aren't you gonna fight back......?! Quit jerking me around, you douche!!"`
`Ronove was dodging skillfully, jumping back, and avoiding Jessica's fists,`
` but he still wasn't striking back himself.`
`Because of his agile movements, as swift as a flag whipping around in strong winds, Jessica's fist wasn't even able to touch him.`
`Amidst a feeling of her blood running hot, Jessica regained her offensive composure.`
`Even though this room was large for a bedroom, it was too small an area to keep up such exaggerated dodges for long.`
`......She calmly realized that, and started using not just her fists, but her legs as well.`
`"......Hoh.`
` ......Doing boxing with just your arms makes you but half a man.`
` Your arms must be the roaring lion, burning with power.`
` And your legs the snake, cold as ice as it closes in on its prey."`
`"Snakes don't have legs!"`
`"Pu ku ku, very true."`
`Jessica began cornering Ronove towards the wall with perfect footwork.`
` She wouldn't let him get around her.`
`......Ronove's magnificent dodges looked flashy, but they needed sufficient room.`
`Once cornered, he wouldn't be able to dodge anymore...!`
`Jessica had a good understanding of the special characteristics of her equipped weapon, the brass knuckles.`
`This powerful weapon's most notable characteristic was how it didn't let the opponent defend.`
`Even if they blocked with their arm, that arm would receive direct damage.`
`{n}......If it hit the wrong way, it might even break the bone.`
`So she pressed him forward.`
` She would block off his escape routes, ......and then, with this fist, she would chip this demon down!!`
`"Whoops...!`
` Oh my, when did...?"`
`"Looks like I've finally cornered you, huh......?`
` Where is everyone being held?`
` Where's that old bastard hiding?`
` You tell me everything, and I'll let you go with nothing more than ripping that mustache off, alright?"`
`"That would be a problem.`
` Believe it or not, it does take me an hour every morning to set this, you see."`
`"If I put you in a plaster cast, I guess you won't even be able to do that!"`
`"............Oops‐a‐daisy.`
` .....................gggh."`
`Ronove had blocked Jessica's lunged fist with his arm.`
`{n}He tried to act as though it was no big deal, but it must have hurt a lot.`
`......Jessica grinned.`
`{n}Ronove smiled the same way, but twitched slightly.`
`"......I see.`
` This certainly does hurt."`
`"Final warning.`
` Break down and apologize."`
`"That, I cannot do.`
` It would ruin my image."`
`"Then just break.`
` Flurry of puncheeeeeeeees!!!"`
`Jessica's iron fists were pounded into Ronove.`
`But Jessica was startled—the impact felt wrong, and there was the sound of breaking glass.`
`"Wh‐......?!"`
`At a glance, it looked like Ronove had caught Jessica's fist with his palm.`
` ......That wasn't quite true.`
`When Ronove opened his hand, a faint purple glowing barrier like a glass shield appeared there,`
` stopping the attack by a hair's breadth.`
`Pulling herself together, Jessica struck out with her fists again, but with truly magnificent movements, Ronove caught all of them......`
`"I am, after all, a demon.`
` I am at least capable of this level of magic.`
` .........I must say, though, you are quite good.`
` If I were a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, I am sure that this is where I would have admitted defeat.`
` It is because I am a demon that I can still continue to fight."`
`"Y‐......you frigging cheater.........!"`
`"Is that all?`
` ......Are you sure that by attacking all the time, you are not neglecting your own defense?"`
`"Huh?!"`
`"......Waaah!!"`
`Ronove pounded his palm into Jessica's stomach, stopping abruptly just a fraction away.`
`Jessica was repelled by the purple shield, tumbled backwards, and smashed her head on the bed.`
`"My shield cannot be broken by a mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` I suggest that you never again dream of being able to touch my body."`
`"......In that case, ......I'll just punch straight through that shield......!!"`
`"You are a dauntless person.`
` That tenacity...yes, it is truly fitting for the next family head.`
` ......Why don't I be your opponent for just a while longer.`
` This is one of the privileges of an examiner.`
` .........Pukku{0}ku{0}ku{0}ku{0}kuku!"`
`"SHATTER TO PIECEEEEEEEES, IIIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!"`
`Gaap looked down on George, sneering.`
`{n}He was lying face‐down in a puddle on the rose garden path.`
`The merciless rain beat down on him, so that it looked as though even the heavens were mocking him...`
`".........Ahhahahahahahaha.`
` Stand up.`
` You'll fall again."`
`"..........................."`
`George stood up shakily.`
`......It seemed his spirit hadn't given in, but the damage to his body was fairly significant.`
`"Beg for your life.`
` What you're doing now is the same as the fourth choice of choosing nothing.`
` ......You chose the third choice, right?`
` If you get down on your hands and knees and apologize, I'll forgive your rudeness towards me."`
`"Then, I'll guide you down to the dungeon.`
` There, for your beloved Shannon and your own powerless self, you will kill the other hostages one by one."`
`"......You can do it, right?`
` You did boast about having that resolve.`
` ......Heheheheheh."`
`George didn't answer.`
`{n}......But his gaze was still obstinately resisting surrender.`
`"......If you are too obstinate, then this time you really will fall to the deepest depths of the Abyss...`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`Gaap's strength was undeniable.`
`......There was no doubt that Shannon's group, watching through the three‐sided mirror, understood that—`
`probably even more clearly than George himself...`
`".........George‐sama......`
` ......Please,`
` ......that's enough.........`
` ...You don't have to do this for someone like me......"`
`"Nee‐san......"`
`"......If you didn't fall in love with me,`
` ......you wouldn't have to fight with anyone, right, George‐sama...?`
` Then please, just abandon me......`
` Please, forget me......"`
`There was no way for that voice to reach George.`
`......But, even so,`
` ......George answered.`
`"No way.`
` ............I won't...surrender."`
`"......Oh?`
` Why......?"`
`"............Because that...is my...resolve.`
` ......I'll fight everything for Shannon's sake.`
` And I'll make everything accept us,`
` ......and everything bless us."`
`"Hey, tell me something.`
` How can you go so far for that furniture called Shannon?`
` .........She's just a good‐for‐nothing, isn't she?`
` Furniture for the garbage that doesn't even make for a satisfactory waitress."`
`"............I won't permit any more insults against the woman I love."`
`"So what are you going to do about it?`
` How is a weak kiddo like you going to fight against me...?"`
`"Loving someone is strength.`
` ......I was able to become strong because I learned that feeling.`
` .........‘Shannon,`
` I love you.’`
` With just those words, I can stand back up, over and over again."`
`"Shannon's in the dungeon, you know?`
` No good professing your love to me."`
`"No.`
` She heard.`
` ......Because that is love.`
` Shannon can hear my words right now.`
` The reason I can believe that...is because of love."`
`"..................This guy... ......"`
`‘Shannon.`
` You are not furniture.`
` ......Even if you were, you would be mine alone, the only furniture for me in the world.`
` I want you to be close to me all my life.`
` ......I need you...always and forever.’`
`".........G‐......George‐sama..............."`
`"......I'm jealous.`
` He's surpassed my husband in smooth talking."`
`"Th‐......this is youth."`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` Love is strength?`
` Then why are you so weak, boy?`
` It must mean your love is also that weak, then, I guess?"`
`"*snicker*snicker*!`
` Your love for your fiancée is weak.`
` Your parents' disappointingly quick deaths were weak.`
` Everything about your life is weak."`
`"...............Shannon taught me about love and strength.`
` If you insist upon measuring my love for Shannon by my strength alone,`
` ......then let me teach you about my love."`
`"*chuckle*, nice words.`
` ......Nowww I get it.`
` So you say that the way you can still stand up after being kicked down so many times is the strength you received from Shannon.`
` In that case, what did you receive from your mother and father, who were killed without a fight?`
` .........?"`
`Suddenly, there was a blackout.`
` ......Outside?`
`".........N‐......no.`
` .........Th‐...this is............"`
`The thing blocking Gaap's vision...`
`............was the bottom...`
`of George's...`
`...`
`shoe...`
`"............Side kick.`
` Nasal bone fractured."`
`It had stopped right in front of the tip of Gaap's nose.`
`"The thing I got from Mother was this kick."`
`After several moments' delay, Gaap jumped back.`
` Of course, it was too late.`
`If George hadn't stopped, he probably would have caused exactly the damage he had announced.`
`"And what I got from Father...`
`...is patience."`
`Anger with a low boiling point isn't something to be truly feared.`
`{n}......True anger is cultivated through patience.`
`".........I understand your declaration of violent intent.`
` ......I also understand your defamation of my fiancée and my parents.`
` And you have no intention of retracting any of these......?"`
`"......Y‐you......"`
`"I have a sufficient understanding of your attacks now.`
` ............If you're ready...may I fight back?"`
`"E‐enough of your slick talk, bucko......!!"`
`A pitch‐black hole opened its mouth at George's feet.`
`But George rapidly opened his legs, straddling the hole.`
` The same move wouldn't work again...!`
`It was an extremely light dodge, and the upper part of his body didn't even quiver.`
`"Patience means not losing your cool, and instead composedly researching your opponent's moves.`
` .........For what purpose?`
` Isn't it obvious?`
` Do you know?"`
`"N‐n‐no I don't......"`
`"It's to counter, to give back exactly what you got, to make them never want to mess with you again,`
` to make them cover their face in tears and snot and forget to wipe it off,`
` to make them want to rub their forehead on the ground and apologize over and over—to completely, perfectly, thoroughly...!!!`
` ......Pulverize them until they can't get up."`
`George dashed.`
`Pits opened one after another, but George would not step in them again.`
`And because she persisted in that move, Gaap was captured for a second time...`
`".........Reverse roundhouse.`
` Jaw fractured."`
`"...............!"`
`It was stretched out more forcefully and beautifully than Gaap's had been.`
`Of course, while it centered directly on Gaap's face, it stopped a hair's breadth away.`
`Perhaps she couldn't rely on pitfalls at this close range.`
`Gaap kicked at George's shins as a diversion,`
` and in the instant of weakness when he tried to deal with that, she aimed a kick at his stomach.`
`It was a bee‐like stab by her stiletto heel.`
`......But it sliced through the air where George was no longer.`
`".........High axe kick.`
` Collarbone fractured."`
`"............wh‐uh—"`
`From beside Gaap,`
` George coldly announced that, his foot still raised.`
`If that monarch's heel had been swung down, a collarbone fracture would have been an understatement.`
`"This guy's...`
`......stronger than me...at close range......?!`
` Need distance......"`
`She jumped backwards to gain a large distance.`
`She jumped and jumped and leapt and even backflipped, increasing the distance between them.`
`It should have been magnificent, but for some reason, it looked very similar to the movements of a small, scared animal.`
`If she opened the distance, she could fight at the range that was her specialty, using a mixture of pitfalls and kicking techniques...!`
`"You fool... Regret the arrogance of passing on three chances to defeat me, in the depths of the Abyss!!`
` ..................Huh?"`
`Gaap landed beautifully and tried to aim a pitfall,`
` when a razor‐sharp wind cut her bangs.`
` ...Yes, cut them.`
`And twice.`
` ......This time it didn't just stop a hair's breadth away, but scattered her bangs with its air pressure......`
`".........Armada com martelo.`
` ......Orbital blowout fracture with the first strike.`
` Cerebral contusion with the second strike."`
`"..................{m:-5:——}—...!!!"`
`Gaap was too shocked to speak.`
`George had closed all that distance in an instant, and let off a fearsomely nimble midair double kick.`
`......Furthermore, with the accuracy and edge of a razor, it had cut nothing more than a few of her bangs.`
`"I learned the power of kicks from karate,`
` speed from tae kwon do,`
` and freedom of range from capoeira."`
`"......Mother was always trying something new.`
` But it was very educational being able to study their various merits."`
`"Wh‐......why don't you hit......?`
` ......Because I'm a woman?!!"`
`"......You spoke of force as a monarch's third power."`
`"It looks like you're still mistaking the meaning of that force.`
` ......In this situation, force doesn't mean hastily wielded violence.`
` .........It refers to a deterrent—the knowledge that if someone opposes the monarch, that person won't get away unharmed."`
`"A deterrent......?"`
`That was the point.`
` That was why all of George's attacks up until then had stopped just before the blow.`
`These bare misses, which were more difficult than hitting directly, had all been performed so splendidly.`
`...And any one of them would probably have crushed Gaap in a single hit, if George had wished it.`
`He was—deliberately—not doing that.`
`"You said it yourself, right?`
` Force is the power to rule.`
` .........If you destroy your opponent with force, you won't be able to rule them, right?"`
`"A monarch's force is something that is only shown.`
` He does not destroy.`
` ......He makes others submit, and adds them to his own fortune.`
` If you black out on me, I won't be able to make you guide me to where everyone is being held."`
`Gaap had to admit it.`
`She had to admit that George understood force in the truest sense...!`
`"You'll take me to where everyone is.`
` I would advise against resisting.`
` .........I won't hold back anymore."`
`"...khh...!!`
` .........Sorry, Lia... Lemme borrow your troops.`
` This guy's too much for me alone to handle!!"`
`As a large, pitch‐black hole opened in the sky,`
` thunk, thunk, thunk—three muscular goat attendants fell out.`
` They surrounded George.`
`".........Reinforcements?`
` I wonder if I should take this to mean that you retract your statement about me being weak."`
`"I, ......I admit it.`
` ......I made light of your power...the power of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s......"`
`"No.`
` This is the strength of a man who has come to know love."`
`"Wh‐what tripe... How can you say stuff like that with a straight face?!!`
` Come, goats!`
` Crush this man into meatballs!"`
`"Heheheh, these goats are stupid, but it looks like they at least have power.`
` I'll make it so that even your fiancée won't be able to recognize your corpse!"`
`"You refuse to surrender and intend to continue fighting. Understood.`
` ......I proclaim that henceforth, you will receive real harm proportional to your own attacks."`
`"If you still plan on attacking me, I suggest you prepare to receive a great deal of damage."`
`When George proclaimed that,`
` ......a faint red magic circle rose up around him.`
`But it seemed that George couldn't see it.`
`{n}However, Gaap, being a demon, could.`
`"M‐......magic?!`
` Why does this guy have a defensive barrier...?!`
` And what's more, it's......specialized for counterattacks...?!`
` Is this......wh‐what you meant by a deterrent......?!"`
`From a demon's perspective, that might have been magic.`
`But in George's eyes, it was...determination.`
`It was absolute determination that would show no mercy to anyone who wished for further fighting,`
` and force them to prepare for a significant counterattack.`
` Absolute determination...becomes magic.`
`Ronove had been accurately blocking Jessica's fists with the shield.`
` ......But something felt odd.`
`Even though he was certainly stopping the blows with the shield,`
` he felt his arm beginning to strain and ache.`
`All physical damage should have been shut off.`
`......However, the damage from her fists was gradually being transmitted to his arm, and was accumulating.`
`Ronove acted like he was composed, so that this wouldn't be noticed...`
`"Heh, heheh...!!`
` I'm not gonna get worn out.`
` What's wrong, old man?`
` Starting to get a little tough...?!"`
`"......No matter how much you attack, it is useless.`
` Why can't you understand that you cannot break my shield?"`
`"Saying that is not gonna stop me hitting you.`
` ......No matter how hard someone's heart is, words are gonna get through to them a little bit each time, and eventually, you can make a crack...!`
` I believe it!!`
` I believe that there's no such thing as useless effort in this world!!"`
`"Isn't that why we live?! To the fullest!!`
` If words get through eventually, then the same goes for fists...!!`
` I don't even know the meaning of the words "give up"!!"`
`Those words were probably aimed at Kanon...`
` Kanon had, technically, rejected Jessica's words.`
` ......But Jessica knew that, no matter how obstinate his heart was, those words would eventually soak through.`
`And she believed that surely, the day would come when he would understand her heart, and stop calling himself furniture and disparaging himself,`
` ......and step out into his new life.`
`So Jessica wouldn't give up.`
` She wouldn't lose heart...!`
`"Sounds dumb as hell, huh?`
` I'll bet it makes no sense to a guy like you, does it?`
` See, a girl in love...doesn't even think about "giving up because it's useless"!!"`
`At that time, Ronove certainly saw.`
`{n}He saw the red‐hot burning glow of light surround Jessica's fists.`
`".........This is......problematic.`
` ......Enchanted, are they?`
` ...Permeation upgrade......that will be troublesome."`
`Within her relentless fists and determination...dwelled the power to succeed no matter what.`
`{n}From a demon's perspective, that was magic.`
` Absolute determination...becomes magic.`
`"See?`
` Nothing useless about it.`
` ...My fists are making it through, aren't they?`
` You're guarding your arm, old man."`
`"...............It seems I will have to get a little more serious.`
` ...It appears it is as you said.`
` ......In this world, nothing is useless."`
`"That's right...!`
` If you give up saying something's useless, that's when your life is frigging over...!`
` I'll get through to him.`
` ......Definitely...!!"`
`I'm an idiot, so this is the only way I can live,`
` but even so, ......I believe that one day,`
` I'll definitely be able to teach Kanon‐kun about a new world!!`
`So I'm not gonna buckle in a place like this...!!`
`{n}I'll definitely defeat you,`
` and save everyone!!`
`"Dammit!!`
` If I could just...open a hole......aaaaaaaargghhh!!!"`
`Krauss was repeating his useless effort in trying to somehow open a hole between the metal bars.`
`......Useless.`
` .........There's nothing useless.`
`{n}There's nothing...`
`The lookout goats had been swallowed up by those black pits and disappeared.`
`......Now was their do‐or‐die chance.`
`This was their only chance to break the bars......`
`"S‐stop it, it's impossible, Krauss‐san!`
` We can't do anything about them with our bare hands!`
` Let's look for a tool, don't waste time on the impossible...!"`
`"If you give up saying it's useless, then it's all over...that's what my daughter said.`
` ......Even if it's impossible for my body, as long as a small person like Shannon or Kanon could make it through......!!"`
`"......At this stage, action is more important than racking our brains.`
` Let's put our strength together, I'll join in too...!`
` ......Kanon‐kun, you're a boy, lend a hand...!`
` ......Kanon‐kun?!"`
`"............Krauss‐sama.`
` Please stand back."`
`"What?`
` What are you thinking of......?"`
`"......It's alright, isn't it, Nee‐san?`
` .........If we try struggling...just one more time."`
`"............Yeah.`
` ......I'll...struggle once more as well.`
` ......No, not once.`
` ...Over and over again."`
`Jessica's voice had reached Kanon.`
`{n}It had certainly permeated into his stone‐cold heart.`
`And George's voice had reached Shannon.`
` If the love he had shown was embodied by strength, she would have to respond in the same way.`
`An incredible metallic sound rang out.`
`.........The first flash cut horizontally through several of the metal bars, and with the next flash, they were cut through horizontally again,`
` causing them to clatter to the ground like bamboo shoots cut by a sword.`
`Krauss, Kyrie, and Nanjo didn't even have a clue about what had just happened......`
`"......Doctor Nanjo.`
` Which way down the corridor goes to the mansion......?"`
`"Y‐.........yes!`
` It's to the left at the back...to the left at the back......!"`
`"Let's go, everyone.`
` ......We'll be noticed by {f:5:Virgilia}‐sama any time now."`
`"You two...`
`......what in the world {i:are} you......?"`
`"............We're......"`
`When Kanon hung his head a little and faltered, Shannon slapped his shoulder, smiled, and spoke.`
`"We are {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}."`
`"V‐{f:5:Virgilia}‐sama!!`
` Response from warning network, jailbreak!`
` The goat guards aren't there for some reason...!!"`
`"......Whaaat?! Why?!`
` ...............It's Gaap, isn't it.`
` Taking my summons without asking!!`
` ......Gap!`
` Gapgap!!"`
`"......Confirming Rules of Engagement.`
` Request permission to fire at the escapees, ma'am."`
`"Do it...!`
` Kill them! {ruby:Grrrr:Kiiiiii}!!`
` Gapgapgap,`
` gab,`
` gya!!!"`
`"Understood, ma'am.`
` 45, 410, preparing for sniping pursuit combat.`
` Ammo type: Guided cluster rounds.`
` ......{f:5:Virgilia}‐sama, the escape prevention barrier."`
`"Owowowow......`
` Y‐yes, right.`
` Hohhoho, I won't let you escape from here.`
` ......Owow, bit my tongue saying Gapgap..."`
`As they ran down the underground passage, the path in front of them was once again blocked by metal bars.`
` The door was, of course, locked.`
`......However, that was no problem for them now.`
`"Kanon, more metal bars!`
` We need you...!"`
`"Yes, Krauss‐sama...!"`
`"......That is incredible, though.`
` ...I wonder if you could tell me what kind of principle it works on."`
`"I'm not interested in principles.`
` The only thing that's important is that he can sever the metal bars, and we can escape from here...!`
` Don't get distracted, Kanon, just do it!"`
`"Leave it to me......!"`
`Kanon sliced the metal bars again with a red trail.`
` But there was a harsh, strange noise, and only a slight scratch was left on the metal bars.`
`"G‐goodness,`
` ......these are sturdy......"`
`"No.`
` ......It's enchanted!`
` It's {f:5:Virgilia}‐sama's magic lock."`
`"Can you cut through it?"`
`"Of course.`
` But it will take time."`
`"I'll give you three minutes...!"`
`After taking a deep breath and focusing his concentration, Kanon once again extended his sword that trailed red.`
`When he pressed it hard against the metal bars, sparks sprayed, almost as though he was burning through them with a blowtorch.`
`"It looks like cutting it is possible, ......but it's going to make us work for it."`
`".........Krauss‐sama.`
` We've been locked on to by the enemy.`
` Please move back."`
`"Huh?`
` Pursuers?`
` There's no one coming!"`
`"Please get behind me.`
` They're aiming for us...!!"`
`"45, data received.`
` Targets acquired. Correcting for terrain.`
` Forming firing curve, control points adjusted.`
` Data link to 410."`
`"410, data received.`
` Checking danger zone, no problems."`
`"00, loading 48 sub‐rounds, individual homing F&F.`
` Guided cluster rounds: ready."`
`"45, firing preparations complete.`
` Guided cluster rounds: loaded."`
`"410, nihhihihihi!`
` Firiiing!!"`
`A golden arrow that sparkled gold was fired, leaving a gold tail streaming behind.`
`{n}It drew a curve, went through the door, through the keyhole, down the stairs, towards the underground path at full speed......!`
`"S‐something shone!!"`
`"......You can't block the golden arrow with a shield.`
` Kanon‐kun, prepare to intercept.`
` Let's link."`
`"Gatekeeper, understood.`
` .........It's been a long time since I've fought alongside you, Nee‐san.`
` Don't screw up."`
`"Yeah.`
` I'll give it everything I've got."`
`"Then we'll be fine!"`
`Kanon stopped cutting the bars, and stood in front of Shannon.`
`Behind him, Shannon closed her eyes, concentrating her mind, focusing deep, deep into the darkness of the underground path......`
`A guided cluster round is a special kind of arrow made up of 48 sub‐rounds bound together.`
`{n}It explodes mid‐flight and divides into 48 mini‐arrows.`
`The strength of each individual one is low, but they pierce through all shields and possess total lethality against ground troops.`
`And on top of that, each one of the 48 possesses autonomous guidance towards their individual targets.`
`".........It shone.`
` ...It's divided..."`
`"Checking guided cluster round division.`
` 46...7...8, ...48 sub‐rounds, all locks acquired.`
` Interception control. Data link to Kanon."`
`"Kanon, data received.`
` ......Your ability is incredible, Nee‐san.`
` I can {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} all 48."`
`"Observe the interception priority ordering.`
` Trust your nee‐san."`
`"Of course.`
` I don't even need to open my eyes."`
`"Commence interception."`
`"T‐targets unharmed!!`
` I‐it was intercepted...!!"`
`"Nihyah?!`
` All 48?!"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho......`
` Shannon and Kanon were originally a furniture pair, you see.`
` They're strong when they're together.`
` ...Owowow.`
` ...I wonder if this is going to become a mouth ulcer..."`
`"Calm down, reload.`
` ......Updating ammo type.`
` Precision light‐speed sniper rounds.`
` Prepare for precision sniping."`
`"Sounds good nyeh! Impossible to intercept super high‐speed rounds!`
` Impossible to defend against for a mere Gatekeeper nyeh!"`
`"Precision sniping understood.`
` Commencing collection of precision firing data........."`
`"Wh‐what in the world was that just now......?"`
`"Don't worry, I'm as clueless as you...`
` All I know is that we'd be dead if we hadn't relied on those two..."`
`"Kanon‐kun, thanks.`
` Go back to the metal bars.`
` Next will probably come a shot that you can't intercept."`
`"How do we block against such an attack...?!"`
`"We don't let them shoot.`
` ......Kanon‐kun, spirit particle combat, guard yourself."`
`At those words, Kanon closed his eyes tightly and clenched his teeth.`
`{n}......With Shannon at the center, a pressure and impact blasted out that could only be perceived by those not human.`
`"......Huh?!`
` Firing system error!!`
` No good, rebooting...`
` Huh, huh?!"`
`"Spirit wave jamming! Spirit particle protection, move it!`
` What are you doing, cover your ears, 45!!!"`
`An unseen, unheard impact blasted towards the Chiester Sisters.`
`00 and 410 crouched down, covering their ears...but 45 didn't make it in time.`
`......Still standing bolt upright, her eyes rolled inside her head.`
`"Ukyu...?!?!"`
`"...Kyuu? Kyuu!`
` Kyuu`
`kyuu`
`kyu~!!!"`
`"45, damaged...!`
` Her compiler engine's gone kaput...!!`
` ......U...gya, ......the noise...is horrible for me too nyeh......"`
`"45,`
` 410,`
` ......and 00,`
` damaged...`
` Abandoning sniping.`
` ......Ack, it came straight through the link......`
` H‐have to reboot..."`
`Raising their spirit particle sensitivity for precision sniping had backfired.`
`They had taken the full brunt of the spirit particle shock wave Shannon had released,`
` and not only 45, who had been hit directly, but also 00 and 410, who had been linked with her, were taken down.`
`"Are you alright?!`
` ......I'll make you some more delicious black tea later, okay? Hold together!"`
`"M‐......my apologies, ma'am......`
` We'll reboot.`
` Please wait a few hundred seconds......"`
`All of the Chiester Sisters collapsed.`
` They would probably get back up eventually, but it looked like it would be hard for them to return to the battle lines for a while.`
`"So, furniture was able to repel weapons, if for but a moment.`
` .........I see, the plots which entertain that child truly are filled with unexpected turns!"`
`{f:5:Virgilia} tore the air with a large motion as though opening a door.`
`"Come, arise, goat attendants...!`
` It's time for work.`
` Kill and capture the escapees.`
` Corpses are fine, we can just revive them anyway!"`
`A gold‐colored door opened in the air, and countless giant goats with muscular bodies peeked their faces out...`
`"Come now, hurry.`
` There are five escapees, so the fastest five of you win!`
` There will be a wonderful prize! Come on now, go for it, go for it!"`
`{f:5:Virgilia} clapped her hands, urging them on.`
`A prize?!`
` After glancing at each other at those words, the goats rushed to the door at once, trying to get out,`
` making the exit as tight a squeeze as the trains during the commuter rush.`
`Each wanted to get out first, so none of them could get out.`
`{n}......{f:5:Virgilia} held her head in frustration.`
`By that time, Kanon had managed to cut just enough bars to make a gap that could be slipped through.`
`It proved a bit of work for Krauss, large as he was, and Nanjo, whose waist was nearly his downfall, but even so, they all managed to make it through.`
`But their relief at getting through was short‐lived.`
`Immediately, another set of metal bars blocked the way in front of them.`
`"The security sure is tough.`
` ......I bet they really didn't want the people in here to escape."`
`"Kanon, sorry, but I'll have to ask you again.`
` ......I'm sure it's tough on you, but please...!"`
`There was sweat on Kanon's forehead.`
`You could tell at a glance that cutting the metal bars, which had been made even more solid by magic, was exhausting him considerably.`
`"......Yes, leave it to me, Krauss‐sama."`
`"Only you can do it!`
` Please, we're counting on you...!"`
`Only he...could do it.`
` ......Holding tightly onto those words,`
` Kanon concentrated his mind again and once more set himself to the task of cutting the bars.`
`".........Enemies are coming from behind. Multiple."`
`"Yes, this time, even we can tell.`
` ......The ground's really shaking.`
` I can tell that some terrible monsters are rushing at us."`
`"Don't worry.`
` I'll seal the bars we just came through with a magic lock.`
` Goats won't be able to break it."`
`Shannon held her hand out towards the bars they had come through.`
`......But she stopped right away.`
`"Wh‐what is it...?"`
`"{f:5:Virgilia}‐sama has started neutralizing the spirit wave jamming...`
` It'll be bad if it's broken—we'll lose the initiative once the Chiester Sisters are rebooted...!"`
`"I'll make you pay in full for bullying these cute rabbits."`
`"If you're trying to gain the advantage with those crafty little spirit particles, I'll tear all that off and rob you of them."`
`"Nee‐san, concentrate on the spirit wave jamming!`
` The gap in those bars is too narrow for those goats.`
` It should hold them back for a while...!"`
`"I don't have a clue what you're saying, but—"`
`"We at least got the point that it's something pretty bad."`
`Kyrie picked up a metal bar that Kanon had just cut.`
`{n}Krauss had no weapon, but he rubbed his fist, and the two of them glared into the depths of the underground passage where the shaking was coming from.`
`"......I believe this set of bars is the final thing blocking the way."`
`"How far is it to the mansion from here?"`
`"Quite a walk...`
` The path is even, but I seem to remember walking for thirty minutes......"`
`"So if we run flat out, it'll be half that time."`
`They couldn't tell for sure since they didn't have the three‐sided mirror,`
` but there was no guarantee that George and Jessica could hold out against demon opponents for all that time.`
`"......If we run at twice walking speed, it'll be fifteen minutes.`
` And running at twice that speed again would make it eight minutes."`
`"And if we sprint flat out at double that speed again, it won't even take five.`
` No sweat."`
`"Wh‐what an unreasonable calculation...`
` But calculations in dire emergencies do tend to be that way...!"`
`"......My sincere apologies, everyone.`
` The rest will be up to you...!"`
`"Leave it to us.`
` Kanon, you cut the bars as fast as you can.`
` Shannon, you concentrate on jamming this witch called {f:5:Virgilia} or whatever.`
` Kyrie‐san and I will defend against the pursuers...!"`
`Then, the roars of beasts rang out from the darkness, and numerous fiery, glowing, bright‐red eyes appeared.`
`The goats rushing towards them, with thunderous force, were several levels more massive than the guards had been.`
`The tremors they created were almost like an earthquake.`
`{n}The power and terror was tremendous, but Kyrie instead laughed with relief.`
`{n}......Those massive bodies wouldn't be able to go through the gap in the bars!`
`The group of goats crashed into the metal bars with a terrific sound like that of a train colliding with a dead end.`
`Clumps of dirt fell here and there from the ceiling, and you could tell that the metal bars had buckled inwards.`
`.....The force of their charge must have been no different from a train.`
`{n}If the metal bars hadn't been there, they would undoubtedly have swallowed the five of them up and crushed them in an instant.`
`When the group of goats, pressed up against the metal bars, realized that the five were right in front of them,`
` they let out a terrible howl, trying to intimidate the five.`
`......Although it was hard to tell whether that was really intimidation, or because of the pain from being pushed and shoved.`
`One calm goat among them figured out that it just needed to do something about the metal bars,`
` and grabbed two of them with its massive arms, and began bending them as though opening double doors.`
`Kyrie sharply jabbed her metal pole at that goat's vitals...!`
` The goat let out a roar of anguish.`
`It probably hurt a lot, but that was all.`
`{n}It wasn't enough to bring it down...`
`"Krauss‐san...!!"`
`"Rrroooaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`Still holding the stuck‐in metal pole, Kyrie relinquished the opposite tip to Krauss.`
`Krauss ran there with all his might, leapt into the air and kicked it in with all his weight and kicking power combined...!`
`All of that destructive power was focused on that single pole, drilling it in!!`
`"......A‐are you alright?`
` Please don't rub the affected area.`
` I shall prescribe some medicine later. Take care..."`
`As the goat who had taken a pile bunker to its vitals writhed with teary eyes,`
` it nodded its head.`
`"Looks like our link isn't that bad either.`
` We can't let Shannon‐chan and Kanon‐kun beat us."`
`"Naturally. We are a loving family, after all."`
`"We can take them if it's two‐on‐one!`
` Next, that one on the right!"`
`"Roger...!`
` You seem like a great wife. That Rudolf, I'm starting to think he grumbled a little too much."`
`"Oh? You'll have to tell me about that later.`
` Rudolf‐san, it's no use you turning white in heaven, it's too late for excuses."`
`The goat's massive body sank into the rose bush.`
` Even taking into account that a leg's power is three times that of an arm's, this strength surpassed common sense.`
`That massive body, flying up and through the air from being kicked in the chin...it was too epic!`
`Even George seemed a little surprised.`
`"......To think that my kick works on monsters too.`
` I'm astonished."`
`"...............It's because of your counterattacking‐type barrier.`
` ......The attack power that grazes you is added on to your own.`
` ......The superhuman power of those monsters has been added to your kicks..."`
`"Hmm......`
` ...I don't really get it, but isn't that just perfect for me?`
` ......If you're going to attack me, then no matter who you are, you should be prepared for a counterattack of equal measure.`
` Nonaggressive defense.`
` That's exactly my policy."`
`That's why Gaap couldn't easily touch him.`
`The counterattacking‐type barrier had no defensive power.`
` However, because of its counterattacking characteristic, it could be useful in defense by making the opponent hesitate to attack.`
`The goats were foolish, so they attacked without worrying,`
` but the effect was being realized to the full against Gaap.`
`"These guys really are dull.`
` When your power is even, it's better to be of a smaller build."`
`He lightly dodged the log‐like arm.`
`When that arm touched the barrier that protected George, it let off a strong, red light.`
`......And the tip of the foot that was counterattacking gained the same shine, and the superhuman power of the goat was added to George's own.`
`The second goat fell forwards and floated in the air for a second.`
`{n}Then, George's next roundhouse kick missed right over the falling goat's head.`
`......For an instant, the goat hoped to get away with its life.`
`But no!!`
` A heel was dropped onto the back of its head, and it was forced to kiss the ground.`
`"......Going from a high roundhouse kick into a neri chagi is pretty basic, right?`
` It connects pretty often if you don't overuse it."`
`"This guy's......a problem,`
` ...seriously a problem......!!"`
`"Demons? Witches? Get real.`
` .........The rulers of Rokkenjima are this Ushiromiya family.`
` I will teach that to you with every ounce of strength in my body."`
`".........Yoooouuuu.........!!"`
`The only way to finish off George now that his body was wrapped up in the counterattacking‐type barrier...was to not allow him a counterattack.`
`......Next time she sucked him into the Abyss, she would have to kick and drop him, kick and drop him, kick and drop him,`
` until she kicked him to death!!!`
`But George had already perfected reading the faint warning signs that told of the appearance of Gaap's pitfalls.`
`......If he managed to jump over that next pit,`
` ......then this time, he would probably pulverize Gaap's head with his whirlwind‐like kick, without holding back in the slightest,`
` ......just as had been done to his parents.`
`She was able to envision that scene vividly.`
`It was far too late now, but Gaap cursed Kinzo all the same for calling her out to this ridiculous island...!`
`Ronove finally started using both of his hands to form his shield.`
`Without a more powerful shield, he wouldn't be able to completely block Jessica's fists anymore.`
`The enchantment on Jessica's fists grew the more she fought.`
`The permeation upgrade had already stacked several times,`
` and those fists had also been given an impact upgrade, a piercing upgrade, and a speed upgrade, making them fists worthy to fight on par with a demon...`
`".........What's wrong?!`
` Starting to get tired?!`
` You're getting all slow!!"`
`"No.`
` Your movements, thoughts, and kinetic vision have been exponentially enchanted.`
` .........My movements have not changed from the beginning.`
` ......Your movements are beginning to capture me."`
`"And you still won't fight back...?!!"`
`"This is the style which I insist upon.`
` ......However, I cannot allow things to continue as they are.`
` It's about time for me to get serious and end this......!!"`
`Ronove's face turned into an expression he had never shown before.`
`{n}It was truly demonic, and to Jessica's eyes, full of respect.`
`Because it was an expression only shown to enemies strong enough to make him get serious.`
`"Whooaa?!?!`
` What the heck?!"`
`With a whole‐body gesture that you couldn't call elegant, Ronove set up a shield with all his strength, the size and thickness of a wall.`
`Its sturdiness was nothing like a shield.`
` It was literally a wall.`
`And on top of that, with all of Ronove's magical power, it pushed Jessica back bit by bit.`
`......Did he plan on pushing her back against the wall and crushing her to death?`
`Jessica tried to break through the wall with both fists, but it was solid.`
` ......Without any exaggeration, it was solid!`
`"You call this serious...?!!`
` No problem... I'll break right through iiiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiitt!!"`
`"I will not let you this time.`
` This wall is somewhat different.`
` ......Here, allow me to enchant it as well."`
`Ronove made magic signs with his fingers almost like a ninja;`
` the wall glowed red for just an instant, and became imbued with some kind of ominous power.`
`Almost immediately, Jessica also gained a firsthand understanding of this.`
`Every time she pounded her fists against the wall, pain rebounded upon her as though glass fragments had scattered and hit all over her body.`
`"I upgraded it with attack‐reactive armor.`
` An exceptional item which will decrease the force of your attacks by counterbalancing them,`
` and can even counterattack with reactive fragments."`
`"......You are perfectly welcome to keep punching it, but doing so will affect you as well."`
`"Heh, ...heheh!!`
` So it's an endurance test between me and your wall?!!`
` Fine by me!!"`
`"Will you fall to your knees first, or be pushed into the wall first?`
` ......Allow me to observe."`
`"Or, I might break through it and smash that whole wall along with your face, ever think about that?!`
` Just watch meeeeeeeeeee!!"`
`Without hesitation, Jessica slammed both fists into the wall.`
`{n}Each time she did, a large amount of shards scattered, tormenting her body all over.`
`Countless red cuts soon appeared all over her body...`
`She grimaced at the intense pain, but her eyes were burning with fighting spirit, and her lips curved in a grin exactly the opposite of the pain...!`
`"Kanon, are you done yet?!`
` We are alright,`
` ......but I can't say the same for the bars holding those guys in check...!"`
`"Just......a little more......!"`
`"There's no end to these guys...`
` The bars might break just from them shoving each other!"`
`The metal bars creaked under the strain of the group of goats.`
`{n}Several arms grabbed the bars, twisting them with superhuman strength.`
`......However, some bars were being pulled in opposite directions by different hands.`
` Apparently they really were stupid.`
`The way those countless hands were grabbing the metal bars......happened to match up by chance.`
`Several hands grasping two metal bars neatly put their power together and pulled the bars to the left and right, creating an opening.`
`The incredible sound of metal bending could be heard, and that gap was getting larger bit by bit...!`
`They attacked the arms of those goats one by one, but they weren't getting anywhere.`
`{n}They couldn't stop the gap from expanding left and right...!`
`A loud metallic sound came from behind them.`
`{n}Kanon had finally finished cutting.`
`"Quickly!!"`
`"Kyrie‐san, ladies first.`
` You next, Doctor Nanjo!"`
`"Krauss‐sama, please leave this place to me...!`
` Ngh, ......what?!"`
`Kanon's red sword, with which he had cut the metal bars, disappeared.`
`"......Sorry!`
` We've entered {f:5:Virgilia}‐sama's spirit particle combat area of influence!!`
` Our magic power is being neutralized!"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` I am impressed that you put up such a fight against a Great Witch like me...`
` You can no longer use your magic in that underground passage."`
`A magic circle column drew complex magical formulae around {f:5:Virgilia}.`
`......With such full‐fledged magic being used, Shannon's power couldn't even compete.`
`On the contrary, it was surprising that she had withstood as much as she had.`
`"Spirit particle superiority ensured.`
` Come, Chiester Sisters. Now it's your turn."`
`"Wait, are you still rebooting?!`
` Why are kids so bad at waking up these days...?!"`
`"M‐my apologies, ma'am...!!`

` Did not shut down successfully last time?`

` Y‐you take your time fixing yourselves...`
` I'll go myself..."`
`""Sorryyyyyyyyy~!!""`
`The narrow underground passage was packed with goats, truly like a commuter train in the morning.`
`{f:5:Virgilia} was again in disbelief at this congestion.`
`"What are you doing...?!!"`
`"Huh?`
` You want to be first because you want the prize?`
` You're getting in each other's way because you don't want the others to steal the prize from you?"`
`"You stupid goooooooooooooaaaaaaats!!!`
` I'm going myself, so open the way!!"`
`"What?!`
` You don't want to?!`
` {f:5:Virgilia}‐sama is trying to steal the prize?!"`
`"Why are you forming a scrum?!!"`
`"Aaah, it's so crammed and tight!!`
` When did this become a goats‐only car?!`
` Ugyu~~!!`
` Whoever just touched my butt, get off at the next statioo~~n!!!"`
`".........Hm? What do you want?`
` Come this way, you say??"`
`The five people in Krauss's group dashed through the passageway with all their strength!`
`{n}They couldn't afford to dawdle around underground.`
`They had to quickly join up with the children on the surface!`
`{n}Once everyone was together, there would no longer be anything to fear!`
`Just then, a terrible rumble started closing in from behind.`
`{n}Had the pursuers finally made it through the metal bars?!`
`But they couldn't see anyone when they turned around.`
`But that rumble and the dirt falling here and there from the ceiling grew closer and closer,`
` finally catching up with them and even going past them.`
`It felt almost like they had been passed by ghosts.`
`The instant after they thought that nothing had happened, the ceiling in front of them fell in, and a single goat stood in their path.`
`......{f:5:Virgilia} was sitting on its shoulder.`
`"This wise child knew a shortcut.`
` What a good kid, you get first prize.`
` Later, I'll treat you to some homemade mackerel curry."`
`Maybe it really was happy even to receive such a dubious prize.`
` The massive goat showed its joy by putting its hands together and wiggling.`
`{f:5:Virgilia} leapt down, laughing that now it was finally checkmate.`
`"......Damn...... It's no good...`
` ......Our magic has been completely killed..."`
`"...It's too early to give up...`
` ......Even without magic, we still have our bodies..."`
`"D‐don't be ridiculous...!`
` There's no way you could fight a monster like that without that strange power...!"`
`"......S‐stay back, children..."`
`"I'll handle them somehow, so you escape past that monster while I'm keeping him busy...!"`
`"I won't let you.`
` Hohhohohohohoho!"`
`{f:5:Virgilia} clapped her hands, and a purple magic barrier appeared behind her,`
` stealing even the faint hope that Krauss had been betting on.`
`"Is there...nothing more to be done......?`
` ...N‐no, there's still a chance.`
` ......Even Jessica fought.`
` I must do the same..."`
`"A‐are you serious?!`
` It's not possible, not against that massive monster...!"`
`"Don't be absurd...!`
` Krauss‐san, let us think of another way......"`
`"If you think of something, I'm open to suggestions.`
` Until then, it looks like I'll have to manage something...`
` ......Come on, get back."`
`"......Be careful."`
`"Hohohoho...hohhohohohohohohoho!`
` My, my, Krauss.`
` You intend to fight this child alone?"`
`"........................khh...`
` Y‐you never know.`
` In a fight, it's always possible to get in a lucky shot..."`
`"Hohhohohoho.`
` You think you can win even with a fluke...?`
` Allow me to explain the situation for you, since you clearly don't know your place."`
`"Whaat......?"`
`"Hohohoho...`
` Assuming you were to wield 100% of your strength, your power level is at most 6.`
` In comparison, this child has a power level of 1000.`
` In short, even if there were 100 of you, you could never win."`
`"Well, it's true that there are uncertain elements in a fight.`
` I will admit that your power level has a slight scaling factor to it."`
`"But even so, your chances of defeating him are around perhaps 0.00001%.`
` Do you understand?`
` You don't even have a one in ten thousand chance of victory.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho...!"`
`{f:5:Virgilia} and the goat guffawed together.`
`"D‐...damn it......`
` If it's a one in ten thousand chance, then the payoff will be ten thousand times more, will it not?`
` ......A good dark horse.`
` I like betting tickets like that, makes me want to buy them..."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!`
` But the coin to buy that is your life, and there's only one of those, you know.`
` Nevertheless, I can understand the feeling of wanting to entrust your fate to that miracle."`
`"......Which is why, in praise of your courage for standing against us without fear, I shall give you a bit of a handicap.`
` This child will fight with only his left arm.`
` Well, even so, I can't imagine for a moment that he'll lose to you."`
`"............Seriously, what is that thing that keeps going bing‐bong‐bing‐bong?"`
`"V‐......very well.`
` I'll accept that challenge......`
` Left arm or whatever else, I'm sure I'd be killed with a single strike in any case.`
` ......I also only have a single chance at a strike.`
` I can only bet everything on that."`
`"That's absurd, Krauss‐san...!`
` I, I know that you used to do boxing, but I believe that was from your college days...`
` No, no, even if there were a pro boxer here, there's no way he could defeat a monster like that with just one strike...!"`
`"......That would be true if it were a match in the ring.`
` But Krauss nii‐san does have an admittedly small chance that he can set his hopes on.`
` ......He's setting all his hopes on that one chance..."`
`"Y‐you aren't saying......`
` But...there's no way that's going to work..."`
`"......Krauss‐sama........."`
`"W‐watch me...`
` I'll settle this with a single strike......"`
`Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` How unwise.`
`{n}I know what you're gunning for.`
`{n}The distance between the two of them is more than 10 meters.`
`If the goat and Krauss both step in with all their strength to settle the fight with a single blow, their power will be double the norm.`
`{n}Both will crash together, so it will be a relative 4 times normal.`
`Even if, on top of that, the strike miraculously lands on a weak point for a critical hit, that will only double the power.`
`.........In short, Krauss's maximum power level of 6, times 8, will cap out at 48 at the most.`
`He might just barely be able to win if he repeated that lucky shot a full 20 times.`
`Hohhohohohoho, if you're killed every time you take a hit, and your damage still accumulates,`
` .......let's see, perhaps you could finally win when we get to Episode 24?`
`Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho, if only this series could stretch on so long...!!`
` Either way, you don't even have the slightest chance of victory!`
`......Good gracious, what is that bing‐bong I keep hearing?`
`"I will be betting everything on a single strike...`
` You have no reason to hold back either.`
` Give it everything you've got..."`
`"Hohohoho, he's requesting that you go all out.`
` Pulverize him with a single all‐out strike, and turn him into chunks of meat."`
`As the goat got excited and beat its chest over and over, it took a position as though preparing for a sprint.`
`Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho, is this what you were hoping for?`
`Stake your hopes on your greatest power level, and despair when even that doesn't reach at all!`
`It pinged again!`
` That thing is really getting on my nerves, what {i:is} it?!`
`"Here I come......`
` Ready?"`
`The goat roared in response.`
`Then, with a matched timing that only the men confronting each other could comprehend,`
` ......the two leapt forward like bullets shot out of a gun.`
`The men howled, collecting the strength from all over their bodies into one arm each.`
`The goat's fiery glowing eyes clearly locked onto Krauss's face.`
`......He could perfectly see a vision of when he would step forwards,`
` when he would punch through Krauss and blow him away,`
` and when he would achieve his total victory.`
`The long, painful days before today drifted through the goat's mind......`
`The hard days of training where his senpais had picked on him...`
`The faint glimpses of his senpais' warm concern during those days.`
`And the joy of that day his power had been acknowledged, and he had been accepted as one of the team...!`
`I never properly respected my parents.`
`......That's right, I'd actually planned on washing my hands of this business when this job was over, and returning to my hometown.`
`Sorry, my little goat sister...your onii‐chan caused you nothing but trouble.`
`And I, ...a‐actually have a childhood friend, and I'm going to marry her when I get hoooooome!!!`
`"Gyaaaaaaaaahh!!!`
` Nooooooooooo!!`
` Don't trip so many {c:86EF9C:loser flaaaaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aags}!!"`
`"You can't handle that punch, dodge iiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`It happened the instant before the two crashed and their punches crossed.`
`"Foolish, {f:5:Virgilia}.`
` It looks like you couldn't make a composed decision."`
`"You must not take that punch!!`
` Deflect it!!"`
`"?!?!"`
`The very instant the goat's left straight and Krauss's right straight crossed!`
` The goat obeyed {f:5:Virgilia}'s order with super‐fast reflexes and pulled back his straight, deflecting Krauss's punch!`
`".........mmgh—"`
`Yes, {f:5:Virgilia}'s decision was probably wise.`
`{n}After all, the number of loser flags act as a multiplier on the opponent's power level!`
`"That was close.`
` If you had taken that punch after tripping so many loser flags, imagine just how great a force it would have been multiplied to...!!"`
`"Come on, from there, smash the completely open right side of his face with a right straight!!"`
`"What?`
` The promise about fighting with only your left arm?"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho!!`
` Promises are made to be brokennnnn!!"`
`"Gyaah, tripped another ooooooone!!"`
`"I'm disappointed, {f:5:Virgilia}.`
` You really were lacking composure."`
`"What's that......?!`
` How was I not composed by noticing it beforehand and making him avoid it...?!"`
`"Wh‐...why is that, Kyrie‐sama...?`
` If they had crashed like that, wouldn't Krauss‐sama have won......?"`
`".........Ah, I, I see...!`
` Even with 20 loser flags,`
` ......that's still not enough!"`
`Krauss's and the goat's double rush make it x4.`
`{n}With a miracle on their side, the firm promise of a critical hit would double it again for x8.`
`On top of that, a multiplier of x20 equal to the number of tripped loser flags applies, making it x160.`
`At a glance, that looks like an incredible amplification, but even so, Krauss's power level is 6.`
`{n}Even multiplied by 160, it only makes for a power level of 960.`
`{n}Just a fraction below the goat's 1000...!`
`"That's why I said you weren't composed.`
` You made a blunder.`
` If they had crashed like that, you would have won."`
`"H‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!!`
` Even if that were so, it all comes to the same thing if this right straight smashes Krauss's head!!`
` Die, Ushiromiya Krauss!!!"`
`"......Take this...the most powerful blow in the world of boxing."`
`Having deflected Krauss's right straight,`
` the goat's own right straight closed in on the right side of Krauss's face, which had been left open...`
`But there, it crossed with a left straight from Krauss...`
`The two punches crossed, and time stopped as each aimed for the face of the other......`
`"Ho.........hohohoho.`
` To think that it would be brought to a simultaneous strike at a moment like this!`
` But his power level caps out at x160, making it 960!!`
` You never made it to my child's 1000...!"`
`".........No.`
` {f:5:Virgilia}‐san.`
` ......You've lost."`
`"Why?!"`
`"You made your goat deflect the first cross‐counter.`
` ......Certainly, if the right straight he issued after that were to hit, Krauss‐san would probably be in pieces."`
`"...However, that was crossed...`
` ......That's just no good.`
` I'm afraid this is a complete loss for your goat."`
`A cross‐counter has four times the destructive power.`
`{n}This is common knowledge in boxing.`
`And if that is deflected, and the right straight hits, then the double cross‐counter has 8 times the destructive power.`
`{n}This is also common knowledge in boxing.`
`If that is crossed......`
`{n}By the principle of leverage, the triple cross then multiplies the destructive power by 12!`
`This is also painfully common knowledge in the world of boxing!!`
`".........Krauss‐san's power level is 6."`
`"A double multiplier from both sides for rushing in, making it times 4."`
`"Th‐the critical hit makes it times 8."`
`"Up to times 160 for tripping too many loser flags."`
`"......And times 12 on top of that for the triple cross‐counter."`
`"T‐......times 1920......"`
`A power level of...11520...!!`
` Krauss's punch now had the power to easily win that Budokai tournament...!!!`
`"......This result was brought about by Krauss‐san's persistence in not giving up on victory until the end, ......and your conceit.`
` Without either, it would never have become so powerful..."`
`"......You fought well.`
` .........It's okay, you can fall now..."`
`Nanjo patted the goat on the shoulder...`
`......O‐......onii‐chan...gave it his all......`
`As the sparkling drops from the goat's eyes scattered, he softly toppled backwards,`
` and flattened {f:5:Virgilia} like a pancake.`
`"Ugyaa!!`
` Heavyyyyyyy, get oooffffff!"`
`The goat's massive body was too heavy for the slender {f:5:Virgilia}.`
`{n}She floundered around with it on top of her, but it didn't look like she would be able to escape.`
`In that instant, the barrier {f:5:Virgilia} had sealed broke.`
`"No hard feelings, please.`
` Underestimating the principle of leverage was the cause of your defeat."`
`"......I wonder why the principle of leverage worked on that counter.`
` It's an eternal mystery."`
`"Let's escape while we can...!!`
` You take care, {nobr:Mr. Goat}...!"`
`"W‐well then, excuse us, {f:5:Virgilia}‐sama!"`
`".........*bow*."`
`"Waaaaaaaaiiit!!`
` Get back heeeere!!`
` Get this thing off meeeeee!!`
` Kiiii!! Gapgapgapgap!!!"`
`There was nothing more to block their way.`
`{n}......They ran through the underground passage with single‐minded purpose...!`
`Jessica had finally been cornered with the wall at her back.`
`{n}......Ronove's magic barrier was advancing bit by bit, and would probably crush her against the wall before long.`
`Considering the distance...this would be the final strike, the final throw of her iron fist.`
`Jessica had dealt out many punches so far.`
`......The wall wasn't invincible.`
` It had already started to crack, and it wouldn't be strange for it to smash at any moment.`
`However, due to the rebounding damage,`
` Jessica herself was in very bad shape, with cuts all over her body.`
`"......Just stop this now.`
` I don't intend to crush you.`
` It is up to the Master to decide how to deal with you.`
` ......However, I do intend to put in a good word for your impressive fight."`
`"N‐`
`.........no...frigging...`
`...way...`
` ......Not yet......`
` It's not......over yet........."`
`"......You have wounds all over your body.`
` It's all you can manage just to stand, is it not?`
` ......It seems that you plan on putting all of your strength into this final strike.`
` However, that final strike will instead prove fatal for you."`
`The damage reflected by Ronove's magic barrier was proportional to the strength of the attack.`
`{n}Jessica's all‐out punch would be bounced back onto her.`
`......The more all‐out she went, the more suicidal it would be for her.`
`"I, I get it......`
` I know that........."`
`"I am warning you.`
` Stop this now.`
` It is for your own good."`
`"Stop bluffing.`
` Your wall is about to break, right...?`
` I've been the one punching it, you think I can't feel that.........?"`
`"........................"`
`That was...a fact.`
` Ronove's wall was already on the verge of breaking.`
`And on top of that,`
` Jessica's fists had been imbued with an unimaginable magical attack power by now, and their destructive power defied the imagination.`
`......If she wasn't careful, that destructive power might pierce the defensive wall, smash Ronove as well,`
` and then go on to expand the size of her bedroom by connecting it to the room next door.`
`......However, that damage would rebound on Jessica as well.`
`{n}She wouldn't escape unharmed!`
`"I will say it just one more time.`
` Stop.`
` I say this out of consideration for you!"`
`"Shut the hell up......`
` .........Say your prayers."`
`Jessica howled.`
` ......Putting all her strength and her last and greatest destructive power into her fist, she roared......`
`The three goats had been beaten down long ago.`
` Without a single ragged breath, George cautiously closed the distance between him and Gaap.`
`......He was after her.`
` He was planning on bringing her down with a single strike...`
`Gaap was also aiming for a single strike.`
`{n}.........If she let that chance slide, this time, she would be killed......`
`"......Aren't you going to use your pitfalls?"`
`"............Ack......"`
`Even the tiny moment of weakness during the time it took to open the hole would prove fatal against George now.`
`......Gaap cautiously calculated the distance and timing, but even as she did, George closed the gap between them...`
`".........If you won't move forward, then I will."`
`"......C‐......come on then...`
` No more tricks.`
` ......This kick of mine...`
`...will end this!"`
`The instant she noticed George's body blur, ......only his jacket was floating in the air.`
`A short sound of realization entered her mind, and in that instant, darkness covered her.`
`George, with his heel swung up high, looked even like a massive dragon attacking from the sky.`
`"Y‐you fell for it......`
` ......I win, Ushiromiya George!!"`
`"What—"`
`Gaap opened a vast pit with her in the center, and swallowed up George along with herself...!!`
`The two were swallowed up by the pit, and spat out from the ceiling of the arbor.`
`But that was what Gaap had been after, so she alone landed lightly.`
` ......But there was another pit in George's landing spot.`
`"Ehheheheheheheh, aaaahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!!`
` Got you, Ushiromiya Geooooooo{-}o{-}o{-}orge!!"`
`"It's been fun die now,`
` it would be a waste for someone as good as you to end up as the Ushiromiya family head,`
` so I'll eat you up right here, right now!!!`
` Oooooorrrrrooo{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}oa{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!"`
`George once again fell from the ceiling of the arbor.`
` He had probably been dropped the same distance as falling off the roof of a two‐story building.`
`In midair, he couldn't control his posture in any way.`
`{n}It was impossible to resist or defend or avoid!!`
`As Gaap spun like a whirlwind, she concentrated all of her energy on the sharp tip of her stiletto heel.`
`......This was the final strike...to perform his requiem.`
`{n}The queen bee's final strike, that would bore into heaven, knocking him down into the true Abyss!!`
`"Welcome to the Abyss!!`
` This is the end of the line for you!!!"`
`Her prey captured in her sight, she launched her foot up into the sky.`
`......It was then that she saw George's face.`
` .........Even though he was in midair, he was calmly adjusting his glasses with the middle finger of his left hand.`
`And his posture was still preserved as that of an axe kick.`
`{n}Aiming for Gaap's forehead, without the faintest deviation......`
`".........I already anticipated that you would opt for that move."`
`"............Wh...at.........?"`
`"If I'd jumped to make the person that was {i:on the ground} taste my heel, my posture would have collapsed long ago.`
` .........However, my posture hasn't collapsed in the slightest.`
` Do you know why?"`
`"......You...`
`...don't...`
`mean......"`
`"From the very beginning,`
` ......I jumped to make the person that was two stories below taste my heel!!!"`
`"Uungh, ......ooooooo{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}h{0}h{0}h{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhhh!!!"`
`"You lose, missy!!!"`
`"Bing‐bong."`
`"Unnggggrrrroooooaaaaaaahhh, take thiiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiiss!!!"`
`Jessica's last and strongest upwards punch...`
`reached the wall,`
` ......and was sucked in.`
`It was sucked into the black, large hole that had suddenly opened on the wall.`
`"Well, .........I did advise you to stop."`
`"What.........the............"`
`"......Ghhg............ah......"`
`"Truth is,`
` .........I was never in even the slightest little bit of trouble.`
` Soorry..."`
`......Jessica's fist had gone for George's stomach,`
` ......and George's axe kick had lined up on Jessica's head.`
`The shocking destructive power imbued in Jessica's fist crushed George's organs and scattered his abdomen.`
`The equally‐as‐shocking destructive power in George's axe kick smashed half of Jessica's head, and scattered its contents in the same manner......`
`"Pfft, ...ahhahahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` I mean, come onnnn.`
` Witches are all about the acting, riiiiight?`
` Hey, Riiche, how was it, were you watching...?"`
`"Wahahaha, waaaahhyahhyahhya, aaakkyakkyakkya!!`
` Not baaad, followed the script to a T!`
` You really do get it, Gaap!!`
` Woohoo!!"`
`Beato and Gaap gave each other a light high five.`
`"......hhh...`
`...aaahh...`
`............hhhhhhuuAAAA{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}AAHHH!!!"`
`"Thanks, Ronove.`
` That was a treat.`
` I'll return Jessica's corpse back there.`
` ......Separate the corpses of the two who are close.`
` ......Is the second twilight done now?"`
`Gaap dropped Jessica's corpse into a pit,`
` and chucked all the chunks of meat, too, into Jessica's room,`
` as carelessly as throwing them into the trash...`
`Jessica's corpse and lumps of flesh fell from the ceiling and poured out all over her room.`
`Ronove shook his head slightly at this all‐too‐gruesome change.`
`"............My apologies, Jessica‐sama.`
` I did warn you."`
`"Of course,`
` ...I suppose it's only natural that a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} like yourself can't understand the demonic pleasure I derive from foreseeing this conclusion and giving you repeated warnings that I know you won't listen to.`
` ......Pukkuku{0}ku{0}ku{0}ku{0}ku{0}ku{0}kukuku!"`
`"It really was fun, kiddo.`
` ......But you play with words a little too much.`
` ......I think ‘If you're ready, may I fight back’ was the absolute classic?`
` Eheheh, you've been reading a few too many light novels or something, you know?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`In the arbor brutally decorated by George and Jessica's scattered blood and guts,`
` Gaap enjoyed a loud laugh for a while...`
`...But she quickly realized that, in all seriousness, this was a little too filthy and undignified, and she snapped her fingers.`
`As she did, gold butterflies rose up from the ground all around the garden,`
` stuck to each of the bits and stained patches of blood, and got them out.`
`......Then, bit by bit, they slowly turned back into George's corpse,`
` and the awful corpse with its guts splattered out was repaired into a clean corpse that looked like it was sleeping.`
`Was this some kind of post‐mortem sportsmanship towards a good opponent............?`
`The heavens were slowly split.`
`......Because Gaap had lifted a leg high into the air, pointing at the sky.`
`"So long, lady killer.`
` This is the real Game Over."`
`Squish.`
` ......Without a trace of mercy, that foot was brought down,`
` ......and buried into George's forehead.`
`Her stiletto heel, sharp as a weapon, was impaled through George's forehead.`
`She......pulled it out with a blorp......`
`It was like a mark of proof that Gaap had indeed finished him by her own hand......`
`Ronove returned Jessica's corpse to its original form as well.`
`{n}......And unlike how it had been with George, he also restored Jessica's life......`
`"...U‐...nff, .........*cough*, *cough*......`
`......what in the.........world......`
` ......A dream......?"`
`"No, that is wrong.`
` ......You certainly did pass away, Jessica‐sama.`
` You should be well aware of the memory of your final moments."`
`It was burnt into the back of Jessica's mind.`
`......For some reason, she remembered being thrown somewhere, ......and that her head had been smashed by George's heel......`
`"Am I......alive......?"`
`"No, you are dead.`
` That is merely being postponed for a scant three minutes with my magic.`
` After three minutes, the magic will end, and you will return to being a tragic corpse with half of its head destroyed."`
`"Wha......t.........?`
` ......Heh, .........heheheheh......"`
`"Death is brutal.`
` In most cases, you aren't even given the time to ready your heart.`
` ......However, I have decided to give you that time, in recognition of your valiant battle.`
` Use those three minutes to ensure that your lingering attachments to this world are all taken care of."`
`"Or, ......I could use those three minutes to take you down with me......"`
`But the power that had been burning inside Jessica's body was now completely lost.`
`......Jessica was aware of that herself.`
` She was already dead.`
`"Well then, I will leave you now.`
` If you would excuse me.`
` ......It was fun, Jessica‐sama."`
`Ronove turned his form into a cloud of gold butterflies, and disappeared.`
`All that remained was the sound of the wind and rain, and the figure of Jessica, crouching down against the wall......`
`Jessica realized.`
` After three minutes, she probably really would revert to the corpse she had been.`
`......In those three minutes, was there anything she could do.........?`
`She stood up, and with a shaky gait,`
` ......took the phone that was on the desk...`
`"He‐......hello.`
` ......Is that you, Jessica?`
` Jessica?!`
` What is it, are you alright?!?!"`
`".........Heh, ......heheheheh...`
` ......They...got me......"`
`"Are you alright?!`
` Are you hurt?!`
` I'll come help you right now!!"`
`"Nah, ......it's too late.`
` ...I'm...already dead, apparently...`
` Ahahaha, by the time you get here, I'll be a corpse with half my head spilled out."`
`"God{i:damn} that old man!!`
` Wait right there, I'm coming right now!!"`
`"Listen, Battler!!!`
` Listen closely, alright...?`
` .........I know exactly why Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san were so awkward talking about the guys who killed the six in the dining hall."`
`".........Those guys, uh...`
`......they aren't...`
`{y:0:Human}{n:0:human}."`
`"Wh‐...whaat?!`
` What are you talking about........."`
`"What do you want me to say, man, I frigging saw it, okay?!!`
` Those guys, they warp, set up barriers, ahhaha, {i:all} of that crap, y'know...?`
` It's like some manga, some anime, ......seriously, we can't deal with that."`
`"......Ahhahhahhah......`
` ...It was never gonna happen, fighting them... It's impossible......`
` That hat‐stand spear you were so proud of, you'd need something way better than that to deal with these guys..."`
`A line of blood dripped down from Jessica's forehead......`
`"George nii‐san didn't make it either.`
` Instant death, that was...`
` .........Heheh, the next test is yours, Battler.`
` .........I wonder if your test will be the same as ours......`
` .........Be careful, ......and don't get it wrong."`
`"Y‐you mean the test...?"`
`"No.`
` .........Don't get it wrong and...`
`...think the enemy's obviously gotta be {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}."`
`".........The enemy...is not {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` ...They're demons......who can wield terrifying magic at will."`
`"No matter what, ......don't get that wrong......"`
`"*cough*, *cough*cough*!! Watch......yourself......"`
`A line of blood dripped down from Jessica's mouth as well.`
`......The left half of her head started hurting.`
`Jessica realized that she was about to return to the corpse she had been.`
`"...............When thirteen people die, the Golden Witch...revives.`
` Mom and the others killed earlier were the first six.`
` That's the first twilight.`
` ......And with George nii‐san and me dead, that's the second.`
` ......So if just five more people are killed, the ritual is gonna be complete, ......and the witch will revive."`
`".........I hope Dad and the rest are safe...`
` ......If they aren't,`
` .........the one to test you...`
`might be the newly resurrected {f:5:Beatrice} herself..."`
`By now, Battler had no idea what Jessica was saying.`
`{n}But from her tone, he realized that she knew she was about to die.`
`So even though he didn't understand the situation, he urged her to hang on in there.`
`"......Haha, I told you, I'm already dead.`
` .........See ya.`
` It looks like time's up.`
` ......Good luck on your test.`
` I hope you can...become the head.`
` ..........................."`
`"Jessica?`
` Jessica?!`
` Hey, answer me!!`
` Jessicaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`Battler's sorrowful voice could be heard from the dangling receiver.`
`......Crouching with her back against the adjacent wall...`
`{n}......Jessica's head was half smashed.........`
`"Where are we......?"`
`"...Is this...a well......?`
` Where is this...?"`
`Kyrie stuck her face out of the well, and then Krauss showed himself too.`
`{n}When he noticed that they could see the back of the mansion beyond a grove of trees, Krauss realized more or less where they were.`
`......To think that there had been a hidden underground passage in a well all the way out here,`
` and that it led to a hidden mansion......`
`"Th‐this really is tough on this old body......`
` ......Ordinarily, you can come up through a different place, with real stairs.`
` Provided you can unlock it..."`
`"......I have many questions I'd like to ask you about the layout of this place later, Doctor Nanjo.`
` ......Shannon, are you alright? Grab my hand."`
`"I, ......I'm okay.`
` Kanon‐kun, quickly."`
`Kanon was the last, climbing up the ladder towards them in the shaft disguised as a well.`
`{n}......It was probably quite deep.`
`When he looked down, for the first time, he realized how far he'd come up.`
`"Nihi. Firing."`
`Bang.`
`............As Kanon was about to finally crawl out of the well, a hole the size of a basketball opened up in his chest.`
`......Everyone there looked through the hole in Kanon's chest to the scenery beyond......`
`"K‐..........Kanon‐kun!!!"`
`"......Ne...`
`...e‐sa...`
`............"`
`Kanon toppled backwards,`
` ......and was swallowed up into the depths of the well......`
`"E‐everyone, run for it!!`
` The Chiester Sisters!!`
` They've locked on, we can't avoid them!!`
` Run!!`
` At least one of us survive...!!!"`
`At that time, Krauss, Kyrie, and Nanjo...`
`clearly saw a golden curve appear from the well,`
` ......and sew itself through the side of Shannon's head.........`
`"Shannon!!!"`
`Head pierced.`
` The three were perfect witnesses to everything, up to and including the opposite side of her head being blasted away into pulp.`
`Shannon fell to her knees,`
` .........blood gushing from both sides of her head,`
` and flopped to the ground.`
`"W‐waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhyaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"They're after us!!`
` Run!!`
` We'll be killed!!"`
`"...R‐run...run run run!!!"`
`Nanjo had become paralyzed in fright by the manner of Shannon's death, and the Chiester Sisters would not miss their chance.`
`A curve again appeared from the well, and pierced through Nanjo's forehead and out the back of his head in an instant, sewing through him.`
`......Thump.`
` And so Nanjo expired.`
`"What on Earth... Why...?!!`
` Where's the enemy attacking from?!"`
`"We're being sniped!!`
` I don't know where from, but they have us completely in their sights!!`
` Escape into the mansion, block their line of sight!!"`
`The two dashed into the back entrance of the mansion.`
`Then, the instant Krauss tried to shut the door behind him...`
`......a golden curve appeared for the fourth time, piercing Krauss from the back of his head out through his forehead, and smashing even his forehead to pieces...`
`"............nngg...`
`.........oohh............"`
`"Eeek!!`
` Hiyiiiiiiii!!!"`
`Krauss's body lurched over, fell down hard, and drew a neat radial pattern with the insides of his head...`
`Kyrie ran wildly through the hallway, flew into some room, and locked the door.`
`.........But she couldn't imagine for a moment that this would save her life.`
`She would probably die soon!`
`This was apparently one of the guest rooms.`
`{n}......At that moment, a phone on a side table caught Kyrie's eye...`
`After hanging up the call from Jessica, Battler was literally just about to dash out.`
`In that instant, the phone rang again.`
`"H‐hello!!!`
` ...............Huh?`
` Kyrie‐san?!"`
`"......Yes, Battler‐kun.`
` ......I got lucky.`
` I managed to escape the dungeon somehow.`
` I really was fortunate."`
`"Where are you?!`
` Is everyone alright?!`
` On our side, it looks like Jessica and George‐aniki are—"`
`"Listen!!!`
` I probably won't be alive for long."`
`Then, right after she got the sudden feeling that the keyhole of the locked door might have glowed gold,`
` a gold, curved line drawing a helix...`
`...no, a golden sewing thread...infiltrated the room through there at an incredible speed, and bored a hole into the floor by Kyrie's feet.`
`......Oh, that's rare.`
`The enemy, who had sniped the other four one after another with extraordinary skill,`
` apparently really does have trouble shooting me between the eyes with a single shot while I'm holed up in this room.`
`But the next strike will probably hit......`
`At this point, Kyrie finally remembered the initial massacre in the dining hall......`
`......That's right......`
` ......This is what killed Rudolf and the rest, all six of them......`
`"......Listen, Battler‐kun.`
` I'm going to tell you everything exactly as I saw it.`
` ...I'm sure you'll think that something's gone wrong with my head."`
`"......In fact, it's alright for you to think that.`
` Even I still haven't come to terms with what it was I saw."`
`".........Today,`
` after you all returned to the guesthouse, the family conference began in the dining hall,`
` ......and I'll tell you everything that happened next."`
`"Listen until the end without butting in.`
` ............The call might suddenly be cut off partway through.`
` If it is, that's the moment I was killed."`
`".........Kyrie......san......"`
`Then, Kyrie spoke...`
`......about how Kinzo had come, the family conference had started,`
` ......the six had been killed, and the five of them had been confined.`
`......About how she had escaped somehow, and made it to where she was now,`
` and how everyone had finally been killed—all spoken dispassionately, as she had seen it, with no dramatization.`
`......She even spoke about how everyone except her had been killed, and how she had observed the moments of all their deaths,`
` ......and how, even this very moment, someone was trying to kill her.`
`"............Actually,`
` even while we've been talking, ...I've been attacked three times.`
` Something like a strange gold thread keeps flying in through the keyhole, spinning around and aiming for me."`
`"First it was by my feet.`
` ......Next, it was close to my shoulders.`
` ......Just now, it grazed my ear.`
` ......Its aim is getting more and more accurate.`
` Looks like it'll go right between my eyes pretty soon......"`
`"R‐run, Kyrie‐san...!!`
` Run awaaaaaaaaaaay!!!"`
`"Where to?`
` ......You realize,`
` ...I've managed to run all the way here,`
` ......shut myself into a room, and even locked the door......?`
` .........And I'm still being targeted.`
` .........Just where am I meant to hide...?`
` ......Seriously......"`
`"Ky......`
`ri...`
`e...`
`...san........."`
`"Battler‐kun...`
` Are Jessica‐chan and George‐kun......still alive?"`
`".....................`
` ......Just now, ...there was a phone call from Jessica...`
` .........It kinda......sounded like they were...done for......"`
`".........Thought so.`
` ......Yeah, when we five were being killed one after another, I had a kind of premonition.`
` ......I thought that perhaps the second twilight had been finished in the thirteen‐person murder ritual, and that our twilights had been reached."`
`".........In other words, when I die, that's thirteen.`
` Then the ritual will be complete.`
` ......The Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, will be resurrected."`
`".........I wonder what will happen.`
` ......On this island filled with demons and witches, and swarming with goat monsters,`
` ......when even the boss of them all, the Golden Witch, appears,`
` .........I wonder just what in the world will happen...`
` ......At this point,`
` I can't...`
`......make any sense of anything anymore."`
`Kyrie‐san's voice......had given up, completely, on her own life.`
`And because Battler could tell that,`
` ......he couldn't stop the tears......`
`"......I did have just one thing...I can advise you on."`
`"What...?"`
`".........Even if...`
`a demon or a witch does appear in front of you..."`
`"Yeah..."`
`"There's no need whatsoever to doubt what they are.`
` ......Understand that they are what they seem."`
`"........................"`
`"You might think that there should be some trick, or that there's some true identity behind it.`
` ......If you have the time to think of something like that,`
` ......it would be much more constructive to think of how not to damage the mood of whatever you're facing."`
`"......Even mistakenly, ...you must not say "Prove it then, show me some magic"...`
` ......They will probably use a method of utmost cruelty...`
`...to show you the proof."`
`"......I can't...`
`...believe it......`
` ......I never thought...`
`...I'd hear something like that coming from your mouth...`
` ......I can't believe it........."`
`"I understand.`
` That it's unbelievable.`
` ......That's why...that's the only advice I can give to you.`
` ......{i:Believe}."`
`".........You're telling me to believe in {f:5:Beatrice}...and demons and witches and monsters......?"`
`"Probably,`
` ......even after being so clearly shown all those things not of this world,`
` ......we still weren't able to believe any of it, I think."`
`"......I'm like that even now.`
` ......The true form of this thing that keeps attacking me, trying to shoot through my forehead,`
` ......is something I can't understand,`
` .........and I can't believe."`
`"So,`
` ......I want you at least to believe, to understand,`
` .........and to accept that being which...`
`...we couldn't fully accept.`
` If you do that for me, our deaths won't have been in vain.`
` .........It'll also have been worth it for me to make this phone call...`
` ......Ah...!"`
`"K‐Kyrie‐san?!?!"`
`"......I'm still okay.`
` It grazed me, but it missed again.`
` ......I very much doubt...`
`.........that I'll survive the next one.`
` .........Thank you.`
` And goodbye, Battler‐kun.`
` ......I was once cold towards you because you were Asumu‐san's son.`
` ......Forgive me...for those days."`
`"What do you mean, {i:forgive} you? Kyrie‐san, you are a {i:mother} to me now!!"`
`I felt as though I heard an incredible sound at the other end of the receiver.`
`{n}And then, a noisy clattering sound.`
`......As though the receiver had fallen to the floor.`
`"Kyrie‐san?!?!`
` Kyrie‐san!!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!"`
`.........Kyrie‐san never...`
`......responded through the phone...`
`.........again.........`
