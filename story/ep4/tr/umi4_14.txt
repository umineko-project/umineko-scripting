`The clinic that Nanjo had opened and later passed on to his son still existed on Niijima.`
`The aged doctor was Nanjo's son, but the atmosphere about him was very different.`
`"I am truly sorry to say this after you have come all this way, but I have nothing in particular to tell you."`
`Nanjo's son spoke very indifferently.`
`"......After the accident on that island was taken up by the talk shows in a most indiscreet manner,`
` there was a great deal of deeply offensive probing into my father, who was {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya's} doctor and friend."`
`"All of it was without proof, and also, defiled all of my father's previous achievements.`
` I still feel a great deal of resentment towards all of that."`
`"............I think that's understandable.`
` It's been pretty much the same for me.`
` Constantly since I was six."`
`"True.`
` My apologies."`
`The doctor finally remembered that Ange was also a victim, exposed to the same curious eyes as he had been.`
`"In that case, you can probably understand why I want nothing more to do with that incident.`
` ......That was an unfortunate accident.`
` The only ones who want to make a fuss about it being a crime are the irresponsible TV shows and magazines.`
` I am more than fed up with their attitude."`
`.........Nanjo had been placed in the spotlight for being one of Ushiromiya Kinzo's few friends.`
`Because of that, there had probably been a persistent offensive from the Witch Hunters and the press to use the late Nanjo's son as well as a source of information.`
`......The doctor went on and on, criticizing the press indignantly.`
`"I really understand how you feel.`
` My personal life was put under surveillance,`
` and I had no privacy, no portrait rights, heck, I don't know if I was even afforded human rights.`
` So I {i:deeply} empathize with your pent‐up anger."`
`".........And for that very reason, I want to know, more than anything else, what in the world was that incident that so thoroughly ruined my life.`
` That's why I came here."`
`".........I'm a related party just like you.`
` Not a magazine columnist or an interviewer.`
` Please, don't get the wrong idea."`
`"I didn't come to do this for fun.`
` ......And I'd very much appreciate it if you stopped looking down on me.`
` If we're going to do a comparison of whose life was most screwed up by that incident, you won't even come close."`
`"............mgh......"`
`Ange spoke sharply.`
`Never having imagined that he would be talked back to in such a forceful manner, the doctor couldn't help but fall silent.`
`......From Ange's perspective, the doctor was whining about absolutely nothing.`
`She really wanted him to pack in his patronizing attitude.`
` It was about time to make him understand how many days had passed for her before arriving on this island.`
`The doctor realized that he had misspoken, and remained silent for a while, looking uncomfortable.`
`"I know it's probably painful to remember what happened at the time, but if there's anything you do know, please tell me, no matter what it is.`
` Of course, I'll tell no one."`
`"I visited here today to bring some closure to my life.`
` ......I'm eighteen.`
` That incident took away twelve years of my life.`
` And it'll probably keep on taking."`
`"......I was thrown into darkness when I was six years old and I've never gotten out.`
` Are you still going to tell me I have no right to know...?"`
`".........No, ...I'm sorry.`
` It seems that since all the others who came were ill‐natured folk, I instinctively put up my guard.`
` I apologize for my rudeness."`
`"......Alright.`
` If you'll swear not to breathe a word of this to anyone, I'll tell you everything."`
`"Thank you, Doctor.`
` ......Then, if you would.`
` Please tell me anything you can."`
`"......As you know, my father was not only {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya's} personal physician, but his friend through the game of chess.`
` That relationship was very long, stretching back to the time {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya} moved to Rokkenjima."`
`"Just how close were they?"`
`"Considerably, it seems.`
` It seems that their connection through chess led my father to stay at {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya's} mansion quite often."`
`"......I am not sure it is right of me to say this, but {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya} was extremely moody.`
` And my father was an exceedingly magnanimous man, who excelled at interacting with people like him.`
` It's not hard to imagine that he was a rare friend for the isolated {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya}."`
`"That day was the day of the family conference.`
` ......The Ushiromiya family conferences are said to have involved harsh questioning from Ushiromiya Kinzo over how his fortune would be put to use,`
` almost like a financial conference.`
` So Doctor Nanjo had gained a trust so great that he was asked to attend even that...?"`
`"My father was a simple doctor,`
` so I cannot imagine that he was in a position to advise on asset management for a millionaire family like the Ushiromiyas."`
`"He was most likely called there to assist, because {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya's} health was not at its best at the time.`
` ......As {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya's} close friend, I'm sure that my father would have kept his mouth shut, and been trusted not to leak the secrets of the family conference."`
`"......Was Ushiromiya Kinzo in very bad health at the time?`
` Are there any medical charts left?"`
`"My father probably took the medical charts with him on the day of the accident.`
` I'm afraid to say that the entire folder of {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya's} medical charts has been lost.`
` He was my father's patient, so I don't know the details either."`
`"Around the time of the incident.`
` Was there anything you thought was strange?"`
`".....................`
` ......Well, there was...`
` ......However, it seems exceedingly likely to result in a misunderstanding, so I don't particularly want to talk about it."`
`"......What is it?`
` Please tell me."`
`For a while, the doctor beat around the bush,`
` but after he'd said that much, Ange would not allow the subject to be dodged.`
`Eventually, he was worn down, and after making Ange swear herself to secrecy again, he opened up......`
`"The truth is, several days after that accident, I received something by mail at my home."`
`".........Mail?"`
`"It was very curious.`
` The sender was made out to be me, but I had no memory of it.`
` Someone had sent it in my name."`
`"The destination was Rebun Island in Hokkaido.`
` ......It's at the northernmost tip of Japan, excluding the Northern Territories.`
` The recipient's address was on Rebun Island, but.........`
`the name was my father's."`
`"......However, it seems there was a problem with the destination address, so it had received an "Address Unknown" label,`
` and been returned to the sender, "me"."`
`It was...truly a strange tale.`
`Nanjo's son's name was written as the sender.`
`{n}......However, he said that he hadn't mailed the letter.`
`In short, that meant someone had sent it using his name.`
`The destination was "Nanjo Terumasa", on Hokkaido's Rebun Island.`
`But the lot number written on it didn't exist,`
` so the local post office had been unable to deliver it, and instead sent it back to "the sender, Nanjo's son"......`
`"......What was inside?"`
`"...........................`
` ......I truly ask that you keep silent about this.`
` I am by no means pleased to have received this.`
` Even so, I can hardly throw it away......"`
`The doctor stood up and headed for the bookshelf.`
`There, dozens of dictionaries that could only have been ornamental were lined up one after another,`
` asserting in the strongest way imaginable that the owner was an intellectual.`
`When he pulled several volumes out from there, a large, brown envelope was hidden behind them.`
`He took it out and tossed it onto the desk.`
`It had been been carefully sealed with adhesive tape,`
` and its faded color and dryness told that it had remained sealed for twelve whole years......`
`"Most sincerely, .........I ask for your silence."`
`While emphasizing it so much it was annoying, the doctor removed the seal with a quality paper knife.`
`......Then, when he tilted the envelope, an already opened mail envelope spilled out.`
`The envelope had weight to it, hinting that there was something other than a letter inside.`
`.........The recipient...was certainly Nanjo Terumasa.`
`{n}Even seeing that......was a huge shock.`
`After that incident, Nanjo's corpse had not been found, and he was being treated as dead in absentia under extraordinary circumstances.`
`......And despite that, this letter addressed to a Nanjo in Hokkaido existed.`
`{n}One could almost take this as a sign that he had faked his own death and escaped to Hokkaido.`
`"......Was Doctor Nanjo really in Hokkaido?`
` Or was there another person there with the same first and last names?"`
`"If my father had somehow escaped from the accident and was living on in Hokkaido,`
` that would have made our family very happy, regardless of the situation."`
`"I also thought of that possibility at first.`
` ......However, the destination address of this envelope does not exist.`
` In short, this envelope was mail that had no way of reaching him."`
`"............Is there a possibility that the sender miswrote the correct address?"`
`"Of course, I cannot disprove that.`
` However, judging from the residence's house number, I find that hard to believe."`
`".........`
`Hokkaido,`
` Rebun Island,`
` Rebun County,`
` Rebun City,`
` 1‐2‐34‐567.`
` ....................."`
`Up until Rebun City, it's alright.`
`...But I just couldn't wipe away the feeling that following sequential number, 1234567, was a little insincere.`
`It felt like a fake address that some kid had made up.`
`"They probably just randomly wrote some clearly nonexistent address.`
` I think it's natural to assume that, from the very beginning, this envelope was sent to a nonexistent address to which {i:it had no chance of being delivered}."`
`If the destination address doesn't exist, mail is generally returned to the sender.`
`But even in the case of a faulty address, the local post office will often courteously,`
` and to the best of its ability, research to find whether the sender's intended destination exists.`
`When they still can't find it, the mail is sometimes returned after an investigation of several days.`
`It seemed that this was what had happened with this envelope, and the stamp was postmarked October 3rd.`
`It was postmarked on Niijima.`
`{n}Niijima is a long way away from Rebun Island.`
`On top of that, the destination was also nonsensical.`
`{n}......It had taken more than a week for the mail to be returned.`
`......In other words, there was an extremely high chance that having this envelope returned to the sender after an indeterminate amount of time...`
`had been the goal from the very beginning.`
`Why do something like that.........?`
`Even before asking what it was that had been sent, this envelope was already veiled in mystery......`
`"..................And inside it?"`
`"Go ahead."`
`After getting the doctor's permission, I tilted the already opened envelope.`
`From the inside came a small, folded letter, and a small key with a number tag attached.`
` A swipe card slid out in addition.`
`A112 was engraved on the key's number tag.`
`{n}......I didn't know what it meant.`
`The swipe card was pitch black and had gold letters engraved on it.`
`"MEMBERS" was written there in English.`
` The jet‐black, gold‐lettered card design made it feel like something very high‐class.`
`......But of course, I didn't have a clue what kind of card it was just from that.`
`......I unfolded the letter.`
`{n}Its contents were extremely brief, and only the following was written:`
`07151129.`
`And the name of a certain massive bank known throughout Japan, as well as the words "Central Branch".`
`......That was all.`
`"What's this.........?"`
`"...............`
` .........It's a card, a key, and a PIN for a safe‐deposit box.`
` And it wasn't a normal safe‐deposit box either.`
` It was an unsettling one, which was apparently reserved only for special clients."`
`After he had finished putting his affairs in order following his father's funeral, he visited the bank.`
`......PIN and key and card.`
` There was no doubt that something of great importance was stored there,`
` and it was natural that he was curious about what that could be.`
`At first, he didn't know what to do.`
`{n}......The card wasn't properly his possession.`
`When he mustered up his courage and showed the card to a bank clerk, he was then switched to a clerk of clearly high status, and was guided to a large vault on the fourth basement floor.`
`The security on the way there was strict.`
`The doctor had himself stored valuable items such as real estate transcripts in safe‐deposit boxes before,`
` but this was something on a whole different level......`
`"......Unlike the procedure at the deposit box I use,`
` their system didn't carry out any identity checks so long as you had a card, a PIN, and a key."`
`"......But, in any case, it was a very secure vault, and I was frightened by how imposing it was.`
` ......I wondered what kind of shady objects might await me that had to be stored in a place like this."`
`"............And so?"`
`"When I passed the card through the reader, I was asked to input the PIN.`
` And after that eight digit number was input and authenticated, I was permitted access to the vault."`
`"......It was an incredible scene.`
` A world like something from a sci‐fi movie.`
` That massive, dimly lit silver room was covered with doors to safes."`
`He entered that room along with the clerk.`
`As soon as the card was read, the vaults he had a right to were apparently determined,`
` so that safes he could open were lit with a green light, while those he couldn't open were lit with a red one.`
`"A112 indicated one of those safes.`
` ......By the way, there was a long line of other safes marked with a green lamp besides that one.`
` I think there were at least twenty."`
`"There might even have been more in other corners of the room.`
` ......In any event, I only had the key to A112.`
` I had no way of checking the contents of the other safes."`
`As the clerk watched, the doctor unlocked and opened the safe.`
`When he did, a safe drawer like a large cabinet opened,`
` ......and an expensive‐looking duralumin case showed itself...`
`That was carried into a separate room, where for the first time, the clerk left, and he was introduced to the contents......`
`"And the contents were.........?"`
`"........................`
` ............Cash."`
`"Cash?`
` How much?"`
`"I have heard that a pack of one million yen in fresh banknotes is precisely one centimeter thick.`
` Since those were.........packed tightly into a duralumin case of such a size..."`
`"......There was probably a hundred million total.`
` I don't know, because I didn't count.`
` I didn't even touch it with my hands.`
` I realized at once.`
` This was dangerous money."`
`It isn't normal to store a whole hundred million yen in cash in a safe like that, case and all.`
`......It's much easier to deal with if you deposit it into a bank account and turn it into a number.`
`The very fact that they were unable to do that made it clear that there was something wrong with that cash......`
`"......My mind went blank, and I instantly realized that I must not get involved."`
`"And you didn't use it at all?"`
`"Yes.`
` I locked it straight back up, returned it to the original safe, and left.`
` ......I have thought about throwing away that key and card, but I have no idea what might happen.`
` For that reason, I've been hiding it in the back of the bookcase, a secret from everyone, for a full twelve years.`
` .........I still don't know what kind of money that was."`
`"......Could I borrow this envelope?"`
`"No.`
` Please just view it here."`
`".....................`
` ......Alright.`
` Then if I may.`
` There's something I want to investigate."`
`I took Onee‐chan's grimoire from the knapsack I had set down.`
`......Then I opened to the page with the paragraph {f:5:Beatrice} had written to Onee‐chan, and compared the handwriting on both......`
`"..................................................."`
`............The characteristic handwriting was unmistakable.`
` The one who had sent this hundred million yen in cash............was {f:5:Beatrice} herself......`
`But, .........what is it...`
` Something's bugging me......`
`{n}What is it.........`
` What is it.........`
`".........Y‐......yeah.`
` I'm pretty sure I got something like that in the mail.`
` Hey Ma, where'd I put that again?!"`
`The same envelope and contents had been sent to Kumasawa's son, who had once lived with her.`
`But he had been very busy in the days since, and seemed to have forgotten about it among the hustle and bustle of everyday life.`
`But apparently, its strange contents had stayed in his memory, and he remembered as soon as Ange told him......`
`After a bit of a wait,`
` his thin‐lipped wife came with the envelope, complaining that he always forgets where he puts things......`
`The modus operandi for the sender and recipient was exactly the same as for Nanjo's son.`
`{n}The sender was made out to be Kumasawa's son, and the recipient was Kumasawa Chiyo.`
`And the destination address was in the Okinawa Prefecture.`
`{n}Okinawa Prefecture, Yaeyama County, Yonaguni City, {nobr:1‐2‐341‐5167}.`
`Yonaguni Island is at the westernmost tip of Japan.`
`{n}And the lot number was exactly like before: a sequential number that had apparently been chosen at random.`
`......Now it was certain.`
` This envelope was definitely sent with the goal of having it be returned to the sender.`
`Its contents were exactly the same.`
`A letter with the PIN and the bank's central branch written on it.`
`{n}A swipe card.`
` A key with attached number tag.`
`The inscription on the number tag was A113.`
`{n}......The number right after the one on the key that had been sent to Nanjo's son.`
`Most likely, inside the vault was the same kind of duralumin case, packed with a hundred million yen in cash......`
`"......Got the feeling my mom had sent it to me from beyond the grave.`
` Don't really get what's inside, and it's creepy, so I just left it alone all this time, and totally forgot about it until today."`
`"......So, you know what this is, girl?`
` Could it be that the same thing came to your place...?"`
`".......................................ah."`
`"......What is it, Ange‐sama?"`
`‘Uryu...headache? Headache...?!’`
`"............Sorry, my head hurts......`
` ......Stabbing pain... .........I {i:know} this......"`
`‘What do you mean, you know this......?’`
`"You don't mean,`
` ......this envelope......came to your place too, Ange‐sama...?"`
`.........I remember......`
` ......I remember......!!`
`A strange envelope was also sent to me...twelve years ago...!!`
`I had fallen into depression after losing my entire family.`
` ...But it was a really strange thing to come in the mail, so a faint memory of it remained.`
`It was a strange letter, which I had no memory of sending, but which had me as the sender.`
`I forget the destination address, but the person it had been sent to was Ushiromiya Rudolf.`
`{n}My father.`
`I remember that I got this letter I thought was from my father who had died, I opened it up,`
` and I found a key and a card that I didn't really understand... I remember being really confused.`
`I felt let down, and threw it away somewhere, I think...`
`Where did I put that envelope?`
`{n}I probably lost it somewhere in the chaos that followed.`
`By now, I have no way of checking its contents.`
`But somehow I think I can guess.`
`......I'm sure the contents were the same.`
` Without a doubt, there must have been a key, a card, and a note with a PIN inside the envelope......`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}......`
` ......What was she trying to do here...?`
` So did she hand out this stupid money to all surviving relatives?`
` .........I won't forgive her......for mocking them even after their deaths........."`
`‘Uryu...uryu......Ange.........’`
`Sakutarou acted nervously.`
` ......As I looked at his worrying face, my agitation began to cool off bit by bit...`
`"I'm sorry...`
` My hatred of {f:5:Beatrice} isn't anything new.`
` ......I'm just surprised and angry to find out that I had a connection with the witch already on that day, at the age of six..."`
`".........For the past twelve years,`
` you have been enslaved by {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's curse.`
` ...This might be proof that this really was a curse.`
` But please, don't fall apart.`
` Part of this journey should be to break through that."`
`"That's right......`
` Just letting the blood rise to my head won't get me anywhere.`
` Got to think calmly.`
` .........What's going on?`
` What's the meaning of handing out a hundred million yen to each of the relatives?`
` Was she trying to provoke us......?`
` Damn that {f:5:Beatrice}........."`
`‘Ange......calm down......`
` ......Uryu......’`
`As Sakutaro buried his head in my stomach, he urged me to stay calm.`
`......I took another deep breath, and started thinking.`
`".........I wonder if the sending of these envelopes was to demonstrate that this was a premeditated crime by {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"They were postmarked right before the family conference.`
` And they were intentionally set up so that they would be sent back after some time."`
`‘......They wanted them to arrive after the incident, is that it......?’`
`"Yeah.`
` That's what it implies.`
` .........But it still leaves me wondering a little.`
` Why such an uncertain method?"`
`"Uncertain?"`
`"Yes.`
` After all, you can't even guess in advance at how many days it would take for the mail to return.`
` ......Normally, you can't even guess at the amount of time it will take for the receiving post office to do the research, make a determination of unknown recipient, and send it back."`
`‘Yeah, now that you mention it......`
` It'd be more certain if they just set an arrival date and mailed it that way......`
` Uryu...’`
`"......Maybe, but still,`
` if they mailed it the day before, then no matter how quickly it returned, it would probably have arrived no earlier than Monday.`
` I wonder if they wanted to make it seem like a letter from the dead."`
`"......A letter from the dead, you say."`
`"......You're right.`
` That surprises you, and makes you feel horrible.`
` ......Some mail with your dead family's names written on the outside in large letters...`
`gets thrown into your mailbox with an ominous label attached."`
`"......However, it doesn't really make sense to me.`
` I would have mailed it to arrive on a specified day.`
` I just can't understand why someone would allow the insecurity of it possibly arriving on a day they weren't anticipating."`
`‘.....................Uryu.`
` ......But that really does sound like Beato to me.’`
`"Huh?`
` You...know about Beato?"`
`‘......Well, I only talked with her a little.`
` ......But somehow I can tell that Beato would do something like this.’`
`‘.........Can't you imagine that too, Mammon?`
` Beato likes pranks like this, right?’`
`"..................`
` .........Yeah, that might be true.`
` ......I wouldn't put it past {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama to try a vicious prank like a letter from the dead."`
`‘No, not just that part.`
` .........{f:5:Beatrice} would find it more fun to do it in a way that was a little bit uncertain, instead of one that was absolutely certain.’`
`".........She would find an uncertain method...more fun...?"`
`I remembered Maria onee‐chan's diary...`
`{n}......It had quite a lot of descriptions of playing with {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`Occasionally, some of these involved Beato playing pranks on the adult relatives with Maria.`
`But those pranks always followed a certain little aesthetic principle of witches.`
`Which was.........that things are more fun if they are uncertain.`
`One day, Maria onee‐chan had brought a wind‐up minicar, and she and Beato decided to use it for a prank.`
`It was a popular toy at the time—if you made the minicar back up, it would wind up the spring in the tires, and when you let go, it would race forwards.`
`They had wound up that minicar and set it in the shadow of a milk jug.`
`......In other words, the prank was that, if you lifted the milk jug, the minicar would jump forwards and surprise whoever did it.`
`Hoping that someone would get caught in this prank, Onee‐chan and Beato had watched the adults from the shadows for their whole teatime.`
`They were looking forward to seeing who would get caught by it, but ultimately, no one moved the trap milk jug, and the trap never went off......`
`When Onee‐chan had then muttered "We should have put it somewhere where they'd definitely get caught by it",`
` Beato apparently said this.`
`She said,`
` "Traps where you don't know who will get caught, or even whether anyone will get caught at all, are more thrilling and fun".`
`......It's probably true that you wouldn't get that kind of excitement from a trap that would definitely catch someone.`
`......This kind of description occurred in multiple places,`
` making it possible to guess that the witch called {f:5:Beatrice} had quite a fickle character and loved a random thrill......`
`A fickle person is very hard to deal with.`
` I can't flip over the chessboard......to find out what that witch from twelve years ago was planning.`
`As Ange thought these things over, her gaze wandered from place to place.`
`Then, she suddenly showed interest in the wall.`
`{n}There, a number of framed photographs were hung.`
`Many were commemorative photos from when the Kumasawas got together as a family or went somewhere to play, and Kumasawa herself was in many of them.`
`...Still with a smile that made it so you could almost hear her lighthearted hoh‐hoh‐ho laugh.`
`......It's a distant memory, but I do remember that she was definitely this sort of cheerful old lady...`
`"Did you notice anything different about Kumasawa‐san in the days leading up to the incident...?"`
`"Nope.`
` She looked the same as ever.`
` .....Grumbling about how tough the family conference was and how it put her on edge, same as always."`
`"............?`
` ......What's this?"`
`Among the numerous frames, there was one that had something other than a picture of people in it.`
`It was a photograph of an enlarged relief of a door from a Western‐style house or something.`
`......I couldn't see any interesting subject in particular, which actually bugged me a bit as I wondered why anyone had gone to all the trouble of taking it.`
`As I got closer, I realized that some text had been written in pen.`
`"......Oh yeah, that's a photo I got when Mom's belongings were distributed.`
` I think it probably has something to do with that "Legend of the Gold" thing."`
`"The witch's epitaph, you mean?`
` Rumored to point to the location of the hidden ten tons of gold...`
` ......So Kumasawa‐san tried to solve it too, I see.`
` But this isn't the epitaph.`
` ......It's the first time I've seen it."`
`There was an arch above the Western‐style door, and that arch had a relief.`
` It was an inscription in English, and that seemed to be the focus of the photograph.`
`The pen writing appeared to be a translation into Japanese.`
`".....................`
` "This door will only open with a probability of 1/1,000,000,000,000,000.`
` You will only be blessed with a probability of 1/1,000,000,000,000,000."`
` .........I don't know it.`
` Nothing like this ever showed up in the epitaph or Onee‐chan's diary."`
`"In Mom's belongings, there were quite a few photos and notebooks that looked like they were from her trying to solve the epitaph's riddle."`
`"Turns out she was actually surprisingly fond of that kind of thing.`
` And there was that rumor that ten tons of gold bars were hidden somewhere.`
` No wonder she was so besotted by it."`
`In both Maria onee‐chan's diary and in her grimoire, there was a description of the witch's epitaph.`
`It mentioned about how it was a ritual to open the door to the Golden Land, and {f:5:Beatrice}'s resurrection ritual, and {f:5:Beatrice}'s succession ceremony.`
` And so on.`
`Maybe the most interesting one was the last line, the succession ceremony.`
`According to {f:5:Beatrice},`
` if you were able to solve the witch's epitaph,`
` you would receive not only the ten tons of gold and the Ushiromiya family inheritance,`
` but her own magical power and name, as well as the title of Golden Witch.`
`Among the Ushiromiya family at the time, the witch's epitaph was thought of as a difficult quiz, which the head, Kinzo, had prepared to select his successor.`
`But in the Mariage Sorcière interpretation, the questioner was {f:5:Beatrice} herself,`
` and she had posed the question in part to choose her successor.`
`......There were slight discrepancies in the details of the two interpretations.`
`Either way, its disturbing contents brought to mind a bloody serial murder,`
` and both of the message bottles depicted a crime that followed that pattern.`
`If I could solve the witch's epitaph now, twelve years later, I wonder if I could expose some plot made back then......`
`I tried to solve it many times myself, but I never did have a clue what it meant.`
`{n}It seems that many Witch Hunters have been trying as well.`
`I also found theories like the La Plata theory and the Enoura theory in certain books.`
`However, none of these theories were conclusive......`
`"Are there any other materials?"`
`"I think so, but they were all split up between my siblings.`
` I don't have a clue who has what.`
` Sorry."`
`".........Just reading this English text that Kumasawa‐san took a picture of, it gives the impression that this was a forbidden door that was rarely opened."`
`"......But where in the mansion is it, I wonder.`
` Judging by the lighting, it looks like it's outside.`
` ......I wonder if Kumasawa‐san suspected that the gold was hidden in there."`
`"Who knows.`
` In any case, it's probably {i:somewhere} in the Rokkenjima mansion.`
` ......It's a pity, but there wasn't the kind of money in Mom's bank account to make me think she found the gold.`
` Uhahahaha, she probably didn't find it after all."`
`......The Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, gave ten tons of gold to Kinzo.`
`Which meant that the witch was the true owner of the gold.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} was the owner of all the vast fortune of the Ushiromiya family.`
`The witch holding this vast wealth had massacred the humans on Rokkenjima on that day,`
` ...and sent large amounts of money to the surviving relatives like it was a game.`
`......Like hell it's a letter from the dead.`
` This is desecration of the dead.`
`I was once again convinced.`
` ......My family, who died on the island that day, didn't die and go to heaven.`
`They're being trapped by the witch even now, and are being desecrated and tormented for all eternity......`
`The last place Ange visited...`
`was a store in a region where residential and commercial areas intermingled, with a signboard saying "Marufuku Sleep Shop"......`
`There lived the man who had been the captain of the ferryboat to Rokkenjima at the time.`
`......Even he, who had once lived as a man of the sea, had retired after contracting a serious illness,`
` and was now being taken care of at the house of his son and his son's wife...`
`"I remember you well...!`
` You were only about yea high.`
` Look at you now...!`
` You must have been absolutely devastated.`
` I understand how you feel, believe me...!"`
`The former boat captain was so full of energy that you couldn't really tell why he had retired in the first place.`
`His memory seemed clear too; he had a good memory of things that had happened more than a decade prior, and it seemed that he could even remember how Ange had been at the time.`
`The lively conversation was very helpful for Ange,`
` ......but at the same time, the captain also remembered the final family conference very well,`
` and the fact that he had detailed memories of even Battler's "gonna fall gonna fall uproar" on the boat was instead painful for Ange.`
`It had been so back then as well, but even now, there was no public way to cross to Rokkenjima.`
`It was necessary to make an individual request to an owner of a boat to make the voyage.`
`I still hadn't managed to arrange for a boat to Rokkenjima,`
` so if he refused me, the voyage to Rokkenjima would probably become hopeless......`
`"No need to explain.`
` It'd be no easy job finding a boat willing to go to that island at this point.`
` ......Nowadays, some of 'em don't even call it Rokkenjima any more, they call it by its old name, Akujikijima.`
` Can't see you getting any sailor round here to help you out."`
`Originally, Rokkenjima had been feared as an island of disaster by the fishermen.`
`And when that incident happened twelve years ago, that fear reached its peak......`
`They respected the sea, feared it, and revered it.`
` There were almost no sailors who would try to take a boat to the cursed island.`
`Because of that, most of the Witch Hunters were unable to cross over to Rokkenjima,`
` and were limited to taking a trip around the island.`
`......Ironically, this caused the mystique surrounding Rokkenjima to increase even more,`
` and resulted in the proliferation of the bizarre witch stories they loved so much...`
`".........Would you take me in your boat?"`
`"Mm.`
` They're sposed to give her back to me just for tomorrow.`
` I hear the engine's been acting up lately, though.`
` We'll crank it up to full throttle!"`
`The former boat captain promised that tomorrow, he would go back to his previous job and take his boat out to Rokkenjima.`
`With this, I'd managed to secure a method of transport to Rokkenjima.`
`{n}This is probably all I can do on Niijima.`
`All that's left is...tomorrow.`
` On Rokkenjima, ......I'll reach the final destination of a journey that stretches back twelve years.`
`‘That's great news...`
` You'll be able to go to the island now...’`
`"Yes.`
` ......I'd heard that it would be hard to find a boat, so the boat captain's cooperation really helped me out."`
`".........Although he may not have been as badly affected as you, Ange‐sama,`
` I'm sure that the incident twelve years ago has been a thorn for the boat captain as well, one that he still hasn't been able to pull out."`
`‘......Uryu.`
` ......Even the captain wasn't able to find closure.`
` This whole time.’`
`"Well, yeah.`
` ......If that guy had taken his boat out on October 5th as promised, there's a chance that he could've saved a great many people.`
` If he hadn't been hesitant with his boat just because of a little wind..."`
`‘Uryu... You shouldn't say things like that...`
` I'm sure that's pained the captain constantly until today......’`
`I heard that it had truly been right in the middle of a typhoon on October 5th.`
`According to the boat captain, he had known for certain that they would be trapped by the typhoon if they headed to Rokkenjima on October 4th.`
`But the family had been very insistent upon that date, which had been determined beforehand as the date of the conference.`
`......It was only natural.`
` All of the adults had their own packed schedules, and had come to the family conference having arranged those schedules in advance.`
`They probably had their own circumstances preventing them from easily pushing it back to next week just because the typhoon was approaching.`
`......It wasn't the boat captain's fault.`
`But perhaps you could say that he didn't feel so guiltless that he could place the blame wholly on the typhoon.`
`Certainly, just as these two said, there's no doubt that the boat captain has been dragging the events of twelve years ago along with him this whole time.`
`......And, by taking me, the last member of the Ushiromiya line, to the island,`
` and bringing me back safely, he might be trying to find some resolution for the past...`
`"The boat's meant to be coming back just after noon.`
` I'll take you to Rokkenjima after that, so we should get there before evening.`
` It's an island without electricity or lights.`
` You won't be able to stay long.`
` ......Is a short trip like that gonna satisfy you?"`
`".....................`
` It's not the kind of thing where staying longer will satisfy me more.`
` I'm grateful just to have you take me there."`
`"Mm, don't mention it.`
` If I hadn't parted with my boat, I wouldn't have to be so stingy, and I'd be able to take you to the island as much as you like..."`
`It's not like I have a goal of doing something in particular on Rokkenjima.`
`{n}So, the time of day I'll be staying there is evening...`
`......The evening, which straddles the two different worlds of day and night, seemed almost like a borderline between this world and the next—`
`or possibly, between 1998 and 1986—and felt like the most fitting time to visit Rokkenjima.`
`......It's not like I'll be doing anything on the island.`
` Staying there for just a few hours will be just fine if I can feel some closure.`
`At that time, there was a small knock on the paper sliding door, and Amakusa stuck his head in, tapping his watch.`
`I nodded back and told him I'd gotten hold of a boat for tomorrow.`
`"That's great.`
` ......It's about time for us to go.`
` We'll be counting on you tomorrow, Captain."`
`"You betcha!`
` I know all about the troubles you've had.`
` I was watching the talk shows at the time, and I was disgusted by all the people stirring up that incident just for fun.`
` I'll help you out any way I can."`
`"Thank you very much.`
` ......Then we'll see you noon tomorrow.`
` Umm, here.`
` The fare for the boat."`
`Ange took a wrapped wad of ten‐thousand yen bills from her pocket.`
`The boat captain must have seen its thickness as well.`
` But he paid it absolutely no interest, and shook his head.`
`"......I'm grateful to you.`
` This is guidance from heaven.`
` I'm being given a final chance to take you to Rokkenjima and bring you back safely."`
`"Now, I'll finally be able to finish the final job Kinzo‐san entrusted me with.`
` So I'm grateful to you.`
` I got more than enough money from Kinzo‐san back then.`
` Can't take it from you."`
`".....................Thank you very much."`
`"Watch your step on the stairs.`
` They're a doozy."`
`......I went down the steep staircase that was the exact opposite of "accessible".`
`It was getting hard to believe that there had actually been a chest of drawers and a TV in the room upstairs.`
`Most of the first floor was a bedding store, with many futons piled up on each other.`
`The captain followed behind us as we weaved our way through the cramped futon shop.`
`After cautiously checking around outside, Amakusa dashed out first and started up the car.`
`"My grandkid's room is empty.`
` I really wouldn't mind if you stayed there.`
` As you can tell, I'm up to my eyes in futons."`
`"Thanks a lot for the offer.`
` ......But I can't cause you trouble if worst comes to worst."`
`".........Dunno your circumstances, but seems to me like you're caught up in a lot of trouble.`
` There's rumors some shady people are on the lookout for someone.`
` Wouldn't happen to be you, would it?"`
`".....................`
` ......How should I know?"`
`Ange played dumb, but it looked as though the boat captain had guessed.`
`"My job was to take visitors to Rokkenjima over to the island, ......and bring them back again."`
`"......That job was interrupted twelve years ago, and it still hasn't been finished.`
` So, thanks to you, I'm finally gonna be able to finish that job."`
`"....................."`
`"So what I'm saying is.`
` .........Please let me finish the job.`
` Do you understand?"`
`"..................`
` ......Yes.`
` It's not like I'm going there to die."`
`But part of me does feel that, if I could die on that island, I would surely be able to go to where my family is......`
`I had finally become aware of it.`
` ......I might have been planning......to die on that island.`
`I might have come all this way, heading for Rokkenjima, in search of a place to die.`
`The boat captain had guessed that as well.`
`{n}And so, for emphasis, he told me again: Don't.`
`".........I won't.`
` I promise.`
` .........In the first place,`
` I'm still unclear about why I even have to go to Rokkenjima, what the purpose is at all."`
`"No, I'm sure there's gotta be one.`
` If there isn't one for you, ...then there is one for {i:them}.`
` The island called you.`
` That's why you came here."`
`".........You might...be right.`
` ...I might......have been called."`
`I was called.`
` For what reason?`
` For them.`
`{n}Mom.`
` Dad.`
` Battler onii‐chan.`
`{n}......And...Maria onee‐chan.`
`.........Or maybe, the Golden Witch.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`What does Rokkenjima have for me?`
`{n}And what will I achieve?`
`Even though tomorrow was almost upon me at last, I still wasn't able to understand my own mission......`
`There was the sound of a car stopping in front of the store, and a short honk could be heard.`
`"Then I'll see you tomorrow.`
` Have a nice evening."`
`"Mm."`
`I got past the stacks of futons in the narrow store, and was about to go outside.`
`{n}............Just then, my feet stopped.`
`"......What is it?"`
`"...........................Uh,`
` ...............umm,`
` what is that......?"`
`"Hmm?`
` That?`
` What?`
` What are you talking about?"`
`Trembling all over, .........I pointed at it.`
`But no matter how much the boat captain squinted, he noticed absolutely nothing in that direction that should have surprised me.`
`......That means,`
` ............th‐......that means............`
`"............Im‐impossible......`
` ...Wh‐why............?"`
`‘U‐.........uryu.........`
` ......Ange,`
` ......why?`
` What's going on......?!’`
`"......I, .........I don't have a clue either......`
` There's no way something that ridiculous......`
` Is this magic?`
` A miracle......?"`
`".........Yes, this is probably fate.`
` ......I just......understood.`
` ............This......was my mission."`
`‘............Uryu...............’`
`"I.........don't have a clue what's........."`
`I was frozen in position, shaking, pointing into the semi‐darkness inside the store......`
`"Wh‐what is it?`
` What's over there?!`
` I don't, ...I don't understand...`
` Wh‐what is it that you see...?!"`
`"Thank you, Captain.`
` ......All of this, all of it,`
` ......it was all fate.`
` Even me visiting this place...`
`...was fate.`
` ............This...`
`......is the mission...and the purpose...that I'm going to Rokkenjima for........."`
`"............Ange‐san?`
` What is it, is something wrong?"`
`"I, I'm as clueless as you...!`
` She's just gone still as a statue, pointing into the darkness...!"`
`"Ange‐san......?`
` Are you alright?`
` What can you see......?"`
`"Can't you two see it?`
` That, right there.`
` ......Can't you see it?!"`
`"All I can see is a normal display case.`
` There's no one there, missy...?"`
`‘Uryu............Ange......`
` ......I don't know what's going on......`
` ......Is this......a dream?`
` Magic......?`
` What's happening......?`
` ...............?`
` ............Ange...............?’`
`Sakutarou lifted his face towards Ange......`
`From her eyes...`
`{Comment:Intentionally left out, doesn't work in English (......ぼろりと、):}`
`...slid a single tear.`
`".........Ange‐sama.................."`
`"......I understand.`
` Onee‐chan.`
` ......And...`
`............{f:5:Beatrice}."`
`‘.........Uryu.........’`
`So {i:this}............is magic.........`
