`"Amakusa, could you turn that off?"`
`"Whoops, my bad.`
` You don't like {nobr:M. Zakky}?"`
`"I'm just not in the mood."`
`Amakusa turned the radio off.`
`The world of cheery sounds was immediately swallowed up by the roar of the sea,`
` and blotted out by the ocean's gray......`
`".........See it?`
` Over there's where the harbor was at the time."`
`".............................."`
`The boat captain pointed, but I couldn't really recall how it looked twelve years ago.`
`......I had believed that my memories of back then would come flooding back into my mind,`
` ...but no memories were coming back to me at all.`
`After the incident, the island was sealed off and left to the wild.`
`......Probably that's understandable, I had to tell myself, to stop myself from feeling somehow...sad and hurt.`
`.........Ah, but I at least remember one thing.`
`You could say that it would probably be the same anywhere on the sea, ......but at least this one thing, I do remember.`
`The cries...`
`of the seagulls.`
` I do remember those.`
`......I almost never went to the ocean when I was young.`
`...So, to me, everything that symbolized the ocean meant Rokkenjima, and my family getting together.`
`In short, ......it was a symbol for the happiness of going out with my family.`
`However, at this point in time, it even seems doubtful whether that was happiness at all.`
`In my younger days, the trip had felt like a relaxed family vacation, but considering my parents' situation at the time,`
` it was surely a very difficult trip to handle, with the distribution of the inheritance filling the place with the smell of flaring tempers and fuses about to blow.`
`I can remember giggling all over the place, completely ignorant of my parents' feelings...`
`"Rokkenjima, ......is it.`
` The beginning of everything, and the last stop for all journeys."`
`Amakusa tried too hard in an attempt to speak for my innermost feelings.`
`The boat slowly rounded the island.`
` ......As the angle changed, I hoped that my memories of the island's silhouette at the time might come back just a little,`
` but in the end, even as the inlet was completely hidden by the cliffs, I wasn't able to remember anything...`
`"......Captain, that thing you mentioned...`
`about the other harbor...please tell me about it."`
`"Mmhm.`
` .........They say Rokkenjima's only got one harbor.`
` But that's only its outward appearance."`
`"An extra hidden harbor on the back of the island.`
` .........That's Rokkenjima all over.`
` It has a second face, which no one knows about..."`
`"............Rokkenjima is an island in the possession of the Ushiromiya family.`
` But it has another face, as an island owned by Kinzo‐san personally......"`
`"One island, two harbors, two mansions, ......is it.`
` He sure spent a lot just so he could keep a mistress."`
`"Who knew about this other harbor...?"`
`"Not many.`
` Kinzo‐san, Genji‐san the butler.`
` Those of us involved with the boats,`
` and a very small number of the oldest servants.`
` ......The last owner of the Nanjo clinic and that Kumasawa baa‐san knew as well.`
` Naming 'em off like this makes it sound like there were a bunch of 'em, but I tell you now, it was only a very small number who knew."`
`"Please...tell me about that other mansion."`
`"......All's I was told is there's a mansion called Kuwadorian.`
` Wasn't allowed to leave the boat, so I never once saw the place, though."`
`"So it was far away enough that you couldn't see it from the harbor?"`
`"Beats me.`
` ......But it was a hidden mansion after all.`
` Probably was built where you can't see it from the outside.`
` ...Anyway, Kuwadorian was that island's biggest secret."`
`"There's a theory that {f:5:Beatrice} was being made to live in Kuwadorian,`
` or else was being confined there... What do you think, Captain?"`
`"......I carried over sundries meant for Kuwadorian, too.`
` Oftentimes that included stuff only women would use, and fancy stuff at that.`
` ......No doubt in my mind, that theory is true."`
`"So does that mean you never saw this {f:5:Beatrice} woman directly, Captain?"`
`"Never.`
` Came and went for close to twenty years, and never saw her once."`
`"Twenty years...!`
` Whew, so that's at least plus twenty onto her age.`
` Well, that shoots down my hopes for a mademoiselle."`
`"But one day, bang, all trips to and from Kuwadorian stopped.`
` That was about thirty years ago,`
` ......so around {ruby:Showa 43:1968}, I think."`
`"Bang?`
` You mean suddenly?"`
`"......We'd come by the back on a specified schedule to carry food and trash one way or the other.`
` ......Uh, when I say the back, I mean the harbor on the Kuwadorian side."`
`"I get it.`
` ...So then?"`
`"So one day, I get a sudden message from Genji‐san.`
` And he tells me, until you hear differently, we don't need you to go to the back anymore."`
`"And did you hear differently?"`
`"Not in particular.`
` To cut a long story short, one day, suddenly, I was told they didn't need regular service at the back anymore, and not to bother taking food there either.`
` ......Thought I'd been given the boot at first."`
`"But it wasn't long before I realized.`
` ......And I kind of got the picture from the reactions of the servants who knew of Kuwadorian, as well."`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice} died, and there was no longer any need to take food or people to care for her?"`
`"That's what I think.`
` I've never been told to take another boat to the back since.`
` But after that, Genji‐san came to see me face to face,`
` and got real pushy, demanding me to take everything about "the back" with me to the grave."`
`"So, if that hidden mansion was abandoned for twenty whole years,`
` .........why was Aunt Eva there?"`
`On that day twelve years ago...`
`......Ushiromiya Eva somehow escaped harm alone in a hidden mansion two kilometers away from the regular mansion.`
`Why was she in a hidden mansion that had been forgotten for twenty years.........?`
`"I saw that on the talk shows.`
` Even I can't make heads or tails of that.`
` Not once did I show Eva‐san to the back.`
` I don't have the first damn clue how she knew about Kuwadorian or how she got there."`
`"I wonder if it was possible to go to the back where Kuwadorian is by land."`
`"......If, as we heard, the forest was dense and uncultivated,`
` I seriously doubt a well‐dressed lady person'd be able to push through it."`
`"So what about by sea?`
` Maybe there was a motorboat or something."`
`"Are you kidding?`
` That two‐nighter typhoon was awful.`
` No way you could'a used a boat."`
`"What if there was......an underground passage or something between the mansion and Kuwadorian.`
` It would have been a pain to have to charter a boat each time he wanted to visit his mistress's house, right...?"`
`"A tunnel long enough to connect mansions on opposite sides of a two‐kilometer island like Rokkenjima...?"`
`"...Well, I'd like to laugh at the thought, but this is a guy so rich he made a whole hidden mansion for his mistress.`
` Guess I can't deny the possibility.`
` ......What do you think, Captain?"`
`"I'm a man of the sea.`
` No good asking me about holes.`
` But the Japanese military dug a {i:twenty‐five}‐kilometer tunnel on Iwo Jima.`
` Wouldn't surprise me one bit if {i:the} Kinzo‐san could dig at least two."`
`".....................This really is a strange island.`
` Even now, not one of us really knows a thing about it."`
`The boat reached the shore.`
` There would be a short walk to reach the mansion.`
`"......I'll wait here.`
` The mansion's that way.`
` The path from back then's probably still there, but I'll bet it's covered with plants.`
` Make sure you don't get yourself lost."`
`"Right, off we go, then?"`
`"Thanks, Amakusa.`
` But you wait here too."`
`".........Eh, I had a feeling you'd say that."`
`"I'm just delivering something.`
` You'll just be trouble for them if you're with me.`
` I imagine your toxin is strong."`
`"Toxin?`
` Hmm."`
`"I'll be back soon.`
` Our main goal today is Kuwadorian.`
` ......After I deliver this, I'll come right back."`
`Ange put on her knapsack and grabbed the flowers she was planning to offer.`
`"Take the hint, young'un.`
` ......Go on, gal.`
` Your family's waiting for you."`
`I had never been on a road like this, but I had no trouble finding my way.`
`{n}If I walked straight ahead, it would probably guide me to the final destination for everything.`
`The vegetation certainly was incredible, and you would lose track of the path if you were careless enough to let your attention drift.`
`......But the road that was left was much better than I had imagined.`
`Still, that didn't change the fact that it was a bad road.`
`......Contrary to the distance shown on the map, I was forced to walk a long way......`
`......The forest was deep and dark.`
`At the time, I had been threatened into staying away from the forest because a witch lived there.`
`Of course, that fear is gone now, .........but I feel it.`
`Other people may not be able to,`
` ......but I can feel the presence, like an aura, of the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`Massive, oddly shaped rocks scattered here and there. Overgrown trees and ivy.`
` ......The voices of birds and bugs.`
`Yeah, I can feel it.`
` .........I can feel...that the witch...is here......`
`Ahead, an ivy‐covered construction site fence and warning sign stood.`
`"NO ENTRY — TOKYO METROPOLIS".`
` That was written on it.`
`Oh, right.`
` When you think "Tokyo", you tend to think of a city,`
` but address‐wise, even Rokkenjima is a rightful part of Tokyo Metropolis.`
`......Apologizing to the sign for my mistaken impression, I climbed over the fence.`
`When I made it up the steep slope beyond that, ............my field of vision rapidly expanded,`
` and a fresh sea breeze blew through my hair......`
`It was like the top of a little hill.`
`......Below me was a vast view of the island.`
`I could only see desolated forest and rocky crags spread out below me.`
` ......But, somehow, I realized that the mansion was probably somewhere around there.`
`The steep downward slope beyond this hill had probably been caused by landslides from twelve years of wind and rain.`
`It had become a slant filled with crags that you might even call gentle cliffs,`
` and though it would be easy to tumble down, it looked like climbing back would be pretty difficult.`
`.........It seemed that proceeding any further would be impossible.`
`If I continued any further, I wouldn't be able to return.`
`{n}In other words, .........this is...the border.`
`Between 1986 and 1998.`
` That day and today.`
`{n}And this world and the other.`
`"............This is...`
`...this journey's...final destination, it seems."`
`As the strong wind blew Mammon and Sakutaro's hair, they looked down from the hilltop...`
`"......I can't make out a thing from here.`
` Where's the mansion?`
` Let's get closer."`
`‘Uryu, ...we can't.`
` We won't be able to come back.’`
`......We won't be able to...come back...`
`huh.`
`He's right.`
` ......This is 1998,`
` ......and I am the Ushiromiya Ange who has been left all alone.`
`At first, it was a journey to die.`
` But not anymore.`
`{n}It has become a journey to accomplish something......`
`"Yeah.`
` ......So, I'm sorry, you two.`
` As I was back then, on that day, I would have gone down this cliff without any hesitation."`
`"Come on, this is pretty lame for the skyscraper‐jumping Ushiromiya Ange."`
`"Sorry."`
`‘This place is just as good.`
` .........Because you can feel the wind of that day.’`
`"..................`
` ......Was the wind...really like this?"`
`‘Yeah.`
` They will come any moment.`
` ..................Everyone.’`
`Sakutaro said it as though it was completely natural.`
`{n}......And...I believed it.`
`Mom.`
` Dad.`
` Onii‐chan.`
`{n}All of my relatives, and those fun servants.`
`{n}And............Maria onee‐chan.`
`"It's me.`
` ......It's Ange.`
` ...............I've...come back."`
`When I started my final journey to expose the past of twelve years ago, its goal had been abstract, and I hadn't understood.`
`But now, ......I have no doubts.`
`This journey............was induced by all kinds of thoughts and fates over twelve years.`
`A journey to end things...for me, Ushiromiya Ange.`
`And a journey to end things...as the final witch of Mariage Sorcière.`
`I came here as the final daughter of the Ushiromiya family,`
` and as the final witch......`
`"......Mom, Dad, Onii‐chan.`
` ...Sorry.`
` Let me greet Maria onee‐chan first."`
`A strong gust of wind from behind urged me on.`
`That gust took just my soul out from inside my body, ......to the vast forest beneath me.`
`And, though I couldn't see it from where I stood, I believed that it would fly me to the mansion on that day,`
` to where everyone was...to where Maria onee‐chan was.`
`And so,`
` ......even though my body was on the top of the hill, a strong wind blowing against me,`
` .........my soul was now certainly dancing through that sky......`
`The vast, vast sky of Rokkenjima.`
`{n}......Below me was the green of many trees.`
`But...I can tell.`
` I can comprehend the presences of my family and relatives, and all the servants.`
` .........And...Maria onee‐chan too.`
`I could even comprehend......Maria onee‐chan as a witch.`
`It was vast, more vast than any space I had imagined up until now.`
`".........Maria onee‐chan.`
` Can you hear me......?`
` Listen......!!"`
`Ange shouted to the Maria of that day.`
`That she had been through a long journey.`
`And that she had learned just how much she had wounded Maria on that day when she was young.`
`Having understood magic, I now understand everything about the world Maria wanted to show me.`
`It is so warm, and overflowing with kindness and happiness.`
`......She had wanted to become even happier by sharing that world,`
` but I had trampled it.`
`"So now, I finally understand everything.`
` ......I understand...magic...!`
` Our magic is surely a very humble thing that exists all around us.`
` ......But it isn't something that just anyone can see with their eyes.`
` ............Magic is...`
`...yes, I can say it clearly."`
`{m:-5:—}—Without love, it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}.`
`I'm sorry, Onee‐chan.`
`......I've already been excommunicated from the witches' alliance, but...`
`{n}...after all this time, I now understand how wonderful it is.`
`And.........I know that after that day I wounded you, Mariage Sorcière was...`
`...transfigured into something different from what you truly desired.`
`.........Back in those days, even magic that allowed you to vent your anger by cursing people was probably important to you.`
`Your environment was unhappy enough for you to be allowed that.`
`"But...`
`......now, those unhappy days...are over.`
` ......So,`
` ......let's return your witches' alliance...`
`.........back to the original, gentle Mariage Sorcière."`
`The grimoire was in my hands without me realizing it.`
`......The strong winds were rapidly blowing its pages one after another......`
`It had been a kind world at first.`
`What to do to create magic so that candy rains from the sky.`
`What to do to create magic so that tomorrow's dinner becomes cream croquettes.`
`What to do to create magic so that tomorrow's weather is good when you go out, and you have a fun day.`
`New magics of happiness were created one after another, coloring her world with kindness...`
`Those days were flipped through one after another,`
` .........and the days and months began to flash by like memories...`
`The pages with drawings that were colorful...`
`gradually changed into pages colored only with black ink......`
`......Eerie magic circles, and demon summonings.`
`{n}Evil magic for harming people.`
`What to do to create magic so that the class bully catches a cold.`
`What to do to create magic so that you‐know‐who in class gets seriously injured and dies.`
`What to do to create magic so that a bus with all the bullies on it falls off a cliff.`
`Malicious magics were created one after another,`
` ......filling the pages and her heart...`
`"It was because I hurt you, Onee‐chan...`
`that Mariage Sorcière ended up like this.`
` .........You aren't a black, evil witch.`
` ......You were a white, ......pure, innocent,`
` ......kind witch......"`
`"......I'll...return you to how you were.`
` Originally, when you were scattering magic to make people happy across the entire world.`
` ......I'll turn you back into that Maria onee‐chan."`
`"......That is the reason I came here.`
` I was guided by fate.`
` ............Onee‐chan, can you hear me......?`
` Show yourself.........before me.........!!"`
`That voice rode an even stronger wind, and was sent twelve years into the past......`
`Then,`
` ......the wind gradually ceased,`
` .........and silence fell......`
`Crunch, crunch.`
` ......I could hear the sound of gravel being stepped on.`
`I heard those footsteps, and was surprised at that miracle.`
`{n}......Without a doubt, those footsteps were Maria onee‐chan's.`
`"............Ma‐......Maria onee‐chan........."`
`"Kasumi.`
` ......Looks like I finally found you, eh, Ange‐chan.........?"`
`"........................"`
`......Before I knew it, Aunt Kasumi and her black‐suits, a total of seven people who didn't resemble Maria onee‐chan in the slightest,`
` were standing there, surrounding me.`
`And it felt like my voice had been just about to reach Maria onee‐chan, too......`
`...Because of these guys' toxin, .........the magic got interrupted...`
`Ange clicked her tongue at that, but Kasumi probably didn't hear it that way.`
`"............Oh?`
` Are those flowers for your deceased family?`
` ......How admirable.`
` You're going to throw them, right?`
` That's alright, we'll wait that long."`
`......Before what.`
`{n}...Ange could more or less guess.`
`The way the black‐suits had their hands unnaturally stuck into their pockets made me realize that they were obviously in possession of handguns.`
`.........This is a deserted island.`
`{n}There could be no more convenient place to dispose of someone.`
`I have absolutely no interest in the family matters of the Sumadera family.`
`...But if I die, all of that wealth will roll right into the Sumadera family coffers.`
`Unlike me, they probably have a great deal of interest in it.`
`Of course, the Ushiromiya Group has a stake in this, too—it seems that if the massive amounts of stock I own suddenly go to the Sumaderas,`
` it'll be pretty bad for the Ushiromiya Group as well,`
` and so they've apparently gotten themselves embroiled in a secret feud over me.`
`......That's probably why President Okonogi gave me Amakusa as a guard.`
`............Having Amakusa wait on the boat was a regretful mistake...`
`"How long have you been waiting here in ambush......?"`
`"Since early morning.`
` And I was getting thoroughly tired of waiting for you.`
` There are no cafés or powder rooms here, you see."`
`"No toilets either, so I guess you had to elegantly drop a load behind a tree.`
` .........ack—"`
`"One who, in spite of herself, is a lady with half Sumadera blood flowing through her veins will not use such filthy words.`
` .........You really are Sumadera Kyrie's child, aren't you?`
` Not a trace of grace."`
`She grabbed me by the hair and forced my face up to hers.`
`{n}And then spat in it.`
`......My words are filthy, but her spit's not to be outdone.`
`".........Every time you talk about me, it's always with reference to Mom.`
` ...Am I really that much like my mother?"`
`"Yes, you are.`
` ...............That impertinent gaze.`
` Your mouth and nose are the same too."`
`"......Unrestrained and irresponsible.`
` ......She thought nothing of the long history and tradition of the Sumadera family, and selfishly flew out of the house.`
` My entire life has been wiping up the messes she left behind...!"`
`"I guess that makes your life one giant pile of shit."`
`I was slapped on the cheek, my ear took a heavy hit, and for an instant, my head rang...`
`.........She pulled me around by the hair, and threw me onto the ground.`
`And without a moment's pause, she kicked the ground, covering me in sand.`
`"Yes, you truly have become so very like Nee‐san.`
` That gaze!`
` That gaze like you're somehow making fun of me.`
` Yes, it's all coming back, all of it!"`
`".........You are pitiful.`
` I imagine that since you were young, you were always compared against Mom and looked down upon.`
` ......And for the entire rest of your life, you'll never be released from that misery."`
`"A little brat like you couldn't possibly understand.`
` ......Your mother, you see, is a loser who threw away everything and ran away from the Sumadera family.`
` Do you know how much...`
`how {i:much} trouble I went through because of that loser?!!"`
`"Any trouble you went through has nothing to do with me.`
` Can't really do anything about what happened before I was born."`
`".........When is your life going to begin?`
` ......It's never going to happen.`
` You will continue to be sneered at by my dead mother, for ever and ever for all eternity until you die.`
` ......In fact, why {i:don't} you die?`
` Why are you alive?"`
`"You little insolent pissant...!!`
` Men...!`
` Make her some tea."`
`"Heheheh...`
` Leave it to us..."`
`"You big‐mouthed shitty brat.`
` Let us teach you a little lesson."`
`The black‐suits dashed up to me, violently grabbed me by the collar, and dragged me down.`
`"Do as you like until I finish this smoke.`
` Teach my darling niece a little of her place."`
`Sumadera Kasumi.`
` She was a pitiable person, to think of it.`
`To the outside world, the women of the Sumadera family were trained to be in a position to support and defer to the men in the prominent positions.`
`......But in actuality, strong leadership was demanded of them so that they could manage all of the people under them.`
`The role demanded of them was that of a female commander.`
`Taking charge of the Sumadera family with all its proud history required an extraordinary level of commanding presence.`
`It was an unimaginably heavy responsibility.`
`Normally, this would have been demanded of Kyrie.`
`Kyrie had undergone that harsh training.`
`{n}And Kasumi, as the younger sister, should have been able to just take it easy.`
`No, in fact, she had lived like a lazy, selfish, and affluent princess, sneering at Kyrie, who had been given the heavy responsibility.`
`......However,`
` Kyrie was suddenly disinherited.`
`She had refused the fiancé her parents had arranged, and had gotten pregnant by her lover, Ushiromiya Rudolf.`
`From the Sumadera family's perspective, even though the Ushiromiya family held a vast fortune, it was a family which had already collapsed, a family not in their league.`
`And to become not even a legal wife, but a {i:lover} to the second son of that family...`
`Normally, no one would be shown mercy for something so dishonorable, not even a daughter of the main family.`
`They would wrap her up in a mat, stand a pole on end,`
` and throw her either into the Pacific Ocean if the pole fell to the right or the Sea of Japan if it fell to the left.`
`.........But Kyrie's punishment was nothing but disinheritance, an unbelievably lenient decision.`
`After that, the Sumadera family began receiving preferential treatment from a section of the Ushiromiya Group.`
` ......There must have been some kind of backroom deal.`
`In other words, Kyrie took advantage of the Ushiromiya family's financial support to leave the Sumadera family openly.`
`Kasumi watched it happen in shock.`
`{n}No, she even disparaged her dishonorable sister as a loser.`
`......But eventually...`
`...she learned that the heavy responsibilities Kyrie had borne would be passed on to her,`
` and then, for the first time, she realized that she had been outwitted......`
`"Because of your mother, my life was turned into a mess.`
` ......No, you could even say she killed me once.`
` On that day, I was killed once and cast down into a hellish life..."`
`".........Isn't that just what you get for thinking you can breeze through life?`
` ......gyack!`
` .........*cough*, *cough*......"`
`"This girl doesn't know when to shut up!`
` Oorrrrah!"`
`The black‐suit punched me in the gut, and I doubled over.`
`{n}But I was quickly grabbed by the collar and made to stand up again.`
`As she continued to cold‐heartedly look down upon Ange, Kasumi blew out smoke......`
`{n}The hard days after Kyrie left were floating through her mind.`
`Until then, she had been allowed to be simply a rich young lady, unrestrained and unaffected.`
`{n}......Only Kyrie, the older sister, had been strictly trained, and she, the younger sister, had been able to live as nothing more than a princess.`
`Then, suddenly, everything was turned over to such a degree that her life tumbled and crashed......`
`"My life, lifestyle, way of living, ......everything was stolen from me.`
` .........Do you know how much I was maligned based on my sister's dishonor by those relatives who didn't know the details...?`
` ......I detested her.`
` I detested your mother enough to make me spit blood..."`
`"Glad to hear it.`
` I hope it continues for many years to come.`
` .........gagghh!!"`
`A kick landed in Ange's side as she lay prostrate on the ground.`
`{n}Ange didn't stand up again.`
`......So she continued to lie there like a caterpillar, getting kicked every time she spoke up.`
`"......I saw Nee‐san at an Ushiromiya Group party once.`
` ......She was with her husband,`
` .........looking very happy,`
` ......and laughing.`
` ......She...`
`...pushed everything onto me,`
` ......and found happiness...`
`......only for herself........."`
`".........So what?`
` How is taking it out on me going to make you happy?`
` Is taking it out on me going to turn back time and change history for you or something?"`
`".........Ugugggh,`
` .........gah,`
` .........*cough*......!!"`
`"You said something a short while ago...`
` When is my life going to begin?`
` .........No matter how much I despise you or take it out on you, I cannot turn back time.`
` ......So am I doomed to keep on hating Nee‐san like this for the rest of my life, even though she's dead?"`
`"Not if I can help it.`
` ......How long must I be tormented by Nee‐san's ghost?`
` And so I thought.`
` .........If I could pull this off, I would be able to forget all of my hatred and start over."`
`Ange was about to respond to this with another bitter comment, but stopped.`
`{n}...Because she would be kicked again if she responded.`
`......Even if Kasumi didn't say any more, it wasn't difficult to imagine what she meant.`
`{n}Kasumi was thinking of bringing an end to her hatred of Kyrie by taking revenge against her daughter, Ange.`
`.........Talk about pushing your problems on other people.`
`"Come on, stand up.`
` If you like this island that much, I'll bury you here deep.`
` .........You don't want to die at your age, right?`
` Don't you want to say "Sorry my mother caused you so much trouble", or something?"`
`".........You...`
`...wish.`
` .........gkkhhh,`
` .........glk, ......!!"`
`‘Uryuu!!`
` Ange, Angeeeeee...!!’`
`"Ange‐sama, no...!`
` You mustn't provoke these guys...!!`
` You should at least make it seem like you're going along with them, so you can buy some time...!"`
`".........They do say...`
`that you should throw your foolish pride...`
`out with the garbage......"`
`‘Wh‐what about Amakusa‐san...?!`
` If Amakusa‐san comes, I just know he'll......!’`
`"......No, it's no good, I can't see him...`
` ......You idiot, Ange‐sama...!`
` Why did you come without Amakusa...!"`
`I don't need you to tell me that, Mammon.`
`{n}......I'm already right in the middle of regretting it.`
`I walked a long way to get here.`
` The forest was very thick.`
`{n}......There's no way that the disturbance here will reach the boat......`
`As Kasumi took her sweet time smoking that single cigarette down to the filter,`
` I was continuously laid into by the black‐suits however they deemed fit.`
`The moment I grabbed my head to protect it, the top of my head was kicked by someone at a bad angle, and my head filled with stars......`
`{n}This feeling of stars flickering in a world twisted with gray...`
`...was one I knew well.`
`My life was very similar to the one Sumadera Kasumi led.`
`...Because I was tormented constantly with all kinds of bullying under the guise of education and training, to make me a worthy "successor to the Ushiromiya family".`
`Yes.`
` Having the inside of my head filled with stars like this...is a feeling I know well.`
`When being reprimanded for some error in manners I seemed to have made,`
` the lecture always turned to whether I was fitting to be the successor to the Ushiromiya family or not.`
`......On and on about the honor of the Ushiromiya family, and how important it was.`
`......By the time her rant reached that point,`
` I would forget what mistake I was being blamed for in the first place.`
`No, actually, it was the same way for Aunt Eva too.`
`After all, sometimes she would ask herself "Umm, what was I saying again?"`
`...But in the end, she wouldn't be able to remember, and would say something like:`
`"The fact that I'm angry must mean that you did something wrong.`
` So whatever wrong thing you did is the problem, and it isn't important that I can't remember what it was any more."`
`...There'd be some ridiculous reasoning like that, and then she would continue punishing me.`
`Yes.`
` Aunt Eva's punishments weren't something that would continue until I learned something, or acknowledged my mistake, or apologized.`
`.........They would continue until Aunt Eva wanted to stop.`
`{n}So even this violence was a bit nostalgic, in a way that made me want to vomit.`
`......I opened my eyes, ......and oh look, there's Aunt Eva.`
`Right next to Kasumi, who was smoking her cigarette,`
` I could see Aunt Eva, the two of them looking almost as though they were laughing at me together.`
`When I think about it, even Aunt Eva's life might be worthy of sympathy.`
`......The responsibilities and pressures of members of the Ushiromiya family, which she had so often mentioned to me,`
` were all things that she herself had suffered.`
`Because people cannot voice insults that they have never been subjected to themselves......`
`It was probably the same way for Aunt Rosa as well.`
`{n}......As the youngest child of the glorious Ushiromiya family, she must have gone through many tough times.`
`So, just as Aunt Eva acted towards me...`
`{n}And just as Sumadera Kasumi is acting right now...`
`{n}......Aunt Rosa must also...have been the same.`
`People push the suffering they have been made to bear onto other people.`
`{n}Otherwise, they can never escape from it.`
`......So on and on, in eternity and perpetuity, the chain of suffering and sadness never ends.`
`That is the reason............Maria onee‐chan's magic was...`
`...so incredible.`
`With her magic, ......she did not have to bear the suffering from Aunt Rosa.`
`That pain was probably pushed onto her.`
`{n}Its weight probably tormented her.`
`......But Onee‐chan did not carry that burden on her own shoulders.`
`.........She exorcised it...and filled her world with happiness.`
`So, I'm sure...`
`...that even if Maria onee‐chan had had children in the future...`
`...she would never have pushed the suffering forced down through the generations onto them.`
`......The chain of suffering and sadness,`
` which had been inherited by and forced upon each generation for who knows how long,`
` .........was, by Maria onee‐chan's magic, broken.`
`"............What is it?`
` Do you have something to complain to me about?"`
`In the past, I would have snapped back.`
`{n}......And cancelled out her hatred with hatred of my own.`
`...No, I cancelled out nothing.`
` The weight of that which had been forced onto her bears down hard on my shoulders as well.`
`After all, even now, ......I hate her.`
`So,`
` ............now that I knew of magic,`
` ......I looked at the human called Ushiromiya Eva again.`
`.........What I could see through to...`
`...was the sad form of a human, no different from me, who had lost her family and who bore deep wounds in her heart.`
`Unable to withstand the pain of that torn heart,`
` she was doing nothing except howling with a sad voice—like a lion crying in pain—like a child.`
`......It turns out...Ushiromiya Eva was also a person deserving of compassion.`
`She had needed someone to understand the difficulties and pain of her childhood days,`
` .........and she, too, as the only survivor of the Rokkenjima incident,`
` who was faced with the inquisitive eyes of all of society, who was publicly slandered, who had salt continually rubbed into her wounds,`
` ......had needed someone's compassion.`
`In order to let her forget her pain and sorrow for least a moment,`
` ............the black witch, the very same that possessed Aunt Rosa, ......taught her magic.`
`It was the same magic of anger and sadness that {f:5:Beatrice} had taught Maria onee‐chan,`
` when she was mourning for Sakutarou after he was torn apart.`
`......That same magic, that witch, had surely dwelled inside Aunt Rosa too.`
`............So I was wrong to hate Ushiromiya Eva.`
`...Perhaps...`
`......I alone was supposed to have become her ally,`
` the only person in the world who could understand her.`
`......What did I say to her when I was young, when she returned alive all alone...?`
`Could it be...`
`......that the way I acted towards her was...`
`......as if she had come back by herself after killing all my family......?`
`...........................`
` ......I can't believe it.`
`...Aunt Eva, who throughout my life has never been more than an object of and synonym for hatred,`
` .........is turning into a...{i:human} who I can understand......`
`And so.`
` .........I looked right next to Aunt Eva, ......at the form of the black witch who taught her the black magic......`
`Aunt Eva...was crying.`
`It was only natural.`
`.........Not only did she have no one who would understand her pain of having lost her husband and son all at once,`
` ......but even I, her only relative, insulted her, ......saying "Give me back my mom and dad".`
`.........I can make the excuse that it was the mercilessness of youth.`
`...But......to her at the time,`
` that was probably cruel enough to sever her heart's last thread.`
`..................In the following days, the talk shows and magazines publicly slandered her.`
`The truths of her late husband's business and character, and even those about her beloved son, were denied.`
`She no longer had anything left.`
`She could do nothing but cry and howl, ......trying to forget the pain and sadness for just a few moments.`
`Because only while howling could she feel the slightest bit of release.`
`And so, .........the black witch taught her how to howl.`
`The one I hated...was the black witch.`
` The black magic probably did release her from that suffering for just a short time.`
`......However,`
` it would never lift that weight from her shoulders.`
`To the contrary, it would force that weight on further victims,`
` .........filling the world with the weight of hatred.`
`...............If Aunt Eva was to have a true witch nearby, one who knew of white magic...`
`......wasn't that...`
`.........supposed to be...`
`...me.........?`
`I had learned the magic to create happiness from Maria onee‐chan.`
`.........If I could have saved her......with that magic,`
` ...............might we not have...`
`......built up a future with a completely different relationship?`
`All this time,`
` .........I have hated Aunt Eva.`
`{n}...So I never noticed the black witch beside her.`
`......Without love, it couldn't be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}.`
`{n}I didn't have...`
`...any love for her......`
`So now, finally...`
`.........I'll glare at the black witch,`
` ......the one I truly should hate.`
`"......Oh?`
` .........What's thiiis?`
` You can {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} me?`
` Ehheheheheh...!"`
`"..................Yes, I can.`
` ......The one I should've hated wasn't Aunt Eva.`
` ......It was you."`
`"Hey, you're pretty good.`
` To think that a lowly {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} could {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} a witch like me.`
` ......And so?`
` Are you trying to say something with that glare?`
` Do you hate me?"`
`"...............Hate?`
` ......Yes, I do.`
` ......But...that's not quite it.`
` ......I just...find you a little sad."`
`"Sad?`
` `
`......*giggle*giggle*, ahhahahahahaha!`
` What're you saying, come on, you can get mad!`
` Why don't you just hate me with all your strength forever?!"`
`"......I won't hate.`
` ......Hating you...`
`......means I'm doing nothing more than inheriting Aunt Eva's hatred.`
` ......I'll break the hatred.`
` ......I'll accept Aunt Eva's suffering, .........exorcise it, and throw it away."`
`"Ahhahahahahahahaha!!`
` What kind of epiphany do you think you've had?`
` Is your head alright?`
` I mean, why don't you just give up and die foreveeeer?!"`
`"Kyaahhahhahahahahahaha!`
` You guys, kick her more and more, okay?`
` Not her face, though.`
` It wouldn't do any good kicking her pitiful face only to make it better!"`
`"Guhhkk!`
` .........*cough*!!`
` ...............g'......"`
`The black‐suits persistently kicked my stomach and back.`
`{n}......As though they had been ordered to by the black witch.`
`"......Dear me, still nothing to you, is it......?`
` ............You keep staring right at me.`
` You hate me?`
` I'll bet you do.`
` I hate you too.`
` *snicker*snicker*snicker*......"`
`Kasumi sneered at me.`
` ......But for some reason, I had the feeling that she was crying behind that expression.`
`She's had a life just as unfair as mine forced upon her, and the pain of that never, ever heals.`
`......The sad lion continues to howl, gasping in pain from the thorn he can't get out...`
`"Hey, Sumadera Kasumi, take a look.`
` That over there is what you used to be."`
`"......Doesn't that make you feel so much better?`
` You used to be standing there, but now you're on this side, you know that?`
` Eheheheh, isn't it delightful?`
` Now the shoe is on the other foot!"`
`"...............Yes, it truly does feel...`
`......delightful.........`
` Ahhahahahaha, how can you make that kind of face, Ange...?!`
` Go on and cry, you want to, right?!"`
`"Kyahhahahahahahaha!!`
` Yes, yes, of course she wants to cry!`
` Go on, make her cry."`
`"You were made to cry back then, weren't you?`
` So make her cry too.`
` *giggle*, and Ange, it's alright, okay?`
` Why not cry foreveeeeeeeer?!`
` Kyaaaha‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"`
`"...Aha, ...ahahahahahahaha!!`
` Cry, Angeee!`
` I want to see your crying face!`
` Cry, and try saying "I'm sorry, Aunt Kasumi"...!!"`
`"Yes, make her say those words.`
` ......Those words hurt, right?`
` Being made to apologize for something that isn't your fault......hurt a lot, didn't it......?"`
`"Make her go through the same thing...`
` By doing that, you can relieve your pain."`
`"......Ehheheheh, yes, that's the way.`
` Be more honest with yourself.`
` Why not spit out your emotions more and more and more foreveeeeeeeer?!"`
`......The black witch stirred Kasumi up.`
`{n}And Kasumi began to give herself over to that dark emotion.`
`......She was doing nothing more than turning her deep sadness into cheap booze and forcing it down,`
` trying to forget for just a brief moment.`
`The words Kasumi insulted me with...`
`......were themselves...`
`...sad.`
`And...I couldn't forgive the black witch for taking advantage of Kasumi's sadness.........`
`.........I had gone limp on the ground, which seemed to have sapped the black‐suits of their enthusiasm for kicking.`
`...Or maybe the kickers had finally gotten tired too.`
`Kasumi hadn't ordered them to stop, but at some point, the violence had halted.`
`However, I was reflected in Kasumi's eyes, and they were burning me with flames of hatred.`
`......She had been tempted by the witch into doing that in order to relieve her own pain.`
`".........Sumadera Kasumi.`
` You aren't done.`
` You've got much more trampling to do.`
` Can you forgive what happened to your entire life with just this little bit of violence?"`
`"...I can't forgive what happened.`
` ......It'll take a lot more than this for me to forgive that."`
`"Right?`
` There's no way you can forgive!`
` Do it more!`
` More of the flames of hatred!`
` Nothing can warm you except the flames of hate.`
` You are freezing in the snow fields of anger and sadness, and the only flame that can warm you up is hatred...!!"`
`"Come on, say it!`
` Scream it!!`
` Why don't you burn yourself to ashes with a roar of hate foreveeeeeeer?!"`
`"U‐......USHIROMIYA ANGEEEEEEEEE!!`
` Loathing you......is what allows me to draw breath!!`
` Ehhehe{0}he{0}ha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"Sumadera Kasumi, that bouquet of flowers.`
` .........These flowers are for your dead family, right, Ange?"`
`The black witch grinned at me unpleasantly, and used her chin to signal Kasumi to pick them up.`
`Kasumi picked up the flowers I was going to offer,`
` .........brought them all the way over to me, dropped them in front of me, and made a show of trampling them...`
`Her expression was filled with hatred, ......and a frantic quality that simple hatred couldn't explain.`
`...It was as if trampling them over and over again was the only way to prevent the sadness inside her from reaching the bursting point.`
`So the sound of her trampling was downright sad.`
`".........Oh, this isn't enough to get to you?`
` Then what about this?`
` Sumadera Kasumi!`
` Use this one."`
`"......N‐.........no......`
` ...Not that........."`
`The object the black witch pointed at.........was Maria onee‐chan's grimoire.`
`Kasumi also noticed it, and picked up that book, which was heavier than it looked...`
`"What's thiiis?"`
`"*giggle*.`
` ......Why not read it and laugh forever?`
` Eheheh, you might split your sides laughing..."`
`Kasumi opened the grimoire,`
` ......skimmed over the contents, and snorted derisively.`
`"Give it back......`
` That's......Onee‐chan's............"`
`Of course, my hand couldn't reach.`
`......My stomach was once again kicked by the black‐suits, and I curled up on the ground...`
`"See?`
` See how important this book is to Ange?`
` Mock the things that are important to her.`
` That works better than punching or kicking for a girl like her.`
` ......You know that better than anyone, right...?"`
`Kasumi's face twisted for an instant, as though remembering something painful.`
`......But that quickly disappeared, changing into a scornful smile directed towards me.`
`"*giggle*giggle*.`
` Wowww, what a freaky book.`
` ......Did you write this.........?"`
`"......Stop it...... Give it back........."`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*!!`
` Look at that face...!`
` Mock it more, mock it more...!`
` Teach her the pain of having your dignity trampled, that's the only way to soften your own pain...!"`
`"Heh, heheheheh, what's with this embarrassing book...`
` ............I know some people develop a little interest in make‐believe fortune telling when they're young girls."`
`"But isn't this taking it a bit too far?`
` Oh god, it says "magic".`
` ......You're one of those, aren't you.`
` You know, that thing in cartoons where they say some "blabbity‐blibbity‐woo" spell and transform into a witch.`
` You're one of those people who like doing that, aren't you?`
` .........This is just painful.`
` *snicker*snicker*."`
`Cackling, Kasumi opened to a random page and showed it to the black‐suits.`
`The black‐suits looked too, and guffawed.`
`That laughter wouldn't wound me.`
`......But I couldn't forgive it.`
` ...After all, that laughter was ridiculing Maria onee‐chan.`
`I don't hate Kasumi.`
` ......For exploiting Kasumi's unhealing anger and sadness, ......I cannot forgive the black witch...`
`That black witch ate into Aunt Eva, Sumadera Kasumi, and Aunt Rosa,`
` ......tormenting them for an eternity without letting their wounds be healed.`
`.........I can't forgive her......`
`{n}......I can't forgive.........the black witch......`
`"Oh my god, this is priceless...!`
` ......Magic for making candy rain from the sky, ......it says!!`
` Ahhaha{0}hahaha...!"`
`"Let's see.`
` Dissolve sugar in cold water purified by the sun...?`
` Dip the magic wand in, and say the incantation, .........*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!`
` What the hell?!`
` Ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!`
` Criiiiiiiiinge!!"`
`The black‐suits also rolled around, guffawing.`
`Then, grinning, the black witch whispered something into Kasumi's ear.`
`......Then, after glaring at me with a grin, ......Kasumi took that page—`
`"......Ah—"`
`Kasumi grabbed hold of that page, tore it out, crumpled it up, ......and threw it away......`
`‘Th‐......that's so mean... ......That was...Maria's magic.........’`
`"Oh, really?`
` Heheh, how sad."`
`......It was one of the magics to summon happiness...`
`...that Maria had made with Sakutarou.`
`Anyone knows that making sugar water, coloring it with paint, and leaving it by the window...`
`...isn't going to make candy rain from the sky.`
`But after repeating that every day, ......one time when she got back from school...`
`...she found several pieces of candy scattered around that place...`
`.........How happy must that miracle have made Maria onee‐chan.`
`......What good care she must have taken of those candies, savoring them during her nights all alone with Sakutarou, to distract herself from her loneliness.`
`That......magic which Onee‐chan had created...`
`......was torn out, thrown away,`
` ...and disappeared......`
`The entire miracle of happiness created by that magic,`
` ......she tore out and threw away......`
`"Oh, this one's another classic...!`
` Magic to make dinner be cream croquettes?`
` Ahhaha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!`
` ......What's this next one?`
` Magic to make bell peppers taste nice?`
` This is amazing, ridiculous!`
` Ah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah...!!"`
`"Tear that too.`
` Eheheh!!`
` Why not tear it more and more foreveeeeeer?!?!"`
`With a cruel‐hearted, loud laugh,`
` ......the black witch made her tear out Maria onee‐chan's magics one after another......`
`She...sneered at those happy magics,`
` ......ripped them out,`
` ......and threw them away......`
`"Stop it... Stop it......!!`
` Don't......defile Lady {f:5:Maria}'s magic...!!`
` Don't defile it......with your filthy toxin...!!"`
`Mammon cried and yelled, ......but she had no way of reaching Kasumi.`
`"Who cares, why don't you just be defiled foreveeeer?!`
` Magical miracles?`
` Magic to bring happiness?`
` Doesn't exist, there's no such thing!"`
`"Pain and suffering, you see, can only be healed by pushing them onto someone else.`
` ......Now you, you were what they call a "magic friend", right?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Sumadera Kasumi, open up to her page."`
`"What's this?`
` Magic friends, it says.`
` ............The Seven Sisters of Purgatory?"`
`"Ahah, what a creepy name!`
` *giggle*, it says they can fly at awesome speeds, and finish off the enemy for you.`
` Ahhaha, Ange, if you can use this kind of magic, shouldn't you use it right now?`
` .........Ahhaha{0}hahaha.`
` Stupid!"`
`The pages that wrote of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory were also heartlessly torn away.`
`......The pages themselves were just paper.`
`{n}They weren't Mammon's vessel or anything.`
`But the tearing, denying toxin burned Mammon from the inside......`
`Mammon's face twisted from the heat and pain...`
`".........ghhh, ...............kkkhhh, ........."`
`‘Are you okay, Mammon?!`
` Hang in there......!!’`
`"......I can......handle it...`
` ......It's not me......but Ange‐sama.........who's in pain........."`
`However, Mammon's expression was twisted in unbearable pain and humiliation......`
`‘Stop it, black witch......!!`
` Why are you doing something like this?!`
` Why......can't you use magic for happiness?!!’`
`"......Oh, you're a magic friend too, right?`
` *giggle*, I'll defile you too.`
` Sumadera Kasumi, look for this guy's page, too."`
`"What's this one?`
` What's with this crappy scribble of a lion?`
` ......Sakutarou?`
` What a weird name!`
` My best friend, it says.`
` Really?`
` This is your friend? Your close friend?`
` This lion is? Is it, is it?"`
`"Ahhahahahahahaha!!`
` It really is a crappy scribble.`
` So this butt‐ugly lion is you."`
`"To think she had something like this as a friend... That Ushiromiya Maria kid's mind is so unbelievably wretched my sides are hurting.`
` .........What a morrrrron.`
` Why not give up and die foreveeeeeer......?"`
`‘U...ryu......`
` .........Don't make fun......of Maria......’`
`"...............St......op......it.........`
` ...Don't rip it........."`
`""No waay.""`
`There was a shrill tearing sound.`
` .........And the page was filthily ripped out...`
`The picture of Sakutarou...`
`...that Onee‐chan had drawn...`
`...was violently ripped in half.........`
`"What a shhhhhitty drawi~ng.`
` Kyahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!"`
`"You all laugh too.`
` Aahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!"`
`Obeying the pair, the black‐suits laughed crudely,`
` ......and heartlessly trampled all over the paper that had been torn and thrown away......`
`‘Uuuuuuuuuuuu, ......hic!`
` ......Uuuuuuuuuuu......’`
`"......Sakutaro, ......be strong........."`
`‘I'm...not sad......`
` ...I just......can't stand it......`
` ......Maria's being made fun of,`
` .........and I can't do anything about it...`
` ......I can't stand it......’`
`"........................`
` ......To {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s who can't {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} us, ......it's as though we don't exist...`
` ......We can only interact with {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s that need us.`
` ............That's why.........we're furniture........."`
`As Sakutarou and Mammon......supported each other,`
` ......they slumped down, ...sobbing...`
`I couldn't stand it either......`
` ......Only those who can {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} the world of magic can understand how wonderful it is.`
`It can't be explained to humans who can't understand.`
` And so it is mocked.`
`{n}.........If only you could show it...`
`......But you can't......`
`Because, in front of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s who are filled with the anti‐magic toxin and who can't understand magic,`
` .........magic cannot be used......`
`"I really don't get it.`
` From this delusional diary, I've got to assume that something's wrong with your head.`
` ......It really is interesting to take a peek into your happy‐go‐lucky little mind.`
` You creepy child."`
`"You and Maria.`
` ......And that stuffed animal and the furniture over there too.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!`
` Ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!"`
`"Aah, I could laugh.`
` You don't have any friends, do you?`
` You're allllways all alone, and stuffed animals are your friends, right?`
` What a pitiable child."`
`"Ehheheheheheheheheh...!`
` Don't worry, I understand.`
` I know what it's like to live that way.`
` .........So I'll be the one to recognize you for what you are.`
` You really are a pitiful little child.`
` Ehhehehha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!"`
`.........So, to you,`
` ......she looks like a pitiful child.`
`Yes, I'm sure she does.`
`If a hundred people were to read Onee‐chan's diary and grimoire, all one hundred would probably get that same impression.`
`......I used to be one of them.`
`But you know,`
` .........in spite of all that,`
` ......Maria onee‐chan...`
`...still called this a world of happiness.`
`.........Don't deny...`
`......that magic, ...that happiness......`
`"Such a stubborn child, you are.`
` ......Alright, fine.`
` This is the last one.`
` I'll tear apart the source of the absolutely ridiculous magic that you and Maria believed in.`
` Sumadera Kasumi, read this page."`
`"Hmmm, what is this colorful page......?`
` ...Let's see.`
` .........Magic to...`
`...always be friends with Mama who I love...?"`
`‘N‐noooooooooo!!`
` Not that page......!!’`
`"Oh?`
` This magic is really simple.`
` I think even I could do it without any practice at all.`
` .........Even I can remember an incantation this short.`
` Shall I give it a go?"`
`"*giggle*giggle*, it really is a short incantation, isn't it?`
` Alright, give it a try, let's all burst it out!"`
`With expressions that ridiculed it from the bottoms of their hearts, the black witch and Kasumi......puckered their lips in the most exaggerated way they could,`
` ............and said it aloud......`
`"Uu‐uu."`
`The black‐suits stared blankly, asking what that was supposed to be.`
`{n}Then Kasumi answered, cackling.`
`"This is supposed to be the "incantation".`
` Are you kidding me...!`
` Ahhahahahahahaha...!!!"`
`"Come on, why don't you guys try it too?`
` Uu‐uu‐uu."`
`The black‐suits imitated that moaning voice, making fun of it......`
`{m:-5:———}—“Uu‐uu.”`
`{n}That was the incantation...for the magic that would let her always be friends with the mama she loved.`
`"What is this stupidity...!!`
` If you could make family relationships better just by saying "uu‐uu", we would have world peace forever.`
` Ahah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!!"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!`
` A stupid moaning voice!`
` If you do this over and over again, people are going to think you're a poor kid with mental problems!`
` Are you retarrrrrded?!`
` Waaahahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha, waaaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`‘Stoooooop...... At least don't mock......that magiiiiiiiic......’`
`............One day when Maria onee‐chan and Aunt Rosa had gone on a picnic together.`
`It was written that this was one of the five happiest days of her life.`
`And Onee‐chan was singing her mama a song that she had just learned from her.`
`......Onee‐chan was happy to see that her mama was enjoying it very much.`
` But partway through, she forgot the lyrics.`
`But her mama was enjoying it so much, so she tried to sing until the very end.`
`With "uu‐uu‐uu".`
`......She sung it with fake lyrics, but her mama was very pleased......`
`After that, "uu" remained as an incantation to remember that day she had spent in fun and happiness with her mama.`
`Of course, even though Aunt Rosa thought it funny at first, eventually she tired of hearing it,`
` and later on, started to scold Onee‐chan whenever she said it,`
` ......but to Onee‐chan, it was a memory of a fun day that she could never forget......`
`So among the magics that Maria created, it was the oldest and the first......`
`Kasumi stuck her fingernails into that page too......`
`"......Stop,`
` ............don't tear it......`
` At least spare...`
`......that page........."`
`"Ehheheheheheheheheh!`
` No waay!!"`
`............With a shrill sound, a girl's world of happiness...`
`was...`
`erased.`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!`
` Aaaa‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah, aaaaahah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!`
` Is this your magic of happiness?`
` Hilarious, hilarious...!!"`
`"Why would you ever think that magic could make people happy?!`
` Magic—listen now—is made of...anger...and hatred!"`
`"Happiness is what you call the feeling of release you get only when you've pushed all of the hatred you bear onto someone else.`
` The happiness you all are talking about is a phantom that doesn't show up outside picture books!!"`
`As Kasumi laughed her head off, she slammed the grimoire against the ground, and stepped on it.`
`"Can't stand it?`
` Well? Can't stand it?!`
` You white witches of happiness?`
` If you can't stand it that much, why don't you show us?!`
` Show us your magic!!"`
`"If it exists, then you just have to use it and show us, riiiiight?`
` .........A witch that can't use magic isn't a witch!!`
` So we are the real witches.`
` You're just brats trying to escape reality with a dream of magic!!"`
`...............Then,`
` .........if I can show you magic, ......will you...`
`......believe in Onee‐chan's magic.........?`
`"Huh?`
` Kyahhahahaha, oh yes, oh yes!!`
` I'll believe!`
` If you {i:can} use magic and show me, that i~s!!`
` Go on then, do it, you shit‐for‐brains little braaaaaat!!"`
`...........................`
` .........`
`Silently, slowly,`
` ......I stood up.`
` ......The sensations of this small world, such as the pain in my body, felt truly insignificant......`
`"Oh, looks like you've still got enough energy to stand up, Miss Great Witch?`
` *snicker*snicker*!"`
`"Now that you've stood up, what are you going to show us?`
` Go on, show us your magiiic...!"`
`".....................Magic...exists."`
`"Whaa?`
` What's this kid coming out with now...?!`
` Did you guys hear that?!"`
`"Quiet!!!`
` ............Heh, isn't that interesting.`
` ...You people have always declined to show this power of miracles because of the anti‐magic toxin.`
` .........Disciple of the white witch {f:5:Maria}.`
` Try showing me magic...!!"`
`"..........................."`
`"......Do you have any clue how many humans have believed in that miracle and been betrayed?"`
`".........*giggle*.`
` Every one of them believed!`
` Every one of them was betrayed and despaired!`
` And they all learn that true magic can only be gained by the power of black witches like me...!!"`
`"...............Taking your hatred out on someone else is nothing more than a crime.`
` That isn't magic.`
` .........I'll show you what real magic is."`
`"...............Y‐you..............."`
`The black witch winced slightly.`
`{n}However, Kasumi sneered at me even more.`
`"Show me, then.`
` So? What kind of magic are you going to show me?`
` Magic to make candy rain from the sky?`
` Or else magic to make cookies multiply?"`
`"............Wagh?!"`
`The instant I opened my eyes, a tremendous wind arose.`
`"Wh‐......what is this, all of a sudden.........?!"`
`"Come, arise, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory."`
`".........Whaaat......"`
`There was a flash behind me, and in an instant, seven high‐level furniture were gathered there.`
`{n}It was a power that far surpassed the magical power I'd had in my prime.`
`{n}It was a power that matched even Maria onee‐chan and {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`"The Seven Sisters of Purgatory, right here...!!"`
`"......A‐Ange‐sama......!"`
`"You said it once.`
` ......Because I lacked magical power and resolve,`
` ......I could not use you or your sisters.`
` ............This isn't some cheap emotion, like wanting to get back at my bullying classmates."`
`"...In order to protect Maria onee‐chan's, .........Mariage Sorcière's world,`
` ......I now order you to show me the miracle of magic."`
`"I‐it's impossible...`
` There's just no way, not with such a mass of toxin in front of us........."`
`The Seven Sisters also remembered what had once happened in that classroom.`
`{n}......If they could have obeyed Ange's order, they would have.`
`......However, ......surrounded by the toxin that runs thick in {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, they hadn't been able to display the miracle of magic.`
`......And they remembered very well how deeply that had hurt Ange......`
`But Ange spoke very quietly.`
`"In that case.`
` You all believe too."`
`"......Huh?"`
`"............Mariage Sorcière was created to make people happy.`
` ...And also to fight the black witch."`
`"The foolish black witch denies the world created by one of the founders, the Witch of Origins, Lady {f:5:Maria}.`
` ......In order to show her that miracle,`
` ......and in order to protect that world,`
` .........believe.`
` In magic.`
` In witches.`
` Right now—in the miracle...!"`
`Kasumi gave an order to the black‐suits, and one of them took out a gun and pointed it at Ange.`
`"You're going to show us magic, right?`
` Then show us, if you would.`
` Use magic to shoot this man down with a fireball or lightning or something."`
`"You get one chance.`
` .........Show us before I count to three, alright?`
` If you can't, then you had best prepare yourself, okay?`
` Ehheheheheh!"`
`"...........................`
` ..................Shoot me."`
`"What's with this kid.`
` Hehheheh, she's fuckin' crazy."`
`The black‐suit pointing the gun laughed at Ange's composure.`
`"Ahhahahahahaha!!`
` Are you serious?!`
` This girl's living in cloud cuckoo land!`
` In that case, get yourself shot! Why don't you just die foreveeeeeeer?!"`
`‘Ange...!!`
` ......I‐it's impossible!`
` You can't block bullets with magic......!!’`
`"No.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of.`
` ............To my magic, to the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, bullets are like nothing."`
`"A‐Ange‐sama........."`
`Mammon was flustered by Ange's absolute trust.`
`{n}......She would have loved to live up to that trust, if only she could.`
` On that day as well.`
`But, ......she had been unable to do anything, and she had hurt Ange.........`
`"Hehheheh, you little shit.`
` You can use magic, huh? Then goddamn show us already."`
`"What's the hold up?`
` Show us some magic, right now!!"`
`"Come on, no need to hold back!`
` Shazow!`
` Blast me with some magic, I dare ya!!`
` Hihhehhehheh!"`
`The black‐suits jeered at her.`
`{n}But Ange simply concentrated her mind in silence......`
`"Why not just shoot and kill her forever?!`
` She's even telling you to shoot her!"`
`"......This kid's already lost her mind from fear.`
` Bye‐bye, Ange‐chan.`
` ......Go and play witches as much as you want in heaven.`
` ......Shoot her."`
`"Heheh, you sure?"`
`"Shoot!`
` Die, Ange!!"`
`"Magic it up, brat, if you can!!!"`
`The black‐suit cocked the gun, and, sneering, he...pulled the trigger.`
`"................................."`
`A gunshot rang out,`
` .........and the world...stopped.`
`A red spray scattered,`
` .........and chunks of flesh flew.`
`"...uh, ...............ah......"`
`"What are you doing, Mammon?`
` ......You would let this boorish pebble of a bullet reach Ange‐sama?"`
`Lucifer had lined up the bullet perfectly, and with a single swing, ......had sliced it in two......`
`And......in the chest of the black‐suit who had apparently fired the gun......there was a hole as big as a fist...`
`".........Every once in a while,`
` it's alright for me to go first, right?"`
`Half of Leviathan's body was covered with blood, and she wore a cold smile.`
`......Then, slowly, .........the pitiful prey that she had brought down...fell over.`
`"Y‐......you pierced...a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}......!!!"`
`"Idiot!`
` Do you still not believe?!`
` In our master's magic power...!!"`
`"Are......you...kidding me.........?!?!`
` You ma‐manifested...in front of this many {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s?!?!"`
`"Wh‐.........what the...what?!"`
`Kasumi and the rest were thrown into confusion...`
`He certainly seemed to have fired the gun......`
`{n}However,`
` ......it hadn't hit Ange,`
` .........and why...`
`...was the person who fired...`
`...instead......?!`
`"......This is...magic.`
` ......Great job, Leviathan."`
`"I am most honored...!!`
` You foolish {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s who dare oppose our master!`
` Now is the time of judgment! Prostrate yourselves!!"`
`"H‐how......?!!!`
` You shouldn't be able to bring magic into the world of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s...!!`
` They shouldn't be able to {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} magic, they shouldn't be able to be touched by magic!!`
` ......How?!!"`
`"............Because this...is true magic."`
`"...... ......aaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAA...!!"`
`"Wh‐what are you people doing?!`
` K‐kill her, kill her!!!"`
`One of the black‐suits who had finally come to his senses pulled his gun, aimed,`
`"Did you think I'd overlook the disrespect of pointing a gun at our master......?`
` Die."`
`Those words were his funeral.`
` ......The man had already been struck through the chest by Lucifer, who had become the Stake of Pride in an instant.`
`Thump!`
` The sound of the second person falling brought it home to the black‐suits that their lives were unmistakably in peril...!!`
`"Aaa...waaaaaaaagggh!! Hel‐hel‐heeeeelllllp......!!!"`
`Almost paralyzed with fright, the man turned on his heels in an attempt to escape from that place,`
` ......and in that instant, the Stake of Sloth......`
`"............Be thankful that this is the only recompense for your violence against our master.`
` Die!!"`
`A hole as big as a walnut opened in his right eye, and his head split.`
`Belphegor was sprayed with blood, and her face twisted demonically with the joy of being able to use her full power...!`
`"Ahh...waaaaaaagghhh?!`
` Who?!`
` Who's there?!`
` Where are you?!"`
`The black‐suits panicked, pointing their guns in every direction.`
`{n}But they didn't understand what was happening.`
`They only knew that something terrifying was coming for them from somewhere,`
` but they didn't know where...!!`
`"Idiots!!`
` Th‐the enemy is right in front of you!`
` The witch's furniture is after you!!!"`
`But they could not {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see}...!!`
`{n}Because they couldn't believe in magic, they could not {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see}...!!`
`Just as the black witch said, Satan was standing boldly right in front of the black‐suit.`
`However, the black‐suit couldn't {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} that at all...!`
`"*giggle*...!`
` You think {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s could see our forms?`
` Perceive us?`
` Ahhahahahahahaha, you stupid {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s!!`
` Time to pay your foolish compensation for forgetting your awe of magic!!"`
`"H‐hieeiiiiiie!!!`
` What is this?!`
` What's going on?!"`
`".........You cannot {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see}.`
` Because you have no love."`
`"......Impossible!!`
` There are so many {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s here, the anti‐magic toxin is everywhere...... How can you manifest your magic?!`
` What...are you?!?!"`
`"............A witch.`
` And unlike you, a real one."`
`"Khhh... Wrraa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aagghhh, damn youu{-}u{-}u{-}uuu, you biii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iitch!!"`
`As though announcing his candidacy for the fourth victim, one of the black‐suits pointed his gun at Ange.`
`......And pulled the......`
`Ange glared at him coldly, and simply ordered.`
`"F‐fucking diiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeee!!"`
`"Next.`
` Satan."`
`"Satan the Wrathful, already right here!!"`
`"Slowpoke!!`
` You think a simple bullet could hit Ange‐sama or any of us now?!!!"`
`The Stake of Wrath......pierced and smashed the bullet fired by the black‐suit,`
` and continued straight on, towards the man's face—`
`".........Know your foolishness, and regret it in hell!!`
` Die!!"`
`With a terrible explosive sound, the upper half of the man's head was smashed.`
`Bathed in scattered flesh and blood, Ange quietly asked one more time.`
`"...So, Aunt Kasumi.`
` .........Do you still...`
`not feel like believing in magic?"`
`"Th‐`
`this is crazy...`
` ......This can't be real...!!`
` I, I won't accept it...!!`
` There's no way magic is real......!!!"`
`"Yes, that's right...`
` There's no way magic exists...!!`
` There's no way witches exist!!"`
`‘Ma‐......magic exists!!`
` Witches exist......!! Uryuu!!’`
`".........Yes.`
` Magic exists.`
` Witches exist.`
` ......And in this world filled with anger and sadness, you can make them into the key that opens the door to a world of happiness...!!`
` I won't let someone like you......deny that!!"`
`‘Everyone holds the key to a world of happiness in the palm of their hand...!`
` And no one......has any right to steal that away......!!’`
`"You poor {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, who cannot understand this...`
` .........If there had been magic in your life, it would surely have been very different, and much more peaceful."`
`"Not once in your entire life were you ever able to meet with a true witch, and for this,`
` ......I pity you."`
`"Eee......eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekkk!!!"`
`Kasumi let out a piercing scream.`
`At the same time, the two remaining black‐suits came for me at once, and thrusted their guns against my head.`
`......Like they were trying to use me as a hostage against something their eyes couldn't {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see}.`
`.........Against the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, high‐level furniture who had now reached the level of weapons, this was completely and totally pointless.`
`"Dammit, where are you?!`
` You don't stop attacking, and this bitch is dead!!`
` Show yourself!!"`
`"Kyahhahahahahahaha!!!`
` What's this guy on about?! And his guts look so tasty too.`
` .........Ange‐sama, leave the next one to me!"`
`"Go ahead. Kill him."`
`"I am so {i:very} grateful...!!`
` Diiiiiee!!!"`
`The man's chest split, and his guts poured out.`
` ......This terrible way of dying threw the other man into a total panic.`
`However, Asmodeus's form was already at his back,`
` embracing his neck with her arm, ......and smiling obscenely......`
`"What a cute kid.`
` ......Hey, where do you want me to pierce you?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, Ange‐sama, do you have any preference?!!!"`
`"Head."`
`"Certainly, my masteeeer!!`
` Die!!"`
`The final black‐suit had his head smashed by the Stake of Lust,`
` and as his insides scattered, he twisted and fell.`
`In that gruesome world where six people lay in a sea of blood,`
` .........witch and {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} confronted each other.`
`".........Sumadera Kasumi.`
` I sympathize with your pitiable life from the bottom of my heart.`
` ......I can give you magic to seal up that unfillable hole in your heart.`
` If you will believe in that magic, that is."`
`"D‐don't be so......ridiculous......!!`
` This, this is, ...I won't accept it!!`
` Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekk!!"`
`As Kasumi slowly retreated backwards, scared out of her wits,`
` .....she picked up a handgun that someone had dropped.`
`Then, shaking, she pointed it at Ange...`
`"That's right, Kasumi...!`
` Shoot her with that gun...!!`
` Turn your hatred into a bullet and shoot...!!"`
`"Hiee...hiie...!!`
` I'll kill you... I'll kill you...!!`
` If I don't kill you, my life will go unrewarded......!!"`
`"Yes, kill her!`
` Pull the trigger!!`
` Take all of the anger and pain from your shabby life until now!!`
` Use it all against her!"`
`"If you don't, you won't be released from your pain and anguish!!"`
`"............Stop it, Aunt Kasumi.`
` ......You mustn't lend an ear to the black witch."`
`"I'll kill you...... I'll kill you......!`
` Because of your mother,`
` ......my entire life...`
`...has been a wreck......!!"`
`"Then maybe, starting now bit by bit, you can turn that life into something bright and peaceful, with my magic.`
` If you simply believe in magic and have a change of heart,`
` it can open the door to a new world for you."`
`"There's no such thing!!`
` The salvation she speaks of is obviously just some fairy tale!"`
`"Your life is already covered with thorns until you die...!!`
` Let her hear your cries of agony!!`
` You can't regain anything that was lost... Right? Sumadera Kasumiiiiiiiiii?!?!"`
`"Yes, you might not be able to regain anything.`
` But I'm sure you can create something new.`
` So, Aunt Kasumi.`
` Throw that gun away.`
` .........I might be able to teach you of a world of happiness too."`
`"Hiee...`
`......hiie...hieeiii......!!`
` You,`
` .........you don't know......!!`
` Because your mother ran away,`
` .........I was forced to marry her fiancé as a substitute...!!"`
`"You know I had a man who promised to spend his life with me?!`
` You know I was forced to break up with him?!`
` You think you understand how I felt when I was made to wed in your mother's place,`
` ......and was forced to consummate the marriage with a man I had barely even talked to?!?!"`
`"I wanted to kill her!!`
` But Nee‐san just went and died on her own!`
` That's why I'm going to kill you!!`
` Otherwise, my thorn‐covered life will never eeeeeeeend!!"`
`......From Kasumi's eyes,`
` frenzied tears dripped down.`
`This poor woman...`
` ......Even she had such clear and beautiful tears.`
`But for that very reason, ......she hadn't been able to withstand her sad pain,`
` and had had no choice but to listen to the black witch's temptation...`
`"..................I feel so sorry for you.`
` ......In that case, the least I can do is to forever release you and your soul from the bonds of resentment.`
` .........That might be the only bit of charity I can give you now."`
`"Diiiiiiiiiiiee, Ushiromiya Angeeeeeeeeeee!!!"`
`"Goodbye, Aunt Kasumi.`
` .........Take a long rest in a quiet world."`
`I no longer feel any anger or hatred towards you.`
`{n}I just want...`
`to let your soul rest in peace.`
`Kasumi's handgun spat fire.`
`Slowly, that bullet continued through a world frozen to the utmost limit, ......making its way towards {f:5:Ange}'s forehead.`
`"Mammon."`
`"......Y‐......yes!!`
` Mammon the Covetous, right here...!!"`
`"Thanks."`
`"......Huh?"`
`"It was because I met you and Sakutarou that I was able to understand everything."`
`‘......Ange......’`
`"Look away, Sakutarou.`
` .........Mammon.`
` Release that woman.`
` And...protect the honor of Mariage Sorcière...!!"`
`"Ye‐.........yes!!`
` ......Prepare yourself, Sumadera Kasumi!!"`
`Even though the world was frozen, the Stake of Greed flashed like lightning,`
` .........and was already through Kasumi and out the other side...`
`"If you possess the slightest virtue, you shall have an audience again on the mountain of Purgatory!!`
` .........Diiiiiiiieee!!!"`
`The upper half of Sumadera Kasumi's head shattered.`
`......Her cage of flesh was broken,`
` ......and she was finally released......`
`".........And now...it's just you.`
` ...........The black witch.`
` ......At this point, I feel bad for even seeing a resemblance to Aunt Eva in you."`
`"Heh, ......heheheheheh.`
` ...If my form still looks like Ushiromiya Eva,`
` that means you still haven't been able to forgive "me" inside yourself."`
`"I understand, Ange.`
` ............You also want to be released from your thorn‐covered life more than anything."`
`"...................................."`
`"In that case, ......I've thought of something interesting.`
` I'll show you magic as well.`
` .........I won't be the one to kill you."`
`With the worst smile on her face,`
` the black witch changed her form into something like a black mist,`
` ...or else a vast swarm of black flying insects, which began to swirl around me.`
`Then that black mist began to amass bit by bit, ......shaping itself into the form of a human.`
`".....................What's this supposed to be......"`
`Ehheheheheh!`
` I think you know very well what!`
`That woman you hated and despised the most!`
`And that woman hated and despised you the most as well...!`
`When the black mist cleared,`
` .........over there was...`
`.........Aunt Eva's form,`
` ......as she had been while alive.`
`......In her hands...she was holding a gun.`
`"...............Aunt Eva...`
`...died."`
`"*giggle*, long time no see, Angeeee.`
` ......I've returned from hell to kill youu!`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`Aunt Eva glared at me, laughing madly.`
`"But......I'm not that surprised.`
` Aunt Eva was that kind of person."`
`"I imagine my funeral cleared your mood up quite a bit, didn't it?`
` It did for me too, because it meant that I never have to see your face again...!`
` But I did have just one regret.`
` And this is it!!"`
`".........Killing me?`
` ............Was that your last request?"`
`How pitiful.`
` ......Even after death,`
` ......Aunt wasn't released from her suffering......`
`"It was the black witch's power that was the source of my magic.`
` Anger and hatred taught me how to work hard and persist.`
` Completely different from the escapist magic that you speak of!"`
`"......The magic you speak of is nothing more than stress reduction through outbursts of anger.`
` ......Our magic is different.`
` It can remake the entire world.`
` .........It's of a completely different class than your ill‐natured magic."`
`"*snicker*!!`
` In that case, I'll settle it here, once and for all—which comes out on top, black or white...!!`
` By my black magic, I have performed a miracle that has allowed me to revive and point a gun at you like this, even after death.`
` With what kind of miracle will your white magic fight back?"`
`"I have taken you in amongst the anti‐magic toxin.`
` You won't be able to call the Seven Sisters any more.`
` That miracle just now won't occur again...!!"`
`"...............But it will, regardless—that's the reason it's called magic.`
` ......Alright.`
` Mammon. Lend me your power."`
`......But Mammon didn't respond.`
` She didn't appear.`
`Certainly, as she said,`
` the anti‐magic toxin had burned everything up like a wasteland parched by a blazing sun...`
`.........This might be a little tough.`
`"It's useless to call out.`
` Never again...`
`will the Seven Sisters of Purgatory answer you!"`
`"Like I said.`
` I can call them anyway... That's what makes it magic, right?"`
`"........................`
` ......You're a sad child, Ange.`
` So long.`
` The simple days we spent together were reasonably fun.`
` This is goodbye.`
` ......It must be nice for you that this was your final stop."`
`"Yeah, totally.`
` That's very thoughtful of you."`
`"Thanks.`
` Then this is farewell."`
`The barrel of the gun rose slowly,`
` ......so that you could see all the way down it.`
`And,`
` .........the trigger was slowly.........`
`Then,`
` ......there was a loud bang from the gun.`
`...Not in the sense that it fired.`
` ......It {i:exploded}.`
`............You're...kidding me......`
`......In shock, inside frozen space,`
` ......Eva looked at the exploded gun.`
`When time unfroze, the fragments would probably smash into her face all at once...`
`"......Mammon the Covetous.`
` Right here."`
`".....................You're...kidding me..."`
`Behind Eva's back, Mammon stood.`
` .........She had already penetrated the target I had given her.`
` ......Which was...the gun.`
`"Is this......enough magic for you?`
` ............Aunt Eva."`
`"......A‐`
`.........Angeee........."`
`Then, time unfroze.`
`{n}Fragments of the ruptured gun and gunpowder gas burned her face.`
`{n}Letting out a shrill scream, she rolled around covering her face......`
`......It was pitiful.`
`"......Unlucky.`
` ......This is game over.`
` Aunt Eva."`
`I signaled to Mammon.`
` ...To free Eva quickly from her pain as she writhed around with her burnt face.`
`"............Thank you, Mammon.`
` ...I'd like to apologize again, now, from the bottom of my heart, for calling all of you powerless on that day in the classroom.`
` You were excellent furniture for protecting witches."`
`".........It is I who should be grateful.`
` ......I feel truly honored to have been able to meet a good witch and a good master in the end, and to have had the opportunity to fulfill my duty as furniture...!"`
`Mammon understood.`
`{n}This would be the final job I would ever give her.`
`Mammon quietly walked close.`
`{n}Then, she looked down upon her.`
`"......Aunt Eva.`
` Thank you for sticking with me until today.`
` This is farewell.`
` <Have a nice dream>.`
` <See you in hell>."`
`"<Cool>."`
`Then, ......the light sound of her forehead being perforated rang out.`
`......The battle of gunpowder smoke, delirium, ......and white and black magic...was over.`
`It felt like it had been a long, .........truly long journey.`
`{n}And the world slowly...`
`...sank into darkness.........`
`The stars that should be sparkling.........lay not in the sky, but were scattered beneath me.`
`......When I recognized that the pearls and rubies were creating a river of white and red,`
` I realized that it was a vast nighttime scene that was spread out below me...`
`I was in the sky of that nighttime scene, neither standing nor flying,`
` ......but simply floating in the air.`
`......From nowhere in particular, I could hear the sound of one person clapping—`
`a truly dull applause.`
`I understood.`
` ......It was the one who ordered me to go on this journey,`
` ......{f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`"...............Congratulations,`
` Endless Witch, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}.`
` At the end of your travels, you understood everything about magic."`
`"......Yes.`
` .........I now...understand everything about magic.`
` .........I am...a witch.`
` ......The last witch who inherited the magical world created by Mariage Sorcière."`
`".........No one besides you...can tear {f:5:Beatrice}'s world to pieces."`
`"And it was through coming to know magic.........that I learned also how to resist it."`
`"................................."`
`"......Magic is made of love and sadness and anger.`
` ......No matter how cruel a witch {f:5:Beatrice} might have been,`
` the source of her magic is exactly the same."`
`".........And that's why, honestly, I wish I could leave that world of hers alone.`
` ......After all, in her eyes at least, that world is complete as it is."`
`"............But then you'd have to give up on your family."`
`".....................`
` ......That's right.`
` So, although I feel bad about it, I have to fight.`
` .........Because the very reason I left on this journey to become a witch...`
`...was so that I could bet on the small probability that I could take my family back."`
`"Unless you kill {f:5:Beatrice}, only worlds of isolation can exist for you.`
` ......As one who has traveled through billions of fragments, I can guarantee it."`
`"............I understand.`
` ......I don't have room for compassion.`
` ......I must make my heart a demon,`
` .........and tear her heart to pieces."`
`"......It is good that you are steady in your resolve.`
` I was worried that, as another witch like her, you might grow attached and lose your will to continue."`
`Coming from a person like her, whose face was almost always expressionless, those words felt a bit hollow.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` ......The enigmatic witch who invited me on this journey.`
`{n}....................................`
`"There were moments when I suspected that you might have been lying to me."`
`".....................Why?"`
`"......I am the Ange of 1998, so even if I save my family, that will only bring relief to the Ange of 1986.`
` ......It won't do anything for me.`
` So I sometimes felt like I was being deceived."`
`"........................`
` ......That is correct.`
` I deceived you."`
`"......But now I'm grateful.`
` .........After all,`
` in the end, you did teach me the way to take my family back."`
`"............I didn't teach you anything.`
` ......If you have come to know that, it's a state of understanding that you reached on your own as a witch.`
` That place you have reached is different from mine.`
` .........I myself cannot comprehend it, but if it is as you say, then congratulations."`
`"I am not a player in this game, but a piece.`
` You said this to me, right?"`
`"............Yes, I did."`
`"Now, I fully understand that role.`
` ...............A piece doesn't need emotions.`
` It just has to give its all for the sake of victory."`
`"............Yes.`
` That's exactly right.`
` A game is where you each make the best possible move, right?`
` If you allow your moves to get distorted by hesitation and indecision, your opponent will be confused as well."`
`..................Sorry, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`But...don't hold it against me.`
`{n}......“Ushiromiya Ange” still needs her family.`
`So I have the right to fight you...so that I can take them back.`
`And you have the responsibility to accept my challenge.`
`.........So please...don't hold it against me.`
`In exchange...`
`if you do win in this game,`
` I'll give you my blessing as well.`
`Now, let's go.`
` .........As the piece I am, it's finally time for my true turn.`
`Sorry, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
