`"......I don't know why you're angry, Battler."`
`"You {i:should?!}`
` Everyone was killed, goddammit!!`
` By that goddamned old fart!`
` Saying something incomprehensible about {f:5:Beatrice}'s resurrection ritual or something!!"`
`"Then, that means, thirteen people have been offered as sacrifices,`
` ......and {f:5:Beatrice} will have revived already, you know?"`
`"Yeah, that's perfect!!`
` I'll take {f:5:Beatrice} too and kill them both!!"`
`"............We survived the ritual.`
` So we'll receive an invitation to the Golden Land from {f:5:Beatrice}, you see......?"`
`"All wishes are granted there.`
` If you're suffering because your family was killed, then you just have to bring them back to life.`
` ......That's what I plan to do.`
` I'm going to revive my really nice real mama, the one that isn't possessed by the black witch."`
`"......So Mama will always be with me from now on.`
` .........There won't be any more overtime or working on days off.`
` ...She'll always be with me, and think only of me, kihhihihi, and she'll fight all the time against fearsome enemies for me.`
` Kihhihi{0}hi{0}hihihi...!"`
`"......There's something wrong with you.`
` ......How can you sit there saying such incomprehensible crap in a situation like this...?!"`
`"............Didn't Auntie Kyrie just tell you, Battler...?`
` ......Didn't she tell you...`
`to believe...`
`...in the witch?"`
`".....................Sh‐shit.`
` This isn't the time to get in an argument with you...!!`
` Forget "hostages", at this point, there's no one left alive at all!`
` This dumb‐as‐hell, screwed‐up ritual game is done now...!!"`
`"From here on, I'm doing what {i:I} want.`
` Someone might still be alive.`
` Or someone might be hiding!`
` I'll search every nook and cranny of this place, find them, and beat the shit out of them!!"`
`In a rage, Battler grabbed his hat‐stand spear and flew out of the room.`
`Maria watched him go, looking bored...`
`".........But {f:5:Beatrice} would grant your wishes soon anyway.`
` ......Stupid Battler.`
` ......Kihhihihihi."`
`Then, the phone rang out again......`
`Maria stood up, and grabbed the receiver.`
`"Uu.`
` Hello.`
` ......Uu?`
` Uu!!!"`
`Of course, the sound of the phone also reached Battler's ears as he was about to dash out of the guesthouse.`
`With a violent forcefulness, he turned around and dashed into the cousins' room...`
`"M‐Maria......!`
` The phone call, ......who's it from...?!"`
`With a terrifying look on his face, Battler yelled at Maria, who was on the phone.`
`You couldn't blame him......`
` Right now, the only humans left alive on the island were himself, Maria, Gohda, and Kumasawa.`
`But there was no way those two could call when they were locked up in the gardening storehouse.`
`......Which meant.........there was only one person.`
`{n}It had to be Kinzo.`
`As she happily chatted with the person on the other end of the phone, Maria slowly turned to face Battler.`
`.........And, with an unsettling expression on her face, she laughed with a "kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi".`
`{n}......It felt almost as though the person on the other end of the line was chatting about Battler.`
`"Maria...who's on the phone?`
` ......Grandfather......?!"`
`Battler couldn't imagine that this was the case.`
`...After all, it was inconceivable that Maria would be having such a friendly talk with Kinzo,`
` ......chatting to him about Battler with that eerie smile on her face.`
`Just what kind of person could be on the phone.........who could make Maria chat with a smile like that?`
`.........At that time, in the back of his mind, the words Kyrie had spoken to him drifted up.`
`Even if a witch does appear, there is no need to doubt it.`
`{n}......Just.........believe in its existence......`
`"Yep.`
` Battler just came back.`
` He sure is hasty.`
` Kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi......"`
`"Maria!!`
` Who's on the phone?!`
` Who?!?!"`
`"......Hand it over?`
` Sure.`
` ............Here, Battler."`
`After getting the consent of the person on the other end, she held the receiver out to Battler...`
`"..................uh."`
`"Here."`
`Maria held the receiver out for him to take, ......as though it was perfectly normal.`
`Battler felt just a little bit of hesitation towards taking the receiver.`
`......Because, .........by acknowledging the existence of the person at the other end,`
` .........he would have no choice but to admit it.`
`.........Kyrie had said it.`
`......There is no longer...`
`...any need...`
`...to doubt their existence...`
`Battler took the receiver.`
`After he did so, Maria briskly headed for the door.`
`Battler, who was slightly fearful about finding out for sure who was at the other end of the receiver,`
` questioned Maria before taking the call.`
`"H‐hey!`
` Where are you going...?!"`
`"To where my test is.`
` ......I wonder who the Ushiromiya family head will be, you or me.`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi."`
`".........D‐don't go!!`
` You'll be killed!!"`
`"No I won't.`
` The ritual's already over.`
` ...And even if I am, I'll be revived.`
` ......Whether one of us becomes the head or not, we're already invited to the Golden Land.`
` See you."`
`"Wait!!`
` Maria...!!!"`
`Battler stretched his hand out to Maria's back as she left,`
` ......but the cord of the receiver that he was gripping held him back like a chain.`
`......He readied himself.`
` ...Battler put the receiver to his ear......`
`"...............He‐......hello......?"`
`"<Congratulaatioooooooons>!!`
` <And I'm fi~ne>!!`
` <And yoo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oouuuuu>?!`
` Aaa{0}a{0}ah{0}h{0}h{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyaaaaa!!!"`
`Screwed up, mocking English filled his ears.`
`{n}......It was the voice of a woman he didn't know.`
`......Who—`
`the inside of his head was starting to freeze up—`
`............who............`
`"What do you mean "who", Ushiromiya Battleeeeer...?`
` The answer, normally, is <ye~s, I'm fine>!`
` Is it not??`
` That takes me back...you must have done that one in middle school, right?`
` That thing you do in pairs!`
` Uhhya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hyaaaaahh!!!"`
`"Y‐...you're insane......`
` Who are you?!!`
` Answer me!!!"`
`"Say it in Engliiish.`
` Isn't that your specialtyyyyy?"`
`"......Qui‐quit messing with me......`
` Who are you?!!`
` That crazy old bastard's underling?!"`
`"‘Underling’ is a cruel description.`
` Go the other way and try "captive".`
` ......I have Kinzo captive!`
` Ri~~ght?`
` Wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha..."`
`That last laugh didn't sound like it was aimed at Battler.`
`......It was almost as though Kinzo was right next to the phone, cackling as well...`
`"......S‐......say your goddamned name!!`
` Who are you?!`
` Who?!!!"`
`"Try and guess, you could win a invite to Hawaii!`
` Ahhyah{0}hyah{0}hhyaaaah!!`
` Fffinally.`
` FINALLY!!`
` Mmmmmmm, it was soooo looo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ong, the days leading up to today were reee{-}e{-}eeally long...!!"`
`"I seriously waited a thousand years, you know?? For this day to arrive!!`
` And here it is, all thanks to you,`
` my BIG resurrection!!`
` <Thank you>, Kinzo!`
` Just this once,`
` I'll let you have that last takeback of yo~urs!!!"`
`"......Hell's bells, do you have to be in this much of a good mood?`
` Can't you act a little more ladylike?"`
`Kinzo and {f:5:Beatrice} sat facing each other over the chessboard on the reception table.`
`Also on the table were expensive cheeses and the like to go with drinks.`
`{n}And there was a line of several empty wine bottles.`
`As {f:5:Beatrice} rolled around in her sofa in an unseemly way,`
` she held a wine glass in one hand, in a good mood,`
` ......and probably, completely drunk.`
`"I'm in the {i:best} mood today, so I'm feeling crazy generous!!`
` Hey, hey, Kinzo, don't use a well‐aged noble rot wine like this as a decoration!`
` Hooooly shit, it's a 1947?!"`
`"If you don't open it today, just when are you gonna open it?!`
` Let's slosh it all over each other for fun!`
` Then let's whack each other with the empty bottle!`
` Uhhyah{0}hyah{0}hyahhya!!"`
`"Hahhaha, that would be entertaining.`
` You are a little too excited.`
` You're cutting loose too much."`
`"And what about youuuuuu?!`
` Aren't you happy to be reunited with meee?`
` Aaah, it's the living world! The earthly world!!`
` Long live my flesh!!"`
`"......What......are you going on about.........?`
` ...Are you saying that you're......B‐{f:5:Beatrice} or something...?"`
`"<Ye~eeeeeeeeeeeeeeess, I aaaaaaaaaamm>!!`
` Thanks to Kinzo's thirteen‐person murder ritual, I've finally been resurrected...!!`
` It's nice having a mouth, it's nice having a tongue!`
` How fun it is to be able to talk to you like this!"`
`"Come to think of it, even though we've hurled insults at each other over and over again,`
` this is the first time we've had a conversation like this on the board during the game, isn't it?`
` How very fresh!!"`
`"Oh, did you hear that pop sound?!`
` He {i:opened} it, the maniac actually went and opened that vintage wine that's expensive as shit!!`
` Do you know how much a single bottle of that stuff {i:costs}?!`
` As much as a whole ten‐kilogram ingot, isn't that craaaaaazy?!?!`
` Hiiiii‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"`
`"C‐cut the crap...!!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} my ass...!!`
` You say you're the Golden Witch?!`
` That's enough!!"`
`"Where the hell are you?!`
` Is that damn old fart with you as well?!`
` I'll beat the shit out of both of you!!`
` Where are you right now?!`
` Answer me!!"`
`"Ohhh, so you want to meeeet me?`
` Uhhihihihi, sure is tough being a popular woman!`
` But please, don't try to chat me up when Kinzo's around, okaay?`
` The guy's a bad egg, he gets seriously jealous, see?"`
`".........But when Kinzo isn't around and we're all alone, I'll love you all you want in secret, alright...?`
` Uhyaaahya{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}kkya{0}kkya{0}kkyakkya!!!"`
`"Y‐you're insane........."`
`"Kinzoo, I've changed my mind.`
` I won't do Maria's test.`
` You go."`
`"How fickle.`
` Then you are saying that you will do Battler's test?"`
`"Nothing wrong with that, ri~ght?!`
` That guy's so much like a younger you, y'know? It makes my heart race."`
`"Don't worry, I'm not gonna cheat on yooooou.`
` I'll only be alone with him this one time.`
` ......I'm always alone with you, riiight...?`
` But no more tying me up twenty‐four hours a day, alright?`
` Kuhhyahha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!!"`
`"So there you have it, Battlerr!`
` I, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}, will be running your test myself!`
` As for the place...let me see.`
` At the front entrance to this mansion!"`
`"Battlerr, this headship test, you've seriously gotta full‐ass this one, okaay?`
` ......I mean, Kinzo's practically dead on his feet.`
` If you become the next head, you'll be the new owner of everything on this island."`
`"......I wouldn't mind letting you have me all to yourself, you know......?`
` Just like Kinzo did, ......control me, okay......?`
` Kuhhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi, uhhya{0}hha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!"`
`"Th‐the front entrance of the mansion......`
` Perfect...!!`
` Listen to me, you stinking drunk!!`
` I'll sober you up.`
` And I've got some {i:hot punch} waiting to help you through your hangover!!`
` Just you wait!!"`
`Battler impulsively slammed the receiver down.`
`{n}There was no need to talk through a receiver anymore.`
`......I'll meet her face to face and settle this!!`
`I took the spear I'd made by taking apart the hat stand,`
` and went outside without even an umbrella.`
`......It's hard to imagine that the young woman calling herself {f:5:Beatrice} will be waiting for me alone.`
`...I should probably assume that she'll be waiting with those supporting troops that Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san told us about.`
`Going alone would be too reckless...`
`"Gohda‐san, Kumasawa‐san...!`
` It's me, it's Battler...!"`
`I headed for the gardening storehouse first.`
`{n}I need all the help I can get.`
`Gohda‐san's a burly man, so I can probably count on him to add some extra brawn.`
`{n}Kumasawa‐san's knowledge and familiarity with the area as a senior servant might prove to be a huge weapon.`
`Both of them have master keys, and they know more about the mansion than I do.`
` ......They're pretty reliable allies.`
`As I banged on the shutter and called out for them to open it, I remembered that there was nothing they could do from the inside.`
`I would have to get the key back from them and open the shutter myself.`
`I went around to the side, knocked on the small latticed window there, and opened it up.`
`"Gohda‐san, Kumasawa baa‐chan...!`
` It's Battler...!!`
` Hey, come on, get up...............h...ey........."`
`The scene in the shed, lit by a dim lightbulb, .........was all too......bizarre......`
`"......Gohda...`
`sa...n......`
` ......Kumasawa......sa...`
`......n........."`
`From a low ceiling beam...`
`......hung two thick ropes,`
` ......and at the ends,`
` ......Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san...`
`.........were hanging...by their necks.....`
`It was dim, and I was looking through a narrow gap between all the various pieces of equipment strewn about, so I couldn't make out any more detail than that.`
`......But when they showed not even a tremor after I called out to them,`
` and because of the way the loops around their necks seemed to carry the full weight of their bodies, I could sense no trace of life from them......`
`"You've got to be............kidding me......right............?`
` ......Why........."`
`The shutter is still closed.`
`......And there's only a single key, which I'm sure Gohda‐san took possession of.`
`So how did the culprit......open the shutter and kill the two of them inside......?`
`No wait, they weren't necessarily killed...`
`{n}If this is a suicide......`
`......That way, this locked room makes sense, but I don't know why the two of them would hang themselves...!!`
`Feebly, ...I slumped down on the spot.`
`Now, the only humans alive on this island...`
`...are me, Maria,`
` ......and my old bastard's old bastard.`
`.........No, there's also that nutso woman calling herself {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`Maria's been acting like she's on the witch's side from the beginning.`
`{n}And Gramps is the very person who revived the witch.`
`{n}Plus there's the witch herself.`
`......What the hell... .........Then, it's just as though...`
`.........I'm the only one on this island............`
`Using my pole as a cane, I feebly rose to my feet.`
`......Damn, I can't do it like this...`
`{n}I've got to avenge...everyone......`
`"Damn iiiiiiiit...... This is no good...`
` Yeah, it's no good, it's no goddamn good at all...`
` Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiitt........."`
`I got the crying out of the way while I could...`
` So that all my weak emotions would be squeezed out with my tears...`
`Then, ......I straightened up, and gazed into the darkness in the direction of the mansion.`
`.........At the entrance to the mansion, the witch is waiting.`
`I'll go, ......and settle this.`
`I'll find the source of this weird, blood‐soaked night, ......and crush her with my own hands...!`
`Amidst the pouring rain, ......I walked through the rose garden without an umbrella, letting myself get soaked.`
`......I could see the arbor in the distance.`
`According to Jessica, it seemed that George‐aniki had also been killed...`
`Well, by this point, there's no need to worry about the lives of any hostages.`
`{n}......I left the path, aiming for the arbor.`
`Then,`
` ............I saw George‐aniki's weather‐beaten corpse...`
`"...............Aniki......`
` ............Shit............"`
`The corpse was in front of the arbor.`
`If he could have died under the arbor, he would at least have been spared being beaten down upon by the rain...`
`There was a gaping hole in Aniki's forehead, as though he had been shot with a gun.`
`Perhaps because the rain had washed everything away, his face wasn't covered with blood, ......and so he looked almost like he was sleeping.`
`...However, the deep red his clothes were stained still provided the evidence that a large amount of blood had flowed out...`
`How happy I'd be if he were sleeping, or else pretending to be dead...`
`......But Aniki's eyes remained open, even though the rain sprayed against them.`
`......And......the hole in his forehead was, without a hint of a joke,`
` ......the real thing...`
`There had been a faint chance...`
`that Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san hanging by their necks in the gardening shed could have been a bad joke.`
`But that naive possibility had now been completely denied.`
`And, as I looked at this corpse, I became completely sure.`
`Just as Gohda‐san had once said.`
` ......The enemy came to take lives as though these lives were pieces on a chess board.`
`".........Yeah, ......there's no mistake.`
` ......It seems that old geezer and the witch...`
`......really don't view our lives as anything more than that......"`
`...That damn witch, when she was on the phone...`
`{n}She talked about us like we were "on the game board"......`
`"...Perfect......`
` ......Right, she thinks this is a game, huh......`
` Then, ...in the same way you killed everyone like it was a game,`
` .........it's alright if I kill all of you like it's a game as well, right......?"`
`"............Just you wait......`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice}........."`
`The lightning caused the mansion's vast shadow to emerge.`
`......Finally, ......the mansion.`
`As the massive shape came into view, there was no silhouette of any person.`
`{n}It seemed that there weren't any underlings waiting for me in a pack, or anything like that.`
`.........According to Kyrie‐san, there were a large number of attendants with goat heads.`
`At least for now, I couldn't sense...`
`any large group like that hiding and staring at me...`
`What's this......?`
`{n}Beneath the roof of the entrance,`
` .........there's something set down.`
`"......What is this?`
` .........A...box?"`
`It looked like the kind of small box that girls often keep trinkets in.`
`......Or maybe it was the same kind of extravagant cigar case you'd find in a reception room.`
`Either way, it didn't look like something that belonged here...`
`{n}It clearly looked......as though I was being told to open it.`
`But the thought of doing what they wanted me to do was somehow irritating.`
`{n}......However, it didn't look like we'd get anywhere if I didn't open it.`
`Could it be that it's set up with some trap to make it explode when opened......?`
`While thinking things like that, and forgetting even to go under the overhang,`
` I continued to glare at the box as the rain beat down upon me.`
`Then, .........mixed in with the thunder, was some kind of......music?`
` ...It sounded like something like that.`
`......It was the tone of the big clock in the hall announcing midnight.`
`It was also the sound that announced that the crazy day of October 4th had finally ended,`
` ......and that the much more incredibly crazy day of October 5th had begun.`
`That sound quietened, ............and I could hear an eerie laugh coming out of nowhere......`
`I got the feeling that the voice was coming from the heavens, ......and I looked up at the sky.`
`......And there.........was a woman I had never seen before.`
`{n}No, it's not true that I've never seen her before.`
`{n}......I saw her once today.`
`Yes, in the portrait inside the mansion......`
`The clothes were different, ......but that face was just like the witch of the portrait......`
`Aaah, who am I kidding... I already know who this person is...!!`
`"......S‐......so you are {f:5:Beatrice}!!!"`
`"Yooohooooooooo, Battleeeeeeeeeeeeer...!!"`
`Leaning over the second floor balcony, ......and waving cheerily from under her umbrella,`
` ......was, without a doubt, ......the witch of the portrait, ...{f:5:Beatrice}.........!!`
`Was the plan for the boss to watch on from above as her goat underlings torture me to death...?!`
`I adjusted my grip on the spear,`
` and, imagining goats creeping out of the surrounding shadows and the entrance and surrounding me, I raised my guard in all directions...`
`"Ahhaha, be at ease, there's no one here but you and me, see?`
` There is no goat furniture, there are no demon butlers; Master is not here, nor my close demon friend."`
`"And there are none of the gold butterflies that help compose my physical form, there are no magic circles, and no summoners in attendance!!`
` ......Do you know what this means?"`
`"Not a clue.`
` Quit babbling..."`
`"I have in fact met you several times even in this world.`
` Almost as though brushing past one another, meeting only for a moment.`
` ......As you know, this world of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s is filled with a toxin just by your existence and your doubting of me."`
`"Almost like solid ramparts strengthening the defense around you, the king!`
` And through multiple games,`
` I advanced my pieces one by one, splitting you apart, and cornering you, undermining your ramparts bit by bit."`
`"Then, finally, once I opened a tiny crack, I sent a bishop in, so that it could approach right up next to you.`
` .........But as you know, bishops are pieces with blind spots."`
`"As long as you stay on the black squares, a black bishop can exert massive influence upon you,`
` but if you escape just one step to a white square, then even if I close in right next to you, I will not be able to touch you."`
`"That is why I have progressed through these games by sending in various pieces so that you cannot stay on a white square,`
` forcing you out in front of me, the one who controls the black squares next to you."`
`"Howeeever!!"`
`"There are now holes opened all over your ramparts,`
` and I was at last able to send in, not a bishop, but a full queen!!`
` Do you know what kind of piece a queen is?"`
`"A rook plus a bishop.`
` ......Is this what you're trying to say?`
` ...Now, you not only control the black squares that are the witch illusions, but have also become able to encroach upon the white squares of the human world at will...?!"`
`"That is correct!!`
` Where there exist the gold butterflies that are my minions, you have been labeling those squares as witch illusions,`
` denying them under the hypothesis that they are observerless nonreality, am I right...?`
` *cackle*cackle*, I am well aware......!!"`
`"For that very reason, I have at last descended thus upon the squares of white!!`
` Worry not, I'll call plenty of gold butterflies, goats, demons, and witches later on!`
` If you wish, I will invite you to my Golden Land!!"`
`"There, I will grant you any wish that you desire...!!`
` Wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!"`
`"......It's starting to look like someone knocked an ink bottle over the chessboard of this island."`
`"I see, that too is a pleasant description...!`
` *cackle*cackle*, soon, you will be covered in that ink as well.`
` Before long, you will become dyed pitch‐black, and surely become a black king...!`
` At this point, you are a pitiful existence drowning in a sea of ink, are you not?"`
`"No, I'm not.`
` I'll admit that the island has been stained completely black from your ink bottle,`
` ......but there's still a white square left."`
`"Hoh, and where...?!!"`
`"Right under my feet.`
` .........Your magic ink may try to cover the entire island, but it can't cover the ground my feet are standing on.`
` ...Even if this island seems to be stained pitch‐black at a glance, I am me.`
` I am here, with my feet firmly planted on a white square!!"`
`It's strange...`
` Until a second ago, I was trembling all over.`
`......But now that she's appeared openly right before my eyes like this, my terror has actually lessened.`
`It's funny.`
` Ghosts are most terrifying when you can only sense them.`
`When you can see them, and they have a face you can plant your fist into, there's nothing scary about it...!!`
`......However, she is definitely not a funny or a friendly person.`
`......She can kill me instantly while rolling around giggling, just by snapping a finger.`
`Whether we interpret the result of her snapping her fingers as magic flying at me or underlings showing up to shoot me, it doesn't matter.`
`......In any case, whether this is fantasy or mystery,`
` that queen is in a position where she can kill me just by snapping her fingers......!`
`...I see, ......so this is the meaning...`
`......of the queen of this island,`
` ...who reigns over both the white and black squares......?!`
`"Now then.`
` It might be interesting to wait until you catch a cold in all that rain, but it's about time to move to the matter at hand.`
` .........I am sure that you can tell there is a box there?`
` Your test is inside of it."`
`"Hold it.`
` ......After all that's happened, I'm not interested in some stupid game about who'll be the next head."`
`"My game is to take you and the old man, ......and all the rest of you guys who killed everyone, and give every one of you a full‐on punch to the face."`
`"Hoh.`
` So you will fly through the sky up to my balcony?`
` Very good, very good, *cackle*!`
` Come on then, up you come already, come on come on, up up!"`
`"......Damn you, acting like you're hot shit just 'cause you're in a completely safe place...`
` I'm coming up there right now, so you better be prepared!!"`
`"Aah, no, no, no.`
` It's all locked up.`
` Of course, the shutters are down for all the windows as well.`
` My castle isn't so fragile that a single knight like you could break in!"`
`I tried the front door anyway just in case, ......but, yup, it really was locked.`
`{n}When I looked around, I noticed that indeed the shutters were closed on the windows.`
`......Normally, they wouldn't be.`
`"......Tch.`
` Looks like you prepare for everything.`
` ......Where's the key?!"`
`Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san probably have master keys, but they're in the locked room of the gardening storehouse.`
`......I can only give up for now...!`
`"Damn......`
` ......Guess she's no fool herself."`
`"Are you really so dying to be right by my siiiide?`
` Alright, if you pass your test with flying colors, why don't I grant you an audience?`
` If you pass, then you will be the successor, and my new master after Kinzo."`
`"......My body and soul will be yours to do with as you will.`
` Because I am ultimately the Ushiromiya family's furniture!`
` Ah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"`
`"............Well,`
` it looks like you want to make me take this test no matter what.`
` ......Alright.`
` I'm game.`
` ...If I pass, my first prize will be a punch to your face."`
`"Scary, scaary...`
` But it's not like I mind being controlled by violence, you see?`
` {i:Grab}...onto my head!`
` Make my face twist in pain, violate me in the same way a hawk tears apart and scratches at its prey with its talons...!!"`
`"Aaah, remind me of Kinzo in his younger days once more...!!`
` That single time in my thousand‐year life!`
` Remind me of that day I was taught the joy of being controlled, of submitting and being reduced to furnituuuuuuuure!!`
` Uhyaaa{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}hhya!!"`
`"......You damn drunk, we aren't getting anywhere."`
`Ignoring the stupidly smiling witch, I picked up the box.`
`"Yes.`
` Open it.`
` Inside is a letter.`
` Read it."`
`"........................"`
`I opened it.`
` ......There was a faint smell of cigarettes.`
`{n}Apparently, it really had originally been a cigar case.`
`{n}But there were no cigarettes or cigars inside.`
`Instead, there was a Western envelope with the One‐winged Eagle crest.`
`{n}And when I opened that too, ......there was a letter inside.`
`I looked up at the witch.`
` She was grinning down at me.`
`......It seemed she was waiting in anticipation to see what kind of reaction I'd have to the contents.`
`......Dammit, I'll show her.`
` Its contents were like this...`
`{a:c:{e:070:Among the three mentioned below.`
`{n}In order to gain two, sacrifice one.`
`{n}{n}1. Your life`
`{n}2. __'s life`
`{n}3. Everyone else's lives`
`{n}{n}If you do not choose one, all of the above will be lost.}}`
`".........The heck is this?`
` Some pretty creepy stuff's written here.`
` And most importantly, the second one is blank, so I don't even know whose life."`
`"Mm.`
` That second one is where you put the name of the one that person loves the most.`
` For Jessica's test, it was Kanon's name, and for George's test it was Shannon's name."`
`"......Since they had obvious feelings for certain people, I was able to write those names in beforehand,`
` but I don't know who you have feelings for.`
` So I didn't know whose name to write, and left it blank."`
`"That's perfect.`
` I love you, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I'll stick your name in here.`
` So my choice is going to be number two.`
` Is that alright?"`
`"Hey, hey, quit joking, quit joking.`
` Come onnn, please, Battler.`
` Tell me the name of the person you have feelings for.`
` If you don't, then this won't be a test, right?"`
`"Too bad.`
` I don't have any woman in particular.`
` Even if I did, why the hell would I tell you?"`
`"In that case, this test will not work for you.`
` Hmmm, what a shame, what a shame.`
` And I was really wondering what kind of woman was your cup of tea!`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`".........What if I said I like young, flat‐chested girls with long, black hair.`
` You don't match in a single area, do you?"`
`"Lies, you breast sommelier!`
` You prefer a blonde bombshell with a <dynamite body>, don't you?!`
` I am precisely the embodiment of your ideal, *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"If guessing your three sizes is the test to become the successor, I'll take it gladly."`
`"Ah, yes.`
` This was the test to choose the successor.`
` Chatting with you is so much fun that I've been getting a bit off topic."`
`"......Then let us begin the headship test.`
` I will question you to see whether you are qualified to be the next Ushiromiya family head.`
` Answer with care."`
`The witch, who had been joking around like she was drunk until a second ago, suddenly regained her gravitas.`
`......She looked as though she truly had stepped out of that imposing portrait...`
`".........I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, the Golden Witch and the Endless Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......Do you have the qualifications to inherit the Ushiromiya family headship and all of my gold—`
`that is what I will test.`
` .........State your name."`
`"............Ushiromiya...Battler."`
`Under that majestic gaze, unimaginable from her manner a short while ago,`
` I answered without any hesitation.`
`......She truly was......yes, indeed,`
` ......in the truest sense, she was that worthy of calling herself the queen of this island.`
`"Very good, Ushiromiya Battler.`
` .........However, you have thrown away that Ushiromiya name for the past six years, have you not...?`
` Why is that...?"`
`".........mgh............`
` ......Because I'd had enough of my dad, the old bastard."`
`"I know.`
` It was because you felt your father's remarriage disgraced the death of your mother, whom you loved and respected, yes...?"`
`"I see, you have no blood relation to your new mother whatsoever.`
` It is not as though I cannot understand why you would feel unable to accept that mother.`
` ......However, no matter who your father remarries with, that does not change the fact that his blood runs in your veins, correct?"`
`".........What's your point?"`
`"I can, to an extent, understand the childishness which led you to oppose your father's remarriage out of a desire to have him all to yourself."`
`"However, was throwing away the Ushiromiya name as a means of resistance not a disgrace to your family and blood?"`
`".........You were born and raised Ushiromiya, were you not?`
` Do you think you were qualified to forget that debt and throw away the Ushiromiya name?"`
`"......It has nothing to do with you.`
` This is between me and Dad...!"`
`"The Ushiromiya name does not belong to you and your father alone.`
` You are a child who simply rebelled, unable to forgive the fact that your father was to be stolen away by an unknown woman.`
` ......Those six years during which you forsook the Ushiromiya register were a significantly long period where you dragged the Ushiromiya name through the mud.`
` Know the depths of your sinfulness."`
`"..................Well, sorry I'm so childish..."`
`"However.`
` Even though it was prompted by the deaths of your grandparents, I do commend you for returning to the Ushiromiya register.`
` Accordingly, I shall give you a chance to purify yourself of that sin.`
` Now is the time to atone for your sin of six years ago."`
`"Come, try to remember, remember your own sin.`
` Remember it, confess, and repent.`
` ............That shall be my test for you."`
`......At that moment, a massive thunderclap rang out, making my mind go blank.`
`"..............................`
` ......Repent? ...What?`
` .........Are you trying to tell me to apologize?"`
`".........The test has already begun.`
` You may think as you wish."`
`There were no signs from the witch's expression that she was sneering at a person unable to answer the tough question thrust upon them.`
`{n}......She was earnestly asking something of him, and he could even feel a quiet determination.`
`Even as the rain beat upon him, Battler could not shift his eyes from her gaze.`
`......The witch threw her umbrella away.`
`{n}She abandoned herself to the falling rain.`
`So that the rain would fall on her until Battler answered that question.`
`......She had chosen to join him, allowing the rain to beat down on her as well, until he reached an answer.`
`For some reason, Battler could tell that.`
`{n}......But, even so, ......he didn't understand.`
`"W‐......well, ...uh.`
` ......I mean, you're right, I do think I was being childish...`
` All things considered, just 'cause Dad got remarried, that doesn't wipe out what I owe him for raising me."`
`"......I hear Dad always kept on sending money over for my living expenses,`
` ......and he even said he wanted to be involved in my school events.`
` .........The only reason he couldn't come is......I told Grandma and Grandpa not to let him come no matter what......"`
`"......................................."`
`"......A‐and yeah, ......if you want to just be blunt and say I was being childish and rebellious, I can't argue with that.`
` .........But you know, ...in that case,`
` ......Mom, ......Ushiromiya Asumu, who's gonna set things right for her...?!`
` Mom was so devoted to our family, and did the very best she could...!"`
`"But Dad was cheating with Kyrie‐san.`
` He even got her pregnant with Ange...!`
` And then the moment she was born, he rushed them both into his register."`
`"......What is that if not a betrayal of Mom?!`
` Who's gonna set things...`
`right...`
`for her?!!"`
`"......But what you're saying is also right.`
` Even though the cheating was a fact, I still owed him for raising me."`
`"So I thought I'd cancel those two things out and leave the family, what's the problem with that?!!`
` That's right, I had the right, ......no, the duty to wallop Dad in Mom's place, didn't I?!"`
`"I let him get away without that!`
` I left without saying anything, as though I hadn't been there in the first place!!`
` And Dad forgot about me and started a new family with Kyrie‐san and Ange!`
` That settles everything, doesn't it?!!"`
`But six years passed after that.`
` ......Time healed the anger.`
`Kyrie‐san understood my anger as well,`
` and she tried hard to interact with me despite that, and soften my heart.`
`Ange didn't know anything about the situation,`
` and she adored me, believing that I was her real big brother who just lived in a separate house.`
`......As for Dad, he was acting like nothing had happened, and told me I could come home any time I wanted.`
`"It started to feel more and more stupid keeping it all going!!`
` I thought it was about time for me to cool my head as well.`
` So I said to Dad that if he apologized, I'd call it water under the bridge.`
` On the day of Grandpa's funeral."`
`"And that guy, he actually put both his hands on the floor and apologized...!!`
` I couldn't believe how pathetic he looked...!"`
`"My dad, who was all about looking cool, actually bowed his goddamn head to me...!`
` ......When I saw that, it felt like it'd be stupid to keep it up any longer."`
`"I'm sure Mom would've thought the same thing!`
` Every time Dad and I fought, Mom would always laugh and mediate for us.`
` "Oh, that silly thing is what you were fighting over?"`
` she'd say.`
` ......I could feel Mom saying that and laughing...!!"`
`"That's why,`
` ......while I couldn't bring myself to say "I forgive you",`
` .........I thought it might be alright to start over again from zero.`
` So I decided to wind everything back to how it was six years ago.`
` .........And I returned to the Ushiromiya family register...!!`
` I'd cried, raged, and stressed over it for a whole six years!"`
`"It might have been the same for Dad, and maybe even for my dead mom.`
` Maybe Kyrie‐san and Ange too.`
` ......So we went back to zero, and I returned to being Ushiromiya Battler!!!`
` That's my immediate family's problem,`
` ......and has nothing the hell to do with the Ushiromiya family!!"`
`"You aren't qualified to judge that to be a sin, and I have no duty to show repentance to you!`
` If there was anyone I should have done that for, you've already killed them!!"`
`"So I won't apologize for anything!`
` I won't repent!!!`
` That is my answer for this test!!!"`
`"..........................................`
` ......Is that all...?"`
`"What.........?`
` .................."`
`I had pretty much fully responded to her provocation,`
` and I was sure that I'd vented out all the stuff that I'd been keeping inside my chest, stuff I hadn't wanted to show anyone.`
`That was what the witch had supposedly been hoping for, too.`
` ......And yet, the witch's blank expression didn't change in the slightest.`
`I had been sure she would start cackling and guffawing,`
` sneering at my childish, foolish, and shameful past.`
`But to the contrary, I could feel a sense of shock about her,`
` ......something you could almost call disappointment.`
`".........What do you mean "is that all", ......I've confessed everything inside me!`
` What aren't you happy about?"`
`"The atonement for your sins is still insufficient."`
`"Atonement?`
` ......What the hell, are you asking me to prostrate myself right here and apologize like Dad did...?!"`
`"............No.`
` I have no interest in the home affairs of your immediate family.`
` Where are we?`
` Rokkenjima.`
` The main residence of the Ushiromiya head family.`
` ......Isn't there a sin you should remember, fitting for this place......?"`
`"............Are you......saying that I have...another sin......?"`
`"......Remember, Ushiromiya Battler.`
` .........And it is your inability to remember which is your sin.`
` For that reason, I shall forgive you.`
` If you can remember, I shall forgive you.`
` .........Remembering that is my test of atonement for you."`
`".........That's......a lot easier said than done......"`
`"............Remember.`
` ......That is why it is a sin."`
`"...Sorry, Beato.`
` ......I have absolutely no memory of it."`
`"......You make it seem like I caused you trouble six years ago or something,`
` but unless I'm mistaken, this family conference is the first time we met.`
` It's true that your legend did exist six years ago,`
` but I'm pretty confident that we didn't know each other back then."`
`"......Naturally.`
` On the Rokkenjima of six years ago, I was not yet manifested."`
`"Then what kind of sin are you saying I have?`
` ......Are you saying......I've sinned against you somehow...?"`
`"Do not make me repeat myself.`
` I was not manifested six years ago.`
` For us to have been acquainted would be an impossibility.`
` In the world you represent, it was as though I did not even exist."`
`......Beato's cold eyes......felt as though they were accusing me of some kind of sin.`
`It felt, on the face of it, as though she was still holding a grudge for some way I'd treated her, and was criticizing me for it.`
`However, ......I obviously couldn't remember doing anything like that to her, and Beato had said so herself.`
`There was no link between us six years ago.`
`{p:1:Six years ago, no person called {f:5:Beatrice} existed for me}.`
`".........At least give me a hint.`
` ......Does this sin or whatever...have something to do with...`
`...you and me......?"`
`"I had no connection to you six years ago.`
` Remove me from your thoughts already.`
` ......Why...do you think it is a sin against {i:me}?"`
`".........Your......eyes."`
`"Eyes...?`
` ............Hoh."`
`"Your eyes, they're......whispering at me to apologize.`
` ......But I had no connection with you six years ago, and even you admitted that."`
`"............Is it true?`
` ......Is it really not a problem between me and you......?"`
`".........I already said it wasn't.`
` No problem between me and you has anything to do with this."`
`"But still, ......your eyes are telling me differently.`
` ............So I don't even have a clue.`
` .........Can you say it in red?`
` Can you declare that the sin you're telling me to remember isn't something between you and me?"`
`"...........................`
` ......Very well."`
`{p:1:The sin I am now demanding that you remember is not between Ushiromiya Battler and {f:5:Beatrice}}.`
`".........Then why are you looking at me with those eyes......?"`
`"I do not know.`
` .........I am simply gazing at you blankly.`
` If it feels that way to you,`
` ......perhaps that is because there is something that makes you feel that way."`
`"........................`
` .........What the hell kind of sin have I got?"`
`"{p:1:Ushiromiya Battler has a sin}."`
`"......I said what kind, dammit.`
` It's probably just some stupid sin, like hitting someone or tricking someone."`
`"{p:1:Because of your sin, people die}."`
`"L‐liar...!`
` I've never killed anyone...!!`
` Say it, then!`
` Who did I kill?!`
` When? Who? How?!"`
`"{p:1:Due to your sin, a great many humans on this island die}.`
` {p:1:None will escape, all will die}."`
`"Wh‐.........whaaaaat?!?!`
` Wh‐what the hell are you going on about?!`
` Are you saying {i:I} killed everyone?!`
` I'm a killer?!"`
`"You do not carry it out directly.`
` .........However, because you committed a sin, the cogs of fate were sent astray, spun a full six years, and due to the deviation that resulted,`
` ......tonight, this many lives are lost."`
`"{i:You are one of the causes of this tragedy}."`
`"......Oh, ......come the fuck on!!`
` {i:I'm} the cause?!`
` Then what?!`
` Are you saying thirteen people died because {i:I} abandoned the Ushiromiya register six years ago?!`
` Are you saying thirteen people died because {i:I} came back to the Ushiromiya family after six years?!"`
`"Give me a fucking break!!!`
` For these six years, I've been the man furthest from the Ushiromiya family!`
` What influence could {i:I} have had on {i:anything} and how?!"`
`"It's not like I came to the family conference because I wanted to!`
` I'd patched things up with the family after six years, so to like, draw a line under that whole period,`
` I came to Rokkenjima reluctantly...!!`
` It's not like I had some duty to come here today!"`
`"I came back, and because of that a tragedy occurred?`
` Then what?!`
` You're saying that if I hadn't come back, no one would've had to die?!"`
`"Say it in red!!`
` Can you say in red that if I hadn't come back, this screwed‐up murder case wouldn't have occurred?!`
` ......There's no way you can, because you're the culprit behind everything!!"`
`"Repetition requested!!`
` "If Ushiromiya Battler hadn't returned to Rokkenjima, the crime wouldn't have occurred".`
` Go on, say it if you think you can...!!"`
`"......Can't do it, can you?`
` There's no way in hell you can, the culprit is you, not me!!`
` Don't you dare try to push the blame for this onto meeeeeeee!!!"`
`"......................................."`
`"......Answer, in red!!`
` I said repeat it...!!`
` You can't!`
` My existence has nothing to do with the crime.`
` Stop messing with my heeeaaaad!!!"`
`I began to remember that the raindrops pounding down were cold.`
`......The rain earlier had just hurt,`
` ......but now I felt a tormenting cold from those raindrops......`
`".................................`
` ......Is there nothing that you remember?"`
`".........Sorry,`
` but I don't have a goddamn clue."`
`".............................."`
`"......Look.`
` ......I'm starting to get a little pissed off.`
` ......If there's something you wanna say, then say it.`
` If you have a grudge against me, you just have to come out and say it.`
` ......Don't be nasty about it and demand for me to remember."`
`"............I'll ask one more time.`
` ......Can you not remember any sin?"`
`"No!!`
` I can't remember a goddamn thing...!!"`
`".........So...`
`...he says that he can remember...nothing."`
`With this, are your regrets at an end......?`
`"...........................`
` ...............m...m..."`
`Even a hopelessly long shot will be a source of regret if not attempted.`
`......That will do.`
`The attempt itself has meaning.`
`".........That may be true.`
` ...In that case, this is...`
`the end of my regrets, and my game."`
`What will you do...?`
`"...Who knows.`
` .........I'm not interested at all anymore.`
` ......Sorry, but I wish to leave the game board now."`
`..............................`
` ......I see.`
` ......I understand.`
`"I will take over for the rest of the game.`
` .........You may rest."`
`"......Mm.`
` ..............."`
`"All that remains, I will finish.`
` .........You may forget everything and bury your head in your pillow.`
` A feather futon should gently protect you from everything."`
`".........Finish up the rest for me, ......please."`
`"Leave it to me.`
` ......Leave everything else to me, and sleep."`
`The witch who had questioned Battler hid herself,`
` and the other witch, who had appeared from behind, remained.`
`She was certainly identical, the same witch,`
` .........but her expression was somehow indifferent and ice‐cold,`
` ......a far cry from the one before, who, though apparently drunk, had at least been in high spirits.`
`"...............Hey!!`
` Are you listening?!`
` That's enough for that test thing, right?!`
` I don't give a crap whether I passed or failed!`
` The only thing that's gonna help the way I'm feeling is bashing you in the face!!`
` Get the hell down here!!`
` Or else open up this door...!!"`
`The witch said nothing back.`
`Her eyes were as ice‐cold as Battler's shoulders.`
`......She was clearly a different person from the one who had first appeared on that balcony.`
`The witch looked hard into my eyes, ......and gave two small shakes of the head.`
`Even without words, I was able to gather that she was expressing some kind of disappointment...`
`Without saying anything, the witch turned on her heels.`
`After that, only Battler remained, the cold rain still beating down on him.........`
`The study was in the middle of a lively party.`
`It seemed that Gaap was making fun of {f:5:Virgilia}, teasing her over some stupid triviality.`
`...They were spitting "Lialialia", "Gapgapgap" at each other.`
`Kinzo and Ronove had opened a new bottle and were enjoying the show.`
`"Oh, you're back.`
` How were the results of Battler's test?!"`
`"Maria's test got passing marks with no complaints, I'll have you know?`
` I've long held her in contempt as a worthless little urchin,`
` but lo and behold, surprise surprise, {nobr:my oh} {nobr:my oh} {nobr:my oh} my, not bad, not bad, not bad indeed!`
` Wa‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"`
`It seemed like Kinzo was dead drunk.`
`{n}He laughed towards Beato with the same level of excitation as the time they'd left for the tests.`
`...However, Ronove and {f:5:Virgilia} instantly noticed the change in her enthusiasm.`
`Gaap also froze her expression and went silent.`
`"Wahhahahahahahhahha, what is it, {f:5:Beatrice}, my beloved witch?`
` Not enough to drink? Not enough on the side?`
` Let's go out in the pouring rain and roast a cow whole, oohhh, not a bad idea!"`
`"Ronove, make the preparations right away!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}, let's leave the results of Battler's test for later.`
` Why don't we have a toast with spare ribs first, uwa‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"`
`"..................Roast yourself whole."`
`"‐ha‐hah‐hah‐hah,`
` ......what?"`
`As Kinzo doubled over laughing in a great mood, the witch who had spoken bluntly passed him coldly by.`
`......Then, behind the witch's back,`
` .........the old summoner's body suddenly went up in flames...`
`"Gyuoaaaaooaahhh!!!!`
` Gwohh, gah, ......gyah.........w...h...y............?!"`
`While spitting crimson flames from his eyes, mouth, nose...every hole on his body, Kinzo rolled around.`
`......Even though it was a terrible hellfire, it didn't burn anything except Kinzo.`
`Kinzo didn't have a clue what was going on.`
`......He rolled around, unable to understand why {f:5:Beatrice}, who had been in such a good mood,`
` had suddenly turned so cold......`
`The dancing silhouettes of witches and demons created by that massive rolling torch...`
`looked like a group of excited spectators around a burning at the stake.`
`However, the eyes of the demons watching over it were indifferent......`
`When Kinzo finally stopped moving, the fire disappeared, leaving a pitch‐black corpse.`
`The inside of the room was commanded by the stillness of the sound of the rain......`
`"......What has happened, Milady?"`
`"It has lost its thrill.`
` .........Clean up those bothersome cinders."`
`{f:5:Beatrice}'s expression......was unbelievably apathetic.`
`...There was an iciness there that told the others that they risked the same fate as Kinzo if they annoyed her.`
`"............Y‐yes.`
` I will do it..."`
`Gaap made a jet‐black pitfall swallow up Kinzo's cinders.`
`...If she hadn't carried that out quickly, Gaap might also have been burned.`
` You could feel that thirst for blood.`
`No, a thirst for blood probably isn't the best way to describe it.`
`......Just like humans don't have any particular emotion when they step on an ant while walking.`
`......That was how much, unconsciously and mercilessly, Beato was now filled with a brutal emptiness that wouldn't hesitate to bury a passerby...`
`"......Wh‐what is it, Beato?"`
`"I don't want to answer.`
` ...............No, I can't even be bothered to answer any more."`
`".........What is it? This isn't like you.`
` ......Did something happen?`
` Did Battler say someth—"`
`".........k...g...gyhh—"`
`{f:5:Beatrice} hadn't even responded.`
` It seemed that she had even ignored it.`
`But there was a change in Gaap.`
`From her feet, a crackling, cracking sound rose, like thin ice breaking,`
` ......and in an instant, turned Gaap into a glass sculpture.`
`"G‐......Gaap..."`
`"............Disappear for a while.`
` I'm in a very bad mood."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} spoke in a truly cold voice,`
` ......which froze the heart just to hear it.`
`"......Certainly.`
` In that case, please allow us to retire.`
` .........If you need anything, call at any time."`
`After a single bow, Ronove turned into a cloud of gold butterflies, and hid himself.`
`{f:5:Virgilia} turned Gaap from a sculpture into a group of gold butterflies,`
` and then turned into a cloud of them herself, which mixed in with the others and disappeared.`
`............In the study made untidy by drinking,`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice} stood still, alone.`
`Since the time she had returned, her expression hadn't changed in the slightest...`
`......However, when she saw the fallen empty wine bottles and scattered cheese plates,`
` her brow furrowed, and she looked a bit displeased.`
`And when she whispered "disappear", in that instant, the room flashed, and was tidy again, as though nothing had ever happened.`
`The reception chairs were neatly arranged, and there was no wine or cheese.`
`{n}There were no stains where things had been spilled, nor was there any scattered trash.`
`......To the contrary, even the air had frozen over,`
` and, enough to make one doubt whether so many noisy people really had been in this room until just moments ago,`
` .........the study had returned to total silence.`
`.........In that silent, ......frigid study where even the air had frozen,`
` {f:5:Beatrice} stood still...`
`Then, she called him in a mutter.`
`"..................Battler.`
` Are you there?"`
`"......I've been here for a while.`
` .........What the hell's going on with you?`
` You've been acting strange."`
`"Do I seem strange?`
` My apologies."`
`"............Even though you were having such a good time drinking with that damn old fart, you suddenly burned him up,`
` and your demoness friend is a glass sculpture.`
` ......Even your demon butler and your master got a "disappear and get the hell out".`
` ......Just how fickle and selfish are you?"`
`"Battler. I'm done."`
`"With what?"`
`"............I've had enough, now."`
`"Wha?`
` .........Well, uh, you were the one who cooked up this game.`
` Heh, if you've had enough, that's great for me.`
` So basically, you're resigning?"`
`"I am not resigning.`
` I am just ending it.`
` No, I won't even end it.`
` The game will simply be abandoned for all eternity."`
`"Pretty sure they call that resigning.`
` ......Man, the words "got tired of it and threw it away" fit you perfectly."`
`"Precisely.`
` I am tired of it and am throwing it away.`
` I don't care about the rest.`
` It can remain abandoned and gather dust as much as it likes."`
`"........................`
` ......What's up with you?`
` You've been kinda hard to deal with since a short while ago."`
`"......Are you still sour over that baffling test?`
` If you've got something against me, all you have to do is say it clearly."`
`"You said in red that it has nothing to do with you, but that's got to be a play on words, right?`
` It's written all over your face.`
` You have a grudge against me."`
`"How many times will I have to say I have no grudge against you before you'll understand?`
` At the time you left your sin behind, I did not exist."`
`As Beato spoke with an irritated expression, her face twisted to look even more displeased.`
`Fickle.`
` Inconsistent.`
` Moody.`
` Temperamental.`
` ......Selfish and simple‐minded and cruel.`
`But even so, she had never shown an expression as strange as this even once before now...`
`"............Well, you were the one who instigated this game.`
` I'm a bit let down that it won't get resolved, but feel free to invite me again sometime if you feel like it.`
` But when that time comes, allow me to politely decline, alright?`
` Heheheh."`
`He intentionally spoke in a teasing kind of tone, but Beato showed no reaction.`
`......Battler hung his head and clicked his tongue...`
`"I've circled around October 4th and 5th over and over again, but it looks like I'm finally going to be free of all that now.`
` ......This way, the boat will come tomorrow."`
`"...That's right, then the seagulls will return to the harbor.`
` ......I'll finally be able to hear Rokkenjima's signature "nyaa nyaa" cries.`
` After all, when I came to the island, they weren't there at all, maybe because of the weather."`
`".........‘When the seagulls cry, everything will end’, basically.`
` ......Done and done, all over, the end.`
` Man, what a relief."`
`".........Exactly what is it that you're misunderstanding?"`
`"Hm?`
` What do you mean what?"`
`".........I said that nothing would end.`
` With this, everything will be abandoned.`
` The game will be forgotten, and the pieces on the board will be left where they lie.`
` There will be no advancing, no retreating, no taking or being taken.`
` No victory, no defeat, not even a tie.`
` Just abandoned."`
`"............Doesn't that mean it's over?"`
`"Wrong.`
` On my turn, the game will stop for all eternity.`
` Your turn will not come.`
` So there will be no victory, nor defeat, nor a tie."`
`".........In the past, I could not allow you to do that to me.`
` That was because I had the goal of victory against you.`
` However, I have lost interest in that.`
` So there is no longer any point in me making any further moves."`
`"............What do you mean by...my turn won't come...?"`
`I'd thought that Beato getting tired of the game meant I'd be released, and I'd be able to escape Rokkenjima.`
`But for some reason, the meaning of Beato's repeated words about the difference between abandoning the game and settling it...`
`...was starting to bother me...`
`.........Just what has she been saying, ...and why the bad mood......?`
`Suddenly, I heard a voice from behind me.`
`When I turned around, ......there was someone I thought I might, or might not, remember from somewhere...`
`......A mysterious girl, with no light in her eyes, was standing there.`
`".........What she means is something like this.`
` ......Putting the lid back on this game, leaving the pieces as they are.`
` Without ending, the game will be locked away for all eternity."`
`"The only way for you to return to your original world is to win against Beato.`
` .........So Beato abandoning the game would mean...`
` ......Get it?"`
`Suddenly, in another place, there was a girl wearing a bright pink dress.`
`......I had a feeling I'd met her somewhere too, but I couldn't remember.`
`More important was the meaning of the words she said.`
`{n}......The game being abandoned means......huh?`
`".........That's all there is to it.`
` No match can reach its conclusion without two opposing sides.`
` .........It means that you'll never be able to win and escape this world for all eternity."`
`"In the end, ......it's kinda like taking the key to the cage that you're locked in,`
` fastening it to the collar of a pigeon or something and letting it fly, I guess."`
`"............This isn't funny, Beato.`
` We didn't come all the way here to watch a boring game like this.`
` Just wrapping it up here? You have to be kidding me."`
`".........I'm with Lambda.`
` I came here to make Battler win, and to make you thrash about in defeat.`
` I still haven't achieved that goal.`
` ......I couldn't bear for the game to be abandoned here, for you to just run away on me."`
`"I acknowledge that the way the curtain has fallen on this game has made for a disappointing end for you ladies.`
` ......However, I, the host of this tea party, am after all fickle.`
` Once the fun is gone, I know no way of entertaining.`
` ......I believe that to be what makes me the witch I am in the first place.`
` There should be no problems with this...?"`
`"..............................`
` ......True.`
` I won't go against your creed."`
`"I won't stand for this...`
` ......Don't you dare, how much do you think I've supported you...`
` All that preparation, and you want me just to pack it all in now?`
` I don't think so...!!"`
`"I am saying that I have tired of it.`
` Nothing more, nothing less."`
`"That's not happening...`
` You're going to continue this game.`
` You want to win against Battler, right?`
` You want to win and make him submit, right?!`
` You're almost there!`
` Isn't she~?!"`
`".........D‐don't turn to me for agreement.`
` ......That said, I do have an opinion too.`
` If you'll let me say it."`
`"............What."`
`"You brought this fight to my door.`
` I'm prepared to settle this fight one way or the other.`
` ......I've come close to surrendering many times,`
` but I've never had any intention of escaping part‐way through, leaving the match undecided."`
`"......As long as I'm here, showing the will to fight,`
` ......don't you go running away, {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"............I agree.`
` Getting Battler involved and then leaving without giving him victory or defeat is just beyond irresponsible."`
`Suddenly, even Gretel was there.`
`{n}......And everyone was criticizing Beato for being irresponsible.`
`"Hoh.`
` .........It seems that the greatest reason I am being called irresponsible is that Battler will be stuck as an opponent."`
`".........In that case, Battler.`
` Will you step down from being an opponent, as I shall?`
` That way, there will be nothing to criticize me for."`
`"If I step down, will I be able to leave Rokkenjima...?"`
`"Of course not.`
` Just be covered in dust and let it pile up on your shoulders."`
`".........Stop being so stupid.`
` Just how irresponsible are you?`
` You've killed all this many people.`
` On top of that, using your witch's power, you've done it over and over.`
` In gruesome ways!`
` .........There's no way I can allow you to escape without taking responsibility...!"`
`"Responsibility.`
` ......Hoh, what is it I should do to take this so‐called responsibility?"`
`"Fight until a resolution is reached.`
` Battler will sit in the chair across from you, never giving up, and fighting until he beats you.`
` So you too fight until you're defeated.`
` If you don't want that to happen, then try and defeat him...!!"`
`"I won't let you...leave everything unresolved and abandon Battler in this chair,`
` ......lock him up forevermore and never let him return...`
` .........I won't let you......!!"`
`"......Gretel."`
`To be perfectly honest,`
` I didn't really understand from what standpoint Gretel was trying to save me.`
`......But in her words,`
` I could feel a strong determination to save me from this crazy game world no matter what.`
`So, I also responded to that.`
`"Beato.`
` Face this way."`
`"....................."`
`"I am here.`
` Across from you, in the rival's seat.`
` ......Get it?`
` As long as I continue to sit here,`
` I won't permit you to escape.`
` ......So don't run away. Fight."`
`"You started this fight, dammit.`
` All the crap you've pulled, again and again and again, the total shitshow you've turned this whole thing into!`
` And now after all this time you think I can let you end it because you're {i:tired} of it?!!"`
`"I am your opponent!!`
` As long as I'm here,`
` there's no way I'm letting you escape!!"`
`"Are you listening, you goddamn Witch of Irresponsibility?!`
` Why don't you say some{-}thiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}ing!!!"`
`After I yelled at her, ......Beato went silent for a while.`
`Whether my words had reached her, or whether she was thinking about something completely different...I couldn't tell.`
`But for a while, she was silent,`
` ......gazing at me with an expression I could read no emotion from,`
` ......and when she realized that I noticed, she averted her gaze.`
`Then she turned her back to me, ......and said this...`
`"So you ladies say that......since Battler will not quit as my opponent, you cannot accept my abandonment of this game."`
`"............In that case, I shall ask...`
`whether the man over there was qualified to be my opponent in the first place."`
`".........Qualified?"`
`"...Probably has something to do with that test or whatever just now."`
`"...............What are you planning to do...?"`
`"...Y‐...you aren't gonna—"`
`"I will now question you to determine whether or not you are qualified to be my opponent."`
`".........Listen, now, Battler.`
` If those qualifications are acknowledged, I will stay in my seat and continue the game.`
` And I shall promise to fight for all eternity until the outcome is decided."`
`"Heh!`
` I was ready for that from the beginning."`
`"............However,`
` if you are not qualified,`
` ......you will disappear.`
` If the opponent disappears, there is no game.`
` I can leave this place openly.`
` .........Are you ladies satisfied?`
` I will not permit interruptions."`
`"..............................`
` ......Go ahead, do as you like."`
`"......B‐...Battler...`
` You......make sure you answer well..."`
`"The very reason I'm here is because I'm qualified, right?`
` Heh, there's nothing to be scared of...!"`
`".....................`
` .........Y‐......you couldn't be......"`
`Gretel grew suddenly pale.`
` ......I'd thought her to be the calm, collected type, so her expression surprised me.`
`"......Well then, Battler.`
` I shall have you repeat in red."`
`"Y‐you're giving me a repetition request?`
` Heheh... Damn you, stealing my signature move.`
` ...But can I do the red truth too?`
` How...?"`
`"............Ju‐just will it to be so and you can do it.`
` It's easy."`
`"{p:1:My name is Ushiromiya Battler}.`
` ......Wh‐......whoa, pretty cool."`
`"Stop it!!`
` I know what you're after...!!`
` But don't do it!`
` He's......!!"`
`When Gretel yelled, Beato glared at her.`
`{n}Then, her form was wiped away in an instant.`
`"Shut up.`
` You leave your seat for a while.`
` You too, ladies.`
` If you are going to interfere, I will not hold back."`
`"...............We won't get in the way.`
` Go ahead, do as you like."`
`"B‐Bern, this is bad!!`
` She's trying to erase him, she's trying to erase Battler!!"`
`"......What......?`
` What is it she's......scheming here......?"`
`"Well then, I shall question your qualifications.`
` ............Interesting.`
` Attack and defense are reversed from a normal game.`
` This is a very precious experience, coming at the very, very end.`
` .........Ready? First listen carefully.`
` I will speak with the red first."`
`{p:1:I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}}.`
`{p:1:And I opened this game in order to fight Ushiromiya Kinzo's grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler}.`
`"......I know that.`
` So what?"`
`"Repetition requested.`
` .........‘Ushiromiya Battler's mother is Ushiromiya Asumu’."`
`"Whaa?!`
` ...Why's Mom's name popping up all of a sudden......?"`
`"I do not require chatter.`
` Just repeat it in red."`
`Beato urged me with the same indifferent tone.`
`......But I don't have a clue what she's trying to do.`
`{n}......I've done absolutely nothing wrong that I'd hate to be confronted with, and there's nothing that I'm hiding.`
`There's nothing she could demand for me to repeat that would cause me any trouble.`
`{n}......So, why something like this...?`
`"Sure, I'll repeat it.`
` {p:1:Ushiromiya Battler's mother is Ushiromiya Asumu}.`
` ......The red sure is convenient.`
` No need to bother myself with bringing a copy of the family register."`
`"I do not require chatter.`
` I will continue.`
` "Your name is Ushiromiya Battler"."`
`"......Sure.`
` {p:1:My name is Ushiromiya Battler}."`
`"It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that Ushiromiya Battler was born."`
`"{p:1:It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that Ushiromiya Battler was born}."`
`"It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that you were born."`
`"{p:1:It was from Ushiromiya}...`
`{m:-5:—}—...`
`...hhnguh...`
`...{nobr:{m:-5:——}—}?!`
` {nobr:{m:-5:——}—}?!?!"`
`All of a sudden, my throat closed...`
`{n}I was suddenly assaulted by a shortness of breath that felt as if I had been choked.`
`Wh‐.........what's going on......?`
` O‐......one more time......`
`"It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born...`
` ...Dammit...`
` It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born..."`
`"............Wh‐what the hell?`
` Even though I was doing it so easily a second ago, I suddenly stopped being able to get the red to work...!"`
`"........................Do you decline to repeat it?"`
`"I'm not declining...!!`
` It's not working for some reason...!!`
` It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born...!!`
` Why?!`
` Dammit, why can't I use the red?!`
` What the hell?!?!"`
`"..................tch..."`
`"..........................."`
`My Mom is Ushiromiya Asumu!`
`{n}Why can't I say that fact in red?!`
`{n}What's going on...?!`
` Th‐this is......gghh—!!`
`"If you try to forcefully speak red that cannot be spoken, you will choke.`
` There is no need to strain yourself.`
` .........Allow me to use the aforementioned fact to press you in blue."`
`"......Do you remember?`
` The blue is used to proclaim a theory for the opponent to deny.`
` They are then burdened with the responsibility of denying that in red, and if they do not, then it is victory.`
` .........Then let me begin."`
`{p:2:Due to the previous repetition request, and the refusal to repeat,}`
` {p:2:I proclaim that you are not qualified to be my opponent}.`
`{p:2:After all,}`
` {p:2:{f:5:Beatrice} opened this game in order to fight with "Ushiromiya Kinzo's grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler"}.`
`{p:2:This gave you the responsibility, as my opponent,}`
` {p:2:to declare in red that you are "Ushiromiya Kinzo's grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler"}.`
`{p:2:You declined to repeat that}.`
`{p:2:This means the loss of your qualifications}.`
`"......D‐......deny something about that in red...`
` ...Quickly!!"`
`"S‐sure...`
` I,`
` {p:1:I am Ushiromiya Battler}...!`
` Given that I'm able to repeat that in red, that should mean that I'm your opponent!!"`
`"It may be a fact that you have the name Ushiromiya Battler.`
` However...`
` {p:2:People's names are not exclusive}.`
` {p:2:It is possible for multiple humans to have the name Ushiromiya Battler}."`
`"`
`{p:2:What it comes down to is this}.`
` ......{p:2:You are a different person with the same first and last names as Ushiromiya Asumu's son, Ushiromiya Battler}."`
`"Wh‐......what......?!!`
` Don't be so stupiiiiiiiiid!!`
` I'm Mom's kid!!`
` Ushiromiya Asumu's kid!!"`
`"`
`{p:1:It was from Ushiro}miya Asumu that...`
`—...`
`hkkhk—`
`......nn'g'g'gkkhh......!!!`
` ............*gasp*!"`
`"Shit!!`
` Why?!`
` Why can't I say that I was born from my mom?!`
` How could something so stupid be true?!"`
`"No need to suffer.`
` I will not toy with you.`
` ......This is checkmate.`
` {p:1:You are not Ushiromiya Asumu's son}."`
`...............Wha—...............`
`"You're.........`
`kidding......me..............."`
`"Who are you?`
` What person calling themselves Ushiromiya Battler?"`
`"W‐...wait a second...`
` ......I am...Ushiromiya Battler......`
` It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born, and I'm Mom and Dad's son...!"`
`"No.`
` There is no way that you are the Ushiromiya Battler with qualifications as my opponent.`
` And as proof..."`
`"Proof?!"`
`"You do not know of that sin six years ago."`
`".........Uh,`
` .........th‐that's............"`
`"No, if you were the true Ushiromiya Battler, you would not commit a sin.`
` But consequently, a sin did occur, a span of six years became a blank space,`
` and a man who knew nothing of that time appeared on Rokkenjima calling himself Ushiromiya Battler.`
` ............The truth of it all...goes like this."`
`Six years ago, ......the true Ushiromiya Battler, qualified to be my opponent, was already dead.`
`You were involved in a plot by Rudolf having something to do with distribution of the inheritance...`
`a body double set up in Ushiromiya Battler's place.`
`"I, ......I've never heard anything so stupid.........`
` .........That's......just......absurd............"`
`"......B‐Battler......!`
` Get ahold of yourself...!!"`
`"...........................Well.`
` ...If he can't counter back, there's nothing more to do.`
` ...Battler did not possess the qualifications.`
` That's how it is."`
`"A‐are you okay with that, Bern?!`
` If you accept that, you'll lose too, you know?!"`
`"Uh, and you'll win.`
` ......Why are you taking Battler's side......?"`
`"Mgh, ............mghhh..."`
`"How disappointing, Battler.`
` .........It really is disappointing that you didn't have the qualifications to be {f:5:Beatrice}'s opponent.`
` I was careless myself.`
` I can't believe I bet on an unqualified piece.`
` ............You've defeated me utterly, {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......There is no victory or defeat.`
` The opponent will simply disappear.`
` Perhaps I should say that he was never there in the first place."`
`"But then......who.........am I......?`
` Am I......not Mom and Dad's kid......?!"`
`"Who am I...... What am I......?`
` ............If I'm not Mom's kid, ......then what, are you saying I'm some total stranger's kid with no relation to them at all?!"`
`"If that is the case, it would mean that you do not share Kinzo's blood.`
` Either way, you are not qualified to compete in this game."`
`"...............Absurd.........`
`.........absurd..............."`
`"Enough.`
` ......I was slightly aware that you might not be Ushiromiya Battler in the first place.`
` ......So, I had to question you.`
` I had to ask about something the real Battler would have known."`
`"............What a shame.`
` I even bet on the one in a quadrillion chance of a miracle,`
` that you might really be Ushiromiya Battler.`
` However, it looks like you're a different person with the same first and last names after all."`
`"............kh.........uuunghhh............"`
`Bit by bit, Battler's form......began to be clouded in darkness...`
`No, maybe it was the other way around.`
` ......The whole world was becoming clouded in darkness, leaving only Battler behind...`
`Battler was down on all fours, hanging his head and repeatedly questioning himself.`
`......However, he would never be given an answer......`
`In the world stained with darkness, Beato spoke something, and {f:5:Lambdadelta} ran up to Battler yelling something very quickly,`
` but it already seemed very far away, and it didn't reach his ears...`
`............Then he,`
` .........not knowing who "he" was,`
` ............erased...`
`himself............`
`"BATTLEEEEEEEEEEER......!! ......nn...gh........."`
`"Now the opponent has disappeared.`
` ......Well then, if you would excuse me.`
` And ladies, you should prepare for your journey.`
` No more festivities are prepared for in my territory.`
` It was good seeing you.`
` ......Goodbye."`
`Without saying anything more,`
` Beato clouded her own form in darkness as well, and disappeared......`
`"A‐.........are you......alright with this?!`
` Battler......d‐disappeared, you know?!`
` Someone who hates losing as much as you do is okay with this?!"`
`"..................Weren't you betting on my defeat?`
` Then you should be over the moon.`
` Congrats, Lambda.`
` Well then, let's meet again in some other world, okay?"`
`"That said, there are endless fragment worlds out there.`
` The probability of us having some connection again somewhere is probably truly less than one in a quadrillion.`
` ............Alright, it was fun.`
` Bye‐bye."`
`"Ah, ...wait up, Bern...!!!"`
`Chasing after {f:5:Bernkastel}, who had disappeared first, {f:5:Lambdadelta} disappeared as well...`
`Then, after everyone had disappeared, .........there was no one left in the study.`
`It returned to silence, almost as though no one had been there from the beginning.`
`{n}......No one was here in the first place.`
`The silent study told of that wordlessly, and the sound of the wind and rain began to fill the room bit by bit......`
`In a world where everything had sunk into darkness, Beato questioned herself.`
`"......The fact is............from the very beginning, magic should only have been used within Mariage Sorcière."`
`"............Yes.`
` ...I thought that too,`
` ......when Ange happened."`
`"The witches' alliance began with you and me.`
` Just two people.`
` ......Mixing in other people was the first mistake..."`
`".........It was just so much fun.`
` ...That's why we wanted to add other people close to us into that circle.`
` And in that way, we wished for the witches' alliance to grow forever larger,`
` so everyone could have fun using magic together, and all become happy."`
`"But.........in the end, you and I were the only ones able to understand magic."`
`"We're......the only two witches in this world, brought together by a miracle.`
` .........As long as I have you, Beato, I don't need anyone else anymore."`
`"............Nor I.`
` As long as you are here, I no longer need anyone else."`
`"In the very first moment that Mariage Sorcière was formed,`
` ......it was already complete."`
`"...............That is...so.`
` That is truly so......"`
`It was a witches' alliance to make everyone happy together, with magic.`
`{n}......I wonder when it got this screwed up?`
`What was I trying to do when I started this game?`
`{n}......I can't really remember even that.`
`No, I may remember,`
` ...but that's a feeling I now wish to throw away to the far side of oblivion.`
`".........It's alright.`
` Let's just forget everything, okay?`
` Our little two‐person Mariage Sorcière.`
` ......We'll accept each other.`
` And no one will be able to hurt us.`
` So we won't be hurt anymore. We won't cry."`
`"Let's forget everything.`
` ............Okay, Beato?`
` ......We...are eternal......"`
`"..............................Maria......`
` ............uuuuuuuu, .........uuuuuuuuuuuuu...!!"`
