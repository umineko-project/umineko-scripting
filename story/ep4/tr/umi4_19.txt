`The world whitened......`
`It wasn't "white".`
` ...It was the blindingly bright color of gold.`
`That place......was the beautiful Ushiromiya family rose garden.`
`However, the roses were all gold.`
`......The nectar was also golden.`
` The butterflies gathering there were gold as well.`
`............This is...the Golden Land............`
`The promised land that the witches of Mariage Sorcière would ultimately be guided to...`
`There, all wishes come true, and all magic and dreams come into being.`
`............In that garden of gold roses...`
`............were two, and only two, witches.`
`At my uninvited appearance,`
` the atmosphere trembled with unrest.`
`.........What was to them an ominous wind shook the golden roses.`
`The incredibly beautiful scene formed by the golden rose petals scattering in the wind...`
`was, without a doubt, something not of this world......`
`The two who had been taking a walk through the golden roses noticed me and reacted in surprise.`
`"......Ange......?`
` .........Beato, it's Ange......!!"`
`"...............How did you get here...?`
` .........Leave us alone.`
` I no longer invite anyone here."`
`Beato spoke coldly.`
` .........She seemed like a completely different person from the boldly sneering woman she had once been.`
`She had closed off her heart, and shut herself up in a world where she was alone with Maria onee‐chan.`
`A world where she could always be alone with friendly Maria onee‐chan,`
` conversing about magic while drinking tea.`
`......No one to hurry them, and nothing to hold them back.`
`A world where not a single person who might hurt them existed.`
`Yes, to the two of them, that was a small and complete universe......`
`".........Sorry.`
` ......I can't have you shutting yourself up in here.`
` .........The game won't move on unless you come back."`
`"I said I was tired of it and I'm done with it.`
` I will not return to the game anymore."`
`"...............Beato is going to be here all the time with me.`
` We'll drink tea here together, and think of lots of ways to play...!`
` You can play with us too, Ange."`
`"......{f:5:Maria}.`
` We decided against that.`
` As long as I have you, I am satisfied.`
` Tell me that you too are satisfied as long as you have me."`
`".....................`
` ......Yeah.`
` ......Thank you.`
` The only person who needs me that much is you, Beato.`
` So I'll be with you.`
` Just us is enough."`
`".........{f:5:Maria}...... ......Thank you......`
` ............I am grateful........."`
`Beato held Maria tight,`
` even creating a small, warm universe within their joined arms...`
`.........It was probably the birth of the smallest universe in the world.`
`{n}...The smallest universe in the world, which a pair who needed each other could create...`
`No matter how small it was, that world was complete.`
`{n}............But I have to tear it apart.`
`{n}.....................`
`"......Sorry,`
` .........but I can't let things be that way.`
` I came to smash this Golden Land of Mariage Sorcière."`
`"............Why...`
`...would you break...`
`...my world.........?`
` Wh‐who has this world inconvenienced, outside Maria and myself......?!"`
`"This game that you started, and then walked away from without finishing,`
` is keeping Onii‐chan waiting forever!`
` If you don't return to your seat, the match will never end...!!"`
`".........Hahahahaha...ha...!`
` There is no longer even a single player in that game.`
` Battler vanished, and I came here and vanished as well.`
` That game is already over."`
`"It is not over!`
` You started that game, didn't you?!!`
` Take proper responsibility and see it through to the very end!"`
`"Either defeat Battler, and give birth to the world you truly wished for,`
` or be defeated and release everything swallowed up by your magic!!`
` Take responsibility until the very end!!"`
`"...............Don't, Ange.`
` Beato will spend her time in this world with me, just the two of us together for eternity.`
` ......And I don't need anything else either, as long as I have Beato.`
` ......All wishes come true here.`
` Everything is here."`
`............This Golden Land is made up of nothing more than the crystallization of Maria onee‐chan and {f:5:Beatrice}'s thoughts and feelings.`
`......To drag Beato out of this world,`
` ......I have to...`
`...destroy it.........`
`..................Destroy this Golden Land,`
` .........which must be the final world of peace for {f:5:Beatrice}......`
`"Onee‐chan. That's wrong.`
` This Golden Land is a liar.`
` It hasn't granted the one wish you truly wanted to come true."`
`".........That's not true!!`
` Everything is granted here!`
` Look, there's even a nice Mama here!!"`
`Gold butterflies gathered behind Maria,`
` forming into a kindly smiling Aunt Rosa.`
`.........And after smiling sweetly at me,`
` she softly became golden petals and crumbled.`
`"Anything can be created here.`
` Even you can be, and Battler, and George onii‐chan, and Jessica onee‐chan...!!`
` You can summon as many as you want, and everyone is nice...!!`
` You come too, Ange, let's play together......!!"`
`............Sorry, Onee‐chan............`
`"And what about Sakutarou......?"`
`".........—"`
`Upon hearing Sakutarou's name, Onee‐chan's face looked like she was choking.`
`"Stop it......`
` Do not speak that name......"`
`Beato's expression changed as well.`
`{n}And she put her arm around Maria, hugging her as if to protect her.`
`.........Sakutarou's name was still taboo for Onee‐chan.`
`"Why can't I say it?`
` It's the name of Maria onee‐chan's best friend."`
`"......Why won't you invite that close friend to this wonderful Golden Land?`
` Why, in this Golden Land where all wishes come true, is Sakutarou the only one you can't summon?"`
`"Th‐...that's because......`
` ......It's alright, {f:5:Maria}.`
` You don't have to remember Sakutarou—"`
`"............Sakutaro was killed by Mama!!!!"`
`Maria onee‐chan flew into a rage with a terrible expression on her face.`
`Surprised by that voice, butterflies flew up throughout the garden,`
` ......blowing around like a typhoon of flower petals.`
`"Yes, I know.`
` Aunt Rosa......took your precious stuffed animal Sakutarou, and tore him apart......!!"`
`"GYAAAAAAAaaaAAAAAAAAAAaAAAaaAAHHHH!!!"`
`Maria's scream became a storm and violently scattered the golden petals and leaves.`
`It was truly a storm of gold.`
`"Stop...!!`
` Stop stop stop...!!!`
` Why are you trying to reopen the wound in {f:5:Maria}'s heart...?!`
` Don't defile the sleep of a dear friend precious to both Maria and myself...!!"`
`"In that case, why won't you revive that precious friend for her with your magic?"`
`"I would have if I could...!!`
` But that stuffed animal was an article Rosa created herself!`
` The magical meaning of that unique object being torn apart is—"`
`"You aren't fooling anyone.`
` Why can't you revive Sakutarou?`
` There's only one answer.`
` It's because you aren't a real witch!"`
`".........I most certainly can revive him...!!`
` With my magic, I can revive him as often as I want, like this!!"`
`"I could even bury this garden in Sakutarous...!!"`
`"Yeah, I'll bet you could, with your magic!`
` But Onee‐chan definitely wouldn't be able to see the Sakutarous you create!"`
`"............You know why, right?`
` I'll say it again.`
` It's because you aren't a real witch...!!"`
`"Stop iiiiiiiiiit!!`
` Why do you keep saying such mean things, Ange...?!`
` Beato can use a lot of magic...!`
` She's a very wonderful witch...!!"`
`"Sakutaro was the one thing she couldn't revive, ......but she can do anything else...!!`
` So I can......put up with...`
`not having Sakutaro......"`
`"No, Onee‐chan, that's wrong.`
` .........There's nothing a witch can't do.`
` As soon as she couldn't do that,`
` {f:5:Beatrice} was not a real witch."`
`"Tha‐that's wrong......!!`
` It's because Sakutaro's stuffed animal vessel was something Mama made by hand herself, and—"`
`"And that's why she can't revive him?`
` Is {f:5:Beatrice}'s... Is your magic that inconvenient?"`
`"Gah, .........i‐......in that case, ......do you claim that you {i:can} revive Sakutarou?!`
` Can you do that with your magic?!"`
`"I can."`
`".........What........."`
`"Maria onee‐chan!!`
` I'll show you some real magic.`
` I'll revive Sakutarou for you!!"`
`"......Re‐`
`.........really......?`
` Even {f:5:Beatrice} couldn't do it, you know......?`
` ...Ca‐`
`.........can you really......?!"`
`"Yes, I can!`
` In exchange, promise me.`
` Once I've revived Sakutarou..."`
`"Yes...!"`
`"Leave this Golden Land."`
`"............!"`
`"I, I will not permit that...!!`
` This world is {f:5:Maria}'s and mine together!!`
` If {f:5:Maria} leaves,`
` ......it will break...!!"`
`The minimum amount of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s it takes to create a universe is two.`
`{n}If that breaks down, the world is destroyed.`
`To drag out the witch who shut herself away in the Golden Land, I have to destroy this world...!`
`"......Yes, and that is the proof that you are not a witch.`
` ......A real witch can create a universe alone."`
`"The Mariage Sorcière Alliance of Witches!`
` ......The very existence of this alliance proves that you are not a witch...!!"`
`"N‐no...!!`
` I will not give up {f:5:Maria}...!!`
` I hate you, leave right now...!!`
` Get out of heeeeeeeeeere!!"`
`"Dragging everyone into a game of your own accord, then getting bored and chasing them out when your mood changes!!`
` How selfish can you be?"`
`"Watch and learn, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` And you, Maria onee‐chan!!`
` This...is true magic.........!!!"`
`"Ca‐......can you really revive Sakutaro...?!"`
`"There's no way!!`
` This is a Golden Land for Maria and me alone...!`
` There is not a single piece of magic that an outsider like you could use here!`
` As you are now, you couldn't even create a single butterfly!!"`
`"Be quiet, Beato!!`
` Don't get in Ange's way...!!"`
`When Maria yelled,`
` ......the storm abruptly stopped, and the area returned to silence.`
`.........As the massive amount of golden petals that had been blown upwards quietly drifted down,`
` ......that scene looked so fantastical, as though a golden snow was falling......`
`Maria, thinking about this unlikely, if‐only miracle,`
` unconsciously joined her hands together as though praying.`
`......Beato's heart raced as she watched Maria do this.`
`.........If the extremely unlikely were to happen,`
` ...Maria would,`
` ......this world would......`
`But......it's inconceivable......!`
` An absolute impossibility...`
`That stuffed animal, the only one of its kind in the world, was torn apart and thrown away,`
` and not a thread remained.`
`Reviving it is an absolutely certain impossibility......!!`
`{p:1:This is my Golden Land}...!`
`{p:1:A world where magic that isn't mine certainly cannot exist}!!!`
`"G‐`
`......go right ahead,`
` ......I defy you to do it, Ushiromiya Angeeeee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eee!!!"`
`At Beato's scream, the world lost its sound.`
`I slowly...recited the incantation...for true magic......`
`"...............Come, try to remember.`
` Maria's close friend Sakutarou."`
`".........Try to remember what form you had."`
`".........Try to remember what a lovable stuffed animal you were."`
`"Huh, ..................ah, ...ah........."`
`"....................................!"`
`......Expressions of shock rose to both of their faces.`
`Then, ......pushing Beato's elbow aside, Maria dashed forward......`
`".........kutaro.........`
` .........Sakutarooo.........!!"`
`Then,`
` ............she threw her arms around him and me both.`
`"......It's alright.`
` Sakutarou...won't disappear.`
` ............`
` ‘Uryu,`
` Maria. I'm back.’"`
`"Sakutaro,`
` ......Sakutaro......`
` ......uuuuuuuuuuuuuuu,`
` waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuu!!`
` Sakutarooooooo......`
` I missed you......`
`...so much..............."`
`It was, unmistakably,`
` .........that lion,`
` ......that Sakutarou stuffed animal.`
`Maria had forgotten its softness, its texture, its stitches,`
` .........its everything.`
`But,`
` .........the instant she hugged the stuffed animal, everything came back to her vividly......`
`‘Uryu.`
` Maria,`
` ......I'm back.’`
`"Sakutaro, Sakutaro...!!`
` Is your body alright?`
` You aren't hurting anywhere?`
` Even though something so......horrible was done to you, you're alright everywhere......?!"`
`‘Uryu...!`
` Ange revived me with magic, so I'm perfectly fine...!’`
`"I'm so glad......`
` I'm so glad......`
` Welcome back, Sakutaro......`
`uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!"`
`‘I'll always be with you from now on, Maria.`
` Together forever.`
` ......So don't...`
`let go of me, okay.........?’`
`"Yeah, ......won't let go......`
` ......Never ever....................."`
`Then, still hugging Sakutarou,`
` she looked up at me with tear‐filled eyes...`
`"......Thank you, Ange...!`
` .........Your magic is amazing......`
` ......Why?`
` Why were you able to revive Sakutarou?!`
` Even Beato couldn't do it...!"`
`"..................Impossible...`
` ......Impossible......`
` ......How?`
` ......How can a human other than me use magic in my Golden Land?!?!`
` This is...`
`......completely impossible.........!"`
`"What are you so flustered about, {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` ..................This is...magic, right?"`
`"It cannot possibly be magic...!!`
` {p:1:This is my Golden Land}!!`
` {p:1:A world where magic that isn't mine certainly cannot exist}!!`
` And my`
` {p:1:magic was not able to revive Sakutarou}...!!"`
`"There's no way it could!!`
` {p:1:That stuffed animal was a special stuffed animal}!`
` {p:1:Rosa made it for her daughter's birthday, and in the entire world, only one of its kind}—`
`.........—`
`...............u...`
`...............hh......"`
`".....................See,`
` ...it's magic, right?"`
`"Ah...`
`......oh......`
`......ahh...`
`.........aaahhh,`
` .........aah...h...hh...hhhh......"`
`With this miracle that she could not possibly accept,`
` .........Beato...understood all of my magic......`
`And she looked at Maria and Sakutarou innocently frolicking around,`
` ......looked at me,`
` .........and then...`
`......fell to her knees,`
` ......with even her hands pressed to the ground,`
` ...............and cried.`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}...! This is really magic, right...?!`
` It's magic, right?!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}...!!!"`
`"...............Mm.........`
` ......It is magic......`
` ......That is...`
`......true...`
`......magic........."`
`"How can Ange use a magic that even Beato can't do?!`
` How?!`
` How?!`
` Ange's awesome, Ange's an awesome witch!`
` A real witch who's much, much more amazing than me......!!!"`
`"Yes, that's right, Onee‐chan.`
` ...............I am the Witch of Resurrection, {f:5:Ange}.`
` ......There is nothing that cannot be revived by me."`
`"Oh wow, oh wow!!`
` Even Beato said that the magic of resurrection was the hardest!!`
` {f:5:Ange}, you're awesome!!`
` A real real Great Witch......!!!"`
`At that moment, Maria's and Sakutarou's forms flashed gold,`
` ......and the two became golden flower petals, and crumbled away......`
`As the two became a golden wind and swirled together,`
` .........they left for some other place of peace.`
`Beato had, ......as promised, banished Maria from the Golden Land.`
`"......Goodbye, ...Maria onee‐chan.`
` And be happy forever.`
` ............It's alright, I'm sure "you" exist in Onee‐chan's world as well.`
` But that {i:doesn't refer to you}."`
`"...............I am happy for you,`
` ......Maria......`
` ......As your close friend,`
` .........I celebrate this reunion...from the bottom of my heart........."`
`On Beato's face......was a mixture of what was probably every expression a human could muster.`
`That expression—`
`it was joy,`
` it was anger,`
` it was sadness.`
`".........That is the basis of magic, isn't it.`
` ............Without love,`
` without sadness,`
` without anger,`
` ............magic cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}."`
`The ground shook.`
` ......An earthquake.`
`.........It gradually caused greater and greater fissures,`
` and began to tear {f:5:Beatrice}'s final paradise apart.`
`Golden butterflies fluttered about trying to escape, but there was nowhere to escape to.`
`{n}...Nor for {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`The Golden Land began to crumble away.`
`The earth gave way like a floor falling through,`
` .........and {f:5:Beatrice} was sucked into the depths of a jet‐black darkness.`
`Then, she was mercilessly slammed against a jet‐black floor.`
`......It was a small, nondescript, and very dimly lit smoking room.`
`There was no door to exit by, and while there were windows,`
` ......they let no light into this place—{f:5:Beatrice}'s smoking room.`
`Even as Beato moaned from the pain of being slammed against that cold hard floor,`
` she shakily rose to her feet......`
`A seat was there.`
`......And the game table, ......still just as it had been when she had left it.`
`The game board, too, was preserved in the same state in which Beato had abandoned it.`
`"That is your seat.`
` Sit."`
`"...............So, this is the only seat...`
`......for me to sit in........."`
`Beato put a hand against her own seat, ......and laughed sadly.`
`"Win, or lose.`
` That is all you are given.`
` A tie during the process of reaching that point will probably be permitted."`
`".........But the one thing I will {i:not} allow is for you to suspend the game and throw it away!`
` Either win and survive, or lose and disappear!`
` Until one of those two things happens, you will not be permitted to rise from that chair!!"`
`"Isn't that your only duty as the host of a witch's game, as the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}...?!!"`
`Laughing weakly, Beato...`
`...sat down.`
`......Then she rested her elbows on the table, covered her face with both hands,`
` .........and managed to put together a smile with just her mouth.`
`".........Not permitted to escape an unwinnable game.`
` .........Very well, then.`
` ......Why don't I repeat this......until I lose......"`
`"Spare me the pity show!`
` Win.`
` Use the very best moves you have...!!`
` You started this game!`
` You have a duty to make the best moves possible!!`
` Enough with all this indecisive fooling around!"`
`Just then, there was a heavy sound.`
`{n}......Beato felt a cold and pitiful sensation on her leg.`
`"......Gotcha...!`
` I finally got you, eh, Beato~?"`
`"Oh, if it isn't the great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}...`
` .........To think that you were still here."`
`Beato's foot was locked in an ice‐cold steel shackle,`
` ......fastening her to the chair she sat in.`
`......She would no longer be able to escape from this seat.`
`"Oh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!`
` You won't be able to escape anymore, got it?`
` I'm more persistent than I look. Surprising, huh?"`
`"............I'm more surprised that you weren't already aware of it."`
`"You are not permitted to leave early or suspend the game.`
` You'll fight for all eternity, in order to win, of course.`
` .........You don't want to lose, right?`
` You wanna little peek at the kind of wonderful world you'll be thrown into if you loooose?"`
`"Don't worry...`
` You can win... {i:Until you do}, I, the great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, will stick right by you and look after you for all eternity...!!"`
`".................................`
` ......Hmph, ......hahahahaha.`
` .........But even if I wish to fight, I have no opponent across from me, correct......?"`
`".........It's alright, I've found Battler."`
`When {f:5:Bernkastel} appeared and clapped her hands,`
` Battler appeared from the sky and plopped into the opposite chair.`
`Battler's eyes were slightly opened, but there was no sparkle in them, almost like a doll.`
`Without the one pillar that established his soul,`
` ............he had fallen into the very depths of darkness, and had been drifting about all this time.`
`......By rights, he should have dispersed and vanished like mist.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} had managed to scrape him together.`
`{n}It was surprising that she had managed to bring him back into a human form.`
`However, even though his body had returned, his soul had not.`
`{n}......It was blown away when his existence was denied by {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}It wouldn't come back easily.`
`"...............Battler won't run from this fight either.`
` Not until he beats you.`
` ......We won't permit such boorishness as to throw everything away and run just because the chances of winning have grown slim."`
`"Not even he himself wants that.`
` ............Right, Ushiromiya Battler...?"`
`Battler didn't answer.`
` ......His heart was still...dead.`
`His eyes wavered slightly at the question, but he couldn't answer.`
`"Battler...!`
` Get ahold of yourself!`
` You are here.`
` And the enemy is before your eyes...!`
` Fight!`
` Fight to win!!"`
`Battler lazily and incoherently parroted her words.`
`.........He was back.`
`But the trauma inflicted on his soul was no small thing.`
`That was only natural.`
`{n}{f:5:Beatrice} had woven her red, and he had been denied.`
`He had learned that the mother he had respected was not his birth mother,`
` .........and he didn't know who he was.`
`......I am not...`
`...Ushiromiya Battler............`
`"Don't talk stupid!`
` You are Ushiromiya Battler and no one else!"`
`"No matter who else admits that or denies that, make sure you believe it yourself...!!`
` You are the only one who can create your own world, you know.`
` Don't lose the world where you are Ushiromiya Battler!"`
`"...............Then,`
` ............who...`
`...am I.........?`
` I'm not Mom's kid......`
` Where was I born from......?"`
`Battler asked while gazing lazily up at the ceiling, with eyes that still hadn't regained their sparkle.`
`Of course, she answered right away.`
`"Yes, that's true.`
` Beato declared it with the red truth.`
` ......So I'll declare it too.`
` {p:1:Ushiromiya Battler is not Ushiromiya Asumu's son}."`
`".........Hmph, ......in that case, he is not qualified to be the opponent in my game, is he..."`
`"Repetition request for {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` "Ushiromiya Battler is not Ushiromiya Kinzo's grandchild"."`
`".............................."`
`As Beato wrinkled her forehead,`
` ......a pained smile rose to her face.`
`"Declining to repeat, I see.`
` Beato declared two red truths:`
` "{p:1:You are not Asumu's son}",`
` and`
` "{p:1:No one except Kinzo's grandchild Battler is qualified to be her opponent}"."`
`"The following theory will see you accepted as qualified without any contradictions.`
` This is my blue truth—listen to this...!"`
`{p:2:The one who is qualified to be Beato's opponent is "Kinzo's grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler",}`
` {p:2:and whether that person is "Asumu's son" or not is not an issue}.`
`{p:2:In other words, you can be Kinzo's grandchild even if you are not Asumu's son}.`
`{p:2:As long as you are Rudolf's son}!`
`"Hmph, what a stupid word game."`
`"...............Blue truth, valid.`
` Beato, your counterargument with the red truth?`
` If you cannot counter it with the red truth, there is no problem with Battler's qualifications as an opponent."`
`"................................."`
`.........Battler was still out of it.`
`{n}He still couldn't really understand what she was saying for him.`
`......But even so, his spirit was starting to come back bit by bit...`
`"..................Then,`
` ............who...`
`......am I......?"`
`"Get ahold of yourself!`
` You are Ushiromiya Battler!`
` Yeah, maybe Asumu okaa‐san didn't give birth to you.`
` But so what?!`
` That doesn't change in the slightest the fact that she was a mother to you, right?!"`
`".........For example, what is Ushiromiya Ange to you?`
` You might not share the same blood, but she's still your little sister, right?!`
` It's not about blood, it's about bonds, isn't it?!"`
`"............Well...yeah......`
` ......Even though we don't share the same blood, ......Ange is...`
`......my little sister."`
`"Say it in red!`
` Say that Ange is your little sister!!"`
`".........`
`{p:1:Ange is......my little sister}.`
` .........ah, ............it worked."`
`She hugged Battler, who was still out of it and slumped in his chair, strongly from behind.`
` So strongly that it hurt.`
`"I don't know why Asumu okaa‐san wasn't your birth mother.`
` But still, until today you believed that she was your mother, and you still do, right?!`
` In this world, there are plenty of people without even a mother,`
` ......without even a family!!"`
`"Did Asumu okaa‐san ever let you feel lonely?`
` Never, right?!`
` Don't throw your peaceful family away so easily!!`
` Your family bonds have gotten way too thin after leaving your family for six years!!"`
`"You have to feel those family bonds much, much more strongly!`
` Remember!!`
` For Asumu okaa‐san's sake, don't lose your affection because of some stupid ravings from a witch!"`
`"...........................`
` .........You're right......`
` ......Mom was......always on my side......"`
`"...............Where is this place......?`
` ......It's dark......`
` ......I wanna go home......`
` Where's...`
`all of my...`
`...family.........?"`
`The light still hadn't returned to Battler's eyes.`
`{n}But......tears formed there.`
`"Your little sister is waiting at home for you to come back.`
` She needs you at least to come back, ......or she'll be all alone forever...!`
` For your little sister's sake if nothing else, please win this witch's game...!!"`
`"............Ange......`
` My...`
`...little sister.........`
` ......But the thing is...`
`......I don't know anymore...`
` .........Why do I...`
`have to keep repeating this incomprehensible, cruel game with Beato forever......?`
` ......I've...`
`...had enough........."`
`"In that case, hurry up and finish off this game and go back home!!`
` Ushiromiya Battler, how long are you going to play around in a place like this?!`
` Your little sister is waiting for you to come home!!!"`
`.........That's right.`
`Battler was caught up in this strange game before he even knew it.`
`And, unable to understand what he was fighting for,`
` he was taken along at the witch's pace, toyed with and made to fight, for a very long time.`
`That should have been the simplest and first question.`
`......Not understanding that is why he loses his purpose for fighting...!!`
`It's why my voice doesn't reach his ears...!`
`What he needs is not some vague purpose, like winning against the witch, or because she's unforgivable.`
`......He needs to become aware of a purpose for which he {i:must} win.`
`".........That's right......`
` ......I want to go home......`
` ......To Mom and Dad,`
` ......and Ange......`
` .........I've had enough,`
` ......enough of this place......`
` ......I've had enough of witches, I've had enough of games and murders......`
`......enough,`
` enough......"`
`"Battler's soul...is starting to come back."`
`"...............But it can't quite reach."`
`"You've had enough, right?!`
` Then fight so you can return to your family!!`
` Destroy {f:5:Beatrice} and come home!!"`
`"No, ......no more witches...!`
` Enough of Beato, ...enough of everything...and you too, you're probably just another one of the witch's allies...`
` I could be betrayed again at any time...!!"`
`"{p:1:I can't trust anything, I can't trust any words that aren't red}...!!`
` Leave me alone, leave me alo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooone!!"`
`Battler's soul howled.`
` She hugged his head from behind, so tightly that it hurt.`
`"{p:1:Hurry up and come home, Onii‐chan}!!`
` {p:1:Don't leave me all alone}!!!"`
`"...............Huh......?`
` .........Who...`
`...............are you......?"`
`"{p:1:It's me, it's Ange}...!!`
` {p:1:No one's coming back home, Onii‐chan, not you, not Mom, not Dad}!!`
` {p:1:I'm so lonely}!!`
` {p:1:Please, hurry up and come home}!"`
`"......A‐.........Ange......`
` .........So you were.........Ange............"`
`"{p:1:That's right, I'm Ange}!!`
` {p:1:The Ushiromiya Ange of a world where no one comes home}...!!`
` .........{p:1:My entire family...never came home from Rokkenjima that day}...!!"`
`"{p:1:The witch before your eyes stole away my whole family, even you}...!`
` .........{p:1:Only you can finish her, Onii‐chan}!!`
` {p:1:Finish her}...!!"`
`"{p:1:And take your family back}!!`
` {p:1:And then.........come home to me}......!!!"`
`"...............Beato stole...`
`...my family........."`
`"......Hmph, ............as she says.`
` I will not run away or hide from it.`
` ......I stole Ushiromiya Ange's family away from her."`
`"Battler is my toy!`
` His father and mother too, all of them are my toys.`
` ......I won't give them back to you.`
` ......You may continue to wander alone forever, awaiting the return of your family that is never to be......!"`
`From Ange's arms that held him, ............the very painful, sad, and lonely days...`
`...that his little sister, left all alone, had gone through...flowed into Battler......`
`......Because he had been playing around in a place like this,`
` ............his little sister had been left all alone, .........and had been forced to endure...`
`.........such painful days...............!!`
`"...Ange, .........Ange.........!!`
` Shit, ......I've, .........what have I been doing.........?!!`
` Thanks a bunch, Ange...`
` Onii‐chan......has been forgetting something important this whole time......!"`
`Battler tried to turn around,`
` but Ange was clutching his head with an incredible force, so he couldn't.`
`......Sweat?`
`Hot drops splashed the back of Battler's neck.`
`......What they were...he discovered by holding Ange's arm as she clung to him.`
`.........Because it stained Battler's hand...his fingers...red.`
`".........Blood...`
` ......A‐Ange?!`
` A‐are you alright?!`
` H‐hey......?!"`
`It dripped and splashed.`
`He didn't know what was going on.`
`Battler couldn't tell for sure because he couldn't turn around,`
` but the hot drops staining his entire back were surely......blood.`
`"............In order to save you, Onii‐chan,`
` in order to come here,`
` there was a single rule that I wasn't allowed to...`
`...break...`
` .........This...`
`.........was it.`
` .........Letting you...`
`......find out...`
`...that I was...`
`...Ange........."`
`......It was so hard.........`
`My onii‐chan was right before my eyes, ......and I couldn't even tell him.........`
`If I'd just followed the rule, ......I would have been able to stay by your side forever.`
`.........You and me together...`
`...playing the game against the witch...`
`...for eternity......`
`"But...`
`......that's no good."`
`"............Onii‐`
`......ah...`
`.........chan,`
` ......you have to go back."`
`".........Back home,`
` ......your sister is waiting for you......"`
`".........That person isn't me,`
` ............but this way, your sister...`
`will find her salvation........."`
`"Ange?!`
` Ange!!`
` There's so much blood...!!`
` So much, so much!!"`
`He wanted to turn around, but he couldn't because of how tightly Ange was gripping his head.`
`However, judging by the blood that was pouring out and Ange's pained breathing,`
` he realized that something seriously wrong was happening to her right now.`
`"............Don't...worry.........`
` ......I am just......a piece......`
` .........You know, in chess, ......they have this thing called a <sacrifice>......"`
`"Sacri—......what?!`
` Who cares about that!!`
` Let's get you some first‐aid quickly!!`
` Let go for a second, Ange...!!"`
`".........A <sacrifice>...is a thrown piece.`
` For the sake of the strategic vision, you intentionally let a piece go, in full awareness of the loss..."`
`The ultimate goal in chess is victory against the opponent.`
`{n}......So sacrificing a few individual pieces is no problem if that can bring you to victory in the end.`
`Ange had made a levelheaded decision.`
`.........She had been told over and over again that she was a piece, not a player.`
`......In order to act like a piece and save Battler, right now, she herself needed to become a sacrificial piece.`
`............Battler had to be made aware.`
`His purpose in playing this witch's game must not be something abstract like finishing off the witch.`
`He needs to win the game, he needs to release himself, and he needs to bring his family back home.`
`Why?`
` .........Because he has family—a little sister—waiting for him to come home.`
`A being created to bring Ushiromiya Ange's voice to him...`
`{i:That} is who {f:5:Ange Beatrice} is—who I am...!!`
`I will use the piece I am as a sacrifice...`
`to give Onii‐chan the will to fight, to give him purpose!`
`Onii‐chan, my purpose is not to play with you in a witch's game for all eternity!`
`I came to bring you Ushiromiya Ange's mourning and sadness!`
` That is my unshakable purpose!`
`"......Ange!!`
` Ange!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaarrrghhh!!!"`
`The white, skinny arm holding Battler......was pale and transparent, almost like wax.`
`...But it was stained, so cruelly, with fresh blood......`
`"...I'm.........`
`...going to disappear now, but......`
`......you fight with all you've got,`
` .........and make sure you...`
`...come back to me, okay........."`
`"............I'll be waiting,`
` ............always...............`
` ......I planned on helping you out a whole lot more than this,`
` ......but I couldn't do anything.`
` ......Sorry....................."`
`"D‐don't worry about that......!!`
` You......taught me, didn't you......?!`
` You taught me why I have to win...!`
` And that...I absolutely have to win, and come back to you......!!"`
`"What have I.........been doing, lazing about playing in a place like this......?!!`
` Yeah, I'm not playing around here anymore...!!`
` I'm gonna come back, you better believe I'll come back!!`
` I'm definitely gonna come back, bringing a souvenir, I promise......!!!"`
`".........I don't need one,`
` .........so just promise me one thing......"`
`"What is it? I'll promise anything...!!"`
`"......In a second, I'm going to take my hand away......`
` It must have hurt, right......?`
` I held you so tightly...`
` .........Sorry........."`
`".........I'm alright,`
` ......you don't have to turn around, so...`
`.........before I go...`
`...show me you at your...`
`...coolest.........`
` ......Rise from your seat,`
` ......point at the witch before your eyes,`
` ......and declare that the game will recommence........."`
`Ange's hand......slid...`
`......and disappeared behind me.`
`The stark marks of her fingers were left behind in the blood that had been oozing from her fingernails...`
`But I turned around right away.`
`{n}To take care of Ange's wounds...!`
`"Angeeeeeeeee...`
`eeee...ee.........`
`........................`
` ......Ange...?"`
`"Aa~ah, and you even promised that you wouldn't turn around..."`
`"......A‐......Ange.........`
`ah, aahhh, ...wh‐where'd she......"`
`Behind my chair,`
` .........as though......about ten watermelons packed with blood...`
`...had all been smashed,`
` ......there was a sticky, pulpy...`
`...mountain...`
`And around that mountain of blood and minced meat,`
` ......the clothes and shoes Ange had been wearing...`
`...lay crumpled as though they had been thrown off...`
`......As though a human's insides alone had been pulverized and discarded.`
`......As though Ange, who had been standing there until just a second ago, had been crushed.........`
`"Ange......?`
` Wh‐......where is Ange......?`
` Where did Ange disappear to......?`
` H‐hey!`
` Where did Ange disappear to?!"`
`The two young‐looking witches said nothing,`
` .........and just silently looked at the mountain of blood and meat and clothes.`
`But, ......I didn't want to accept it.`
`{n}......I did not want to accept it!!!`
`"..................I was right in front of you.`
` .........Watching the whole time.`
` Watching what happened.........to Ange behind you."`
`"......D‐......do you know......?`
` .........Where did...Ange go.........?"`
`".........While she still lived,`
` pinch by pinch, massive red‐hot pincers...`
`...tore chunks of flesh the size of a thumb off of her,`
` ......and threw them away."`
`".........I was watching.`
` I watched as countless cruel tools, red‐hot from the witch's furnace, approached Ange from behind,`
` and one bit at a time, ......pecked at her flesh, twisted it off, ripped it off in chunks, ......and tore her to pieces."`
`"............Ange should be proud.`
` In order to exchange her last words with her brother,`
` ......she withstood the gasps of pain until the very end...`
` ......She should be proud of that."`
`......Like hell that happened......`
`But......rolling there,`
` ......on top of that mountain of flesh and clothes,`
` ............was, without a doubt, what she had been wearing on her head: those pink‐bead...hair ornaments.`
`To be honest, I was thinking they were a bit too childish and didn't really suit her...`
`......So I remembered them well.`
`...............Why has Ange been wearing these cheap hair ornaments all this time......?`
`No, no,`
` ......this can't be Ange,`
` ......it couldn't be,`
` ......uug...uuuuhhhuuuuuuu...!`
`".....................That was honest, Beato."`
`"Battler didn't see it,`
` so you could've just said that she turned into butterflies and flew away, or something."`
`"......Y‐`
`...you guys also...`
`.........s‐......saw...`
`.........that happen......?"`
`"Y‐`
`......you watched Ange...`
`...get torn into...`
`...little bits...?"`
`"You were watching,`
` .........and yet...`
`...you kept your faces...`
`...that calm.........?!"`
`Without answering, {f:5:Bernkastel}, {f:5:Lambdadelta},`
` and {f:5:Beatrice} looked at me,`
` ......some in pity, ...others in derision.........`
`She was calling herself Gretel,`
` so after what happened with {f:5:Virgilia} in the last game, ......I was thinking up until now that she might be Beato's underling,`
` and I was making sure not to trust her even though she was on my side...`
`And then,`
` .........just as I learn that it was actually Ange,`
` ......I'm not permitted to see her face...`
`.........and when I turn around,`
` ......I find...`
`......something...`
`......like this...`
` ............uuuuuuoohhhhh.........!`
`"What does it matter?`
` .........About your little sister."`
`"......What......did you say............?"`
`"You will never return from this place in any case.`
` .........Whatever happens to your little sister in a world where you don't come home has nothing to do with you."`
`"As long as you play here, the Anges of countless worlds will live in isolation,`
` and the same pain of her final moments just now will be forced upon them, diluted over a period of more than a decade."`
`".........However, that is of no importance, correct?`
` It cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen} by you from here.`
` You cannot observe it.`
` An unobservable truth cannot be proven except by the red truth."`
`"Therefore, your anxiety over Ange's future unhappiness might well be an ungrounded fear.`
` ............She might, surprisingly enough, have an easy life ahead of her, never needing to work, thanks to Rudolf's inheritance, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`......That was...`
`...a lie.`
`From Ange's arm, every part of the sad world that follows had poured into me in an instant.`
`It's all because...`
`......I keep on...`
`......lazing about forever...`
`......and playing in a place like this.........!!`
`......I...`
`never thought about anyone but myself......`
`I have to defeat her!`
` I have to take back my family,`
` ......and come back to Ange who's waiting for me, ......as soon as humanly possible.........!`
`Because even as I hang around with the witch like this,`
` Ange's heart continues to be torn to bits by sadness...!!`
`"............Ange, ......is {i:this}...`
`......what you wanted to see......?"`
`......Towards the cruel witch who had indifferently spoken of Ange's brutal last moments, slowly,`
` ......and yet...`
`...with all my might,`
` ......I pointed......`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice}......"`
`"Mm."`
`"............Resume this game.`
` .........I won't run away anymore, ......and I won't let you get away, either."`
`"As I like it.`
` I can no longer escape or hide.`
` .........Let us settle this between us for certain.`
` .........One will win.`
` One will lose, and be destroyed.`
` No other resolution exists."`
`".........I will win.`
` No matter how long it takes, I will definitely defeat you...!!`
` In this match, there will no longer be any compromise, interruptions or losing by default!!`
` I won't run away!`
` You won't get away!!"`
`"Come take me down, with everything you've got...!!`
` There's no need for any stupid tricks or deceptions, no need for interacting with each other weirdly or acting all friendly!!`
` You and I are enemies...!!!`
` I have to settle this as soon as possible, .........and bring my family back to Ange!!!"`
`......Unwavering purpose.`
` ...Absolute, certain willpower.`
`A {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}'s certain willpower becomes certain magical power.`
`......That acts as a miracle, and makes it a promise.`
`Yes, this is a promised {i:certain miracle}.`
`..................Is there not even a one in ten‐billion chance...{n}`
`no.........is it {i:certain that there is not even a fragment of a miracle}...{n}`
`that could make my victory happen?`
`Before I knew it, a cold, stiff chain had bound my other leg without a sound,`
` fastening me to the chair...`
`............All that is left to me is either to be killed by Battler and be defeated,`
` or resist that, and repeatedly tie for all eternity.`
`......No, I guess that's "repeatedly tie until I prepare my heart for death".`
`Either way.`
`.........I must now fight only to lose.`
`I have already been bound in eternal chains.`
`And Battler won't let me escape either.`
`......Should I pathetically beg for his forgiveness...?`
`Should I ask for compassion by appealing to his pitying heart...?`
`Should I disregard appearances and prostrate myself?`
`Because of the chains, even that will not be granted me.`
`......Checkmate.`
`The perfect endgame.`
`.................................However.`
`I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`The demon lord of gold who reigns over the Golden Land.`
`It may be a losing battle, but still there exists an attitude befitting my stature.`
`And I have the right to beautify my death in a manner fitting for me.`
`".........And I likewise.`
` I will make you accept the existence of my magic, and open the door to the Golden Land on this island.`
` You shall become the guest of honor at the very first tea party."`
`"Everyone besides you has gathered already, you see?`
` Because the arrival of the guest of honor has been delayed, the tea party cannot begin.`
` Your father, mother, cousins, and everyone else are getting tired of waiting for your arrival."`
`"Yeah, suits me, suits me absolutely perfect!!`
` Magic and witches, what a load of bullshit...!!`
` I'm done playing games with you!!`
` Here we go, {f:5:Beatrice}...!!!"`
`"I suggest you hold nothing back, for there will be no compromise, interruptions or losing by default.`
` One will win, and one will be destroyed."`
`"If you have no desire to lose, then you must defeat me, kill me.`
` However, I will not go down without a fight.`
` I can resist repeatedly, until you prepare a fitting end for me."`
`"Are you capable of doing that?`
` ......Yes, I'm sure you can.`
` I know you can.`
` Now...come kill me.`
` ..................`
` .....................Am I making you uncomfortable?`
` Then let's go with something more familiar.`
` ....................."`
`"Hyahhaha!!`
` Like hell I'll be killed,`
` even if I can't win, I can still frustrate the hell out of you by not giving you the victory, rii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}ight?!"`
`"Hoh, that's a good look on your face!`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*,`
` uhhyahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha,`
` aaa{0}kkya{0}kkya{0}kkya{0}kkya{0}kkya!!"`
