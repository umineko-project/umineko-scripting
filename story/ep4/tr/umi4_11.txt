`It was already approaching ten at night.`
`{n}The typhoon had already engulfed Rokkenjima.`
`Even the rose garden that had looked so beautiful during the day...`
`was now being beaten down upon by the fierce winds and resisting with all its might, undulating and trying to keep the flowers from blowing away...`
`Heading for the guesthouse through that rose garden, led by Shannon, were Battler, who was holding up an umbrella; Jessica; and Maria, who was sleeping on George's shoulder.`
`"It's just to the guesthouse, we could make it there on our own...`
` Shannon‐chan, it's OK, go back and rest."`
`"Oh, no, accompanying you is also my duty..."`
`"The family conference is going on inside, and my mom and Genji‐san are on edge, that's the thing.`
` If we're too considerate to her, they'll get the wrong idea and think she's slacking off."`
`"That's right.`
` Just graciously accepting her offer will actually cause her less trouble.`
` ...Thanks, Shannon."`
`"Not at all.`
` ......Certainly, as Milady says, it is very tense inside the mansion today.`
` Coming with all of you has allowed me a breath of fresh air, and taken some of the stress off me."`
`"The family conference, huh.`
` .........They went to all the trouble of chasing us kids out, so they're probably having a pretty damn nasty discussion."`
`"Probably.`
` I'm sure there's nothing we can do to help out.`
` Just making sure to stay out of their way is the best way for us to be useful, I think."`
`"Feh......!`
` You can bet your ass they're just going on about money money money again."`
`"...They act like they're so rich most of the time, but when it comes down to handing out cash, they start hemming and hawing.`
` Why can't they just be generous and split it evenly between everyone?"`
`"Ihihi.`
` That'd be awesome.`
` It'd be great if I got a share too.`
` 'Cause if I got some as well, I'd split it with Shannon‐chan right away."`
`"Th‐thank you very much...`
` That's alright, but I appreciate the offer."`
`"You aren't materialistic at all, are you, Shannon?`
` Normally, girls of your age have plenty of things they want to buy."`
`"Yes.`
` But none of the things I want can be bought with money."`
`"Ooh!`
` So ungreedy!`
` If you lined up all the things I wanted, all the gold in the world wouldn't be enough."`
`"Nothing you can {i:buy}, she said.`
` I wonder what these "things that can't be bought" that Shannon wants a~re.`
` Any idea, George nii‐san?"`
`"W‐well, I wonder.`
` I guess only Shannon would know."`
`"I, ...I don't know either."`
`George and Shannon looked down with their faces red.`
`Battler had also heard the details, so he knew what Jessica was teasing them about.`
`"George‐aniki is someone even I can respect.`
` I think you've met a really great person, Shannon‐chan."`
`"Yeah.`
` I can rest easy knowing Shannon is in good hands."`
`"St‐stop teasing.`
` It's a serious issue for us.`
` More importantly, what about you, Jessica‐chan?`
` Have you been able to get a little closer to Kanon‐kun?"`
`"Whaaaaaaaaat?!`
` So, you and Kanon‐kun are like that?!"`
`"Ah, um, mgh!!`
` Th‐that's dirty, George nii‐san, twisting the conversation around like that is just mean!"`
`As they had an animated discussion with ups and downs,`
` the four kids headed for the guesthouse.......`
`The annual family conference was extremely important to the Ushiromiya family,`
` and this year in particular seemed like it was going to be especially so.`
`Apparently, the family head, Kinzo, was personally going to be making a very serious announcement,`
` and everyone other than the adults had been strictly ordered to leave the mansion.`
`Battler hadn't attended the family conference in six years, so he hadn't really noticed,`
` but according to Jessica, there seemed to be a very tense atmosphere tonight,`
` completely different from a normal year.`
`......Common sense made it clear that Kinzo, whose remaining life was short,`
` was going to make some big announcement about the succession of the head and the distribution of his fortune......`
`"I'm surprised.`
` .........To think that Grandfather is actually going to make an appearance......"`
`"......I see.`
` So this is the witch's counterattack."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` I wanted to leave the Joker called Kinzo face‐down a little longer, but it is probably about time to turn it over.`
` Trump cards exist to be used.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Damn.`
` So my theory that Grandfather was dead since the beginning, and a mysterious 18th person had snuck in in his place...`
`...is now suddenly torn apart."`
`"I had foreseen that you would begin to doubt Kinzo eventually...!`
` Come on, come on, your reasoning is back to square one once again, you know?"`
`"With this, your theory that Kinzo was dead at the very beginning and I was hiding as the 18th person goes poof!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`".........Goddammit...`
` But no way I'll lose heart.`
` That's only one theory gone.`
` I'll attack you like a storm, like a tornado......"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` I would have it no other way!`
` Even the first twilight has not yet begun.`
` It is far too early to give up."`
`"That's right.`
` And it's not like it was denied with the red truth.`
` .........At this point in time, Battler's theory hasn't been defeated.`
` It's too early to say that you've won."`
`"Hmm, you're right.`
` ......It {i:is} still too early for me to simply swallow her story.`
` ...Grandfather is supposed to be finally appearing,`
` but there's also a chance that there'll be a lot of talk about how his health has gotten worse and he won't appear after all."`
`"......Uncle Krauss might simply be trying desperately...`
`to hide the fact that Grandfather really is dead until the last second."`
`"Ha...!`
` I see, I see, you could also think of it that way.`
` Do as you please.`
` It will be resolved soon.`
` Very soon...`
` *cackle*cackle*......!"`
`All of the relatives and Nanjo could be seen in the dining hall.`
`Nanjo sat alone, quietly watching the wind and rain outside.`
`Krauss was sitting in the seat of his own rank, with Natsuhi standing motionlessly at his side.`
`All the other siblings and their partners were gathered at the opposite end of the long table, whispering to each other......`
`"......Is that true?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......Maria said...the person who gave her the umbrella...`
`...was Father."`
`"Son of a gun...`
` Then that means the foundation of our strategy has collapsed...!"`
`"Not just our strategy.`
` Since Father is healthy and has said that he will make an announcement himself, our trivial bargaining with Nii‐san was completely pointless."`
`"Yup.`
` ......That old bastard.`
` Why couldn't he have just shown himself right away instead of dragging it out?`
` Thanks to that, we've just been quarreling with Aniki uselessly."`
`"............Maybe that's what he wanted to test?`
` Maybe it's not my place to say it, since we aren't related by blood, but your father is very intelligent, you realize?"`
`"Our exchange during the day was probably being listened in on by one of the servants, and reported to Father.`
` .........Incredible.`
` The fact that we're clamoring after Father's inheritance is now clear as day to him...`
` .........Ah, just incredible..."`
`Eva held her head, uncharacteristically dejected.`
`If, as Kyrie had said, this had been Kinzo's design from the beginning—`
`a huge setup spread over more than a year in a bid to find the siblings' true natures—`
`then they had fallen for it completely...`
`"......We still don't know for sure that it's reached Father's ears."`
`"No, it definitely has!`
` ......And everyone but Nii‐san claimed that he was dead, and none of us believed in his good health...!"`
`"Aaah, we're done for.......`
` ......He'll make an announcement.`
` He'll say that Nii‐san will become the successor, and that we aren't even qualified to wear the One‐winged Eagle......`
` ......Ahhh, I............"`
`"Nee‐san...... Don't give up......"`
`"......Rosa‐san.`
` I wonder whether Maria‐chan really did receive that umbrella from Father?"`
`"Huh?`
` What do you mean......?"`
`"......{i:Maria‐chan} might have met Father.`
` But {i:we} haven't.`
` Maria‐chan only claims to have met him."`
`"What......?`
` ......Are you saying that Maria is telling a lie?!"`
`"Calm down, Rosa.`
` ......We're not calling Maria‐chan a liar.`
` But she's the kind of kid who accepts what people tell her, right?"`
`"......For example, if, say, Genji‐san came up to her and said something like "I was told by your grandfather to hand this to you, Maria‐sama",`
` then even if Maria‐chan hadn't met Dad, she still might say that she got an umbrella from him, right?"`
`"Th‐......that's right.`
` That could be the trick...!"`
`"But what Maria‐chan said was this, right?`
` "Grandfather came and handed me an umbrella"."`
`"Yes, it was.`
` She was clear that she received the umbrella directly from her grandfather."`
`"......Directly, huh?`
` Well, that's that, then."`
`"...........................`
` Whoever said that the thinking of the incompetent can pass for sleeping was absolutely right.`
` If you think about it a bit, all this about the umbrella is irrelevant."`
`"Why?`
` Maria‐chan could have been bribed by Nii‐san to lie and say something that made it seem like Father was in good health, couldn't she?!`
` There is no evidence that Father actually handed the umbrella to her...!"`
`"No matter who Maria‐chan received the umbrella from,`
` or even if she never was given an umbrella in the first place,`
` Father will appear very soon.`
` With Father in front of us, the question of the umbrella will be completely irrelevant."`
`".........In other words, the only time that the umbrella question comes into play is the other case."`
`"What do you mean, the other case?"`
`"............Ah, ...I got it.`
` ......This is probably what Kyrie‐san's sayin'."`
`".........We're bein' told that Father is comin' here any moment,`
` but there's still a chance of some excuse why he won't turn up in the end, right......?"`
`"I, .........I see.`
` That's true..."`
`"Maybe Nii‐san just said Father was going to appear off the top of his head, in a desperate bid to buy time against our investigation.`
` Father really has passed away already,`
` and Nii‐san is still lying and saying he's in good health...!"`
`"In short, if Father appears, then no schemes will be effective.`
` There's no need to even think about it.`
` We're fish on the chopping board.`
` We'd have no choice but to leave fate to the heavens and face direct negotiations with Father.`
` No choice but to beg for money, in the expectation that we'll need to prostrate ourselves and be subjected to his fists."`
`"......But on the other hand, if Father doesn't appear, then our original strategy isn't hampered in the least."`
`".........I see.`
` Then, no matter which way it goes, there's absolutely no need to get flustered now."`
`"That's it.`
` If Father shows up, it simply means that the family conference will be carried out as normal.`
` .........If he doesn't, we just have to continue to press Krauss nii‐san."`
`"He might start off sayin', Father's mood has suddenly gotten worse and...`
` We gotta make absolutely sure not to let Krauss‐san talk his way out of it."`
`"......It seems what we should really be trying to figure out...`
`is what scheme Nii‐san is going to try to use to buy himself some time.`
` I know better than anyone just how far he'll go to refuse to admit defeat."`
`"If Father is well, ......then we prostrate ourselves and beg for money.`
` ......If it's Krauss nii‐san's farce, then we continue our ugly sibling fight.`
` .........Seems like this year's family conference is going to be as wonderful as ever."`
`"Yep.`
` The thinking of the incompetent can pass for sleeping, then.`
` It's almost ten.`
` ......Should we press Aniki?"`
`Rudolf and the rest looked at Krauss.`
`Firmly seated, he looked like he was awaiting Kinzo's arrival with an air of composure.`
`......They couldn't tell whether that really was composure, or whether he was scheming about how to tie together his lie.`
`"............Dear......"`
`"......Calm yourself.`
` Making a fuss here won't achieve anything.`
` .........Let's leave it to Genji‐san."`
`"It's almost......ten o'clock, isn't it."`
`That was the time that had been set for tonight's family conference to open.`
`And in addition, it was also the time that the Ushiromiya family head needed to appear......`
`Right then, they heard the sound of footsteps approaching from the hall.`
`{n}There were multiple sets.`
`Natsuhi jerked her head up with a start......`
`But there came the sound of a knock, and her expression filled with disappointment.`
`Because Kinzo probably wouldn't have knocked.`
`"......Please excuse us.`
` We have finished closing up the mansion for the night."`
`It was Gohda and Kumasawa.`
`Unlike the physically fit Gohda,`
` it was rare for Kumasawa with her old body to still be tasked with work this late.`
`Of course, Krauss also seemed to know that.`
`"Mmhm.`
` Good work.`
` .........My apologies for making you work at such a time, Kumasawa‐san."`
`"Oh, not at all.`
` I may not look it, but staying up late is still one of my specialties.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho...!"`
`"......Could we not at least relieve Kumasawa of the duty of being an observer?`
` It really will be difficult on her body, I imagine."`
`"............The order was to gather all of the servants as well.`
` I cannot disobey."`
`Tonight's family conference was clearly different from a normal one.`
`On a normal year, no one was able to attend the family conference except relatives.`
`{n}It would have been inconceivable for any servants to be present.`
`But this year was different.`
`They had been told to have all of the servants in attendance for the family conference.`
`{n}Of course, they would not be allowed to speak.`
` .........They were there as observers.`
`Just what in the world was going to happen that needed five servants to observe?`
`......Even Krauss didn't know.`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` Believe it or not, I'm good at pulling all‐nighters.`
` If you stuff yourself with mackerel too, Krauss‐sama, you'll be able to keep going all night as well."`
`"Hahahaha.`
` I see, so there's energy in you yet.`
` No doubt you'll still be working with such energy when you're past a hundred."`
`"Madam.`
` Forgive my presumption, but I have prepared a light snack.`
` It is ready to be served at any time—just give the word."`
`"Thank you.`
` You really are considerate.`
` ......Please ask our guests whether they would care for some more coffee."`
`"Certainly."`
`After bowing slightly, Gohda took the pot towards the relatives gathered at the other end of the table.`
`As he did, more footsteps approached from the hallway.`
`......A single set.`
` They were light.`
`Even before the knock, they could imagine who it was.`
`"Excuse me......`
` I have taken the children to the guesthouse."`
`"Good work.`
` Tonight is a special evening.`
` Make sure you stay alert."`
`"Ye‐yes.`
` Certainly, Madam......"`
`Genji, accompanied by Kanon, had gone to meet Kinzo.`
`{n}......There was still no sign of their return.`
`The hands of the clock were creeping past ten.`
`{n}Once sure of that, Eva spoke to Krauss.`
`"......Nii‐saaan?`
` It's time.`
` Is the family conference still not going to start?"`
`"............The arrival of the guest of honor has been delayed.`
` Wait a short while."`
`"How long?`
` Sorry, but I'm setting a time limit on this.`
` I won't have you saying "Father hasn't quite shown up yet" over and over until dawn."`
`"How can {i:I} make a promise about the time {i:Father} will show up?`
` Why are you in such a rush?`
` Why not drink some coffee and calm down for now...?"`
`"Aniki, we're gathered here for a family conference.`
` Not a farce.`
` We'll wait thirty more minutes.`
` But if that gets us nothing, we're barging into the study."`
`"B‐barging into......`
` That would be an action quite lacking in respect for the head!"`
`"It would, wouldn't it? Sorry about that.`
` We'll sit tight for thirty more minutes.`
` Hehheheheh......"`
`".....................Heh."`
`"...........................`
` I look forward to seeing whether you can keep that same smile thirty minutes from now."`
`"......You honestly believe that Father is dead?"`
`"I have no desire to discuss that at this point.`
` We just have to wait until Father comes here.`
` There's absolutely no need for me to argue you down, Nii‐san."`
`"The Ushiromiya headship will be passed on to the proper person in the proper manner.`
` ......No matter what you may scheme, you cannot go against this.`
` Of course, the same goes for me."`
`"What are you on about?`
` ......You've been bragging all these years about being the successor to the head yourself...!"`
`"Allow me to turn your words straight back on you.`
` I have no desire to discuss that at this point.`
` Father merely has to come here and proclaim it with his own mouth.`
` It is completely unnecessary for me to argue you down.`
` ......Right?`
` Heheheh!"`
`Krauss casually turned Eva's words back on her.`
`{n}Of course, that poured fuel on Eva's anger.`
`{n}But it didn't ignite.`
`Because in that instant, the sound of a very loud knock rang out.`
`Both Genji and Kanon were usually very reserved when they knocked.`
`{n}They wouldn't hit the door with such a violent strength.`
`......It was like a judge's gavel slamming down in a call to order.`
`So everyone fell quiet......`
`The door opened slightly, ......and Genji showed himself.`
`Then, he spoke with a solemn tone different from his usual one.`
`{n}It wasn't the tone he used when carrying out his duties.`
`{n}......It was the tone he used when speaking for Kinzo himself.`
`So just by hearing Genji speak like that, the siblings were struck with a sudden tension.`
`"Take your seats, everyone."`
`At those words, the dining hall fell into complete silence, and everyone rushed back to their designated seats.`
`They were like students who had been making a lot of noise just before homeroom, hurriedly returning to their seats when the teacher came;`
` it might even have felt humorous.`
`......But there was no way anyone would joke about it.`
`Everyone sat in order, and Shannon, Gohda, and Kumasawa stood up straight in a row by the wall.`
`"......The head of the glorious Ushiromiya family, and lord of Rokkenjima, the island that sparkles gold.`
` Lord Ushiromiya Kinzo is present."`
`Of the double doors into the dining hall, Genji opened the right door from the inside, and Kanon opened the left door from the outside.`
`......And, welcomed by the deepest of bows from the two servants, with his cape fluttering majestically, ............Kinzo appeared......`
`Kinzo's gait had a dignified weight to it, and it was very hard to believe that he had been diagnosed as having not much time left to live.`
`Genji pulled back Kinzo's seat, and motioned for him to sit.`
`But Kinzo remained standing, signaling with his chin for Genji to move back.`
`"Hhheheheheheheheh, fuhha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!`
` Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to Rokkenjima.`
` Why the frightened face, Evaa?"`
`"N‐no, why would I be frightened...!`
` I, I'm just relieved to find you in excellent spirits, Father......"`
`"Wahahahaha...!!`
` Evaa, you're as interesting as ever, aren't yoou?`
` You might try honestly saying how frustrated you are at losing your bet with Krauss.`
` ......Heheh{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah, you can't say it, can youuu?`
` Hehuhuha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah!!"`
`Eva realized that their conversation during the day had indeed been an open book to Kinzo, and she turned red as she hung her head.`
`"Well then, my sons, daughters, and their companions!`
` Tonight, I shall make an important announcement regarding those things that you all have your hearts set upon: my fortune and the succession of the headship."`
`"But first!`
` I think I will mention how incredibly disappointed I am.`
` I refer to the fact that, to this very day, not a single one of you has been able to solve the riddle of the epitaph."`
`Even though Kinzo said he was disappointed,`
` a condescending smile, as though there was no way the likes of them could have solved it, rose to his face as he cast an eye over each and every one of them.`
`".........I had been planning on handing over everything to the person who could solve it.`
` But here we stand today, not a single person having been capable, and not a single person having succeeded to all that is mine."`
`"Shameful...!!`
` The fact that not one among you has come forward with the qualifications to succeed me,`
` I find truly disappointing, and shameful, and pathetic!!`
` Wah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"`
`The siblings hung their heads in silence.`
`Of course, they would have solved it if they could.`
` They had blown their chance, and none of them could deny that, but even so, it was just so hard a riddle...`
`"Therefore.`
` I am proclaiming here and now that I will suspend the use of the epitaph's riddle as a method of choosing my successor."`
`"In short, time's up!`
` This is game over.`
` ......What a shame for all of you.`
` You all had an equal and fair chance, and that has now collapsed!`
` .........Mwwhhuhuhahah!!"`
`It truly sounded like Kinzo was making a victory proclamation.`
`"In that case, will the headship be succeeded by my oldest son, Krauss...?`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` The answer is <no>!!"`
`"Wha...?!"`
`"....................."`
`"......I am sure you understand why, Krauss?`
` I certainly did give you the title of successor.`
` But you did nothing with it but get drunk on it...`
` Do you know what it means to be the successor......?"`
`".........It means...to be the one who will succeed you, Father..."`
`"WROOOOOOONNNNNNGGGGG!!`
` The successor isn't something that's guaranteed by the current head at aaaaaall!"`
`".........Listen up, Krauss.`
` I'll only teach you this once, so unplug your ears and listen.`
` The "successor", see,`
` is what you call someone who finds everyone else who's after the headship,`
` thoroughly breaks their noses, and makes it so that they can never disobey him again."`
`"This is not only something that can be said of the headship.`
` It can also be said of money!`
` A "rich person" doesn't mean someone who has money.`
` It means someone who crushes everyone who has more money than himself,`
` and who scrabbles together more money than anyone else."`
`"It's the same with talent.`
` A "genius" is not what you call a person blessed with talent!`
` It means a person who crushes everyone with more talent than themselves!`
` A person who can coerce all other people to call them that by using their strength and charisma!!"`
`"You have a mistaken impression when it comes to all of these things.`
` ......So you aren't of the right caliber to be my successor.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"...............N‐now I have learned..."`
`Perhaps that was precisely Kinzo's philosophy.`
`Though it could also be taken for a rant, it was as a result of faithfully carrying out that philosophy of his...`
`that Kinzo had raised the Ushiromiya family to such prosperous heights......`
`It may be hard to imagine after his immersion in the occult in recent years,`
` but it was that brutal aggressiveness that was Ushiromiya Kinzo's charisma and aura...`
`"Such a weak‐minded person has no qualification to inherit everything of the Ushiromiya family.`
` In that case, is Eva, Rudolf, or Rosa qualified?"`
`"That is also <no>!!`
` You were not able to solve the riddle, and neither were you able to scheme to drag Krauss down from his throne!`
` All the three of you could manage to do was put together a united front to try to extort money from Krauss."`
`"And even that scheme was thoughtless!`
` You can't even corner Krauss all by himself!`
` .........There could be nothing more shameful!"`
`"You lack the avarice to steal away the position of successor by any means necessary!!`
` In order to get what you want, you should pay all sacrifices, be covetous, avaricious to the last...!!`
` Fortune smiles upon the greedy!!"`
`"You three, who lack that wild spirit, are as unfit for the succession as Krauss!!"`
`Eva and the rest had no words to respond with.`
` And they couldn't figure out what it was that Kinzo was about to say...`
`Was Kinzo actually planning to proclaim that no one would succeed the head?`
`If so, that would work to Eva, Rosa, and Rudolf's advantage.`
`Because the only thing the siblings would ultimately need to do is coordinate everything between them after Kinzo's death, and split the inheritance evenly.`
`On the contrary, if a specific person's name was raised and proclaimed to be the one to succeed the head, that would surely be {i:more} troublesome.`
`......But would Kinzo really say something that would benefit any of the four siblings after lambasting them so much?`
`"......You don't think...he's going to say that because no one will succeed him,`
` he'll donate all of his fortune to charity or something, right......?"`
`".........I'm afraid I wouldn't put it past Father."`
`"The blood's just risen to his head......`
` For the time being, we're just gonna have to hear him out."`
`"W‐...well then, Father.`
` What thoughts do you have regarding the next head?"`
`"Hmph.........`
` Since I am so completely disappointed in all of you, I've lost the desire to hand it over to anyone.`
` Therefore, the Ushiromiya family will end here.`
` It ends with my generation."`
`"......S‐surely we must......"`
`"The Ushiromiya family was ruined long ago in that earthquake.`
` The current Ushiromiya family is nothing but my own short‐lived vision of gold.`
` ......The likes of which will end when I awaken from my slumber."`
`"Hehheheh!`
` This world is naught but a dream, an illusion.`
` ...Life is but a daydream before the awakening called death."`
`"Aaah, yes, and so it has been since the beginning!!`
` That I should lose everything when I die was {f:5:Beatrice}'s contract, and her curse!`
` Fuhhahhahha!!`
` You think that will work, {f:5:Beatrice}?!"`
`"I will be the one to capture you!!`
` Tonight, that shall become reality.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"`
`For a while, Kinzo was overcome with cackling, and his eyes bulged.`
`Whenever he talked about {f:5:Beatrice}, he was always eloquent, and filled with obsession......`
`"Foolish sons and daughters such as yourselves were truly a daydream!!`
` It is as though you were never there from the beginning!!"`
`"Disappear! Wake up!!`
` Fade away along with the doze of my true self...!!`
` You failures that have not built up anything that makes you worthy to succeed me!!"`
`"K‐Kinzo‐san.`
` If I may......"`
`"What is it?`
` My friend."`
`Nanjo nervously raised his hand, asking to speak.`
`{n}Kinzo permitted it.`
`"I understand how you feel, Kinzo‐san.`
` Because you love your children,`
` you expect a lot of them, and as a parent and grandparent myself,`
` I understand the parental affection that can make you feel as though these expectations were betrayed."`
`"......However, you are extraordinary, Kinzo‐san.`
` A genius.`
` Isn't it a little too harsh to say that it's only natural for them to catch up to you...?"`
`"And even so, that has not stopped them from trying—`
`Krauss‐san, Eva‐san, Rudolf‐san, Rosa‐san, and all of their partners, are doing their very best to catch up..."`
`"Hohoooooooooohhh???`
` And just how much money have they built up with this "doing their very best"?`
` These half‐wits, who fail in each and every one of their enterprises and become burdened with debt,`
` and still try to sponge off me, are "doing their very best" exactly howwww...?!?!"`
`"Money is the crystallization of everything in this world.`
` If you cannot grasp that, then you cannot grasp the world!`
` If a soul cannot keep a tight grasp on this world, it doesn't deserve to live!!`
` Disappear!!`
` Begone from my life and reality!!"`
`"......That argument is unreasonable.`
` With that logic, even I would not be allowed to live."`
`"......And yet I believe the time I spent playing chess with you was worthwhile for both of us...`
` ......You should know better than anyone else that there are many things in this world that money cannot buy."`
`".........mgh.`
` ......Hmm."`
`As the siblings motionlessly hung their heads, they cheered Nanjo on inside their hearts.`
`Not one of the siblings could offer their opinion to Kinzo in a rage, but Nanjo alone was allowed to, as Kinzo's close friend...`
`Even though Kinzo had raged so fiercely, after being admonished by Nanjo, he nodded several times as though in agreement.`
`......His surprisingly docile side might have seemed cute, but there was no one who could laugh.`
`"It may be true that your children weren't able to build up as great a fortune as yourself.`
` ......Well, even so, from my point of view, they're rich enough to make me jealous."`
`"But besides money, they have also built up a great many things that money can't buy.`
` When it comes to that, they are in no way inferior to you."`
`"Hoh.`
` And what are you saying they have built up that money cannot buy?"`
`"Happiness.`
` Family.`
` ......They have found wonderful partners, had children, and built up their own happy homes.`
` Your family is thriving thanks to them, and they have brought back grandchildren for you."`
`"Grandchildren are good.`
` We older people can look at those young grandchildren, who will live on into a new era that we will not be given a chance to see, and we can imagine endless futures for them.`
` ......Isn't that the sole entertainment for old age?"`
`"Remember, Kinzo‐san.`
` Remember your joy when they first came back to you with grandchildren...!`
` Your children, and your grandchildren, will relate your great works to future generations, and they will model themselves after you.`
` That is something that a single person cannot accomplish no matter how much money they have."`
`The siblings all nodded in agreement...`
`Certainly, there had been a time when Kinzo had looked at his newly born grandchildren with happiness in his eyes.`
`......Back when he still had some sanity in his heart.`
`......However, was there any {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} warmth still left inside Kinzo's heart......?`
`"You mean to say.`
` That in exchange for the vast riches I created!`
` Instead of gaining money, I have gained my grandchildren."`
`"N‐no, no, that's not what I—"`
`"So, in exchange for the several tens of billions in wealth that I have amassed, I have gained a single grandchild from each of my children!!"`
`"Hahhahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` This is wonderful!`
` So, I have created a single life at a cost of ten billion yen!`
` That's how it is!`
` Interesting, thinking of it from the perspective of alchemy truly makes for an interesting analogy, don't you agree...?!"`
`"Hohhh, what valuable grandchildren!`
` Wonderful, ......wonderful!!`
` Wah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!`
` Is that right, Krauss?`
` ......Is your daughter worth ten billion......?"`
`"..........................."`
`Krauss couldn't answer instantly.`
` ......It wasn't that he didn't have confidence in his daughter; it was because he didn't have a clue what Kinzo was trying to test with this question.`
`But when Natsuhi was then pressed for an answer, she responded, breaking Krauss's silence with an answer of her own interpretation.`
`"......Y‐yes.`
` Jessica is a daughter who I wouldn't let go of even for ten billion yen.`
` In that sense, I believe she has a value that can't be counted with money."`
`"Hoh.`
` So you can state for certain that she is worth ten billion.`
` Hohoh!`
` What about you, Eva?`
` What do you say about your George......?"`
`Given the way Natsuhi had chosen to answer, there was naturally no doubt as to what Eva's answer would be.`
`......Even though Eva should have known better than to respond to this kind of provocative question, she did so as well.`
`"Yes, Father.`
` George is worth ten billion, ......no, even more than that."`
`"And that's not in the abstract sense of things money can't buy.`
` George will certainly build up a fortune equal to his worth.`
` I am sure he will become a grandson worthy of carrying on your great works...!"`
`Eva sent a glance at Hideyoshi and Natsuhi that said "Like a fiddle".`
`......After hearing Eva's answer, Natsuhi was about to add more praise for her daughter, but stopped at a glare from Krauss.`
`"Hmm, I see.`
` .........Then what about you, Rudolf?`
` What about your Battler?"`
`"Compared to George‐kun, ......there's nothing about Battler I can brag about.`
` If he was kidnapped and we were threatened with a ransom of ten billion, I'd feel like sticking a bow on the guy and letting them have him."`
`"*giggle*giggle*......"`
`"On top of that, he's an idiot and reckless.`
` He dreams way too big and talks about things he hasn't got a snowball's hope in hell of doing.`
` ......I guess in that respect, he's a super idiot worth the equivalent of ten billion normal idiots."`
`"But you look at the average person who hasn't even got the balls to be an idiot, and I'll bet that guy is gonna try things that ten billion of them couldn't do put together.`
` Well, I'm pretty sure he'll fall flat on his face.`
` The world isn't easy."`
`"......But at the very least,`
` there's no doubt in my mind that watching over his life will be more entertaining than looking at ten billion average people."`
`Eva clicked her tongue at the clever style of speech that would probably match Kinzo's tastes.`
`Apparently Rudolf had been after this himself—he grinned back at her.`
`"......What of Maria?"`
`"M‐......Maria is my darling only daughter.`
` Her value cannot be measured with money.`
` ......That is all."`
`"Hmm.`
` ............I see.`
` Dreams and the future, miracles and possibilities are the source of my magical power.`
` No magic holds power without hope."`
`"......Hmph, I cannot expect anything more from you people who have proven yourselves to be average, but...`
`yes, my grandchildren do have future possibilities, and it is possible that they may be worth hoping for a magical miracle from."`
`"If you say that this makes them worth more than ten billion, hmm, I could understand that.`
` ......Hmmm, hmmmm......"`
`When Kinzo got in a rage, he wouldn't let anyone talk back,`
` but even so, while yelling by himself, he would sometimes convince himself of something all of his own accord, and change his own opinion.`
`......That's what this felt like to the siblings.`
`Apparently, even though Kinzo had become absolutely fed up with his shoddy children and had cast them away as being unfit for the inheritance of his title or his fortune,`
` he wasn't so sure about his grandchildren.`
`......At this rate, he might soon say that the inheritance would go to his grandchildren instead of the siblings.`
`As the siblings sat in fear of what their fickle and short‐tempered father would suddenly think of next,`
` they carefully watched his every move...`
`"......Hmm.`
` ......Let me change my thinking a little.`
` I have absolutely no desire to see you people inherit all that is mine."`
`"However, it would be quite interesting to question the grandchildren to see whether one of them is qualified......`
` I've been thinking of them as kids who never grow up,`
` but there is a chance they will show me a glimmer of unpolished brilliance that will surprise me."`
`"And testing them for that would be...`
`...yes, that would be hard to pass over as a final diversion for my last remaining days.`
` ......Hmmmmm,`
` ......well then, what shall I do..."`
`"I, ...I can recommend George with confidence as a fitting successor for you, Father!"`
`Eva claimed that right away.`
`Natsuhi looked like she was about to follow along, but Krauss gave her a look telling her to restrain herself, so she swallowed her words.`
`"Hehheheheheheh!`
` How bold.`
` ......Then, let us do this.`
` I will individually question the grandchildren to see whether they are qualified to inherit the Ushiromiya family headship and all of its wealth."`
`"...Father—"`
`"Howeeever!!`
` .........I do not mean by this that one of you will receive the headship indirectly.`
` I have already lost hope in every one of you."`
`"I have nothing to give you now.`
` Nothing!`
` The ones I will question are the grandchildren.`
` And the ones who might succeed me are the grandchildren.`
` ......Make absolutely sure that you do not mistake this, are we clear......?"`
`".........I'll follow your decision, Father."`
`"Same here.`
` I'll go along with what you determine.`
` ......And you, Aneki?"`
`"O‐of course.`
` ......I believe that you will make a wise judgment, Father."`
`"I, I will also abide by your decision......"`
`"I shall think of how I will test the grandchildren.`
` And that no longer has anything to do with any of you.`
` Because you no longer have anything to do with the succession of the head."`
`"......So why don't I use this opportunity to talk about something else that does have something to do with you."`
`"Something else......?"`
`"Mm.`
` That is the true reason for tonight's...{i:final} Ushiromiya family conference."`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` What I demand from you is neither a discussion nor your opinions.`
` I demand cooperation.`
` For my ritual!"`
`"............Rituuaaal...?"`
`"Quiet...!`
` Father is talking now...!"`
`Rudolf and the rest automatically knitted their brows at the occult‐like word "ritual".`
`Was he talking about starting a strange ritual involving {f:5:Beatrice}'s resurrection again......?`
`He was demanding that they help...?`
`{n}What in the world was he planning to start?`
`In the past, he had carried out many eccentricities that he called by the same name, such as lighting a strange incense and filling the whole mansion with the stench.`
`To the siblings, a "ritual" was nothing more than one of the aged Kinzo's obnoxious hobbies.`
`"Father...`
` Just what do you mean by.........?"`
`"We'll assist you in any way that we can.`
` Right, Rosa?"`
`"Y‐yes......`
` But...what in the world...is it...?"`
`"The ritual as I inscribed it in the epitaph.`
` ......It is a ritual to revive {f:5:Beatrice}, and open the door to the Golden Land."`
`"That witch, who escaped her cage of flesh and sneeringly slipped through my fingers, I will finally be able to capture,`
` and subjugate, with my greatest hidden art.`
` .........Only, I must sacrifice thirteen people for that purpose."`
`"......Hehheheheheh!`
` It is not easy to gather thirteen sacrifices.`
` But tonight is the family conference!`
` Look how many have gathered on Rokkenjima.`
` There could be no other day on which to carry out this ritual."`
`Taken literally, it could only sound as though he was telling them to die as sacrifices for his disturbing ritual.`
`Ridiculous.`
` Was this some kind of metaphor...?`
`But they didn't even have a clue what he was trying to tell them through this analogy.`
`The siblings whispered together, wondering what Kinzo was saying......`
`"......What's Dad going on about?`
` Is it his usual bad sickness...?"`
`"Probably.`
` Keep quiet for now and hear him out."`
`"..........................."`
`"I'm sorry, Father...`
` I don't understand how you mean that."`
`"What is it you don't understand?`
` I am speaking extremely simply.`
` I have said that I shall choose thirteen people from among the humans on this island and offer them as sacrifices for my ritual to revive {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"Even worthless people like you can be very useful as sacrifices for my ritual.`
` Wa‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"`
`"......Hear this!!`
` This is not a joke nor anything of the sort.`
` This is my final bet, my final ritual, the last I will desire in my life!"`
`"There are now more than thirteen humans on this island.`
` In short, that's a head count which can easily satisfy this massive number of sacrifices!`
` Become the sacrifices for my ritual!!"`
`"......Kinzo‐san, ......you weren't...possibly......`
`serious about what you said back then...?!`
` It wasn't a joke......?!!"`
`Unusually for Nanjo, his face changed color and he stood up and shouted.`
`It seemed this wasn't the first time Nanjo had heard all this dark talk about thirteen sacrifices.`
`"Sorry, my friend.`
` That was not a joke nor anything of the sort.`
` It is what I bet my life on, the final ritual, the final game that I will challenge."`
`"Yes, this is a game!`
` If gaining my fortune and leaving the island is your goal, then there are only two ways to achieve it!"`
`"Successfully survive being chosen as one of the thirteen sacrifices, and stop the ritual by finally solving the riddle of the epitaph,`
` ......or kill me!`
` And stop the ritual in that manner.`
` Those are the only two ways!!"`
`By now, it was no longer whispering among those gathered there, but uneasy commotion.`
`Even the siblings had noticed that Kinzo was beginning to act abnormally...`
`"......Father, are you a little tired?`
` Genji‐san, has Father been drinking at all?"`
`"...............No.`
` The Master is quite lucid."`
`"Sorry, Dad,`
` but I don't have a clue what you've started going on about......"`
`"You're free to start up whatever weird ritual you want to revive the witch you love.`
` That's your hobby, after all.`
` But dragging me into all that, and making me into......hahaha, a sacrifice, is just not gonna happen."`
`"Rudolf, who asked you to chip in?!"`
`"What are you talking about, Aneki?!`
` You think I'm gonna sit here nodding my head at this, are you nuts?!"`
`Was the "ritual" Kinzo had mentioned literally the frightening thing it seemed to be,`
` or was it some kind of test to choose his successor?`
`It seemed that Rudolf had taken it at its disturbing face value,`
` but Eva apparently still believed that it was something like a trial, or examination,`
` to find the proper next head.`
`But Kinzo's response to this was clear.`
`"Well, that is all I have to say.`
` Nooo objections or viewpoints are necessary...!!"`
`"I will simply awaken from my dream in which I have four failures for children.`
` To all of you, what will occur now before your very eyes will no doubt seem like a dream, an illusion, an unearthly world that defies understanding."`
`"But that itself is my reality!!`
` Now, I will finally awaken from the fleeting and useless dream that all of you are!!"`
`"Come, the game has already begun!`
` With this many of you here, I hardly know whose life I should take first...!!"`
`"Good‐bye, my bungling sons and daughters.`
` And for the final and only time in your lives, be of use to me, for my ritual...!!`
` Arise, Pendragon Memorial Troops...!!"`
`As Kinzo raised his arms high like an opera singer, and yelled those words as though towards a packed audience...`
`...the air shattered like glass, .........and the figures of three people who hadn't been invited to this island appeared regardless......`
`"Chiester{ruby:forty‐five:45}, right here...!"`
`"Chiester{ruby:four‐one‐zero:410}, right heere!"`
`"Chiester{ruby:double‐oh:00}, right here, sir."`
`Three girls with bizarre forms suddenly appeared behind Kinzo.`
`Where from?`
` When?`
` Who?`
` Who are they??`
`......The {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s were thrown off balance and their minds went blank.`
`{n}And because they wasted time with such thoughts, they lost their last chance to survive.`
`"I grant you permission to shoot six people to death.`
` You have free choice of targets.`
` Begin attacking."`
`"Unrestricted firing understood, sir.`
` Thank you for the good targets.`
` All units, commence unrestricted firing."`
`"Nihi!`
` First one in nyeh!!`
` Hyahhah!!"`
`As 410 scratched the air with her finger, a golden bow appeared in empty space, and its string was pulled back.`
`The golden arrow that had been readied there was fired off without any hesitation, flew around the room leaving haphazard gold trails everywhere,`
` .........and from among those sitting at the table of the family conference, it chose Natsuhi, and pulverized the left half of her face.`
`Flesh and deep‐red blood splattered all around,`
` leaving a massive amount of deep‐red spatter marks on the relatives' faces and the pure white tablecloth.`
`......There was silence.`
`Despite the massive number of deep‐red blotches left on the tablecloth, even still,`
` .........no one could understand why Natsuhi's head was half smashed, nor why she was hanging her head as though she had dozed off in her chair,`
` .........and they watched these events in silence.`
`......Those sitting on the right‐hand side from Natsuhi were silent for a relatively long time,`
` but those sitting on her left were not.`
`......Because the people sitting on that side...`
`had been shown how her head had been smashed open like a watermelon or a pomegranate, and could even see inside her......`
`"Na......tsuhi............"`
`"......That's one.`
` Natsuhi, I see. A luckless woman to the end.`
` ......Next!"`
`"00, firing."`
`In the same way, 00 scratched the empty air to ready her bow, and fired.`
`Just like the golden arrow 410 had released, it flew around and around at high speeds, drawing a convoluted trail, after which,`
` ......as he looked at Natsuhi in shock, it smashed half of Rudolf's head in the same way, killing him instantly.`
`This time, everyone did not stop thinking altogether.`
` They realized that a terrible murder had been carried out right in front of them according to Kinzo's words.`
`And they understood that Kinzo would probably kill again......!`
`""Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!""`
`""Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!""`
`Shrill screams burst out.`
`Even now, they still didn't know what to do.`
`{n}So they could only keep screaming and flapping their wide‐open mouths like goldfish......`
`"F‐......Father......`
`what do you think you're doing......?"`
`"...Y‐you dolt!!`
` Hurry up and run!!"`
`As Eva asked Kinzo that in total shock,`
` Hideyoshi, who had come to his senses and risen from his chair faster than anyone else, pulled at her arm from behind.`
`However, merciless fate's choice for the third sacrifice...`
`......was Hideyoshi.`
`Just like the two before him, half of Hideyoshi's head was neatly smashed,`
` ......and the right side of his head, which happened to be facing that direction at the time, ......was blown away, chunks of its contents thrown everywhere like a watermelon or a pomegranate.`
`So, still holding Eva, ......Hideyoshi toppled backwards and fell down.`
`Still held by her beloved husband, Eva fell over backwards with him.`
`"Honey......?`
` Honey...?!`
` HiiiIiiIIiiiIIIIIII!!!"`
`Eva screamed.`
`...And who could blame her.`
`The face she had been looking for......had been half lost,`
` and the crushed skull, the squelchy exposed brain, and the crushed jaw were all bare......`
`"45, impact, on target...!"`
`"Spectacular.`
` Fire again.`
` Three remain."`
`"F‐Father...!!`
` W‐w‐w‐w‐w‐what, what...are you doing?!?!"`
`Krauss stood up forcefully, and was about to rush Kinzo, when 00 blocked him.`
`......Despite her slender‐looking body, she held back Krauss's body with just the palm of her right hand.`
`He still tried to resist and attack Kinzo,`
` so 00 lifted Krauss up by the collar, and twisted into his Adam's apple with her thumb.`
`It seemed to be very painful, and Krauss was overcome with agony.`
`"Gghh...oooooooohhhh......!!!`
` Everyone, ...run...!!`
` Get the police......!`
` Emergency services...!!`
` Quickly......!!"`
`"Everyone, let's escape!!`
` Escape!!"`
`Nanjo's sharp words finally broke the spell that had been holding them down in their chairs.`
`As Gohda and Kumasawa made a mad scramble to escape from the dining hall...`
`...410 teleported to that spot, blocking the way.`
`"Nihi! You sure are slow nye~h.`
` Did you think I'd let you escape nye~h{p:0:♪}"`
`"Hiieeeeeeeeeehhhh!!"`
`"H‐help meeeeeeeeeeeee!!"`
`"Gohda‐san, duck!!"`
`At the sound of Kyrie's sharp voice, Gohda, in a state of complete confusion, ducked.`
`......Then, a burst of air rushed above his head.`
`Kyrie had taken a big swing with a chair to mow 410 down.`
`But 410, still wearing a contemptuous expression, easily caught that widely swung chair with one hand.`
`"......Tch!"`
`"You're a scary woman nyeh.`
` You really wanna follow your husband that baaaaad?"`
`From the sleeve of the arm that she had used to catch the chair, something like a shining golden snake appeared,`
` ......coiled itself around the chair, and with a huge CRUNCH!! burst it into splinters.`
`It was a fearsome power, far stronger than any vice.`
`When Kyrie realized that the being in front of her, which looked like a girl,`
` was actually a being that surpassed human knowledge and which a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} could not even begin to oppose,`
` her head was filled with a great alarm bell that welled up from inside her...`
`Even with a scene like this before their eyes, Genji, Shannon, and Kanon, the servants permitted to wear the One‐winged Eagle, continued to stand calmly at attention by the wall,`
` making them look very bizarre and eerie.`
`For an instant, Kyrie thought that the source of their calmness...`
`was that they were with the enemy, and had been guaranteed that they wouldn't be killed.`
`......But no sooner had she thought that than the side of Genji's face was blown away before her eyes.`
`"G‐Genji‐san......"`
`"45, impact, on target...!"`
`"......Hohoh, Genji, now that is unfortunate.`
` ......Rest in peace, my friend.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*, your death will not be wasted.`
` You will become one of the thirteen keys essential to the resurrection of my beloved witch.`
` Fuhha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha......"`
`The half of Genji's expression that remained...`
`...was as indifferent as ever.`
`He tilted, ......fell in a heap, and sent a blood‐red splatter out across the floor......`
`".........Genji‐sama..............."`
`"............We're nothing more...than the witch's pieces.`
` .........Nothing more............nothing more......"`
`From the meek, ...and frustrated...`
`no, ......resigned expressions on Shannon and Kanon's faces, you couldn't feel any naive expectation that they would be saved.`
`That's right.`
` Kinzo was, in the truest sense, .........carrying out these murders at random.`
`In the truest sense, ......he was killing like it was a game to see who would be saved and who would be killed.`
`"Wellll then, whoo'll we go for next nye~h.`
` Nihhihi!!"`
`410 looked at Kyrie for a second.`
`{n}In that second, ......Kyrie prepared for her own death.`
`But once she had readied her golden bow in midair, 410 looked at someone else over Kyrie's shoulder.`
`......So, as shameless as it was, Kyrie sensed that she had been saved......`
`Again, an ugly sound of something cracking and exploding rang throughout the room.`
`......Who was it this time?`
`When Kyrie turned in the direction of the sound...`
`.........she saw Eva collapse onto her husband's chest, gushing blood like a fountain.`
`...Of course, her face was half smashed just like her husband's......`
`410 had mercilessly targeted Eva as she clung to her husband's body, sobbing.`
`"L‐let go of Nii‐san...!!`
` Let go of Nii‐san...!!`
` Just stop it, Father!!`
` Just stop this brutality!!"`
`"......Run, Rosa......`
` Ggh, ghhk, .........!"`
`Rosa's protestations weren't reaching Kinzo as he continued to laugh loudly in the blood‐spattered dining hall,`
` and nor was she able to lessen Krauss's pain as 00 lifted him up by the collar.`
`So Rosa had no choice but to use force.`
` She raised one of the chairs beside her over her head, and gave a warning.`
`"Father...!!`
` Order her to let go of Nii‐san!`
` Just make them stop all this!!"`
`"I think not.`
` If that is what you desire, then prevent it using your own power.`
` ......Cut a path open for your own fate with your own hands.`
` You who have always hid behind the backs of others in fear, show me the final bit of self‐mastery that dwells within you...!!`
` Fuhha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!!"`
`"F‐......Father......`
` .........UWAAA{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}Aa{0}A{0}Aa{0}AHHHH!!!"`
`The chair that Rosa had lifted up...`
`......swung down at the father who had reigned as a symbol of terror for her entire life.`
`It was the greatest, and final, act of bravery and self‐mastery in Rosa's life.`
`Kinzo might have been right.`
`......If she had grasped that courage much, much sooner,`
` her life might have been more free, unrestrained by anyone else.`
`Then, a loud bursting sound.`
`......The sound of Rosa's chair fiercely hitting Kinzo,`
` ...it was not.`
`Still lifting up the chair,`
` .........she neatly lost half of her head, and fell with a thud.`
`While still holding Krauss up with one hand, ......00 had stuck her other hand out towards Rosa.`
`The golden snake released from that arm...`
`had constricted Rosa in a helix,`
` ......and chewed a hole through her head.`
`"......Defensive firing.`
` I apologize for the discourtesy of a point‐blank shot, sir."`
`"It matters not.`
` Hmm, so this makes six?"`
`"Yes, Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}, sir.`
` This makes six."`
`After declaring this with indifference, 00 let go of Krauss, who she had been lifting up this whole time.`
`"Hmmm.`
` So, the sacrifices of the first twilight were Eva, Rudolf, Rosa, Natsuhi, Hideyoshi, and Genji.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`It was a massacre that happened in an instant.`
`The interior of the dining hall was dirtied with blood spatter,`
` ......and the six unlucky victims lay with their heads brutally exposed.`
`Fittingly, it was Kinzo's abnormal laugh alone that echoed in that abnormal space......`
`"Hahhahahahahaha, wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!`
` The curtain has finally risen!`
` It's the beginning of the ritual to revive {f:5:Beatrice}...!!"`
`"You lucky ones who have managed to escape the first twilight, allow me to introduce you to my friends.`
` Arise, my friend!`
` Ronove...!!"`
`When Kinzo called Ronove's name, the demon butler appeared out of thin air, bowing deeply and respectfully......`
`"It is a pleasure to meet you all.`
` And to those of you for whom this is a long‐overdue reunion, good day.`
` Pu ku ku ku...!`
` It seems that we once again have a spectacular mess on our hands."`
`"I care not.`
` This level of stimulus is necessary to wake me from my days of waking dreams.`
` Allow me to introduce you. My friend, reliable butler, and one of the 72 Great Demons, Ronove."`
`"I am pleased to make your acquaintance."`
`Just who was he aiming that introduction at?`
`......Krauss and Kyrie, who were still down on their backsides, and Nanjo, and Gohda, and Kumasawa...`
`could only look up in shock at this middle‐aged gentleman who they had never met before......`
`Only Shannon and Kanon seemed to recognize him, and they bowed deeply...`
`"......I see that I was unable to greet Genji.`
` I hope that he was at least able to complete his duty painlessly."`
`"It was an instant death from a direct hit to the head...!`
` He didn't have the time to feel the pain."`
`"Is that so?`
` Very good."`
`"Allow me to introduce another of my friends.`
` Arise, my friend, {f:5:Virgilia}...!!"`
`Once again, the figure of someone unknown to the relatives appeared out of thin air.`
`{n}She appeared in an elegant dress while greeting them gracefully.`
`".........I thank you for summoning me, my lord.`
` Although I would rather not have been summoned into a sanguinary place such as this."`
`"Allow me to introduce her too.`
` This is my friend and reliable counselor both, {f:5:Virgilia}.`
` ......I want to borrow your power as a great Finite Witch for my ritual.`
` Lend me that power!"`
`"......As someone under your powerful summoning subordination, I would not be permitted to refuse even if I tried.`
` As you wish, my lord."`
`"............He is a fearsome fellow.`
` To think that he summoned three of the Chiester Sisters Corps, and then me, and even {f:5:Virgilia}‐sama..."`
`"......Even though it is only in the area of summoning, to think that he far surpasses Milady is......frightening.`
` The Ushiromiya blood makes my own run cold."`
`"I will be putting all I have as a summoner into the execution of {f:5:Beatrice}'s resurrection ritual.`
` It's still not enough.`
` In order to perfectly succeed in the ritual this time, I shall summon more."`
`"The Pendragon Memorial Troops, Ronove, and {f:5:Virgilia}...`
` ......I can still call more... With my magical power, I can still call many more......!!"`
`"Answer to my summons......`
`one of the 72 demons, Gaap!!"`
`"Gaap...?`
` You can even summon her......?"`
`"It probably means that the corrosion has advanced even more on this island.`
` ......It's enough to enable us to manifest.`
` It would surely not be a surprise to see him summon any kind of great demon at this stage."`
`"Then Rokkenjima has already been completely sucked into a parallel world?`
` ............I hope he doesn't surrender."`
`".........You gave him a good deal of hints the last time, did you not?`
` After all this time, he won't surrender over this much.`
` Probably, I should say."`
`"Pu ku ku!`
` .........Well then, I suggest we enjoy the action unfolding on the stage.`
` It seems the main character is the Master this time.`
` Let us look forward to a script of a different flavor than Milady's."`
`As Kinzo strongly concentrated his magical power, ......a pale blue light gathered in the air, twisted,`
` ......and a magic circle began to be drawn with a deep‐red light.`
`Then it shattered with a sound like glass, .........and a new demon could be seen there.`
`"......I am glad to see that you answered my call.`
` ......Gaap, one of the 72 Great Demons...!"`
`"............This is a hell of a place I've been summoned into.`
` Did you call me to clean up this blood‐stained room?`
` {f:5:Goldsmith}...?"`
`The literally devilish woman, wrapped in a gaudy, ominous costume,`
` looked at the horrifying scene which should have made her cover her eyes, ...and her mouth twisted into a grin......`
`"If that had been the only reason for calling you,`
` it would be like using a cashmere scarf to mop the floor."`
`"It's been a long time, Gaap.`
` ......To think that a Great Demon such as yourself has finally appeared on this island.`
` ......I wonder if this island has nearly sunk into fantasy."`
`"This all‐star cast is more astonishing than the gruesome state of the room.`
` .........A full three Chiester Sisters, the Great Demon Ronove, the Great Witch {f:5:Virgilia}, and even me."`
`"What's going on?`
` Is this Pandemonium?`
` Are you trying to start a concert from hell or something?`
` .........Yes, as a conductor for that, I can't imagine anyone other than you, {f:5:Goldsmith}."`
`"I will have your assistance as facilitator in the completion of my ritual to resurrect {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` You have no objections to my summoning contract, I assume...?"`
`"Objections?`
` There's no way {i:I} could fight the summoning subordination of the legendary Great Summoner, Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}, who enslaved the famous Great Witch {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......I'll assist you.`
` Although I will of course charge a fitting price.`
` ......So?`
` What's my first job?"`
`"Capture the simpletons who made it through the first twilight.`
` Fortunately, there are still seven here, aren't there?`
` Nanjo, Shannon, Kanon, Gohda, Kumasawa, Kyrie, and Krauss...!"`
`"Hoh, if these seven are all offered as sacrifices, that's exactly thirteen people!`
` Until it is time for the second and later twilights to be carried out, throw them into the cage of sacrifices, gehehehah!!"`
`"............A cashmere mop, I see.`
` Understood."`
`As Gaap shrugged her shoulders, she looked at Krauss, who was still down on his butt.`
`She glared.`
`Then, she snapped her fingers, ......and Krauss was swallowed up by the floor, as though a round pitfall had opened up there.`
`"Uu...waarg........."`
`"One down."`
`There was no hole in the floor.`
` But it had certainly looked as though Krauss had been swallowed up by a hole and disappeared......`
`"............!!"`
`Searching for her next prey, Gaap's gaze crossed Kyrie's.`
`{n}She snapped her fingers.`
`Kyrie jumped back as though repelled.`
`Her instinct was correct.`
` Because, in the place where she had been until a second ago, a round, jet‐black hole had appeared, the same kind that had swallowed up Krauss.`
`However, before she could catch her balance, another pitfall appeared and swallowed her up.`
`......Even Kyrie had no way of eluding Gaap's capture.`
`"Uwaahhhhh......!!"`
`Snap went her fingers once again, and a shocked Nanjo disappeared into the floor.`
`Another snap of the fingers,`
` and 410 let out a short yelp and jumped back.`
`This time, a slightly larger pitfall had opened, taking in both Shannon and Kanon, who had been standing in a line by the door.`
`But because 410 had jumped away from the door, the way was no longer blocked.`
`Instinctively aware that they would be next, Gohda dashed out through that door.`
`Of course, Kumasawa too was hot on his heels, and ran off at lightning speed.`
`As Gaap snapped her fingers over and over,`
` round, jet‐black pitfalls opened one after another behind them, chasing them.`
`However, they did nothing but drive the desperately fleeing pair forward, and couldn't swallow them up.`
`Gohda and Kumasawa escaped in a matter of seconds......`
`".........I've dulled.`
` I let two get away."`
`"Worry not, we are currently locking onto the fleeing targets."`
`"Data link ready.`
` Nihi!`
` Shall we snipe?"`
`"No, I cannot authorize that.`
` They are precious sacrifices.`
` Wait for the Master's authorization."`
`"Great Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}...!`
` We await your orders...!"`
`"It is still too soon for the coming of the second twilight, ......is what the source of my magical power is whispering to me.`
` Not now.`
` Let them do as they like.`
` They cannot escape from this island in any case."`
`"The source of your magical power is noise and risk and tests of luck.`
` ......Hoh‐hoh‐ho, your whims, in other words?"`
`"Hhhhehhehheh, perhaps you could also put it that way.`
` Good work, Gaap.`
` Let us proceed steadily with the ritual from here on."`
`".........Well then, that is that.`
` Next is my grandchildren.`
` .........I will test them to see whether they are qualified to succeed me.`
` Let me see, how best to check their qualifications.`
` Kuheheheh...!!"`
`"If you determine that they are qualified,`
` ......do you intend to abandon Beato's resurrection?"`
`"Of course.`
` Yet still I will test them.`
` ......Hmph, I doubt a woman can understand that contradiction, or my madness.`
` Khhhahahahah..."`
`".........There's always something not quite right about men.`
` The very concept of playing with risk is beyond me."`
`"Oh, and here I thought you loved that sort of thing?"`
`"Of course.`
` If a man whispers intimacies in my ear along with dangerous risk, I go head over heels.`
` ...But only if he's a stud!"`
`"Pu ku ku ku ku ku...!"`
`"Quiet, please.`
` No talking among yourselves."`
`"Hmph, truly noisy women.`
` But at least they don't bore me.`
` ......This is why summoning is so gratifying.`
` All of you will bear one side of the scales of noise and risk in my ritual.`
` I am anticipating great results...!"`
`Six brutally murdered corpses lay in the dining hall, which was tarnished by a red and gruesome decoration......`
`By now, it was impossible to imagine that thirteen people had been sitting here in an orderly manner just moments ago.`
`Kinzo lined up the demons of renown and their subordinates, loudly declared the beginning of an overwhelming night of mass murder,`
` and swore to himself that he would certainly revive {f:5:Beatrice}, and open the door to the Golden Land......`
`"The wait is over!!`
` At last the curtain rises on the first twilight!!`
` *cackle*!`
` That Kinzo, as usual, he loves being flashy.`
` Who knew that this man, who can be more persistent than anything when he follows you around, could shine so when placed on the stage."`
`"Dammit......`
` Always killing them in a gory way......`
` Destroying half of their heads?!`
` The sick shit you witches and demons pull never fails to piss me off...!"`
`"Destroying half of their heads...... I see.`
` So she noticed that the most ideal method of killing, in all the games up until now, was this one."`
`"Ideal?`
` How the crap is this grotesque way of killing ideal?!"`
`"......It's very much ideal.`
` Try and remember the very first game."`
`"You......!`
` So you're that new demon or whatever that just appeared...`
` Goddammit, so the witch's corrosion advanced, and now there are even more unsavory characters...?!"`
`......The more the witch's corrosion progresses, the more Rokkenjima tilts towards the other world.`
`That's why strange people keep appearing one by one.`
`This island is closed off by the typhoon, and not only can no {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s leave it, but new {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s can't appear either.`
`But the more the corrosion progresses, the more witches and demons can appear, without limit.`
` Increasing one by one.`
`By now, perhaps there are more demons than {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s among the characters appearing in this insane tale.`
` ......Their numbers might be precisely the figure representing this mad corrosion.`
`Yeah, I'm sure that's true.`
` And not only are their numbers being affected by the corrosion, their fashion sense apparently is as well.`
`If the corrosion advances any further and even more weird people appear, just what in the world will they be wearing?`
` .........It's too scary for me to imagine...`
`......Aaaah, seriously, give me a break...`
`{n}Please, no more of these weird‐ass people...!!`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*! I can't oblige—they'll keep on coming, more and more!!`
` I'll defile the foolish "closed circle" rule {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s speak of, over and over again...!"`
`"Welcome to my elegant game!`
` Gaap!"`
`".........It's been a long time, Riiche.`
` Been well?`
` ...In fact, you look pretty great.`
` Have you gotten younger?`
` You look two, maybe three hundred years younger than when I last saw you.`
` ............Ah, I see."`
`The demon Grandfather had summoned and introduced as Gaap...`
`took a glance at me, and then grinned as though she'd figured something out on her own.`
`......Honestly, I felt that smile was repulsive.`
`"Looks like she's Beato's friend.`
` ......Which means she must be an extremely unsavory character.`
` Anyway, they were saying something or other about a closed circle, but what does that mean?"`
`"Serial murder mystery novels that occur in places isolated from the outside world, like Rokkenjima is now, are sometimes called closed circles.`
` Since it's isolated from the outside, it's like a circle that's closed.`
` ......Therefore, in general, the characters and suspects are limited."`
`"Having new possible suspects added on one after another from outside the circle goes against the etiquette of mystery novels.`
` ......Basically, the witch is probably trying to desecrate {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s and the mystery genre."`
`".........So you are Gretel?`
` I see, you look like a wise kid, ......*giggle*.`
` I like that kind of kid.`
` ......Their tongues just melt in the mouth."`
`"Gross.`
` ......Keep the jokes to just your clothing."`
`"It's Devilish Pretty's newest, "Jack the Ripper: Christmas Blood".`
` ......Sorry for having a style that a country bumpkin from the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world can't understand."`
`"......Well, I can at least tell it's breathable.`
` Why don't you add a gap down your head while you're at it?`
` Might help your brain cells breathe a bit as well."`
`"Gaap is always sensitive to the fashions of the netherworld!`
` But this year's fads truly are bold.`
` I think I'll order something sometime...!"`
`"For you, Riiche, I'd recommend {nobr:Ali‐Gray}—Alice and the Graveyard.`
` Let's go to {c:86EF9C:666} sometime soon to look at the clothes.`
` You should come over to the netherworld every now and then."`
`"When this game is over, I'll be sure to do that.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`".........Still, your two opponents are pretty cute, Riiche.`
` I'll bet this kid has figured out the meaning of the corpses with their heads half smashed.`
` .........Do you get it, girl......?"`
`"......Just now, she told me to remember the first game.`
` ......What did that mean...?"`
`"Just what it sounds like.`
` ......Remember the first twilight of the very first game.`
` ......When the adults' corpses were found in the gardening shed with the magic circle drawn on it.`
` Remember?"`
`Episode 1.`
` The first twilight.`
`Six people—Krauss, Rudolf, Kyrie, Rosa, Shannon, and Gohda—had died, and each of them had had their head pulverized.........`
`"At that time, there were two types of corpses.`
` The ones with their faces pulverized, and the ones with half of their faces pulverized."`
`"That's right.`
` Four with their faces smashed—Rudolf, Kyrie, Rosa, and Gohda.`
` Two with the sides of their heads smashed—Krauss and Shannon."`
`"......At the time, I had fickly created two types of corpses,`
` but I realized that the former, more atrocious type was actually disadvantageous for me."`
`"......Disadvantageous for you......?`
` ............Right.`
` I get it."`
`That's right.`
` The smashed faces might look atrocious.`
`{n}......But they made it hard to confirm the identity of the person.`
`For example, at that time, Uncle Krauss and Shannon‐chan had had their heads only half‐smashed.`
`That itself was of course atrocious, but because half of their faces remained, it was easy to confirm their identity.`
`But Dad and the other three were different.`
`Because his face had been completely destroyed, even I, his son, could only guess that it had to have been Dad because of his clothes and the like.`
`......In short, it remained unclear until the end whether that really was Dad's corpse.`
`"If this reasoning battle had taken place during the first game as well,`
` I would probably have claimed that, since it was impossible to confirm that those corpses were indeed Dad and the others, there was a possibility that one was a fake corpse.`
` ......After all, Beato didn't state anything in red during that game whatsoever."`
`"Well done. Correct.`
` .........A faked death is one of the basics of the mystery genre.`
` Even if you make a doctor examine the corpse, you can't trust the results if you suspect him of being in league with the culprit.`
` So, corpses that can't guarantee a death for certain always put the witch side at a disadvantage."`
`"You can suspect faked deaths for all corpses, and hypothesize that they are the culprit for the incidents that follow.`
` ......It's a move Battler doesn't like, but it's the most elementary move to use against a witch."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` That's why Beato started using the red.`
` ......With the red truth, she can carry out a perfect autopsy."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` That's how it is.`
` Normally, for the tragedy of the first twilight,`
` I would use the red truth right away, confirming the deaths of these six."`
`"However, as you know, my battle strategy this time is the complete opposite of previous games, and I have switched to using red truth starvation tactics...!"`
`"I will not use the red easily given that you use it as a grounding from which to counterattack.`
` I can just make you come apart at the seams by using the minimum necessary amount of red in just a single place!"`
`"What this means is that no matter how I permit you to rant about your theories for each of the locked rooms, ultimately,`
` I need only smash one of those with a single red truth."`
`"Ihihi!`
` You've been knocking me about with that thing all this goddamn time, and now I've started using it to counterattack, you've gone and put it away again.`
` What a joke."`
`"Anyways, I don't wanna use the red, I wanna be stingy!`
` I wanna bully Battleeer!!"`
`"But how could I guarantee a death for certain without using red?`
` I racked and racked my brains over it.`
` ......It was Gaap that gave me the idea!`
` It truly was a simple method.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"......I just said something obvious and you hit upon the idea.`
` I simply said that you just have to create corpses whose identity and total death can be easily appreciated by anyone who looks at them."`
`"Kuhhihihihi!`
` In short, I combined the two!`
` The face, which is necessary to distinguish their identity; and the symbol of total death, the pulverization of the head, which is the vessel for the soul!"`
`"When I put those two parts neatly together, oh, hey presto!`
` Out came the <perfect> answer of corpses with their heads half destroyed!"`
`"I'll bet you love two‐flavor bread and two‐flavor ice cream.`
` Your greedy childish tastes are so obvious..."`
`".........In any event,`
` even if their heads are half destroyed, we shouldn't assume that they're dead at this point in time."`
`"I know.`
` ......Since Beato is holding out on me and refusing to say anything in red, I should suspect everything.`
` ......Of course, there's no way in hell I'm gonna swallow the magic mass‐murder by the sexy‐assed Chiester babes."`
`"*giggle*.`
` You certainly have become shrewd.`
` ......If this were the first game, you would have swallowed everything."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` An adversary must be like that, or he wouldn't be interesting."`
`"There is no red for now—I suggest you capitalize on that to let your imagination run wild and build up theory upon theory.`
` At the very end, at the very sweetest spot, I'll cut them all down at once with the red truth...!"`
