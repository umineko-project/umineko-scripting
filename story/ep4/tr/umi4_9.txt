`..........................................`
`‘........................Uryu...`
` .........Maria, ...answer me......’`
`"..........................."`
`‘.........Uryu...`
` ......So I really am...`
`...a stuffed animal...?`
` ......I'm made of cloth and cotton,`
` ......so there's no way I can...`
`talk......?`
` ......Is that why...`
`...I can't talk to you.........?’`
`Sakutaro looked up at Maria sadly.`
`Maria's face was covered with tears, and she looked as though she had even lost the emotion of sadness......`
`"............Uu.`
` ......I can hear you, Sakutaro.`
` ......You aren't a stuffed animal made of cloth and cotton.`
` .........You're my...friend.`
` ..................Hate Ange.`
` ......Uuu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}uuu......"`
`‘Uryu... I'm sorry Maria, I'm sorry Maria......!`
` Uryu......!’`
`Sakutaro felt regret.`
` By freezing her heart, Maria had finally been able to escape from her sadness.`
`...By speaking up and calling her back, he had caused her to become overwhelmed with sadness again...`
`Sakutaro tried toddling up to Maria and hugging her, then letting go,`
` gazing at her appearance uneasily and trying it again, lost as to how he could bring Maria's spirits up.`
`......He might have looked a little humorous doing that.`
`As a result, that was able to divert Maria's feelings from sadness......`
`"Sorry.`
` .........More crying won't help anything."`
`‘You got in a fight with Ange, but you still have a lot of friends, Maria...`
` Not just me.`
` .........You have everyone else too.`
` Sakusuke and Sakukichi, the animal band, and many, many more......’`
`Maria looked at the many stuffed animals around her pillow, which were gathered together as though they were having a conference.`
`‘......They're all...worried about you, Maria.`
` They've all been discussing and discussing how to cheer you up, you know......?’`
`"....................................`
` ......They won't......go away...like Ange...?"`
`‘They won't.`
` We'll always be together.’`
`".........Really?`
` You're all only with me at home.`
` Can't go out together when Mama's with us, and can't go together to school."`
`‘We aren't allowed to go to school, so you'll get in trouble if the teacher finds out.`
` But if no one finds out, we can be together at any time.’`
`"......Sakutaro, you're big, so you'd be found."`
`‘Then you can take some of the kids that are small enough to walk around with.`
` ......For example...what about them?`
` If you take the friends in the forest band,`
` ......look, they're small, so they can hide in your pocket and go to school with you.’`
`".........There's a lot of them in the band.`
` Can't fit them all in my pockets."`
`She gathered all of the forest band pieces that were scattered across her bed.`
`There were about as many of them as pieces in a chess set, so it would probably be impossible to fit them all in her pocket...`
`‘In that case, you can just take friends that you're especially close with.`
` ......Why don't you take the four rabbits, the ones you're closest to in the forest band?’`
`"......Four could fit in my pocket.`
` ......Yeah.`
` This way, they won't be found."`
`‘So this way, you won't be alone even at school, Maria.`
` Those kids will be with you even where I can't go.’`
`"...............Yeah.`
` ......Maybe...won't be lonely that way.`
` ......Maybe I can hold out......until I get home from school..."`
`‘As long as we aren't found by the teacher or Mama, we can be with you at any time.`
` So let's be together forever, play together forever.`
` We definitely won't leave you all alone, Maria.`
` Uryu!’`
`Maria's expression finally regained a little of its brightness.`
`......That's right.`
` Thinking about it, my world didn't start out with Ange in it.`
`Even without Ange, everyone was together and it was fun.`
`So it's weird to suddenly get sad just because Ange's gone when she was the last to come in.`
`...All that's happened is that I've returned to the world right before Ange entered it.`
`{n}......So there's nothing to be sad about.`
`"......Yeah.`
` Not lonely.`
` Sakutaro and everyone else is with me."`
`‘Uryuu!`
` Loooove you, Maria...!’`
`"I won't let any more {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s come into my world.`
` ......Mariage Sorcière is an alliance only between me and {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......Even Beato opposed letting Ange join in the beginning.`
` .........It's alright this way.`
` Ange was still too young."`
`‘......Until you can be friends with Ange again, I think it's okay to forget about her for now.`
` Just wait until you've regained your high spirits, and then play with her again.`
` Until then, all of us will be by your side.’`
`".........Thanks.`
` ......Sakutaro, ......everyone."`
`Then, I once again regained my former world.`
`{n}I regained the world where I wasn't lonely, and where I was surrounded by many friends.`
`As always, I didn't have any {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} friends at school, but my magic friends were always with me.`
`Even during class, I could hear the rabbit band hiding in my pocket talking together and giggling, and they sounded like they were having a lot of fun.`
`Just listening to that added a lot of color to those lonely school hours.`
`I made sure that my other friends, too, were always with me, as long as Mama and the teacher wouldn't find out.`
`When Mama told me to go play outside, I would secretly pack Sakutaro and Sakusuke and the rest into my bag, and play together at the library or somewhere.`
`And when Mama was late coming home and I went shopping for dinner, I always went with them.`
`The men working at the convenience store were always nice to Sakutaro.`
`{n}Sometimes they even gave me two extra things for free, one for me and one for Sakutaro.`
`Whenever Mama found out, I would get in trouble for bringing Sakutaro and the rest outside.`
`Whenever the teacher found out, I would get in trouble for bringing toys to school.`
`The toxin must be strong in Mama and the teacher.`
` That's why Sakutaro and the others just look like normal stuffed animals to them.`
`After all, the men at the convenience store say hello to Sakutaro.`
`.........Not all {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s are worthless.`
` There are a ton of people who, unlike Ange and Mama and my teacher, can say hello to magic friends like I can......`
`"Oh, Maria‐chan.`
` Welcome.`
` Is your mama late coming home tonight too...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ......But Sakutaro's with me, so I'm not lonely.`
` Right, Sakutaro?"`
`‘Uryuu.`
` It's not just me today.`
` Other friends are also with us.’`
`"Oh, other friends?`
` What kind of friends are with you today?"`
`"Today, the rabbits from the forest band are also with me.`
` ......Look, they're in my pocket."`
`Maria began to line up four ceramic rabbit dolls on the register.`
`As the owner of the shop looked at them with a smile, he signaled a part‐timer with his chin.`
`The sign on the other register that said "closed" was taken down, and the part‐timer called out for everyone to move over there.`
`All of the people in line behind Maria formed a new line over there instead...`
`"Yes, I see.`
` You sure have a lot of friends, Maria‐chan.`
` But I hope your mama comes home soon."`
`"Uu.`
` Mama is busy with work again, so she's staying at the company.`
` She's very busy lately.`
` ......She hasn't even been able to get much time to talk to me on the phone."`
`"But I'm not lonely!`
` I have Sakutaro and all the rest!`
` Right?"`
`‘Uryuu!!’`
`"All of the rabbits in the band are with me too.`
` Look.`
` Kyuu‐kyuu{p:0:♪}"`
`"Is kyuu‐kyuu the sound a rabbit makes?`
` Come to think of it, I've never heard one."`
`After smiling at Sakutaro, who was poking his head out of her knapsack,`
` she played around with the rabbit band on the register, making them frolic around.`
`Even as he gazed at this heartwarming sight, the shop manager had a slightly pitying look on his face.`
`......This was apparently a family without a father, and where the mother had to work hard and couldn't come home very often.`
`On top of that, it looked like this girl didn't even have any friends.`
`As he watched this girl play around happily with her dolls and claim that she wasn't lonely despite everything,`
` he couldn't help but feel a kind of compassion.`
`And actually, this wasn't limited to him alone.`
` Maria had become very famous in this shopping district...`
`"Maria‐chan, you should eat some oden every once in a while.`
` You won't grow if you don't eat your eggs and fish paste."`
`"Uu?`
` Can't get a cream roll...?"`
`‘Uryu.`
` You need variety or you won't get big.`
` How about oden for today?’`
`"Uu.`
` ......Okay, I'll have oden."`
`"Yep yep, that's the ticket.`
` Why don't I stick a whole bunch in there.`
` Want mustard?"`
`‘Uryuu.`
` I can't handle spicy things......’`
`"Alright, I see.`
` Then, you make sure you don't let it spill on the way home.`
` Best eat it while it's hot."`
`"Uu.`
` Thank you."`
`She had planned on getting some sweet pastries for dinner like usual, but since oden had been recommended to her, she would be having that tonight instead.`
`Letting someone else determine the menu makes for an unexpected and interesting meal.`
`......Very often, Maria had to decide on her own what to have for dinner, so it was easy for the menu to get a little one‐sided.`
` So it felt fun to look forward to a meal she hadn't anticipated...`
`‘Uryuu!`
` Thanks for giving us extra, mister!’`
`"Send my regards to your other friends at home.`
` No nibbling at it on the way home, now.`
` Go straight home and eat it there."`
`"Uu!`
` Thanks, mister!!"`
`Maria held the bag with the oden container high for all to see......`
`".................................`
` .........Huh......?"`
`‘......Uryu?`
` What is it, Maria?’`
`".........The key isn't in my pocket."`
`Standing in front of the door to her house, Maria searched and patted all over her body.`
`{n}......The key to the house wasn't there.`
`She always methodically put it in the same pocket.`
` So there was no way she had put it in another pocket, but she searched her whole body just in case.`
`......It really wasn't there.`
`‘Did you drop it when you took your wallet out......?’`
`"No.`
` Definitely felt it when I took my wallet out.`
` Also definitely felt it when I checked my pocket on the way home."`
`"......It was there until partway.`
` Didn't drop it!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu...!"`
`The late autumn wind had been made bearable by the thought of the heater that was waiting at home,`
` but now that Maria had lost her key and had no idea what to do, she was really feeling it.`
`But no matter how hard she searched, she couldn't find her key.`
` She turned out all her pockets, and even tried taking off her jacket and hitting it, but to no avail.`
`......Of course, she also turned the knapsack Sakutaro was in upside down, but no key came out.`
`".........Uu.`
` .........Uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`Something that should have been there...wasn't where it was supposed to be.`
`{n}Why isn't the key there, when I didn't do anything wrong?`
`......Why isn't it?!`
`{n}Why?!`
` Why...?!!!`
`Maria stamped on the ground, cold and frustrated and angry...`
`{n}The bottom of her foot throbbed, but even so, it didn't lessen her frustration.`
`......Before long, bitter tears were pouring down her face.`
`"......Uu.`
` ......Uu!!`
` Uuuu!!"`
`It wasn't her fault.`
` So it was someone else's.`
`But Maria didn't know who that someone was, and could do nothing but continue to let out a moan of anger.`
`‘......Uryu......`
` You must have dropped it partway...`
` Let's look for it, okay?`
` Let's go back the way we came and search, okay...?’`
`"......Uu...`
` I was excited to buy oden, ......and I got eggs and stuff for free......`
` Can't eat it while it's hot......`
` .........Uuuuu!!!"`
`‘...Maria......I know it's frustrating, but let's search, okay...?`
` It's no one's fault... Let's search...’`
`Maria finally lent an ear to Sakutaro's words, and began to plod back the way she came.`
`......The wind was colder than it had been, and felt like it was blowing in through the gaps in her jacket to spite her...`
`‘Uryu...`
` Let's watch our feet closely and search, okay...?`
` And then let's get home quickly, and eat oden while getting warm by the heater, okay?`
` I'm sure it'll taste good.’`
`".........Uu.`
` ......Not here.`
` ......Uu.`
` ......Not here..."`
`As Sakutaro encouraged her, Maria searched for the key...`
`But she made it all the way back to the convenience store where she'd bought the oden.`
`{n}......She hadn't found it.`
`Just in case, she asked the man at the convenience store whether they had found a dropped key,`
` but they hadn't found anything.`
`......One more time, she returned home, paying close attention to the area around her feet.`
`{n}But still—she didn't find it.`
`She was no longer frustrated enough to stomp her feet.`
`{n}......But hot tears dripped down her face.`
`The oden was stone cold.`
`...Even though the man at the shop had said to eat it while it was hot, she hadn't been able to.`
`......He had given her so much extra stuff for free......`
`‘......Uryu......`
` Don't cry......`
` ......Mama isn't coming back tonight.`
` ......Let's do our best to search......’`
`".........Why can't I find it...`
` ......Uuuu............uuuuuuuu!"`
`‘Maria, don't cry...!`
` Let's do our best to search...!`
` .........Maria......’`
`Maria was no longer able to hold back her tears.`
`Sobbing, clutching Sakutaro, and with the oden bag in her hand, she returned once more down the road she had come by.`
`Perhaps because it was now later at night, and more houses and stores had turned their lights off by now, it was even darker and harder to search than before.`
`......And, once again without finding the key, she returned to the convenience store.`
`"Maria‐chan,`
` ......you still can't find your key...?"`
`"...Uu...`
` ......Key, ......gone..."`
`"Your mother was away for the night?`
` You can't get into your house without a key?"`
`"Uu......`
` ......Can't get in......"`
`"Well, that is a pretty pickle...`
` Did you try going to the police?`
` It might have been handed in."`
`"...............Mama said not to talk to policemen, even if they start talking to me."`
`"Hm? Now why on Earth is that?"`
`"................................."`
`It was probably because Rosa felt guilty for making such a young girl as Maria watch over the house by herself,`
` and because she knew that this was not socially acceptable.`
`So she had indoctrinated Maria into changing the stores she bought things at so that she didn't catch the eyes of adults,`
` and saying no more than a greeting to policemen, even if they talked to her.`
`Maria had obediently done as she was told.`
`Instead of considering why she had to do that,`
` honestly obeying because her mother had told her so was far more important to her.`
`But the manager of the convenience store probably didn't think of it that way.`
`......Naturally, seeing such a young girl being forced to watch over the house alone,`
` and so frequently, would cause anyone to worry......`
`......And then.`
` After making the round trip between her home and the store once more, and arriving at the convenience store for a third time...`
`...a policeman was there.`
`"That's the girl.`
` ......Maria‐chan, did you find your key?"`
`".........Uu...`
` ......Can't find it......"`
`"What's your name, little girl?"`
`"........................"`
`The policeman asked her name, but Maria didn't answer.`
`"Did your mother tell you not to talk with policemen?`
` Hahah.`
` Don't worry, no need to be scared of me.`
` Have you eaten dinner yet, little girl?"`
`".........Bought it, but can't get into the house, so I can't eat it."`
`"What's your mother doing?`
` Is she not coming home today?`
` Is she working?"`
`"..................Uu."`
`"Do you know how we can contact your mother's work?"`
`"........................"`
`Maria hung her head limply.`
`......She didn't understand why the policeman was getting mad at her.`
`No, he probably wasn't getting mad at her, but if this reached her mother's ears, she would definitely be in trouble.`
`Even if she didn't understand the reason why she would be in trouble, she at least understood that much.`
`But the policeman wouldn't let Maria go.`
`{n}And her head was swimming from hunger.`
`The policeman noticed that, and it was decided that they could talk as they ate in the police box.`
`......I was taken to the police box.`
` I had my oden heated in a microwave oven, and there were even {ruby:shio daifuku:salty rice cakes} and hot tea brought out for me.`
`I'd been told not to talk to policemen,`
` ......but as I answered questions about Sakutaro, I started to feel like he wasn't a bad person, and...`
`...I wouldn't be able to return home anyway, so I didn't know what to do, so...`
`.........I told him Mama's work phone number,`
` ......which I wasn't supposed to tell anyone, and was told to use only in a very, very serious situation.`
`In the tatami room inside the police box, as I ate the oden that was so hot it felt like it would burn me,`
` I watched the policeman making the phone call, and lazily thought, "......aah, I'm probably going to get in trouble..."`
`"............Is Mama...going to be mad at me.........?"`
`‘......Uryu.........’`
`He must have been listening to the phone ringing for a very long time.`
` With the receiver up to his ear, the policeman looked up at the clock and grumbled.`
`"............Maybe they aren't picking up because their business hours are over.`
` ......Hmmmmmm.`
` ......Ah.`
` Hello?`
` Hello?`
` Is this Auntie Rosa Co., Ltd.?"`
`"This is the Komatsugawa Police Department police box in front of Senbonzakura Station.`
` Is President...umm, {c:86EF9C:Udaikan}...no, sorry, President Ushiromiya‐san available?`
` ............Yes.`
` ......Whaat?`
` {i:Vacation}?"`
`"Yes.`
` The president's off for three days starting yesterday.`
` Umm, perhaps I could be of assistance...?"`
`"Oh no no no, that's quite alright.`
` So, do you know where she may be?`
` Have you heard how she can be contacted, by any chance?"`
`"Uhh, ......would you mind waiting for just a moment?`
` ...............Hey, anyone know where the president's taking her vacation?`
` How to get hold of her?"`
`"Heard she was going for all‐you‐can‐eat crabs in Sapporo with her boyfriend.`
` Lucky girl, cold places are great for bringing a couple closer together, don't you think?`
` Haven't heard how to get in touch with them."`
`"Okie‐dokie.`
` ......Uhh, hello.`
` I hear she went to Sapporo, but I'm not sure about how to reach her.`
` ......Can I take a message?"`
`"Hmm, I see... That's awkward.`
` Well, if you make contact with her again, could you tell her that we called?`
` Yes, that's right."`
`......After that, I was taken to the police station, which was bigger than the police box,`
` and they said I could spend the night there.`
`And they asked me all kinds of things about myself.`
`A lady who called herself the district welfare officer came by and asked about various things.`
`And she said to me, "You poor thing".`
`{n}When I heard that, I learned for the first time.`
`"............Am I.........a poor thing......?"`
`‘......Uryu......`
` That's not true... You're happy, Maria......’`
`"...............Uu..."`
`And......Rosa came back.`
`Maria was told to go to her room,`
` ...but on her way back from the bathroom, she hid by the entrance to the living room and listened in on the exchange.`
`The person who had come to visit...was the female district welfare officer who had asked Maria various questions the other day.`
`"Don't be so pushy!!`
` Maria's heart is too innocent and delicate, so if there was an insensitive kid there, she could be hurt!!`
` Please stop your unwanted meddling!!"`
`"But in that case, ma'am,`
` if the child is so delicate, why leave her home all alone?`
` Shouldn't a mother be there for her child?"`
`"I am here for her as much as I can be!!`
` I have no idea what makes you think I need ordering around...!!"`
`"Really?`
` She is very well known in this area, you know.`
` They say that your daughter frequently goes out at night to buy things and eat.`
` Everyone was worried and looking out for her."`
`"How do you know that was my child?!!`
` Children are a dime a dozen around town!!`
` Don't just assume that it's my Maria!!"`
`"Kids sometimes walk around outside at night, don't they?!`
` How can you prove that all of those are my child?!"`
`"A girl holding a lion stuffed animal often came around to eat dinner and buy things.`
` She was very famous around the shopping district."`
`"Everyone treated Maria‐chan with care out of concern for her.`
` Sometimes, people even escorted her home, thinking the streets might be dangerous at night."`
`"Y‐you can find lion stuffed animals anywhere!!`
` It was none of their business, escorting her home!!`
` Are they thinking of kidnapping her or something?!"`
`"Don't fuss over Maria!!`
` Maria is my child.`
` I am raising her!`
` I have absolutely no intention of putting her in some strange institution!!`
` Stop your needless meddling!!"`
`‘U‐......uryu......`
` Does that lion stuffed animal...`
`...mean me......?’`
`"......It's alright.`
` I'm the one who's in trouble...`
` It has nothing to do with you, Sakutaro......"`
`Maria hugged Sakutaro, continuing to watch her mother fearfully...`
`"I, I also wish I could be with Maria every day!"`
`"But I'm a single mother, so I have to work!`
` I may not look it, but I'm a president of a company, and I bear the responsibility for my employees' well‐being!!`
` I'm busy with my work all year round, there's no time for me to rest!!"`
`"{i:Really}?`
` But you've been off work for the last three days, haven't you?"`
`"I, I have not been off work!`
` I've been staying at my company for several nights working!!`
` There's a mountain of matters to be taken care of that the other unreliable employees can't handle!!"`
`"Why are you lying like that?`
` The people at your company told us that you were taking a three‐day vacation, you know?`
` You went to Hokkaido with your boyfriend, right?`
` Leaving your daughter by herself for three whole days...!"`
`"I, I don't know anything about any boyfriend I don't know anything about Hokkaido!!!`
` Why are you coming out with all this nonsense?!`
` Why, why?!`
` Do you have any proof?!`
``
` What's wrong with you, don't just start butting in on someone else's family matters!!"`
`"I love Maria, I have my own way of loving her, so just keep your mouth shut!!`
` I didn't go on a vacation, I was working the whole time, I was working!!"`
`"I was trying to finish things up at work with all my strength, all my strength because I wanted to see Maria as soon as I could!!`
` I stayed at the company working and working and working and working and working, working and working and working and working!!"`
`"I don't know anything I don't know anything, I don't know anything about Hokkaido, don't come in saying all this!!! Uuuaaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}AAa{0}a{0}aAA{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}AAHHH!!!`
` Please, just go!!`
` Just go!!!!!`
` What is wrong with you?!?!`
` Just go!!`
` JUST GO{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}OOO!!!"`
`Rosa raged, her hair flying wildly.`
`She stood up with such force that her teacup fell over,`
` and far louder than that noise was the sound of her beating the table with both hands.`
`When faced with this rage that could accurately be described as wide‐eyed derangement,`
` the female welfare officer couldn't help but be taken aback.`
`......And the same went for Maria, who was secretly watching this from the hallway.`
`She had seen her mother enraged several times before.`
`{n}But she had never seen her go this berserk with anger.`
`Seeing this, Maria was sure.`
`{n}......This was no longer her mother.`
`It was some other evil being that was possessing her mother's body...`
`And then, the evil being discovered her.`
`{n}Maria learned that she was being reflected in the evil being's eyes.`
`Her mind went blank, and she felt as though her field of vision was racing off into the distance......`
`After fiercely closing in on Maria, Rosa mercilessly bore down on her small shoulders,`
` ......and dropped her gaze onto the stuffed animal Maria was holding: Sakutaro.`
`".........Maria.`
` Even though I told you so many times not to bring that outside,`
` ......you brought it with you, didn't you?"`
`‘U‐......uryu.........`
` I‐it's not Maria's fault......`
` I said I'd come with her......’`
`"Th‐that's not true......!`
` I brought Sakutaro on my own because I was lonely...!`
` So Mama, it's not Sakutaro's fault...!!"`
`‘Uryu...... Maria.........’`
`"It's not Sakutaro's fault!!`
` It's not Sakutaro's fault!!"`
`The brunt of Rosa's anger was aimed, not at Maria, but at the lion stuffed animal Maria was holding.`
`......A girl came shopping in the middle of the night, always clutching a lion stuffed animal.`
`Because of that, she had become well known in the shopping district...`
`"I,`
` ......I,`
` ...I told you not to take stuffed animals with yo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ouuu!!!`
` Why—!!`
` Can't you—!!`
` Listen to what Mama says!!"`
`"Why?!`
` Why, why?!`
` Why can't you follow Mama's ru{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}ules!!"`
`With every single word, she stamped her heel and banged furiously on the wall.`
`......Admittedly, she wasn't making direct contact with Maria.`
`However, the violence of that harsh sound certainly beat against her.`
`"M‐Ma'am...... Stop that......!!"`
`"Let go!!`
` I said let go, damn iiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`The welfare officer had come back to her senses and put Rosa in a full nelson.`
`But the instant Rosa was touched, she went wild, furiously throwing the welfare officer off.`
`......She hit the table and fell to the ground.`
` A teacup on the table smashed on the floor, making a violent sound...`
`‘M‐......Maria didn't do anything wrong......!`
` It's my fault!`
` So don't scold Maria......!!’`
`"I'm the one who brought Sakutaro...!!`
` It's not Sakutaro's fault!!`
` It's not Sakutaro's fault!!`
` So don't look at Sakutaro with those scary eyes!!`
` Don't look at hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiim!!"`
`‘Don't scold Maria...!`
` Don't scold Maria...!!`
` Uryuuu!!!’`
`"........................Wh‐.........what in the...`
` Just what do you think you're doing?"`
`"Did you...also play with dolls like that......outside?`
` Did you do it in front of the people at the store......?"`
`"........................`
` Then OF COURSE they remembered yoooooooou,`
` THINK a little, you idiot!! Why are you such a DUMBAA{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}AAASSS!!!"`
`"Answer me honestly.`
` When you went out shopping, you always walked around with that stuffed animal without telling Mama, right?"`
`‘.........U‐......uryu.........’`
`"Stop using that weird stuffed animal talk!!!`
` Speak with your own words, not a stuffed animal's!!!"`
`"S‐Sakutaro isn't a stuffed animal!!`
` He's my friend!!`
` Don't call him a stuffed animal......`
` Dooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oon't!!"`
`"Yes, yes, fine, Sakutarou, it was called Sakutarou!`
` You took that Sakutarou doll with you all the time when you went shopping, without telling Mama, right?"`
`"Y‐......yeah..............."`
`Maria admitted it honestly.`
`If she hadn't admitted it, then Sakutaro would have said something to take the blame,`
` so by admitting it right away, she was protecting her small friend.`
`"Only Sakutarou?`
` Any others?`
` ......You haven't...been bringing weird things to school too, have you...?"`
`"......M‐Ma'am!!`
` This is not your daughter's fault!`
` Stop this interrogation at once!"`
`"You bite your tongue!!!`
` I am talking with my daughter!!!`
` ......Alright, Maria, look at Mama when you talk.`
` What's the answer to Mama's question?"`
`"U‐......uu......`
` ......Not just Sakutaro.`
` ......All the rabbits too......"`
`".........Do you have them with you now......?"`
`"Uu........."`
`Maria fished around in her pocket,`
` ......and pulled out those four ceramic rabbits with her tiny hand...`
`The rabbits were her precious friends, who could go to school with her in Sakutaro's place.`
`But when Rosa saw that, she shook her head slightly as though dizzy...`
`In Maria's {c:86EF9C:communication booklet}, a note had been written that Maria was apparently bringing toys to school and playing with them,`
` and it requested Rosa to give her home instruction to try to prevent this.`
`But Rosa had dismissed the teacher's comment as faultfinding, and on the contrary, had phoned the school to make a complaint of her own.`
`...Saying that there was no way her child would bring toys to school.`
`For nearly an hour, she had shouted at the vice principal to stop making false accusations about her daughter.`
`......To a certain degree, the school grasped that Maria was a pitiful girl.`
`They knew that the small toys she brought in were her only friends.`
`......So they had done their best to overlook it.`
`But when the other students caught sight of them,`
` some of the boys started complaining that only she was allowed to bring toys, and the school had racked their brains on how to cope with this......`
`They had tried to gently send a warning by way of the mother,`
` but after Rosa's overreaction, even Maria's teacher had decided to overlook it.`
`.........But now Rosa knew.`
`She had been the one who was wrong, ...and her daughter really had been bringing toys into school.`
`.........And the school...`
`had seen the sorry sight of her bringing toys into school and playing with them as her only friends.`
`To Rosa, who knew her daughter was a little different from normal children,`
` having this peculiar side of her daughter exposed and found fault with was more unbearable than anything.`
`.........So she howled.`
` She raged.`
`The welfare officer tried to cut between Rosa and Maria again,`
` but she only met with Rosa's wrath again.`
`Rosa once again threw the woman off with a face like a demon,`
` and when even that failed to curb her anger, she stomped on the ground over and over again so forcefully that it seemed she might break through the floor.`
`Then, after seeming to come back to her senses for just a second,`
` .........she suddenly froze her rough breathing, and asked Maria.`
`"........................`
` ......Maria.`
` Those rabbits in the band, are they your close friends?"`
`"U‐.........uu........."`
`"I see.`
` I'm glad you have a full four friends."`
`As she said that, Rosa took one of the rabbits from Maria's hand.`
`Then, she shoved it in front of Maria's eyes so she could see it very well.`
`......It was a cute little doll, like a chess piece, of a rabbit holding a trumpet.`
`She slowly lifted it into the air.`
`......Of course, Maria's and Sakutaro's eyes also followed it......`
`And then, with a speed that the eye couldn't follow, she hurled it against the wall.`
`"Eek—!!!!"`
`‘...............!!!’`
`She had half‐imagined that this worst possible thing might happen.`
`{n}So she instantly realized what had been done.`
`......So Maria let out a short, despairing scream...`
`It was in pieces.`
`It had been small and sturdy, but not enough to accept her mother's fierce rage.`
`".........Because you didn't listen to what Mama told you, one of them broke.`
` From now on, every time you disobey something Mama says, I'll break another one.`
` ......Remember that!!!"`
`"You......you call yourself a mother after doing something like that?!!`
` You think you can do something like that without hurting your daughter?!"`
`"Hurt {i:Maria}?!`
` I'm hurting too, you know?!`
` Who's gonna take responsibility for {i:my} wounds?!`
` Weeeell?!`
` WHOOOOOOOO!!!`
` I told you to bite your tongue!!!!!"`
`"S‐stop it, Mama......!`
` It's my fault...!`
` Don't get mad at this lady......!"`
`‘It isn't Maria's fault... It's mine......!`
` Don't get mad at Maria...!`
` Uryu, uryu‐uryu‐uryu, uryuuu!’`
`"I, .........I told you to stop playing make‐believe with that stuffed animaaaaaaaal!!`
` In the first place, it's disturbing, a stuffed animal is your friend? Just how old are you this year?!`
` How old?!`
` Weeelll?!"`
`"This is just a gross, crappy stuffed animal made of cloth and cotton!!`
` Is this the only kind of friend you have?!`
` If you have enough time on your hands to play make‐believe friends with this monstrous stuffed animal, go out and make some real human friends instead!!"`
`"Why is it that time goes on and on and you still can't make any friends?!!`
` That's why your class always treats you like a weirdo and makes fun of you!!`
` Cut it out, give it a rest, get ahold of yourself already!!`
` Grow up from this stuffed‐animal play!!"`
`‘Uryu......`
`uryu.........’`
`"I said...stop playing make‐believe...with that stuffed animaaaaaaaal!!"`
`"Aaah!!`
` Mama, Mama!!`
` Give him back!`
` Give Sakutaro baaaaaaaaaaack!!"`
`‘Uryuu!!`
` Uryuuu!`
` Uryu‐uryuu!’`
`Mama grabbed hold of Sakutaro's head, and snatched him from me...`
`{n}Then.........she smashed him against the wall, over and over.`
`‘Uryuu!!`
` It hurts, it hurts, ow‐ow‐ow‐ow...!!’`
`"Fucking STOP!!`
` Fucking STOP playing make‐believe with this stuffed animal!!!!!`
` It's because of this stuffed animal!!"`
`"That's why you can never make any friends!`
` That's why you're the only one in your class who sticks out like a sore thumb, and gets treated like a weird kid!!`
` I should never have given you a stuffed animal like this!!`
` I should never have given you this disgusting stuffed animal!!"`
`"Stop iiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`"Give Sakutaro back, give Sakutaro back!!`
` WaaaA{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}A{0}a{0}a{0}AahHH!!`
` Sakutaro is my friend!!`
` My best friend!!`
` I don't need anything else if I just have Sakutaro!`
` So give him back!!`
` Give him baaaaaaaack!!"`
`......For some reason, my frantic request just added oil to the fire of Mama's anger......`
`As I pulled on Sakutaro trying to take him back, Mama pushed my arm aside,`
` and in a bizarre way, she stuck her fingernails on both hands deep into Sakutaro, twisting him......`
`The red scarf, which I had carefully wrapped for him every day, came undone and fell to the floor...`
`......Sakutarou, who had been so, so precious to me......`
`He was crumpled, twisted, torn at with fingernails so much......`
`He was twisted in pain...`
`his face grimacing...`
`so sadly.........`
`Then Mama's fingernails...`
`...found a stitch on the neck`
`......and tore it...`
`......With the fingernails of both hands`
`......she tore him apart............`
`In that instant,`
` .........Sakutaro's yellow cloth,`
` .........and the cotton inside, ...burst apart......`
`It looked almost like moist cotton candy......`
`‘......U‐...............ryu.....................’`
`"...kutaro............?"`
`‘......Ma......ria.........’`
`".........Sakutaro............"`
`‘U......ryu......{m:-5:―――}’`
`"...............kutaro............"`
`‘{m:-5:―}―...... . . .   .         ’`
`".........ta...ro........."`
`‘’`
`...`
`.........The crumpled yellow cloth and the cotton candy that was flowing out were thrust right in front of my eyes.`
`Then, ......through Mama's face, the evil being...stated it clearly.`
`"{i:Sakutarou is dead}."`
`mabapennedbisgeck.`
`gikuguki`
`......kutaro`
`......sakuta`

`......waaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuu............`
`"{f:5:Maria}...... ......{f:5:Maria}.........`
` ...Do not cry......"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}, {f:5:Beatrice}...!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"Sakutarou was a good friend...`
` As long as you do not forget that, he will always be with you...`
` So do not cry..."`
`"Bring him back to life!!`
` You can use a lot of magic, Beato!!`
` You can bring Sakutaro back to life as well, right?!"`
`"............A‐about that......`
` ...Of course, if Sakutarou had been my furniture, it would be easy.`
` However, Sakutarou is your furniture.`
` ......That makes it difficult for me."`
`"Difficult but not impossible, right?!`
` Bring him back to life!!`
` Bring him back to life with the Endless Magiiiiiic!"`
`".........Hmm...`
` ......To tell the truth...`
` Sakutarou's vessel was a stuffed animal Rosa made herself, correct...?`
` That Rosa has denied Sakutarou.`
` ......A life that is not permitted by its own mother cannot exist..."`
`{f:5:Beatrice}'s words were feeble.`
`...Because she knew that, no matter what the excuse,`
` it wouldn't be enough to calm Maria and make her accept it.`
`But she had to communicate the painful truth to her disciple and close friend.`
`.........She had to tell her the fact...`
`...that even with all of her own magic, even she could not revive Sakutarou.`
`"As long as you continue to strongly believe in Sakutarou's existence, his soul will not disappear......`
` So, {f:5:Maria}, ...please, do not be sad...`
` Even now, look, ...you must believe that Sakutarou is smiling right over there......"`
`"No!!!`
` No`
` no`
` no!!`
` You have to bring Sakutaro back to life!!`
` No no no!`
` WaaA{0}AAa{0}a{0}a{0}aAAa{0}a{0}aAa{0}aAahhhh!!"`
`"Give up...!!`
` There is no magic to revive Sakutarou...!`
` You must strongly believe that even in spite of that, Sakutarou will continue to exist as your close friend...!!`
` That power will become magic...!"`
`"That's not magic, that's not magic!!`
` You have to bring Sakutaro back to life...!!"`
`"Can't you do it because Mama made him herself?`
` Why did Mama make Sakutaro?`
` Wasn't it to give him to me as a present?`
` Wasn't it to make him my friend?"`
`"But why...did Mama make him herself...and break him herself?`
` Why did Mama create him herself, and try to break him herself?`
` Don't get it, don't get it!!"`
`"Hate Mama, hate Mama...!!`
` Can't stand it, can't stand it, it's too much, it's too much...!!`
` Want to twist Mama up like she did to Sakutaro...!`
` Want to stick my fingernails in and tear her, turn her into cloth and cotton!!"`
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!`
` Can't stand it, I can't stand it, {f:5:Beatriceeee}!!`
` Waa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh, Sakutaroooooooo!!!!"`
`From the darkness behind Maria's back, two massive jet‐black arms crept out,`
` coiling around Maria as she sobbed in anger.`
`Then massive fingernails stuck into Maria's chest and stomach......`
`Maria could not see them.`
`{n}......But Beato could.`
`Anger and sadness without any place to go will tear you apart.`
`......Beato knew that.`
` She could see that.`
`Yes.`
` ......In the end, those massive arms were Maria's own.`
`Those fingernails slowly started to dig into her chest and stomach......`
`......With their immense size and strength,`
` those arms would probably tear Maria into bits easily......`
`But Maria herself couldn't notice.`
`Drowning in a sea of her own tears, ......she couldn't notice that her own arms were trying to tear apart her own chest......`
`"Can't stand it, can't stand it...!!!`
` If Sakutaro can't be brought back to life no matter what, ......I want revenge!!`
` Want to make the same thing happen to Mama!!`
` Want to make her suffer the same thing as Sakutaro...!"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` Teach me magic for that!!`
` Teach me magic to get back at Mama...!!"`
`".................................`
` ......Are those your true feelings?"`
`"I'll kill Mama!!`
` I'll kill her!!`
` No, that's not Mama!`
` It's the bad witch possessing Mama!`
` I'll kill the witch Mama!!`
` Uuu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}uuu!!"`
`"........................`
` ......Very well.`
` I shall give you that power.`
` ......If you, beautiful of heart, shall otherwise be torn asunder by your own hand...`
`...then I find your heartless mother, who brought such suffering upon you, considerably more deserving of such a fate."`
`"...............I shall teach you.`
` ......Of the abyss in the world of witches, of the depths where no light reaches......"`
`"Uuuuuuuu, Sakutaro, Sakutaro...!!`
` I hate everyone, I hate them, I HATE THEM!!`
` Hate Mama, hate Ange!!`
` Hate everyone, EVERYONE!!`
` Uuuuuuwaa{0}a{0}aaAAA{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}AAAAHHH......!!"`
