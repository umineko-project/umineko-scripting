`I had been trying to take a nap, ......but the boat really was shaking bad.`
`I gave up on sleeping and went up onto the deck.`
`{n}I was welcomed by the shining sun and a strong sea breeze...`
`Up on the deck, Amakusa was doing some stretches.`
`......He probably has a lot of time on his hands too.`
`{n}It'll still take a while longer to reach Niijima.`
`It would only have taken on the order of half an hour by airplane, but there was the chance that the Sumaderas' net extended over Niijima airport.`
`The harbor would probably be the same.`
` For that reason, I had obtained a boat that would let me land while avoiding the harbor, with no questions asked.`
`I'd bumped into a cheery boat captain,`
` treated him with generosity, and he had decided to help me out, amused......`
`"Still going to be a while?"`
`"I just asked the captain, and it sounds like it'll take a full two hours more.`
` Well, beggars can't be choosers."`
`".........The weather sure is nice.`
` Feels like I'll burn."`
`"Going to read on the deck?`
` You'll damage your book."`
`Amakusa apparently got that idea because I was clutching Maria onee‐chan's diary under my arm.`
`I'd been reading it as I tried to fall asleep, which was why I had come back up still carrying it.`
`"How's it going?`
` Think you'll be able to find the truth of Rokkenjima from Maria‐san's diary?"`
`"............Who knows.`
` No matter how much I investigate what happened on that island, it won't make for anything more than a theory.`
` There's no truth written in the message bottles or Onee‐chan's diary, just a fairy tale with a witch walking around.`
` ......I'm stuck."`
`"Looks like you're just going to have to bank on what you can get out of the relevant people on Niijima."`
`"I imagine the Witch Hunters have subjected them to endless questioning, so I'm pretty sure I won't find any new facts."`
`"Hehhaha...!`
` So even though your hopes are that low, you're willing to spend a half‐day trip on a boat to go to Niijima anyway! You really are fickle."`
`".........It's like a journey of self‐satisfaction, so that I can say "I investigated".`
` I'm not so naive as to seriously think that I can unlock the truth of twelve years ago."`
`"When you've finished with your self‐satisfaction, what do you plan to do?"`
`"Who knows.`
` Haven't thought about it.`
` .........I'll go to Niijima, ask some questions of people related to all this.`
` ...Then, after going to Rokkenjima in the end and leaving some flowers, my journey will be over."`
`.........Several days had already passed since this journey began.`
`After being told by {f:5:Bernkastel} on the roof of that building...`
`to search for the truth of twelve years ago, I left on a journey akin to trying to grasp a cloud.`
`At the time, I felt something mystical about it, and I remember feeling as if I might be able to grasp some kind of miracle at the end of this journey.`
`......But several days are enough to bring a person back down from that high.`
`As I stood on the roof of that skyscraper that day, my heart had nowhere left to go—it was completely dead.`
`......Wanting from the bottom of my heart to be released from the cage of my body and rise into the sky,`
` ......I crossed the fence in order to die.`
`Maybe experiencing the desire to die and actually stepping forwards, throwing my body down...`
`caused some kind of mystical experience inside my head, making me think I had received a message from a witch.`
`.........The more the excitement from jumping down lessened over time, and the more I came back to my senses, the more this journey lost its meaning.`
`But I'd never considered suspending this journey just because of that.`
`If I stopped this journey, it would mean acknowledging that the message from that witch was an illusion.`
`And I felt as if that meant throwing away the promise the witch had made,`
` and any chance that someone from my family might come back.`
`So, I'm continuing this journey because I want to believe in that illusion.`
`I don't seriously believe that this journey will change anything.`
`{n}......I'm even free to end it at any time.`
` It's up to me to choose where the final destination is.`
`In the end, this journey is only for my personal self‐satisfaction......`
`"............Self‐satisfaction, is it.`
` It sounds bad when you say it out loud, but I think that actually, that's life."`
`"......Heh.`
` If that's the answer you reached after crawling across the line between life and death in the mercenary business, that's probably pretty deep."`
`"Don't just laugh it off.`
` What I'm trying to say is that there's no {i:self} about it—in this world, the only one {i:capable} of satisfying you is yourself."`
`Amakusa continued stretching as he spoke.`
`{n}In an annoyingly eloquent way.`
`Hearing it told to me as though from a teacher made me instinctively want to resist, but what he was saying was extremely sensible.`
`".....................`
` ......That may be true."`
`"People work hard when they want to satisfy someone.`
` ......In most cases, that someone is their parents.`
` Children learn how to work hard because they want to be praised by their parents.`
` .........Of course, that's why I never learned."`
`"Sorry, that's not what I intended to say."`
`"......What I want to say is that self‐satisfaction is {nobr:A‐OK}.`
` No matter who praises you, it's meaningless unless you yourself are satisfied.`
` ......Turning it around, even if no one praises you, that doesn't matter as long as you're satisfied yourself."`
`".........Self‐satisfaction and self‐improvement contradict each other, so we're usually taught that the former is bad.`
` Your argument is kind of a breath of fresh air."`
`"The anguish of the human world comes when you want to satisfy someone, you want recognition, but you don't know where to put the effort.`
` I had a time like that too."`
`"I wanted recognition, but I didn't know what I wanted recognition {i:for}.`
` And since I didn't know what I was meant to put effort into, or how much, or even who I wanted to give me that recognition,`
` I did a lot of crazy things."`
`"And the answer you reached......was self‐satisfaction?"`
`"It sounds bad, but that's how it is.`
` Rich is the one who is content with what they are, they say."`
`".........If I've decided this is the life I'm happy with, no one has any right to tell me any different.`
` It's the same for your life, and for this journey.`
` No one has any right to object other than you yourself."`
`"You are the only one who determines the meaning and worth of your journey.`
` If it turns out to have been a meaningful journey for you, then that's more than enough."`
`"...........................`
` .........I thought you were the kind of guy who never takes things seriously, but you really do say some weird things every once in a while.`
` I'll bet you think saying things like that every now and then will make you a hit with the ladies."`
`"You've got me all wrong.`
` That's not why I said it.`
` .........It looks like you want to be alone.`
` I'll be over with the boat captain.`
` Please, take your time."`
`It seemed Amakusa had decided I was in a bad mood.`
`{n}......Although I didn't feel that way myself.`
`Maybe he had just finished a set of stretches and wanted to cool off in the shade.`
`The sea winds were strong, but not enough to take the edge off the rays of the sun.`
`Amakusa disappeared.`
` Only I remained.`
`".........Self‐satisfaction is life, he says."`
`"That's just boring.`
` Life is nothing without greed."`
`I noticed that Mammon had suddenly appeared, her full hair streaming out in the wind by the prow of the ship.`
`"It's true that a life of greed would be fun.`
` But unlike you, {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s have a limited lifespan."`
`"If a person remains greedy for eternity, that means that they have desires even in the last moment before they die.`
` Having desires means that there's something they want.`
` Something they don't have, some way they aren't complete."`
`"......I'm sure it's tough to die when you can't think of yourself as being fulfilled.`
` So I'm sure self‐satisfaction is actually necessary."`
`".........I see.`
` Then beings with lifespans need to make that kind of compromise?`
` Our masters always had very long lifespans, so I've never thought of it."`
`"I wonder if {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s live so that they can be satisfied.`
` ......If so, to seek nothing is probably the easiest way to live.`
` ...Yes, it makes sense why greed is one of the seven deadly sins."`
`"*giggle*.`
` Your praise honors me."`
`Apparently that counted as praise in Mammon's eyes.`
`{n}She turned and gave a graceful curtsy.`
`"Ange‐sama.`
` Do {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s live so that they can be satisfied at the moment of their death?"`
`"......It must be pretty tough to be somehow incomplete at the moment of your death, right?"`
`"If so, then {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s live only so that they can have a satisfying death.`
` They live so that they can have a better death.`
` They live to die."`
`............Wow, that's a hell of a thing to say.`
`{n}...Yes, I should have expected that from a demon stake.`
`However, her words might be the truth.`
` Humans suffer because they aren't whole, and live only to be made whole.`
`That might be the same, in other words, as a desire to die—to die while whole.`
`"I have no argument against that.`
` ......People live in order to be content.`
` And they hope to die while still content.`
` So, not knowing how to make yourself content, make yourself complete, is very tough."`
`"How does a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} do that?`
` Make their life complete."`
`".........Receiving validation, acceptance.`
` That they're happy."`
`"If it doesn't matter who accepts you, then I'll do it myself, if you like."`
`"Yes, that's just it.`
` .........People don't know whose acceptance they need."`
`"So, searching for that person to accept them is the journey of life?`
` Hmmmm."`
`"It sounds strange, doesn't it?`
` Whether you find acceptance or not, it shouldn't change your circumstances.`
` ......And yet, if you find acceptance you'll be whole, and if you don't then you won't."`
`"...It's almost like the blue bird.`
` ......Even though the blue bird is already in the cage, you can't notice it, so you have to go out on a journey searching everywhere."`
`"What the heck.`
` Kyahhahaha.`
` Human lives sure are stupid."`
`"That's right.`
` Amakusa really hit on something.`
` ......Rich is the one who is content with what they are...was it?`
` I don't know where that proverb came from, but it's deep."`
`"......In short, if you won't be fully content unless you have someone's acceptance, that's the same as not being able to accept yourself.`
` ......Turns out the ultimate self‐fulfillment begins with self‐acceptance."`
`"Well, of course.`
` Because if you can become aware that you're fulfilled, there's no need for anyone else's acceptance.`
` Just by taking notice of that small little thing, a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}'s foolish lifelong journey can be ended easily."`
`"Then they can spend the rest of their life effectively, playing and having a good time.`
` A {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}'s life is so ridiculous, kyahhahahaha!"`
`Mammon's choice of words was bad, but it was surely the truth.`
`If most of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}'s life...`
`is a journey wishing for someone's acceptance so that they can achieve a satisfied death...`
`.........then the moment they realize that the person to accept them is not someone else, but them themselves, they can end that pointless journey.`
`Humans who have finished that journey can probably spend the rest of their lives as they wish with their heads held high.`
`......How sublime, how praiseworthy would that be.`
`"You know,`
` it seems Amakusa's on pretty bad terms with his parents.`
` ......Makes sense, right?`
` Amakusa's in the kind of trade that any sane parent would want their kid to wash his hands of."`
`"Why does it matter?`
` If he's enjoying it."`
`".........Exactly.`
` That's what it comes down to in the end.`
` Your worth as observed by others doesn't matter."`
`"If your existence is firmly accepted by you yourself, that's enough.`
` ......If you can live with confidence in yourself, surely you can accept and find satisfaction in any kind of lifestyle."`
`"I'm sure Amakusa will eventually eat a stray bullet on the battlefield and get seriously injured.`
` ...He might even die."`
`"But I don't think Amakusa will think of it as unfair.`
` I'm sure he'd cackle about how that too is life."`
`"What a great way to live.`
` I'm enchanted."`
`"......Pitiful {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s who can't accept themselves...`
`wander about searching for it their whole lives, doing nothing but grumbling and complaining, unable to come to terms with anything, ultimately dying while still unfulfilled."`
`"......How pitiful.`
` Compared to people whose lives drag on without any purpose,`
` Amakusa is more likely to eventually die by the roadside, but I think he's much more noble for living his life with his chest stuck out."`
`"Maybe the enlightened are the winners in life?`
` If you can come to that realization even a little sooner, you'll be able to put that much more of your life to good use."`
`.........At those words of Mammon's,`
` ......I finally came to terms with a certain fact.`
`I had......described her as an abnormal kid, a little strange.`
`However,`
` ......that wasn't the case.`
`She had simply...`
`......finished that journey faster than anyone else, and taught herself to keep her own chin up and live with confidence.`
`".....................Maybe {i:that's} what made Maria onee‐chan...so amazing.`
` She had already reached that point at the age where she was only just about to begin elementary school."`
`Other people like us, looking at her life from the outside, couldn't call it happy by any standard.`
`But even though such days were engraved in her diary,`
` ......the entries always finished up by saying it was a happy day.`
`Even though you can catch glimpses of her mother's lack of love for her,`
` in spite of that, she believed that her mother did love her.`
`The mother's love that didn't exist, she created herself, filling her world with love.`
`Others observed her as an unfulfilled, pitiful girl,`
` ......but she told herself that she was fulfilled, and accepted herself how she was.`
`And so, she was happy that way.`
`It's easy to observe that as something pitiable and sad.`
` But to her, that was an outsider's opinion, and didn't matter in the slightest.`
`The only important thing was whether or not this was happiness {i:to her}.`
`It's just like how, when people who live in the city point to the lifestyles of those in the country,`
` and lament the inconvenience and feel sympathy for them, it's really just misplaced kindness.`
`If those who live there are satisfied with what they have, that's more than enough.`
`".........I've finally realized something.`
` ...I realized it just now.`
` ......I did something horrible to Maria onee‐chan.`
` .........And to all of you, and Sakutarou as well, on that day."`
`"................................."`
`"The question of whether magic exists, or not.`
` ......That's not up to other people to decide."`
`"It's up to you yourself.`
` Whether magic exists to Maria onee‐chan is a problem for Maria onee‐chan to decide, and not for me."`
`"......And yet, when I was young, I said it, that day.`
` I told her there's no way magic exists, ......and I hurt her."`
`To me, magic doesn't exist—but that's {i:my} world.`
`{n}Denying Onee‐chan's world as well just because of that was totally barking up the wrong tree.`
`"Mariage Sorcière is the witches' alliance Maria onee‐chan created.`
` I was invited into that, and invited to become a witch with her."`
`"I thought it was a fun new game, and I went along with it for a while.`
` ......But, because of the cruelty of youth,`
` I got tired of it half‐way through.`
` And then......with sharp words, I tore her pure and innocent heart apart."`
`"......At that time, we must have gotten into a huge fight.`
` I forgot about it right away, but it was unforgettable for her.`
` ......After all, to her, magic was a natural power that emphatically existed,`
` and she believed that she'd be able to share that with me."`
`"......Magic, to Maria onee‐chan,`
` was a power by which she could give the world a happy interpretation, ......no, which could {i:make} everything happy—it truly was a magical power.`
` She just wanted to share that with me too."`
`"The young me tore those feelings apart.`
` ......So she closed herself up in a shell, believing that no one could understand magic with her."`
`".........If so, then Lady {f:5:Maria}'s life‐journey wasn't over after all.`
` If she had accepted herself, there would be no need for her to feel down just because you denied her."`
`"Onee‐chan was young.`
` She still hadn't reached the same kind of philosophical viewpoint as Amakusa.`
` ......Ahh, and that explains it perfectly.`
` Why the witches' alliance called Mariage Sorcière was necessary."`
`{m:-5:―}―An alliance where each accepts that the other is a witch.`
`"...That's right—I'm pretty sure that was the first article in the agreement of Mariage Sorcière.`
` ......Witches of the alliance must accept each other and respect each other.`
` That is the deepest and the only meaning of the witches' alliance......"`
`Maria onee‐chan wanted to share with me the secret laws for making the world happy, called magic.`
`But I was young.`
` And she was too.`
`......I hurt her with innocent cruelty.`
`".........On that day, I said it, ...those reckless words.`
` To all of you and Sakutarou.`
` I said there's no way you exist."`
`"I'm offended.`
` We accept that we exist ourselves.`
` We're not like {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, with their souls half‐asleep.`
` ......‘I think, therefore I am’."`
`"Whether you accept or deny magic, the existence of the magic called the Seven Stakes of Purgatory...is therefore a fact.`
` ......As long as we accept ourselves, to borrow your words."`
`"It truly would be violence for another person like me to deny that.`
` .........I'm sure that would be like having your true mother yell "I wish you had never been born",`
` no, "get out of my life"."`
`......Even after being slammed by all those words,`
` ......Maria onee‐chan's magic...`
`......made her believe in her mother's love.`
`Sakutarou, her magic friend, always encouraged her.`
`......He kept saying that her mother loved her, that she was coming home late because of her work,`
` and that she would definitely bring back a present.`
`Even after Maria learned the fact that it really wasn't because of work, magic still kept her believing that.`
`So by believing that her mother loved her, by accepting herself,`
` she filled her world with love and peace and serenity, ......and established it perfectly.`
`"What happened twelve years ago, ...what happened to my family.`
` ......This was...not a journey to search for that."`
`"............Then what is this journey?"`
`"It was a journey......to apologize to Maria onee‐chan for what happened that day."`
`".............................."`
`"I don't know why, but that's what I think.`
` ......If I hadn't hurt her that day,`
` .........the incident twelve years ago might not have occurred.`
` ......That's what I think."`
`I have no basis for it.`
` I don't have a clue how hurting Onee‐chan would be connected to that mysterious incident several years later.`
`But for some reason, I can't imagine that there is no connection.`
`A witch caused that incident.`
`And the culprit is the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`And {f:5:Beatrice} was part of the Mariage Sorcière Alliance of Witches.`
`I had horribly hurt the other witch of that alliance.`
`I had hurt her by saying that magic doesn't exist.`
`.........And that's why, several years later, an inexplicable crime by a witch occurred,`
` and that two‐day period which can't be explained with anything but magic was thrust in my face via a message bottle.`
`"......I'm sure that I'm not unrelated.`
` .........I don't know.`
` It could be chance, it could be fate.`
` .........For some reason, I've just started thinking that way on this journey."`
`"And your basis?"`
`"None.`
` It's just what I'm thinking."`
`"Hmmmm......`
` The Japanese sure are interesting.`
` Even if they're the victim, they feel as though they did something wrong, and apologize for no reason."`
`"......I could understand if you said "I hate {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama for stealing my family!" or something,`
` but you really are an odd one, feeling guilty for no reason and apologizing."`
`"Of course I hate {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I couldn't continue this journey without that feeling."`
`"But it's alright for me to find another purpose to this journey.`
` There's nothing wrong with me adding the goal of apologizing for past sins onto this journey for revenge on a witch of twelve years prior.`
` I can at least go to Rokkenjima, apologize for my reckless remarks, and offer flowers."`
`"......No, .........there's something better than flowers.`
` And I think that would be more fitting for Onee‐chan."`
`I stood up, and, ignoring my hair being blown about by the sea breeze, I concentrated my mind......`
`I lifted my palms up to the height of my head, ......and imagined a vast space......`
`"............Ange‐sama..............."`
`"......Quiet.`
` ........................"`
`"......Come, arise.`
` ......I am the witch apprentice, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}.`
` ......Though I was excommunicated, I was once a member of the same alliance, and you are dearly missed furniture who played with me.`
` Answer to my call........."`
`It was hard to tell in the middle of the day, but a faint blue light gathered around the palms of my hands.`
`.........Then,`
` .........I revived Sakutarou's form.`
`It truly was long‐missed, that figure.`
`His cute ears, his bright‐red scarf.`
`......It came off easily, so Onee‐chan faithfully re‐wrapped it all the time, didn't she...`
`"......Sakutaro......`
` ......Recognize us?`
` Do you know who we are...?"`
`‘...Uryu......?`
` Uryu......?`
` Mammon...?`
` Ange.........?’`
`With a sleepy face, as though waking up from a long slumber, Sakutarou looked all around him as he spoke.`
`"It's been a long time, ......Sakutarou.`
` I'm pretty sure this is the first time I've summoned you with my own power.`
` ......And now, I'm the only one who can."`
`‘..................Uryu......’`
`Those words might have been a bit cruel.`
`{n}Sakutarou's face clouded over...`
`"In the past, I denied you.`
` .........Now that I have summoned you,`
` ......that means that I have accepted your existence."`
`‘.........Is it okay......?`
` Is it okay...for me to be summoned into your world......?’`
`His eyes were slightly frightened.`
`......It was only natural.`
` I, who had played with him like a friend before,`
` had one day suddenly denied him and tried to burn him with the anti‐magic toxin.`
`It was only natural that he was scared......`
`"I apologize.`
` For that day.`
` .........To you too, Mammon.`
` And to the rest of you."`
`At some point, ......the rest of the Seven Sisters had gathered on the deck.`
`No, they are there at all times.`
` Always by my side.`
`As long as I accept that it's okay for them to be there, they will appear anytime.`
`"You certainly do exist.`
` Lucifer.`
` And Leviathan.`
` And Satan.`
` And Belphegor.`
` And Mammon.`
` And Beelzebub.`
` And Asmodeus.`
` ......And Sakutarou too."`
`"......Is that alright?`
` Ange‐sama, you are one who is challenging {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` ...Is it alright for one in a position of denying witches to accept us?"`
`"About whether magic exists or not in my world, sorry, but let me put that question on hold.`
` It's not like I myself have accepted the existence of magic."`
`"......Yet you accept us? How do you explain that contradiction?"`
`"Because magic exists for people who believe.`
` Even if I don't.`
` If someone believes, then magic will exist in that person's world."`
`"That will not be interfered with in any way, whether I believe in magic or not.`
` No, it must not be interfered with."`
`"That person just needs to hold their head up high and believe in their own magic.`
` And I will accept that.`
` So it isn't strange at all for you guys to exist."`
`".........That's quite the rationalization...but, an interesting interpretation, I would say."`
`"What you're saying, Ange‐sama, is probably a Devil's Proof."`
`"A Devil's Proof......?"`
`"After all!`
` To prove the existence of demons, you just need to bring one with you..."`
`"But denying the existence of demons is impossible!"`
`"Kyahha!`
` And we are here.`
` That means that whether Ange‐sama believes in magic or not, our existence is unshakable."`
`‘......Uryu?`
` The anti‐magic toxin...`
`.........is disappearing...`
`...from Ange......’`
`"Y‐you're right......`
` ......But she's in a position of denying magic......so why......?"`
`"That's probably......`
`......because I learned respect and acceptance.`
` Now, ......I might be able to understand...`
`...the depths of Maria onee‐chan's magic......and {f:5:Beatrice}'s."`
`In the past, I insisted that I didn't believe in things like magic,`
` that something like that couldn't exist—I acted like I had my eyes tightly shut and couldn't see anything.`
`But now I'm different.`
` I get the feeling I can look right at the thing called magic, and close in on its true nature......`
`"......How frustrating.`
` It's truly rare to find a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} so free of the anti‐magic toxin in this day and age.`
` And she has such an uncommon genius for being a witch..."`
`"That's right.`
` ......If Ange‐sama tried to become a witch now,`
` ......she could grow to be a Great Witch, maybe even at {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's level."`
`"Even so, she is our master, and has accepted our existence.`
` ......Most likely, Ange‐sama will be our final master.`
` Let us think of this as our final service, and apply ourselves to the fullest."`
`"......Bleghh.`
` I just can't sta~nd that Ange‐sama still doesn't believe in magic herself."`
`"......Ange‐samaaa, please believe in magic too~.`
` Feels like a waste to finally have a master and have it not be a wi~tch."`
`"Even though you have outstanding talent which could make you one of the greatest of witches, your goal is to slay them.`
` It's such a shame."`
`"......Well, that's her life, her way of living,`
` and if that's the way she's decided her world is going to be, there's nothing we can achieve by complaining."`
`"Thanks for understanding me.`
` Yeah, whether magic exists {i:to me} or not,`
` that's up to me to decide.`
` Whether magic actually does exist somewhere in the world or not, you see?"`
`When I think about it, the world is so vast, ......and yet so small.`
`Billions of people live on the Earth.`
`{n}But I probably won't meet even one percent of those people.`
`Even so, I will speak of the world.`
`{n}Without knowing even one percent of the world—I will speak of "my world".`
`"I'm not qualified to deny the laws of a world I don't know.`
` ......So just because magic doesn't exist in my world, I can't deny that magic exists in a world I don't know."`
`"That makes it a true Devil's Proof.`
` No, maybe it's more like "when in Rome, do as the Romans do"."`
`I can be confident in the world I know.`
` So even if my world {i:is} denied by a complete stranger who doesn't know a thing about it, that's nothing to worry about.`
`And in the same way, just because I don't know another world,`
` that doesn't make me qualified to deny it.`
`"Which is why,`
` regardless of whether there is magic in my world or not,`
` ......I cannot deny the magic Maria onee‐chan taught me."`
`‘Uryu!`
` After all, even if you've never seen it,`
` ......magic exists!’`
`"Yes.`
` That's why, as I've already said,`
` ......your existence, as friends of the Mariage Sorcière Alliance of Witches,`
` cannot be denied by me or anyone else."`
`I proclaimed the most important part again.`
`............Even though the sea breeze and the crashing of the waves were noisy, it was a time of silence.`
`Both Sakutarou and the Seven Sisters of Purgatory......reflected upon my words.`
`And, probably, I did too.`
`Does magic exist or not—`
`{n}Do witches exist or not—`
`I reflected on the fact that, while ignoring what the answer was within my world, ......I had declared openly that I would accept their existence, despite it being a contradiction.`
`‘Thank you, ......Ange.’`
`"If you will accept that much, perhaps one day, witches could also—`
` ...No, that was a foolish question.`
` You already have a clear answer to that question."`
`"Sorry.`
` I do accept that witches might exist somewhere in this world.`
` But {i:my} world will not waver."`
`"......You won't accept witches or magic.`
` You'll definitely expose the truth of Rokkenjima.`
` ......Right?"`
`"Yes.`
` That is my world.`
` Even if a witch really does exist, I won't accept her in my world.`
` No matter how much that witch tries to court me."`
`"Your position is to slay witches.`
` ......And I now understand well that you have not the slightest wavering in that feeling!"`
`"We are your furniture, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory...!`
` We will always be by your side.`
` We will always be waiting for the day that we can be useful...!"`
`"Although, since you don't believe in magic, we can never be anything more than someone to talk to."`
`"That's enough for now.`
` We've been left room to exist.`
` For that alone, we should thank and accept Ange‐sama."`
`"In short!`
` All of uuuuus..."`
`‘Can be together again......`
` Uryuu!!’`
`"Kyaaah!!`
` Sakutaroo!`
` Let me fluffle youuuuuuuuu~!!"`
`As Sakutarou was overcome with emotion and tears came to his eyes, the Seven Sisters closed in and mobbed him.`
`......They were also celebrating a long‐awaited reunion.`
`Because they were granted permission to exist, they can exist here without doubt.`
`No—they can exist even if I don't permit it.`
`Because I accepted them, they {i:showed} their reunion's joy {i:to me as well}.`
`As I watched over that scene, .........I reflected on the meaning of this journey of mine.`
`".........I wonder if everyone will forgive me this way."`
`"You've done enough.`
` We are furniture.`
` Just being summoned,`
` just being allowed to be by your side makes us happy."`
`‘Uryu...!`
` Ange, thank you very much......!’`
`"......Come to think of it, why was I able to summon Sakutarou?`
` ......No, it's the other way around.`
` Why wasn't Onee‐chan able to summon Sakutarou?"`
`Maria onee‐chan had despaired, thinking that Sakutarou had died.`
`Which told me that she hadn't been able to summon him like this anymore.`
`In the past, Onee‐chan said it was more advantageous in a summoning to have a vessel.`
`However, a vessel is like training wheels, and it shouldn't be absolutely necessary.`
`......In other words, even if the stuffed animal lion that was Sakutarou's vessel didn't exist, it should have been possible to summon him.`
`......In fact, for that matter,`
` it's a little doubtful whether summoned beings even have the concept of life and death.`
`Moreover, Sakutarou was an especially important friend to Maria onee‐chan.`
`She should have been able to strive hard to summon him one more time.`
`It certainly was sad that the original stuffed animal vessel had been torn apart,`
` but why was he "dead", and why couldn't she summon him again......?`
`‘...That's because...`
`at that time, Maria saw my stuffed animal get torn,`
` and she {i:decided}`
` that I had died.’`
`"It's the same as the existence of magic.`
` ......If, in Lady {f:5:Maria}'s world, it becomes a fact that Sakutarou died,`
` then Sakutarou cannot exist in her world."`
`‘............Uryu......’`
`The shock of having her beloved stuffed animal torn apart...`
`had left a wound in her heart serious enough to prevent her from ever again summoning her irreplaceable close friend.`
`{i:In Maria onee‐chan's eyes}, Sakutarou had died.`
`So even if Sakutarou could exist like this to me, he could not exist before her.`
`‘I......was always together with Maria......`
` ......As she cried, I was there the whole time right beside her, telling her not to cry......`
` ......But my form, my voice, ......nothing of me would reach her......’`
`Sakutarou hung his head, looking sad.`
`"......After that incident, the nature of Mariage Sorcière rapidly began to change.`
` Before then, the alliance was a peaceful thing."`
`"But after the incident, it grew full of shadier things, focusing on how to curse people you hate.`
` ......Onee‐chan's diary began to show a clear change."`
`A diary is a mirror that reflects one's heart as it is.`
`It probably showed the personality called Maria die,`
` and be reborn as the evil witch personality {f:5:Maria}.`
`As she filled the diary with hatred and sadness, ......her heart surely was not fulfilled.`
`Because she wasn't fulfilled, she had no choice but to fill it with hatred and sadness.`
`And while still unfulfilled, she met with death.`
`......I wonder if her unfulfilled soul has a hole opened in its chest from sadness even now,`
` and continually wanders, tears dripping down and calling Sakutarou's name......`
`.................................`
`"...............You......are needed by Onee‐chan."`
`‘Uryu.........’`
`"What can I do to revive you in Maria onee‐chan's world?`
` If I can learn how to do that, I'll be able to save Onee‐chan.`
` ......That is the method of atonement I am tasked with.`
` What can be done to revive you?"`
`‘......My vessel had a very important meaning to Maria......’`
`"The vessel.`
` ......So, if we could revive the lion stuffed animal..."`
`‘But......`
` ......Mama Rosa made my stuffed animal herself, so only Mama Rosa can make it......’`
`Even inside the diary, Maria onee‐chan had asked this of {f:5:Beatrice}, and had been refused for the same reason.`
`The magical significance of a stuffed animal being unique and handmade is very large.`
`Then, if we could make the same thing once more......`
`But Aunt Rosa is already gone from this world.`
`{n}We can never make the same thing again.`
`"......Was there ever another identical stuffed animal made, or anything like that?"`
`"He is a stuffed animal made for Lady {f:5:Maria}'s birthday present, and is the only one in the world.`
` ......A handmade and unique vessel.`
` That's why it conceals a great magical power."`
`"And......if lost, it will never be obtained again.`
` It will not revive..."`
`‘.........Uryu.........’`
`......Maria onee‐chan knew that,`
` so when she saw that stuffed animal, unique in the world, be torn apart,`
` .........she despaired.`
`Because it was a stuffed animal unique in the world,`
` and it permitted her no compromises such as simply buying another, ......she despaired from the bottom of her heart......`
`"......But Sakutarou is right here.`
` Even without a vessel, he's here.`
` I accept that, and so he firmly exists in my world."`
`".........Even if Maria onee‐chan doesn't accept him, that fact cannot be denied.`
` Right...?"`
`"Logically, that's true,`
` ......but I think using the same logic to make Lady {f:5:Maria} accept him could be difficult."`
`‘......Maria.........`
` ......I'm not dead...`
` I'm right here.........`
` ......Uryu......’`
`"I'm sure that on Rokkenjima,`
` ......I'll be able to be reunited with Maria onee‐chan.`
` And, ......no matter what, I'm going to revive you inside Onee‐chan, and let you be reunited too."`
`‘Can you do that......?’`
`"It will probably be hard.`
` ......Just like how, after being invited into the witches' alliance, I rejected it without understanding what it meant,`
` she might also reject your existence."`
`".........But I've got to do it.`
` That's the only way I can atone for my sins."`
`"............Ange‐sama......"`
`"What is waiting on Rokkenjima?`
` And what will happen, what will I be able to achieve?`
` ......Although maybe nothing will happen at all."`
`‘........................’`
`"That island, which was the beginning of everything, will be the final destination of this journey.`
` .........As your master, I must bring all of you witch's furniture with me...`
`...and {i:I must return} to the witch's island—to Rokkenjima."`
`Even though the rays of the sun had been so strong, at some point clouds had started to hang over us.`
`The spray hitting my cheek might not all be coming from the crashing waves.`
`"Ange‐san.`
` It looks like a light shower is coming.`
` Shouldn't you be going down?"`
`Amakusa called out to me, with an expression of surprise that I was still here.`
`When I looked up, I saw that the island's silhouette had gotten much larger.`
`{n}We might reach land very soon.`
`I remembered that the weather report had mentioned scattered rains.`
`The sky wasn't dark enough for rain clouds.`
`{n}It'll probably be just for a short time.`
`Even if the rain was light enough not to be a bother,`
` ......having rain start to fall as we approached the island felt like some kind of fate.`
`It was probably raining on October 4th, 1986, as well.`
`{n}I was approaching the Rokkenjima of that day, ......and not just in distance......`
`I went back down with Amakusa.`
`Amakusa was carrying what looked like a quite large and heavy golf bag.`
`It was something Amakusa had brought back from god‐knows‐where after we split up for a day.`
`{n}......I wasn't going to inquire as to its contents, but it's hard to imagine that they're anything peaceful.`
`".........I'm deliberately not going to ask what's inside, but it looks heavy."`
`"Why is it that these are so heavy?`
` A French instructor taught me something interesting about that once."`
`"He said that they {i:should} be heavy.`
` .........After all, a human life is heavier than the Earth.`
` So these should be even heavier."`
`".........It'll be nice if you don't have a chance to use them."`
`"That would be nice."`
`Amakusa set the golf‐bag‐like luggage down heavily beside him.`
`A two‐propeller aircraft touched down on the runway.`
`{n}With the weather in these conditions, it could not have been a pleasant flight.`
`{n}Everything after this flight had been suspended due to the weather.`
`Cutting through the drizzle as she traversed the runway, Sumadera Kasumi entered the lobby with two black‐suits as guards.`
`The four black‐suits who had been waiting inside the lobby stood up and respectfully lowered their heads.`
`"""Kasumi‐sama...!"""`
`"Propeller planes do shake awfully, don't they......`
` I never want to fly in one again."`
`"We have a car prepared!`
` Please, this way."`
`They went into two luxury cars that had been rented...`
`"......Ange should be heading for Rokkenjima.`
` A deserted island—how truly convenient.`
` .........You have prepared the tools, I hope?"`
`"Yes, ma'am......!"`
`The black‐suit in the passenger seat lifted a heavy bag that had been by his feet onto his lap,`
` opened the zipper wide, and showed Kasumi the contents.`
`Inside were several blocky objects wrapped tightly in silver aluminum foil.`
`......He peeled one open to show her.`
`Out peeked a black, blunt, automatic pistol......`
