`Scattered over the big bed were cute jellybeans of various colors,`
` and chocolate coins.`
`A fork was stuck into the shortcake peeking out of a gift box,`
` and there were decanters with drinks of various colors lined up on the side table.`
`But the venomous color of the drink poured into the glass matched none of the decanters.`
`Someone had probably been playing around, mixing them together.`
`The taste aside, that was a lot of fun to do.`
`On top of the fluffy bed were several colorful, big pillows stuffed with dreams.`
`And on this big bed that looked like something out of a child's dream world,`
` {f:5:Bernkastel} lay face down,`
` and {f:5:Lambdadelta} lay face up, hugging a pillow and relaxing......`
`"Ahahhahahhahhah, this one was a real rush, wasn't it?`
` I got re~ally anxious when Beato said she'd stop the game."`
`".....................What a rude witch, to start a game of this scale and try to end it by throwing it away."`
`"Wasn't Ange a good piece?`
` After Beato ran for it, Ange dragged her back and made her resume the game.`
` It's too bad that she gave Battler a bit too much enthusiasm, though."`
`"..................Because she knew Battler is weak against emotions."`
`"No kidding.`
` He looked like he might even go easy on his enemy Beato."`
`"............Based on the previous game, I was uneasy that he might start to feel compassion for Beato, and take the game in an odd direction.`
` .........Ange was a trump card to get Battler back on track if and when he mistook his goal."`
`".........In truth, I wanted to have her support him a bit more before playing her out.`
` She really did play and discard herself straight away.`
` What a waste for a piece that required so much preparation."`
`"Ehheheheh!`
` I'm so~ glad I shackled her with the rule about not giving her name!`
` If I hadn't set that up, the brother‐sister tag team would have swallowed Beato up and won in the blink of an eye."`
`"............I thought it was my chance to apply a lot of pressure at once,`
` but you were watching her so closely that I couldn't make the best use of her.`
` ......Aaah, what a waste that piece was."`
`"Well, yeah? That piece was super OP, I needed her out of there, like, yesterday.`
` Well, in the end, she did a good job of preventing the game from being suspended, I guess, and that helps me out too.`
` Her actions ended up matching both of our interests, so in that sense, she really was a wonderful piece."`
`"..................She was an innocent kid like Battler, so it was easy to get her to do as I said.`
` .........An idiot or an impulsive type, one of those two is always best for a piece.`
` ......Aaah, that piece really could have been so much more."`
`"And now she's mincemeat!`
` Hey, let's make hamburgers out of that later on{p:0:☆}`
` Oh wait, didn't you like gyoza more?`
` I wonder what little sister tastes like, *giggle*, so funny!"`
`"..................Is it really alright for you to be so relaxed?`
` Battler got fired up thanks to Ange.`
` He started going after Beato like a madman, and now, the game has taken a big turn to my advantage, I'd say...?`
` In fact, didn't Battler just solve almost all of the mysteries so far?"`
`"Huuh?`
` Not even clo~se!`
` Almost all of Battler's blue truth is wrong!`
` Beato's wishy‐washy red is full of holes.`
` Anyone with half a brain could slip through it easily just by rattling off some random BS."`
`"......Ahhh, that really ticked me off.`
` If that had been me, I'd have made sure to cut down every one of those things with the red."`
`"............Oh, really?`
` I was under the impression that those were all the correct answers.`
` ......Well, of course, I did have my suspicions about all that stuff to do with swallowing small bombs."`
`"And Battler's blue truths, not all of them were even valid.`
` ......Beato stated clearly that, within the first game, she`
` {p:1:guarantees the identities of all unidentified corpses}!`
` That breaks Battler's reasoning about the culprit of the Eva/Hideyoshi locked‐room murder being someone who used a fake corpse."`
`"Next, he said that Kanon's death in the boiler room was probably an accident, but...*giggle*!`
` What kind of accident could end up with him driving a stake into his own chest?`
` How dumb is that?`
` I'll slice it with that red treasured sword or whatever."`
`"{p:1:Kanon did not die in an accident}!`
` For the next one, the murders of the three including Genji in the parlor, the thought that it was a simultaneous murder where they shot each other in a clockwise pattern at the same time is laughable.`
` {p:1:Genji, Kumasawa, and Nanjo were not killers}!"`
`"The final trap X for Natsuhi's murder is really dumb, too.`
` {p:1:The thing that shot Natsuhi wasn't a trap, it was a real shooting murder with a gun raised and trigger pulled}!`
` *giggle*, my condolences...!"`
`"......Stop that.`
` You mustn't say something like that in red.`
` That kid's trying to make it so that she killed Natsuhi by bouncing Natsuhi's bullet back at her with magic."`
`"Oh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho, oopsie, you're right, I forgot...!`
` Even his blue truths for the second game were too naive."`
`"`
`{p:1:When the six were murdered in the chapel, the culprit was inside the chapel}!`
` That guy tries to explain every little thing with trap X.`
` What the heck is trap X, some weird mystery novel cliché?"`
`"And in the incident where Nanjo and Kumasawa were killed in the servant room, it's ludicrous to say that someone inherited Kanon's name.`
` {p:1:The only one who can go by the name of Kanon is the person himself}!`
` {p:1:No other human can adopt that name}!"`
`"And that theory about borrowing the master key from Rosa for Natsuhi's room is also worthless!"`
`"{p:1:After the master keys came into Rosa's control, never did any of them leave her hands}!`
` {p:1:Except for the time when she lent one to Battler to unlock Natsuhi's room}.`
` I could go on, but this is enough just for a quick look, I guess?"`
`"............A quick look? You've just denied Battler's blue truth for the first and second games across the board.`
` .........My, my, what a thing.`
` Battler would faint if he heard that."`
`"......See?`
` Beato wasn't cornered at all.`
` .........I always thought she was a pretty good actress."`
`"I'm sure the plan is to make it look like she got cornered this game,`
` and then sometime next game, swish!, she'll slice it in half with a single red stroke and make Battler's eyes pop out."`
`"*giggle*, and then I'm sure she'll say it with a huge grin on her face.`
` "A witch is never in trouble~"!`
` Pff, *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"...............Then that whole tragic feeling as though Beato was getting cornered was all an act?"`
`"Obviously?!`
` She really is a great actress!`
` Even though she wasn't cornered at all, it felt like a last‐episode climax to put everyone else to shame!"`
`"She's totally the winner for best supporting actress this year!!`
` Oh, but of course I'm the sta~r!`
` Or it could be you, Be~rn!"`
`"............At the end, she said things like "kill me" and laid out a big riddle.`
` Wasn't that her last stand, with Beato to be finished for good if that riddle was solved?"`
`"*giggle*giggle*...!`
` No way, you were tricked too, Bern?"`
`"That wasn't even close to a last stand!`
` Beato still has some hellishly brutal moves she's keeping hidden.`
` ......When she stuck out both arms to give the final riddle, did you notice how she brought her right arm back down?"`
`"......Ah, now that you mention it.`
` .........So that's what that meant."`
`"Sure is!`
` She still had plenty of hidden moves left!`
` And none of the mysteries have been solved...!"`
`"That tension, as though she'd been completely seen through and it was like "Tune in next time for the final episode!"`
` She truly is a genius at acting.`
` Ahh, I can't wait to see her knock Battler back down to rock bottom!"`
`"She's really taken to that "North Wind and the Sun Strategy" from the last game, I think!`
` I bet Battler will sympathize with Beato again and fall for it completely...!`
` A woman's single tear can trick a man, after all—now that's value, don't you think?!!"`
`"...............I wonder if Battler will get caught by that move again.`
` I must do my part too, and light a fire under Battler to never feel sympathy for her again.`
` ......Although Ange's mincemeat seems to have done that pretty well for the time being."`
`"A power‐up from an Ange‐flavored hamburger?`
` Oh‐hoho{0}ho{0}ho{0}ho{0}hoho!`
` Of course, I won't be beaten either.`
` I'll be giving Beato my full support so she can make enough of a comeback to compete with Battler."`
`"......She won't lose. Beato.`
` I mean, I've threatened her with a wonderful penalty if she does{p:0:♪}"`
`"..................Your penalties are genuinely no joke, so you should go a little easy."`
`"I've decided what to do next time I get to give you a penalty, Bern.`
` Wanna hear? Wanna hear?"`
`"No."`
`"Come o~~n, listen{p:0:☆}`
` Okay, here we go, here we go.`
` I'll lock you in a wonderful, wonderful castle."`
`"The castle will be surrounded by pure white castle walls, {nobr:12 km} to a side.`
` With a height of {nobr:10 m}.`
` No magic and no cheating allowed!`
` That's really not something you can jump over, right?"`
`"1,440,000,000 m³?`
` .........You can stop there, I already know what you're going to say."`
`"Eheheheheh!`
` And that place will start getting buried with gems, one every day!`
` And I'll lock you in it until the castle walls are packed with them, and you've been buried to death with gems.`
` Isn't that a wonderful, romantic penalty?"`
`"..................I'll let you multiply the length of the walls by five if you make the height one‐tenth its current height, and you can even shut me in it right now."`
`"Really?!`
` That would make it {nobr:3,600,000,000 m³}, you know?!`
` The penalty would take more than twice as long!`
` Aaahh, you'll be my prisoner for such a long time?!`
` I love you Bern, I really love yo~u{p:0:♪}"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} playfully clung to {f:5:Bernkastel}, who yawned, looking bored, as she stroked {f:5:Lambdadelta} under the chin as though playing with a cat...`
`"So you're betting on Battler to win.`
` And I'm betting on the two of them getting draws forever.`
` ............Isn't anyone going to bet on Beato to win?"`
`".....................It won't be me.`
` Her chances of winning are zero."`
`"Oh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!`
` It must hurt to be told by the Witch of Miracles that there's zero chance of a miracle!`
` I wouldn't bet on her either, of course.`
` For certain!"`
`".........It must hurt to be told by the Witch of Certainty that it's certainly no good, as well."`
`Unusually for them, they giggled together...`
`"I wonder what kind of conclusion this game's gonna have...?"`
`"...............Now that, at least, we can't predict.`
` ...That's why it's fun, after all."`
`"I won't allow any more escaping or suspending the game.`
` I'll make them continue the game for certain, and I won't let them run away...!`
` I can't even imagine how things are gonna unfold now,`
` but I do know one way it's certainly not going to end."`
`"..................At the very least, we know it won't end with Beato's victory."`
`"I mean, think about it.`
` Neither you nor I...`
`are betting on Beato to come out the winner!`
` Which means, if it looks like Beato is gonna win, she'll be making enemies of both of us Great Witches...!"`
`".........Pretty much.`
` Our powers are most in balance only when things are somewhere between a draw and Battler's advantage.`
` If it tips too much in Beato's favor, both of us will align along the same vector, and drag Beato back."`
`"So the instant Beato finds herself on top, ......she'll have both of us as enemies to deal with.`
` .........Ehheheheheh!`
` A common front with Bern, sounds fu~~n{p:0:♪}"`
`".........Thanks.`
` ......But I'm not taking a konpeitou candy bath with you."`
`"Aaa~w, but I thought we could take a konpeitou shower together,`
` while I cover you all over with melted marshmallows..."`
`".........That poor girl.`
` She's a living toy, a doll that you caught so that you could play with me."`
`"I'm good at playing with dolls.`
` ......I really can play with them well, you know?`
` I'm proud of being able to get hundreds of years of playtime out of a single toy without getting tired of it."`
`"............You're her ally at some times, and oppose her at others,`
` toying with her forever.`
` ......I feel sorry for her. That kid is our doll, now."`
`"Ehheheh, that's right, that kid is our doll.`
` No end is prepared for her except the ones the two of us wish for."`
`"So I can say for sure that this can only end with either an eternal draw because of me,`
` or Beato being defeated and destroyed because of you.`
` ............Heheh, ...as far as this game ending with Beato's victory goes..."`
`"...............I will proclaim it as the Witch of Miracles."`
`"Then I'll proclaim it as the Witch of Certainty."`
`""Beato certainly cannot win.`
` And there will be absolutely no miracles.""`
`""Ahhahahahahahahahahahahaha......!!""`
