`"Good day to you." `
`"......G-Good day to you." `
`'Good day to you' is the standard greeting used here. `
`No matter how many years pass by, this style of greeting still feels very awkward... `
`Even though I'd responded to the greeting in order to stifle that awkward feeling, `
`the classmate who had spoken looked at me blankly. `
`"...Huh? `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*" `
`"Huuuh, what's that? `
`It seems you're mistaken, *giggle*giggle*..." `
`Their choice of words and manner were certainly what you'd expect from a school for rich girls, `
`but the actual meaning was as innocent and cruel as you'd expect from kids of that age. `
`...It seems they found it funny that I'd mistakenly thought the greeting was directed at me. `
`No, it might be the opposite. `
`...Maybe they didn't know how to react after being suddenly greeted by a gloomy, quiet kid like me. `
`No, judging by the gazes of my classmates, who were looking this way over their shoulders and whispering to each other, `
`it looked as though some of them considered this refreshing morning ruined. `
`...I was...dark. `
`Because I was disliked. `
`So, trying not to get in the way of everyone's refreshing morning any more, I stooped lower and entered the classroom. `
`...Almost like I was cutting through the aisle in a movie theater while the movie was running. `
`This is an all-dorm school, Saint Lucia Academy. `
`It's not a school that anyone can get into by taking a test. `
`...It's a hidden rich girls' school, known of only by a select group of celebrities from various fields. `
`For lofty nobles who truly wish their daughters could be raised like saints, `
`this is probably the ideal school in which to protect them from the impurities of the common world. `
`...But at the same time, it was probably also convenient for nobles who wanted to confine daughters they didn't want out in public. `
`As well as an academy isolated from the impurities of the common world, it also held excellent potential as a prison school. `
`I was truly among the latter...and was confined in Saint Lucia Academy, `
`...forced to live my life in dreariness. `
`Of course, there weren't that many students like me, and you couldn't tell us apart at a glance. `
`However, even if we never fessed up about it, you could usually figure out who we were by watching how we acted. `
`...After all, we were always hanging our heads, with an expression on our faces as though the whole world had abandoned us. `
`Anyway, every class had one or two kids like that, so even if they didn't speak up about it, you could guess who they were. `
`Therefore. `
`Even though I never confessed that I was one of those kids, at some point, everyone in my class knew about it... `
`Just like how the seriousness of an injury becomes a sign of status in a hospital room, how noble a birth one had became a sign of status here. `
`Those girls who couldn't be acknowledged in public were probably nothing more than filth to the others. `
`They must've thought that getting involved with such students would dirty them as well. `
`When a rumor sprang up about a particular student, `
`those fastidious girls would grow cold and distant, chasing that student out of all social groups. `
`Thanks to that, I led a quiet school life like this, all by myself... `
`Well, that's only if hearing people whisper behind my back, finding my things lost or broken all the time, and having everyone pretend like they didn't know anything... `
`can be called a quiet school life. `
`Even this early in the morning, I must look worn out. `
`...I can almost understand why my other classmates, who had a refreshing morning, looked at my face and wanted to click their tongues. `
`Consciously trying to do as I should and avoid tainting my classmates' morning, I quietly took my seat. `
`...Then, unusually, someone came to talk to me. `
`It was the class leader. `
`"Good day to you, Ushiromiya-san. `
`...You seem to be in a bad mood this morning. `
`Were you able to get enough sleep?" `
`"......Is there some business you have with me?" `
`"You're the only one who has not submitted her questionnaire for the class presentation, Ushiromiya-san. `
`Did you forget that the deadline was yesterday?" `
`...I'm pretty sure I heard something about that last week. `
`But I'd thought that the questionnaire hadn't been passed out yet. `
`The details would be written there, so there shouldn't have been any need to remember them beforehand... `
`"...I wasn't given a questionnaire..." `
`"That can't be. `
`I believe the dormitory leader handed them out to everyone. `
`If you lost it, all you have to do is honestly say so." `
`"......I lost it. `
`I'll fill it in right now, so could you give me a sheet?" `
`Again. `
`...Either someone lost my sheet, or they intentionally didn't tell me about it. `
`But I have no way of knowing who was behind that. `
`In the end, treating it as though it was my own carelessness would settle everything more quickly... `
`"Once you've filled it out, drop it in the questionnaire box in the student council room yourself. `
`Our class is the only one that didn't get everyone's in by yesterday." `
`As I hung my head at the class leader's scolding, `
`I could hear the giggles and whispers of people watching, coming from no direction in particular... `
`Ushiromiya-san did it again. `
`She's just so careless. `
`She doesn't deserve to be in this school. `
`She has no dignity, and no manners either. `
`...Sorry girls, but I've dealt with much worse when it comes to unfair personal attacks. `
`As I froze my heart and let those arrows of ridicule pass by, I quickly filled out the questionnaire... `
`When I learned that Father and Mother and Onii-chan...and all the rest of my family had died, `
`I was at the house of my Grandpa on my mother's side. `
`The only survivor of the accident was...Ushiromiya Eva. `
`...Only Aunt Eva. `
`Even at the time, I hadn't really liked Aunt Eva. `
`At a glance, she would act kindly, `
`but even as young as I was, I could see that she was somehow making fun of Father and the rest, and I hadn't liked it. `
`So when it was decided that Aunt Eva would take care of me, I was pretty miserable. `
`Maybe it wouldn't have mattered if that gentle Uncle Hideyoshi and George onii-chan had been with me, `
`but I hated the thought of living all alone with Aunt Eva. `
`I'd frankly said that to Grandpa, hoping to live together in his house. `
`However, Aunt Eva had been very insistent that she should be the one to look after me. `
`She had no desire to remarry, so as her successor, I was essential if the Ushiromiya family was to continue. `
`Aunt Eva felt very strongly about the family. `
`She insisted that she take charge of me right away, so that she could give me an education and lifestyle fitting for a successor. `
`After that, it seems that confusing negotiations with lawyers took place. `
`...But in the end, I was forced to go live with Aunt Eva. `
`After doing that, Aunt Eva told me something. `
`You must bear all of the glory and history of the Ushiromiya family. `
`And in order to make you a fitting successor to bear that, the rest of your life will be dedicated to frantic studying. `
`Sacrifice the rest of your life for the Ushiromiya family. `
`...That's what she said. `
`At first, I thought she meant that literally. `
`But I quickly realized that wasn't the case. `
`Because even now, in Aunt Eva's eyes, `
`the one most fitting to succeed her was the late George onii-chan. `
`At our first meal together, I received strict instructions and questioning about table manners... `
`and was forced to listen to her abuse Mom and Dad as though they'd been neglectful in their discipline. `
`I also received the same strict instructions regarding manners at my first party, `
`and my clumsiness had been disparaged in front of everybody, forcing me to endure insults to Mom and Dad as well. `
`After that repeated over and over, I eventually began to understand. `
`Aunt Eva didn't really want to make me her successor. `
`She thought George onii-chan was the only one truly suited to be her successor, `
`...and she couldn't forgive the fact that it was to be me instead. `
`So she insulted me in front of lots of people. `
`She humiliated me. `
`And she made it known exactly how I was inferior to George onii-chan to both acquaintances and strangers, `
`...surely in place of a memorial service for her dead son... `
`...Or rather, ...she must still be mourning his death. `
`...However, that wasn't something I could endure. `
`I couldn't possibly live together with Aunt Eva. `
`...I was kept like a pet, my life continually compared with her dead son's. `
`I understood that even when I was still in elementary school. `
`I tried to escape the Ushiromiya house and run off to the house of my Grandpa on my mother's side. `
`However, Aunt Eva had already foreseen that. `
`...No, thinking back on it, she might've lured me into escaping. `
`I was caught by the guards and brought back, `
`......and for being a coward who had smeared the Ushiromiya family crest with mud and tried to throw it away, `
`......in a way that makes my whole body shake and shiver just remembering it, `
`......I was punished. `
`How should I describe what Aunt Eva was like when she punished me? `
`In a frenzy? `
`Gleeful? `
`...I saw the anger and sadness of losing her beloved son, and well as the hatred and pain from me stealing that inheritance from the son who should've received it. `
`And the dark pleasure at being able to let those feelings out on me. `
`...I was hit with all those negative emotions at once. `
`Then, all of my free time and freedom to act was stolen, and I was put under surveillance around the clock. `
`I may have lived in a gorgeous mansion, dressed in expensive clothes, `
`...but my heart and my dignity had been trampled upon, and I was the Ushiromiya family's slave, `
`...its cattle. `
`Compared to that lifestyle, the derisive laughter of my classmates here was calm and pleasant. `
`...It caused my heart no trouble... `
`After burying almost all of the fields of the questionnaire with 'nothing in particular', I folded it and put it in my pocket. `
`...Because if I left it in my desk, it might 'disappear' again. `
`During lunch break, after dropping it off at the postbox in the student council room, `
`I finished lunch by myself, as usual, and headed behind the school building, where no one could be seen. `
`...Only my time by myself could protect me from the derisive laughter and gossip. `
`Since I was hated and didn't have a single friend, my time alone was the most kind to me. `
`After checking the surrounding bushes to see whether some malicious classmates were hiding and threatening my time of quiet, `
`I finally relaxed the tension from my entire body, knowing that I had gained some true peace. `
`Then, ...I let out a sigh. `
`...It faltered, heavy, as though it was the first time I had breathed out today. `
`My old favorite place behind the vegetable garden storehouse... `
`had been found out by my classmates, and I'd been teased, so this was my new lunchtime hideaway... `
`There was nowhere to sit behind the school building. `
`As I crouched near the wall in the shadow of the bushes, I opened my bag and took out a book with an elaborate, old-fashioned binding... `
`Just glancing at it, you'd probably think it was a religious book or something written in the Middle Ages. `
`But this wasn't a book. `
`It was a diary. `
`Of course, it wasn't my diary. `
`......There weren't any special things worth writing about in my daily life. `
`Every single day was just gray, ...cold and dry. `
`In those completely unchanging days, there aren't any changes worth writing down. `
`This was...the diary of Maria onee-chan, a girl I'd been very close to. `
`She'd been a bit strange and three years older than me, but Onee-chan was always a warm, wonderful cousin. `
`She would always grab me by the hand and let me join in on some fun game. `
`...I remembered that being able to see her was the most fun part of our family gatherings... `
`When I opened the diary, the characters, which were made fairly skillfully considering that this was an elementary schooler, `
`were packed close together, though they were written on every other line. `
`Was she just hopelessly obsessed with jotting everything down in her diary? `
`...Probably not. `
`To her, writing her daily life down in a diary was probably like having a conversation with another part of herself. `
`So rather than an object on which the events of her day were written down, `
`Maria onee-chan's diary was written like a letter to another part of herself, telling of the events of that day. `
`I found this diary among her belongings after her death and secretly took it home. `
`At first, I'd felt that reading someone else's diary might be boorish...and satisfied myself with just keeping it by my side, `
`...but I couldn't help flipping through the pages and reading through it bit by bit. `
`And by now, she had {i:become my only friend}. `
`I gently opened to the page with the bookmark. `
`"...Sorry to keep you waiting, Maria onee-chan. `
`...Could you let me hear your story again...?" `
`At the same time, `
`...a very, very soft breeze blew, tickling the paper. `
`I thought the open diary might have sparkled faintly. `
`...The weather's good today. `
`Maria onee-chan loves the wonderful rays of sunlight. `
`So I'm sure she's in a good mood. `
`On the pages of the open diary...no, in the world of the diary, Maria onee-chan showed herself... `
`I'm pretty sure she was nine when she died. `
`...So her form was already younger than me. `
`But I call her Onee-chan, so she affectionately calls me Ange. `
`"Uu-. `
`Ange, you were slow getting here today. `
`Was it packed at lunch...?" `
`"...Yes. `
`It's always packed. `
`Groups of friends set up camp in the seats, and they stay there even after they've finished eating. `
`It's pretty fatal if you get to the dining hall late. `
`...I was on cleanup duty today." `
`"...Uu-! `
`I eat fast! `
`The faster you eat, the more you can play! `
`Uu-!" `
`Maybe she realized I was holding a grudge because that duty had been forced upon me and shortened my lunch break by a bit. `
`Maria onee-chan brightly changed the subject. `
`Grateful for that act of kindness, I responded by saying I was a slow eater. `
`Maria calmed me down, saying something about teaching me the trick to eating fast. `
`I read about it in her diary. `
`No, I heard it from Maria onee-chan. `
`She was ranked number 1 among the girls in the speed-eating ranking for her grade's newspaper. `
`She was apparently very proud of that, but a little disappointed that her mother, Aunt Rosa, hadn't praised her very much for it. `
`"Uu-! `
`Then, let's start our story for today. `
`How far did we get yesterday? `
`Uu-?" `
`"Umm... `
`This far. `
`Until you got Sakutaro as a present, Maria onee-chan. `
`...You promised that you'd tell me about Sakutaro." `
`"Uu-! `
`Let's talk about Sakutaro! `
`You know, Sakutaro is a reeeally cute stuffed animal! `
`I'm sure you'd like him too, Ange! `
`Uu-!" `
`"Yeah. `
`Tell me that story. `
`...The only time I can relax at school...is when I'm listening to your stories during lunch break." `
`"Uu-! `
`I'll tell you about it! `
`Sakutaro was really, umm, umm!" `
`When I looked at Maria onee-chan, who was always in a good mood, it made my heart feel warm as well. `
`As I listened to her tale, I began to get absorbed into her world... `
`"Happy Birthday, Maria. `
`Sorry I got back so late." `
`"Uu-! `
`Good job with your work, Mama! `
`I know you're busy, so even though you were late, I waited without crying. `
`I was good and waited, watching TV!" `
`"Yes, you're such a good girl, Maria. `
`As a present for waiting politely, you can order anything you want today. `
`Of course, only as much as you can eat, okay?" `
`"Uu-uu-! `
`Today, can I change my corn soup to onion gratin soup?!" `
`"Yes, that's fine." `
`"Uu-uu-! `
`It's 200 yen more expensive, but can I change it to prosciutto pizza?!" `
`"Yes, that's fine. `
`If you really can eat it. `
`...But that's okay. `
`It's your birthday, after all. `
`There must be a reward for the good girl who waited so patiently." `
`"Uu-uu-uu-! `
`Then, then, can I have enchilada cheesecake for dessert?! `
`And then, and then, the chef's choice fruit salad and kids' french fries! `
`I want to drink melon soda too! `
`Uu-uu-uu-! `
`I'm a good girl, I'm a good girl! `
`Mama praised me, uu-uu-uu-{p:0:♪}" `
`"*giggle* `
`You're getting a little too excited. `
`If you don't quiet down a bit, you'll disturb the other customers." `
`When Rosa gently admonished her, Maria stuck her tongue out and eased up a little. `
`...But it seemed that she was having a hard time repressing her excitement at being able to eat out with her mother after such a long time. `
`Today was Maria's birthday. `
`Rosa always tried to let Maria spend her birthdays at great restaurants. `
`When Maria had been in kindergarten, they sometimes invited other kids from the neighborhood over and had a party at home. `
`Rosa would make a wonderful cake and snacks and decorate the house herself, making it a huge celebration. `
`But when they moved and Maria no longer had friends in the neighborhood, Rosa had started splurging at expensive restaurants instead. `
`However, today, they were in a normal family restaurant. `
`It was also a little late in the day for a kid like Maria to eat there, even with a parent. `
`Actually, she had gotten reservations at a fantastic place that would surely have pleased Maria. `
`Of course, she had also prepared a wonderful cake with Maria's name written on it. `
`...But Rosa just hadn't been able to finish up her business...and had been forced to cancel. `
`Since that plan had been traded for a local family restaurant, Rosa felt a little indebted to Maria. `
`So she was prepared to spoil Maria a bit and let her have whatever she wanted tonight... `
`"...You never used to eat much, did you, Maria onee-chan? `
`Was it really all right to order that much?" `
`"Uu-. `
`I can't eat very much, but I like to have a lot lined up. `
`You know, like on a birthday table? `
`If it's colored all over with red and blue and green and yellow, it makes you really happy!" `
`"...You're right. `
`Having your birthday table be colorful can make you feel happy. `
`...Birthdays at my place were no match for yours, Maria onee-chan, but the cakes we bought at the Fumiya store in front of the station were always gorgeous..." `
`Ange thought back to her own birthdays nostalgically. `
`Even though Dad was busy, he sometimes came home just to show up at my birthday party...and then went right back to his company. `
`At the time, I was sad, but now I understand how important I was to Dad. `
`Of course, Mom also took very good care of me. `
`In particular, her birthday presents were always in excellent taste, `
`and she sometimes arranged for them several months in advance. `
`Even though we always sent an invitation to Battler onii-chan, he didn't get along with Dad or something, so he kept not coming. `
`...So when he did come, I was really happy... `
`...The birthday parties when the whole four-person family gathered made for fun memories that I'll never forget... `
`"Uu-. `
`Ange's birthdays sound like a lot of fun too. `
`Battler and Uncle Rudolf are really lively. `
`Yay, yay, *giggle*. `
`Battler got covered in cola, ahahahaha." `
`Maria onee-chan peeked into my happy memory. `
`As I sat quietly, wearing the origami helmet that Dad had made for fun, I was a little embarrassed. `
`In my hand was a paper gun that Battler onii-chan had folded for me. `
`...And Mom was taking a commemorative photo. `
`It was the happiest moment of my life. `
`"But your birthday's no worse, Maria onee-chan. `
`And this is the day you get him, right? `
`Sakutaro." `
`"Uu-! `
`I was reeeally looking forward to it. `
`I got so excited, wondering when Mama would show me the wrapped present in the corner of her bag." `
`'Sakutaro' is the name of a stuffed animal that Maria was to receive that day. `
`For quite some time before then, Aunt Rosa had been making a stuffed animal to give Maria as a present today. `
`Hearing that it was a cute lion stuffed animal, `
`Maria onee-chan had already given it the name Sakutaro, even though she hadn't received it yet. `
`Today, she was looking forward to meeting Sakutaro even more than her own birthday. `
`Aunt Rosa ran a clothing design company. `
`It seemed to be some kind of brand name. `
`...What was it, Anti-Rosa...? `
`It seems their catch phrase was 'I can't forgive the me of yesterday'. `
`...Unfortunately, I've never met someone who knew of that brand name. `
`Maybe it wasn't that famous. `
`So Aunt Rosa was pretty skilled with her hands. `
`I heard that she made some of the clothing she wore herself. `
`So making a stuffed animal had to be well within her capabilities. `
`"...A hand-made stuffed animal... That's pretty amazing. `
`By the way, why did you call it Sakutaro?" `
`"Uu-. `
`Actually wanted to call it 'Sakura'. `
`But it's a male lion, so she told me to give it a boy's name. `
`So I added a boy-like 'tarou' and called him 'Sakutarou'. `
`Eventually, the last 'u' disappeared!" `
`"Why 'Sakura'?" `
`"Uu-! `
`The main character in Card Master Sakura!" `
`It was the name of the main character in a TV anime that was popular at the time. `
`...The fact that she'd simply borrowed the name of a character she liked was...how should I say it...as innocent and cute as you'd expect from someone that age. `
`"Uu-! `
`Mama, Mama! `
`Still no Sakutaro? `
`I wanna let Sakutaro join in on my birthday too." `
`"Presents always come at the end, right? `
`If you open it now, it'll get dirty. `
`Hold on until the meal is over." `
`"Then I'll finish eating quickly! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!" `
`As soon as she proclaimed that, she started tearing into her meal. `
`Aunt Rosa got mad at her, saying that was rude. `
`It seemed that she'd expected this would happen right away. `
`I also thought that, given how straightforward Maria was, that was probably what she'd do, `
`so it was kind of pleasant when my expectations weren't betrayed. `
`In the end, Aunt Rosa lost to her daughter's eyes, which were sparkling with anticipation, `
`cleaned up the table, and took out the long-awaited wrapped present. `
`"Happy birthday, Maria. `
`...I wasn't able to spend much time on it, so I couldn't make it very well..." `
`"Uu-! `
`If you made it, I'll be happy with anything! `
`Uu-uu-uu-! `
`Sakutaro-, Sakutaro-uu-uu-!" `
`Aunt Rosa spoke a bit humbly, but Maria onee-chan was happy even before opening the wrapping. `
`...I could really understand that feeling. `
`It's not a problem of quality. `
`Just the fact that it was a handmade present was more pleasing than anything. `
`"Can I open it? `
`Can I open it?!" `
`"I wanted to wait until we got back home before doing it, `
`...but...just for a bit, okay? `
`We'll just take a look and say hello, then put it back. `
`You can give him a proper greeting once we get home. `
`We're in public, so you can't fool around, okay? `
`Can you promise?" `
`"Uu-! `
`Promise, promise! `
`So can I open it? `
`Can I open iiit? `
`Mamaaa." `
`"Yes, yes, just for a bit, okay?" `
`"Yaaaaaaaaaaayy...{p:0:☆}" `
`Before Aunt Rosa finished talking, Maria started unwrapping it. `
`As soon as she did, ...yellow and orange peeked out. `
`What appeared was a slightly blank-looking lion stuffed animal, `
`with cute round eyes and a white chest. `
`It was about the size of a small pillow. `
`It looked pretty big next to someone as short as Maria onee-chan, but it probably wasn't that large. `
`From the perspective of someone who didn't know better, it would probably look like something cheap bought from a department store or something. `
`But to Maria onee-chan, it was her mother's handmade stuffed animal, the only one of its kind in the world and irreplaceable. `
`"Sakutaro, Sakutaro!! `
`*giggle*giggle*!! `
`Cute, cute, sooo cute...! `
`Thank you Mama, thank you Mama, thank you so much for making such a cute stuffed animal, even though you're so busy with work...!" `
`"...If you praise me that much, it's actually embarrassing. `
`I couldn't take much time, so I couldn't make anything that good. `
`I actually wanted to make one so big that you couldn't wrap your arms around it..." `
`"No, this is good! `
`With this size, we can always be together. `
`We can go out together. `
`Sakutaro, I'm your Onee-chaaan, uryu-{p:0:☆}" `
`"It really is an adorable stuffed animal. `
`So this kid is Sakutaro, your best friend." `
`"Uu-! `
`We can't go to school together, but me and my best friend are always, always together at home. `
`You know, Sakutaro is reeeally innocent and cute, and always nice to me. `
`He supports me when I'm feeling down, and plays a lot with me when I'm feeling good!" `
`"So I'm never lonely anymore. `
`Not lonely when Mama's busy with work and I'm all alone, not even when no one plays with me at school. `
`Isn't that right, Sakutaro, uryu-{p:0:☆}" `
`...At school, Maria onee-chan had lived in the same kind of environment as I did. `
`Compared to the other kids in her class, Maria onee-chan's tempo was always a little slow. `
`Her sensibilities and ways of viewing things were a little peculiar...and a little too idiosyncratic for her to blend in. `
`Her grades were low as well, and since she was talkative about everything related to the occult, her specialty, she was treated like a weirdo by everyone else in class. `
`If you were touched by Maria onee-chan, you'd be cursed... Stuff like that. `
`Apparently, everyone in her class acted like she was disgusting, made fun of her, and avoided her. `
`If a boy bumped into Maria onee-chan, `
`he'd start rubbing that part against the other boys, as if he'd gotten some scum on him. `
`They'd pick up her stuff like it was something filthy and chase the other boys around with it. `
`It seems the girls thought even speaking to her was unpleasant, `
`so they ignored her all the time, only giggling and sneering at her whenever she made a mistake. `
`"......It looks like bullying is the same in all eras. `
`Humans really don't advance at all, do they? `
`If only they'd just get wiped out." `
`"...I'm sad when I'm bullied, but I think it can't be helped." `
`"It can't be helped...? `
`Why not...?" `
`"After all, there's a rule that says every class has to have a single bullied kid." `
`"...That's a horrible rule. `
`I'd like to find the person who made it and hit them over the head with a brick. `
`Using the corner, of course." `
`"If I wasn't there, then there'd surely be a new bullied kid chosen in my place. `
`By staying strong, I can protect that kid." `
`As she said that, she smiled faintly. `
`......Maria onee-chan's way of thinking really is unusual. `
`According to her, from the beginning, a witch had resided in that place called a school. `
`No, she says that any place where a lot of people gather will have a witch residing there. `
`The witch tries to steal the students' souls through death by disease or accidents. `
`Apparently, she sometimes also corrupts those souls, leading them down that path of evil. `
`She says that an angel came, not content to let that continue. `
`"...And the angel...tried to finish off that witch. `
`The witch was powerful, and the fight took seven days and seven nights, but even then, it still wasn't over. `
`The tired-out witch asked for a truce and proposed this." `
`"I heard about that one before. `
`...'Until now, I've made half of the students in the class become sick or injured. `
`But in exchange, I've protected the remaining half of the students from sickness and injury. `
`Therefore, if one member of the class becomes a sacrifice to me and is made into the 'bullied kid', `
`I shall protect all of the other students from sickness and injury', `
`......right?" `
`"Uu-. `
`The angel thought about it. `
`Compared to half the class meeting with misfortune, having only one person be unfortunate would be much better. `
`Then, the witch said that she'd protect the safety of all the other students, using her powerful magic." `
`"If there are 40 students in a class... `
`and the 20 victims are reduced to 1, then 19 people are saved. `
`...It's actually a reasonable proposal." `
`I wonder if there's some theme behind this fairy tale. `
`If it's a creation by Maria onee-chan, a nine-year-old girl, that'd be pretty impressive. `
`"The angel decided to accept that proposal. `
`So, through that single sacrifice, 19 people were saved. `
`...That's why my role's important. `
`The witch is protecting 19 people." `
`"...Because we become sacrifices? `
`......Well, I don't remember ever being thanked by those 19 people." `
`...Maria onee-chan's idea was too compassionate. `
`Both of us are suffering from a very similar type of misfortune. `
`...And yet, maybe a small difference in our way of thinking changes how peaceful our hearts are. `
`"So, you aren't sad, Maria onee-chan...?" `
`"Uu-. `
`I'm not sad at all. `
`After all, I'll be together with Sakutaro from now on. `
`Right, `
`Sakutaro?" `
`"Uryu-! If I can be with Maria, I'll be happy too!" `
`"Look, Sakutaro says he's happy too. `
`Uu-{p:0:☆}" `
`Maria onee-chan hugged the Sakutaro stuffed animal, playing both sides of the conversation herself. `
`I don't understand it. `
`...But that's exactly why I want to reach Maria onee-chan's level. `
`...So I was intensely drawn to her tale and her words. `
`"Ange, is it tough because you're all alone...?" `
`"...It is tough. `
`But...just the time I can be like this with you is different. `
`Because I'm not...all alone." `
`"Then, if Sakutaro also becomes your friend, it'll be even more fun. `
`Uu-! `
`Then starting today, Sakutaro is Ange's new friend! `
`Right, Sakutaro?" `
`"Uryu? `
`I am...Ange's friend...? `
`Uryu-, Ange-!" `
`Skillfully moving the stuffed animal like it was a puppet, Maria onee-chan expressed Sakutaro's emotions. `
`She was controlling him, but the charming way he waved his short hand and cocked his head to the side... `
`made it feel like he really was a new friend called Sakutaro. `
`Of course, looking at it with cold eyes, `
`it would only appear that Maria onee-chan was comforting me when I was grumpy. `
`...But a soul had definitely been sent into that stuffed animal. `
`The soul of Maria onee-chan's love. `
`So I acknowledged the existence of a being called Sakutaro inside that stuffed animal. `
`"Come on, say hi to Sakutaro too, Ange. `
`Come on, you say hi too, Sakutaro-{p:0:☆}" `
`"Uryu...? `
`Is Ange... `
`a scary person...?" `
`As Sakutaro timidly looked at me, `
`he unexpectedly met my gaze...and hid behind Maria onee-chan's back in surprise. `
`...Maria onee-chan really is good at playing with stuffed animals. `
`"It's okay, Sakutaro. `
`Ange isn't scary, she's a really nice girl. `
`Uu{p:0:☆}" `
`"...H-Hello. `
`I'm Sakutarou... `
`...Uryu..." `
`"*giggle* `
`...Pleased to meet you, Sakutarou. `
`I'm Ange. `
`I'm glad to have a new friend." `
`I held out my hand as though asking for a handshake, `
`and Sakutaro's short hand was stuck out towards me, lightly touching my index finger. `
`After all, when a human and a stuffed animal shake hands, their sizes are too different. `
`This greeting by touching each other's fingers was our handshake. `
`"Uu-{p:0:☆} `
`Now, Ange and Sakutaro are already friends! `
`Two people are more fun than one, and three people are more fun than two. `
`Uu-!" `
`"Uryu-!" `
`Maria onee-chan had given the name 'Sakutarou' to the stuffed animal she was to receive on her birthday... `
`and had warmed and expanded his existence in her heart for a long, long time. `
`Therefore, even before she met him, his existence was sublimated into a personality. `
`Even at the first moment they met, they were already friends. `
`Of course, that wasn't anything extraordinary in Maria onee-chan's eyes, `
`although I don't think she'd personified and loved anything quite as much as Sakutarou. `
`She loved the things she owned very much, treating them just like friends or beloved pets. `
`Maybe Aunt Rosa hadn't let her keep a pet at some point in time, `
`so she felt like treasuring objects instead. `
`...And maybe she was so isolated that she'd been forced to find a friend nearby. `
`Because of all that, what happened that day wasn't anything extraordinary from her perspective. `
`Even so, Sakutarou...no, maybe I should call it 'Sakutaro' like Maria onee-chan. `
`There's no doubt that Sakutaro was a stuffed animal... `
`no, a friend...whom she loved more than anything...or anyone. `
`"Hello, ...it's Mama. `
`You're in a good mood. Is a friend over?" `
`"Uu-! `
`Playing with Sakutaro! `
`Sakutaro, knock it off, *giggle*giggle*!" `
`It was already about 9:00 at night. `
`Rosa had asked because this wasn't a good time to have a friend over, and she'd been just a little surprised, `
`but when she thought about it, Maria didn't have any friends who would come over to play, did she...? `
`Even so, to think that she'd have so much fun playing with that stuffed animal. `
`Rosa was very pleased that Maria had liked her birthday present so much. `
`"Sorry. `
`Mama just can't get her work finished tonight... `
`The next season's lineup is having a tough time. `
`It looks like we're finally starting to get orders bit by bit, and I want to somehow give it a bit more impact so we can answer to their expectations..." `
`"So, you're spending the night? `
`Sure, okay. `
`Do your best, Mama!" `
`"R-Really? `
`Thank you, Maria... `
`Thanks for being understanding about Mama's work..." `
`Rosa was surprised that Maria had accepted so easily that she wouldn't be able to come home from work. `
`To Rosa, having to tell Maria that she'd be coming home late or staying overnight was a huge burden. `
`Maria would start crying about how lonely she was on the other end of the phone, and it took a lot of time and effort to calm her down. `
`To think that Maria would accept it in such high spirits... `
`Is this also thanks to Sakutarou? `
`...Rosa was once again pleased that she'd given her daughter such a good present. `
`"I'll make sure I come back this time tomorrow. `
`Let's eat dinner together then. `
`You haven't eaten dinner yet, have you Maria? `
`Buy a bento at the convenience store and eat it. `
`No sweets, and no soda. `
`I'll check the receipt and the change, understand?" `
`"Uu-! `
`Shopping with Sakutaro, shopping with Sakutaro...!" `
`"H-Hey! `
`Not Sakutaro, have him watch over the house!" `
`From Maria's manner of speech, Rosa got the feeling that Maria might've gone shopping with that stuffed animal without her knowing about it. `
`Rosa's forehead creased, and after sourly saying that Maria definitely mustn't do that, she hung up. `
`"Uu-... `
`Mama said I mustn't go shopping with Sakutaro..." `
`"Uryu-... `
`Can't go shopping with Maria... `
`Staying home alone...will be lonely..." `
`"Why did Mama say not to go shopping with Sakutaro...? `
`Uu-..." `
`"Uryu... `
`...I'm sure that if Maria was seen with me, it would be embarrassing..." `
`"...Embarrassing? `
`Why?" `
`"Mama says not to take me outside a lot. `
`And she usually says Maria can't do it because she's too old..." `
`"Uu-? `
`But I'm not embarrassed at all to be with Sakutaro, right?" `
`"I'm a lion, ...but I'm a stuffed animal." `
`"You're a lion and a stuffed animal, but you're my friend. `
`So let's go out together{p:0:☆} `
`Just when Mama isn't around, as a secret. `
`Uu-? `
`You aren't saying that you're embarrassed, are you?" `
`"I'm not embarrassed, but... `
`...uryu, ...the people outside are a little scary..." `
`"Is that it?! `
`Then, I'll make it so that you can go outside without being scared! `
`Leave it to me, I've got something that's really useful...!" `
`Maria started fishing around her messy room. `
`Rosa often told her to clean it up, but Maria apparently didn't like doing it. `
`However, Maria herself knew more or less where everything was. `
`So much so that if it were to be cleaned up, she would have trouble finding where anything was. `
`"Here it is! `
`Hey, look, Sakutaro. `
`A knapsaaack!" `
`Maria proudly held it up high. `
`Sakutaro looked at the knapsack, which was gaping open, squirming as though saying 'Are you serious...?' `
`"Uryu, ...Maria, you aren't saying..." `
`"Uu-! `
`This way, we can go shopping together, and Sakutaro won't be scared!" `
`Maria held Sakutaro up and started stuffing him into the knapsack. `
`At first, she tried to stick him in head-first, but then he'd be upside-down and suffocate. `
`So she pulled him out and tried pushing him in again, feet-first. `
`"Uryu-...! `
`Tiiight, craaamped, daaark. `
`Uryu-! `
`Urk." `
`"Look, it's all right. `
`If you stick your head out, it isn't cramped, it isn't dark, and it isn't scary. `
`And it's a good view. `
`Uu-!" `
`"Uryu, you're right. `
`...Is it okay for me to go shopping with Maria like this...?" `
`"Yeah, it'll be fine! `
`What should we get for dinner tonight?! `
`Come on, let's go out, Sakutaro! `
`Uu-!" `
`"*giggle* `
`Looks like you're having fun, Maria onee-chan." `
`"Yeah, it's a lot of fun. `
`Even things that would be lonely and boring alone all become fun with Sakutaro. `
`Any Human friend would have to go home when it gets late." `
`"But Sakutaro doesn't go home, so we can be together all the time. `
`He'll watch TV with me, `
`be together even in the futon, `
`and even hold my hand on scary nights when there's thunder. `
`He'll chase away the monsters in the closet and under the bed. `
`Sakutaro is reliable!" `
`"Uryu. `
`Since I'm a lion, I'll show my courage and chase away any monsters that scare Maria. `
`Uryu-, rooar." `
`They were so close that it made me a little envious. `
`I'm supposedly older now than Maria onee-chan was then. `
`But Maria onee-chan really is my onee-chan, and I still haven't reached her level. `
`...If only I had a friend close by like Sakutaro. `
`"Sakutaro and I are your close friends, right? `
`We're aaalways by your side. `
`It's just that your magic is weak, so you can't perceive us unless you open my diary like this." `
`"...Perceive? `
`You know some pretty difficult words, Maria onee-chan." `
`According to her, this world is full of magic and spirits. `
`And they're as natural and nearby as a light breeze. `
`"You don't normally notice or see the wind, `
`but when incense smoke or something draws trails, you can see it, right?" `
`"...Right. `
`And even if you can't see it, it's always nearby." `
`"That's it. `
`We're always really close by to you, Ange. `
`Gods and spirits and guardian spirits...are always right next to us. `
`But if you aren't conscious of them, you can't feel their existence. `
`Like wind that can't be seen with the eyes. `
`But they certainly are near us, and if they draw trails in the smoke called magic, anyone can see them." `
`I thought I'd only be able to meet Maria onee-chan while this diary was open. `
`But from what she says, she's always with me, and I can meet her at any time if I truly desire to. `
`"Along with a record of my life, I left a Fragment of my own soul in my diary. `
`So the power of my magic resides in this diary. `
`But it's very faint, so only you can feel it." `
`"...Only I...can tell it's there?" `
`"Yes. `
`After all, the power of a witch resides in you, just like me! `
`If you study hard, you too will definitely become a great witch in the future." `
`"......A witch. `
`I wonder if that'd be fun." `
`"Uu-! `
`It is fun. `
`If you do that, you'll be able to know that Sakutaro and I are always by your side, even without opening the diary. `
`If you do that, every day will become fun! `
`If you do that, I'll introduce you to many other friends. `
`If you do that, every day will get busy and very lively." `
`"That might be fun. `
`...I do have the grimoire you left behind, Maria onee-chan. `
`I'll try reading it seriously sometime soon. `
`...If I do that, I won't be all alone anymore, `
`right?" `
`"Uu-!" "Uryu-!" `
`Maria onee-chan and Sakutaro said that at the same time, happy that I had developed an interest in the world of witches. `
`With her knapsack on her back and half of Sakutaro's face peeking out of it, `
`she triumphantly walked through the shopping district late at night. `
`Well, it was that time of day, after all. `
`Everyone in the shopping district was either a shop owner lowering the shutters on their shops, or an employee rushing, or else staggering, on their way home. `
`Amidst all that, Maria, who was in a good mood like someone on a hike, probably looked quite merry. `
`Every once in a while, passing employees would glance at her back with the eyes of someone seeing something out of place. `
`Office ladies giggled at the cute stuffed animal poking its head out of the knapsack. `
`The supermarket had been closed for a while by this time. `
`However, convenience stores, which had been growing in popularity lately, stayed open until midnight. `
`It was very convenient for Maria, whose mother's return was often late. `
`Maria lowered the knapsack from her back and, carrying it like a child in her arms, she headed over to the sweet buns corner. `
`She pointed to a sweet bun she had eaten before, explaining to Sakutaro that this one was delicious, `
`and that one was pretty good too. `
`Sakutaro seemed to be enjoying it a lot. `
`"I'm gonna have the three-colored one! `
`With just this one, you can eat bean jam and cream and strawberry jam! `
`But there's sometimes greenish-brown bean jam or white bean jam. `
`There should be one kind of bean jam." `
`"Uryu-! `
`Looks like having different things inside makes them interesting. `
`Uryu-!" `
`"Next, I'll have a fruit yogurt! `
`There's fruit in it, but it isn't a sweet, right? `
`Yeah, I'm sure Mama will be fine with it. `
`Do you want one too, Sakutaro?" `
`"Uryu? `
`Is that really okay...? `
`What about the money?" `
`"Uu-, no problem! `
`Look, it's {c:86EF9C:{ruby:(5000 yen):Shotoku Taishi}}, uu! `
`So I can buy you whatever you want too, Sakutaro. `
`Let's eat together! `
`Would you like some yogurt too, Sakutaro?" `
`When Maria made to grab another one of the same fruit yogurt, Sakutaro bent his head slightly, worried. `
`"Uryu... `
`But...I can't eat a big one, so a small one will be fine." `
`"Uu-. `
`Then how about a small yogurt? `
`It's 30 yen. `
`That's cheap." `
`"Uryu! `
`That's good enough for me. `
`Yogurt with Maria!" `
`"Yogurt with Sakutaro! `
`Uu-!" `
`Maria put the three-colored bread and the two yogurts into a shopping basket and brought them to the register. `
`The man running the register had been in charge of the tobacco shop that had been here until last year. `
`"I seem to be seeing you a lot at this time of day, little lady. `
`You're a good girl, but maybe you'd better come with your mother if you're going to go shopping at this time in the future, okay?" `
`"Mama said it's okay, so it's fine! `
`Mama always comes home late because of her work, but we aren't lonely. `
`Right, Sakutaro?" `
`"Uryu-!" `
`"Really? That sounds tough. `
`Here, I'll give you some free soda." `
`The man working at the store took a can of leftover soda or something from behind the register and packed it into the bag with everything else. `
`"Thank you mister! `
`Uu-! `
`Isn't that great, Sakutaro?!" `
`"Uryu-!" `
`Since she had been told not to buy soda, she couldn't take it back home. `
`So she decided to drink it on her way back and not bring the empty can back home. `
`With the vinyl bag with the sweet bun in it around her elbow, `
`holding the knapsack with Sakutaro in it with that same arm and drinking her soda, the two of them walked home... `
`"...Uu-. `
`Yuzukoshou soda isn't really good... `
`You wanna try too, Sakutaro...?" `
`"Uryu? `
`......Uryuuryuuryu, uryu-!! `
`Gaah. `
`...Uryuuuu, you're mean, Maria... `
`Nasssty..." `
`"It sure is, uu-uu-." `
`Of course, it's not like she could actually make a stuffed animal drink soda. `
`She just put the can to Sakutaro's mouth and pretended to tilt it. `
`But it was fun for Maria to share the taste of this weird drink that she had gotten for free with Sakutaro... `
`There was a huge moon in the sky. `
`At times, that moon had been clouded by tears when she'd been unmanageable during Rosa's overnight stays... `
`and when she'd been scolded by her mother. `
`But this moon was very warm, and it seemed to watch over the two of them as they enjoyed their trip home by themselves... `
`Maria and Sakutaro. `
`...Ange watched the two of them go from behind. `
`"............" `
`She looked so...warm from behind. `
`After looking at the backs of Maria onee-chan and Sakutaro together, `
`it became very hard to remember all of those long nights when she'd cried because her mother hadn't come home... `
`...I couldn't say it to Maria onee-chan, `
`...but if I'd been in the same position, I may have given a stuffed animal the name Sakutarou, `
`...but it wouldn't have been anything more or less than a stuffed animal. `
`Anyone can make a relationship that only distracts you from your loneliness. `
`But Maria onee-chan was different. `
`Sakutaro isn't a stuffed animal or a toy. `
`...He was a real friend, and far from just distracting Maria from her loneliness, `
`he changed the nights without her mother into a fun time where they could play all by themselves... `
`Was it because Sakutarou was a special stuffed animal? `
`Because her mother had made it herself? `
`Because it was very, very cute? `
`...Probably not. `
`If there's a secret here, it doesn't lie within Sakutarou. `
`...I think it probably lies within Maria onee-chan. `
`"......This is the power of magic you were talking about, Maria onee-chan...?" `
`"Uu-. `
`Knowing magic means that you notice a lot of friends right beside you that you didn't notice before. `
`It's as fun as having a bunch of new toy shops pop up all over the neighborhood!" `
`...If even I, locked up in an academy without a single friend, `
`...had power like Maria onee-chan, I wonder if I could make my days just a bit richer. `
`I wonder if I'll be able to honestly shed tears on nights I feel like crying, to smile on gray nights. `
`"Yes. `
`You can. `
`You can do it. `
`After all, you also have what it takes to become a witch." `
`"......What it takes...to become a witch." `
`"I have what it takes to become a witch too. `
`So I've still got a lot more studying and training to do. `
`I'll definitely become a wonderful witch, flying in the sky on a broom, drawing rainbows with my cane, making candy fall from the sky. `
`I can definitely do it. `
`Then, I'll show you too. `
`It'll definitely be like a scene from a wonderful dream." `
`Maria onee-chan said that, making an absolute promise with her smile. `
`...There's no way I can become a witch. `
`But if Maria onee-chan says that, it makes me feel that maybe, I really can become a witch. `
`Because, in reality, ...on that desolate night, when no flower of a smile could possibly have bloomed, her magic surely gave birth to a smile. `
`"...I wonder if... `
`...I can become a witch." `
`"You can. `
`...You're a bit older, so your soul is bound a bit more by gravity. `
`That might make training tougher than it is for me. `
`But you definitely can. `
`After all, you're already touching a small piece of magic." `
`"I am? `
`...Magic...?" `
`"Yeah. `
`Come on, look. In a world where I don't exist, you summoned me, and you're talking with me." `
`"......This is...magic...?" `
`"Yeah. `
`You've expanded the Fragment of my soul that I left in my diary, and you're reviving me right now. `
`I also said it a short while ago, right? `
`Since you managed to reunite with me and have a conversation, since you're able to smile every once in a while, you must have some magical talent, Ange. `
`Your Maria onee-chan guarantees it. `
`Uu-!" `
`"...You said it a second ago, Onee-chan. `
`I thought I could only meet you while the diary was open, but you're really nearby all the time, right? `
`...If I had more of the power of magic, would I be able to see you...? `
`And, just like now, ...would I be able to talk with you, Onee-chan...? `
`At any time...?" `
`"Yeah. `
`We can talk at any time. `
`I'm there by your side to say good morning, and even during class. `
`Let's talk together during dull classes to distract you from your boredom. `
`I'll also be there to talk to you during meals, so let's always be together like this during lunch break." `
`"We're with you after school too, and of course, I'm always by your side even after you return to the dormitory. `
`...It's just that you don't {i:'see' me except when the diary is opened}." `
`"............Even if I close the diary, `
`...Maria onee-chan, `
`...you'll be by my side, right?" `
`"Yes. `
`I'll be there. `
`So if you try to 'see' me and try to talk to me, I'll definitely be able to answer. `
`...If you 'look' strongly and try to talk, that is." `
`"......I'll... `
`...give it a try." `
`"It isn't easy, okay? `
`It isn't going to go well all of a sudden, got it?" `
`"......I understand. `
`I'm sure it won't be easy. `
`...But I... `
`...want to be like you, Maria onee-chan......" `
`"Uu-. `
`I understand. `
`......Then, look at me well. `
`Look closely." `
`"...Okay." `
`"Slowly open and close your eyes. `
`...You can't shut them for a long time all of a sudden. `
`After burning my form into your eyes, try to make it blend into the inside of your eyelids..." `
`"......Yeah, `
`...I'm doing it." `
`"Once you can visualize me even when your eyes are closed, `
`......without changing anything, slowly and softly close your eyes again. `
`......How is it? `
`Can you still 'see' me?" `
`"...Y-Yes. `
`...I think...I can probably see you..." `
`"Then try opening your eyes for a second. `
`......Now for the real thing. `
`Calm your heart, and close the diary. `
`...At that time, my form may disappear for a second. `
`But calm your heart, and don't get anxious. `
`...And then, try to make the me that's blended into the inside of your eyelids blend back into your eyes. `
`...Slowly visualize me in the empty air. `
`...In the empty air, ...'see' me." `
`"......... `
`...Yeah, I'm okay. `
`............Right, `
`...I'll close... `
`...the diary." `
`"Uu-." `
`Slowly, `
`...I closed it. `
`When I did so, ...a gray reality filled with dull air unfolded. `
`Of course, Maria onee-chan's form disappeared. `
`...Give it all you've got, have courage. `
`...Take the first step into the world of witches. `
`I felt like Maria onee-chan was cheering me on inside my heart. `
`She's cheering me on? `
`Really? `
`Or do I just think that she is...? `
`No, that's wrong. `
`It's because I think this that {i:I cannot 'see' her}. `
`Maria onee-chan is always by my side. `
`And even now, she's definitely there, cheering me on to do my best... `
`That...reached my ears. `
`So I mustn't ignore it like it's my imagination or the voice of my own heart... `
`...I believe... `
`that Maria onee-chan is there. `
`I mustn't doubt. `
`...I believe. `
`Onee-chan said she'd always be by my side. `
`I must not doubt that... `
`But looking at that empty space, by the empty back wall of the school building, `
`amidst those almost heartlessly boring rays of sunlight, calling out her name was unexpectedly difficult... `
`The chains of common sense that had clung to me until today sneered at me, telling me that calling out to the empty air was ridiculous... `
`It was almost like being told to take a step forward off the roof of a skyscraper overlooking a sea of lights. `
`...It's Maria onee-chan saying it. `
`...It's all right, she's saying that I'm someone who can do it. `
`Stop thinking that you might fall, or that it'd be foolish to take a step off a roof, `
`...and free yourself from those chains of common sense......... `
`".........Whew...... `
`......haaah, ...... `
`............okay..." `
`I steadied my breathing. `
`I concentrated my mind. `
`Make the vivid form of Maria onee-chan in the empty space before you...rise to the surface. `
`......Understand magic, `
`...and 'see' Maria onee-chan... `
`"......Maria...onee-chan......!" `
`"Huh?! `
`Is someone there?!" `
`At that time, I was answered by a rustle in the bushes and a wild cry, and I came to my senses. `
`It looked like I wasn't the only one behind the school building. `
`No, since I'd been so immersed in the world of the diary, I hadn't noticed someone coming. `
`I recognized a group of three beyond the bushes. `
`...They were kids from my class. `
`From their appearance, it felt as though they'd come behind the school building to gossip about someone or talk in secret. `
`I hurried out of that place. `
`Because if it became known that I'd been alone in a place like this, mumbling to myself, it'd become a pain again... `
`"...She said it, right? She said it, right? `
`She said Maria onee-chan or something, right?!" `
`"Isn't that creepy? She isn't seeing spirits or something, is she?" `
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*! `
`Ushiromiya‐san is so~ funny...!" `
`I could hear the shrill, loud laughter from behind. `
`Irritated and feeling that Maria onee-chan had been made fun of, `
`I left that place at a quick pace, and then a jog once I turned the corner. `
`...And I might've made it to Onee-chan's world with just a little more time... `
`It was frustrating, aggravating... Why does everyone get in my way...? `
`I haven't gotten in anyone else's way, not even once...! `
`I ran and ran, but it still felt as though I could hear their shrill laughter... `
