`"3 months left to live. `
`It was last year when you said that, right, Doctor Nanjo?" `
`"...I-I only spoke of what I could comprehensively determine from his physical condition at the time. `
`As a result, this year too, it just so happens-" `
`"So, even though it's doubtful whether Dad'll last until the end of the year, he's still totally focused on his occult research. `
`And you still say he has only three months left, Doctor?" `
`"L-Like I said, Kinzo-san's-" `
`"Shouldn't you be happy that our respected father is still in high spirits? `
`Out of a sense of parental respect, each one of you is so eager to greet Father. `
`I can see how upset you are that he's unwilling to meet with you." `
`"...Considering that everyone has started aiming for the inheritance while the sun is still in the sky, `
`I can understand why Father wouldn't want to see you." `
`"Y-You've got it wrong, Natsuhi nee-san. `
`...We just, umm-" `
`"Dad isn't immortal, and he'll die someday. `
`We aren't telling him to die. We're just saying that he will die sooner or later. `
`We're just talking together about how to prepare for that." `
`"And that is precisely what is so disrespectful!!" `
`"Stop it. `
`You'll make your headache worse." `
`Krauss told Natsuhi, who had risen from her chair in agitation, to sit down. `
`Trying to smooth over the atmosphere, which had suddenly become filled with suspicion, `
`Hideyoshi put on a forced smile and motioned for everyone to calm down. `
`"...Natsuhi-san, don't misunderstand. `
`People say you should always clean up after yourself, right? `
`We're just talkin' about seein' him off. `
`We're discussin' this so we can see Father off neatly when he takes off on the journey he's eventually gonna make." `
`"Hahaha... `
`That's just like you, Hideyoshi-san. `
`Even though you're saying the same thing, you make it sound so intellectual." `
`"Yes, that's right. `
`Unlike you, Nii-san." `
`"Quit it. `
`We aren't getting anywhere. `
`......So like we're saying, Aniki, `
`forget all this about the inheritance. `
`I don't even care if Dad hits us." `
`"To make a long story short, we wanna meet Dad directly and say hello. `
`Even if he says he doesn't want to. `
`If he's locked up in his study, we don't care if we have to borrow a key from Genji-san. `
`Right, Rosa?" `
`"...Oh, ...well, umm...it's not like we're forcing you... `
`...It's just...we haven't said hello to Father in such a long time. `
`If his remaining life really is short, then there's a chance we might never be able to see him again... `
`...Today might be our final opportunity to exchange words with Father..." `
`"That's right, just like Rosa says. `
`If he only has three months left, it wouldn't be odd for him to pass away any time now, right? `
`Are you saying that despite that, we don't even have the right to talk with him one last time? `
`...Regardless of the circumstances, isn't that just a bit too much...?" `
`"...If greeting Father were truly what you wished to do, I'm sure he'd happily allow you to meet with him." `
`"But Father has already heard about the disrespectful topic you hope to raise! `
`No one would want to meet with you under those conditions. `
`The reason you cannot meet with Father is because of your own doing and nothing else, is it not?" `
`"Heheh. `
`Exactly. `
`You shouldn't have to rack your brains to understand why Father doesn't wish to see your faces, right? `
`Father has seen through all of your tight financial situations." `
`"......What are you talking about? `
`...I don't have a clue what you're going on about, Nii-san." `
`"Heheheheh! `
`Did you really think I didn't know about the state you're in...?" `
`Eva and the rest realized that he had seen through to their current lack of funds, `
`and alternating between bluffing and returning to the point at hand and arguing back, `
`they repeatedly pressed Krauss to let them meet with Kinzo. `
`...The sweet smell of the black tea Rosa had gone out of her way to buy had been completely wasted. `
`The only thing she was glad about now was that the children weren't here for this. `
`...The fact that they'd gone to play at the beach right after lunch had been their only salvation. `
`Eva made as though to tackle Krauss, and Hideyoshi and Kyrie cut in between them, trying to calm both sides. `
`...Then, Kyrie took a deep breath and spoke. `
`"......I'm sorry, Krauss nii-san. `
`I know I'm an outsider, but I wonder if you'd let me say one thing. `
`I have a proposition." `
`"What is it, Kyrie-san?" `
`"...First, and this includes my husband as well, `
`for many years, we have belittled the efforts you've made by living with Father and taking care of him. `
`...Isn't that right?" `
`"......That's...well... `
`...We've got it easy since we get to go outside, but Aniki's been babysitting Dad for decades now, and that must've been a lot of work. `
`...I'll accept that, but what's your point, Kyrie?" `
`"We must acknowledge that Krauss nii-san is Father's caretaker. `
`...Isn't that right? `
`We've always feared Father...and have pushed the task of caring for him onto Krauss nii-san. `
`Everyone should acknowledge his efforts. `
`Isn't that right, `
`Eva nee-san?" `
`"...... `
`...And so what? `
`Nii-san is Father's caretaker? `
`Don't decide things on your own, outsider!" `
`"H-Hey now, ...calm down. `
`...Kyrie-san, what are you talking about?" `
`"............ `
`...Kyrie, please continue." `
`"We should be more grateful towards Krauss nii-san and Natsuhi nee-san. `
`...We should thank them for always taking care of Father. `
`It's our lack of gratitude that's to blame for these wasteful conflicts we keep having. `
`...Isn't that right, Krauss nii-san?" `
`"......I'm surprised. `
`I did not think you, Kyrie-san, would be able to understand our efforts, `
`which even my true siblings have not stopped to consider." `
`"...It's a natural duty for the Successor to the Ushiromiya Family Headship." `
`"That's right. `
`It's your responsibility as the Successor to the Headship, isn't it? `
`...It's because you take care of Father that we must acknowledge you as the Successor." `
`"Hey!! `
`Why are you bringing this up all by yourself?!! `
`You're just an outsider-" `
`"Wait, Aneki!! `
`......That's right. `
`It's just like Kyrie says. `
`Because you take care of Dad, you're the Successor, Aniki. `
`It's just like you said." `
`"......Oh-" `
`"......Nn-" `
`Rosa noticed, and then Eva did. `
`Eva's barking demeanor towards Kyrie for advancing the discussion on her own disappeared in a flash, `
`and she instead stared at Krauss and Natsuhi. `
`...Natsuhi couldn't understand that sudden change and was slightly flustered. `
`"Krauss nii-san, `
`...if you'll accept just a few conditions, `
`we won't ask you to let us meet Father again until he dies. `
`Of course, we won't demand to be present at his deathbed. `
`...We wouldn't even mind being absent at the funeral." `
`"...Oh? `
`......Where are you going with this? `
`But I may as well listen for now. `
`Let's hear your terms." `
`"First. `
`...The term Successor to the Headship refers to the caretaker of the current Head, Ushiromiya Kinzo." `
`"......Hmm. `
`And then?" `
`"Second. `
`The duty of the caretaker is to look after Ushiromiya Kinzo for the rest of his life. `
`...To make things simple, the caretaker's job is to care for him until his final moments. `
`You were prepared to do that from the beginning, Krauss nii-san, so that won't cause any problems." `
`"Naturally. `
`I have no objections to either of those terms. `
`I am already carrying them out." `
`"Third. `
`On the off-chance that the caretaker is neglectful in his responsibilities of supervision, he shall be deprived of his rights as a caretaker." `
`With that sentence, all slack disappeared from Krauss's face. `
`...Natsuhi alone was still having trouble figuring out what it meant. `
`"...Hoh. `
`And just what are these... `
`responsibilities of supervision that the caretaker bears?" `
`"It means supervision so that Father can live the rest of his life in the best possible health. `
`...I'll be more detailed than that. `
`In the case that Father dies anything other than a natural death, the caretaker will be deprived of his rights as caretaker, and his status as the Successor to the Headship will be lost. `
`If that happens, the next highest in rank, Eva nee-san, will be selected as the Successor." `
`"......Wh-What did you say...? `
`How can you shamelessly speak such nonsense?!!" `
`"Hohoh. `
`My, my, the caretaker certainly has a heavy responsibility... `
`However, people can die in many ways. `
`For example, senile old people sometimes die when food gets caught in their throats. `
`Normally, this is called death by old age in its broadest sense." `
`"But with your argument, that becomes a death by accident, and I bear the responsibility of supervision. `
`...This is unjustly disadvantageous to me." `
`"I have no intention of forcing such an unfair argument on you. `
`I'm referring to the kind of thing that the caretaker could have prevented beforehand by taking good care of and keeping his eyes on Father." `
`"It may be the caretaker's job to carry food to Father's mouth, but whether he swallows it or not is clearly outside the caretaker's responsibility. `
`I would have absolutely no problems with the example you raise, Krauss nii-san." `
`"......Hoh. `
`So, what kind of case are you referring to that might cause the caretaker to be blamed for making a blunder?" `
`"For example, `
`......if he disappeared." `
`"...... `
`......Oh?" `
`"It seems that right now, Father is in firm control of himself, `
`but dementia might begin to set in." `
`"...He might wander around when you aren't looking and get into some kind of accident, `
`...or he might get lost in the forest and go missing. `
`...Wouldn't this type of case clearly be the responsibility of the caretaker...?" `
`"Father's mind is perfectly healthy! `
`There is no need to bring up dementia...!" `
`"'One day, suddenly, I saw Father go into the forest. `
`I chased after him, but I couldn't find him. `
`I called the police and searched, but after being unable to find him after seven whole years, I had him declared legally dead.' `
`My point is that we won't accept it if you use a story like that to treat him as dead." `
`"............" `
`"When Father passes away, an autopsy will certainly be carried out, `
`and we will confirm that he died of old age in the most general meaning, within the bounds of common sense. `
`...A death of any other cause will be held as the caretaker's responsibility. `
`.........See? `
`These are all things you have toiled away at all this time, Krauss nii-san. `
`These aren't strange conditions or anything of the sort, right...?" `
`"Y-You are mocking us, disgracefully so!! `
`I find it hard to imagine why my husband must be coerced into a rule that disgraces him in this way!!" `
`"......Actually, I've been suspecting it since last year. `
`No, everyone here probably suspects it as well. `
`Eva nee-san and Hideyoshi nii-san. `
`Rudolf-san and Rosa-san too. `
`Everyone has suspected it the whole time, but it was so frightening to imagine that no one actually said it." `
`"Hmph. `
`...Heheheheh, hahahahaha...!! `
`I see, so this is what you're trying to say? `
`...That Father is already dead, and that I have been hiding it!" `
`"...Ah, that's right. `
`That's one of the theories I thought of as a key to solve the last mystery in the previous game." `
`"......You mean the very last bit, `
`the mystery of who killed Doctor Nanjo?" `
`"That's right. `
`...The witch definitely said a lot in red. `
`...She mentioned the names of all 18 people and announced whether they were alive or dead, and then she claimed that there were no humans besides them. `
`...But with this theory, I can weave my way through that gap...!" `
`"...... `
`...I see. `
`So, this is one of the answers that doesn't cause those two to contradict. `
`......Makes sense." `
`"See what I'm saying? `
`...You catch on pretty quick. `
`It's nice that I don't have to explain." `
`"No 19th person exists on this island. `
`And yet this trick lets us mix in an unknown new character. `
`...In other words, "the names of all 18 people" don't necessarily correspond to "the 18 people on the island"." `
`"That's it...! `
`The witch mentioned the names of 18 people one after another, and announced whether they were alive or dead. `
`And on top of that, she announced that there were no humans other than the 18. `
`...There was a single illusion in there." `
`It was never guaranteed that {i:the 18 names = the 18 people on the island}. `
`"When she named off all 18 people and announced who was alive and who was dead, `
`she hid the name of culprit X, and instead mixed in someone who wasn't on this island...! `
`By doing that, even though the culprit was on the island, she was able to leave him out of the list of living or dead people! `
`The person who was mixed in wasn't actually on the island, so he didn't count towards the total number of people on the island." `
`"By this, even though the culprit counted towards the total of 18 people on the island, it was possible for his name not to be listed! `
`The two statements in red are completely independent, so this theory creates no contradictions...!" `
`"If someone's name was used to hide the existence of the culprit, that name must satisfy several conditions. `
`...First of all, even though this person isn't on the island, they've got to be someone we think is on the island. `
`...Otherwise, she wouldn't have been able to trick us." `
`"And it's best if this person happens to be dead. `
`...No alibi is more perfect than death. `
`After all, at that point, the mystery was based on the fact that the crime was impossible for all 18 people. `
`......Is it something like that?" `
`"Yeah, that's it...! `
`And, that person was... `
`Grandfather. `
`...Right now, there's only one thing Kyrie-san can be about to say. `
`...We thought Grandfather was locked up in his study, saying that he didn't want to meet anyone, `
`...but there's a possibility that he's actually dead already, `
`and that Uncle Krauss is lying when he claims that Grandfather's alive...!" `
`That's right. `
`Grandfather was closed up in his room the whole time, and no one saw his face! `
`Maybe he was already dead, `
`and Uncle Krauss and the others were conspiring together, trying to trick everyone...!! `
`"......If Kinzo dies, the distribution of the inheritance occurs. `
`However, if Kinzo doesn't die... `
`no, `
`if he dies, but {i:it isn't announced}, the distribution of the inheritance won't take place." `
`"In other words, Uncle Krauss could have all of Grandfather's wealth to himself...! `
`That's right, he's got more than enough motive!" `
`Maybe a 19th person X really doesn't exist on this island. `
`But a person X existed. `
`...And that person was the 18th person! `
`"In other words, there were originally 17 people on this island, not 18. `
`Then, an unknown person X snuck in and committed the crime. `
`...How's that, Beato?! `
`Come out, I've just solved the final, biggest mystery from last time!!" `
`As Battler claimed that forcefully, the crisp sound of clapping came out of nowhere, and their surroundings turned bright, `
`becoming the usual witch's tea room. `
`"*cackle* Hahahahahahaha...! `
`<Bravo, bravo>. `
`I wish I could deny that someone as incompetent as you has finally gotten a feel for it, but somehow or another, you've managed to come up with a single answer. `
`Even a lump of concrete can stop thinking! `
`So, you have now finally evolved into a being with intelligence." `
`"...You might say you've finally taken a step forward from the crying creature you were before, just licking my shoes and grinding your teeth. `
`*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"...I can't believe that stupid wordplay threw me for so many loops last time. `
`My lameness pisses even me off!" `
`"All right, Beato, repeat it!! `
`If you can announce that the 18 people on the island included Grandfather, just try and do iiiiiiiit!! `
`Yeah, you can't. `
`Because he was already dead. `
`This is the end of your deceptiooooooooooon!!" `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* Ahhahahahahahahahahaha...!! `
`Well now, what have we here? `
`......Shall I slice that in two with the red truth? `
`No, no, it might also be good to hold back for now and let you get all excited. `
`If I'm going to push you off a cliff anyway, it would be more interesting to lure you to a higher place first. `
`*cackle*!" `
`As Beato sneered obnoxiously, she looked like she was searching for an expression that would tick me off even more. `
`...As though she was saying that the answer I'd reached was impossibly ridiculous. `
`Compared to me, annoyed as I was with the witch's attitude, Gretel had a blank and composed expression on her face. `
`...Almost as though she'd expected the witch to act that way. `
`"......... `
`I see. `
`...Just like how Battler has learned and grown, so has the witch." `
`"What's wrong, Beato?! `
`Don't act so tough!! `
`I asked if you can repeat it! `
`Answer!!" `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*..." `
`"...Stop it, Battler. `
`The witch won't answer so easily. `
`...She won't do it until she thinks it'll benefit her." `
`"What?! `
`What do you mean...?" `
`"You've been toyed with by this red truth in the games up until now, so the witch has used it many times. `
`But now, the situation is different. `
`You're trying to draw the red truth out of her...and are instead using it as your weapon. `
`In this situation, there's no way the witch will keep firing off the red without reason. `
`......Right?" `
`"Gretel, or whoever you are. `
`...It seems your mind is quite sharp, unlike Battler's. `
`What a fearsome enemy I've welcomed in. `
`That is correct! `
`When Battler hopes I'll use the red truth, do I have any responsibility to do so?!" `
`"No! `
`I don't even have a crumb from that croissant you ate this morning's worth of responsibility to please yooooooou!!" `
`"Y-You bastard......!!" `
`"Yes yes yes yes, that's the faaaaace! `
`I started playing with the red truth just because I wanted to see that face! `
`I have no reason to play around if it won't give me a chance to see you look like that...!" `
`"...Heheh. `
`You just don't like losing, right? `
`Just saying whatever you can to trick me because you can't answer my demand won't work!!" `
`"Don't be so full of yourself!! `
`An answer like that could be cut to pieces without any effort!! `
`But I won't go out of my way to speak in red. `
`I won't say it because that's what you're asking me to do. `
`Do you know why?" `
`"......You just said it. `
`You want to push him off at the sweetest spot. `
`This ill-natured witch is saying she won't use the red anymore, because that's what you want. `
`In other words, she won't go along with this game of telling her to repeat things anymore." `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`Exactly, exactly! `
`Unlike Battler, everything goes quickly with this girl, with no need for explanations! `
`I will say what I please with the red truth, at the time that I desire!" `
`"That's it. `
`Basically, it's the witch's right to use the red truth as she pleases. `
`She doesn't have to use it at whatever time the human side desires. `
`......But even that depends on the situation." `
`"...The situation...? `
`What do you mean...?" `
`"The witch has no responsibility to respond when you tell her to repeat something. `
`But it does become her responsibility if and only if your claim can destroy the witch theory. `
`After all, in this trial court without a judge, that which is not refuted becomes the truth." `
`"...Just like how the witch theory made by the witch...... `
`will instantly become truth if you collapse and stop thinking." `
`"Then, ...since she doesn't have a counterargument for my guess, that means it's right?! `
`It's right that the culprit is the mysterious 18th person X, and Grandfather is already dead?!" `
`"...At least, until the witch argues back. `
`Truth always loses to new truths farther in the future. `
`...The tricky part is that even the timing of the counterargument is up to the witch." `
`"...In other words, maybe your reasoning just now was correct, `
`or maybe the witch is refraining from arguing back even though you're wrong. `
`...Or, the witch may be ignoring it because it doesn't shake the basis of the witch theory in the first place, `
`but either way, we can't tell the difference at the current time. `
`......Is that more or less it?" `
`"*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*! `
`Damn you, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, for throwing in such a troublesome piece. `
`Thanks to that, I'm losing all my lines!" `
`"The witch has learned that she can respond to your demands to repeat phrases at a later time. `
`...Maybe you could even call it a delayed move." `
`"...Sh-She's messing with me... `
`...So, even if I announce some mistaken reasoning, there's a possibility that Beato will intentionally let me flounder about without denying that guess, `
`and at the very end, when I propose an even more massive line of reasoning, she can cut it off at the base, `
`and spin everything around...?!" `
`A single piece of reasoning becomes a bridge to the next piece. `
`By demanding that she repeat lines, I've been able to strengthen my position and advance bit by bit. `
`But since that bastard Beato learned this strange delay tactic, `
`...I can no longer confirm or deny my reasoning. `
`This is like finally finding a staff that'll let me search around in the darkness, only to lose it right away. `
`...I'm just stuck now, right...?!! `
`"Hey, hey, Battler, if you make a despairing face like that, I won't be able to stop drooling, you see{p:0:♪} `
`From the beginning, that staff was nothing more than something I gave you because you were so worthless. `
`All this means is that you can finally challenge me without a handicap, right? `
`Kuhihihihihihihihi!" `
`"...But that alone doesn't change the fact that demanding that you repeat things is one of Battler's ways to fight back. `
`As I already said, as long as it's something fatal that'll destroy the witch theory, `
`the witch is obligated to argue back, and therefore, to speak with the red truth. `
`...While the timing of that counterargument is up to the witch, it must be performed eventually. `
`......Isn't that right?" `
`"Hmm, that may be so. `
`If I cannot deny the "tricks done by humans" theory Battler lays out by the time the game ends, `
`Battler will use that as a reason to deny me, and it will be possible for him to proclaim his victory." `
`"...So, should we view this as a restriction on the witch's side...? That the "trick theory" laid out by the human side, `
`in other words, what he tells you to repeat, must be countered during the game (during the episode)?" `
`"That is so. `
`...Battler's goal is to show that he can explain the entire pleasant game I have laid out on this island with humans and deny me. `
`If Battler succeeds in that, at that time, he will become the victor of this game." `
`"Let me confirm the rules. `
`...Should we view the time the game ends as referring to 24:00 on October 5, 1986, going by the time of the Rokkenjima in the game?" `
`"I have no problems with that." `
`"At the time the game ends, the human side must state a theory using tricks for all of the mysteries, `
`and if the witch side cannot argue back, the human side can proclaim its victory. `
`...Does that work?" `
`"......Let us be more specific. `
`When the game ends, the witch side will be given a chance to argue back." `
`"Let's decide on an amount of time. `
`One minute. `
`If you cannot carry out your counterargument within one minute, victory will be proclaimed." `
`"Then allow me to impose the same rule on you. `
`At the time the game ends, the human side will be granted one minute to counter the mysteries it has been given. `
`If even a single mystery has not been countered within that time, it becomes the witch's victory, and that game is over. `
`...It would be such a killjoy to have the game stopped for lengthy consideration, right?" `
`"......You asshole. `
`Moving things along without me... `
`But I more or less get what's going on. `
`Even if the lines I demand that you repeat aren't countered instantly, they've gotta be countered eventually." `
`"Yes, that's right. `
`...And that must happen before 00:01 on October 6. `
`...But be careful. `
`She only has to cut up one of the things you tell her to repeat. `
`You can't proclaim your victory unless you solve all the puzzles." `
`"Just as I can use the red, `
`from now on, I will allow you to use the blue, Battler." `
`"When explaining my magical murders with human tricks, you may state your claims in blue. `
`I am responsible for countering your blue with the red by the end of the game." `
`"Blue... `
`...So I'll talk in blue when I tell you to repeat things...?" `
`"Not quite. `
`When you told me to repeat lines, you were able to do it for any trivial thing. `
`But the blue is a little more restrictive. `
`Unless it by itself denies witches, it will not be valid." `
`"............" `
`It's starting to get confusing, ...but it's more or less something like this. `
`For example, let's take one of the riddles in the past where I asked her to repeat something. `
`"The actual number of master keys is 5." `
`That had been to confirm that there really were 5 master keys, when she claimed there were no more than 5. `
`But since that by itself wouldn't deny witches, I can't say it in blue. `
`So, in order to speak in blue, I'd need to say something like this... `
`'The actual number of master keys was greater than 5. `
`The culprit entered or exited the room with that extra key!' `
`...Only then would the witch, who claimed that this was a closed room murder made with magic, be responsible for making a counterargument. `
`In other words, I can't demand that she repeat something that merely confirms the premises of my reasoning. `
`......That'll probably be a significant disadvantage for me. `
`Crap... `
`It's enough to make the red Beato used to toy with me until now look extremely merciful... `
`"...Damn it. `
`So even if I create a theory for a particular closed room and speak it in blue, `
`if Beato denies it at the very, very end, I won't even have time to create my next theory...?! `
`This rule's awful, horribly bad for me..." `
`"......Are you gonna surrender before the fight begins again? `
`Calm down. `
`No one said you could only use the blue once for each mystery. `
`Do you know what that means?" `
`"N-No. `
`...What does it mean...?" `
`"In the pitiful way you've been fighting up until now, you've made a single theory, glanced at the witch's complexion, `
`and if that one didn't work, you'd then start making another theory. `
`You won't corner a witch like that." `
`"Then how should I fight...? `
`......You don't mean..." `
`"Yeah, that's right. `
`...You don't attack her riddles with a point. `
`{i:You assault them with a wall}. `
`You said so yourself in an earlier game, that the force of your reasoning should be like that." `
`Assault...with a wall. `
`That's right, I said so myself earlier. `
`Guessing and trying to expose the mystery is like trying to shoot a distant target with an arrow. `
`Until now, I've just been shooting off arrow after arrow, `
`asking the witch if I scored a hit, `
`and then preparing my bow again once I'm told that I've missed. `
`There's no way I'll hit at that rate... `
`Bullets might be a better example than arrows. `
`If you take one shot after another at a distant target with a handgun, you probably won't hit it easily. `
`...So how can you hit it? `
`If a handgun doesn't work, `
`...use a shotgun! `
`Instead of a single bullet, beat her down with "shot" comprised of countless projectiles at once...! `
`Shot scatters, so it impacts a wide area. `
`That makes it optimal for shooting small, fast targets like birds. `
`That's right, there's no rule that says I have to guess like a pistol, shooting one shot off at a time. `
`...Making a single theory and just hoping that it hits is no better than stopping your own thinking. `
`Blast away with a massive number of bullets, of guesses, and make them impact like a wall, so that only one of them hitting the target is enough. `
`"......Blue, huh...? `
`...I get it. `
`If your red truth is a razor-sharp katana, then it looks like my blue is a shotgun. `
`No, ...a machine gun whose firepower'll turn the witch into a honeycomb." `
`"I see, so it's an awkward gun that fires many shots. `
`*cackle*cackle*! `
`That sort of crude analogy is just like you." `
`"The climax of a detective novel is always the same. `
`...The famous detective gathers all the suspects at once and displays a single trail of logic that works splendidly. `
`Almost like William Tell spectacularly shooting through an apple with a single arrow. `
`That's why I mistakenly took that to be a virtue." `
`...It probably would be splendid. `
`If I could shoot through the truth with a single guess. `
`But, that isn't realistic. `
`Look at real wars. `
`Do they really have everyone pull long guns out of the trench, aim reeeally well, and take shots at each other one at a time? `
`They don't, right?! `
`They fire rapidly, they fire all over the place, they pin down the enemy with a barrage! `
`Reasoning is the same way. `
`Because of that weird virtue, I've been stuck thinking it's better to take one line of reasoning at a time. `
`We humans can fire off countless guesses and possibilities! `
`The bullet is the power of imagination. `
`Suspension of thought is a clogged barrel...! `
`The pathetic way I've been reasoning up until now is like a peashooter. `
`I've been so lame, weakly firing off shots, getting them denied in red, and then taking the next bullet and reloading. `
`My "blue truth", which claims that humans and tricks are what's real, `
`will overpower its target, the illusion told by the witch, with its firepower and the force of what I can imagine...! `
`This is... `
`Ushiromiya Battler's fighting style...!! `
`"......Thanks to you, I've figured out my true fighting style. `
`Thanks, Gretel!!" `
`"You're welcome." `
`"Makes me think of how pathetic I was before. `
`...Yeah, it's like Beato said. `
`I've had a handicap up until now. `
`I'll acknowledge that...!! `
`New rule, understood!! `
`I have my own way of fighting! `
`I'll show you it!!" `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!! `
`That willpower is good, I like it! `
`Then, try using it right away, this blue truth of yours...!!" `
`"...Yeah, I'll use it. `
`With this blue truth, I'll break apart your witch theory, which states that only a witch culprit was possible because everyone had alibis!!" `
`"This is my truth! `
`{p:2:Ushiromiya Kinzo is already dead}. `
`{p:2:Therefore, the true number of people on the island is 17}! `
`{p:2:By adding an unknown person X to that, it becomes 18 people}. `
`{p:2:By supposing that this person X exists, the crime is possible even if all 17 people have alibis}!!" `
`"...In short, if you keep preventing us from meeting with Father, we will have to accept the following theory. `
`Simply put, Father is already dead. `
`But you're hiding that because you don't want the inheritance to be distributed." `
`"......... `
`...Ridiculous." `
`"Th-That is correct, this is worse than ridiculous!! `
`I have never heard such an insult!!" `
`"It'd even be possible for us to check by force whether he's alive or dead, with the police there to witness it. `
`Isn't that right, Eva nee-san...?" `
`"...Y-Yes... `
`That's right, Nii-san. `
`There are all sorts of ways we could set you up. `
`We could easily arrange for a situation where you'd have to hold a meeting with Father under the supervision of a third party...!" `
`"Still, `
`I think that would bring a lot of shame to the Ushiromiya family. `
`That's why I'm making this proposal. `
`Here we have the responsibilities and duties of the caretaker. `
`And a penalty in the worst-case scenario. `
`If you consent to those terms, we'll be able to refrain from doing something like dragging Father outside." `
`"...Yeah, that's right, Aniki... `
`Didn't you just say it yourself...? `
`You're carrying out your natural duties as Dad's caretaker. `
`Kyrie's conditions shouldn't be anything to worry about, right? `
`Why this overreaction?" `
`"...Are you really that worried about having the position of Successor dragged out from under you if Dad dies something other than a natural death?" `
`"Or else, what? `
`Do you have some reason to think Father might die something other than a natural death...?" `
`"How could I? `
`...I see, now I too understand how Father feels. `
`How pitiful his later years have been for him, unable even to die as he pleases." `
`"Yes, his later years truly have been pitiful. `
`...And the thought that these "later years" are already something of the past is exactly what we're suspecting." `
`"...You could completely clear this suspicion away just by letting us meet with Father. `
`...So, even after being humiliated by us this much, you still won't allow us to meet with him, Krauss nii-san......?" `
`"............" `
`"Father is probably already dead. `
`The corpse may have been disposed of in absolute secrecy. `
`...And after taking all of the wealth for yourself as Father's agent, `
`you will make it seem that he "disappeared" until seven years pass, making Father a corpseless member of the deceased." `
`"......I'm sorry, but please don't take it badly, okay? `
`I'm just playing detective here." `
`"...H-How rude can one be?!! `
`You have no right to stay in this mansion!! `
`Leave immediately!! `
`I won't permit you to cross the threshold of this house again!!" `
`"It worked last year, but you've used up your luck if you thought it'd work this year too. `
`...Father is in a bad mood, so he can't meet with us? `
`That was plenty suspicious last year, and yet you're doing it again." `
`"If you really wanted to fake being Father's agent and grab up all his assets, you should've done it a little more speedily, `
`making him disappear without waiting for today's family conference. `
`You really are naive, Krauss onii-sama..." `
`"......I have no idea what you are-" `
`"However! `
`...If it's a fact that Father's in a bad mood, `
`and you're preventing us from meeting him as part of your responsibilities as his caretaker, then it's a very wonderful thing you're doing. `
`In that case, if you just accept our conditions, everything will be settled here and now." `
`"......After all, you care so greatly for Father, Krauss nii-san. `
`There's no way Father will die in a manner that leads to trouble during the autopsy." `
`"After all, Father hates hospitals, so he'll pass away in his study, right? `
`An autopsy will certainly be carried out no matter what happens. `
`......The only way to {i:kill him without an autopsy} would be for him to disappear." `
`"......Enough, Kyrie-san. I think you've bullied Nii-san enough." `
`Eva rebuked Kyrie in an sickeningly kind voice. `
`...Considering the situation, that was impossible. `
`...Which is why it was sickening... `
`"I'm sure Nii-san has his own difficulties to worry about, as well as his pride. `
`True, Nii-san might consider that one of his natural duties, `
`but if you force him to put it on paper and assign penalties, `
`...I could hardly blame him for getting upset. `
`Don't you agree, Rosa...?" `
`"...Yes, that's right. `
`......She might have made light of Krauss nii-san's pride as the eldest son a little too much. `
`...I'd feel bad for him if we were to force him to sign a statement regarding the duties of the caretaker as Kyrie-san has laid them out." `
`"That's right. `
`You're doing a good job, Aniki. `
`Taking that into account, we might consider avoiding all that about signing strange papers and worst-case penalties... `
`and leave everything to you." `
`"...Y-You people......" `
`Not just Eva, but Rudolf and Rosa as well, with unnerving smiles on their faces as though they'd planned this beforehand, began closing in on Krauss. `
`They now understood perfectly how Kyrie had cornered Krauss...and exactly where she was prepared to compromise... `
`"...We were talking about a signed statement regarding the responsibilities of the caretaker. `
`But, even without signing such a thing, you can make it so that we'll never demand a meeting with Father again. `
`...If you can prove your fitness as Father's caretaker with a form of guarantee other than a signed statement, that is." `
`"Are you telling me......to pay security money? `
`Hehheheheh, hahhahahahahaha...! `
`Hilarious! `
`Wahhahahahahahahahaha!" `
`"The security money will be paid to Eva-san, Rudolf-san, and Rosa-san, 3 billion yen each. `
`As a deposit, you will transfer ten percent of that, 300 million yen, before the year is out." `
`"9 billion?! `
`I don't have that kind of money!!!" `
`"After Father passes away, you should be able to work it out. `
`We've managed to investigate at least that far. `
`You should be able to handle the deposit of 900 million yen in your current financial situation." `
`"And it should even be possible for you to {i:borrow it from Father}, right? `
`...There's no need for obvious charades anymore." `
`"......H-How unpleasant. `
`Truly unpleasant...!!" `
`"I-It is at that!! `
`Even just the discussion of Father's inheritance was far too disrespectful! `
`Father is already dead? `
`My husband is hiding that and keeping all the money for himself?! `
`I have had enough of this!! `
`None of you are qualified to bear the name Ushiromiya any longer!!" `
`"Calm down, Natsuhi-san...! `
`We've all said all we need to! `
`Why don't we leave it at that for now...?! `
`This is happinin' all of a sudden and on a massive scale. `
`We might even be gettin' agitated ourselves!" `
`"Why don't we take a break for a while and cool our heads? `
`Krauss nii-san probably needs a little time himself. `
`Right, Krauss nii-san?" `
`".........Time...? `
`And why would I need something like that?" `
`"Don't worry, don't worry! `
`We aren't thinkin' of anythin' shady! `
`We're just so eager to see Father that we've started grumblin' a bit...! `
`And Krauss nii-san, I know reeeal well how you're dyin' to get back at us for the things we've said...!" `
`"If you're willin' to go so far, then you just need to let us meet with him! `
`Right? `
`Isn't that right? `
`You just got a bit stubborn, and it felt awkward to say you'd let us see him after sayin' we couldn't all those times. `
`Isn't that it? `
`Right? Right?" `
`"...I-It certainly does seem that my husband has lost his composure slightly, just like the rest of you have. `
`...We were only refusing stubbornly out of respect for Father's desire not to meet with everyone." `
`"......... `
`...Indeed, that's right. `
`It was turning into another sibling fight like the old days, and I started feeling stubborn as well. `
`......Let us cool our heads. `
`...I understand how much you all want to meet with Father. `
`...I will pass that on to him. `
`......I'll find some way to convince Father to meet with you. `
`......Will that do?" `
`"...Yeah. `
`I think it'd be okay to give Krauss nii-san some time to persuade Father." `
`"Yep. `
`...We're counting on you, Aniki. `
`Please persuade him to meet with us. `
`After all, you're Dad's caretaker." `
`"And as for persuading him, ...let's set a limit on it to sometime tonight, okay? `
`When tomorrow comes, we'll confirm Father's well-being, even if we have to break down the door to his study. `
`......You have no problems with that, I take it? `
`Nii-san...?" `
`"...Do as you like. `
`I see, it seems even the time I've been given to persuade him is short. `
`...Let us go, Natsuhi. `
`We shall ask him to join us for dinner at least." `
`"R-Right...!" `
`Krauss left the parlor with Natsuhi. `
`Once their footsteps disappeared, `
`Hideyoshi took a deep breath, smirking and flopping onto the sofa... `
`"......Kyrie-san, `
`...you're...a frightenin' person." `
`"Sorry for speaking out of turn. `
`I apologize." `
`"...No, no. You didn't corner him like we'd originally planned, but in the end, this was even better. `
`...Just like always, I've gotta bow my head to you..." `
`"But...can he really prepare 900 million...? `
`I believe we estimated that 750 million would be the most Krauss nii-san could afford with his current financial situation... `
`...Isn't 900 million gouging him too much...?" `
`"If he can't do it, that's fine too. `
`If we do something like lowering it to 750 million so Krauss nii-san can save face, it'll look like we're compromising and it'll be easier to settle, right? `
`And if he really does come out with 900 million, that's even better." `
`"Nii-san is probably having a strategy meeting with Natsuhi-san about now. `
`...It really will be interesting to see what kind of twisted logic our proud Nii-san comes up with as an excuse." `
`"Convince Father...? `
`There's no way he can." `
`There's no way to convince someone who isn't even there...! `
`"......The siblings have all come, despite their various circumstances, for this annual family conference." `
`Krauss and Natsuhi could be seen in Kinzo's dimly lit study. `
`Every once in a while, thunder could be heard, and the dimly lit room flickered with light. `
`...It seemed that the island would be closed off by the storm very soon. `
`"...Father...! `
`Please, just this once, show those disrespectful people the majesty of the Head...!" `
`"It's useless......" `
`The large shadow of a person standing by the window, his majestic back facing them, `
`...answered quietly and forcefully. `
`He hung his head and shook. `
`...Eventually, they could hear a mumbling laugh over his shoulder. `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* Hahahahahaha!! `
`It's useless, it's all useless...!! `
`Wahhahahahahahahahahaha!!" `
`......Three months left to live...? `
`An almost finished geezer...? `
`To whom exactly are you referring? `
`"You foooools!! `
`Did you wander over here because your siblings threatened you? `
`Know your shame!!" `
`As Kinzo turned and brushed his cape, it flashed forcefully through the room's stale air. `
`That air pressure truly signified Ushiromiya Kinzo's majesty and willpower itself. `
`After being blown back by that wind, it wasn't strange that Krauss landed on his butt. `
`As though showing consideration for Krauss, who looked as though his legs had been swept out from under him, Natsuhi also crouched down. `
`Then, `
`...with a *thunk*, `
`...*thunk*, `
`Kinzo's footsteps approached with a heft that signified his dignity. `
`"...F-Father......" `
`"Yoou fooooooooool...!! `
`I heard from Kanon. Just how far did you pathetically let your siblings lead you around by the nose?!?!" `
`"F-Father...! `
`My husband is doing his best to protect your honor..." `
`Without lending an ear to Natsuhi's words, Kinzo extended his palm to Krauss's collar, as the latter sat on the floor. `
`...No, he curled his fingers, leaving only his pointer finger out, then took that finger and... `
`pressed hard into Krauss's collar, `
`...twisted it, `
`.........and slowly, `
`with just one finger, `
`...picked Krauss up into the air. `
`"...You really are a pathetic fooooooool. `
`...You let your wife speak in your defense? `
`If you have an excuse, give it yourself!!" `
`"Gaggahh, .........gwah...!!" `
`Krauss clawed at the air. `
`Kinzo's brawny finger was choking him. `
`He couldn't even open his mouth, much less talk. `
`However, even if he had been able to open his mouth, `
`as he was now, there was no way he'd be able to think up an excuse that Kinzo would accept... `
`Still, ...how could this power be described...? `
`No one would call Kinzo an old man after seeing this superhuman strength... `
`"...Father...!! `
`My husband is fighting in his own way...!! `
`Please, forgive him...!!" `
`"......Natsuhii. `
`...Fighting is a process you go through before winning. `
`...The process you go through before losing isn't called fighting." `
`"That's called being pathetic!! `
`Wahhahahahahahahaha, you call this my successor? `
`Wahhahahahahahaha, wahhahhahhahahahahahahahhaaaaaaah!!" `
`As thunder roared, Kinzo laughed heartily as though nothing could be more pleasant. `
`And when he finished laughing, he threw his son away like he was scrap paper, `
`slamming him against the wall... `
`"Gwah, ...uuuuuuuuu..." `
`"Dear, dear...!! Are you okay..." `
`Krauss slid down the wall, rubbing his throat as though in pain... `
`Natsuhi ran up to him and looked after him... `
`But without showing any interest in the two of them, `
`Kinzo returned to the space near the window, as though he had been there the whole time, and looked up at the thunderclouds of misfortune. `
`"......I thought I would have no regrets in my life, if only I could meet {f:5:Beatrice}, `
`but it seems it won't go so smoothly. `
`...It was promised from the beginning that nothing received from the witch would remain. `
`However, the Ushiromiya name is not the property of the witch. `
`...Who is fit to succeed that name? `
`It seems that this alone must be resolved by my own hand. `
`...Rejoice, Krauss!! `
`I have changed my mind." `
`"......F-Father... `
`......So...?" `
`"I have no desire to have dinner with you cowards. `
`However, I will attend the family conference afterwards!" `
`"F-Father... `
`Thank you very much...!" `
`"There, I shall make a great announcement regarding the succession of the Head. `
`I will resolve your foolish quarrel myself!! `
`Uuhhahahahahahaha, waaahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahah!!!" `
