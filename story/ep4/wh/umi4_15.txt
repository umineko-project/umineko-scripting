`"......A test...?" `
`"...Y-Yes. `
`Listen well..." `
`Once again, there was a call from Krauss to the guesthouse. `
`...And the message was...that Kinzo wanted to hold a test to see if the grandchildren had the qualifications to become his successor. `
`"......The Head has said that his successor will not be one of us siblings... `
`That he wants...to pick from among his grandchildren..." `
`From Krauss's restrained style of speech, Jessica realized as his daughter that he was being forced to speak. `
`And she was forced to realize that the hostages were being exposed to danger even now, `
`and that if they refused this test, there was a possibility that the hostages would be harmed. `
`"Th-Then, `
`......what should we do?" `
`"...I-Indeed. `
`Hold on..." `
`Krauss put down the receiver, then looked at the grinning Kinzo on the other side of the bars. `
`Kinzo gave his next order. `
`"Before the test, those not involved must be removed. `
`......Gohda and Kumasawa are there, I believe? `
`It will be a problem if they interfere with the test. `
`Banish them from the guesthouse." `
`"......Banish, ...you say...?" `
`"There should be a gardening storehouse in the rose garden. `
`Lock Gohda and Kumasawa in there. `
`Hmm, we'll begin from there. `
`Tell them to do it immediately. `
`......My weapons will be watching. `
`If they happen to do anything questionable, I'll instantly stop the test and execute all of you as sacrifices!" `
`"...I-I understand... `
`...Hello, Jessica...? `
`Listen closely to what I say..." `
`Krauss relayed the orders to lock up Gohda and Kumasawa... `
`"...What kind of test are you planning?" `
`"Hmm? `
`Aah, it truly is a simple test. `
`I only want my grandchildren to show me their resolve. `
`Well then, I wonder what kind of results they'll show me. `
`...*cackle*." `
`Looking disgusted, Kyrie watched Krauss, who was talking with the children. `
`...I hate it, but for now, we cannot refuse orders. `
`In this dungeon, a feeble resistance won't amount to anything. `
`If we provoke him too much and drive him into a position where he might kill us, `
`there will no longer be any way to stop this murderer. `
`...For now, the only choice left is to obey his rules without agitating him, `
`...all the while waiting for an opportunity... `
`However, if we continue to obediently follow his commands, `
`the children might be attacked in this so-called test, and they might even lose their lives. `
`......Whether we feign obedience or try to resist, ...nothing will cause the situation to improve. `
`Anyway, straining our eyes so that we don't let a single chance escape until the very end...is the only resistance possible now. `
`...While telling herself this, Kyrie watched over Krauss as he delivered Kinzo's orders... `
`"......Kyrie-san, `
`let us be patient..." `
`"I understand. `
`...It's unfortunate, but all we can do right now is wait. `
`If only we could do something about these bars, we'd be able to return to the mansion..." `
`"...If only we could somehow get out of here... `
`...I-I'll try something. `
`.........Kinzo-san, I have a request." `
`"Hmm, what is it, my friend?" `
`"We understand well that you want to test the children... `
`...It is fine for you to do as you desire." `
`"Without your power, the Ushiromiya family might have been destroyed long ago. `
`We truly understand why you want to carefully select the person who will take charge. `
`Besides, that is what the family conference is all about. `
`We won't get in your way..." `
`"Hmm. `
`Your insight is useful. `
`That's right, this is the family conference. `
`The final family conference, where I will select my successor. `
`Fuhahahaha...!" `
`"And yet, Kinzo-san, `
`...it is far too cold here. `
`Since we won't interfere with your test, couldn't you take us to a slightly warmer place...?" `
`"........." `
`At Nanjo's words, the slight signs that Kinzo's mood had been improving were blown away. `
`Nanjo was struck with a moment of silence as Kinzo gazed at him with dangerous eyes, as though appraising him... `
`"...Certainly, this place is cold. `
`It's tough on an old body. `
`...Master, `
`wouldn't it be all right if we moved them upstairs...?" `
`"I cannot do that!! `
`Are you naive, Nanjoooooo...? `
`So, by acting as though you'll skip this turn, you truly and splendidly advance your strategy? `
`I'm not falling for that, you seeeee...? `
`If you're freezing, then why don't I line the floor with red hot coals!!" `
`"M-My apologies..." `
`{f:5:Virgilia} had tried to help out, but in the end, Kinzo would not comply... `
`".........You two sure are obedient. `
`...If you felt like it, you could easily break these bars." `
`"..........................." `
`"...Even if we break them, nothing will come of it." `
`"Of course. `
`...If you were to break these, it would mean the end of {f:5:Goldsmith}'s game. `
`...All of you, as well as those humans in the guesthouse, would immediately become sacrifices for Kinzo's ceremony." `
`"...But, surprisingly, you two might be the only ones, yes? `
`Perhaps only you two hold the power to break out of this situation, ...right?" `
`"......You want to reach the Golden Land, don't you? `
`You must have many dreams you want granted, right...? `
`*cackle*cackle*..." `
`"..............." `
`"Gaap, `
`you musn't provoke them. `
`...This is not your game. `
`It is the Master's, as well as Milady's game." `
`"......What is it, Ronove?" `
`"Oh, no, nothing. `
`...We were talking to the prisoners. `
`Forgive us." `
`Gaap sent one final sneering smile at Kanon, then turned away. `
`Kanon could only bite his lower lip and shake his fists... `
`"............ `
`...Dammit......" `
`"...You did well... `
`Good job hanging in there..." `
`"We're powerless... `
`Because we're furniture..." `
`"That's right, ...we're powerless. `
`...However, furniture is sometimes relied upon...and even loved. `
`...Right now, we've only been stored away in the basement. `
`...Surely, one day, somebody will love us. `
`Because they'll rely on us. `
`...That's why, for now, let's ignore their provocation and bear with it... `
`...Okay?" `
`"...Father, `
`I've ordered them to lock up Gohda and Kumasawa in the storehouse." `
`"Very well. `
`Hang up now. `
`...Chiester Sisters, `
`observe the grandchildren as they lock Gohda and Kumasawa away. `
`If they do anything suspicious, ...then in that moment, the selection test for my successor will be over." `
`When Kinzo made his order, the Chiester Sisters appeared behind him in a line. `
`"Understood, sir. `
`...I will scout. `
`{ruby:Five‐five‐six:556} and 410 will cover both flanks. `
`45, you're on wide-area surveillance." `
`"00, `
`556 is..." `
`"Ah, ......that's right. `
`Sorry." `
`"She was a good kid..." `
`"...That's why I don't like them nyeh. `
`...Good people." `
`"What are you doing, Chiester Sisters?! `
`Follow my orders!" `
`"......My apologies, sir. `
`Then, let us go observe. `
`...Move out!" `
`The Chiester Sisters erased their forms simultaneously. `
`Nanjo and Kyrie had witnessed the instants they appeared and disappeared as if by teleportation, `
`but they interpreted this as moving in and out of the darkness in a way that only looked like teleportation, `
`and the two could do nothing but rub their eyes... `
`"...Well then, `
`I shall begin the preparations for the test. `
`Ronove, Gaap, `
`I'm asking you to be the examiners. `
`{f:5:Virgilia}, you'll watch these rats. `
`......After all, two of my furniture are here. `
`Just in case, be on your guard." `
`He glanced at Shannon and Kanon. `
`Tightly closing her eyes, Shannon gave a silent bow and answered wordlessly, avoiding any unnecessary actions... `
`"...Certainly. `
`I'll be careful." `
`"Isn't this cold hard on your old body, Lia? `
`Should I bring you a hot water bottle...?" `
`"Shut up. `
`Go quickly. `
`Gap!" `
`"Pukukuku...! `
`Well now, what a strange experience this game is, to have a test and examiners. `
`......I do hope this development entertains Milady." `
`"...Come, arise, goat attendants." `
`{f:5:Virgilia} began to call out into the darkness, and from that spot, three massive goat-headed attendants suddenly appeared. `
`"Ah, Beato's minions. `
`How convenient. `
`Plus, they seem so warm. `
`I see, so you'll use them instead of a hot water bottle. `
`In that case, wouldn't sheep have been better than goats?" `
`"You're the one wearing cashmere. `
`...They aren't very bright, but they faithfully follow orders and are quite dependable." `
`"Indeed, I leave it to you, `
`my friend, {f:5:Virgilia}. `
`...The rest of you, follow me." `
`With a dignified gesture, Kinzo fluttered his cloak. `
`Following him were Ronove and Gaap, `
`...as well as the three recently summoned goat attendants. `
`"...Hey, you three are supposed to wait here with me. `
`Don't follow them." `
`The goats jumped in surprise and then came tottering back. `
`Kyrie, who had been watching stunned as all of this played out, couldn't help but snort. `
`"Heheh... `
`What entertaining underlings." `
`"L-Lord {f:5:Goldsmith} did not give you permission to speak." `
`...She was probably embarrassed. `
`{f:5:Virgilia} had spoken coolly, but Kyrie saw through that, and for a little while, she couldn't restrain her muffled laughter. `
`However, on the inside, Kyrie was surprised at the number of people Kinzo had with him. `
`After all, including Kinzo himself, at least 10 enemies had already been spotted... `
`...The dungeon they were currently locked in was supposedly underneath the hidden mansion called Kuwadorian. `
`Although this mansion had been whispered of, not even Krauss had known of its existence until today. `
`Are there actually several facilities like this on Rokkenjima, `
`where many unknown henchmen that only Kinzo knows of hide...? `
`Just how many humans are on Rokkenjima, locked away by the typhoon...? `
`No, on the contrary... `
`Were we the only ones under the impression that there were only 18 people on this island...? `
`Were we, who bickered over whether {f:5:Beatrice} existed or not and worried about whether a 19 person existed or not, `
`nothing more than the frogs in a well on this island...? `
`No wait, not only that... `
`By now, are there actually more people on the enemy's side than on ours...? `
`"......Just what the hell is going on...? `
`Witches? Demons? Magic? `
`...Are you telling us to believe in those? `
`Are my eyes screwed up? Or is it my head? `
`...I think I'm losing it......" `
`A mass murder by magic. `
`Demons forming and disappearing into thin air. `
`Setting aside the enemy's numbers, `
`how should we interpret the various things thrust before our eyes that cannot be explained with the common sense of our world? `
`...Kyrie started to feel like she didn't know what was going on anymore, `
`and while desperately battling the urge to abandon everything and give up, she grit her teeth and tried to hold onto her sanity... `
`Obviously, Gohda and Kumasawa were quite unwilling to be locked in the rose garden shed. `
`...But they were threatened that, if they resisted, the hostages' safety could not be guaranteed... `
`It was fairly hard to get them to agree, `
`but once they started thinking that their safety might actually be guaranteed if the key to the gardening storehouse was to be handed to them after being shut inside, `
`...and when it was decided that blankets and food would be carried in for them, they were finally convinced. `
`"......This place is pretty chilly... `
`I wonder how long we'll have to stay locked in here..." `
`"...It could be as late as Monday morning at the worst, so a full day and night. `
`...I really feel bad about doing this to you two..." `
`George and Battler cleared a space on the floor, then spread the blankets there. `
`They also left the canned food, crackers, and other light snacks they had brought. `
`"It'll be hard for you guys to go until Monday with just this... `
`If only we could make a trip to the kitchen..." `
`"They said not to go anywhere we weren't told to. `
`...Sounds like we're being watched. `
`...Damn." `
`"...I am honestly sorry that we cannot be of any use... `
`And these are the times that we are truly supposed to be at your sides..." `
`"It can't be helped. `
`...More importantly, take care of Kumasawa-san. `
`We don't know what might happen. `
`If the going gets tough, I'd like you to play it by ear and come to the rescue. `
`And more than anything, I want you to be safe..." `
`"...Yes, I understand. `
`...Please be careful, everyone. `
`Right now, the Master...is taking human lives like they're pieces on a chessboard. `
`...Please look out for yourselves." `
`Gohda stared at the floor, even now unable to believe what had happened as he remembered that atrocity in the dining hall, `
`and he hung his head in shame at his failure to fully describe that terror. `
`"Thank you. `
`...Make sure you stay on your guard. `
`You too, Kumasawa-san." `
`"...And you all please take care as well... `
`I don't have any idea what's going on anymore..." `
`"Well then, ...we'll be off. `
`Let's go, Battler-kun, Jessica-chan. `
`...Come on, you too, Maria-chan." `
`"......Uu-." `
`Looking at the pitiful expressions on the imprisoned pair's faces, it got really hard to close the shutter. `
`But we can't disobey. `
`...We're being watched. `
`The shutter was brought down and locked. `
`Then, George walked toward the small window on the side of the storehouse. `
`At that side, there was a small latticed window that could only admit light and ventilation. `
`It looked like something from a jail, making the two of them seem even more pitiable, `
`...but on the other hand, it would hopefully protect them from Kinzo and his subordinates... `
`He opened the window and called out. `
`"...Are you okay? You aren't cold, are you?" `
`"We're okay. `
`You've given us so many blankets, after all. `
`......If we wrap ourselves up, we'll be just fine." `
`"I wish we could've brought them a kerosene stove or something..." `
`"...But it wouldn't have ventilation here. `
`It'll probably be tough for them, but there's nothing we can do now. `
`...Hostages are being held against us. `
`We can't disobey..." `
`"...Dammit... `
`...If we manage to save Kyrie and the rest somehow..." `
`"Shh. `
`...They might be listening. `
`...Gohda-san, here. `
`It's the key to the shutter." `
`George threw the key in through the tiny window. `
`"...Indeed. `
`I'll hold on to it." `
`Gohda took the key, showed it to Kumasawa, and placed it in his own pocket. `
`There's only one key to the gardening shed's shutter. `
`That key was being held by the ones locked up inside it. `
`If the children had kept it...and had it stolen from them by some chance, that would do nothing but expose the lives of those in the shed to danger. `
`And even with the key, the shutter could not be opened from the inside. `
`Kinzo's demands were fulfilled this way. `
`However, there was now no longer any way to open the shed from the outside either. `
`This protected them. `
`Kinzo had ordered that they be confined, ...and we could do nothing but trust that this cold closed room would protect them. `
`Jessica watched this while holding Maria's hand, then looked over the thickets in the pitch-black rose garden. `
`...Somewhere in this darkness, somebody was hiding, watching to see whether we obeyed orders or not. `
`Of course, when we pointed our flashlights out there, no suspicious silhouettes appeared. `
`But somebody was surely out there, ...hiding and watching. `
`I was hit many times with an urge to scream at them. `
`...But I was able to hold that urge back through reason. `
`The four children left the area, repeatedly looking back over their shoulders. `
`The light from the faint lightbulb in the gardening storehouse was seeping out slightly. `
`...I wonder if this insane incident will come to an end somehow...so that we can meet those two again. `
`...To George, who had closed the shutter himself, `
`...the resistance of the lock had made it feel as though he'd killed them with his own hands. `
`"...But even so, ...we can't defy them..." `
`"What's with this test...? `
`...Damn geezer, don't screw with us...! `
`Killing Mom, capturing Dad for that... `
`I don't get it, I'll kill him...!" `
`"...It's okay, Jessica onee-chan. `
`There's nothing to be sad about..." `
`"...Maria..." `
`"Soon, the witch will be revived. `
`...Soon, we'll be able to meet in the Golden Land. `
`...Kihihihihihihihihi... `
`Ouch." `
`"Don't laugh indiscreetly like that. `
`...Seriously, a resurrection ceremony for a witch? `
`...Getting so many people involved... `
`in delusions he should've just kept inside his head. `
`...That's gonna cost you, ...bastard..." `
`"...Let's return to the guesthouse. `
`...It'll be bad if we aren't there when Grandfather calls." `
`Urged on by George, everyone began walking towards the guesthouse... `
`At that moment, Jessica turned in a circle, facing towards the darkness of the rose garden, and roared. `
`".........HEY!! `
`Someone's watching, right?! `
`Tell the old man...!! `
`Tell him I'm gonna fuckin' kill him!! `
`Let's go...!!" `
`Of course, there was no reply, only the howl of the wind and rain... `
`The children returned to the guesthouse... `
`...While fearing what was waiting for them up ahead... `
`After they left, `
`...from the exact point in the darkness that Jessica had yelled at, `
`two rabbit ears sprung up... `
`"...S-Sorsorsorry...! `
`They found me ouuuut...!!" `
`"It's because you're too slow nyeh. `
`Ni~hihihi~, Pendragon‐sama's going to scold youu~{p:0:♪}" `
`"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please don't tell Pendragon-samaaaaaaaaaa!" `
`"Be quiet. `
`It was obviously just a bluff. `
`...Gohda and Kumasawa's imprisonment confirmed. `
`Mission complete. `
`We'll report back." `
`"Ya-i, ya-i. `
`Nihihihihihihihihi! `
`Ouch." `
`"Do you want us all stuck on nothing but carrots and water because of collective responsibility? `
`...Let's go." `
`The fact that they were being watched certainly seemed to be true. `
`Because, when they returned to the cousins' room, turned the lights on, and laid down on their beds, the phone rang again. `
`Earlier, Jessica had been answering the phone, seeing as this was her house, `
`but now it was the eldest, George, who picked it up. `
`This time, Kyrie-san was on the other end of the line. `
`George handed it to Battler out of consideration... `
`"......Hello. `
`Kyrie-san? `
`Is everything all right over there...?!" `
`"Thanks for worrying. `
`...At the moment, we're all doing great here. `
`...............Sorry, I've been ordered to refrain from idle chatter. `
`Listen to what I'm about to tell you." `
`The fact that they were hostages still hadn't changed. `
`Kinzo or one of his subordinates was listening to the conversation. `
`Battler restrained the urge to talk about other things...and focused on what Kyrie had to say. `
`"The test will be carried out by Jessica-chan, George-kun, Battler-kun, `
`and Maria-chan, in that order. `
`...You'll each be summoned in turn, so until then, do not leave the room. `
`When someone's called out, they'll head to their designated location, alone." `
`Battler repeated it out loud, so that the cousins listening in around him could hear. `
`"...So it'll be Jessica, Aniki, me, and Maria, in that order, and we've gotta stay in the room until we're called, right? `
`...Got it. `
`...Maria too? `
`Even a nine-year-old girl... What's the damn geezer trying to force us to do, that bastard...?" `
`"......The fate of the Ushiromiya family rests in all of your hands. `
`...Do your best." `
`"...Nng. `
`......Sure." `
`Battler noticed the strange nuance in Kyrie's words. `
`Even without any blood connection, he could still understand thanks to the long-lasting bond they shared. `
`At this point, it doesn't make sense to worry about the Ushiromiya family itself. `
`...That probably wasn't the message Kyrie wanted to send. `
`She probably meant 'There's no way for us to escape from this dungeon, and we can only wait to be rescued. `
`Our lives are in your hands.' `
`...Something like that. `
`"Yeah, leave it to me. `
`We don't know what kind of test it is, but no problem. `
`I'll take it gladly. `
`......It's gonna be a serious test, right? `
`...Should we really... `
`go all out?" `
`"...Yes. `
`It's a serious test. `
`Grandfather truly does intend to test you all." `
`"It's useless, it's all useless. `
`...Some old fart on death's door is gonna give me a serious challenge? `
`Let him spout nonsense after he gets in the coffin. `
`I know he's there, so tell him this for me: `
`I'll be your successor. `
`And my first action will be to shove my fist into your face...!" `
`Even without Kyrie having to repeat it, Battler's powerful declaration of war reached Kinzo's ears... `
`"Fuhahahahahahahaha!! `
`Battleeeeer, I am truly looking forward to thaaat! `
`I can't wait to see just what a man who once threw away the Ushiromiya name has attained, `
`just what lot in life he's reached when he appears before me!! `
`Tell him...!" `
`Unfortunately, Kinzo's voice was not picked up by the reciever. `
`Therefore, Kyrie spoke for him. `
`"It sounds like he's more than up for the challenge. `
`...Got that, Battler-kun? `
`There's no need to hold back. `
`......You are Rudolf's son. `
`...No, you are my son. `
`Show me something I can brag about to anyone. `
`......I leave everything in your hands." `
`"Understood, Mom. `
`......Leave the rest to me...!" `
`"......All of us here have lost the right to inherit the position of Successor. `
`...Now, we're just the same as pieces taken off the game board looking on from the outside. `
`So you'll have to fight by yourselves." `
`".........Kyrie-san......" `
`The nuance of those words was......... `
`'We've already given up, `
`...so forget about us.' `
`...But...for that very reason, I won't give up... `
`I'll definitely crush this test or whatever...and save everyone...! `
`"In that case, here are his instructions for the first test, Jessica-chan's: `
`...Go to your room." `
`"Really, go to your room? What's your game, you damn geezer..." `
`"It seems he means Jessica-chan's personal room, the one in the mansion." `
`"...I'll hand it over to Jessica. `
`Tell her directly for me. `
`...Jessica, here." `
`"H-Hello... `
`......Yes, I understand..." `
`"......Starting with me, huh...? `
`...Well, I've been ready. `
`See ya later!" `
`Even Jessica was probably tempted to succumb to the fear of a girl her age. `
`...But she crushed those feelings and strengthened her resolve. `
`"Be careful, ...okay?" `
`"...We're probably being watched, right? `
`We can't do anything. `
`All we can do is exactly as we're told." `
`"...They say that old geezer killed those six in the dining hall instantly, with no hesitation. `
`...So, if we try to fight back, we might end up the same way." `
`"I know. `
`......I'll beat them at their own game." `
`"Don't do anything reckless. `
`...If you think you're in any danger, your own safety comes first. `
`...If Uncle Krauss finds out that his daughter sacrificed herself for him, `
`there's no doubt it'll tear his heart apart." `
`"It goes the other way too. `
`......If Mom and Dad are both killed, and I'm the only one left, `
`my heart will rip itself to pieces." `
`"............... `
`...Battler-kun, `
`what you said earlier is true, right...?" `
`"Yeah. `
`......Kyrie-san and the others are already...prepared for what will happen." `
`"Then, ...the way things are now is just perfect. `
`...Everyone's lives rest on our shoulders. `
`The hostages can't do anything while they're locked up. `
`That means we'll have to manage something ourselves." `
`"......If something happens, run back to the guesthouse. `
`At that time, we'll be done playing along with Grandfather's game." `
`"Aniki......" `
`"At that time, we'll declare war. `
`......Wherever they're locked up, we'll save them, and we'll deal with Grandfather accordingly." `
`"... Are you sure, Aniki? `
`...Shannon-chan's there too." `
`"............ `
`...That's why I'm saying it. I'm not sitting around and waiting for my fiancée to be killed. `
`......What scares me is not that Shannon might be killed by Grandfather." `
`"I'm just worried {i:you guys'll get there first} and clobber the damn geezer who made my fiancée experience terror before I do." `
`"I see... `
`...This really does sound like a test to see who'll be the Successor." `
`"Yep. `
`...The first one to bury a fist into that old face will be the next Head." `
`George, Battler, and Jessica each forcefully nodded their heads and put their fists together. `
`Then, Jessica headed off to her own room, as designated... `
`Her form disappeared into the darkness of the rose garden waving in the strong winds. `
`...Watching her go, George and Battler gripped their fists even tighter, making them quiver... `
`Left on the second floor, Maria watched Jessica's back through the window. `
`She wore a blank expression... `
`"...I wonder what everyone's getting so upset about. `
`......Even though when {f:5:Beatrice} is revived, everyone will be brought back to life." `
`Jessica's form was already being completely swallowed up by the darkness. `
`...At that time, the phone began to ring again. `
`Battler and George heard it and came clamoring back, but Maria picked up the receiver right away. `
`".........Hello." `
`"...I-Is that Maria-sama...? `
`It's me, Shannon. `
`...Would you please hand the phone to George-sama?" `
`This time, it was Shannon on the phone. `
`And this time, the message was to tell the next person, George, where he was to go... `
