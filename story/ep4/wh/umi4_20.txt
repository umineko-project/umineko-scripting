`......I don't have a clue what's going on. `
`Please, someone explain in a way even I can understand...what happened yesterday. `
`I was in the kitchen of the mansion, grabbing some food without permission. `
`If you open up that massive business-class refrigerator, you can find anything. `
`You can eat and drink as much as you like. `
`...Even if the typhoon didn't clear up for a week, I'd have more than enough to eat. `
`With wine in one hand, I was helping myself to some dry-cured ham. `
`I wonder just how expensive this wine and ham are. `
`You ingredients are out of luck too. `
`If only you'd had Gohda-san to cook you, you could've been reborn as much more incredible food... `
`I looked at the clock. `
`Very soon, it would be 24:00. `
`October 5, the second day, would end. `
`......The insane October 4, yesterday, seemed like a lie. `
`...That's how much...nothing had happened after that test thing. `
`Nothing happened. `
`No phone call came, and no letters came. `
`No person came, and no one attacked me. `
`Nothing happened at all. `
`I wanna start demanding a refund on all the time and energy that tension stole from me, `
`......because after that, for an entire day, a full 24 hours... `
`...Nooothing happened. `
`So surely, nothing's gonna happen now. `
`......A full 24 hours ago... `
`...{f:5:Beatrice} called me to the spot in front of the mansion's entrance. `
`There, I was given a strange test to determine the Successor to the Headship or whatever. `
`I gave a serious answer in my own way, but it somehow hadn't meshed with the other side. `
`{f:5:Beatrice} got pissed for no reason and fell silent. `
`I yelled at her to try and say something, but she gave no answer. `
`When I asked where Maria was, she just told me to go to the chapel and left. `
`To tell the truth, it was an anticlimax. `
`...No matter what kind of weird test you give, at least tell me whether I've passed or failed. `
`Are you trying to say "Thanks for coming, your results will be mailed to you later" or something? `
`...Quit messing with me. `
`Anyway, I then headed to the chapel. `
`...After failing their tests, both George-aniki and Jessica were killed. `
`I couldn't let Maria get killed too. `
`...Also, I might get a chance to catch some person trying to kill her. `
`As a little kid, I often heard from Jessica that you'd get in trouble if you went near the chapel, `
`so I'd never been there, but I at least knew where it was. `
`I couldn't find any trace of a person there, `
`......but there was a key bundle lying in front of the door. `
`I thought this might be someone telling me to open the door, but after trying all the keys, I found that none of them fit. `
`I also called Maria's name, but there was no answer whatsoever. `
`I searched around the chapel, but there was a limit to what I could do in the pitch black with just a flashlight. `
`I realized that this key bundle might be a set of master keys, which could make it possible to open the door to the mansion. `
`I found no sign of Maria, so I returned to the mansion. `
`The mansion was wrapped in silence. `
`And, in a horrible stench. `
`However, it's amazing how good humans are at adapting. `
`The inside of the mansion must still be wrapped up in that smell. `
`However, I grew completely used to it and stopped minding it. `
`It didn't seem any worse than any old house where someone had burnt some meat. `
`At first, I was bewildered by the stench, but I decided to head to the dining hall for the time being... `
`and found those corpses that were so pitiful, Gohda-san and the rest had hesitated to speak of them in detail. `
`It was the remains of Aunt Natsuhi and the others who'd become the first victims. `
`Half of each head had been completely split open, `
`and it was so gruesome that even without knowing a thing about examining corpses, I could say that they were 100% dead... `
`...And on top of that, the remaining halves of their faces were left like normal, so it was even easy to identify them. `
`...Really convenient corpses, these were. `
`And in addition to those six bodies...was one more. `
`This seventh corpse......was Maria. `
`She lay next to Aunt Rosa, as though sleeping alongside her. `
`......I cried. `
`At the death of an innocent young girl. `
`And at the cruel way my dad and the rest had died. `
`I raced through the mansion swinging the hat-stand spear, yelling "Come out here, bastard". `
`...But I couldn't find any trace of anyone else. `
`Thinking they might be planning to hide somewhere and attack me from behind, I went around searching for hiding places, `
`sometimes growing more cautious, `
`and sometimes intentionally letting my guard down in various ways, but in the end, not even a kitten appeared... `
`Then, morning came. `
`...My tension and fatigue combined with my drowsiness, making for the worst kind of dawn. `
`Humans are pretty incredible. `
`...Even when a murderer might been hiding somewhere, we prioritize drowsiness and fatigue over our own lives. `
`...By that time, I was starting to feel pretty ridiculous. `
`After all, for a full six hours before dawn, I'd walked around the mansion, yelling at the culprits to show themselves. `
`My search had been a careful one, and I'd tired myself out and let my guard down. `
`Even so, no one came to attack me. `
`Basically, I lost patience with them and figured they could do whatever the hell they wanted...... `
`The boat won't come until the typhoon passes. `
`They said on TV that it won't pass until tomorrow, so I've got another full day today. `
`Lazing about lost its interest, `
`...and even though I knew it would probably make the police mad, I decided to play detective a bit. `
`First was the dining hall, where the very first murder had occurred. `
`The six who had been killed in the beginning really were pitiful. `
`...The weapon used was probably a gun. `
`Maybe their heads were split by something powerful, like a magnum bullet or a shotgun. `
`It was a reasonable theory to hold. `
`Compared to that, the seventh corpse, Maria, had died in a much better and cleaner way. `
`At a glance, I could see no external wounds and didn't understand how she'd been killed. `
`But by her mouth were traces of bubbles that she might've spat out, `
`and it looked like a typical death by poisoning that you might see in a TV drama. `
`Wasn't Maria called out to the chapel and given a test...? `
`...So why was she in the corpse-filled dining hall, lying next to her mother, dead...? `
`Even if the cause of death was poison, ...who gave it to her? `
`Her clothes weren't disturbed at all. `
`It's hard to imagine that she was forcibly pushed down and given an injection of poison. `
`......It's probably better to assume that she was given a capsule of poison or something and made to swallow it. `
`But compared to the scattered and violently mutilated corpses in this room, Maria's corpse was too clean. `
`If they had a gun, they only needed to pull the trigger. `
`But poisoning, whether by having her drink it or by an injection, would take a lot more effort. `
`Considering the culprit's brutal nature, you'd think Maria's death alone was given special treatment. `
`Why was only Maria given a sleep-like death? `
`......True, being killed is always a pitiful thing, `
`...but for some reason, Maria's death alone seemed very courteous to me... `
`Both of Maria's hands were joined on her chest, as though the dead person had put them there herself. `
`...Did Maria do that herself before dying...? `
`...Isn't this usually something done by someone else after the person dies...? `
`As though sleeping with her mother, whose head was half crushed, Maria dozed in peace. `
`...For some reason, that contrast really bugged me. `
`Including the direct cause, it's probably safe to say that Maria's death is shrouded in mystery... `
`And more than anything else. `
`The biggest mystery of this dining hall...was the "pitfalls". `
`...The "pitfalls" that both Uncle Krauss's group and Gohda-san's had mentioned. `
`After the first six were killed, five more fell through "pitfalls" and were captured. `
`......What are pitfalls? `
`Those things that suddenly open and you fall through them, right...? `
`The room had a solid floor with a carpet that looked dignified, if a bit worn out. `
`...No matter how you looked at it, it was single piece. `
`If a pitfall had opened up, there would have to be a seam just in that place. `
`...And, if there had been some trick like a pitfall, wouldn't it creak when you walked on it?? `
`No matter how much I walked around, feeling the carpet, I just couldn't imagine that a pitfall was hidden here. `
`Anyway, it'd be one thing if a single person fell, but a full five people did. `
`...By putting together everyone's stories, each one of them had fallen from a different location, `
`so at the very least, there had to be five separate places with pitfalls. `
`......So what does this mean? `
`Was this room actually made with pitfalls across the entire floor, `
`so by pushing a button, you could open up a pitfall in the location of your choice, ...some kind of contraption like that?? `
`That kind of ridiculous mechanism would be surprising even in a ninja mansion. `
`...But if Dad and the rest had heard about this, `
`I wonder if they'd say "I wouldn't put it past Grandfather to do it, to make it". `
`...At any rate, I didn't learn anything more from the dining hall. `
`Do the pitfalls not exist? `
`Or do they exist, but I just can't find them, amateur that I am? `
`I can't say for sure. `
`Since they claimed that the pitfalls were there, `
`...I can't ignore them, even if I can't find them... `
`The next ones to be killed were Jessica and George-aniki. `
`I'd discovered George-aniki when I'd been called out for my test. `
`He had been called out to the arbor in the rose garden...and, probably, shot in the forehead with a gun. `
`Jessica had been called to her own room on the second floor of the mansion. `
`The door to her room was locked. `
`But that wasn't a problem at all, since I had a master key. `
`Inside the room, ......it was horrible. `
`...But after the dining hall, I was used to corpses, ...so I'd built up a bit of an immunity. `
`The phone receiver was loose and dangling. `
`...Had she been killed while still on the phone with me? `
`Jessica was leaning against the wall right next to it, `
`...with half of her head split open. `
`As far as I could tell by glancing at the scene, ...it looked as though she'd been killed while on the phone. `
`In that case, had the culprit been right there before her eyes? `
`......I hadn't gotten that impression when listening to Jessica's voice over the phone. `
`I'm pretty sure Jessica said... "They got me". `
`It's probably best to assume that she'd already received a fatal wound at the time of the phone call. `
`That's right, and she also said this. `
`"When you come, Battler, I'll be a corpse with half of its head split open." `
`Yes, that's what she said. `
`......From what I could tell by looking at Jessica's corpse, there were no wounds on her other than the damage to her head. `
`Could she have had an injury serious enough to make her prepared for death, and then died halfway through the phone call? `
`But the way she'd talked on the phone made me think that she'd escaped harm for the time being. `
`You shouldn't be able to have a casual conversation over a phone if the culprit's right before your eyes. `
`So, did the culprit come in partway through the phone call and kill Jessica...? `
`......No, that can't be right. `
`After all, this room was locked. `
`...Wait, that doesn't tell me anything. `
`...If the culprit stole a master key from one of the victims, locking the door would be meaningless. `
`But she had no external wounds other than her head. `
`......In that case, should I assume that the fatal wound she was prepared to die from and the actual external wound that damaged her head were two different things, `
`and that both of them were made to the same part of the body? `
`In other words, Jessica was struck severely to the head...and received an incredibly bad wound. `
`Then she called me...and either lost consciousness or died while on the phone. `
`Then, the culprit came and damaged her head again, ...something like that. `
`After being called to this room, Jessica was attacked by the culprit and received a serious injury. `
`Then, the culprit thought she'd been killed...and went away for the time being. `
`...But Jessica miraculously started breathing again...and called me with what would become her dying message. `
`Then, the culprit realized that they'd failed to kill her...and rushed back to deliver the final blow after Jessica fell unconscious from massive blood loss... `
`......That seems to add up, more or less. `
`Except for how Jessica was able to accurately predict the nature of that final blow. `
`And, there was one more thing that bugged me about the phone call from Jessica. `
`Jessica had said this... `
`"George nii-san's done for too. `
`That was...an instant death." `
`...She said it almost as though she'd witnessed George-aniki being killed. `
`But while you certainly could see the rose garden from the window in Jessica's room, `
`and you could even see the roof of the arbor where George-aniki had been summoned, ......it was very far away. `
`Add on the fact that it was the night of a typhoon, and it's very hard to imagine that she was able to witness everything that happened by the arbor from this window. `
`...And more than anything else. `
`Jessica left before George-aniki. `
`So she shouldn't have known that George-aniki's test took place by the arbor. `
`Why did Jessica know...that George-aniki had been killed...? `
`......Also, during my search of the entire mansion, I found Kyrie-san's corpse as well. `
`It was in one of the old guest rooms, at the back of the first floor. `
`In the past, before the construction of the guesthouse, the relatives had spent the night in these. `
`...Kyrie-san's situation matched Jessica's perfectly. `
`She'd probably been killed during her phone call with me. `
`The receiver was hanging untidily, ...and Kyrie-san lay crumpled in that corner. `
`But the way she had been killed was very different from Jessica. `
`Her head wasn't smashed. `
`...Instead, a stake with an occult design was buried into her forehead. `
`...It was so gruesome, ...so I pulled it out. `
`After pulling it, I realized that this might get me into trouble with the police later. `
`So, a little too late, I set it down by Kyrie-san's side. `
`Its tip was sharp and stained with enough blood that it must have penetrated fully to the brain. `
`I didn't know what kind of metal it was made of, but it was about as heavy as a paperweight. `
`Certainly, if you were stabbed all-out with something like this, it might cause a terrible wound. `
`......I...probably knew what that stake meant. `
`...It's one of those. `
`The style of killing from the fourth twilight onwards in the witch's epitaph. `
`...It's probably that "gouge with a stake and kill" thing. `
`However, a human skull is very firm. `
`......No matter how much someone mustered their strength, could it really have been pierced so neatly...? `
`No. `
`...By my reasoning, this stake wasn't the cause of death, but had just been used to damage the corpse after death. `
`She was probably killed with a gun or something, like George-aniki, `
`......and the stake had been stuck into the hole left by the gun. `
`...Thinking of it that way makes it easier to accept. `
`But...was Kyrie-san really killed with a gun? `
`As she said on the phone, even though she was holed up inside a locked room, Kyrie-san was being attacked. `
`In fact, this room had been locked. `
`...Also, `
`...she mentioned a golden thread or something flying in and attacking her. `
`In fact, there were four places around Kyrie-san's corpse with holes that could have been caused by some kind of attack. `
`.........But still... `
`a golden thread attacked her... `
`...through the keyhole...? `
`I looked at the door from Kyrie-san's perspective. `
`If it had been one of those old keyholes you see in old mystery movies, `
`where you can peek through to the other side, then it would've clearly been possible to stick something through it. `
`But even though the doors in this mansion were old-fashioned, the locks were the familiar, average cylinder style that you could find in any normal house. `
`...In other words, they weren't constructed in a way that would let you penetrate through them. `
`So no matter how thin an object you might try to stick through the keyhole, `
`it's unthinkable that something penetrated through from the outside and attacked. `
`......A cylinder lock. `
`......And a keyhole......? `
`But despite that, Kyrie-san definitely said that something like a golden thread had flown in through the keyhole, `
`...spun around while aiming for her, and attacked her... `
`"A golden thread attacking through a keyhole". `
`......I couldn't understand what it meant at all. `
`But, even so... `
`...Kyrie-san probably predicted that I wouldn't be able to understand all this. `
`And it wasn't just Kyrie-san. `
`Jessica said it over the phone too. `
`...No, since the very beginning, from the time we talked with Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san and got the phone call from Uncle Krauss's group, `
`...everyone has said the same, consistent thing. `
`......Grandfather summoned witches and demons...and is killing people with magic. `
`They'd been shown that right before their eyes. `
`These weren't tricks or fakes. `
`There was no choice but to believe it. `
`...With one voice, they had all said that. `
`When the mystery woman calling herself {f:5:Beatrice} appeared, `
`even I had pretty much believed that she was a real witch and might start summoning goat monsters right and left. `
`...However, after being left alone for a whole day, my feeling of tension had faded completely. `
`I was now able to think that something so stupid definitely couldn't be true. `
`Did they lose their heads a little in an extraordinary situation where their lives were exposed to danger......... `
`and mistakenly think that a witch was attacking them with magic? `
`......But multiple people gave the same kind of testimony, and on top of that, none of their opinions conflicted each other. `
`...If it had just been a single statement, I'd be able to suspect that they just didn't see what they thought they saw, `
`...but doing that now is pretty...difficult... `
`Then, right next to the back door, I found Uncle Krauss with his head half smashed. `
`...Even though he'd escaped the dungeon of Kuwadorian... `
`and somehow made it this far by a secret underground passage, ...he had been killed. `
`Buried into the gruesome cross-section of his half-crushed head... `
`was a stake with an occult design, like the one that had been buried into Kyrie-san's forehead. `
`And in this situation, it was very hard to imagine that this stake was the weapon used. `
`...He had been killed with a powerful gun like the six in the dining hall, `
`and after death, had been jabbed with a stake like Kyrie-san. `
`I wonder if the golden threads that Kyrie-san spoke of attacked Uncle Krauss too. `
`Does there exist some kind of tool, like an endoscope, that's very thin but can be moved about at will......? `
`And that can also attack people...? `
`No way. I've never heard of anything like that. `
`But even so, ...if this fact had been revealed to one of the relatives, `
`maybe they'd say "I wouldn't put it past Grandfather to make it"... `
`Since I can't deny the existence of golden thread X that can be moved at will and attack people, `
`I can either accept that this mysterious weapon exists, or else... `
`I'll have to accept that this was a murder committed with magic. `
`To find the next corpse, I had to go out through the back door and search around outside a bit. `
`Behind the mansion, in the wild-grown bushes that were almost swallowed up by the forest, there was something like an old well, `
`...and right next to it...were Doctor Nanjo and Shannon-chan's corpses. `
`Both corpses had their heads smashed. `
`...And, though they weren't stuck in, there were stakes lying right next to each damaged head. `
`...Each corpse was atrocious, but having to look directly at Shannon-chan's lovely face, which had been half blown away, was very painful... `
`Then, there was the well. `
`I'd heard that inside it was a secret underground passage to the mysterious mansion, Kuwadorian. `
`...By this time, I'd begun to think that {f:5:Beatrice} and her accomplices might've used this underground passage... `
`and left for Kuwadorian. `
`Even though there had apparently been at least ten of them, I hadn't seen a trace of anyone. `
`...It seemed very likely that they'd already escaped to a different location. `
`There's the typhoon. `
`They can't go out to sea. `
`It goes the same for the forest. `
`There's no way they could traverse such a deep, uncultivated forest on foot. `
`In that case, they had only one place to go. `
`The mysterious hidden mansion, Kuwadorian. `
`...Through the secret underground passage at the bottom of the well...! `
`...By this time, I had entirely lost my fear of being killed if I happened to come across the enemy. `
`Don't fuck with me...! `
`This time I'll storm into your mansion...! `
`"......Ah, ...wh-what the hell...?! `
`...D-Damn it...!!" `
`The old well had a firm cover on it. `
`The cover was an iron grill. `
`The gaps between the bars were perhaps 20 centimeters across. `
`You could peer inside, but it really wasn't something a human could pass through. `
`If I hadn't known better, I wouldn't have thought it anything more than a simple cover to prevent falls. `
`...But from what Kyrie-san had told me, I knew that its purpose was to prevent intruders from entering the secret underground passage in its depths...! `
`But the cover was extremely firm and rigid, and no matter how much I pushed or pulled, I couldn't even get close to opening it. `
`I couldn't find any obvious lock. `
`It might be sealed by some mechanism. `
`But no matter how much I investigated it, I couldn't find anything to release it. `
`......The biggest piece of information Kyrie-san had tried to give me, gambling her final moments, ...was the underground passage in this well...! `
`"Don't think I'll be stopped by something like this cover...! `
`I'll smash it to bits...! `
`I'll search for a tool...!" `
`I had an idea. `
`...After all, I'd seen the various tools in the gardening shed when we'd locked Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san in there. `
`But the shutter to the gardening shed was locked. `
`On top of that, the key was with Gohda-san, who was dead on the inside. `
`...In other words, this gardening shed was a closed room. `
`There's no way to open it from the outside. `
`In that case, I've got to break the shutter. `
`There has to be a tool for that somewhere. `
`...Kinda feels like I'm going in circles here. `
`Then, while searching for that, I learned that the source of the stench that had permeated the mansion this whole time...was the underground boiler room. `
`The boiler room was dimly lit, humid, smelled horrible, and on top of all that, was incredibly creepy. `
`But there were several large tools there, and I managed to find a fire hatchet and some massive wire cutters. `
`And......Grandfather's corpse. `
`No, strictly speaking, I should probably say that I found a burnt corpse of a person who was probably Grandfather. `
`Someone's corpse had been stuffed into the blazing fires of the boiler... `
`However, by coincidence, I was able to notice the number of toes on the corpse. `
`...Both feet had six toes. `
`...That's right, I think I heard it from Dad some time long ago. `
`Something about Grandfather having polydactyly, with extra toes. `
`According to old Ushiromiya family tradition, it seems that those with extra fingers or toes had some kind of good fortune and were treated as a good omen. `
`...And because of that, Grandfather was selected to be the Successor or something...... `
`But I wonder if I can be certain this is Grandfather's body just from the number of toes. `
`After all, Grandfather was supposed to be the leader of the group of culprits. `
`I didn't have a clue why he'd get stuffed into a boiler in a place like this and die. `
`A mysterious corpse, burning and spitting out a terrible stench amid the flames... `
`...If it really was Grandfather, `
`......did that mean that the leader of the group of culprits wasn't Grandfather, but that {f:5:Beatrice} after all...? `
`Grandfather was used because he was convenient...and was then thrown away? `
`......Unfortunately, it didn't look like I'd be given a chance to hear Grandfather's side of the story... `
`Now that I had obtained a tool, I thought about rushing to take on the cover to the well, `
`but I decided to break the shutter to the gardening shed first. `
`...I had plenty of time to kill anyway. `
`I figured I should check on the condition of Gohda-san's and Kumasawa-san's corpses. `
`I hit the shutter with the hatchet, breaking into it, `
`stuck the wire cutter into the crack, `
`and scissored it around, opening up a hole. `
`Then, I faced Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san's corpses once more... `
`As a result, I learned a new fact. `
`First, they had not died by being hung by the neck. `
`Both of their feet were solidly on the floor. `
`...And on both of their foreheads were signs that they'd been shot with a gun. `
`The loop seemed longer than a normal noose. `
`On top of that, the length was different on each to match the height of each person. `
`In other words, the lengths had been adjusted so that both Gohda-san, who was tall, and Kumasawa-san, who was short, `
`had their feet solidly but barely on the ground. `
`Also, while the ropes carried both of their weights as their heads lolled, both of them had some slack below their knees. `
`This meant that if they'd stood up with these loops around their necks, there would've been some extra length. `
`In other words, these loops wouldn't have been that great for hanging people. `
`The direct cause of death was probably a shot to the head. `
`It was gruesome. `
`Their insides were still dripping out from those gaping holes, staining their faces a deep red. `
`It's probably best to assume that they were then hung, pulled up, and left exposed like that. `
`...If they'd been shot with a gun, they would probably have been lying down on the floor. `
`...If that had been the case, you wouldn't have been able to tell they were dead even if you peeked through the window. `
`The mountain of stuff would've gotten in the way, so if they'd been lying down, they would've been hidden. `
`To make the deaths of these two known to the rest of us who couldn't go inside, `
`they would've had to hang them like this, making it visible from the outside. `
`...Was this...done to get back at us for thinking that those two would surely be safe if we left the key with them...? `
`I wonder where the shutter key we gave Gohda-san, which should've ensured their safety, is now... `
`That key...was in the pocket of his trousers. `
`The gardening shed key had been kindly left there, and even the plate was attached. `
`In other words, the gardening shed had been a closed room after all. `
`And that gave rise to another question. `
`...Because this can't be explained by a hanging. `
`If they didn't commit suicide, then those nooses were set up by the culprit. `
`...It might have been possible to shoot them through the window, but it's really unthinkable that someone could've tied two loops to the beam from the outside. `
`And furthermore, there's no way they could've lifted up the heavy corpses. `
`In other words, to do all of this, they would've had to go inside. `
`But the key was in Gohda-san's pocket, and the shutter had been locked. `
`In other words, the gardening shed had been a closed room. `
`Gohda-san had said that there was only one key to this shutter. `
`...But is it possible that there was a copy... `
`and that the culprit was in possession of it...? `
`If we're allowed to theorize that there actually was a duplicate of the gardening storehouse key...and that Gohda-san just didn't know about it, `
`then this isn't even close to a closed room. `
`......But why is it that, despite the fact that almost all of the other corpses were shot to death and left almost completely alone, `
`just these two corpses were intentionally hoisted up? `
`I couldn't help but feel something a bit odd about that... `
`After this, if we assume that the mystery corpse in the boiler was Grandfather's, `
`...the deaths of 16 people have been confirmed. `
`There were 18 people on this island. `
`I'm here, and there are 16 corpses. `
`Kanon-kun's corpse is the only one I haven't been able to confirm. `
`According to Kyrie-san, he had been killed while climbing out of the well...and had fallen down into it. `
`So with the well closed up like this, it's impossible to check. `
`I tried shining a flashlight through the bars, down into the darkness in the depths of the well. `
`But it seemed that the jet-black darkness had no intention of showing me its depths with a light of that level... `
`It looked like I'd have to break the bars after all. `
`Using the hatchets and things I'd dragged from the boiler room and the gardening shed, I tried breaking the cover of the well. `
`But the metal bars were extraordinarily sturdy, and breaking them wasn't easy. `
`...I hit them with the hatchet over and over, until my hands started feeling weird, and eventually gave up on breaking them... `
`...It's impossible. `
`If they were at least wood, I might've been able to break them. `
`But this metal... `
`That's right, there's no way you can slice through metal bars like butter with a human's strength. `
`...I can't even begin to understand...that story about how Kanon-kun cut through metal bars. `
`I heard that a light like a red laser beam grew out of his arm... `
`and that he sliced through the metal bars like he was cutting through butter. `
`Cutting through metal bars like butter...? `
`...And what's with the red laser beam? `
`Does that mean he secretly had a burner on him or something... `
`and used that to burn through the bars...? `
`Still, just what kind of laser......could cut through metal bars like butter? `
`...It almost sounds like the kind of laser beam you'd find in those robot anime I'd loved as a kid, doesn't it? `
`Does something like that actually exist...? `
`And how did Kanon-kun get that laser beam...? `
`No matter how much I want to ask him, he's already been killed. `
`Plus, even his corpse is now in the depths of the well, beyond this cover. `
`If Kanon-kun could slice through metal bars, I'm sure he could handle this metal cover in a single swing. `
`...It...feels just like the closed room Gohda-san was locked in while holding the key. `
`Only one person can open the door, but they're locked inside... `
`...If only I had that power of Kanon-kun's, I'd be able to do something about this cover myself... `
`............ `
`Just who is Kanon-kun? `
`He couldn't really be...a non-Human being capable of using a strange power, right? `
`Kyrie-san told me to believe in witches, and I even met an insane woman calling herself one. `
`...Could Kanon-kun possibly be... `
`a human on the witch's side...? `
`...Or else, `
`......the culprit? `
`......What the heck. `
`...Am I gonna start treating him like the culprit...just because I can't find his corpse? `
`Hoh, ...treating him like the culprit because there's no corpse...? `
`And who was the one babbling about the suspicious being innocent...? `
`......Very well, I couldn't bear having you push all the crimes on Kanon and building a human culprit theory that way. `
`I will guarantee it with the red... `
`{p:1:Kanon is dead}. `
`{p:1:Among the five in Kyrie's group, he was the first to die}. `
`{p:1:In short, he was the ninth victim}. `
`"...Since there's no corpse, ...I can't say for sure... `
`that Kanon-kun is dead." `
`So, my whispering in red does not reach the piece you... `
`{n}.........But it did reach {i:you}, right.........? `
`At a glance, this was a mass murder due to something strange that could only be thought of as magic. `
`...Golden threads that attacked through key holes. `
`No, we even have testimony that something gold flew around the dining hall when the first six died. `
`The two might've been the same weapon. `
`Then there was the closed room murder of the garden shed, and the laser beam that could cut metal bars. `
`...And that wasn't all. `
`There was much, much more...like the group of goat monsters, `
`the story of a witch who could create pitfalls just by snapping her fingers, the rabbit-like demons who had fired golden threads... `
`I think there was more, ......but each part was all screwed up. `
`I couldn't possibly accept it...and was forced to suspect that it was some kind of trick or mistake. `
`...But why in the world had everyone spoken with one voice, saying the same thing without contradictions in their testimony...? `
`It's not only the magic. `
`There's Maria's mysterious death. `
`Why Jessica knew that George-aniki had been killed. `
`The mysterious burnt corpse that I couldn't confirm really belonged to that damn geezer. `
`...And more, and more. `
`All stuff I don't get...! `
`I tilted the wine bottle up and gulped. `
`...I don't have a clue what's going on. `
`After dinner last night, the kids were chased out and told to go back to the guesthouse, `
`......and then there was a massacre in the dining hall. `
`Kyrie-san and the rest were dropped through pitfalls and captured. `
`Then, Jessica and George-aniki were called out to take a test or whatever and killed. `
`Even though Kyrie-san's group was able to escape the dungeon somehow, all of them got killed in the end. `
`And at the very, very end, even Maria was killed, leaving me all alone. `
`......In short, I did nothing except stay locked up in the guesthouse. `
`During that time, a huge incident occurred and ended. `
`What can I call it except incomprehensible? `
`I don't have a clue anymore! `
`"Now I'm nothing but a drunk. `
`You plan on leaving only me alive...? `
`Show yourself right away and come to kill me already. `
`It's too much of a pain, so I won't search for you. `
`You show me your true form yourself...! `
`I won't run or hide, so come at me with arrows or bullets or whatever...!" `
`I haven't gotten any sleep since yesterday, so I'm incredibly sleepy. `
`You wanna kill me, go ahead. `
`I decided to return to the guesthouse and boldly rest in a bed. `
`...When I exited the kitchen and passed through the lobby, `
`......that portrait of the witch came into view. `
`The big clock did too. `
`...It was almost exactly 24:00. `
`Then, the sound of the bell rang out, proclaiming that 24:00 had arrived... `
`As I listened, ...I looked up at {f:5:Beatrice}'s portrait. `
`Exactly 24 hours ago, I met you. `
`What were you trying to say...? `
`And where did you go? `
`Just who in the world are you......? `
`Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`I haven't solved a single one of the riddles surrounding you...! `
`Show yourself... `
`......And fight me...!! `
`Then, ...the witch showed herself. `
`Like a guest of honor finally appearing, she showed herself on the landing at the top of the big staircase... `
`"So, you finally show yourself... `
`...I've been kept bored for a whole day." `
`"......Correct. `
`I gave you a whole day. `
`Was that enough for you to fully exercise the rights of the Human side?" `
`"Yeah. `
`I was bored, after all. `
`I did a heck of a lot of it." `
`"......Ange...was a good piece." `
`"Don't you......speak Ange's name." `
`"......She appeared through a miracle, sacrificed herself, and gave you the tenacity required for certain victory." `
`"Don't you...speak Ange's name." `
`"......That brutal death was something you needed. `
`If you hadn't seen that death, you wouldn't have grown serious. `
`Without the wake-up call of Ange's ill-fated future, your tenacity for victory would not have been born." `
`"I told you not to speak Ange's name...!!" `
`"......In short, she was a necessary sacrifice. `
`Otherwise, an anger great enough to kill me would not have been born in you. `
`The rivalry between us cannot be destroyed." `
`"Damn you, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, it's more fitting to call that a trump card than a piece. `
`...No matter how much a piece acts, it does not stray from the board. `
`But no matter how much power a trump card wields, it is always thrown away after it is used." `
`"Ange was truly a good trump card for you." `
`"Don't you...speak Ange's naaaaaaaaaaaammme!!!" `
`At Battler's angry roar, Beato finally stopped talking. `
`"...You know, I don't have time to play around in a place like this anymore. `
`...Even a tie will keep Ange waiting. `
`"............I am going to break through you, `
`...take my family, `
`...and go back home!! `
`I won't waste a second playing witch games with you!!" `
`"In that case, what should you do? `
`You know, don't you?" `
`"Yeah! `
`I'll beat you down!! `
`I'll blast away all witches, magic, illusions and delusions!! `
`Come on, let's get started!!! `
`I won't let you trick me again!! `
`Resume the game, okay? `
`I'll tear apart the witch's veil concealing the outright lie you are!!!" `
`"You talk too much. `
`All you have to do is honestly say "I'll kill you"." `
`"Yeah. `
`If those are the words you want, ...I'll say them. `
`This is the first and last wish of yours that I'll lend an ear to." `
`"......I thank you." `
`"I will.................." `
`"..........................." `
`“I will kill you......!!!” `
`"Very well!! `
`Let us begin, Battler...!! `
`Yes, the time for the witch hunt has come...!! `
`Try and chase me, try and corner me, try and kill me! I expect a lot from you!! `
`Try and show me what your little sister gave you in her last moments...!!" `
`"Bring it oooooooooooooooooooooonnn!!!" `
`...Battler's cry burned the world with a white light. `
`And, if you opened your eyes amidst the darkness, ...the two of them could be seen in a rose garden... `
`"......Who shall make the first move?" `
`"Me." `
`"How bold." `
`In the rose garden, beautiful rose petals danced. `
`The color of those rose petals...was red. `
`Did the fact that they faced each other in this beautiful rose garden... `
`prove...or make claim to a red, single truth? `
`......That must be why the roses are red. `
`But in the language of flowers, ...roses represent passion. `
`...Not truth. `
`The flower for truth is a forget-me-not. `
`And that flower...is blue. `
`"I'll bore through everything with my blue truth. `
`......From the very beginning of everything. `
`I'll start from the very first game!" `
`"Very well. `
`Let's see what you've got. `
`...Come." `
`"Here I go...... `
`I've already proclaimed it, but I'll say it again. `
`...This isn't just for the murder of Doctor Nanjo in the last game. `
`This'll tear apart every scene from every game since the beginning...!!" `
`"{p:2:Ushiromiya Kinzo is already dead}! `
`{p:2:Therefore, the true number of people on the island is 17}! `
`{p:2:By adding an unknown person X to that, it becomes 18 people}. `
`{p:2:By supposing that this person X exists, the crime is possible even if all 17 people have alibis}." `
`"{p:2:By this, even though the number of people reaches 18, it is still possible for culprit X to exist and carry out the crime even if all 18 people seem to have alibis}!!" `
`You can break through all of the murders in Episode 1 by supposing an unknown person X. `
`Furthermore, it's even possible to explain the mystery of Kinzo's evaporation from the closed room sealed by the receipt... `
`by making the bold assumption that Kinzo wasn't there in the first place. `
`Unless Beato counters this with the red truth, `
`the Illusion of the Witch from Episode 1 has been completely smashed. `
`......This blue truth is valid. `
`The wedge of blue truth that Battler had thrown stabbed right through the top of Beato's left foot. `
`...Was the red blood pouring out from there...a protest being made by her red truth...? `
`Beato shut one of her eyes tight, enduring the unbearable pain of the blue truth that denied her. `
`"Hmm, not bad. `
`...But I mustn't be denied yet, I mustn't be killed yet. `
`...This is not yet enough. `
`......In the subsequent games, there were mysteries that couldn't be explained with that alone, right?" `
`"...Which mysteries?" `
`"In the final stages of the second game, `
`George took Gohda and Shannon with him, barricaded them in Natsuhi's room, and was killed. `
`The key that unlocked Natsuhi's room was locked up inside the room, and all of the remaining keys that could unlock that door were in Rosa's hand. `
`Even if a culprit X existed, it should have been impossible to construct that closed room." `
`The blue wedge that pierced Beato shook. `
`She was resisting, fighting to pull it out. `
`"No, that doesn't shake my blue truth. `
`If culprit X were to obtain a master key, that's not even close to a closed room." `
`"No, it was impossible for the culprit to obtain one. `
`{p:1:All of the master keys were under Rosa's control}!" `
`"But that's meaningless if Aunt Rosa was an accomplice to the culprit! `
`{p:2:Aunt Rosa handed a key over to culprit X by some method, assisting in the locked‐room murder}! `
`{p:2:And after that, she retrieved the key by a similar method}!" `
`Too naive, Beato!! `
`I'd already guessed that much at the time!" `
`"...*cackle* Yes, you did, didn't you... `
`...Gwaaargh...!!! `
`......Agh, ...ack-" `
`The wedge that had been gradually losing its sparkle and had seemed as though it was about to be pulled out... `
`regained its strong blue again thanks to Battler's additional blue truth...and dug into Beato again, eating into her foot. `
`Beato let out a cry of anguish at that pain. `
`".........guh, ......ohh...... `
`.........Not yet... `
`This is still nothing...... `
`Not yet, `
`......not yeeeeeeeet!!" `
`"On to the third game. `
`The six linked closed rooms, the murders of Aunt Rosa and Maria, Dad and the rest's deaths in the hall, the murders of Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi... `
`all of that `
`{p:2:can be explained if we suppose that Aunt Eva was the culprit}." `
`"This argument was already won back then. `
`And even that final riddle you proposed through {f:5:Eva}, `
`{p:2:the murder of Doctor Nanjo, can be explained with an 18th unknown person X}. `
`That breaks through the whole third game!!! Can you counter that?!" `
`"Guh, aah...!! `
`...O-Of course...! `
`This much is...nothing to worry about...! `
`In that case, how do you explain George's disappearance from the guesthouse? `
`I shall add to the red truth. `
`{p:1:George did not go down the stairs of the guesthouse}. `
`He flew out through the window!" `
`In the final stages of the third game, George suddenly vanished from the second floor of the guesthouse. `
`Eva, who had been on the first floor, claimed that no one had come downstairs, `
`but because of the blue truth, George could've snuck down to the first floor and escaped while Eva was busy carrying Krauss's and Natsuhi's corpses outside. `
`But by adding an additional red truth, Beato had denied that possibility. `
`To go outside without going down the staircase to the first floor, he would've had to leave by the window. `
`But all of the windows had been locked from the inside...! `
`"So what? `
`It's just like you said. `
`He flew out the window, right? `
`There was a lawn, so we couldn't tell if he'd jumped down, and it was raining so hard. `
`Any light traces would've disappeared." `
`"I'll use the red truth again. `
`{p:1:All windows and doors leading to the outside were locked from the inside}. `
`{p:1:Furthermore, it is impossible to lock any of those from the outside}! `
`George had no technique by which to lock them...!" `
`"I'll use more of the blue. `
`I said it myself at the time. `
`{p:2:In that case, everything works out as long as someone locked the window after George‐aniki escaped through it}! `
`Nothing difficult about that!!" `
`"Gwaaaaaaaahhaaaaah...!! `
`Gguuuuhhh... Can I not...escape after something like this...?" `
`Beato couldn't remove the blue wedge that was buried into her foot. `
`The fake witch was burned more and more by that forceful blue... `
`"There's still nothing that shakes my blue truth in any of the first three games. `
`...In that case, the only game that can prove you're a witch...is this game, the fourth game." `
`"...Since I haven't countered you with the red, that is so. `
`I shall have to prove witches using only this game. `
`......Very well. `
`Give me everything you've got." `
`"There's nothing strange about the murder of the six people in the dining hall. `
`{p:2:The 18th person X went wild with a gun and killed everyone}. `
`{p:2:Regarding the pitfalls, there is every chance that pitfalls truly were hidden there, `
`and it's also possible to explain them with Kyrie‐san's theory hypothesizing the existence of a poison‐dart‐shooting device X which can knock a person out instantly}." `
`"{p:2:The murders of George‐aniki, Jessica, and those who escaped from the dungeon can also be explained with guns, just like the dining hall}. `
`There's nothing strange about it!" `
`"But I'm sure you've got a counterattack, right? `
`Bring it on!!" `
`"Your greatest sword, this 18th person X, is based on the theory that Kinzo was already dead. `
`I knew you would make that claim. `
`That's why I took Kinzo out of his study. `
`All members in the family conference welcomed that Kinzo, right? `
`{p:1:All of those present at the family conference acknowledged the existence of Kinzo}!" `
`"That's right. `
`But Grandfather was seriously ill, bedridden on the verge of life and death, right? `
`If he was so worn out that he looked like a different person, maybe no one would've cared, right?" `
`"I'll counter with this. `
`{p:2:That Grandfather was a different person, a body double}. `
`{p:2:A different person who the relatives mistook for Grandfather}!" `
`"Then I'll counter with this. `
`{p:1:No person would mistake Ushiromiya Kinzo by sight}. `
`{p:1:No matter what the disguise, they would not mistake Ushiromiya Kinzo by sight}!" `
`"Then how about this. `
`{p:2:By declaring with the red truth in the second game that the number of master keys was five, when in the first game the number was more than five, `
`you changed the premises of the later games}." `
`"{p:2:In the same way, there is a possibility that Kinzo's life or death status was changed for the fourth game}." `
`"{p:2:Therefore, Kinzo's existence in the fourth game does not serve as proof that he existed in the previous games}...! `
`{p:2:Therefore, even if we suppose that the six murders in the dining hall were carried out by Grandfather himself, it doesn't create any contradictions}!" `
`"Then let me counter this way. `
`{p:1:Kinzo's life or death status is the same at the start of each of the four games}. `
`{p:1:The setup was not different for the fourth game alone}...!" `
`"Repeat it. `
`"Kinzo was alive at the start time of every game"!" `
`"I refuse to repeat it. `
`I won't answer, Battler. `
`I won't give you the red truth you so desire...!" `
`"...Damn, ...you're standing in my way, geezer...!! `
`Are you putting yourself on the line to protect {f:5:Beatrice}, this most beloved witch of yours?!" `
`Swaying, that damn geezer came into view. `
`...Heh, is he trying to be some kind of knight, blocking the path between me and Beato...?! `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle* Battler, `
`are you capable of surpassing me...?" `
`"I won't let you reach, I will not let you reach, ...not to the Golden Witch's height, you seeeeeeeeee?! `
`Fuhhahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`Your thoughtless reasoning cannot surpass even me alone! `
`Die!!!" `
`Kinzo's jet-black cape spread as though it would swallow the world, `
`becoming the snout of a vast black dragon that came at me, trying to swallow me in one gulp. `
`...Faced with that black dragon's roar, I calmed my breathing and closed my eyes lightly... `
`"I'll swallow you up in a single gulp!! `
`Disappear, inexperienced fooooooooooool!!!" `
`"......Quiet, you damn undying ghost." `
`"Hoh, so you call me a ghost? `
`So, you intend to see it through to the end, this theory that I am already dead!! `
`That will prove fatal to you!! `
`Be swallowed up by the first twilight of the fourth game and disappear!!" `
`The black dragon's vast mouth, its snout, its fangs...swallowed Battler whole...!!! `
`In that instant, Battler suddenly opened his eyes! `
`"Thanks, {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`Your third game became a foothold for my counterattack." `
`"What...?" `
`"See ya, damn geezer. `
`This is goodbye. `
`......As a basis for claiming that "Kinzo was dead" even in the 4th game, I propose the following theory!" `
`"Very well, come with all you have, my descendant!! `
`"Here I go, you damn geezer!! `
`{p:2:My theory is that Kinzo's name is passed on as the title of the Ushiromiya family head}!" `
`"{p:2:Ushiromiya Kinzo was already dead}. `
`{p:2:And he passed {i:his name} on to someone else}! `
`{p:2:Everyone acknowledged it}!! `
`{p:2:And, therefore, ‘all of those present at the family conference acknowledged the existence of Kinzo’}!!" `
`"{p:2:There wasn't even any need for this person to disguise themselves as Grandfather}. `
`{p:2:Because everyone recognized a new ‘Kinzo’}! `
`{p:2:Therefore, they didn't actually ‘mistake Kinzo by sight’}!! `
`{p:2:As long as the preceding theory is not disproven, nothing can change the fact that you're dead}!!!" `
`"This is the final blow. `
`Damn geezer, I demand that you repeat it. `
`"Among all of the people there, not one had multiple, different names"!!" `
`"I...can...not......!! `
`Gah, gwoooooooooooooooooooragghgghghh!!" `
`"Rest in peace, damn geezer. `
`Thank me. You were finally able to die. `
`This is your requiem, take it and drop dead!!" `
`"{p:2:Ushiromiya Kinzo was already dead}! `
`{p:2:Yeah, poor old you—whenever we find your corpse, it's always completely burnt}. `
`{p:2:That was a gimmick to prevent discovery of the fact that time had passed since your death}!!" `
`"{p:2:And you passed your name onto someone else}!! `
`{p:2:With this theory, even though {i:you} are dead, {i:"Kinzo"} can still appear at the family conference}!!!" `
`"{p:2:How's that? This is checkmaaaaaaaaaaaate}!!" `
`Several dozen blue stakes bored into Kinzo's ghost. `
`Their terrible destructive power wouldn't let the ghost recover again...!! `
`"...{f:5:Be...atr...ice}......" `
`"......Kinzo, `
`...thank you for everything. `
`...Rest...in peace... `
`I will not forget...my time spent with you......" `
`Dispersing along with the shadow of the black dragon as golden flower petals scattered, `
`...Ushiromiya Kinzo became a gold-colored cyclone and disappeared... `
`Even after death, he had fought for the sake of the woman he'd loved. `
`...There's no doubting that your love and madness were the real thing...! `
`"......Nggg, ......Battler......" `
`"Don't hate me. `
`...Let the dead sleep. `
`Don't wake them. `
`...You're up next. `
`This is the end for you too." `
`Beato still couldn't pull out the blue wedge that pierced her foot... `
`She realized that she was on the verge of death... `
`"I've gone along with you a whole bunch. `
`I think I've more than fulfilled any responsibility I had to play with you. `
`...But it's about time to finish things up. `
`I've got a lonely little sister waiting at home." `
`"...Let me take my leave with my whole family...!!" `
`"...Then kill me. `
`...In that case, try and kill me! `
`...I won't run or hide, and by now I won't even be able to avoid it!! `
`Come ooooooooooooooooooooooon, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!!!" `
`"You've got it!! `
`With the 18th person X from the dead‐Kinzo theory, everything remaining is pierced through!" `
`"{p:2:George‐aniki and Jessica's deaths in the fourth game can also be explained by culprit X}!! `
`{p:2:And the five who escaped from the dungeon and were killed, and the two in the gardening shed, and Maria in the end}! `
`{p:2:All of those can be explained with an 18th person X}!! `
`{p:2:There's nothing strange at all}!!" `
`"This concludes the explanation of the culprit, with humans, for all games!! `
`{f:5:Beatrice}, ......this here is...checkmaaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aate!!" `
`"Uu, ...whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh......aah...!" `
`{f:5:Beatrice}, who couldn't dodge, had several blue stakes driven into her and was skewered... `
`Beato grabbed at them, trying to pull them out somehow... `
`.........Aaaaaaahhhh, `
`...that got meee... `
`......It huurts...... `
`...This'll......kill me, won't it......? `
`...If I don't pull these out, `
`......I'll die... `
`I've had enough of the pain... `
`...I've had enough of...... `
`...the...anguish... `
`With both hands, ...Beato firmly grasped one of the blue stakes. `
`...Naturally, the power of the witch-denying blue truth burned her hands. `
`...Unable even to hide her tears at the pain, Beato howled and tried to pull the stakes out with all her might... `
`If I can't pull these out, ......I'll die...... `
`...This is......my final counterattack...... `
`"Then Battler, `
`...how do you explain my several acts of magic...? `
`......The very first time those appeared...was in the second game, when I fixed Maria's pumpkin marshmallow. `
`At that time, Rosa definitely witnessed that magic." `
`Certainly, at that time, Rosa witnessed gold butterflies gathering and the fixing of a marshmallow by the miracle of magic. `
`"...*cackle*cackle*... `
`...Rosa alone witnessing it isn't very credible, right...? `
`That's why I increased the number of witnesses to the uppermost limit later on. `
`...Which is what...happened in this last game..." `
`"The summoning of my minions! `
`And brutal murders due to magic! `
`All of those were witnessed by a great many people...!! `
`That is itself...proof that my magic exists...!! `
`How do you explain that, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerr......?!!!" `
`"......Stalemate." `
`"......Wh-Whaat...?" `
`""Magic exists because magic exists". `
`Didn't the rules of our Braun tube trial say that you couldn't use that kind of argument?" `
`"......Y...es, ...you're right...... `
`...Heh, ......hahack, ...guh..." `
`"No matter who `
`or how many people `
`witnessed magic, `
`that cannot become proof of magic's existence!!" `
`"Whether all the magic you've shown exists or not, I can ignore it all and explain things with Humans. `
`That's my undeniable right. `
`...Am I wrong?" `
`At those words, the blue stakes let out an even brighter light, knocking my hands away. `
`......As I feared, `
`...pull them out after all...... `
`...ggghh...... `
`As Battler is now, even if I pull up a witness for each individual bit of magic and demand an explanation, he'll probably use some kind of move to deny all of them. `
`...Not just the magic with the marshmallow I showed Rosa, ...but all the miracles of magic. `
`So, I can no longer even claim to be a witch without questioning him about something like how a marshmallow was fixed... `
`I'm in such an inferior position that I must fight over such trivialities... `
`It may be......impossible for me...... `
`...I know that... `
`This was to be a game without victory from the very beginning. `
`...So, it was only natural that the day of my defeat would eventually come. `
`Have I fought Battler... `
`up until today... `
`...just to lose to Battler......? `
`......I began the game...thinking I might be able to win. `
`Even if I wouldn't be able to win easily, I believed that in a game repeating endlessly, a miracle would eventually occur. `
`...After all, I had certain willpower on my side, an unwavering desire to win with certainty. `
`...However, I've now lost that miracle completely. `
`And, that certain willpower resides in Battler, ...leaving me certainly without even a one-in-a-million chance at a miracle. `
`No, perhaps I should say with no {i:miracles or certainty}...... `
`I will have no victory...and no end through a tie. `
`......The only resolution permitted is... `
`is to continue on resisting... `
`...until defeat is given to me...in this game... `
`That's right, I... `
`...am fighting......only to be killed by Battler...... `
`...I looked into Battler's eyes. `
`That which was reflected inside them...wasn't me. `
`......The figures of the little sister waiting for his return...and the family he had to bring back were reflected in those eyes. `
`To him, my existence is already...not even that of an individual. `
`...Obviously. `
`From the very beginning, he has been trying to deny the individual that I am. `
`......Yes, ...that last game... `
`sure was fun... `
`I was only tricking him a bit, `
`...but for just a short period of time, it felt like we understood each other, ...and that was fun... `
`...That's right, `
`...I should've made my move then... `
`I should have continued for eternity with Battler still totally fooled... `
`............But... `
`...that's just no good, right...? `
`......That... `
`just wouldn't be true victory...... `
`"......Is this...checkmate? `
`{f:5:Beatrice}?" `
`Beato had been run through with several blue stakes, skewered over and over to the ground while still standing. `
`Because of that, she wasn't even able to fall over, `
`......and, still looking up into the sky, ...was sewn in place... `
`That tragic form... `
`might have been a fitting end for the cruel witch who had endlessly toyed with 18 people's lives and who had killed constantly for hundreds and thousands of years. `
`Gently, ...as though someone was mourning over something, ...rain began to fall. `
`...Amid that rain, Beato was soaked...and crucified... `
`"...Is it over, Beato?" `
`"...............There was... `
`...not even a squeak......" `
`"Not yet. `
`You aren't a woman who'll let things end with just this." `
`"........................ `
`..........Don't be... `
`...ridiculous... `
`......How can you look at this... `
`and think that it isn't... `
`...over...? `
`...Quickly, deliver the final blow......" `
`"............" `
`"...Just say it. `
`...With your...blue truth. `
`............‘Therefore, `
`...witches do not exist'. `
`...Say it... `
`......Just say it...... `
`...With that single blow, `
`...just put a stop... `
`...to my breathing......" `
`"It's useless." `
`"......Hoh... `
`......So you would expose me...to even further shame...? `
`Isn't it settled already...?" `
`"Stand up. `
`Our brawl still isn't over." `
`"......Not over, ...you say......?" `
`"That just now wasn't you losing. `
`You just stopped and gave up." `
`"...Isn't that...enough...? `
`...Wouldn't giving up... `
`mean your victory? `
`.........You should... `
`...return to your little sister... `
`right away... `
`Just throw me away... `
`right here......" `
`"Didn't I tell you? `
`I won't run away. `
`And... `
`I won't let you run away." `
`"............" `
`"Just who are you? `
`And what in the world is it that you want?" `
`If you want to know, ...why don't you just try your favorite move...? `
`"...............What does it matter... `
`...Just... `
`...a delusion, `
`an illusion... `
`Isn't that... `
`enough...?" `
`"It's all useless. `
`I won't... `
`let you run away." `
`"............" `
`"I'll break through you. `
`How could I let you run away like this?" `
`"............" `
`"I won't let you run back to the darkness of illusions while you're still all hazy like this. `
`......I'll break through you. `
`Completely. `
`So stand up. `
`Don't act all frail like that! `
`You're still hiding several moves! `
`I can tell!" `
`".........Why...won't you just let me escape...?" `
`"Dad, Mom, and Ange. `
`All the cousins and all the relatives. `
`And all the servants. `
`You toyed with them so much and killed them...!! `
`I definitely won't forget, won't forgive that inhumanity!" `
`"I can still feel...Ange's arms on my shoulders...!! `
`I won't forgive your inhumanity...!! `
`So I won't let you get away like this...!!!" `
`Battler's eyes burned with the flames of hatred... `
`...The time had long since passed during which pitiful behavior would have earned his compassion. `
`...After being tricked once, Battler will never sympathize with me again. `
`Never mind the wolves and sheep puzzle, `
`......this is like the boy who cried wolf, isn't it......? `
`......What am I supposed to do......? `
`......What should I do......? `
`...Is fighting endlessly only to avoid admitting defeat...a fitting endless torture for the Endless Witch? `
`......Is endlessly harassing Battler, to avoid giving him victory, ...also part of being the Endless Witch......? `
`...............It's so sad...... `
`......Is this... `
`...what the Endless Magic is......? `
`I've... `
`......had enough......... `
`...of endlessly `
`being toyed with by witches...... `
`I've... `
`...had enough... `
`I will have no victory...and no tie. `
`...In that case, there's only one result that can release me. `
`...Hmph, ...hahahahahahaha... `
`Since the time I succumbed to the path of witches. `
`Since the day I made that contract with demons. `
`......It was promised that I would meet my end through tragedy, was it not......? `
`"What's wrong?!! `
`Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!! `
`If you are the ruler of Rokkenjima, show me a majesty fitting for that, even at the very eeeeeeeeeeeeennddd!!!" `
`Lightning. `
`...The world was smashed with white. `
`......Fitting last moments...for the ruler of Rokkenjima. `
`Haha, ......hahhahahahahahahahaha...... `
`"Hahhahahahahaha, ...wahhahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!!" `
`"............" `
`Still pierced by the blue stakes, ...Beato faced the rainy sky and let out a cry of laughter. `
`Then, she slowly raised her face...and stared at Battler. `
`"......Fool. `
`...Just when I was about to praise your good fight and hand over victory... `
`......You shall regret that pride..." `
`"This isn't something for you to hand over. `
`I'm gonna take it from you!! `
`The same goes for you, right?!! `
`You could never accept an easygoing victory where I just say "Maybe witches existing isn't so bad"... Isn't that the very reason you intentionally fell apart like that at the end last time...?!!! `
`That's right, last game, you took pity on me just once, didn't you?!!" `
`"So now I'll pay back that debt! Stand!!! `
`My enemy, my Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!!" `
`"Hahhahaha... `
`Fool. `
`......You foooooooooooool, hhahhahahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`You simpleton...!! `
`You think you'll get another chance?! `
`Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!" `
`When Beato yelled, the blue stakes that had pierced her chest blew to bits and disappeared. `
`...However, the blue wedge that had pierced her foot in the very beginning did not vanish. `
`"You can't pull it out yet. `
`You can't pull out the blue truth of the 18th person X...!!" `
`"I will respond to one thing you told me to repeat. `
`As you reasoned, `
`{p:1:Kinzo is already dead at the starting time for all games}!" `
`"However, in that case, all I need to do is take one person out!! `
`{p:1:Thus far, I have been declaring that no more than 18 humans exist on this island}. `
`{p:1:I will lower that by one for Kinzo}!!" `
`"{p:1:No more than 17 humans exist on this island}!! `
`{p:1:That excludes any 18th person}. `
`{p:1:In short, this 18th person X does not exist}!! `
`{p:1:This applies to all games}!!!" `
`"What do you know? `
`Looks like you're still hiding some pretty crazy stuff up your sleeve after all... `
`The island, which had no more than 17 humans on it, has been set up to appear as though there were 18. `
`Taking one off makes it 17, so we've finally reached the correct number. `
`......This way, the wedge I knocked into you has been removed. `
`We'll have to start the fight over, back from square one...!" `
`The blue wedge that had sewn Beato in place broke apart. `
`......There was no longer anything piercing her. `
`The scars on her body had disappeared completely. `
`There stood, ...just as Battler had hoped for, ...the figure of the majestic Golden Witch who ruled Rokkenjima. `
`"...Then come, Battler. `
`Once more from the beginning. `
`Try and break through everything with the blue truth. `
`I too will no longer play, run, or hide." `
`"If you are worthless, then I shall end this match right here, right now. `
`With my grand victory, I'll make you regret your refusal to compromise for all eternity!!! `
`Come, starting from the first game!" `
`"Right!! `
`From the first twilight of the first game!! `
`{p:2:There is nothing strange about the murder of the six relatives that were found in the gardening shed in the beginning}! `
`{p:2:The crime was possible for any of those who didn't have an alibi}!!" `
`"Valid. `
`Continue, what about the next closed room murder, with Eva and Hideyoshi?! `
`Even the chain was set for that closed room! `
`I shall add to the red truth. `
`"{p:1:Both deaths were homicides}! `
`{p:1:It is not the case that, after the construction of the locked room, one of them committed suicide after murdering the other}! `
`{p:1:Furthermore, the murder was carried out with both the victim and the perpetrator in the same room}! `
`{p:1:No method exists for the perpetrator to commit murder from outside the room}!" `
`"{p:2:Suppose that the culprit was a human without an alibi}. `
`{p:2:In other words, the dead}! `
`{p:2:Among the first six corpses, there were some made unidentifiable because their faces were smashed}." `
`"{p:2:One possible theory is that one was actually a fake corpse, and that some culprit X killed those two after pretending to be a victim and hiding away}! `
`{p:2:Then, after the locked‐room murder was constructed, the culprit hid under the bed, and waited for all of us to leave}!!" `
`"Very well, next! `
`Kanon was killed in the boiler room, correct? `
`I shall add to the red truth. `
`{p:1:All of the survivors have alibis}! `
`{p:1:Let us include the dead as well}!! `
`{p:1:In short, no kind of human or dead person on the island could have killed Kanon}!" `
`"{p:2:If no one could kill him, then he might have been the one to kill}!! `
`{p:2:Meaning Kanon‐kun might have killed himself}." `
`"Repeat it! `
`"Kanon‐kun did not commit suicide"!" `
`"{p:1:Kanon did not commit suicide}." `
`"One more. `
`Repeat it, "Kanon-kun's death was a homicide"." `
`"I refuse to repeat it." `
`"By that refusal, it may be possible to view it as a homicide, but you've already proclaimed in red that no one could've killed him. `
`In other words, it wasn't a homicide. `
`This is the same as the linked closed rooms from the third game." `
`"{p:2:Kanon‐kun died for a reason that was neither suicide nor homicide}. `
`{p:2:Though the circumstances are unclear, he died from an accident}." `
`"{p:2:By the Devil's Proof, I refuse to explain what kind of blunder could have led to an accidental death where a stake was driven into his chest}!!" `
`"Hohoh, now that you have borrowed the power of demons, you are without peer! `
`It is valid!" `
`"In that case, what about the murders after that in the parlor, of Genji, Nanjo, and Kumasawa?! `
`Naturally, `
`{p:1:Maria, who was in the same room, did not kill them}! `
`{p:1:And of course, their three deaths were homicides}!" `
`"{p:2:We can explain it with the one who carried out the murder being a culprit X who used an unidentifiable corpse to disappear}. `
`{p:2:In the first place, their three faces were also pulverized}. `
`{p:2:It's completely possible that one of them was a body‐double corpse}!" `
`"{p:1:I guarantee the identities of all unidentified corpses}. `
`{p:1:Therefore, there were no body‐double tricks}!" `
`"{p:2:Then I can explain it with simultaneous murders}. `
`{p:2:Each of the three had a gun, pointed it at another in a clockwise pattern, and they blew each others' faces off at the same time}! `
`{p:2:After that, Maria collected those guns and hid them}!! `
`How about that?!!!" `
`"What?! ...What a ridiculous argument!!! `
`H-How amusing...!! `
`Then what about Natsuhi in the end?!" `
`"I shall add to the red truth! `
`{p:1:Natsuhi's death was a homicide}! `
`{p:1:There are no corpses of unknown identity, and all of the survivors have alibis}!" `
`"{p:2:You can explain it with an indirect murder by trap X}! `
`{p:2:Something was done to Aunt Natsuhi's gun}. `
`{p:2:You can explain it if that was a trap gun, built to send a bullet right into the forehead of anyone who tried to hold it up and shoot it}!!" `
`"{p:1:The bullet buried into Natsuhi's forehead was not fired from Natsuhi's gun}!" `
`"{p:2:There is the possibility that Aunt Natsuhi was lured out by that letter of unknown contents}! `
`{p:2:And she was called out into the hall}. `
`{p:2:Then, she was forced into standing at a specified location at a specified time, and murdered by some trap X, which used a gun that had been installed there beforehand}!!" `
`"Wonderful!! `
`These reckless arguments of yours are even starting to feel pleasurable now! `
`Out of respect, I shall hand the first game over to you...!! `
`Well done!! `
`......Gaaaah!!!" `
`The instant Beato acknowledged her defeat in the first game, `
`the stakes of the blue truth once again pierced her chest, letting out a terrible sound... `
`"...Ku, ...gwah, ......gaaaaaahhh!!! `
`This is still...hardly painful, ...and it's not over yet!! `
`Come, now for the second game!!" `
`Beato just barely pulled out the stakes that had pierced her chest, `
`...but even though there was no hole left behind, she still seemed to be bearing a deep wound that was letting out a massive amount of blood. `
`And, she was tormented by an equally fierce pain... `
`But Beato grinned, grinding her teeth, and pushed for the next game to start. `
`But I won't feel sympathy for her. `
`...Just by her existing there, we've been killed and harassed over and over, `
`......and Ange's been burdened with a future of isolation...!! `
`"Correct, just by my being here and laughing, this eternal hell will continue...!! `
`I won't give your little sister back...! `
`Let her cry over the family that shall not return for the next thousand years...!!" `
`"Damn iiiiiiiiiittt!! `
`No compassion, no mercy! On to the second game!! `
`I'll start with the first crime! `
`Right after it happened, I penetrated to the truth of the closed room murder where the six were killed in the chapel. `
`{p:2:Someone secretly borrowed Maria's key, and secretly returned it to Maria's bag after the crime was over}!!" `
`"{p:1:From the time Maria received her key to the instant Rosa unsealed the envelope the next day, the key did not pass into anyone's hands}!!" `
`"{p:2:There is the possibility that the door to the chapel had an auto‐lock just like Gramps's study}. `
`{p:2:In other words, it was unlocked before the crime, with a rock or something wedged in so that it couldn't close completely}. `
`{p:2:Then they gave the key to Maria}. `
`{p:2:Because the lock was automatic, it is possible to make a theory where the key wasn't needed}!" `
`"{p:1:No door with an auto‐lock exists other than Kinzo's study}!" `
`"{p:2:The victims locked the door from the inside}. `
`{p:2:One of the six was the culprit, and this person killed the other five, then pretended to be dead}!!" `
`"{p:1:The six were all already dead by the time they were discovered}! `
`{p:1:All of their deaths were homicides}! `
`{p:1:All six were pure victims; they did not take part in a mutual murder}! `
`{p:1:There were no simultaneous mutual murders}!!" `
`"{p:2:There existed humans with no alibi at the time, e.g. Kumasawa‐san}. `
`{p:2:If we assume that such a person killed the six, and was hiding inside, then there are no problems}!" `
`"{p:1:There was no one hiding in that chapel}. `
`{p:1:Therefore, your ‘killer hiding in the building’ locked‐room scenario does not hold}!" `
`What's wrong, is that all, Ushiromiya Battleer?! `
`It's not so easy once you get to the second game, riiiight?!" `
`It was a thundering exchange of red and blue truth. `
`The stakes and wedges of blue truth that I sent flying attacked one after the other, and Beato cut them down one after another with her red truth, her red treasured sword, knocking them down. `
`But the blood she'd lost from the first game was probably serious. `
`This intense exercise was putting an even greater strain on her. `
`I could also see her breath grow ragged. `
`That's why I can't hold back now! `
`...I'll corner that witch! `
`This time I'll break through her! `
`"Not yet, aah, it's useless, it's all useless!! `
`My twisted logic isn't finished yet!! `
`Then what about this?!!" `
`"{p:2:The food they were given had small bombs in it, which exploded from inside their stomachs}. `
`{p:2:In other words, the crime is possible through trap X}! `
`{p:2:The details of a bomb that they could swallow without noticing and that could blow open their stomachs is a Devil's Proof}! `
`{p:2:I refuse to explain}!!" `
`"Pfft, hhahahahahahahhahahahhaha!! `
`What the hell's thaaaaaaaaat?! `
`Small bommmmmmmbs?! `
`Waahhahahahahhahhahha!!" `
`But Beato failed to knock down the blue wedge as it flew at an angle like a breaking pitch. `
`It let out a loud *thunk*...and gouged itself deep into her left shoulder. `
`However, even as the breaking pitch hit her, her laughter didn't seem to be stopping. `
`...Yeah, I get it, even I think that theory's pretty screwed up...!! `
`"Hah, laugh as much as you want!! `
`Got a problem with that?!!" `
`"None!! `
`Quite a pleasurable, reckless argument!!! `
`Next up is the closed room with Jessica and Kanon!" `
`"No problems there! `
`{p:2:If the culprit was one of the servants, they could have used a master key}. `
`{p:2:It's not even a locked room}!" `
`"After that, there was an attack in the servant room from a mystery person who seemed to be Kanon, and Nanjo and Kumasawa were killed, right?! `
`I had already proclaimed Kanon's death in red before that time. `
`So, who was that Kanon?!" `
`"{p:2:If Kanon‐kun's death was declared with the red, there's no way he was alive}. `
`{p:2:Therefore, there is a chance that it was someone else in a disguise that would make the group that was attacked mistake this person for Kanon‐kun}!" `
`"{p:1:They would never mistakenly think any other person was Kanon}!" `
`"{p:2:Then, just like the heredity of Kinzo's name, there is a possibility that Kanon's name was inherited by someone}. `
`{p:2:You could suppose that Kanon‐kun was killed, a different person succeeded his name, and this person attacked them}!!" `
`A sound like a watermelon being squashed rang out, and a blue wedge was buried deep into Beato's left flank... `
`Maybe it hit in a bad place, since it seemed to be really effective. `
`After leaning over and moaning for a while, `
`...she laughed it off as though trying to make it seem like no big deal. `
`Yeah, I get it. `
`That must've hurt a lot...!! `
`"Hyahhaaaaaaaahhh!! `
`Once again, you've set up some Human as the culprit as if it were nothing!! `
`You truly are gabbing on about things you'd never be able to open your mouth and say on the game board!!" `
`"And yet it's valid! `
`That reckless argument is pleasurable!! `
`...Truly pleasurable. `
`......This isn't pain, ...it's pleeeeeeasure!!" `
`When Beato howled, the wedge that had pierced her was blasted away. `
`But the wound remained, and she continued to be tormented by a fierce pain. `
`"You ready? I'll keep going. `
`My blue truth for the last murder in the second game, the three who died in Aunt Natsuhi's room, should still be valid even with the 18th person X denied! `
`Do you have a counterargument for that in red?! `
`If you don't, the second game is all mine too!" `
`"No, I don't!! `
`Fighting over such trivial matters bores me!! `
`I'll give it to you, I'll give you the second game!! `
`Gwaaaaaaaaagghghh!!!! `
`......Fff, ...gwooooooooooohhhh......!!" `
`The instant she acknowledged her loss in the second game, two blue stakes gouged through Beato's chest this time...! `
`The witch's lungs were gouged, as were her intestines. `
`Her face twisted in anguish. `
`Her body twisted as she gasped in pain. `
`"Does it hurt...?" `
`"Huuuuurt? `
`...No, no, this just tickles. `
`Uhhyahhyahyahyahhyaaaaaaahhh!! `
`...At least compared to having your entire body torn to bits and turned into a pile of scrap meat, like your sisteeeeeeeer! `
`I'll make you scrap meat too, then you siblings can be all mixed together like ground beef and pork, *giggle*giggle*, kyahaaaaaaaahhh!!" `
`"Ahh, ...aaaaaarrrrrrrrggggh!! `
`I'll beat you to death, I'll tear you to bits the same way!! `
`Next! `
`The third game!! `
`How long are you gonna sit around, all worn out like that?!! `
`I've only just started knocking you down to hell!!" `
`"...Guh...gah, ...aaaaaaagghhh!! `
`Naturally, as if something like this could wear me down!" `
`"You're right. We're still just getting started! `
`Come, let us begin the third game, starting with the six linked closed rooms! `
`You supposedly did penetrate this closed room at the time. `
`But then you {i:killed off Kinzo}...!!" `
`At the time, I theorized that Gramps was the culprit, `
`and that after killing the other five and stringing the keys across each room, he'd constructed his own closed room in the boiler room... `
`...And that there, he'd died in an accident while carrying out some kind of scheme, burning to death in the boiler. `
`But now I've declared that Gramps was already dead. `
`So I've denied my own theory myself, `
`ironically enough...! `
`However- `
`"There's no problem! `
`{p:2:There are plenty of people who could have committed the crime besides Gramps}! `
`{p:2:You could even claim that the adults who were in the middle of a family conference at the time were all in on it and committed the crime together}!" `
`"{p:1:All five master keys were discovered, each in the pocket of one of the servants}! `
`{p:1:The individual room keys were found inside envelopes alongside the corpses}!" `
`"{p:1:In short, all keys related to the linked locked rooms were locked {i:inside} the linked locked rooms}!! `
`{p:1:No key could have been returned from outside the room using a crack in a door, a crack in a window, a vent or any place of the sort}!!" `
`"{p:2:Then they were killed with poison gas}! `
`{p:2:Even if a key couldn't pass through, gas could, right}?! `
`{p:2:The murder was carried out from outside the locked room}!!" `
`"{p:1:All of them had fatal wounds that appeared to be gunshot wounds}! `
`{p:1:Murdering them from outside the room would have been impossible}!! `
`{p:1:I shall say more with the red}!" `
`"{p:1:When the five other than Kinzo were killed, the killer was always in the same room as them}! `
`{p:1:I already declared in red at the time that there were no suicides}!!" `
`"{p:2:After the murder of each person in their respective rooms, the culprit constructed a linked locked room}. `
`{p:2:But there was no way for the culprit to return the key for the last room to the inside of the locked room}. `
`{p:2:But they did manage to return it}. `
`{p:2:The first person to discover a corpse just had to pretend to find the key and pull it from the corpse's pocket}!!" `
`She couldn't fully block the retort of that blue stake...! `
`Beato was pushed back by the blue wedges that were unleashed on her one after another, finally failed to block one, and once again took a severe wound. `
`"Nnnn, nnnnggg, ...gyaaaaaahhh!!" `
`As she howled in pain, she pulled out the blue wedge that had pierced her right arm. `
`...Beato's entire body had been torn apart and pierced with blue wedges, stakes, and blades, over and over again, `
`and now she was totally covered in blood. `
`But even so, Beato grinned. `
`Cackling as though this was amusing...! `
`"Fuhhahhahhaaaaaaahhh!! `
`How could a man who promised to bring Ange's parents home voice a theory where those parents are culprits?" `
`"Splendid, even that's just fine, riiiiiiight? `
`Go be a big, happy family getting their hands dirty with mass murder, `
`then return to Ange stained with blood that will never come oooooooooff!! `
`How could we expect anything less from the people who returned alive from the witch's islaaaaaaaaaand? `
`Just what that mincemeat Ange neeeeeeeeeeeeeds, hyahhaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!" `
`"Aaaaaarrrrgggghhh, shut uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuupp!! `
`I'll kill you!! `
`I'll tear you apart!! `
`No need to waste your time begging for your life, I'll definitely give you the worst kind of death by my own hands!!" `
`"Yes, you probably could do it...!! `
`I've explored the depths of cruelty for over a thousand years, and you probably will gift me with a fitting end for all that...!!" `
`"Ooh, does that hurt? `
`Is it harsh? `
`Or does it ticckklllllleee?!" `
`"Is that supposed to torment me, come on, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeer, there are still mysteries leeeeeeeeeeeeft!!" `
`Beato had already countered my first powerful move, the 18th person X, `
`by making the number of people on the island 17. `
`But just limiting the number of people to 17 didn't overturn the theory that Aunt Eva was the culprit. `
`I can crush most of the murders in the third game this way...! `
`Blood dripped from all over the body of the Golden Witch... `
`I cornered her, this time thoroughly without mercy. `
`This isn't a game played to decide who wins and who loses. `
`...Yeah, we aren't playing. `
`Even the time I spend playing and fighting like this...delays my trip home. `
`In her isolation, Ange will continue to have her heart torn apart by loneliness and sadness...! `
`I have to go back to Ange as fast as I can!! `
`"......You're all worn out. `
`Standing at death's door, are you?" `
`"...*cackle*cackle* `
`...It still...doesn't burden me... `
`...Something like this......! `
`...*cackle*cackle* It tickles...!!" `
`"It looks like you don't need any mercy." `
`"I never asked for it in the first place." `
`"I'm going all out." `
`"Do so. `
`When our roles were reversed, I showed no mercy. `
`So you ought to do the same when given the chance." `
`"Otherwise, I'll summon another isolated Ange from a different world, `
`and this time, I'll tear off her arms and legs, stick her with a spear and roast her, okaaaaaaayyy?? `
`Uhhyahhaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!" `
`"Shut uuuuuuuuuuup!! `
`Never again!! `
`Not my family! `
`Not my relatives! `
`Not any of the servants!! `
`I won't let you make them your playthings!!" `
`"...I've already broken through all of the mysteries in the fourth game with the blue truth. `
`......The only one left is the very last one from the third game. `
`...Only the murder of Doctor Nanjo." `
`"...Oho, ...have I already been cornered so far...? `
`...*cackle*cackle* What a precarious state I'm in... `
`...Iiihhihhihhihhi, ...ghagh, *cough*cough*!" `
`She coughed violently, spitting up blood. `
`...Her insides had been punched through so many times. `
`It was only natural. `
`"In other words, the mystery of Doctor Nanjo's murder is the last line of defense for you being a witch, right...?" `
`"......As you say. `
`If you defeat that, it will mean that all of my mysteries have been defeated. `
`......Unless I counter one of your truths with some new red truth...or present a new mystery, `
`I...will die." `
`"......... `
`...You don't look like someone who's been pushed into a corner, standing on the brink. `
`...You still have some kind of hidden pitch up your sleeve, right...?" `
`"Well, who knows...? `
`I have already tired of a too-long life after a thousand years...! `
`I've started to think that having this life ended by a rival like you, whom I stumbled upon at the very end, ...might not be so bad." `
`"*cackle*cackle* You can do it, can't you? `
`Do it. `
`...I beg you, kill meeeeeeeee. `
`I'm always the one killing, and I've never had the experience of being kiiiiiilled!" `
`"I've killed the 18 of you hundreds of times, but I haven't been killed myself even once, `
`so I wanted to experience it just once myseeeeeeeeelf, hehihihihihihihihi!!" `
`It was a graceless show of boldness, unchanged from before. `
`...But blood dripped from her mouth, her once beautiful dress was covered with holes, `
`and blood poured from all over her body, making her physical appearance stand in sharp contrast to her attitude. `
`Maybe the shot she'd taken to the flank was still tormenting her, `
`since she was still pressing down on it unconsciously, without a trace of grace. `
`...But I've got no time for pity. `
`As long as I feel sympathy for this witch, my family and I won't be released from this place. `
`...Until I defeat her, we won't be able to go home...!! `
`In the outside world, it may be possible for even enemies to understand each other when circumstances change. `
`But pure evil does exist. `
`Evil that brings misfortune just by existing...and is to be spared no compromise. `
`Just by its continued existence alone, ......it's evil!! `
`"I don't pity you. `
`Just like how you didn't show pity for any of us...!" `
`"......Well, of course. `
`All of you are just pieces in the game! `
`It's just unbelievably fun to think about which six to kill in the beginning, how to kill the next two, `
`and whether I can find a much, much more grotesque method of murder, you seeeeeeeeeee??" `
`"Hey, Battler, I've reformed a little, so forgive me this time too. `
`If you do, I'll change my methods of killing into something a little better, okay? `
`I'll listen to how you want them to be killed and in what order, got iiiiiiit?" `
`"It's so fun, toying with people's liiiiiiiiives!! `
`I'm sure you could think of a way to turn Ange into a pile of scrap meat much, much more thoroughlyyyyyy!! `
`Come, Battleeeeeer!! `
`Try to expose the truth of Nanjo's murdeeeeeeeeeeeer!!" `
`The 18th person X has been defeated. `
`But I won't give in...!! `
`I'll stop that witch's breathing cold!! `
`The end of the third game. `
`It was announced in red that the survivors at that point in time--Battler, Eva, Jessica, `
`and Nanjo--were all uninvolved with Nanjo's murder. `
`And it was also proclaimed that he was murdered directly, by someone before his eyes. `
`All other people had the strongest possible alibi...by having their deaths proclaimed in red... `
`......I'll...break through this, without using the 18th person X...! `
`Think, don't stop thinking...!! `
`Her red doesn't only bind me, it's also supposed to be her weak point...! `
`I've got to somehow use it against her......! `
`............That's right, `
`...there's still a gap...! `
`Yeah, ...this way, I can break through it. `
`This way, {f:5:Beatrice}'s legend of the witch is finished. `
`"...True, the others probably were dead. `
`{p:2:However, the time at which their deaths were declared in red was not the instant Doctor Nanjo died}. `
`{p:2:Strictly speaking, it was in the fight between me and {f:5:Eva} after Doctor Nanjo's corpse was found}." `
`" `
`{p:2:In other words, if someone who was alive at the time that Doctor Nanjo was killed died before {f:5:Eva} proclaimed that death, you can sew right through that crack}!! `
`{p:2:In other words, it's like this}." `
`"{p:2:The culprit was among those people who were not confirmed dead prior to {f:5:Eva}'s declaration of the deaths,} `
`{p:2:and that person had managed to skillfully play dead in the beginning and wait for us to leave them alone}...! `
`{p:2:They made us think that they had died, while their death still hadn't been declared in red}." `
`" `
`{p:2:Then they killed Doctor Nanjo, ......and after that, they died for some reason}! `
`{p:2:Then after that, {f:5:Eva} declared their death in red}!! `
`That theory can explain Doctor Nanjo's murder!!" `
`"How's that, {f:5:Beatrice}?!" `
`When he forcefully asked that question, ...there was a terrible sound that could only be likened to that of a compressor, `
`and a blue stake that was as thick as a log... `
`appeared from under the earth and skewered the Golden Witch, Beato, pulling her up into the air... `
`Ugly tearing sounds rang out, `
`and each time, ...a blue stake or wedge would appear and pierce {f:5:Beatrice}'s body. `
`...When that finally ended... `
`Her tragic form was exposed there, pincushioned by more than ten stakes and wedges all over her body and dripping with blood, ...dangling and crucified... `
`...There was none of the dignity of the brutal witch who had sneered at the honor of the dead and toyed with and killed hundreds of the living. `
`The rain, which had started falling at some point, ...quietly tormented the crucified witch... `
`As Battler heaved with his breathing, he waited for some kind of answer from the Golden Witch... `
`...Although it wasn't long, `
`it took the witch a bit of time to show any signs of life... `
`"......It hurts... `
`...It huuurts......" `
`"...You got...what you...deserved. `
`...Now you can experience a portion of the pain felt by all those you've killed..." `
`Even as he said that, it seemed Battler had lost a little of his momentum at this extremely pathetic sight. `
`...Even if it was an enemy, `
`he couldn't look straight at a woman exposed in such a brutal fashion. `
`But even so, ......unless he destroyed {f:5:Beatrice}, `
`this battle...wouldn't end... `
`"............Battleer, `
`......I beg you...... `
`...hic..." `
`Huh...? `
`...Beato let out a sob... `
`"......It hurts............ `
`......It really `
`...huuuurts...... `
`......End it... `
`......End it...... `
`...Even with this, I still... `
`...can't die... `
`hic... `
`......Even though it hurts so much, `
`......I still... `
`...can't die...... `
`......hic...!" `
`"............What are you... `
`...asking... `
`...of me...?" `
`"......End it...... `
`......Release me......from this pain......" `
`Beato's expression...was soaked with blood and tears. `
`Battler certainly had been tricked by her at one point. `
`...So he was probably able to suspect that her expression...that even her tears were an act. `
`However, ......Battler...believed in those tears. `
`......After all, those tears... `
`had the red of truth mixed in with them. `
`"...What should I do? `
`What can I do to end your pain...?" `
`"............I'm going to... `
`...expose...everything. `
`......This is... `
`......my... `
`heart." `
`"...Your heart......" `
`"......ll...me." `
`"......Beato..." `
`"......Ki `
`...ll `
`...me... `
`......Just... `
`...let... `
`me... `
`die...... `
`...hic, `
`......nngaaaahhhh......" `
`Were those tears from pain and torment, ...or else... `
`Either way, that pathetic expression... `
`was painful for Battler to look at, even after burning with such anger... `
`"...Quickly, ......go back...to...Ange......" `
`"I'll listen to your request. `
`Not so that I can go back, ...but to end your pain." `
`"...............Than... `
`ou... `
`......Battleeer...... `
`...nnnngggggg..." `
`In her last breaths, Beato summoned up all of her remaining strength... `
`and managed to close both of her hands into fists... `
`A red light began to gather at those fists. `
`......Then she lifted her arms, `
`......as though appealing to the heavens for something... `
`"...You'll......be able to kill me... `
`......All of me... `
`...My heart...... `
`......Crush it. `
`......Pierce it. `
`......Okay...?" `
`The red light around both her arms gradually began to strengthen... `
`"......Ple...a......" `
`After saying that much, ...her face tilted to the side a bit. `
`Then, her right arm lost its light and flopped down. `
`...But her left arm alone did not lose its light...and remained held out towards the heavens. `
`Then, ......before Battler's eyes, `
`another Beato appeared with a faint form, transparent like a curtain. `
`...The crucified Beato had already lost consciousness. `
`However, the newly appeared faint Beato quietly looked at me, `
`...her eyes expressionless, `
`......and spoke. `
`"...... `
`{p:1:Ushiromiya Battler}. `
`{p:1:I will now kill you}." `
`"......And...?" `
`"...... `
`{p:1:And right now,} `
`{p:1:there is no one other than you on this island}. `
`{p:1:The only one alive on this island is you}. `
`{p:1:Nothing outside the island can interfere}." `
`...I...understand. `
`This is... `
`the "last mystery" {f:5:Beatrice} will be able to make as a witch. `
`She's...trying to offer it to me. `
`Entreating me...to solve this final mystery... `
`and kill her... `
`"Do it...... `
`I'll accept...your final mystery." `
`"......... `
`{p:1:You are all alone on this island}. `
`{p:1:And of course, I am not you}. `
`{p:1:Yet I am here, now, and am about to kill you}." `
`"Like a souped‐up version of the mystery of Doctor Nanjo's murder...... `
`......So...?" `
`"......Who...aaam I...?" `
`"Is that......your final question?" `
`{a:c: `
`"......Who... `
`...am I.........?" `
`} `
`Then, ...{f:5:Beatrice} slowly approached me and, still expressionless, ......held me... `
`......Yeah, I get it, Beato. `
`I'll......kill you, don't worry...... `
`I also...slowly held her head. `
`......Then I, as a piece, `
`left the game board... `
