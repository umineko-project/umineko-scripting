`"Wahahahaha, you all right, Battler-kun...?! `
`We're already on the ground, and you can't fall any further than that, wahahahaha...!" `
`"Uu-, hahahahahaha! `
`Faaall, faaall, hahahahaha!" `
`In the lobby of the Niijima airport, Maria dashed around in excitement. `
`Battler's uproar on the plane must have been hilarious. `
`"Hey, Maria! `
`Cut that out! `
`...I'm sorry, Battler-kun. `
`Please don't take it badly." `
`"What a pathetic guy you are. `
`Even with that huge body, you still can't handle vehicles?" `
`"Ah, shut up... `
`All humans have one or two things they can't handle..." `
`"Battler-kun, why don't you come with your aunt on an overseas trip sometime soon? `
`How about Europe? `
`I'm sure you could manage a half-day trip on a plane. `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*!" `
`"...Stop it, Mother. `
`Battler-kun's dislike for vehicles is probably genetic." `
`"Oh, you mean Asumu-san?" `
`"...For some reason, she just couldn't handle vehicles. `
`Pretty much anything other than a bicycle or a car. `
`Whenever we tried to go far away, that woman was so annoying with the 'not this, not that, `
`I'm scared, I'm scared, fall, fall, gyaah, gyaah'." `
`"Children tend to learn that things their parents can't handle are dangerous. `
`I'm sure Battler-kun saw Asumu-san doing something like that and learned that vehicles are scary." `
`"*giggle*giggle* `
`So it's Asumu-san's genes then, is it?" `
`"Who knows. `
`Those would be some pretty annoying genes. `
`......That's enough talking about Asumu. `
`Right now, you're the one who's here. `
`Right?" `
`"...You're right, sorry." `
`"Heeey, the cars are here! `
`Exactly three of them. `
`Get in, get in!" `
`"Fall, faaall!! `
`Where's the parachuuute, where's the parachuuute?!! `
`Uu-uu-, *giggle*!!" `
`"Why you little!! `
`Hold on, hold on, stop right there! `
`I'll sentence you to the little girl tickle punishmeeent!!" `
`"Heheheheheh. `
`Being in high spirits is such a wonderful thing. `
`Without Battler-kun and Maria-chan, the atmosphere in that plane would have been pretty grim." `
`"Thanks. `
`I'll assume you mean that literally. `
`...Hey, brats! `
`The taxis are here! `
`You can play around later." `
`"Uu-uu-!! `
`Taxiii, taxiii!! `
`I'm getting in fiiirst! `
`*giggle*!!" `
`"Hey! `
`Maria, and you too, Battler-kun, stop fooling around! `
`You'll bump into someone!" `
`The tone of Aunt Rosa's voice grew a little frightening. `
`When even Battler realized they were fooling around a bit too much, ...just as expected, he bumped into someone. `
`"Oh, sorry..." `
`"Battler-kun, you guys are going in that car. `
`You're keeping them waiting." `
`After George urged him to hurry on, Battler apologized to the person he had bumped into and ran up to his parents, who were telling him to come quickly. `
`With a clunking sound, the doors on the three taxis were shut one after another, and they departed for the harbor... `
`...As their taxis dashed away... `
`The entire world grew suddenly dull... `
`and slowed to a halt. `
`Voices, the wind, and even sound... `
`All of it stopped, and all the people who were trying to move froze like the instant someone takes a photo, `
`...coming to a halt. `
`People and machines and clock hands, even the dust dancing in the wind, ...were frozen. `
`Some people who were walking froze with one leg still in the air. `
`Scraps of paper dancing in the wind were pinned in midair, frozen in place. `
`...Then, among the shadows standing still in this unmoving world, a single one stirred. `
`It was a girl. `
`The girl Battler had just bumped into... `
`Though she had moved, it was a truly subtle thing. `
`Her gaze dropped, her shoulders lowered a miniscule amount, and she sighed. `
`...That was all. `
`In a normal world, that probably wouldn't even be taken as movement, `
`but in this still world, it looked very out of place. `
`...Then, something else moved. `
`It was a black cat wandering around the shadows near the taxi rank. `
`It came up right behind the girl... `
`and leisurely...changed its form into that of a Human. `
`This was no cat. `
`It was a witch. `
`Of course, the girl was also a witch. `
`As the witch stood still, her gaze still downwards, she muttered... `
`"......I can't... `
`stop everyone from going to Rokkenjima, can I...?" `
`"You cannot. `
`On October 4, 1986, you are not here." `
`"...If I were, would stopping everyone really have been possible...?" `
`"Well, I can't imagine what a six-year-old girl could do `
`to make them turn back. `
`...Still, that's right. `
`If you were in this place, the probability wouldn't have been zero. `
`Whenever there's a probability greater than zero, I can seek out a miracle." `
`"...If I hadn't been sick, `
`...and they hadn't left me behind..." `
`With her head facing downwards, the witch tightened her fists... `
`...They were trembling very slightly. `
`"You were sick in bed starting October 3, 1986. `
`And Beato's game board is sealed off starting October 4. `
`...You are not given a chance to avoid getting sick. `
`...In other words, it would normally be absolutely impossible for you to enter her game board." `
`"Thanks for being patronizing. `
`...I know that. `
`...I know that just seeing Father, Mother, `
`......and Onii-chan healthy like this... `
`...even that alone... `
`is a spectacular miracle..." `
`.........I know that all too well..." `
`Ange had tried to stand in the way of her family, attempting to stop them from leaving the airport...and heading towards Rokkenjima. `
`...However, it was impossible for her to exist in October 4, 1986, so she couldn't do it. `
`Even though her brother had only bumped into her and apologized... `
`...Even though he hadn't known that she was his sister, `
`...it had been such a miracle... `
`that she could cry... `
`"......Sorry about the sarcasm. `
`I won't waste the miracle you've given me." `
`"I'm glad to hear it. `
`...Come, let us go with them. `
`To Rokkenjima. `
`All of the pieces are already gathered. `
`...The curtain will open on the fourth game. `
`By this time, Beato and Battler will already be seated." `
`"......To Rokkenjima...... `
`............To where my... `
`...no, `
`...to where everyone's fates changed, ...the Rokkenjima... `
`of October 4, 1986......" `
`...What happened on that day? `
`I'll expose it. `
`I'll learn what it is. `
`And I'll bring them back...! `
`As she stood there with her fists still clenched, she surely turned her face up to the heavens. `
`A single teardrop from the depths of her eyes dripped down into the air. `
`And when time started moving again, the two witches' figures were swallowed up by a blowing gale and erased in an instant. `
