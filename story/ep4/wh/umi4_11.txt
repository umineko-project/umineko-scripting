`It was already approaching 10:00 at night. `
`By now, the typhoon had wrapped itself around Rokkenjima. `
`Even the rose garden that had looked so beautiful midday... `
`was beaten down upon by the fierce winds and resisted with all its might, undulating and trying to keep the flowers from blowing away... `
`In that rose garden...was Shannon in the lead, Battler holding up an umbrella, Jessica, and George carrying the sleeping Maria on his back, all heading for the guesthouse. `
`"We can at least make it to the guesthouse from here. `
`Shannon-chan, it's fine, you should go back and rest." `
`"Don't worry, seeing you off is also part of my duty..." `
`"The family conference is going on inside, and Mom and Genji-san are probably getting stressed. `
`If we keep you, they'll misunderstand and think you were being lazy." `
`"That's right. `
`Just graciously accepting our offer might be the best way to avoid burdening people. `
`...Thank you, Shannon." `
`"Not at all. `
`...Certainly, as Milady has said, it is very tense inside the mansion today. `
`Therefore, coming with all of you allowed me a breath of fresh air, and I've been able to relax a bit." `
`"The family conference, huh? `
`......They went to all the trouble of chasing us kids out, so they're probably talking about something shady." `
`"Probably. `
`I'm sure there's nothing we can do to help out. `
`Just trying to stay out of their way is probably the best way for us to be useful." `
`"Heh...! `
`I'm sure it's all just "Money money money!". `
`...Even though they act like they're so rich most of the time, when it gets tough, they all start getting pushy. `
`Why don't they just be graceful and split it evenly between everyone?" `
`"Ihihi. `
`That'd be awesome. `
`It'd be nice if I got a share too. `
`If I got some too, I'd split it with Shannon-chan right away." `
`"Th-Thank you very much... `
`Well, I appreciate the sentiment." `
`"Shannon isn't greedy at all. `
`Normally, girls of your age would have tons of things they'd want to buy." `
`"I guess. `
`But none of the things I want can be bought with money." `
`"Ooh! `
`How unselfish! `
`If you lined up all the things I wanted, all the gold in the world wouldn't be enough." `
`"That's if you're talking about things that can be bought with money. `
`I wonder what these "things that can't be bought with money" that Shannon wants are. `
`Do you have any idea, George nii-san?" `
`"W-Well, I wonder. `
`I'm not Shannon, so how could I know?" `
`"I-I don't know either." `
`George and Shannon looked down, their faces red. `
`Battler had also heard about what was going on with them, so he knew what Jessica was teasing them about. `
`"George-aniki is a person I respect. `
`I think you've met up with a really great person, Shannon-chan." `
`"Yeah. `
`I also feel relieved that we can leave Shannon to George nii-san." `
`"St-Stop teasing. `
`It's a serious issue for us. `
`More importantly, what about you, Jessica-chan? `
`Have you been able to get a little closer to Kanon-kun?" `
`"Whaaaaaaaaat?! `
`So, you and Kanon-kun are like that?!" `
`"Ah, um, well!! `
`Th-That's dirty, George, twisting the conversation around like that's dirty!" `
`As they had an animated discussion with ups and downs, `
`the four kids headed for the guesthouse... `
`The annual family conference was extremely important to the Ushiromiya family, `
`and this year seemed like it was going to be especially important. `
`Apparently, the Family Head, Kinzo, was personally going to be making a very serious announcement, `
`and everyone other than the adults had been strictly ordered to leave. `
`Battler hadn't attended the family conference in six years, so he didn't really notice, `
`but according to Jessica, there seemed to be a very tense atmosphere tonight, `
`completely different from a normal year. `
`...Common sense made it clear that Kinzo, whose remaining life was short, `
`was going to make some big announcement about the succession of the Headship and the distribution of his fortune... `
`"But I'm suprised. `
`......To think that Grandfather's actually gonna make an appearance..." `
`"...I see. `
`So, this is the witch's counterattack." `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*! `
`I wanted to leave the Joker called Kinzo face-down a little longer, but it's probably about time to turn it over. `
`Trump cards exist to be used. `
`*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"Damn. `
`My theory that Grandfather was dead since the beginning, and a different 18th person had snuck in, `
`...is now suddenly torn apart." `
`"I had foreseen that you'd begin to doubt Kinzo eventually...! `
`Yes, now your reasoning has all gone back to square one again, right?" `
`"With this, your theory that Kinzo was dead at the very beginning and I was hiding as the 18th person goes poof! `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!" `
`"......Fuck... `
`But no way I'll lose heart. `
`That's only one theory gone. `
`I'll attack you like a storm, like a tornado......" `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`I'd have it no other way! `
`Even the first twilight has not yet begun. `
`It is far too early to give up. `
`"That's right. `
`And, it's not like it was denied with the red truth. `
`......At this point in time, Battler's theory hasn't been defeated. `
`It's too early to say that you've won." `
`"Nn, yeah, that's right. `
`...It's still too early for me to just swallow her story. `
`...Grandfather is supposed to finally appear, `
`but there's a chance that they'll talk about how his health has gotten worse, and he won't appear after all." `
`"...Uncle Krauss might be trying desperately `
`to hide the fact that Grandfather really is dead until the last second." `
`"Ha...! `
`I see, I see, you could also think of it that way. `
`Do as you please. `
`It will be resolved soon. `
`Very soon... `
`*cackle*cackle*...!" `
`All of the relatives and Nanjo could be seen in the dining hall. `
`Nanjo sat alone, quietly watching the wind and rain outside. `
`Krauss sat down in the seat of his own rank, with Natsuhi standing motionlessly at his side. `
`The other siblings were gathered at the opposite end of the long table, whispering to each other... `
`"...Is that true?" `
`"Yes. `
`......Maria said...the person who gave her the umbrella... `
`was Father." `
`"What in the world...? `
`In other words, our strategy has collapsed from the roots...!" `
`"Not just our strategy. `
`Since Father is healthy and has said that he'll make an announcement himself, our trivial bargaining with Nii-san was completely pointless." `
`"Yep. `
`...That old bastard. `
`Why couldn't he have just shown himself right away without making a show of it? `
`Thanks to that, we've just been quarreling with Aniki uselessly." `
`"......Or maybe he wanted to test us on that point. `
`I might not be one to talk, since we aren't related by blood, but your Father is very intelligent, correct?" `
`"Our arguments during the day were probably overheard by one of the servants and reported to Father. `
`......Incredible. `
`The fact that we were making a fuss with Father's inheritance as our goal is now right in the open... `
`......Ah, just incredible..." `
`Eva uncharacteristically held her head, dejected. `
`If, as Kyrie had said, everything had been going according to Kinzo's plans from the beginning, `
`and if this was a huge setup that had been kept up for over a year, trying to find the siblings' true intentions, `
`then they had fallen for it completely... `
`"...We still don't know for sure that it's reached Father's ears." `
`"No, it definitely has! `
`...Everyone but Nii-san claimed that Father was dead, and none of us believed in Father's good health...! `
`Aaah, it's already over... `
`...Father will make an announcement. `
`Nii-san will become the Successor, and he'll say we aren't even qualified to wear the One Wing... `
`......Ahhh, I............" `
`"Nee-san, ...get ahold of yourself..." `
`"...Rosa-san, `
`I wonder if Maria really received that umbrella from Father." `
`"Huh? `
`What do you mean...?" `
`"...Maria-chan might have seen Father. `
`However, we haven't seen him. `
`Maria-chan only claims to have seen him." `
`"What are you saying...? `
`...Are you saying Maria's lying?!" `
`"Calm down, Rosa. `
`...Maria-chan didn't necessarily lie. `
`Still, she's an innocent kid, right?" `
`"...For example, if Genji-san came up to her and said something like "I was told by your Grandfather to hand this to you, Maria-sama", `
`then even if Maria-chan hadn't met Dad, she still might say that she got an umbrella from him, right?" `
`"...Th-That's right. `
`That trick could work...!" `
`"But what was it Maria-chan said? `
`"Grandfather came and handed me the umbrella"." `
`"Yes, that's what she said. `
`She clearly said that she received an umbrella directly from Grandfather." `
`"...Directly, huh? `
`Then we're stuck." `
`"............... `
`They often say that bad thinking is no better than sleeping. `
`If you think about it a bit, all of this about the umbrella is a trivial problem." `
`"Why's that? `
`Couldn't Maria-chan have been bribed by Nii-san to lie and say something that made it seem like Father was in good health?! `
`There is no evidence that Father actually handed the umbrella to her...!" `
`"Regardless of whom Maria-chan received the umbrella from, `
`assuming she was even given an umbrella in the first place, `
`Father will appear very soon. `
`Once Father's in front of us, the problem with the umbrella will become completely trivial." `
`"......In other words, this is not the time to gossip about the umbrella issue." `
`"What do you mean, this isn't the time?" `
`"......I see, ...I got it. `
`...This is probably what Kyrie-san's sayin'. `
`......Father is supposed to come here very soon, `
`but the chance still remains that he'll get mad again and won't show up, right...?" `
`"...I-I see. `
`That's true... `
`Maybe Nii-san just said Father was going to appear at random in a desperate bid to buy time against our investigation. `
`Father really is dead already, `
`and Nii-san is still lying and saying he's healthy...!" `
`"In short, if Father appears, then no schemes will be effective. `
`There's no need to even think about that case. `
`We're fish on the chopping board. `
`We'd have no choice but to leave fate to the heavens and negotiate directly with Father. `
`That means we'd have no choice but to let him clobber us with his fist, then prostrate ourselves and beg for money." `
`"...But on the other hand, if Father doesn't appear, then our primary strategy isn't hampered in the least." `
`"......I see. `
`In short, no matter which way it goes, there's absolutely no need to get flustered now." `
`"That's it. `
`If Father shows up, we just have to carry out the normal family conference. `
`......If he doesn't, we just have to keep on investigating Krauss-san." `
`"We can't let him talk his way out of it, `
`...like if he says Father's mood has suddenly gotten worse." `
`"...It seems what we really should be trying to figure out... `
`is what scheme Nii-san is going to try and trick us with. `
`The way he just doesn't know how to give up is something I know better than anyone." `
`"If Father is well, ...we'll prostrate ourselves and beg for money. `
`...If it's a farce of Krauss-san's, then we'll continue our ugly sibling fight. `
`......It sounds like this year's family conference is going to be just wonderful." `
`"Yep. `
`So, bad thinking is no better than sleeping, huh? `
`It's almost 22:00. `
`...Should we press Aniki?" `
`Rudolf and the rest looked at Krauss. `
`He was sitting down firmly...and looked like he was awaiting Kinzo's arrival with an air of composure. `
`...They couldn't tell if he really was composed, ...or if he was scheming about how to tie together his lie. `
`"......Dear..." `
`"...Calm yourself. `
`We won't get anywhere by making a fuss after all this. `
`......Let's leave it to Genji-san." `
`"It's almost...10:00, isn't it?" `
`That was the time that had been set for tonight's family conference to open. `
`And, it was the time that the Ushiromiya Family Head needed to appear... `
`Right then, they heard the sound of footsteps approaching from the hall. `
`There were multiple sets. `
`Natsuhi raised her head, relieved... `
`But because of the sound of a knock, her expression was filled with disappointment. `
`Because Kinzo probably wouldn't have knocked. `
`"...Please excuse us. `
`I have finished closing up the mansion for the night." `
`It was Gohda and Kumasawa. `
`Unlike the powerful Gohda, `
`it was rare for Kumasawa, with her old body, to be forced to work this late. `
`Of course, Krauss also seemed to know that. `
`"Indeed. `
`Good work. `
`......My apologies for making you work at such a time, Kumasawa-san." `
`"Oh, it's nothing. `
`I may not look it, but staying up late is still one of my specialties. `
`Hohohohoh...!" `
`"...Wouldn't it be okay to at least let Kumasawa leave without being an observer? `
`It really will be difficult on her body, I imagine." `
`"......The order was to gather all of the servants as well. `
`I cannot disobey." `
`Tonight's family conference was clearly different from normal. `
`On a normal year, no one was allowed to attend except family members. `
`To have the servants present for such a thing...was unthinkable. `
`But this year was different. `
`All of the servants were told to attend. `
`Of course, they were not allowed to talk. `
`......They were there as observers. `
`Just what in the world was happening that needed to be observed by five servants? `
`...Even Krauss didn't know. `
`"Hohohoh. `
`I don't look it, but I'm good at staying up late. `
`If you stuff yourself with mackerel too, Krauss-sama, you'll be more manly at night." `
`"Hahahaha. `
`I see you're still in high spirits. `
`I'm sure you'll be working in such high spirits until you're a hundred." `
`"Madam, `
`forgive my arrogance, but I have prepared a light snack. `
`I can serve it at any time, so feel free to order it." `
`"Thank you. `
`You really are considerate. `
`...Please offer refills of coffee to the others." `
`"Certainly." `
`After nodding, Gohda took the pot towards the relatives gathered at the other end of the table. `
`As he did, more footsteps approached from the hallway. `
`...It was a single set. `
`And it was light. `
`Even before the knock, they could imagine who it was. `
`"Excuse me... `
`I've taken the children to the guesthouse." `
`"Good work. `
`Tonight is a special evening. `
`Make sure you stay alert." `
`"Y-Yes. `
`Certainly, Madam..." `
`Genji had gone with Kanon to meet Kinzo. `
`...There was still no sign of their return. `
`The hand of the clock passed 22:00 slightly. `
`Once sure of that, Eva spoke to Krauss. `
`"...Nii-saaan? `
`It's time. `
`Are you still not going to start the family conference?" `
`"......The arrival of the guest of honor has been delayed. `
`Wait a short while." `
`"How long? `
`Sorry, but time's up. `
`I won't have you saying "Father hasn't quite shown up yet" over and over until dawn." `
`"How could I make a promise about the time Father shows up? `
`Why are you in such a rush? `
`Why not drink some tea and calm down for now...?" `
`"Aniki, we're gathered here for a family conference. `
`Not a farce. `
`We'll wait 30 more minutes. `
`But if that doesn't work, you'll let us break into the study, okay?" `
`"B-Break into... `
`Such an action would be quite lacking in respect for the Head!" `
`"Oh, right, our apologies. `
`We'll be good for 30 more minutes. `
`Hehheheheh..." `
`".........Hmph." `
`"......... `
`I look forward to seeing if you can keep that same smile up 30 minutes from now." `
`"...So, you honestly believe that Father is dead?" `
`"I have no desire to discuss that now. `
`We can wait until Father comes here. `
`There's absolutely no need for me to argue you down, Nii-san." `
`"The Ushiromiya Headship will be passed on to the proper person in the proper manner. `
`...No matter what you may scheme, you cannot resist. `
`Of course, the same goes for me." `
`"What are you trying to say? `
`...And after bragging all these years about being the Successor yourself...!" `
`"I'll turn your own words back on you. `
`I have no desire to discuss that now. `
`All that matters is for Father to come here and proclaim it with his own mouth. `
`There's absolutely no need for me to argue you down. `
`...Right? `
`Heheheh!" `
`Krauss casually turned Eva's words back on her. `
`Of course, that added oil to Eva's anger. `
`But it didn't ignite. `
`Because, in that instant, the sound of a very loud knock rang out. `
`Both Genji and Kanon were usually very reserved when they knocked. `
`They wouldn't hit the door with such a violent strength. `
`...It was like a judge's gavel slamming down in a call for silence. `
`So, everyone went quiet... `
`The door opened slightly, ...and Genji showed himself. `
`Then, he spoke with a serious tone different from his usual one. `
`It wasn't the tone he used when carrying out his duties. `
`...It was the tone he used when speaking for Kinzo himself. `
`So just by hearing Genji speak like that, the siblings were struck with a sudden tension. `
`"Take your seats, everyone." `
`At those words, the dining hall was wrapped in total silence, and everyone hurriedly returned to their designated seats. `
`It was as though students who had been bustling around just before homeroom had suddenly returned to their seats when the teacher came, `
`and it might even have looked humorous. `
`...But there was no way anyone would joke about it. `
`Everyone sat in order, and Shannon, Gohda, and Kumasawa stood up straight in a row by the wall. `
`"...The Head of the glorious Ushiromiya family and lord of Rokkenjima, the island that sparkles gold, `
`...Lord Ushiromiya Kinzo has arrived." `
`Of the double doors that led to the dining hall, Genji opened the right door from the inside, and Kanon opened the left door from the outside. `
`...And, welcomed by a respectful bow from those two, majestically fluttering his cape, ......Kinzo appeared... `
`Kinzo's gait had a dignified weight to it, and it was hard to believe that he had reportedly been at the end of his life. `
`Genji pulled back Kinzo's seat and motioned for him to sit. `
`But Kinzo stayed standing, signaling with his chin for Genji to move back. `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* Fuhhahahahahahahahahaha...!! `
`Welcome to Rokkenjima, ladies and gentlemen. `
`Why the frightened face, Evaa?" `
`"N-No, why would I be frightened...! `
`I'm just relieved to find you in excellent spirits, Father..." `
`"Wahhahhahhahhahhahha...!! `
`Evaa, you're as amusing as ever, aren't yoou? `
`Why don't you just honestly say how frustrated you are at losing your bet with Krauss? `
`...*cackle*cackle* You can't say it, can you? `
`*cackle*cackle*!!" `
`Eva realized that their conversation during the day had indeed been leaked to Kinzo, and she hung her head, turning red. `
`"Well then, my sons and daughters and their companions! `
`Tonight, I shall make an important announcement regarding my inheritance and the succession that you all seem so keen on." `
`"But first! `
`I must tell you how incredibly disappointed I am. `
`After all, until this very day, no one has been able to solve the riddle of the epitaph." `
`Even though Kinzo said he was disappointed, `
`a condescending smile rose to his face, as though there was no way the likes of these could've solved it, and his gaze passed through all of them. `
`"...I had planned to hand over everything to the one who could solve it. `
`But none have been able to solve it before today, and here we stand, with nothing of mine passed down to anyone." `
`"How shameful...!! `
`To think that not one among you has come forward with the qualifications to succeed me! `
`How truly disappointing, and shameful, and patheetic!! `
`Wahhahhahhahhahhahha!!" `
`The siblings hung their heads in silence. `
`Of course, they would have solved it if they could. `
`True, they couldn't deny that they'd wasted a golden opportunity, but it was just so hard... `
`"Therefore, `
`I am proclaiming here and now that I will suspend the use of the epitaph's riddle as a method of choosing my successor. `
`In short, time's up! `
`This is game over. `
`...And what a shame for you all. `
`Even though it should have given you all an equal and fair chance, that's gone now! `
`......Gehhahahahah!!" `
`It truly sounded like Kinzo was making a victory proclamation. `
`"In that case, will my oldest son Krauss succeed the Headship...? `
`*cackle*cackle*! `
`The answer is <no>!!" `
`"Wha...?!" `
`"......" `
`"...You understand, right, Krauuss? `
`I certainly gave you the title of Successor. `
`But all you did was let it go to your head... `
`Do you know what a Successor is...?" `
`"......It means...the person who will inherit your position after you, Father..." `
`"WROOOOOOONNNNNNGGGGG!! `
`The position of Successor isn't something that's guaranteed by the current Head at aaaaaaaaaaall!" `
`"......Listen up, Krauuss. `
`I won't tell you this again. `
`A Successor... `
`is what you call someone who finds everyone else who's after the Headship, `
`thoroughly breaks their noses, and makes it so they can never disobey him again." `
`"This is not only something that can be said of the Headship. `
`It's the same with money! `
`A "rich person" doesn't mean someone who has money. `
`It means someone who crushes everyone who had more money than himself, `
`and who scrabbles together more money than anyone else." `
`"It's the same with talent. `
`A genius is not what you call a person blessed with talent! `
`It means a person who crushes everyone with more talent than themselves! `
`A person who can coerce geniuses and all other people to call them that using strength and charisma!! `
`You have a mistaken impression when it comes to all of these things. `
`...So, you aren't of the right caliber to be my Successor. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!" `
`"...I-I'll take your words to heart..." `
`Perhaps that truly was Kinzo's philosophy. `
`As a result of faithfully carrying out that rant-like philosophy of his, `
`Kinzo had glorified the Ushiromiya family to the state it was in today... `
`It may be hard to imagine after his immersion in the occult in recent years, `
`but that brutally overbearing outlook was no more or less than Ushiromiya Kinzo's charisma and aura... `
`"Such an unsatisfactory person is not qualified to inherit everything of the Ushiromiya family. `
`In that case, is Eva, Rudolf, or Rosa qualified?" `
`"Again, <no>!! `
`You were unable to solve the riddle, and you were also unable to use a scheme to drag Krauss down! `
`All the three of you managed to do was gather together in a united front to try and extort money from Krauss. `
`And even that scheme was thoughtless! `
`You can't even corner Krauss all by himself! `
`......There could be nothing more shameful!" `
`"You lack the avarice to steal away the position of Successor by any means!! `
`In order to get what you want, you should sacrifice everything, becoming as covetous and greedy as possible...!! `
`The goddess of luck smiles upon the greedy!! `
`You three, who don't have that wild spirit, are as unfit for the succession as Krauss is!!" `
`Eva and the rest had no words to respond with. `
`And they couldn't calculate what it was Kinzo was about to say... `
`Was Kinzo actually planning to proclaim that no one would succeed the Headship? `
`If so, that would work to Eva, Rosa, and Rudolf's advantage. `
`After all, in the end, they'd just have to renegotiate everything among the siblings after Kinzo's death, splitting the inheritance evenly. `
`It would surely be more troublesome if a specific person's name was raised and proclaimed to be the Successor. `
`...But would Kinzo really say something to benefit any of the four siblings after demeaning them so much? `
`"...You don't think...he's going to say that because no one will succeed him, `
`he'll donate all of his fortune to charity or something, right...?" `
`"......I'm afraid I wouldn't put it past Father." `
`"The blood's just risen to his head... `
`We can't do anything but let him talk for now." `
`"...W-Well then, Father. `
`What thoughts do you have regarding the Succession of the Headship?" `
`"Hmph...... `
`Since I am so utterly disappointed in all of you, I've lost the desire to hand it over to anyone. `
`Therefore, the Ushiromiya family will end here. `
`It ends with my generation." `
`"...Th-That cannot..." `
`"The Ushiromiya family was crushed long ago in that earthquake. `
`The current Ushiromiya family is nothing but an illusion of gold I'm glimpsing for an instant. `
`...The likes of which will end when I awaken from my slumber. `
`Hehheheh! `
`Everything in this world is a dream, an illusion. `
`...Life is but a daydream before the awakening called death. `
`Aaah, yes, that's how it was from the beginning!! `
`That I should lose everything when I die was part of {f:5:Beatrice}'s contract, and her curse! `
`Fuhahaha!! `
`As if I'd let you, {f:5:Beatrice}! `
`I will be the one who captures you!! `
`Tonight, that goal will be realized. `
`*cackle*cackle*! `
`Wahhahahahahaha!!" `
`For a while, Kinzo was overcome with cackling, and his eyes bulged. `
`Whenever he talked about {f:5:Beatrice}, it was always both eloquent and insane... `
`"Foolish children such as yourselves truly are daydreams!! `
`It's as though you were never there from the beginning!! `
`Disappear! Wake up!! `
`Disappear from the doze of the truth that I am...!! `
`You failures that have not built up anything that makes you worthy to succeed me!!" `
`"K-Kinzo-san. `
`If I may..." `
`"What is it, `
`my friend?" `
`Nanjo nervously raised his hand, asking to speak. `
`Kinzo allowed him to. `
`"I understand how you feel, Kinzo-san. `
`Because you love your children, you expect a lot of them, `
`and as a parent and grandparent myself, `
`I understand how parental affection can make you feel as though your expectations were betrayed." `
`"...However, you are extraordinary, Kinzo-san. `
`A genius. `
`Isn't saying that it's only natural for them to catch up to you a little too harsh...? `
`Despite that, Krauss-san, Eva-san, Rudolf-san, Rosa-san, `
`and all of their partners have done their very best to catch up with you..." `
`"Hohoooooooooohhh??? `
`And just how much money have they built up with this "Doing their best"? `
`After these cowards fail completely in ventures and gain debt, `
`and still try to sponge off me, how can you say that they did their very best...?!!" `
`"Money is the crystallization of everything in this world. `
`If you cannot grasp that, then you cannot grasp the world! `
`If a life cannot strongly grasp this world, it doesn't deserve to live!! `
`Disappear!! `
`Disappear from my life and reality!!" `
`"...That's a reckless argument. `
`With that logic, even I must not live. `
`...Even so, I believe the time I spend playing chess with you was worthwhile for both of us, Kinzo-san... `
`...You should know better than anyone else that there are many things in this world that cannot be bought with money." `
`"......Hmm. `
`...Hmph." `
`As the siblings motionlessly hung their heads, they cheered Nanjo on inside their hearts. `
`Not one of the siblings could offer their opinion in front of Kinzo in a rage, but Kinzo's close friend Nanjo alone was allowed to... `
`Even though Kinzo had raged so fiercely, after being admonished by Nanjo, he nodded several times as though in agreement. `
`...This surprisingly obedient side of him might have seemed cute, but there was no one here who could laugh. `
`"It may be true that your children haven't built up as great a fortune as you have, Kinzo-san. `
`...Though, even so, they're rich enough to make me jealous." `
`"But besides money, they have also built up many things that cannot be bought with money. `
`When it comes to that, they are in no way inferior to you, Kinzo-san." `
`"Hoh. `
`And what do you claim they have built up that cannot be bought with money?" `
`"Happiness. `
`Family. `
`...They have found wonderful partners, had children, and each has built up their own happy homes. `
`They have glorified your family name...and have brought back grandchildren." `
`"Grandchildren are wonderful. `
`We older people can look at these young grandchildren, who will live on into a new era that we will not even be given a chance to see, and in them, we can imagine an endless future. `
`...Isn't that the sole entertainment we have in our old age?" `
`"Remember, Kinzo-san. `
`Remember your joy when they first brought back their grandchildren...! `
`Your children and your grandchildren...will carry your great works on to future generations, setting an example. `
`That is something that an individual cannot accomplish no matter how much money they have." `
`The siblings all nodded in agreement... `
`Certainly, Kinzo had looked happy when his grandchildren had just been born. `
`...Back when he still had some sanity in his heart. `
`...However, did Kinzo's heart still contain a Human's warmth...? `
`"In other words, `
`in exchange for the vast riches I created, `
`instead of gaining money, I have gained my grandchildren?!" `
`"N-No, no, that's not what I..." `
`"So, in exchange for the several tens of billions in wealth that I have built up, I have gained a single grandchild from each of my children!!" `
`"Hahhahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`This is wonderful! `
`So, I have created a single life using ten billion yen! `
`That's how it is! `
`Interesting, truly an interesting example in the alchemical sense, riight...?!" `
`"Hooh, what valuable grandchildren! `
`Wonderful, ...wonderful!! `
`Wahhahhahhahhahha!! `
`Is that right, Krauss? `
`...Is your daughter worth ten billion yen...?" `
`"......" `
`Krauss couldn't answer instantly. `
`...It wasn't that he didn't have confidence in his daughter. It was because he didn't have a clue what Kinzo was trying to test him with in this question. `
`But when Natsuhi was then pressed for an answer, she responded, breaking Krauss's silence with an answer of her own interpretation. `
`"...Y-Yes. `
`Jessica is a daughter I wouldn't let go of even for ten billion yen. `
`In that sense, I believe she has a value that can't be measured with money." `
`"Hoh. `
`So, you can state for certain that she's worth ten billion. `
`Hoh hoh! `
`What about you, Eva? `
`What about your George...?" `
`Since Natsuhi had answered that way, Eva naturally came up with her own answer as well. `
`...Even though Eva should have known better than to respond to a provocative question like this, she answered as well. `
`"Yes, Father. `
`George is worth ten billion...no, even more than that. `
`And that's not in the abstract sense of things money can't buy. `
`George will certainly build up a fortune equal to his worth. `
`He'll become a grandson worthy of carrying on your great works, Father...!" `
`Eva sent a glance at Hideyoshi and Natsuhi as if she'd scored a point. `
`...When she heard what Eva had said, Natsuhi was about to add more praise for her daughter, but stopped at a glare from Krauss. `
`"Hmm, I see. `
`......Then what about you, Rudolf? `
`What about your Battler?" `
`"Compared to George-kun, ...there's nothing about Battler I can brag about. `
`If he was kidnapped and we were threatened with a ransom of ten billion, I'd feel like sticking a bow on the guy and letting them have him." `
`"*giggle*giggle*..." `
`"On top of that, he's an idiot and reckless. `
`He talks about grand dreams and things that couldn't be done. `
`...I guess in that way, he's a super idiot worth the equivalent of ten billion normal idiots." `
`"But I'm sure that guy could do things that even a group of ten billion average people couldn't do. `
`Well, I'm pretty sure he'll fall flat on his face. `
`The world isn't easy." `
`"...But at the very least, `
`there's no doubt that watching over his life will be more fun than looking at ten billion average people." `
`Eva clicked her tongue at that clever style of speech, which would probably match Kinzo's tastes. `
`Apparently, Rudolf had done that on purpose, so he grinned back at her. `
`"...What of Maria?" `
`"...M-Maria is my adorable and only daughter. `
`Her value cannot be measured with money. `
`...That is all." `
`"Hmm. `
`......I see. `
`Dreams and the future, miracles and possibilities are the source of my magical power. `
`No magic without hopes holds any strength." `
`"...Heh, I cannot expect any more from you who have proven to be average, `
`but I see, my grandchildren hold future possibilities, and expecting a magical miracle from them may be worthwhile." `
`"If you're saying that, in this way, they are worth more than ten billion...hmm, yes, I can see where you're coming from. `
`...Hmmm, hmmmm..." `
`When Kinzo got in a rage, he wouldn't let anyone speak up, `
`but even so, he would sometimes accept something on his own while yelling by himself...and change his own opinion. `
`...That's what this felt like to the siblings. `
`Apparently, even though Kinzo had been disgusted by his unsuccessful children and had cast them away as being unfit for the inheritance of his title or his fortune, `
`he wasn't sure about his grandchildren. `
`...At this rate, he might soon say that the inheritance would go to his grandchildren instead of the siblings. `
`As the siblings sat in fear of what their fickle and short-tempered father might suddenly think of next, `
`they carefully watched his every move... `
`"...Hmm. `
`...Let me change my thinking a little. `
`I have absolutely no desire to hand over all I have to any of you." `
`"However, it will be quite interesting to question the grandchildren to see if one of them is qualified... `
`I've always thought of them as mere kids, `
`but there's a chance I'll find a shining gem amongst them that will catch me off guard." `
`"And testing them for that would be... `
`...yes, it would be a shame to abandon that final side-trip in my remaining life. `
`...Hmmmmm, `
`...well then, what shall I do...?" `
`"...I-I can, with confidence, recommend George as someone fitting to follow after you!" `
`Eva claimed that right away. `
`Natsuhi looked like she was about to follow along, but Krauss gave her a look telling her to restrain herself, so she swallowed her words. `
`"Hehheheheheheh! `
`How bold. `
`...Then, let us do this. `
`I will individually question the grandchildren to see if they are qualified to succeed the Ushiromiya family inheritance and wealth." `
`"...Father..." `
`"Howeeever!! `
`.........I do not mean by this that one of you will receive the headship indirectly. `
`I have already lost hope in every one of you." `
`"I have nothing to give you now. `
`Nothing! `
`The ones I will question are the grandchildren. `
`And the ones who might succeed me are the grandchildren. `
`......Make absolutely sure that you do not mistake this, are we clear......?" `
`"......I shall obey Father's decision." `
`"Same here. `
`I'll go along with what he decides. `
`...What about you, Aneki?" `
`"O-Of course. `
`...I believe Father will make a wise judgement." `
`"I-I will also obey Father's decision..." `
`"I shall think of how to test my grandchildren. `
`Which means this is no longer any business of yours. `
`After all, none of you are involved with the succession in any way now. `
`...So right here, right now, perhaps we should discuss a different matter that does involve you." `
`"A different matter...?" `
`"Indeed. `
`That is tonight's true purpose, and the true purpose for this final Ushiromiya family conference as well. `
`...Heheheheheheh!! `
`I have no desire to hear your thoughts and opinions. `
`I demand only your assistance! `
`Assistance in my ceremony!" `
`"...Your ceremony...?" `
`"Quiet...! `
`Father's talking now...!" `
`Rudolf and the rest had automatically narrowed their brows at the occult-like word. `
`Could he be planning to start some strange ceremony involving {f:5:Beatrice}'s resurrection again...? `
`And he wanted their assistance...? `
`What in the world was he planning to do? `
`In the past, he had carried out many eccentricities that he called by the same name, such as starting to burn a strange incense and filling the whole mansion with the stench. `
`To the siblings, a ceremony was nothing more than one of the aged Kinzo's obnoxious hobbies. `
`"Father, `
`just what do you mean by that......?" `
`"If we can assist you, we'll do anything. `
`Right, Rosa?" `
`"Y-Yes... `
`But...what in the world...is it...?" `
`"A ceremony as inscribed in my epitaph. `
`...A ceremony to revive {f:5:Beatrice} and open the door to the Golden Land. `
`That witch, who escaped her cage of flesh and sneeringly slipped through my fingers, I shall now capture... `
`and force into submission with my greatest hidden art. `
`......For that purpose, I must offer 13 people as sacrifices." `
`"...Hehheheheheh! `
`Gathering 13 people's worth of sacrifices is no easy feat. `
`But tonight is the family conference! `
`Many adults have gathered on Rokkenjima. `
`There could be no other day on which to carry out this ceremony." `
`Taken literally, it sounded like he was telling them to become human sacrifices for his dark ceremony and die. `
`Ridiculous. `
`Was it some kind of metaphor...? `
`But they didn't even have a clue what he was trying to illustrate. `
`The siblings whispered together about what Kinzo was saying... `
`"...What's Dad going on about? `
`Is this his usual sickness...?" `
`"Probably. `
`Listen silently for now." `
`"........." `
`"I'm sorry, Father... `
`I don't understand what you mean by that." `
`"What is it you don't understand? `
`I am making this extremely simple. `
`I told you that I'll choose 13 of the humans on this island and offer them as sacrifices in a ceremony to revive {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`Even worthless people like you can be very useful as sacrifices in my ceremony. `
`Wahhahhahhahha!!" `
`"...Listen!! `
`This is not a joke nor anything of the sort. `
`This is my final bet, my final ceremony, the last one I will desire in my life! `
`There are now more than 13 humans on this island. `
`In short, that's a head count that can easily satisfy the massive number of sacrifices I require! `
`Become the sacrifices for my ceremony!!" `
`"...Kinzo-san, ...you weren't... `
`serious about what you said back then, were you...?! `
`It wasn't a joke...?!!" `
`Unusually for him, Nanjo's face changed color as he stood up and shouted. `
`It seemed this wasn't the first time Nanjo had heard all this dark talk about 13 sacrifices. `
`"Sorry, my friend. `
`That was no joke nor anything of the sort. `
`It is what I bet my life on, the final ceremony, the final game that I will attempt." `
`"Yes, this is a game! `
`If gaining my fortune and leaving the island is your goal, then there are only two ways to achieve it! `
`Will you escape being chosen as one of the 13 sacrifices and spectacularly survive, by finally solving the riddle of the epitaph and stopping the ceremony, `
`...or will you kill me?! `
`...And thereby stop this ceremony. `
`Those are your only two options!!" `
`By now, everyone wasn't just whispering, but chattering and muttering away. `
`Even the siblings had noticed that Kinzo was beginning to act abnormally... `
`"...Father, are you a little tired? `
`Genji-san, has Father been drinking?" `
`"......No. `
`The Master is sensible." `
`"Sorry, Dad. `
`I don't have a clue what you're talking about... `
`Dad's free to start up any weird ceremony he wants to revive the witch he loves. `
`That's his hobby. `
`But getting wrapped up in that...ahaha...and being made into a human sacrifice is a little more than I can handle." `
`"Rudolf, are you trying to interrupt Father?!" `
`"What are you talking about, Aneki?! `
`You expect me to listen to something that shady and say "Oh, really?"?!" `
`Was the "ceremony" Kinzo had mentioned literally something disturbing, `
`or was it some kind of test to choose the Successor? `
`It seemed that Rudolf had taken it literally, `
`but Eva apparently still believed that it was something like a test or examination `
`to find a proper Successor. `
`But Kinzo responded with a clear smile. `
`"Well then, that is all I have to say. `
`Nooo objections or opinions are necessary from you...!! `
`I will simply awaken from my dream of having four unsuccessful children. `
`To all of you, what will occur now before your very eyes may seem like a dream, an illusion, something that couldn't conceivably be of this world, and a world that defies understanding." `
`"But that itself is my reality!! `
`Now, I will finally awaken from the shallow, useless dream that all of you are!!" `
`"Come, the game has already begun, see? `
`With this many of you here, I can take lives starting with anyone...!! `
`So long, my unsuccessful children. `
`And for the final and only time in your lives, be useful...for my ceremony...!! `
`Arise, Pendragon's Memorial Troops...!!" `
`When Kinzo raised his arms high like an opera singer and yelled as though towards a packed audience, `
`the air shattered like glass, ......and the outlines of three people who supposedly hadn't been invited to this island appeared... `
`"Chiester {ruby:forty‐five:45}, right here...!" `
`"Chiester {ruby:four‐one‐zero:410}, right heere!" `
`"Chiester {ruby:double‐oh:00}, right here, sir." `
`Three girls with strange forms suddenly appeared behind Kinzo. `
`Where from? `
`When? `
`Who? `
`Who were they?? `
`...The Humans were thrown off balance, and their minds went blank. `
`Because they spent all that time thinking, they lost their last chance to survive. `
`"You have permission to shoot six to death. `
`I leave the choice of targets up to you. `
`Begin your attack." `
`"Unrestricted Firing, understood, sir. `
`Thank you for granting us such excellent targets. `
`Everyone, Commence Unrestricted Firing." `
`"Nihi! `
`First one in, nyeh!! `
`Hyahhah!!" `
`When 410 scratched the air with her finger, a golden bow appeared in empty space, and she pulled its string. `
`The golden arrow that had been readied there was fired off without any hesitation, flew around the room leaving haphazard gold curves everywhere, `
`......and chose Natsuhi from among those sitting at the table of the family conference, pulverizing the left half of her face. `
`Flesh and deep-red blood scattered around, `
`leaving massive red spatter marks on the relatives' faces and the pure white tablecloth. `
`...Silence fell. `
`Despite the massive number of deep-red spots left on the tablecloth, `
`......no one could understand why Natsuhi's head was half smashed, nor why she was hanging her head as though dozing while still sitting, `
`......and they watched on in silence. `
`...Those sitting on Natsuhi's right-hand side were silent for a relatively long time, `
`but those sitting to her left were not. `
`...Because the people sitting on that side had been shown how her head had been smashed open like a watermelon or a pomegranate... `
`and could even see inside her... `
`"Na...tsuhi......" `
`"...One down. `
`Natsuhi, is it? A luckless woman to the end. `
`...Next!" `
`"00, Firing." `
`After scratching the empty air in the same way and readying her bow, 00 fired as well. `
`After it flew around and around at high speeds like the golden arrow 410 had released, drawing a convoluted curve in the same manner, `
`...it smashed half of Rudolf's head in the same way as he looked at Natsuhi in shock, killing him instantly. `
`This time, everyone managed to avoid freezing up mentally. `
`They realized that a fearsome murder had started playing out right in front of them, just as Kinzo had said. `
`And they realized that Kinzo would probably kill even more...! `
`""Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!"" `
`""Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!"" `
`Shrill screams burst out. `
`Even so, they didn't know what to do. `
`So they could only keep screaming and flapping their wide-open mouths like goldfish... `
`"...F-Father, `
`...what do you think you're doing...?" `
`"...Y-You fool!! `
`Run now!!" `
`As Eva asked Kinzo that in total shock, `
`Hideyoshi, who had come to his senses faster than anyone else and risen to his feet, pulled at her arm from behind. `
`However, merciless fate's choice for the third sacrifice... `
`...was Hideyoshi. `
`Just like the two before him, half of Hideyoshi's head was neatly smashed, `
`...and the right side of his head, which had happened to be facing that direction at the time, ...had been blown away with its contents exposed like a watermelon or a pomegranate. `
`So, still holding Eva, ...Hideyoshi slumped backwards and fell down. `
`Still held by her beloved husband, Eva fell over backwards with him. `
`"Dear...? `
`Dear...?! `
`Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekkkk!!!" `
`Eva screamed. `
`...It was only natural. `
`The face she had been looking for...had been half lost, `
`and the crushed skull, the mashed brains, and the crushed jaw all lay bare... `
`"45, Impact, it's a hit...!" `
`"Spectacular. `
`Fire again. `
`Three more remain." `
`"F-Father...!! `
`Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What...what...is this supposed to be?!?!" `
`When Krauss stood up forcefully and was about to rush Kinzo, 00 blocked him. `
`...With her slender-looking body, she held back Krauss with just the palm of her right hand. `
`He still tried to resist and attack Kinzo, `
`so 00 lifted Krauss by the nape of the neck and twisted into his Adam's apple with her thumb. `
`It seemed to be very painful, and Krauss was overcome with agony. `
`"Gghh, oooooooohhhh...!!! `
`Everyone, ...run...!! `
`Get the police...! `
`An ambulance...!! `
`Quickly...!!" `
`"Everyone, let's escape!! `
`Escape!!" `
`Nanjo's sharp words finally dissolved the spell that had been holding them down in their chairs. `
`When Gohda and Kumasawa each tried to escape from the dining hall first, `
`410 moved in an instant and appeared there, blocking the way. `
`"Nihi! You sure are slow nyeeh. `
`Did you think I'd let you escape nyeeh{p:0:♪}" `
`"Hiieeeeeeeeeehhhh!!" `
`"H-Help meeeeeeeeeeeee!!" `
`"Gohda-san, duck!!" `
`Even though Gohda didn't understand, he crouched when he heard Kyrie's sharp voice. `
`...Then, a burst of air rushed above his head. `
`Kyrie had taken a big swing with a chair to mow 410 down. `
`But 410, still with a mocking expression, easily caught that widely swung chair with a single hand. `
`"...Tch!" `
`"What a scary woman nyeh. `
`You really wanna go the same way as your husband that muuch?" `
`From the cuff of her arm where she had caught the chair, something like a shining golden snake appeared, `
`...wrapped itself around the chair, and burst open. `
`It was a fearsome power, like a vice. `
`When Kyrie realized that the being in front of her, which looked like a girl, `
`was actually something that surpassed Human knowledge and that a Human could not even begin to oppose, `
`her head was filled with a fierce alarm bell that welled up from deep inside her... `
`Genji, Shannon, and Kanon, all of the servants permitted to wear the One-Winged Eagle, continued to stand calmly at attention by the wall, even with a scene like this before their eyes, `
`making them look very bizarre and eerie. `
`For an instant, Kyrie thought that they'd managed to stay calm because they were with the enemy... `
`and had been given a guarantee that they wouldn't be killed. `
`...But as soon as she thought that, the side of Genji's face was blown away before her eyes. `
`"G-Genji-san..." `
`"45, Impact, it's a hit...!" `
`"...Hohoh, Genji, how unfortunate. `
`...Rest in peace, my friend. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle* Your death will not be wasted. `
`You will become one of the 13 keys essential to the resurrection of my beloved witch. `
`Fuhhahahahahahahaha..." `
`The half of Genji's expression that remained... `
`was as indifferent as ever. `
`He tilted, ...fell over, and sent a blood-red splatter out across the floor... `
`"......Genji-sama........." `
`"......We're nothing more...than the witch's pieces. `
`......Nothing more, ......nothing more..." `
`From the meek and frustrated... `
`no, ...resigned expressions on Shannon and Kanon's faces, one couldn't sense any naive hopes that they'd be rescued. `
`That's right. `
`Kinzo was, in the truest sense, ......carrying out these murders at random. `
`In the truest sense, ...he was killing like it was a game to see who would be saved and who would be killed. `
`"Weeell then, whoo'll we go for next nyeh? `
`Nihhihi!!" `
`410 looked at Kyrie for a second. `
`In that second, ...Kyrie was prepared for her own death. `
`But when she readied her golden bow in midair, 410 was looking at someone else over Kyrie's shoulder. `
`...So, as imprudent as it was, Kyrie felt as though she had been saved... `
`Again, an ugly, exploding, popping sound rang throughout the room. `
`...Who was it this time? `
`When Kyrie turned to face the direction of the sound, `
`......she saw blood gushing like a fountain, and Eva lying on her husband's chest. `
`...Of course, her face had been half smashed just like her husband's... `
`410 had mercilessly targeted Eva as she'd clung to her husband's corpse, sobbing. `
`"L-Let go of Nii-san...!! `
`Let go of Nii-san...!! `
`Just stop it, Father!! `
`Just stop this brutality!!" `
`"...Run away, Rosa... `
`Ggh, ack......!" `
`Rosa's objection didn't reach Kinzo as he continued to laugh loudly in the blood-spattered dining hall, `
`and she wasn't able to lessen Krauss's pain at being lifted up by the nape of the neck by 00. `
`So, Rosa had no choice but to use force. `
`She lifted up a chair beside her and gave a warning. `
`"Father...!! `
`Order her to let go of Nii-san! `
`Just stop them from doing this!!" `
`"I cannot. `
`If that is what you desire, then prevent it using your own power. `
`...Cut a path through to your own fate with your own hands. `
`You who have always hid behind the backs of others in fear, let me see you overcome your weakness one last time in your life...!! `
`Fuhhahahahahahahahaha!!!" `
`"...F-Father... `
`......Aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!" `
`The chair that Rosa had lifted up... `
`...swung down at the father who had reigned as a symbol of terror for her entire life. `
`It was the greatest...and final...act of bravery and self-control in Rosa's life. `
`What Kinzo had said might have been true. `
`...If she had grasped that courage much sooner, `
`her life might have become more free, unrestrained by anyone else. `
`Then, there was a bursting sound. `
`The sound of Rosa's chair fiercely hitting Kinzo... `
`could not have been this. `
`With the chair still lifted up, `
`......she neatly lost half of her head...and slumped over. `
`Still holding Krauss up with one hand, ...00 had stuck her other hand out towards Rosa. `
`The golden snake released from that arm... `
`had constricted Rosa in a helix... `
`and had smashed into her head. `
`"...Defensive Firing. `
`I apologize for the discourtesy of shooting so close to you, sir." `
`"I care not. `
`Hmm, so this makes six people." `
`"Yes, Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}. `
`This makes six people." `
`When she indifferently communicated that, 00 let go of Krauss, whom she had been lifting up this whole time. `
`"Indeed. `
`So, the sacrifices of the first twilight were Eva, Rudolf, Rosa, Natsuhi, Hideyoshi, and Genji. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!" `
`It was a massacre that happened in an instant. `
`The interior of the dining hall had been dirtied by blood spatter, `
`...and the six unlucky victims lay with their heads brutally exposed. `
`In a way that was fitting for that abnormal space, Kinzo's abnormal laugh alone echoed out... `
`"Hahhahahahahaha, wahhahahahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`The curtain has finally risen! `
`The ceremony to revive {f:5:Beatrice} has begun...!!" `
`"You lucky ones who have managed to escape the first twilight, allow me to introduce you to my friends. `
`Arise, my friend! `
`Ronove...!!" `
`When Kinzo called Ronove's name, the demon butler showed himself in midair, bowing respectfully... `
`"Pleased to meet you, everyone. `
`And good day to those of you I haven't seen for a long time. `
`Pu ku ku ku...! `
`It seems this place is once again spectacularly untidy." `
`"Pay it no mind. `
`It takes a stimulant of this level to wake me from my daydream-like days." `
`"Allow me to introduce my friend, a reliable butler and one of the 72 Great Demons, Ronove." `
`"I am pleased to make your acquaintance." `
`Just who was he making that introduction to? `
`...Krauss and Kyrie, who were still down on their backsides, and Nanjo, Gohda and Kumasawa... `
`could only look up at this middle-aged gentlemen they didn't know in shock... `
`Only Shannon and Kanon seemed to recognize him, and they bowed deeply... `
`"...So, I wasn't able to greet Genji. `
`I hope he was at least able to fulfill his purpose painlessly." `
`"It was an instant death from a direct hit to the head...! `
`He didn't have time to feel the pain." `
`"Is that so? `
`Very well." `
`"Allow me to introduce another friend. `
`Arise, my friend, {f:5:Virgilia}...!!" `
`Once again, a silhouette of someone the relatives didn't know appeared from empty space. `
`She appeared in a refined dress while making an elegant greeting. `
`"......Thank you for summoning me, Master. `
`Although I would rather not have been summoned into a bloody place such as this." `
`"Allow me to introduce her too. `
`This is both my friend and a reliable counselor, {f:5:Virgilia}. `
`...I desire to borrow your great power as the Witch of the Finite. `
`Lend it to me!" `
`"...Even if I tried to refuse, such a thing wouldn't be permitted for one subordinated by the power of your summonings. `
`As you wish, Master." `
`"......Still, what a fearsome fellow. `
`To think he summoned three of the Chiester Sisters Corps, then me, and even {f:5:Virgilia}... `
`...Even though it's only in the area of summoning, to think that he surpasses Milady so thoroughly... How frightening. `
`I can't help but shudder at the Ushiromiya blood." `
`"In order to carry out {f:5:Beatrice}'s resurrection ceremony, I shall give it my all as a summoner. `
`This still isn't enough. `
`In order to perfectly succeed in the ceremony this time, I shall summon more." `
`"The Pendragon Memorial Troops and Ronove and {f:5:Virgilia}... `
`...I can still call more... With my magical power, I can still call many more...!! `
`"Answer to my summons...... `
`...one of the 72 demons, Gaap!!" `
`"Gaap...? `
`You can even materialize her...?" `
`"It probably means that the corrosion has advanced even more on this island. `
`...It had already proceeded far enough to materialize us. `
`By now, we shouldn't be surprised no matter how great a demon he summons." `
`"Has Rokkenjima already been completely sucked into a parallel world then? `
`......I hope he does not surrender." `
`"......He learned a lot last time, correct? `
`After all this time, he won't surrender over this much. `
`Probably, I should say. `
`Pu ku ku! `
`......Well then, shall we enjoy the stage we now stand upon? `
`It seems the main character is the Master this time. `
`Let us expect a script of a different flavor than Milady's." `
`When Kinzo strongly concentrated his magical power, ...a pale light gathered in the empty air, twisted, `
`...and a magic circle was drawn there with a deep-red glow. `
`And with a sound like glass breaking, ......a new demon could be seen there. `
`"...You did well to answer to my call. `
`...Gaap, one of the 72 Great Demons...!" `
`"......This is one hell of a place you've summoned me to. `
`Did you call me to clean up this blood-stained room, `
`{f:5:Goldsmith}...?" `
`The literally devilish woman, wrapped in a venomous, ominous costume, `
`looked at the scene which should have made her cover her eyes, and twisted her mouth in a grin... `
`"To summon you for such a reason... `
`would be like using a cashmere muffler to mop the floor." `
`"It's been a long time, Gaap. `
`...To think that a Great Demon such as yourself has finally appeared on this island. `
`...Perhaps this island is finally submerging completely into fantasy." `
`"This all-star cast is even more surprising than the gruesome state of the room. `
`......A full three Chiester Sisters, the Great Demon Ronove, the Great Witch {f:5:Virgilia}, and even me." `
`"What's going on? `
`Is this Pandemonium? `
`Are you trying to start a concert from hell or something? `
`......I see, as a conductor for that, I couldn't think of anyone better than you, {f:5:Goldsmith}." `
`"I will have your assistance as facilitator in the completion of my ceremony to resurrect {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`You have no objections to my summoning contract, correct...?" `
`"Of course not. `
`There's no way I could resist the subordinating power of the legendary Great Summoner, Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}, who forced the famous Great Witch {f:5:Beatrice} to do his bidding." `
`"...I'll assist you. `
`Although I will of course ask a fitting price. `
`...So? `
`What's my first job?" `
`"Capture the cowards who made it through the first twilight. `
`Fortunately, there are still seven here, aren't there? `
`Nanjo, Shannon, Kanon, Gohda, Kumasawa, Kyrie, and Krauss...!" `
`"Hoh, if these seven are all offered as sacrifices, that's exactly 13 people! `
`Until it's time for the second and later twilights to be carried out, throw them into the cage of sacrifices, *cackle*!!" `
`"......A cashmere mop, huh? `
`Understood." `
`As Gaap shrugged her shoulders, she looked at Krauss, who was still down on his butt. `
`She glared. `
`Then, when she snapped her fingers, ...Krauss was swallowed up by the floor, as though a round pitfall had opened up beneath him. `
`"Uu, waaaaahhh......" `
`"One down." `
`There was no hole in the floor. `
`But it had certainly looked as though Krauss had been swallowed up by a hole and disappeared... `
`"......!!" `
`Searching for her next prey, Gaap's gaze crossed Kyrie's. `
`She snapped her fingers. `
`Kyrie jumped back as though repelled. `
`Her instincts had been right. `
`After all, in the place where she'd been until a second ago, a round, jet-black hole had appeared, the same kind that had swallowed up Krauss. `
`However, before she could catch her balance, another pitfall appeared and swallowed her up. `
`...Even Kyrie had no way of eluding Gaap's capture. `
`"Waahh...!!" `
`When she snapped her fingers again, a shocked Nanjo was swallowed up by the floor and disappeared. `
`When she did it again, `
`410 let out a short yell and jumped back. `
`This time, a slightly larger pitfall had opened, swallowing both Shannon and Kanon, who had been standing in a line by the door. `
`But because 410 had jumped away from the door, the way was no longer blocked. `
`Instinctively aware that he would be next, Gohda dashed out through that door. `
`Of course, Kumasawa also escaped with lightning speed, chasing after Gohda. `
`As Gaap snapped her fingers over and over, `
`round, jet-black pitfalls opened one after another behind them, chasing them. `
`However, they did nothing but drive the recklessly fleeing pair away...and couldn't swallow them up. `
`Gohda and Kumasawa had escaped in a matter of seconds... `
`"......I've gotten slow. `
`I let two get away." `
`"Don't worry, we are currently locking onto the escapee targets." `
`"Data Link ready. `
`Nihi! `
`Shall we snipe?" `
`"No, I cannot authorize that. `
`They are precious sacrifices. `
`Wait for the Master's authorization." `
`"Great Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}...! `
`We await your orders...!" `
`"It is still too soon for the coming of the second twilight...is what the source of my magical power is whispering to me. `
`It must not be now. `
`Let them do as they please. `
`It isn't as though they can escape from this island." `
`"The source of the Master's magical power is noise and risk and tests of luck. `
`...Hohohoh, in other words, it means being fickle, it would seem." `
`"*cackle* Perhaps you could also put it that way. `
`Good work, Gaap. `
`Let us steadily advance the ceremony from here on." `
`"......Well then, that is that. `
`Next are my grandchildren. `
`......I will test them to see whether they are qualified to become my successor. `
`Let's see, how shall I test their qualifications? `
`*cackle*cackle*...!!" `
`"If you decide that they're qualified, `
`...do you intend to abandon Beato's resurrection?" `
`"Of course. `
`And despite that, I will test them. `
`...Hmph, perhaps a woman cannot understand that contradiction, nor my madness. `
`*cackle*cackle*..." `
`"......Well apparently, men are as weird as ever. `
`I don't get the very concept of playing around with risk." `
`"Oh my, and I thought you loved that sort of thing." `
`"Of course. `
`If a man whispers to me about dangerous risks and love, I go head over heels. `
`...But only if he's hot!" `
`"Pu ku ku ku ku ku...!" `
`"Be quiet. `
`Try to refrain from whispering." `
`"Hmph, truly noisy women. `
`But at least they aren't boring. `
`...This is what makes summoning so pleasant. `
`All of you will bear one side of the scales of noise and risk in my ceremony. `
`That is the work I expect of you...!" `
`Six brutally murdered corpses lay in the dining hall, and it was contaminated with red, gruesome decorations... `
`It was now unimaginable that, until just a second ago, 13 humans had been arranged here in a well-organized manner. `
`Kinzo lined up the famous demons and their subordinates, loudly declared the beginning of a night of overwhelming mass murders, `
`and swore to himself that he would certainly revive {f:5:Beatrice} and open the door to the Golden Land... `
`"Sorry to keep you waiting!! `
`Now the curtain finally rises on the first twilight!! `
`*cackle*! `
`That Kinzo, I see he loves being flashy as usual. `
`So, even that man who can be more persistent than anything when he follows you around...can shine so when on the stage." `
`"Damn... `
`Always killing in a grotesque way, as usual... `
`Smashing half of their heads?! `
`The bad taste you witches and demons have always pisses me off...!" `
`"Smashing half of their heads... I see. `
`So, she's realized that, in the games up until now, that's been the most ideal method of killing." `
`"Ideal? `
`How is such a grotesque way of killing ideal?!" `
`"...Isn't it though? `
`Try and remember the very first game." `
`"You...! `
`So, you're that new demon or whatever that just appeared... `
`Damn, so does this mean that the witch's corrosion continued, and there are now even more creeps wandering around...?!" `
`...The more the witch's corrosion advances, the more Rokkenjima tilts towards the spirit world. `
`That's why strange, insane people keep appearing one by one. `
`This island has been closed off by the typhoon, so no Human can leave it, much less appear as a new character to increase their numbers. `
`But the more the corrosion advances, the more witches and demons can appear, without limit. `
`Increasing one by one. `
`By now, there might be more demons than Humans among the characters appearing in this insane tale. `
`...Their numbers might be the thing that represents this mad corrosion. `
`Yeah, I'm sure that's true. `
`And the corrosion hasn't just affected the number of people, but apparently their fashion sense as well. `
`If the corrosion advances any further and even more weird people appear, just what in the world will they be wearing? `
`......It's so scary I can't imagine... `
`...Aaaah, seriously, give me a break... `
`Don't make these weird guys increase in number anymore...!! `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*! I can't do that, they'll keep increasing more and more!! `
`I'll defile the foolish "closed circle" rule Humans speak of, over and over again...! `
`Welcome to my elegant game, `
`Gaap!" `
`"......It's been a long time, Riiche. `
`Have you been well? `
`...Why do I ask, you look great! `
`Have you gotten younger? `
`You look two or three hundred years younger than when I last saw you. `
`......Ah, I see." `
`The demon Grandfather had summoned and introduced as Gaap... `
`took a glance at me, and then grinned as though she'd figured something out on her own. `
`...That smile felt openly obscene. `
`"I guess she's Beato's friend. `
`...Which means she's gotta be a creep among creeps. `
`By the way, they were saying something about a closed circle or whatever, but what does that mean?" `
`"Serial murder mystery novels that occur in places isolated from the outside world, like Rokkenjima is now, are sometimes called closed circles. `
`Since such a place is isolated from the outside, it's like a circle that's closed. `
`...Therefore, in general, the characters and suspects are limited in number." `
`"Having new suspect candidates added on one after another from outside the circle goes against the etiquette of mystery novels. `
`...In other words, the witch is probably trying to desecrate Humans and the mystery genre itself." `
`"......You're Gretel? `
`I see, you look like a wise kid. ...*giggle* `
`I love kids like you. `
`...You taste so sweet and tantalizing." `
`"Gross. `
`...Keep the jokes to your clothing." `
`"It's Devilish Pretty's newest, "Jack the Ripper: Christmas Blood". `
`Sorry for having a style that a country bumpkin from the Human world couldn't understand, okay?" `
`"...At least we know it's well-ventilated. `
`Why don't you add a gap to the head part as well? `
`Let a little air into your brain." `
`"Gaap is always sensitive to the fashions of the spirit world! `
`But this year's fad truly is bold. `
`I think I'll order one sometime...!" `
`"For you, Riiche, I'd recommend Ali-Gray, <Alice and the Graveyard>. `
`Let's go to 666 sometime soon to look at the clothes. `
`You really should drop by the spirit world every now and then." `
`"When this game is over, I'll be sure to do that. `
`*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"......Still, your two opponents are pretty cute, Riiche." `
`"It looks like this kid has figured out the meaning of the corpses with their heads half smashed. `
`......Know what that is, girl...?" `
`"...Just now, she told me to remember the first game. `
`...What did that mean...?" `
`"Just what it sounds like. `
`...Remember the first twilight of the very first game. `
`...When the adults' corpses were found in the gardening shed with the magic circle drawn on it. `
`Remember?" `
`Episode 1. `
`The first twilight. `
`Krauss, Rudolf, Kyrie, Rosa, Shannon, and Gohda... All six of them had their heads pulverized and died...... `
`"At that time, there were two types of corpses. `
`Some had their faces pulverized, and some had half of their faces pulverized." `
`"That's right. `
`The ones with their faces smashed were Rudolf, Kyrie, Rosa, and Gohda. `
`The ones with the sides of their heads smashed were Krauss and Shannon. `
`...At the time, I fickly created two types of corpses, `
`but I realized that the former, more atrocious type was actually disadvantageous for me." `
`"...Disadvantageous for you...? `
`......I see. `
`So that's what this is." `
`That's right. `
`The smashed faces might look atrocious. `
`...But that made it hard to confirm the identity of each person. `
`For example, at that time, Uncle Krauss and Shannon-chan had their heads half smashed. `
`That alone was atrocious enough, but because half of their faces remained, it was easy to confirm their identities. `
`But Dad and the other three were different. `
`Because his face had been completely destroyed, even I, as his son, could only guess by inference that it had to be Dad because of his clothes and the like. `
`...In short, it remained vague until the end whether that really had been Dad's corpse. `
`"If this reasoning battle had taken place during the first game as well, `
`I would probably have claimed that, since the identities of Dad and the rests' bodies were impossible to confirm, there was a possibility that one was a fake corpse. `
`...After all, Beato didn't state anything in red during that game." `
`"Well done. Correct. `
`......A faked death is one of the basics of the mystery genre. `
`Even if you make a doctor examine the corpse, you can't trust the results if you suspect him of being the culprit's accomplice. `
`Therefore, corpses that can't guarantee a death for certain are always disadvantageous for the witch's side." `
`"You can suspect faked deaths for all corpses, hypothesizing that one or more of them is the culprit for the crimes that follow. `
`...It's a move Battler doesn't like, but it's the most elementary move to use against a witch." `
`"Yeah, that's right. `
`That's why Beato started using the red. `
`...With the red truth, she can carry out a perfect autopsy." `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`That's how it is. `
`Normally, for the first twilight, `
`I would use the red truth right away, confirming the deaths of these six. `
`However, as you know, my battle strategy this time is the complete opposite of previous games, and I'll now use red truth starvation tactics...!" `
`"Since you use it as a grounding from which to counterattack, I will not use the red easily. `
`I'll make you come apart at the seams by using red in just a single place, as rarely as possible! `
`In the end, it means I will permit all rants regarding your guesswork for all the closed rooms, `
`and I only have to smash one of those once with the red truth." `
`"Ihihi! `
`Even though you've always teased me, once I start counterattacking, you now hole up back inside your shell. `
`Quit kidding around." `
`"At any rate, I do not want to use the red, I want to be stingy! `
`I want to bully Battleeer!! `
`But how could I guarantee a death for certain without using red? `
`I worried and worried over it. `
`...Then, Gaap gave me an idea! `
`It truly is a simple method. `
`*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"...I just pointed out something obvious and you hit upon the idea, Riiche. `
`I simply said that you only had to create corpses whose identity could be distinguished and whose complete death would be understood." `
`"Kuhhihihihi! `
`In short, I put those two things together! `
`The face, which is necessary to distinguish their identity, and the pulverization of the head, the vessel for the soul, which is the perfect symbol of death! `
`When I put those two parts neatly together, aah, wonderful! `
`I came up with the perfect answer of corpses with their heads half-smashed!" `
`"I'll bet you love two-colored bread and two-colored ice cream. `
`You're just like a greedy kid..." `
`"......At any rate, `
`even if half of their heads are smashed, we shouldn't assume that they're dead at this point in time." `
`"I get it. `
`...Since Beato is trying to act tough and is refusing to say anything in red, we've gotta suspect everything. `
`...Of course, I'm definitely not gonna swallow the theory of magical mass murder by the Chiester ass nee-chans." `
`"*giggle* `
`You sure have gotten prudent. `
`...If this were the first game, you would've swallowed everything." `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`I wouldn't have anything less from a rival. `
`Since there is fortunately no red now, he can imagine whatever he wants and reason over and over again as he likes. `
`At the very end, at the very sweetest spot, I'll cut him down at once with the red truth...!" `
