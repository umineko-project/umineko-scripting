`"Good morning, Milady. `
`My, my, you do appear to be in a good mood. `
`What a pleasant awakening you seem to have had." `
`"What do you mean, pleasant awakening...?! `
`I was so excited, I couldn't sleep a wink. `
`After all, the curtain is rising on the fun, fun fourth game...!" `
`It seemed that she truly had been so excited that she hadn't gotten any sleep. `
`Did she show absolutely no signs of lacking sleep because she was young, or because she had the mind of a little kid? `
`Ronove chose not to say that aloud, and laughed "pu ku ku" instead. `
`"I really ran that Battler into the ground last time! `
`Ah, the look on his face when he was like "You tricked me"! `
`That was so patheeetic! `
`Even so, is that guy still feeling down?" `
`"Feeling down, you say...?" `
`"Hmm, well, that's right. `
`...That man's a bit too trusting for his age, isn't he?" `
`"Indeed. `
`Although you could call that his charm. `
`Pu ku ku..." `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*! `
`Ain't it the truth, ain't it the truth? `
`Well, speaking of which. `
`Didn't he totally fall for that one last time?" `
`"Yes, totally and splendidly. `
`...You violated the purity of one never deceived since the time of his birth, as well as his rosebud-like innocence, all to your heart's content. `
`......Even the joy of dashing across a field covered with beautiful new snow on a winter morning and trampling it completely wouldn't even begin to compare." `
`"Didn't you take Battler-sama's innocent heart, `
`and quite thrillingly, splendidly, atrociously, mercilessly, and unculturedly go just a little too far...? `
`And you insulted him to the highest degree, enough to make one uneasy. `
`Most people would be crushed after something like that. `
`Pukukukuku, so much so that they wouldn't want to see your face ever again." `
`"I-I know that much...! `
`I also...umm...thought that if he was too disheartened to join us at the table, `
`even though the fourth game is finally starting, that would be such a pain, `
`so I came to you, thinking that it'd be better to prepare a counter-measure for that case beforehand...!" `
`"Hmmmm... `
`In that case, perhaps it really would be best to prepare such a counter-measure. `
`I am sad to say that your "North Wind and the Sun Strategy" gave Battler-sama quite a shock." `
`"H-Hoh... `
`...A shock, you say? How bad of one...?" `
`Beato lowered her voice slightly, asking timidly. `
`Ronove followed suit...and lowered his voice in the same way. `
`"...In truth, he has been crouching and clutching at his knees for some time now. `
`I spoke to him several times, but he did not answer. `
`I also brought him some food, but he never even touched it." `
`"...Th-That is...troublesome... `
`Is he really feeling that down...?" `
`"Pukukukuku. `
`It is only natural. `
`...After all, you `
`{nobreak:tho `
`rough `
`ly} `
`destroyed him, Milady. `
`That would turn most anyone into a misanthrope." `
`"Hoh, distrust of Humans? How convenient! `
`Let him give up on Humans and trust witches, wahahaha... `
`......O-Oh, `
`*cough*. `
`Sorry, I shouldn't fool around too much." `
`Beato had tried to joke about it, but the situation seemed to be quite serious, so that even she took the hint and hid her laughter. `
`"...Is it really that serious...? `
`Sh-Should we wait just a little longer before beginning the fourth game...?" `
`"Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}'s guest will be arriving, `
`so it may be best to open the fourth game quickly. `
`However, perhaps you ought to show a little concern for Battler's feelings, Milady." `
`"Concern! `
`Show concern, you say?! `
`How should I do that...?! `
`He is feeling down, so... `
`th-that's right, shall I cheer him up?!" `
`"When a person's heart is dark and closed off, interacting with them in a dark manner gains you nothing. `
`Your only option is to shine with a brightness stronger than the dark." `
`"Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiit, quit messing arooooooooouund...!!!" `
`"Kya-hhahaha!! `
`Battler-kuuun, over heeere! `
`A croissant baked by Ronove-sama would be wasted on the likes of yooou! `
`Why don't I enjoy it myself?" `
`Battler's stomach involuntarily growled at the fragrant smell of the croissant. `
`His breakfast plate was empty, but Battler hadn't eaten any of it. `
`...The biggest glutton of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, `
`Beelzebub, had waited for Ronove to leave, and had then come to snatch the food away. `
`Battler had noticed, and they'd been really noisy ever since. `
`Even though Beelzebub only had to give it back immediately or else throw it into her own mouth right away, `
`she intentionally ran around in circles, making fun of Battler. `
`"Give my breakfast back, dammiiiit!! `
`If you give it back now, I'll let you off with a single flick to the forehead. `
`But just you try eating it!!" `
`"What, are you gonna eat me up insteeead?! `
`Kyaha! `
`If you think you can, just try it! I'll bet I'll be as sweet as honey pancakes. `
`...kya!" `
`"Gotcha!! `
`Right now, I want to eat that bread even more than your thighs. `
`Be a good girl and give it heeeeeeeeere, `
`fugagigigigi...!! `
`So, you resist until the eeeeeeeeeend...!!" `
`"Ugugugugu!! `
`No way, no way, I won't give it to yooou!! `
`Even the croissant wants me to eat iiit!!!" `
`"Y-Yaay, yahooooooooo, g'moooooorning, Battleeeer!! `
`Are you still moping so early in the morniiing?!?! `
`It's the beginning of a new day, and a new game, so let's get our spirits uuuuuuuuuup!!" `
`...She flung the door open. `
`Like a marathon runner drawn on a certain caramel box, `
`with her hands held high and an idiotic cheeriness, `
`...Beato appeared. `
`For some reason, flags from around the world and confetti scattered about, perfectly completing this magnificent entrance. `
`...Battler and Beelzebub, who had been fighting over the croissant, completely forgot about their argument, speechless. `
`"K...Kyahahahaha! `
`Good morning, {f:5:Beatrice}-sama! `
`I'll just be on my way now! `
`Here, Battler-kun, say aaah!" `
`"Mggmffff!!" `
`Mmm mmm, *chomp*, ...*gulp*. `
`... `
`...H-Hey, morning, Beato... `
`...Glad to see you're cheery this morning." `
`............ `
`Beato and Battler looked at each other. `
`...It seemed neither had a clue what was going on with the other. `
`"B-Battleer...? `
`Wh‐wh‐what is this, Ronoveeeee, `
`he looks totally fine, doesn't heeeeeeeeeeeee?!! `
`He isn't clutching his knees! `
`And he's answering! `
`Wait a sec, he was even in the middle of eating!!" `
`"Pukukukukuku!! `
`No, no, he was sleeping like a baby in his futon, clutching his knees. `
`I informed him that it was time to wake up, but he just wouldn't rise. `
`I tried to feed him, but it seems that a naughty cat wandered in and prevented that. `
`Pu ku ku, pu ku ku ku ku!" `
`"G‐ `
`Gwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!! `
`You tricked meeeeeeeeeee...!!" `
`"Tch, you should talk. `
`Weren't you the one who played that massive trick last time? `
`I don't have a clue what's going on, but it looks like you got what you deserved." `
`"...By the way, Ronove, nice one." `
`"Pukukuku, thank you very much, Battler-sama." `
`The two men stuck up their thumbs as though they understood each other, chuckling together. `
`For a while, Beato was very energetic, trying to hide her embarrassment... `
`"Heh. `
`Don't take me so lightly. `
`Did you really think I'd still be hiding in a corner, holding my knees?" `
`"*cackle* `
`Then who was that person crying their eyes out in frustration last time? `
`You could've gathered your tears in a jar and called it face lotion." `
`"Sh-Shut up. `
`That was, um, just because I was a little surprised by your crappy act. `
`I might've looked a little lame, but don't think the same move'll work twice." `
`"Of course not. `
`And don't disappoint me by falling for the same move over and over again, okay? `
`*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"Ihihi, yeah, just you watch. `
`I'll show you that I'm a guy who gets stronger every time he's beaten down." `
`"......But Beato." `
`"Yes, what?" `
`"Don't do it again." `
`"Hoh? `
`Why's that? `
`So you really are weak against a rear attack?" `
`"......You and I are enemies, `
`and we'll certainly never join forces... `
`I now understand that clearly. `
`...So don't you ever try to trick me about that fact again." `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`You say that, but knowing your weaknesses, I'll......" `
`Beato thought they were still joking around, ...but that tone had disappeared from Battler's expression some time ago. `
`Beato felt as though his eyes were like the surface of black tea that had cooled down... `
`"You hear me? `
`Don't do it again." `
`"...... `
`...I don't get it. `
`I might do it again when you've forgotten, right...?" `
`"Don't do it again." `
`"......Nnn........." `
`Pierced by his strong and forceful gaze, Beato held her tongue. `
`Maybe she was certain that Battler would break that silence with laughter. `
`...However, Battler's serious expression didn't change in the slightest. `
`So to break that silence, Beato had no choice but to start laughing herself. `
`"*cackle*cackle* Hahhahahahahah, hahahahahahahahaha...!! `
`Very well. `
`You and I are worthy opponents. `
`No matter how friendly our relationship, we'll never be anything more than a pair of enemies. `
`If you have not mistaken this, that is enough for me." `
`"...That's right. `
`I almost forgot you were my enemy for a second there. `
`I won't embarrass myself like that again. `
`...I won't fall for your rear attack again. `
`Never again...!" `
`"............ `
`...Hmph! `
`Hahhahahyahhahha!! `
`It seems I'm not the only one who cannot wait for the fourth game. `
`I am pleased, Battler. `
`Come, take your seat." `
`"...Yep. `
`Just how I like it. `
`...Clever little tricks won't work anymore." `
`"Stop acting so tough. `
`You remain in a state of surrender for the last mystery in the previous game, the mystery of Nanjo's murder...!" `
`"......My answer for that one's still on hold for now. `
`But that doesn't mean that I've lost heart. `
`I'll definitely break your "red truth"...and show that I can deny witches...!" `
`"Hmph. `
`A commendable attitude. `
`You truly are a man like a phoenix. `
`Don't betray my expectations! `
`With that, let us raise the curtains on the fourth game. `
`But before that, `
`it seems we must welcome a new guest." `
`"A guest..." `
`"You remember as well, correct? `
`That mystery girl, who appeared at the very end of the last game without an invitation, ruining my fun." `
`"...That person......" `
`"She says she wants to join our game. `
`I sent her an official invitation, inviting her to join this match. `
`Ronove, summon our guest." `
`"...There's no need. `
`I'm already here." `
`The voice that answered Beato's call came from the darkness in a corner of the room. `
`When Battler turned around in surprise, he could now see that mystery girl there. `
`"My, my. `
`How rude. `
`All you had to do is greet us as soon as you arrived." `
`"I don't make a habit of talking to people before punching them. `
`After I punch is a different story though." `
`"Hoh, and what would you say?" `
`"<Good night, `
`have a nice dream>." `
`"*cackle*cackle* Hahhahhahahahahahaha! `
`How amusing, how truly amusing...!" `
`Beato cackled and clapped her hands. `
`But that was only Beato, and nothing rose to Battler's face except a bitter smile. `
`"...Whew. `
`You sure are a fighter." `
`"............" `
`Battler and the girl's eyes met, and he shrugged his shoulders as he spoke. `
`But the girl didn't answer, giving only a cold stare in return. `
`"...You helped me out at the end of the last game. `
`Thanks for that." `
`"I don't need your gratitude. `
`You were just slacking off. `
`I only told you to open your eyes." `
`"Kuhhyahhyahhya! `
`That's so true, stop slacking off, Battler, hyahhyahha!" `
`Beato tried to laugh as though sympathizing with her, but it didn't reach the girl's ears. `
`She did absolutely nothing except stare at Battler with ice-cold eyes. `
`"......Well, it looks like someone hates me." `
`"I'm just annoyed that you aren't taking this fight seriously." `
`"Are you saying I'm not serious about this...?" `
`"Don't tell me that travesty earlier was you being serious. `
`...Don't take me for a fool. `
`How long do you intend to play along with the witch's farce like this?" `
`"...I'm fighting Beato in my own way. `
`And doing it seriously, of course." `
`"Seriously? `
`......Don't make me laugh. `
`You keep on drinking tea and chatting with a witch for all eternity and call that fighting seriously? `
`Keep the jokes to just your hairdo." `
`"...Well, that's because I wasn't used to this witch's game in the beginning, and I've been through a lot of harsh stuff. `
`Still, I'm finally starting to see how to fight, and I'm getting the knack of doing it. `
`...If the pathetic way I've been acting makes it look like I haven't been serious to you, you're just wrong." `
`"......Is that so?" `
`"Of course, I know I've gotta close in a lot more before I can grab Beato by the collar. `
`But no matter how long that distance may be, it's still finite. `
`And in each game that passes, I'm steadily closing that distance step by step!" `
`"No matter how long it takes, I'll close in on that witch, and I'll definitely checkmate her. `
`...It might take a thousand years, to use her phrase. `
`...But even so, I'll definitely win sooner or later. `
`Why? `
`Because I definitely won't accept losing. `
`I definitely won't stop moving forward, closing in on her! `
`In other words, there's just one thing I can say for sure." `
`"......I will definitely win against that witch someday! `
`That's how it is." `
`"You really don't sound like you're in a hurry. `
`Are you even trying to win? `
`Even the finite can become endless if you treat it the wrong way. `
`By now, you've become an Achilles who couldn't even outstrip a turtle. `
`......I get it. So this is why I'm needed. `
`At this rate, there's no way you could win against the Endless Witch even after a billion years." `
`"...Who are you? `
`It's not like you'll be struck by lightning if you just tell me your name." `
`"............" `
`At that point, the girl fell silent, gazing straight into Battler's eyes. `
`At first, Battler faltered under the firmness of that look, and his gaze wavered slightly, but then his eyes gradually began to be sucked into the pupils that were staring at him. `
`...Then, inside those eyes, he saw a light that he'd seen sometime before... `
`Battler was struck by how strongly they resembled the eyes of a girl who definitely couldn't be here, `
`...even though that was completely impossible. `
`"...I know it's stupid, `
`...but for some reason, it feels true to me. `
`But that can't be right. `
`...That person's supposed to still be six years old. `
`............You couldn't possibly be... `
`...Ange, could you......?" `
`"......... `
`If I were to say "That's right", ...would you believe me?" `
`"Nn......" `
`"I'll put it another way. `
`If I said "I am your ally, so trust me", `
`would you believe it? `
`Would you unconditionally trust some unknown girl you're meeting for the first time just because she looks a little like someone you know?" `
`"...It's because you're such a softy that you got tricked so easily in the last game and cried so bitterly. `
`...You said it yourself. `
`That kid is six, right? `
`Do I look like I'm six? `
`If I were to claim that I'm that kid despite that, would you just swallow that story?" `
`"...If you say it like that, `
`...there's no way I can argue back. `
`...Sorry. `
`That's right, I am a softy. `
`And that should've been made clear to me after the last game. `
`...Is that what you meant when you said I wasn't being serious?" `
`"Yes. `
`You may think you're fighting against a witch, but you're just getting along with her and playing. `
`...You're just playing at fighting in a friendly game of chess." `
`"That may be a serious contest for you two, `
`but looking at it from far away, I only see you playing around and following the rules like you're good friends." `
`"...... `
`...Ihihihi. `
`That's harsh." `
`"But as long as you're unable to win at this game, you won't be released from this place. `
`...That's why I came. `
`I came to bring this game to its conclusion. `
`...You claim that you're closing in on the witch, but you're just like a hamster running around in a wheel." `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`Oh, one of those? Those things that run around and around in place, night after night?" `
`"At a glance, you might think that running around in a wheel is endless. `
`...The Endless Witch {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`It's just like you. `
`He thinks he's fighting, but he's actually just running around in a wheel while making a fool of himself." `
`"...This isn't a game. `
`This is nothing more than a cage to shut him up in...for all eternity." `
`"Hoh. `
`...You liken my Endless to something like a wheel that a mouse plays in? `
`Interesting, interesting, *cackle*..." `
`"Something that's endless in a certain dimension can be less than endless in a higher one. `
`The fact that a Menger sponge has infinite surface area only matters in a world of less than three dimensions. `
`In the three-dimensional world of reality, it has zero mass. `
`Not only is it not endless, it doesn't even exist." `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...! `
`What an assertive woman. `
`It seems you are worthy of being called my enemy." `
`"......Who...are you?" `
`"I am your ally. `
`And an enemy of witches. `
`......Of course, you don't have to believe it. `
`No one can prove that I really am your ally. `
`On the contrary, it's more desirable that you keep your guard up strongly enough to find me very suspicious." `
`"......That's right. `
`Last time ended up pretty bad. `
`I've got to be at least that careful. `
`...I don't plan on getting tricked twice." `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!" `
`Beato laughed in a truly pleased way, which was humiliating only to Battler. `
`"People don't just get tricked out of the blue. `
`That only happens when they fail to check things for themselves and leave it to other people. `
`...Saying that you thought the light had turned green just because you saw other people start crossing doesn't count as an excuse for getting into an accident. `
`Get it...?" `
`"Yeah, ...I get it. `
`...You're telling me not to swallow information given to me by others, but to think for myself. `
`......In the past, I swallowed all the magic Beato showed me. `
`{i:I stopped thinking}. `
`So I was useless." `
`Battler grimaced as he remembered his many painful losses. `
`...The witch watched and laughed again, putting on a bold appearance. `
`"I'll offer you advice in a way that works to your advantage. `
`Of course, you shouldn't swallow everything I say. `
`Because no one can provide certain proof that I'm your ally." `
`In the last game, {f:5:Virgilia}, who I thought was an ally, was actually on the witch's side. `
`...Battler couldn't rid his head of that eerie smile worn by {f:5:Virgilia}, a person he'd once even thought of as trustworthy and reliable. `
`"So I don't need you to unconditionally trust me. `
`You might as well take my advice as nothing more than an opinion to be considered. `
`After all, ...the player who's fighting in a game against the witch {i:is you}. `
`"...That's right. `
`Saying I lost because I followed the moves of an outsider would be just too pathetic of an excuse." `
`"Oh yes! `
`My opponent is Battler. `
`You are nothing more than an outsider. `
`You should bear that in mind. `
`*cackle*!" `
`"No, I'm not an outsider. `
`With {f:5:Beatrice} and Ushiromiya Battler... `
`and I who gaze down from above, it's almost like a fight in the shape of a triangle. `
`At a glance, it might not look like a united front, but having a united front doesn't necessarily mean fighting together." `
`"Hoh. `
`What an odd thing to say." `
`"Just now, he described fighting with you as closing the distance. `
`But you can't measure distance with a single eye. `
`Only with two eyes are things visible in three dimensions, and only then can distance be judged. `
`...And even when you have two fields of vision, it's pointless if they're in the same place. `
`You can pin down witches more accurately when they're far apart." `
`"...Shooting from different positions and different angles. `
`...So, basically, it's crossfire. `
`Heheh, interesting." `
`"We're shooting...from different positions...and different angles. `
`...So I won't get along with anybody. `
`That's how I'll keep my own position separate and catch the witch in a pincer attack." `
`"......Are you okay with this, Battleer? `
`This girl may actually be an ambush I set up, right? `
`She might just be saying something plausible to gain your trust, right...?" `
`"...Maybe. `
`She's been saying that over and over again herself. `
`...So of course, I can't blindly accept her advice. `
`But as to whether she's worthy of trust or not, I can think for myself and make a decision. `
`As long as I don't stop thinking for myself, I won't be tricked by anyone again...!" `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!! `
`What confidence, Ushiromiya Battleer! `
`After you've said so much, `
`it makes me want to trick you all over again, you see......? `
`I can't wait to see what kind of face you'll make when you realize you've been duped once more! `
`How pleasant, kuhhahahahahahahaha!!" `
`"......It looks like you know my name, but I don't know yours. `
`...Tell me." `
`For a while, the girl remained silent, without changing her expression even once. `
`...She looked as though she couldn't decide whether to say her name or not...or possibly, as though she was deciding on the name she'd say on the spot. `
`"...Gretel." `
`"Ghetto? `
`You are?" `
`"That's my name, dumbass. `
`Call me Gretel." `
`"Then should I call myself Hansel? `
`Ihihihi, just kidding, I'm Ushiromiya Battler! `
`Call me Battler." `
`"......Nice to meet you. `
`...I hate handshakes. `
`Don't take it personally." `
`"...Ah, really? Sorry. `
`After all, it isn't certain that you're my ally. `
`...And you just told me to keep my guard up too." `
`Battler drew back his right hand, which he had stuck out. `
`His bitter smile disappeared...and was replaced with a strong resolve directed at this new fourth game. `
`"Battler, `
`...think deeply about why you must win against this witch. `
`...You can't stop with something abstract, like "I'll beat her because I don't like it". `
`...Have a deep conviction that you'll definitely defeat the witch and escape from this world." `
`"......Because there is definitely... `
`...someone waiting for you to come back. `
`...For that kid's sake as well, `
`........." `
`Maybe there was something she wanted to say. `
`Gretel clenched her fists in front of her chest and hung her head in silence, at a loss for words for a short while. `
`As though smashing through that silence, Beato spoke up in a forceful voice. `
`"Good, that should be enough of an introduction for Gretel or whoever! `
`Come, try to remember, what happened on October 4! `
`Kuhhihihihihihihi, let the curtain open on the fourth game!!" `
`At the same time, as though it had been blown by a sudden gust of wind, the clock that had been turned back to October 4, 1986...started to move. `
`While we remained in the witch's tea room, the blue-gray sea and the green Rokkenjima spread out beneath us, `
`...and we could see a boat heading there, its wake trailing behind it. `
`The sky was already cloudy, and it seemed that the barrier of the typhoon would soon shut the island away. `
`There was the boat docked in the harbor... `
`...and Gohda, helping to unload it. `
`Then, `
`...once all of its passengers had disembarked, `
`...the boat began to separate from the shoreline. `
`The relatives were gradually swallowed up by the island. `
`"Ahhahahaha! `
`Looks like you're as cheery as ever, Maria." `
`"Maria-chan, you'll trip if you aren't careful. `
`Look out...!" `
`"Uu-uu-uu-!! `
`Gonna faaall, faaall, siiink, siiink, *giggle*!" `
`...The long-missed cousins I had loved dashed across the beach, `
`...getting swallowed by the forest path that led to the mansion, and disappeared. `
`And of course, Onii-chan could be seen among them too. `
`"...Daaamn it!! `
`Stop right there, Maria!! `
`You nimble little brat!" `
`"*giggle*! Uu-uu-uu-! `
`*giggle*giggle*!" `
`Maria onee-chan, whom I'd loved, started dashing, and Onii-chan chased after her. `
`They were swallowed up by the forest. `
`Following them, Father and Mother were also swallowed up. `
`The rest of the parents were swallowed up... `
`...They were swallowed up, leaving only me behind... `
`Dumbass... `
