`"Rumor has it, Ange-chan, `
`that you jumped off the top of a skyscraper?" `
`"The groupies were getting annoying, so I thought I'd give them the slip." `
`Ange and an old gentleman wearing an expensive suit were alone in a massive, modern conference room. `
`All of the newest machines for presentations were installed there, `
`but they didn't upset its refined and composed atmosphere, `
`and that alone was enough to make the business-like theme of the room abundantly clear. `
`However, that didn't matter at all to Ange. `
`She carelessly sat on a high-class chair that executives making a salary of several ten million yen probably sat in, looking aloof from the world. `
`"It's because I knew they were remodeling on a lower floor and had a safety net out." `
`Ange talked about it like it was no big deal, but in reality, it had been a "miracle" among miracles. `
`To think that she'd shot through several layers of safety netting for the remodeling project, `
`been caught in a multi-colored banner adorning the atrium and slipped off, `
`...only to be softly caught by a final banner, land on the ground without a scratch, `
`and then briskly leave that place... It put Hong Kong movies to shame. `
`"Whether you knew there was a net or not, this is a 200-meter tall super-skyscraper we're talking about, right? `
`If things hadn't gone as you planned, there'd be a mess to deal with now." `
`"...I figured that if I died, then I'd be dead and that would be that, more or less. `
`Well, still, I was testing my luck a bit. `
`Call it youthful zeal." `
`As though saying that she'd had enough of that topic, Ange shrugged coldly. `
`Seeing that, the old gentleman, who was looking at the world below through a crack in the blinds, cackled. `
`"So, you were testing your luck, is that it...? `
`My, my, you truly are Kinzo-san's grandchild. `
`The nerve to trust your life to chance. `
`...The Chairman was also a woman who could stake her life on a bet like it was nothing, so maybe this really is the Ushiromiya blood at work. `
`...You really will make it big in the future. `
`Please, let me be blunt. `
`Why not give up this running away from home act and return to the Sumadera family?" `
`"I heard that Mom had a bad relationship with her family. `
`I don't want to go to the house of people I first met at a funeral." `
`The Sumaderas are Mom's family. `
`They're an old family from Kyoto, and compared to Mom's frank attitude, unbelievably strict. `
`The only Sumadera I'd been on good terms with was Grandpa, who was living apart from his family under the guise of retirement. `
`Mom kept in touch with him too, `
`but she avoided the rest of the family completely, almost hostilely so. `
`So when I went out to play with the Sumadera family, it was always Grandpa's house I visited. `
`When I was young, I didn't really understand it, `
`but I hear that Grandpa was in an extremely weak position, as a man who'd moved into his wife's family register, and his relationship with Grandma was also bad. `
`...You might even say that Grandma hated him and confined him to the house. `
`It isn't hard to imagine that, because she had a soft spot for Grandpa alone, `
`Mom was also hated by the Sumaderas. `
`Since I was her daughter, they probably hated me quite a bit too. `
`And yet, they appeared for the first time at Mom's funeral, `
`shamelessly going on about how big I'd gotten, like they could actually act like family after all this time... `
`When Aunt Eva died, I would inherit all the wealth of the Ushiromiya family. `
`If that wasn't what they were after, there's no way they would've been able to say such disgusting words. `
`"...Well, it's not as though I can't understand your desire for self-abandonment, now that you're all alone." `
`"This isn't self-abandonment. `
`I'm just taking a carefree stroll now that that annoying Aunt Eva has finally kicked the bucket. `
`...Everyone else is just making too big a deal out of it." `
`Of course, everyone's after the vast Ushiromiya wealth I bear. `
`They must think that becoming my guardian means they'll be able to do as they please with that wealth. `
`Just how many people have tried to get close to me, acting like they want to be a substitute parent? `
`"If you ever find that you're hurting, please talk with me if it will help, okay? `
`After all, I think of you as my own grandchild, Ange-chan." `
`"............Haah. `
`...I'll say <no, thank you> for now. `
`...More importantly, let's return to what we were talking about." `
`"Ange-chan, `
`no matter how many times you ask, I am hiding nothing. `
`The Chairman was the only survivor on Rokkenjima that day. `
`And she passed away without saying anything. `
`I myself know nothing. `
`Everything is wrapped in darkness, you see." `
`This old gentleman was one of those leaders who had been entrusted with the business group Eva had built up after she passed away. `
`The one he called Chairman was the former Chairman, Ushiromiya Eva. `
`His company once had friendly ties with Hideyoshi's business, `
`and he'd had a close relationship with both Hideyoshi and Eva. `
`For that reason, when Eva lost Hideyoshi, he became the only person to whom Eva might have let her true intentions slip. `
`Whenever Eva's heart was torn by the loss of her family, whenever she took it out on Ange, `
`he had acted as a buffer between the two, so although Ange didn't trust him, she found him a very easy person to question... `
`"That crime was... `
`no, that accident. `
`If I call it a crime, I'll get in trouble. `
`...I had the same questions about it as the public and the talk shows." `
`"...At the time of the accident, why was Aunt Eva in a place 2 kilometers away from the mansion, all alone? `
`And on the night of a storm." `
`"Back then, Kinzo-san was unsure as to whom he should select to be his successor. `
`...Officially, he'd decided on his son, Krauss-san, but he didn't have much trust in that man." `
`"...So, to fairly determine a successor from among the four siblings, he made this game-like test called the riddle of the epitaph...?" `
`"Ostensibly, yes. `
`...Kinzo-san probably planned to make Eva-san the Successor from the beginning. `
`He wanted to withdraw his own rule that the eldest son be the Successor, and instead of Krauss-san, leave the family to the extremely diligent and brilliant Eva-san." `
`"...The new rule about giving the inheritance to the one who solved the epitaph... `
`was probably nothing more than a farce to snatch the position of Successor away from Krauss-san." `
`"What do you mean...by farce?" `
`"There was no need for anyone to solve that epitaph. `
`Once it had been displayed for an appropriate amount of time, Kinzo-san could just call Eva-san, whom he truly wanted to succeed him, `
`{i:and give her the answer}. `
`In other words, that itself would provide proof of her succession to the Headship." `
`".........This isn't something they've brought up on the talk shows, is it?" `
`"Well, once you bring up the succession of the Headship, conspiracy theories tend to rise to the surface. `
`I'm no fool myself. `
`I won't go out of my way to say things that could invite misunderstandings, you see?" `
`This was his theory. `
`At that time, the Ushiromiya Family Head, Kinzo, whose remaining life was announced to be short, was troubled by the problem of who was to succeed him. `
`Normally, the Successor would be fixed as the oldest son, Krauss, whom Kinzo had chosen himself. `
`...But in his later years, Kinzo began to think that Eva would make a more fitting Family Head. `
`However, Kinzo, who was stubborn even against himself, was stymied by the title of Successor that he'd already given to Krauss, `
`and he'd searched for an {i:official stance} by which he could skip over Krauss and select Eva as his successor. `
`That official stance was the riddle of the epitaph. `
`The primary successor was still Krauss, `
`but there was a new rule, saying that if someone appeared who could solve the riddle, they would be chosen as the Successor to the Headship. `
`Then, on what would probably be his final family conference, Kinzo told Eva the answer to that riddle himself. `
`...In short, it was the same as proclaiming that Eva herself was the Successor. `
`"On that day, Eva-san was summoned by Kinzo-san, who revealed the answer to her. `
`And, so that she could succeed the Headship, he called Eva-san to the hidden mansion Kuwadorian, which only the Head knew about." `
`"......And because Aunt Eva arrived at the hidden mansion one step ahead, she escaped harm in that accident, you say? `
`Maybe Aunt Eva just killed everyone and made it look like an accident, so she could steal all of the wealth for herself, `
`and maybe that's why only she escaped unharmed." `
`"Well, that's what the papers are shouting about. `
`However, I believe Eva-san. `
`...I'd say there are several points that justify trusting her." `
`"For example...?" `
`"That ring of the Ushiromiya Family Head, which is on your finger now, Ange-chan. `
`That ring is the only one of its kind in the world, which Kinzo-san had made specially. `
`And the artisan who made it acknowledges that the object on your finger is, without a doubt, that ring." `
`The Ushiromiya Family...Head's Ring. `
`That ring, with the heft of gold and the one-winged seal on it, `
`had a diamond arranged on a pedestal, and felt both sturdy and reminiscent of the dark hobbies of the rich. `
`Kinzo had worn that on his finger without removing it even for a moment. `
`This man was saying that the fact Eva had it proved that Kinzo had acknowledged her as the Successor. `
`"After all, Eva-san certainly did have that ring. `
`And, if you take into consideration that Eva-san actually was talented, and that Krauss-san had made a fool of himself several times on the business scene, `
`I cannot imagine that Eva-san's story is completely made up." `
`"......Although there's the possibility that she murdered Grandfather in order to steal that ring. `
`Then Aunt Eva, using some kind of trick, massacred everyone and made it look like an accident." `
`"Ah, yes. `
`It seems the papers were saying something about her massacring everyone, with keeping all the wealth to herself as a goal. `
`True, Eva-san was a person capable of holding back nothing when she was determined to accomplish something. `
`Or, ...she may have committed murder just once in her life...if a chance for keeping all the Ushiromiya family wealth for herself presented itself. `
`......However, I don't think that happened." `
`"So, what's the second point that justifies your trust in her?" `
`"Eva-san's family. `
`Hideyoshi-san and George-kun. `
`...It might be difficult for you to believe all of a sudden, Ange-chan, but Eva-san was a person who treasured family greatly." `
`...True, part of me didn't want to believe it or acknowledge it. `
`But I did understand vaguely. `
`Aunt Eva certainly had been a person who highly treasured her family. `
`After all, the root of her twisted personality had been nothing more than the sadness of losing her beloved husband and son. `
`After getting hit with her angry outbursts as she tried to distract herself from that pain, I have no feelings of sympathy at all, `
`...but it's not like I can't imagine how the incredible shock of losing her whole family must've changed her character. `
`"...You're saying there's no way Aunt Eva, who loved her family, would throw away her husband and her son?" `
`"That's right. `
`Even if Eva-san really was the culprit and massacred the entire family, making it look like an accident, `
`...she most certainly would have spared her husband and her son." `
`"She would quibble that, by coincidence, only her family had been in the hidden mansion. `
`If Hideyoshi-san and George-kun had been safe, even I would probably suspect Eva-san." `
`"...I truly cannot imagine that Eva-san's wailing at Hideyoshi-san's funeral was an act." `
`"......Sounds like both points so far are just circumstantial evidence. `
`That isn't the same as physically proving Aunt Eva's innocence." `
`"Hahahaha. `
`If you say that, then you're stuck right away. `
`Eva-san was the only survivor. `
`And she says that this is the truth." `
`"But no one can prove her innocence." `
`"Yes, that's right. `
`And no one can prove that she committed a crime either." `
`"............" `
`"And the final point that justifies trusting her...is the police. `
`After all, it was such a flashy crime. `
`The police were being pushed forward by a public in an uproar over conspiracy theories, so they must have investigated Eva-san thoroughly." `
`It was easy to feel something unnatural about the claim that Eva had avoided the accident by coincidence... `
`because she alone had escaped to a hidden mansion. `
`Furthermore, at the time, Hideyoshi's company had been right in the middle of a takeover struggle, and in order to buy off the big stockholders, she'd wanted a large sum of cash. `
`It shouldn't be too hard to find a motive there. `
`But as a matter of fact, there had been nothing at all that implicated Eva as she went to the family conference. `
`Nothing unnatural was found on her that could've been used to brutally murder her family and make it look like an accident. `
`The servants who escaped harm by being off-duty on that day also stated that they hadn't seen anything strange regarding anyone related to the event, Eva included. `
`Putting all of that together, `
`it could only be concluded that Ushiromiya Eva had headed to Rokkenjima for a normal family conference, without any change, `
`and had encountered an accident... `
`"The police looked so intensely, and they still couldn't find evidence that it was a crime. `
`...They reached that conclusion themselves. `
`Doesn't this resolve the Rokkenjima Suspicion?" `
`"...That just means that the police `
`{i:couldn't find} evidence that it was a crime, right?" `
`"There's nothing I can say to counter that. `
`It becomes a Devil's Proof. `
`To expose it as her crime, you would simply need to find evidence. `
`But what could you possibly find to prove her innocence? `
`It's impossible to prove a negative fact." `
`"...Did Aunt Eva commit a crime, or did she not...? `
`Because we can't find any materials that'll let us say for sure, the truth will remain a mystery... That's what you're saying, right?" `
`"......That's it. `
`Phrased in a manner you would prefer, that's what it amounts to. `
`It was impossible even for Eva-san to prove her own innocence. `
`On that island, an unfortunate accident occurred. `
`And Eva-san survived by chance. `
`And we don't know any more than that!" `
`"In short, it all comes down to whether you believe the story of the only survivor, Eva-san, or not. `
`...I believed. `
`The ring and her praiseworthy love for her family. `
`And the tears she shed at the funeral. `
`Taking all of that into consideration, I decided to believe her story." `
`"...But I don't believe. `
`If she wanted to steal the ring, there were probably many ways for her to do it, and no one knows if her relationship with her family really was that good. `
`No one can prove that tears at a funeral are real." `
`"...Anyway, I hated Aunt Eva from the very beginning. `
`So I don't even want to believe her." `
`"Hahahaha... `
`How does one view the truth of the crime? `
`You and I are on completely opposing sides. `
`Even though the information we are given is exactly the same, we interpret it in completely different ways." `
`"......This happens often in politics and business. `
`The exact same enterprise will always be assessed in multiple, differing ways. `
`Do you know why?" `
`"......Why?" `
`"It's a question of whether one has love. `
`...Whether you feel love for someone or not completely changes how you view them. `
`If a person you like gives to the poor, you respect them for it, right? `
`But if someone you hate starts donating, you fiercely protest that it's a publicity stunt or that they're handing out favors." `
`"No matter what they do or don't do, you thank them if you have love and criticize them if you don't. `
`That's how the world works." `
`"Can Aunt Eva be trusted, or can't she...? `
`...You're saying that's all that really matters?" `
`"Those who suspect her will probably take anything she does or doesn't do and truly see it as something unnatural. `
`And it works in reverse. `
`...As for me, `
`I think that, barring certain extreme cases, truth might not exist in this world at all." `
`"No, even if truth does exist, `
`whether you believe it or not is determined by whether you have love or not. `
`...Can you really call truth without certainty truth? `
`Even if Eva-san had been able to show physical proof that she had an alibi, would you have been able to believe it?" `
`"........." `
`It's hard to counter that. `
`...I hate Aunt Eva, so I'll probably deny any information beneficial to her... `
`and interpret any neutral information in a negative way. `
`...In other words, the truth is already decided inside me. `
`So just what in the world is this "truth" that I'm still searching for, unsatisfied...? `
`"That's how it is. `
`So, no matter what you hear from me, since you still suspect Eva-san after all this time, `
`nothing will change. `
`At the very least, even if you were to grasp a piece of hitherto unknown information, I don't think you'd be able to reach the truth the way you are now." `
`"......So I can't... `
`reach the truth?" `
`"After all, `
`no matter what kind of new information or proof you find, Ange-chan, it won't change your stance that Eva-san is the culprit, right? `
`So it's pointless to investigate anything more. `
`Because {i:the truth inside of you is already decided}." `
`"............" `
`"However... `
`If you stop assuming that to be the truth, if you wish to struggle further towards the deeper, real truth, there is a single way. `
`I believe I already mentioned it, `
`but do you know what it is?" `
`"...Is it...love? `
`I don't really know what you mean." `
`"Right now, you're considering this under the assumption that Eva-san is the culprit. `
`But that's no different than looking at something with a single eye. `
`With one eye, no matter how much you squint, you cannot see an object in three dimensions, right? `
`That's why we have another eye. `
`And of course, it's in a different position from the first eye." `
`"......You're telling me to look at things based on the supposition that Aunt Eva isn't the culprit, `
`...or else, that it was a real accident...?" `
`"Yes, yes, that's correct. `
`When thinking about anything, you should always try to look at it from different perspectives. `
`If you don't, you won't understand anything about what is real." `
`"It's the same with newspapers. `
`You can't see anything from the single viewpoint of a writer who wrote an article in a single newspaper. `
`Sometimes you can only process information composedly and in three dimensions when you read multiple newspapers." `
`"...Without love, the truth cannot be seen. `
`......Hmm, sounds nice, wahahaha." `
`Maybe he thought it interesting that such a flashy phrase would pop out of his mouth. `
`For a while, he laughed, looking pleased. `
`...At the same time, he was telling me that he'd said everything he knew... `
`and that it was about time to leave. `
`I understood that and got to my feet. `
`"I do understand your feelings, Ange-chan. `
`You should do as you like for a while, until you're satisfied." `
`"...You were six years old at the time. `
`I understand how you must feel after losing your family before you could even understand what that meant...and how you must still be unable to sort out your heart." `
`"............" `
`"You may learn the truth, and you may not. `
`Eva-san may be the culprit, and she may be a victim. `
`...I pray that you find the "truth" you believe in, Ange-chan. `
`A journey at such a young age may prove to be a valuable experience." `
`"Thank you very much... `
`...I'm truly sorry to be such a bother when you're so busy, Okonogi-san." `
`"No trouble, no trouble. `
`What are you going to do now?" `
`"Well, whatever works. `
`...I've made appointments with several specialists and people related to the crime, and I plan to go visit them." `
`"I see. `
`I hope you find an answer you can accept." `
`At that time, company president Okonogi's secretary came in, handing him a memo over his shoulder. `
`He read it, then looked between it and my face. `
`"...Ange-chan, `
`my apologies that this comes right after telling you to try going on a journey, but I have some information you should lend an ear to. `
`...It looks like you're in a bit of a nasty fix right now." `
`"People after my money? `
`This is why money's stupid." `
`"Yes, but if you sell off all of the wealth, trying to donate the whole sum to the public welfare, `
`you'll make the eyes pop out of those people optimistic about their chances with your fortune." `
`"Oh, the Sumadera family? `
`Those guys act so proud, like they're my guards or something." `
`I haven't forgotten Aunt Eva. `
`There's no way I'll put myself in the care of the Sumadera family. `
`They probably want to, as Aunt Eva often threatened in the past, `
`cut off my arms and legs, throw me in a warehouse, and suck the Ushiromiya family's wealth dry. `
`"Apparently, a messenger from the Sumadera family is coming here. `
`They're saying to hand you over...no, no, that they want to protect you." `
`"A messenger, you say?" `
`"It's your aunt. `
`Kyrie-san's younger sister. `
`I believe she told me earlier that she thinks of you as a little sister." `
`"She's gotta be joking. `
`At least call me a granddaughter, you old hag." `
`"Judging from the context, it seems they have no wish to listen to your desires. `
`I have a car waiting in the parking lot two stories underground. `
`Go." `
`"...The Sumadera family is telling you to hand me over. `
`Is it really okay to let me go?" `
`"You will definitely become something big in the future, Ange-chan. `
`Let us call this a favor to be repaid upon your success. `
`...Go, quickly...!" `
`After bowing silently and deeply, Ange left that place at a dash. `
`After watching her leave, the female secretary straightened her glasses and whispered. `
`"The Sumadera family told us to stall her... `
`Is it really all right to let her go?" `
`"We did stall her, more than enough. `
`If they still don't make it in time, that's their own fault. `
`...I told Ange-chan to run for it. `
`I informed the Sumaderas that Ange-chan would be coming. `
`Whether she's caught or not, I will not be blamed." `
`"...Everything in this world...is love, you see... `
`Don't worry, she'll escape. `
`After all, that child's capable of leaping off a building to shake pursuers." `
`...Okonogi looked down again through a crack in the blinds, `
`muttering "Nope, definitely couldn't do it..." `
`Ange wasn't a fool herself. `
`She got off the elevator, but on the third floor. `
`A taxi in the second level of the basement? `
`That's so neat and clean that I don't like it. `
`It's probably better to refuse for now. `
`But my enemies aren't fools either. `
`They're probably waiting in the first floor lobby, as well as the underground parking lot. `
`It's such a massive building. `
`Instead of getting anxious and escaping outside, maybe it's better to stay inside and wait it out. `
`No, that's useless. `
`If they get their hands on a security room in a modern building like this, I'll have nowhere to run to. `
`This entire building is like a massive dead end. `
`The third floor is the business floor. `
`A young girl like me will clearly stick out. `
`Trying not to stand out any more than I had to, I walked at a brisk pace, searching for an emergency exit. `
`...It'd be perfect if that staircase was an outside one. `
`I found the door to the emergency exit. `
`After opening that heavy door, I found the outside staircase I'd hoped for. `
`I bumped into a man who looked like an employee skipping work and smoking a cigarette. `
`After glaring at me, he quickly crushed out his cigarette and went away. `
`It looked like there was no one below. `
`...If I'm gonna escape, now's my only chance...! `
`Just when I thought that, a black car slid right under me and came to a sudden stop with an incredible squealing of the tires. `
`...Judging by the sound of tires, it seemed they had several other allies, and that one of them had come here to block this path. `
`"...Not bad, Aunt Kasumi. `
`To think you'd even send a car to pick up your little sister when she's trying to get out through the emergency exit." `
`*bam*bam*! The doors of the car were forcefully opened and three black-suited men jumped out, looking up at the emergency staircase. `
`...Crap, our eyes met. `
`"12, target found. `
`Northwest side emergency stairs, third floor, send support." `
`"Ange-sama! `
`Try not to move from there! `
`Forgive our roughness...!!" `
`The three of them began to clamor up the emergency exit. `
`...They've already announced that they plan to be rough. `
`This is pretty bad. `
`As long as I don't stop breathing, they've probably been ordered to grab me no matter what, even if they've gotta rip out one of my arms. `
`*clank*clank*clank*clank*!! `
`Their heavy, wild footsteps became a helix and began to rise from the lower floors, getting closer...! `
`In the entrance lobby of the building, a woman with seven black-suited guards behind her advanced at a leisurely pace. `
`Seeing this ostentatious entrance, the security guards for the building ran up to them, asking if they had an appointment. `
`"......How typical of Tokyo people. `
`Don't you understand the status of the person you are talking to without her having to say her name...?" `
`"M-My apologies... `
`At our company, guests are to take a securi-" `
`"...Back down, scum. `
`I came because I was called by your president. `
`Call Okonogi Tetsurou here. `
`To think he would call me here and then not welcome me... How typical of Tokyo people..." `
`"My apologies. `
`Welcome to the Ushiromiya Group, Sumadera Kasumi-san." `
`With his secretary behind him, Okonogi dashingly appeared from the elevator. `
`Even though both of them wore bold smiles, they were wrapped in a tension reminiscent of the smell of gunpowder... `
`"......Where is Ange? `
`I came to greet that adorable daughter of my big sister's." `
`"Strict observance of time is our motto here at the Ushiromiya group. `
`The former Chairman herself said that those who can't keep time can't keep contracts." `
`"...You call me all the way to Tokyo, and this is all you have to show for it? `
`You let her go, didn't you." `
`"Please, she escaped from us. `
`We did stall her for quite some time, `
`but unsurprisingly, she did eventually smell a rat. `
`Of course, this wouldn't have been a problem at all if you had arrived on time, Sumadera-san." `
`"Ah, these provincials and their loose concept of time. `
`Wahhahahahahahahaha!" `
`"......What was that...? `
`What did you say to me...?" `
`You couldn't sense any of Kyrie's open frankness in Kasumi's face. `
`She wore the arrogance of the ancient Sumadera family towards the ruined Ushiromiya family, `
`...as well as pride, because she didn't want anyone to notice that her family was declining so much that they couldn't ignore the Ushiromiya family's wealth. `
`Even at a glance, it was easy to understand why Ange hated her aunt so deeply... `
`She couldn't stand even a slight insult, and though she still smiled, her eyebrow twitched. `
`At that time, the black-suited man behind Kasumi whispered to her. `
`"Ange-sama has been found. `
`We are currently dealing with her." `
`"...Oh, I'm glad we made it in time. `
`...Thank you, Okonogi. `
`It seems I can finally take my mischievous niece home. `
`...I've waited so long to talk with that girl in my tea room, with all of the tools prepared. `
`Heheheheheheh...!" `
`*clank*clank*clank*clank*...!! `
`As the violent sound drew a helix, it rushed up at me from below, threatening to swallow me up. `
`Of course, even if I fight, there's no way I'll be able to win. `
`And yet, running into the building would be like jumping into a dead end of my own accord. `
`My enemies will increase in number with time. `
`If I don't do something here and now, I won't have any more chances to escape. `
`Then, three muscular black-suited men came into view below me. `
`1, 2, 3. `
`Three people. `
`In other words, everyone who had gotten out of the car. `
`If there had been just one of them, I might've been able to dropkick them or something and smash them in the head, which might work out. `
`...But it really would be impossible with three of them. `
`Wait, ...three...? `
`...If there's just three, I should be able to make it... `
`...I can do it...! `
`"Take a deep breath...... `
`......Haaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!" `
`"What?! `
`Y-You idiot, stop!! `
`Look ooooooout!! `
`Waaaaaaaaahhh...!!" `
`"01 calling 12, is the package secure, we received a response. `
`...What happened?! `
`Respond!" `
`"...Sh-She's crazy... Damn it..." `
`......Nnnggg... `
`...Owow... `
`See, ...that worked out perfectly, didn't it? There was just the three of them, after all. `
`I've already tried that once from a higher place. `
`I knew I'd be able to jump down just three floors...! `
`It's a good thing the car they came in was right beneath me. `
`Even if it wasn't as pleasant as a trampoline, it broke my fall...a little gently, a little roughly. `
`"...How rude. `
`You didn't have to dent that much." `
`The roof of the car broke my fall, leaving a massive dent around my body. `
`Car roofs are surprisingly delicate. `
`I don't think it's because of my weight. `
`Apparently, the three people on the stairs hadn't planned on me jumping down. `
`It seemed they now realized that they'd been outwitted, and they were rushing down the stairs. `
`I've gotta run and escape while I have the chance. `
`I moved my body, making clunking sounds on the car roof. `
`But I'd been naive. `
`Of course they wouldn't all rush up the stairs without leaving one person behind. `
`There was one black-suited man left in the driver's seat of the car that had broken my fall. `
`He stuck his head out the window, and when he realized what had fallen on him, he jumped out. `
`In a rush, I jumped off the roof, but the black-suited man's reaction was really fast. `
`...Either there was a massive reward for capturing me, or there'd be some harsh punishment in store for them if they let me get away. `
`"15, secured, secured...!" `
`"Owowowow...!! `
`Ack, don't touch me like that, let go!!" `
`I was mercilessly held down against the asphalt. `
`I was being crushed face-down, covered and pressed upon from above. `
`It was a hold without a trace of elegance, but it was extremely practical and left me no room for resistance. `
`I tried to push back with both hands, searching for a way to resist, `
`but I was being pushed down solidly, and I couldn't even tear myself off the asphalt. `
`Then another car came, squealing its tires as it slid to a sudden stop. `
`Is it all over now? `
`"Gyah!!!" `
`The man that had been crushing me let out a sharp cry. `
`...He was yelling straight into my ear, making my left ear ring. `
`What in the world?! `
`Along with the black-suit guy, I fell with a *thunk*. `
`After landing face up, the first thing I saw...was an arm stuck out right in front of my eyes. `
`"......Amakusa...? `
`What are you doing here...?" `
`"Let's talk about that after we've lost them. `
`To the car, quickly, lady...!" `
`Amakusa grabbed my arm, easily pulled me up, spinning me around with himself as the center of gravity. `
`Just when I thought it was a little like a dance, he flung me through the open door into the driver's seat. `
`I climbed over the hand brake and slid into the passenger's seat. `
`Pushing me in, Amakusa also got into the driver's seat. `
`Since we suddenly accelerated while I was still on all fours, I had to kick and struggle around on the chair for a while, like a turtle that's been flipped over... `
`Amakusa checked the rear-view mirror for cars in pursuit, but he flew into the artery of the big city without lowering his speed in the slightest. `
`We sewed our way between cars one after another. `
`Just like a chase scene in some action movie. `
`...I was shaken by this horrible driving and had trouble sitting back down. `
`"Are you hurt, lady?" `
`"I'm fine. `
`Humans are surprisingly durable. `
`Next time I try to a escape a downward moving elevator, I'll jump out a window instead." `
`"Hyahhahaha, I guess air dives are a hobby of yours, lady. `
`Still, I'd recommend you grab a parachute next time." `
`"Sure, if I remember to do it after leaping." `
`"Hyahhahahahaha, <cool>!" `
`He smacked the steering wheel, guffawing. `
`Need an explanation for this flippantly-talking man? `
`His name is Amakusa Juuza ({p:0:天草十三}). `
`He was originally one of Aunt Eva's guards. `
`Didn't she start to hate him because he chatted too much? `
`He was much younger than the rest of the guards, but contrary to his outward flippancy, he'd hopped from the First Airborne of the JSDF to the French Foreign Legion, `
`placing himself in overseas private military companies and high-class security companies one after another, making for a pretty incredible and unique career. `
`...But I heard he deserted both the JSDF and the French Foreign Legion, and that he'll be arrested if he enters France again. `
`Both of these flippant episodes were very typical of him. `
`The guards were sternly told not to chat with me unnecessarily, `
`but he came and took a pass at me, didn't he? `
`Aunt Eva was apparently particularly put off by that...and had supposedly dismissed him shortly before she died. `
`"It's been a while since I've heard that carefree tone. `
`What happened after you got fired?" `
`"I was coaching some people at Blackwater. `
`When I came back to the country during my time off, President Okonogi offered me a high wage." `
`"...So, you deserted again? `
`I wonder how a man like that can be useful for anything." `
`"Doesn't count as desertion as long as I come back by next week. `
`I talked with him yesterday. `
`I was told that some troublesome people might come to call on you, lady." `
`"Sorry that turned out to be exactly right." `
`"My name probably came up since I know you, and I've got lots of crazy experience. `
`Thanks to you, it looks I'm in for a happy vacation plus some pocket money." `
`"...So, Okonogi-san employed you as my guard?" `
`"He probably wants to buy some gratitude from you, lady. `
`...After I got fired, I was indebted to President Okonogi in various ways. `
`He's got some dirt on me here and there, and now I can't say no to him. `
`Hyahha!" `
`"...Seems that getting indebted to Okonogi-san can be pretty costly later on. `
`...So, where are you planning on taking me?" `
`"Anywhere. `
`I'm employed until the weekend. `
`Anything after that'll cost you extra." `
`"How much per day?" `
`"I'll take 50 thousand. `
`Plus expenses." `
`"If you stop cracking jokes, I'll double it. `
`The period of employment isn't fixed yet. `
`It might take several weeks." `
`"...That'll be tough. `
`I'll have to call my boss to get an extension on my vacation." `
`"More than anything, I want to investigate that day." `
`"...Oh, is this about Rokkenjima?" `
`"Exactly. `
`What happened on that island 12 years ago? `
`...I want to investigate it with my own hands to my satisfaction." `
`"Do you really expect to find anything new investigating something that old...?" `
`"True. `
`But this is a journey for my own self-satisfaction. `
`...Once that's over, I'll just throw my hands up and go over to the Sumadera family. `
`...Didn't Aunt Kasumi say something about how she wanted to serve me some matcha? `
`Maybe she'll serve me tea as I kneel on sharp wooden blocks, clutching stones or something." `
`"Damn that sounds freaky, hyahhahahaha...!" `
`"My apologies, we lost sight of them... `
`A single man thought to be an associate assisted in her escape. `
`Judging by his possession of a stun gun and his driving skills, he's no amateur." `
`"......I see, thank you. `
`......What a shame, Okonogi. `
`Shall I take this as your answer...?" `
`"Letting her get away was your blunder. `
`It has nothing to do with me." `
`"......I do wish to prepare some matcha for you as well in the near future. `
`The next time you're in Kyoto, please stop by. `
`......I'm going." `
`"Oh, are you leaving already? `
`{c:86EF9C:I could offer you some chazuke first.}" `
`".........*cackle*cackle* `
`...Hohohohoho...!!" `
`With her back still facing Okonogi, she laughed softly, but with an increasingly shrill and hateful tone, using that as a substitute for a sharp parting remark. `
`Just as she stopped laughing, her features suddenly changed to look like a demon's, `
`but because her back was facing him, Okonogi couldn't see that expression. `
`Okonogi watched her go, laughing coolly. `
`His secretary whispered over his shoulder. `
`"...Are you sure about this? `
`Milady Ange is our company's primary stockholder. `
`If the Sumadera family becomes her guardian..." `
`"I get it. `
`But you know, we're the world-famous Ushiromiyas. `
`We can't let them take us lightly. `
`...Still, it looks like that guy managed it pretty well. `
`...All that's left is to let Ange-chan do as she pleases. `
`I'm counting on you, Amakusa." `
`"...Kasumi-sama, `
`the escaping car was a rental. `
`The license plate they displayed was a fake. `
`We're clearly dealing with a pro. `
`They'll probably abandon the car. `
`Pursuit will be difficult. `
`...Should we have the police chase them?" `
`"......Hmm, yes. `
`Shall we have them search for our runaway daughter? `
`They are getting paid with our taxes, so the police must be of some use every once in a while. `
`Hohohoho......" `
`"When I left the mansion, I boldly told mother to leave it to me, didn't I? `
`Do you intend to embarrass me further...? `
`It looks like it might be better for me to serve some matcha for everyone at once, doesn't it? `
`...Our underground tea room is cramped, so you'll have to wait in line..." `
`"N-No... `
`We will search with everything we have." `
`"...Ah, she really is a cute kid, just like Nee-san. `
`...Especially that way she freewheels and does as she pleases. `
`...Ah, now I can't see anything but Nee-san. `
`Ah, I'm truly looking forward to it. `
`If only I could invite Nee-san's daughter to my tea room, right...? `
`Hohohohoho...!!" `
`"...The Sumadera family sure moved quickly. `
`Did Okonogi-san sell me out...?" `
`"You're joking. `
`He's my client. `
`If he'd sold you out, he wouldn't have hired me, right...?" `
`"......... `
`...I guess that's true." `
`"...Ah, so that's why you got off the elevator at the third floor." `
`"Him having a car waiting in the underground parking lot was just too convenient. `
`I figured Okonogi-san sold me out. `
`...Though I guess by now, it's impossible to prove whether there was an ambush set up in the parking lot or not." `
`"I see, that poor president guy. `
`Looks like you don't trust him a bit, lady. `
`That car in the basement...was mine." `
`"Huh...? `
`He was talking about you, Amakusa...?" `
`"I freaked when the elevator came and was empty. `
`I wonder what would've happened by now if I hadn't been listening in on their radio." `
`"......So what's going on? `
`If I'd obediently believed Okonogi-san and gone to the parking lot, `
`there would've been no need for me to do that jump off the third floor...?" `
`"Pretty much, yeah. `
`Well, it turned out okay in the end." `
`"............" `
`......What the hell. `
`If I hadn't suspected President Okonogi, `
`...I could've easily escaped without getting caught in a tough spot. `
`"President Okonogi might have sold me out". `
`No, since paranoia told me that it was better to assume that he'd sold me out, I supposed and {i:concluded} that "He sold me out". `
`Because of my inability to believe in him, regardless of his truth, `
`my truth became "He sold me out"... `
`I thought back on President Okonogi's words. `
`Can you really call truth without certainty truth...? `
`Truth can change completely depending on whether you have love or not. `
`In the end, ...perhaps truth itself doesn't exist. `
`There are as many interpreted truths as there are people who speak of the truth. `
`If I can't accept something that fluid as truth, `
`...where does the truth that I really want to find exist? `
`...And is it something I'll be able to see with my eyes? `
`...Even if someone sticks the truth right there in front of me and says it's the truth, `
`I might not be able to {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} it... `
`"...Without love, it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}, huh?" `
`"......This Fragment of yours is very lively. `
`It doesn't bore me." `
`"You told me something. `
`You commanded me to search for the truth of 12 years ago. `
`...But there's something I'm not getting." `
`"What's that?" `
`"...What is truth? `
`There are as many truths as there are people. `
`There are as many interpretations as there are people. `
`And those can be twisted by opinions and changed indefinitely. `
`...Is truth really that unfixed and vague?" `
`"That's right. `
`...Truth is unfixed. `
`It can be like a particle, or like a wave, and it can hold conflicting forms at the same time. `
`You are free to believe that the cat in the box is alive or dead. `
`...But the truth is very delicate. `
`It can change its appearance just by being observed." `
`"You're talking about stuff like Schrodinger's cat box? `
`......Nonsense. `
`If you open the box, you learn the truth. `
`Discussion about what happens before you open it is just an armchair theory." `
`"That's right. `
`And yet, in order to deny that abstract theory, you need to open the box. `
`...It is impossible to negate any idea about the contents of a box that cannot be opened. `
`This is what truth is." `
`"......As long as truth isn't denied, it keeps its form." `
`"That's right. `
`As long as truth isn't observed, it keeps its form." `
`"In other words, if it isn't exposed, any reckless statement can suffice as truth." `
`"Yes. `
`...Even if they contradict each other, endless ideas can exist as truth at the same time without being negated." `
`"......So even something as screwed up as my family being captured by the Rokkenjima witch and shut up 12 years ago for all eternity... `
`can exist as truth as long as we don't know what happened 12 years ago..." `
`"This witch called {f:5:Beatrice}...forcibly made room for "Endless" imaginings in the Rokkenjima of 12 years ago, enveloping all of it inside a cat box. `
`Everything inside the unopenable box is truth." `
`That's right. `
`{i:We don't know what happened on that island}, so it becomes endless. `
`"...That's assuming no one opens it up. `
`I just have to wrench it open. `
`......But that box was closed up 12 years ago, and I don't even know where it is. `
`...Even if I visit Rokkenjima, just what can I learn about what happened 12 years ago on that desolated island?" `
`"Who knows? `
`I wonder what you could learn. `
`......This is something that can only be done by the person who is able to walk around freely in the world of 1998, 12 years in the future: `
`the final witch, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}." `
`"........." `
`"{f:5:Beatrice}'s game board lasts two days, from October 4, 1986 to the 5th. `
`In other words, you're a piece who can move freely outside her game board. `
`...And even {f:5:Beatrice} cannot influence this future that lies outside the game board." `
`"...If you say it like that, it sounds like I'm a pretty overpowered piece." `
`"The future of 12 years later in which you are placed certainly is distant. `
`However, the further a piece is placed in the future, the stronger power it holds. `
`...I told you, didn't I? `
`The truth changes its appearance when it is observed." `
`"Come to think of it, I heard something like that once. `
`...Even if one day, all of a sudden, a star in the constellation Centaurus were to explode, `
`the light from that explosion would have to cross 4.4 light years, so it would take it four and a half years to reach the Earth." `
`"That's right. `
`In other words, even if the sun in Centaurus has already died, people on Earth won't be able to perceive that fact for four and a half years. `
`...Because no method of perception exists that is faster than the speed of light." `
`When we learn that the sun in Centaurus has exploded... `
`We Earth people will paint over our history of four and a half years ago with a new truth. `
`We will revise history with a new fact: that it exploded four and a half years ago. `
`However, for the four and a half year period until we learn that, despite the fact that it has already died, `
`the mistaken truth that the sun of Centaurus still exists will be able to exist as truth. `
`The truth of the future wins against the truth of the past. `
`".........That's right. `
`By itself, the Rokkenjima accident gave rise to nothing but `
`suspicion of a conspiracy involving Aunt Eva and the Ushiromiya family assets. `
`...But later on, `
`...it was dramatized and linked to the occult, and the conspiracy was painted over by the Legend of the Witch." `
`Even though it was clambered over as a conspiracy at the time of the crime, `
`later on, strange occult theories, which claimed that it was the work of the witch, ran rampant and began to paint over the truth of October 5, 1986... `
`The conspiracy theories will probably be forgotten over time. `
`...And only the more bizarre, impressive witch theory will continue to remain as superstition, eventually covering up the conspiracies. `
`"That's right. `
`The false truth that exists before the light from an exploding star reaches Earth is almost like the conspiracy theory, which is a human theory. `
`......The wine bottle with a letter in it that drifted ashore several years later, the "message bottle", painted over that theory and made things return to the occult theory, which is a witch's theory." `
`"...That's right. `
`A witch didn't exist during 1986. `
`The witch took control of Rokkenjima because she was "observed" several years later by us humans of the future, thanks to that message bottle...!" `
`"...A small revision is necessary. `
`The witch could have existed even during 1986. `
`As one of many endless possibilities that can exist." `
`"Certainly. `
`She'd disappear if she were observed, so she curls up inside the cat box. `
`...That's what makes the message bottle so nasty." `
`"...The witch tried to get out of the box. `
`She made it so that she'd be observed, weeding out possibilities that conflicted with the witch theory. `
`...In other words, to make it impossible to negate her, she negated all possibilities other than the witch theory." `
`"......What the hell. `
`So in other words, {f:5:Beatrice} satisfied the Devil's Proof with a frontal attack. `
`And, that was part of the witch's plan from the beginning." `
`"The message bottle is information observed in the future after 1986. `
`......It cannot be observed by {f:5:Beatrice} or Battler. `
`...It can only be observed by {f:5:Ange Beatrice}." `
`"...I really didn't want to investigate the message bottle. `
`...After all, reading that would be like listening to the witch's say. `
`I thought the witch theory was just a crazy fantasy, so I thought of it as nothing more than a waste of time." `
`"...But Okonogi-san told me. `
`You can't see things in three dimensions with only one eye." `
`"You mean that while looking at it from the viewpoint of denying witches, you must also look at it from the viewpoint of accepting witches? `
`...That's a correct way of thinking. `
`The number of viewpoints is like a denominator. `
`If you have one viewpoint, the mystery in the numerator doesn't decrease in the slightest. `
`However, the more your number of viewpoints increases, the more the mystery begins to be divided." `
`"I understand. `
`...There was a message bottle that washed up on a neighboring island several years after the crime. `
`That passed into the hands of a dilettante. `
`I made an appointment with him, just in case." `
`...I was able to hear Aunt Eva's say from Okonogi-san. `
`Next up is...the witch's say. `
`Why don't I listen? `
`To {f:5:Beatrice}'s say...! `
