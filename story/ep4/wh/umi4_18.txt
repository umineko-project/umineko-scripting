`"Amakusa, could you turn that off?" `
`"Whoops, my bad. `
`You don't like M. Zakky?" `
`"I'm just not in the mood." `
`Amakusa turned the radio off. `
`The world of cheery sounds was immediately swallowed up by the roar of the sea... `
`and blotted out by the ocean's gray... `
`"......Can you see it? `
`Over there's where the harbor was at the time." `
`"............" `
`The boat captain pointed, but I couldn't really recall that scene of 12 years ago. `
`...I thought I'd surely be able to immediately remember how things had been at the time, `
`...but no memories came back to me. `
`After that incident, the island was sealed off and left to the wild. `
`...I couldn't satisfy myself with the thought that this was just inevitable, and it felt sad and painful for some reason. `
`......Ah, but I at least remember one thing. `
`You might say that it'd probably be the same anywhere on the sea, ...but I remember at least one thing. `
`The cries... `
`of the seagulls. `
`I do remember...those. `
`...When I was young, I rarely went to the ocean. `
`...So everything that symbolized the ocean meant Rokkenjima and a family gathering to me. `
`In short, ...it was a symbol for the happiness of going out with my family. `
`However, at this point in time, it seems doubtful whether that even was happiness. `
`In my younger days, the trip had felt like a relaxed family vacation, but considering my parents' situation at the time, `
`it was surely a very difficult trip to handle, with the distribution of the inheritance filling the place with the smell of gunpowder. `
`I can remember giggling all over the place, completely ignorant of my parents' feelings... `
`"...Rokkenjima, huh? `
`The place of all beginnings, and the end of the line for all journeys." `
`Amakusa, in an attempt to speak for my innermost feelings, tried to sound cool. `
`The boat slowly rounded the island. `
`...I hoped that viewing it at a different angle might bring back my memories of the island's silhouette at the time just a little, `
`but in the end, even when that inlet was hidden completely by cliffs, I wasn't able to remember anything... `
`"...Captain, please tell me... `
`about that other harbor you mentioned." `
`"Sure. `
`......Rokkenjima supposedly has only one harbor. `
`But that's only for public appearances." `
`"On the back of the island, there's another hidden harbor. `
`......Like Rokkenjima itself. `
`It has a second face, which no one knows about..." `
`"......Rokkenjima is an island owned by the Ushiromiya family. `
`But it has another face, as an island owned by Kinzo‐san personally......" `
`"So this island...has two harbors and two mansions. `
`He sure spent a lot just to keep a mistress." `
`"Who knew about this other harbor...?" `
`"Very few. `
`Kinzo-san, the butler Genji-san. `
`Those of us involved with the boats, `
`and a very small number of the oldest servants. `
`...Both the previous owner of the Nanjo clinic and that Kumasawa baa-san knew. `
`Naming them off like this makes it sound like there were quite a few, but basically, there was a small number of people who knew." `
`"Please...tell me about that other mansion." `
`"...I was only told that there was a mansion called Kuwadorian. `
`Since I wasn't allowed to leave the boat, I never saw it, not even once." `
`"So it was far enough away that you couldn't see it from the harbor?" `
`"I don't know. `
`...But it was a hidden mansion, after all. `
`It was probably built where you couldn't see it from the outside. `
`...Anyway, Kuwadorian was the biggest secret of that island." `
`"There's a theory that {f:5:Beatrice} lived in Kuwadorian, or else was confined there. `
`What do you think, Captain?" `
`"...I did sometimes carry miscellaneous goods to Kuwadorian. `
`And that included a lot of stuff that only women would use, and expensive stuff at that. `
`...I'm also convinced that theory is true." `
`"So does that mean you never saw {f:5:Beatrice} directly, Captain?" `
`"Nope. `
`Came and went for about 20 years, and I never saw her once." `
`"Twenty years...! `
`Whew, that means she was at least 20+. `
`Look's like she wasn't some mademoiselle." `
`"But one day, *bang*, all coming and going to and from Kuwadorian suddenly stopped. `
`That was about 30 years ago, `
`...so around Showa 43 (1968), I think." `
`"*bang*? `
`You mean suddenly?" `
`"...We came to the Hidden Side on a set schedule to carry food and trash back and forth. `
`...Ah, right, the Hidden Side's what we called the harbor linked to Kuwadorian." `
`"I get it. `
`...So then?" `
`"One day, we got an urgent message from Genji-san. `
`He said that until we heard differently, there was no need for us to go to the Hidden Side anymore." `
`"And did you hear differently?" `
`"Not really. `
`Long story short, one day, I was suddenly told that they wouldn't need regular service to the Hidden Side anymore...and that I didn't have to take food there either. `
`...At first, I thought I was being fired. `
`But I quickly figured it out. `
`...Going by the reactions of the servants who knew of Kuwadorian, I managed to guess somehow." `
`"......{f:5:Beatrice} died, and there was no longer any need to take food or people to care for her?" `
`"That's what I think. `
`From that point on, I was never told to take a boat to the Hidden Side. `
`However, after that, Genji-san came to see me face to face and got pushy, `
`strongly urging me never to speak of anything related to the Hidden Side until I died." `
`"So, if that hidden mansion was abandoned for 20 whole years, `
`......why was Aunt Eva there?" `
`On that day 12 years ago... `
`...Ushiromiya Eva somehow escaped harm alone in a hidden mansion 2 kilometers away from the mansion. `
`Why was she in a hidden mansion that had been forgotten for 20 years......? `
`"I saw on the talk shows. `
`Even I don't have a clue what happened. `
`Not once did I guide Eva-san to the Hidden Side. `
`I have no idea how or why she knew about or reached Kuwadorian." `
`"I wonder if it was possible to reach this Hidden Kuwadorian by land." `
`"...If, as we heard, the forest was dense and uncultivated, `
`I seriously doubt a well-dressed lady person'd be able to bush-crash it." `
`"So what about by sea? `
`Maybe there was a motorboat or something." `
`"Are you kidding? `
`That two-nighter typhoon was awful. `
`No way you could'a used a boat." `
`"So what if...there was an underground passage or something between the mansion and Kuwadorian. `
`Wouldn't it have been a pain to have to charter a boat each time he wanted to visit his mistress's house...?" `
`"You mean a tunnel long enough to connect mansions on opposite sides of a 2 kilometer island like Rokkenjima...?" `
`"...Well, I'd like to laugh at the thought, but this rich guy made a whole hidden mansion for his mistress. `
`Guess I can't deny the possibility. `
`...What do you think, Captain?" `
`"I'm a man of the sea. `
`I don't know about holes. `
`But the Japanese military dug a 25 kilometer tunnel on Iwo Jima. `
`Wouldn't surprise me if "that" Kinzo-san could dig at least 2 kilometers." `
`".........There really is something wrong with this island. `
`Even now, not one of us really knows a thing about it." `
`The boat reached the shore. `
`They would have to walk a short ways to reach the mansion. `
`"...I'll wait here. `
`The mansion's that way. `
`The path from back then's probably still there, but I'll bet it's covered with plants. `
`Make sure you don't get lost." `
`"Right, let's go." `
`"Thanks for everything, Amakusa. `
`You wait here too." `
`"......Well, I had a feeling you'd say that." `
`"I'm just delivering something. `
`It'll be troublesome for them if you come too. `
`I imagine your toxin is strong." `
`"Toxin? `
`Oho." `
`"I'll be back soon. `
`Today, our main goal is Kuwadorian. `
`...After I deliver this, I'll come right back." `
`Ange put on her knapsack, holding the flowers she would offer. `
`"Give her some space, young'un. `
`...See you soon, little lady. `
`Your family's waiting for you." `
`I had never been on a road like this, but I had no trouble finding my way. `
`If I walked straight ahead, it would probably guide me to the final destination for everything. `
`It was true that the vegetation was incredibly thick, and if I didn't pay attention, I would lose track of the path. `
`...But the road that was left was much clearer than I'd guessed it would be. `
`Still, that didn't change the fact that it was a bad road. `
`...Contrary to the distance shown on the map, I was forced to walk a long way... `
`...The forest was deep and dark. `
`At the time, I had been threatened into staying away from the forest because a witch lived there. `
`Of course, that fear is gone now, ......but...I feel it. `
`Because I was me, `
`...I could feel the presence, like an aura, of the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}... `
`Here and there were massive fallen lumps of rock along with overgrown trees and ivy. `
`...And the voices of birds and bugs. `
`Yeah, I feel it. `
`......I feel...that the witch...is here... `
`Ahead, an ivy-covered construction site fence and warning sign stood. `
`"No entry, Tokyo Metropolis". `
`That was written on it. `
`Yeah, that's right. `
`When you think "Tokyo", you tend to think of a city, `
`but Rokkenjima is also located within the Tokyo Metropolis. `
`...Apologizing to the sign for my rude mistake, I climbed the fence. `
`When I crossed the steep slope beyond that, ......my field of vision rapidly expanded, `
`and a fresh sea breeze blew through my hair... `
`It was like the top of a little hill. `
`...Below me was a vast view of the island. `
`I could only see desolated forest and rock walls spread out below me. `
`...But I realized that the mansion was probably somewhere around there. `
`The steep downward slope beyond this hill had probably been caused by earth and rocks collapsing from 12 years of wind and rain. `
`It had become a slant filled with crags that you might even call gentle cliffs, `
`and it would be easy to tumble down, though it looked like climbing back would be pretty difficult. `
`......In any event, it seemed that proceeding any further would be impossible. `
`If I continued any further, I wouldn't be able to return. `
`In other words, ......this is...the border. `
`This place is 1986 and 1998. `
`And, it is that day and today. `
`The boundary between this world and nirvana. `
`"......This spot is... `
`this journey's final destination, it seems." `
`As the strong winds blew Mammon's and Sakutaro's hair, they looked down from the hilltop... `
`"...From here, I can't really tell. `
`Where's the mansion? `
`Let's get closer." `
`‘Uryu, ...that's impossible. `
`We won't be able to come back.’ `
`...We won't be able...to come back. `
`...Is that it? `
`I see. `
`...This is 1998, `
`...and I am the Ushiromiya Ange who has been left all alone. `
`At first, this was a journey to die. `
`But not anymore. `
`It's become a journey to accomplish something... `
`"Yeah. `
`...So, I'm sorry, you two. `
`Although, as I was back then on that day, I would've gone down that cliff without any hesitation." `
`"Come on, this is pretty lame for the skyscraper-jumping Ushiromiya Ange." `
`"Sorry." `
`‘This place is as good as any. `
`......After all, you can feel the wind of that day.’ `
`"...... `
`...Was the wind...really like this?" `
`‘Yeah. `
`Very soon, they will come. `
`.........Everyone.’ `
`Sakutaro said it as though it was completely natural. `
`...And...I believed it. `
`Mom. `
`Dad. `
`Onii-chan. `
`All of my relatives, and those fun servants. `
`And......Maria onee-chan. `
`"It's me. `
`...It's Ange. `
`......I've...come back." `
`When I started my journey to expose the past of 12 years ago, my goal had been abstract, and I hadn't understood. `
`But now, ...I have no doubts. `
`This journey...was induced by several thoughts and fates over 12 years. `
`A journey to reach an end for me, Ushiromiya Ange. `
`And, a journey reach an end as the last witch of Mariage Sorcière. `
`I came here as the last daughter of the Ushiromiya family... `
`and as the last witch... `
`"...Dad, Mom, Onii-chan. `
`...Sorry. `
`Let me greet Maria onee-chan first." `
`A strong tailwind urged me on. `
`That tailwind took just my soul out from inside my body...to the vast forest beneath me. `
`And, though from here on I couldn't see, I believed that it flew me to the mansion on that day, `
`to where everyone was, ...to where Maria onee-chan was. `
`And so, `
`...even though my body was on the top of a hill, a strong wind blowing against me, `
`...my soul was now certainly dancing through that sky... `
`The vast, vast sky of Rokkenjima. `
`...Below me was the green of many trees. `
`But...I understand. `
`I can comprehend the presences of my family and relatives...and all the servants. `
`......And...Maria onee-chan too. `
`I could even comprehend...Maria onee-chan as a witch. `
`It was vast, more so than any vast space I had imagined up until now. `
`"......Maria onee-chan, `
`can you hear me...? `
`Listen...!!" `
`Ange called to the Maria of that day. `
`She told her of the long journey she'd undergone. `
`Of her long-delayed realization of just how much she'd wounded Maria in her youth. `
`She understood magic...and now understood everything about the world Maria had wanted to show her. `
`It was very warm, overflowing with love and happiness. `
`...She wanted to become even happier by sharing that world, `
`but I trampled it. `
`"So now, I finally understand everything. `
`......I understand magic...! `
`Our magic is surely very faint and fills the space beside us. `
`...But it isn't something that anyone can see with their eyes. `
`......Magic is... `
`...yes, I can say it clearly." `
`——Without love, it cannot be "seen". `
`Sorry, Onee-chan. `
`...I've already been excommunicated from the alliance of witches, `
`but now, I understand how wonderful it is. `
`And......I know that, after the day I wounded you, Mariage Sorcière... `
`was transfigured into something different from what you truly desired. `
`......Even the magic that spat anger by cursing people was probably important to Onee-chan in those days. `
`Onee-chan's environment was sad enough to permit that. `
`"But now, `
`......those sad days...are over. `
`......So, `
`...let's return Onee-chan's alliance of witches... `
`...back to the original Mariage Sorcière." `
`The grimoire was in my hands before I realized it. `
`...The strong winds were rapidly blowing its pages one after another... `
`That world had been kind in the beginning. `
`How could you give birth to magic that would make candy fall from the sky? `
`How could you give birth to magic that would make tomorrow's dinner creme croquette? `
`How could you give birth to magic that would make the weather good when you went out the next day, making your whole day fun? `
`New spells of happiness were created one after another, coloring her world with kindness... `
`Those days were flipped through one after another, `
`......and months began to flash by... `
`The pages with drawings that had once been colorful... `
`gradually began to change into the color of black ink... `
`...Eerie magic circles and demon summonings. `
`Evil magic for harming people. `
`How could you give birth to magic that would cause the class bully to catch a cold? `
`How could you give birth to magic that would seriously injure someone in class so that they died? `
`How could you give birth to magic that would cause a bus loaded with all the bullies to fall off a cliff? `
`Malicious spells were created one after another, `
`...burying the pages and her heart... `
`"Because I hurt Onee-chan, `
`Mariage Sorcière ended up like this. `
`......Onee-chan isn't a black, evil witch. `
`...She was a white, ...pure, innocent, `
`...kind witch..." `
`"...I'll...return it to how it was. `
`I'll bring back the original Maria onee-chan, `
`...the one who scattered magic to make people happy across the entire world. `
`...That's the reason I came here. `
`I was guided by fate. `
`......Maria onee-chan, can you hear me...? `
`......Show yourself before me......!!" `
`That voice rode an even stronger wind and was sent 12 years into the past... `
`Then, `
`...the wind gradually ceased, `
`......and silence fell... `
`*crunch*, *crunch*. `
`...I could hear the sound of gravel being stepped on. `
`I listened to those footsteps, surprised at this miracle. `
`...Without a doubt, those were Maria onee-chan's footsteps. `
`"......M-Maria onee-chan......" `
`"It's Kasumi. `
`......Looks like I finally found you, eh, Ange-chan......?" `
`"............" `
`...Before I knew it, Aunt Kasumi and her black-suits, a total of seven people who didn't resemble Maria onee-chan in the slightest, `
`were standing there, surrounding me. `
`And it felt like my voice had been just about to reach Maria onee-chan, too... `
`...Because of these guys' toxin, ......that magic was cut off... `
`Ange clicked her tongue at that, but Kasumi probably didn't hear it that way. `
`"......Hmmmm. `
`Are those flowers for your deceased family? `
`...How admirable. `
`You're going to throw them, right? `
`Go ahead, we'll wait that long." `
`...Just what are you waiting for...? `
`...But Ange could more or less guess. `
`The way the black-suits unnaturally stuck their hands into their pockets clearly brought to mind the likelihood that they had handguns. `
`......This is a deserted island. `
`There could be no more convenient place to dispose of someone. `
`I have absolutely no interest in the family matters of the Sumadera family. `
`...But if I die, all that wealth will go to them. `
`Unlike me, they're probably very interested and concerned about this matter. `
`Of course, it seems that if the massive amounts of stock I own suddenly go to them, `
`it'll be pretty bad for the Ushiromiya Group as well, `
`and they're apparently having a secret feud, fighting over me all by themselves. `
`...That's probably why President Okonogi gave me Amakusa as a guard. `
`......Having Amakusa wait on the boat was a regrettable mistake... `
`"Aunt Kasumi, how long have you been waiting for this ambush...?" `
`"Since early morning. `
`Thanks to that, I'm completely tired of waiting. `
`After all, there are no cafes or dressing rooms here." `
`"No toilets either, so I guess you had to elegantly drop a load behind a tree. `
`......ack-" `
`"A lady with half Sumadera blood flowing through her veins will not use such filthy words. `
`......You really are Sumadera Kyrie's child. `
`Not a trace of grace." `
`She grabbed me by the hair and forced my face up to hers. `
`And then spat at me. `
`...My words might be filthy, but they're no worse than her spit. `
`"......Every time you talk to me, Aunt Kasumi, it's always about Mom. `
`...Am I really that much like my mother?" `
`"Yes, you are. `
`......That impertinent gaze. `
`Your mouth and nose are the same too. `
`...Freewheeling and irresponsible. `
`...You thought nothing of the long history and tradition of the Sumadera family...and selfishly flew out of the house. `
`Thanks to that, my entire life has been devoted to cleaning up your mess...!" `
`"I guess your life really has been covered with crap." `
`When I was slapped on the cheek, my ear was smashed, and for an instant, my head rang... `
`......My hair was pulled, spinning me around, and I fell to the ground. `
`And in a flash, the ground was kicked and I was struck with sand. `
`"Yes, you truly are like Nee-san. `
`That gaze! `
`That gaze like you're mocking me somehow. `
`Yes, I remember so many things!" `
`"......You're a sad person. `
`I'll bet that since you were young, you always got compared to Mom and scorned. `
`...And for your entire life, you'll never be released from that wretchedness." `
`"A little girl like you couldn't possibly understand. `
`...You see, your mother is a loser who threw everything away and ran away from the Sumadera family, right...? `
`Do you know how much... `
`how much trouble I went through because of that loser?!!" `
`"Any trouble you went through has nothing to do with me. `
`Sorry, but what am I supposed to do about something that happened before I was born? `
`......When will your life begin? `
`...It never will. `
`For all eternity, you'll always, always continue to be sneered at by my dead mother until you die. `
`...If only you'd just die. `
`Why are you living?" `
`"You little piss...!! `
`You all...! `
`Make her some tea." `
`"Heheheh... `
`Leave it to us..." `
`"You big-mouthed shitty brat. `
`Let us teach you a little lesson." `
`The black-suits dashed up to me, violently grabbed me by the nape of the neck, and dragged me down. `
`"Do whatever you want to her until my break is over. `
`Teach my cute niece her place." `
`Sumadera Kasumi. `
`When I think about it, she was a pitiable person. `
`To the outside world, women of the Sumadera family were trained to be in a position that supported and deferred to men. `
`...But in actuality, strong leadership was required from them, so that they could manage all the common people. `
`The role demanded of them really was that of a "female commander", like a literal reading of the word "okami" ({p:0:女将}). `
`Managing the Sumadera family with all its traditions was not something that could be accomplished with just an ordinary level of dignity. `
`It was an unimaginably heavy responsibility. `
`Normally, this would have been demanded of Kyrie. `
`Kyrie had undergone that harsh training. `
`And Kasumi, as the younger sister, should have been able to take it easy. `
`No, on the contrary, she had lived like a lazy, selfish and affluent princess, sneering at Kyrie, who had been given the heavy responsibility. `
`...However, `
`Kyrie had suddenly been disinherited. `
`She had refused the fiancé her parents had arranged...and had gotten pregnant by her lover, Ushiromiya Rudolf. `
`From the Sumaderas' perspective, even though the Ushiromiya family held a vast fortune, it was a low-level family that had already collapsed. `
`And to become not even a legal wife, but a mistress to the second son of that family... `
`Normally, a daughter of the main family would be shown no mercy for such dishonor. `
`They would wrap her up in a mat, place a pole on end, `
`and throw her either into the Pacific Ocean if the pole fell to the right or the Sea of Japan if it fell to the left. `
`......But Kyrie's punishment ended with disinheritance, an unbelievably warm-hearted decision. `
`After that, the Sumadera family began receiving favorable treatment from a section of the Ushiromiya group. `
`...There must've been some kind of backroom deal. `
`In other words, Kyrie openly left the Sumadera family under the pretense of gaining financial support from the Ushiromiya family. `
`Kasumi had watched it happen in shock. `
`No, she even disparaged her dishonorable sister as a loser. `
`...But, eventually... `
`She realized that the heavy responsibilities Kyrie had borne would be passed on to her, `
`and then, for the first time, she saw that she'd been outwitted... `
`"Because of your mother, my life was ruined. `
`...No, you could even say she killed me once. `
`On that day, I was killed once and thrown into a hellish life..." `
`"......Isn't that what you get for making light of life until then? `
`...Gyack! `
`......Gah...gah..." `
`"Don't you ever stop talking, girl?! `
`Hyaah!" `
`The black-suit punched me in the gut, and I doubled over. `
`But I was quickly grabbed by the nape of the neck and made to stand up again. `
`Kasumi cold-heartedly looked down at me, smoking a cigarette... `
`The painful days after Kyrie had left were floating through her mind. `
`Until then, she had been allowed to be a simple lady, freewheeling and naive. `
`...Only the older sister, Kyrie, had been harshly trained, and she, the younger sister, had been able to live as nothing more than a princess. `
`Then, suddenly, everything got flipped over...and her life came crashing down... `
`"My life, lifestyle, and the way I lived...were all stolen from me. `
`......Do you know how much I was derided by those relatives who didn't know the details, all because of my sister's dishonor...? `
`I detested her. `
`I detested your mother enough to make me spit blood..." `
`"Glad to hear it. `
`Keep up the good work. `
`......Graggghh!!" `
`A kick landed in Ange's side as she crawled on the ground. `
`Ange didn't stand up again. `
`...So, she continued to lie there like a caterpillar as she was kicked each time she spoke up. `
`"...I saw Nee-san at an Ushiromiya Group party once. `
`......She was with her husband, `
`......looking very happy...... `
`and laughing. `
`...She... `
`pushed everything onto me... `
`and found happiness... `
`...only for herself......" `
`"......So what? `
`How is taking it out on me going to make you happy? `
`Will taking it out on me turn back time and change history or something? `
`".........Ugugggh, `
`......gah, `
`......ghackk...!!" `
`"You said something a short while ago... `
`When will my life start? `
`......No matter how much I despise you or take out my frustrations on you, I can't turn back time. `
`...So, must I keep hating my sister even though she's gone, until I die?" `
`"You've got to be kidding me. `
`...How long will I have to be tormented by my sister's ghost? `
`So I thought of something. `
`......If I could accomplish one thing, I'd be able to forget all of my hatred and start over." `
`Ange was about to lash back out at her, but stopped. `
`...Because she'd be kicked again if she responded. `
`...Even if Kasumi didn't say any more, Ange had a pretty good idea what she meant. `
`Kasumi thought that by taking revenge against Kyrie's daughter, Ange, she'd be able to put an end to her hatred. `
`......Talk about pushing your problems onto other people. `
`"Come on, stand up. `
`If you like this island that much, I'll bury you deep in it. `
`......You don't want to die at your age, right? `
`Don't you feel like saying "Sorry my mother caused you so much trouble", or something?" `
`".........You... `
`say something like that? `
`......Gwah, `
`......ghhh...!!" `
`‘Uryu-!! `
`Ange, Angeeeeee...!!’ `
`"Ange-sama, no...! `
`You mustn't provoke them...!! `
`You should at least make it seem like you're going along with them, so you can buy some time...!" `
`".........They do say... `
`you should throw your foolish pride... `
`out with the garbage..." `
`‘Oh, what about Amakusa-san...?! `
`If Amakusa-san comes, I'm sure...!’ `
`"...It's no use, I can't see him... `
`...You idiot, Ange-sama...! `
`Why did you leave Amakusa behind...?!" `
`I didn't need Mammon to tell me. `
`...I was seriously regretting it already. `
`I walked a long way. `
`The forest was very thick. `
`...I've got no doubts that signs of activity here won't reach the boat... `
`During the time it took for Kasumi to finish casually smoking a whole cigarette, `
`I was continuously tormented by the black-suits, as she had told them to. `
`The moment I grabbed at my head, my scalp was kicked by someone at a bad angle, and my head was filled with stars... `
`The feeling of stars flickering in this gray, twisted world... `
`was one I remembered clearly. `
`My life was very similar to the one Sumadera Kasumi led. `
`...After all, as the Successor to the Ushiromiya family, I was tormented constantly with various kinds of bullying...under the guise of education and training. `
`Yes. `
`Having the inside of my head filled with stars like this...is a feeling I know well. `
`When being reprimanded for some error in manners I seemed to have made, `
`the discussion always turned to whether I was fitting to be the Successor or not. `
`...On and on about the honor of the Ushiromiya family, and how deep that was. `
`...By the time the conversation reached that point, `
`I'd forget what mistake I was being blamed for in the first place. `
`No, in fact, it was the same for Aunt Eva. `
`After all, sometimes she'd ask herself "Umm, what was it again?" `
`...But in the end, she wouldn't be able to remember, and would say something like... `
`"If I'm angry, it must be your fault, Ange. `
`The fact that you're at fault is what matters, so who cares if I can't remember what it was you did." `
`...There'd be some ridiculous reasoning like that, and then she'd keep on punishing me. `
`Yes. `
`Aunt Eva's punishment wasn't something that would continue until I learned something, or acknowledged my mistake, or apologized. `
`......It would continue until Aunt Eva wanted to stop. `
`So this violence was a bit nostalgic, in a way that made me want to vomit. `
`...I opened my eyes...and look, there's Aunt Eva. `
`Right next to Kasumi, who's smoking a cigarette, `
`I can see Aunt Eva, almost as though the two of them are laughing together. `
`When I think about it, even Aunt Eva's life might be a thing worthy of my sympathy. `
`...The responsibility and pressure of being a member of the Ushiromiya family, which she often mentioned to me, `
`had probably caused her great pain. `
`After all, people can't make insults that they've never been the targets of themselves... `
`It was probably the same for Aunt Rosa as well. `
`...As the youngest child of the honorable Ushiromiya family, she must've gone through many tough times. `
`So, it was just like what Aunt Eva did to me... `
`Just like what Sumadera Kasumi is doing now... `
`...Aunt Rosa...must have been the same. `
`People tend to push the pain they're burdened with onto other people. `
`Otherwise, they can never escape from that pain. `
`...So on and on, in eternity and perpetuity, the chain of pain and sadness does not end. `
`That is the reason............Maria onee‐chan's magic was... `
`so incredible. `
`With her magic, ...she didn't have to bear the pain caused by Aunt Rosa. `
`The pain probably was pushed onto her. `
`Its weight probably tormented her. `
`...But Onee-chan didn't carry that burden on her own shoulders. `
`......She purified it...and filled her world with happiness. `
`So I'm sure... `
`...If Maria onee-chan had had children in the future... `
`She probably wouldn't have pushed the pain that had been forced on her onto her children. `
`...That chain of pain and sadness that stretched back for who knows how long, `
`which she couldn't understand and which she had inherited, which had been forced onto her... `
`......Maria onee-chan cut it with her magic. `
`"......Whaaat's wrong? `
`Got a bone to pick with me?" `
`In the past, I would have snapped back. `
`...I would've met her hatred with hatred, so that they'd cancel each other out. `
`...No, nothing got cancelled out. `
`The thing being forced on me ended up right there on my shoulders. `
`Just like how even now, ...I hate her. `
`So, now that I... `
`...know of magic, `
`...I'll look at the human called Ushiromiya Eva again. `
`......What I could see through to... `
`...was a sad human form, no different from me, who had lost her family and who bore deep wounds in her heart. `
`Unable to withstand the pain of that torn heart, `
`she was doing nothing more than howl sadly, like a lion crying in pain, ...like a child. `
`...Even Ushiromiya Eva was someone I should have felt compassion for. `
`She needed someone to understand the difficulties and pain of her childhood years. `
`......Even she, who was the only survivor of the Rokkenjima crime, `
`who was faced with the curiosity of all of society, who was publicly slandered and forced to have salt continually flung into the wound, `
`had needed someone's compassion. `
`In order to let Eva forget her pain and sadness at least a little, `
`......the black witch...taught her magic, just like the times it had possessed Aunt Rosa. `
`It was the same magic of anger and sadness... `
`that {f:5:Beatrice} had taught Maria onee-chan when she was mourning for her torn-apart friend, Sakutarou. `
`...That same magic...that witch...had probably dwelled inside Aunt Rosa too. `
`......So I mustn't hate Ushiromiya Eva. `
`...Maybe... `
`...I should've become her ally, `
`as the only person in the world who could understand her. `
`...What did I say to her when I was young, when she returned alive all alone...? `
`Could it be... `
`...that I acted... `
`...as though she'd killed my family and returned on her own...? `
`............ `
`...I can't believe it. `
`...Aunt Eva, who has never been more than a object of and a synonym for hatred throughout my life, `
`......is turning into...a "human" I can understand... `
`So, `
`......I can see, right next to Aunt Eva, ...the form of the black witch, who taught her the black magic... `
`Aunt Eva...was crying. `
`It was only natural. `
`......Not only was no one willing to understand the pain of losing her husband and son at once, `
`...but her only relative had insulted her, ...saying "Give me back my Dad and Mom". `
`......I can make the excuse that I was merciless because of my youth. `
`...However, ...to her at the time, `
`it had probably been cruel enough to sever the last thread in her heart. `
`.........In the following days, the talk shows and magazines publicly slandered her. `
`The truth of her husband's business and character...and even her beloved son were negated. `
`She no longer had anything left. `
`She could do nothing but cry and howl, ...trying to forget the pain and sadness at least for a while. `
`After all, she could only feel a tiny bit of release, and only during the time that she howled. `
`And so, ......the black witch taught her how to howl. `
`The one I hated...was the black witch. `
`Black magic can probably release one from that pain for an instant. `
`...However, `
`it never lifts that weight from a person's shoulders. `
`On the contrary, it forces that weight onto further victims, `
`......filling the world with hatred. `
`......If only Aunt Eva knew of white magic...and had a true witch nearby... `
`...Shouldn't that... `
`...have been... `
`...me......? `
`Didn't I learn the magic to create happiness from Maria onee-chan? `
`......If I'd taught her...with that magic, `
`......could we have... `
`...built a future with a completely different relationship? `
`Up until now, `
`......I've hated Aunt Eva constantly. `
`...So I didn't notice the black witch beside her. `
`...Without love, it could not be "seen". `
`I didn't... `
`...have any love for her... `
`So now, finally... `
`......I'll glare at the black witch, `
`...the one I truly should hate. `
`"...Oh. `
`......Whaat's this? `
`You can "see" me? `
`Hehheheheheh...!" `
`".........I "see" you. `
`...The one I should've hated wasn't Aunt Eva. `
`...It's you." `
`"Whoa, awesome. `
`To think that a lowly Human could "see" a witch like me. `
`...So? `
`Are you trying to say something with that glare? `
`Do you hate me?" `
`"......Hate? `
`...Yes, I do. `
`...But...that's not quite it. `
`...I just think you're sad." `
`"Sad? `
` `
`...*giggle*giggle* Ahhahahahahaha! `
`What're you saying?! Come on, go ahead! `
`Why not hate me as much as you waant?!" `
`"...I won't hate. `
`Hating you... `
`...means I'm doing nothing more than inheriting Aunt Eva's hatred. `
`...I'll put a stop to hatred. `
`...I'll accept Aunt Eva's pain, ......purify it, and throw it away." `
`"Ahhahahahahahahaha!! `
`What kind of epiphany do you think you've had? `
`Is your head all right? `
`Seriously, if only you'd just give up and diie! `
`Kyaahhahhahahahahahaha! `
`You guys, kick her more and more, okay? `
`Not her face, though. `
`'Cause it'd be boring if her pitiful face got any better!" `
`"Guhhkk! `
`......Gwah!! `
`......Nngg..." `
`The black-suits persistently kicked my stomach and back. `
`...As though they had been ordered to by the black witch. `
`"...My, my, are you still not suffering after all that...? `
`......You keep staring right at me. `
`Do you hate me? `
`I'll bet you do. `
`Same here. `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*..." `
`Kasumi sneered at me. `
`...But for some reason, I had the feeling that she was crying behind that expression. `
`Just like me, the pain of being forced into an unreasonable life would never, ever heal. `
`...The sad lion gasping in pain from the thorn he can't get out continues to howl... `
`"Hey, Sumadera Kasumi, take a look. `
`Over there, it's you as you used to be. `
`...Don't you feel better now? `
`You used to be standing there, but now you're on this side, right? `
`Heheheh, isn't it great? `
`Don't you like having the roles switched?!" `
`"...............Yes, it truly does feel... `
`...great...... `
`Ahhahahahaha, how can you make that kind of face, Ange...?! `
`Go on and cry, you want to, right?!" `
`"Kyahhahahahahahaha!! `
`Yes, yes, of course she wants to cry! `
`Make her cry. `
`Didn't someone make you cry back then? `
`So make her cry too. `
`*giggle* You too, Ange. `
`If only you'd just break down and cry! `
`Kyaaahhahhahhahhahha!!" `
`"...Aha, ...ahahahahahahaha!! `
`Cry, Angee! `
`I want to see your crying face! `
`Cry, and try saying "I'm sorry, Aunt Kasumi"...!!" `
`"Yes, make her say those words. `
`...Aren't those words painful? `
`Isn't being made to apologize for something that isn't your fault...just the worst pain...? `
`Make her feel the same way... `
`By doing that, you can relieve your pain. `
`...Hehheheheh, yeah, that's it. `
`Be a little more honest with yourself, okay? `
`If only you'd just let your emotions run free more, and more, and mooooooooooore!" `
`...The black witch provoked Kasumi. `
`And Kasumi began to give herself over to that dark emotion. `
`...By turning deep sadness into an evil alcohol and forcing it down, trying to forget it for just an instant, `
`nothing would change. `
`The words Kasumi insulted me with... `
`...were themselves... `
`sad. `
`And, I couldn't forgive the black witch who had imposed that sadness on Kasumi...... `
`......I had gone limp, which seemed to have stopped the black-suits' kicking competition. `
`...Or maybe the kickers were getting tired too. `
`Kasumi didn't order them to stop, but at some point, they did. `
`However, I was reflected in Kasumi's eyes, and they burned me with flames of hatred. `
`...She had been tempted by the witch to do that in order to relieve her own pain. `
`"......Sumadera Kasumi, `
`you aren't done yet. `
`You've got much more trampling to do, right? `
`Can you forgive what happened to your entire life with just a little violence?" `
`"...I can't. `
`...I still can't forgive her with just this." `
`"Right? `
`There's no way you can forgive her! `
`Do it more! `
`More of the flames of hatred! `
`Nothing can warm you except the fires of hate. `
`After being frozen in the snow fields of anger and sadness, the only flame that can warm you is hatred...!! `
`Say it, okay? `
`Scream it!! `
`If only you'd just burn yourself to ashes with a roar of haaaaaaaaaate!" `
`"...U-Ushiromiya Angeeeeeeeee!! `
`I cannot live...without hating you!! `
`Hehhehehehahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!" `
`"Sumadera Kasumi, look at that bundle of flowers. `
`......These flowers are for your dead family, right, Ange?" `
`The black witch grinned at me unpleasantly, using her chin to signal Kasumi to pick it up. `
`Kasumi picked up the flowers I was going to offer, `
`......brought them all the way over to me, dropped them, and made a show of trampling them... `
`Her expression was filled with hatred...and a frantic quality that couldn't be explained with hatred alone. `
`...She trampled them over and over again as though her sadness was reaching the bursting point. `
`So the sound of her trampling it was just sad. `
`"......Oh, still not suffering yet? `
`Then what about this? `
`Sumadera Kasumi! `
`Use this." `
`"...N-No, `
`...not that......" `
`The object the black witch pointed at......was Maria onee-chan's grimoire. `
`Kasumi also noticed it...and picked up that book, which was heavier than it looked... `
`"Whaat's this?" `
`"*giggle* `
`...Why not read it? `
`Eheheh, you might fall over laughing, okay?" `
`Kasumi opened the grimoire, `
`...skimmed over the contents, and snorted derisively. `
`"Give it back... `
`...That's...Onee-chan's......" `
`Of course, my hand couldn't reach. `
`...My stomach was once again kicked by the black-suits, and I doubled over... `
`"See? `
`This book's really important to Ange, right? `
`Gotta belittle the things that are important to her, okay? `
`That'll work better than punching or kicking for a girl like her. `
`...You know that better than anyone, don't you...?" `
`As though remembering something painful, Kasumi's face twisted for an instant. `
`...But that quickly disappeared, changing into a scornful smile directed at me. `
`"*giggle*giggle* `
`Whew, what a creepy book. `
`...Did you write this......?" `
`"...Stop it, ...give it back......" `
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*!! `
`Look at that face...! `
`Belittle it more, belittle it more...! `
`Teach her the pain of having your dignity trampled, that's the only way to soften your own pain...!" `
`"Heh, heheheheh, what's with this embarrassing book...? `
`......I'll admit I did have a little interest in fortune telling as a girl." `
`"But isn't this going a bit too far? `
`Magic? Ew. `
`...You're one of those, aren't you? `
`It's like in those cartoons, where a girl says that something-somethiiiing spell and transforms into a witch, right? `
`You like those, don't you? `
`......How pathetic. `
`*giggle*giggle*." `
`Cackling, Kasumi opened to a random page and showed it to the black-suits. `
`The black-suits looked too and guffawed. `
`That sneer didn't wound me. `
`...But I couldn't forgive it. `
`...After all, that sneer was ridiculing Maria onee-chan. `
`I don't hate Kasumi. `
`...But for forcing that unhealing anger and sadness on Kasumi, ...I cannot forgive the black witch... `
`That black witch ate into Aunt Eva, Sumadera Kasumi, and Aunt Rosa, `
`...tormenting them for an eternity without letting their wounds be healed. `
`......I can't forgive her... `
`...I can't forgive......the black witch... `
`"Wow, this is just great...! `
`...Magic for making candy fall from the sky, ...you say?!! `
`Ahhahahahaha...! `
`What's this? `
`Sprinkle water cleansed by the sun with sugar...? `
`Stick the magic staff in, and then an incantation, ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ahhahahahahahahahaha!! `
`What the hell?! `
`Ahhahahahahahahaha...!! `
`It huuuuuuuurts!!" `
`The black-suits were also rolling around, guffawing. `
`Then, grinning, the black witch whispered something into Kasumi's ear. `
`...After glaring at me with a grin, ...Kasumi took that page- `
`"...Ah..." `
`Kasumi grabbed hold of that page, tore it off, crumpled it up, ...and threw it away... `
`‘...S-So cruel. ...That was...Maria's magic......’ `
`"Oh, really? `
`Heheh, how sad." `
`...It was one of the spells to summon happiness... `
`that Maria had made with Sakutarou. `
`Anyone knows that making sugar water, coloring it, and leaving it by the window... `
`isn't going to make candy fall from the sky. `
`But after repeating that every day, ...one time on her way home from school... `
`She had found several pieces of candy scattered around... `
`......How happy must that miracle have made Maria onee-chan? `
`...Didn't she treasure that candy, eating it during her night alone with Sakutarou to distract herself from her loneliness? `
`That......magic which Onee‐chan had created... `
`...had been torn and thrown away... `
`and had disappeared... `
`The whole miracle of happiness that magic had given birth to... `
`had been torn and thrown away... `
`"Oh, this part's great too...! `
`Magic to make tonight's dinner cream croquette? `
`Ahhahahahahaha!! `
`...What's next? `
`Magic to make bell peppers taste good? `
`Heh, that's not bad either, so stupid! `
`Ahhahhahhahha...!!" `
`"Tear that too. `
`Eheheh!! `
`If only you'd just tear it more and moooooooore!!" `
`With a brutal, loud laugh, `
`...the black witch made Maria onee-chan's spells get torn out one after another... `
`She...sneered at that happy magic, `
`...tore it apart, `
`...and threw it away... `
`"Stop it, ...stop it...!! `
`Don't...defile Lady {f:5:Maria}'s magic...!! `
`Don't defile it...with your filthy toxin...!!" `
`Mammon cried and yelled, ...but she had no way of reaching Kasumi. `
`"Come on, why not defile it?! `
`Miracles of magic? `
`Magic to bring happiness? `
`No way, nothing like that exists! `
`Don't you know that you can't heal pain and sadness without pushing it onto someone else? `
`...Hey, you also had those magic friend things, right?" `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*! `
`Sumadera Kasumi, open to that page." `
`"What's this? `
`Magic friends? `
`......The Seven Sisters of Purgatory? `
`Aha, what a creepy name! `
`*giggle* It says they can fly at awesome speeds and finish off the enemy. `
`Ahhaha, Ange, if you can use this kind of magic, shouldn't you use it right now? `
`......Ahhahahahaha. `
`Foolish!" `
`The page that wrote of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory was also heartlessly torn away. `
`...The page itself was just paper. `
`It wasn't Mammon's vessel or anything. `
`But the tearing, denying toxin burned Mammon from the inside... `
`Mammon's face twisted from that heat and pain... `
`"......Gah, .........ack, ......" `
`‘Are you okay, Mammon?! `
`Hold on...!!’ `
`"...This much is...no problem... `
`...It's not me, ...but Ange-sama......who's in pain......" `
`However, Mammon's expression was twisted with unbearable anguish and humiliation... `
`‘Stop it, black witch...!! `
`Why are you doing something like this?! `
`Why...can't you use magic for happiness?!!’ `
`"...Oh, you're a magic friend too, right? `
`*giggle* I'll defile you too. `
`Sumadera Kasumi, look for this guy's page too, okay?" `
`"What's this one? `
`What's with this crappy scribble of a lion? `
`...Sakutarou? `
`What a weird name! `
`My best friend, it says. `
`Really? `
`This is your friend? A close friend? `
`This lion is? Is it, is it?" `
`"Ahhahahahahahaha!! `
`It really is a crappy scribble. `
`This ugly lion is totally you." `
`"To think she had something like this as a friend... That Ushiromiya Maria kid's mind is so pathetic it's embarassing, what a joooke. `
`......She's like, a moron. `
`If only she'd just give up...and diiiiiiiieee...!" `
`‘U...ryu... `
`......Don't make fun...of Maria...’ `
`".........St...op...it...... `
`...Don't break it......" `
`""No waay."" `
`There was a shrill sound. `
`......The page had been filthily ripped out... `
`The picture of Sakutarou... `
`that Onee-chan had drawn... `
`was violently ripped in half...... `
`"What a crappy pictuuuure. `
`Kyahhahahahahahahahahahaha...!" `
`"You all laugh too, okay? `
`Ahhahahahahahahaha...!" `
`A pair of the black-suits laughed vulgarly... `
`and heartlessly trampled the two halves that had been torn and thrown away... `
`‘Uuuuuuuuuuuu, ...hic! `
`...Uuuuuuuuuuu...’ `
`"...Sakutaro, ...hang in there......" `
`‘I'm...not sad... `
`...I just...can't stand it... `
`...I can't stand that... `
`...Maria's being made fun of, `
`and I can't do anything about it...’ `
`"......... `
`...To Humans who can't "see" us, ......it's as though we don't exist... `
`...We can only interact with Humans that need us. `
`......That's why......we're furniture......" `
`As Sakutarou and Mammon...supported each other, `
`...they crouched down, ...sobbing... `
`I couldn't stand it either... `
`...Those who can't "see" how wonderful the world of magic is...can't understand it. `
`You can't explain to humans who can't understand. `
`So it gets belittled. `
`......If you could show them it... `
`...But you can't... `
`Because, in front of Humans who are filled with the magic-resisting toxin and who can't understand magic, `
`magic cannot be used... `
`"I really don't get it. `
`From this delusional diary, I've got to assume that something's wrong with your head. `
`...It really is fun to take a peek into your mind. `
`You creepy child." `
`"Both you and Maria. `
`...And that stuffed animal and the furniture over there too, right? `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*!! `
`Ahhahahahahahahahahaha!" `
`"Aah, I could laugh. `
`You don't have any friends, do you? `
`You're aaalways all alone, so stuffed animals are your friends? `
`What a pitiable child. `
`Heheheheheheheheh...! `
`Don't worry, I understand. `
`I know what it's like to live that way. `
`......So I'll accept it. `
`You really are a pitiable child, right? `
`Ehhehehhahahahahahahaha!" `
`......To you, it probably would look... `
`...like something made by a pitiful child. `
`That's right. `
`If a hundred people were to read Onee-chan's diary, a hundred people would probably think the same thing. `
`...I used to be like that too. `
`But you know, `
`......despite all of that, `
`...Maria onee-chan... `
`...summoned a world of happiness. `
`......Don't deny... `
`...that magic, ...that happiness... `
`"Such a stubborn child, you are. `
`...Very well. `
`This is the last one. `
`I'll tear apart the source of the truly foolish magic that you and Maria believed in. `
`Sumadera Kasumi, read this page, okay?" `
`"Hmmm, what's this colorful page...? `
`...What's this? `
`......Magic to... `
`...always be friends with my beloved mother...?" `
`‘St-Stop iiiiiiiiiiit!! `
`Not that page...!!’ `
`"Aha. `
`This magic's really simple, isn't it? `
`It looks like even I could do it. `
`......Even I could remember an incantation this short. `
`Shall I give it a whirl?" `
`"*giggle*giggle* It really is a short incantation, isn't it? `
`Okay, give it a try, let's have everyone spit it out!" `
`With expressions that ridiculed it from the bottom of their hearts, the black witch and Kasumi...tapered their mouths. `
`......And they said it aloud... `
`"Uu-uu-." `
`The black-suits stared blankly, asking what the hell that was supposed to be. `
`Then Kasumi answered, cackling. `
`"This is supposed to be an incantation. `
`Are you kidding me...?! `
`Ahhahahahahahaha...!!!" `
`"Come on, why don't you guys try it too? `
`Uu-uu-uu-." `
`The black-suits imitated that moaning voice, making fun of it... `
`————"Uu-uu-." `
`That was the incantation...for the magic that would let her always be friends with her beloved mother. `
`"What the hell, how stupid...!! `
`If you could make family relationships better just by saying uu-uu-, the world would always be peaceful. `
`Ahahahahaha!!" `
`"Uu-uu-uu-! `
`A stupid moaning voice! `
`Too bad that if you do this over and over again, people'll think you're a pathetic, stupid kid! `
`Are you a moron?! `
`Wahhahahahahaha, waaahahahahahahha!!" `
`‘Stop iiiit... At least don't belittle...that magiiiiiiiic...’ `
`......It was the day of a picnic, when Maria onee-chan and Aunt Rosa were alone... `
`It was written that this was one of the top five happiest days of her life. `
`Onee-chan was singing a song she'd just learned from her Mama. `
`...Her mother had been delighted. `
`But partway through, Maria forgot the lyrics. `
`But, since she saw that her mother was so happy, she tried to sing until the very end. `
`With "uu-uu-uu-". `
`...Even though she'd only pretended to know the lyrics, her mother had enjoyed it a lot... `
`After that, "uu-" remained as an incantation to remember that day she'd spent in fun and happiness with her mother. `
`Of course, even though she seemed to find it funny at first, Aunt Rosa eventually tired of hearing it, `
`and eventually started scolding Onee-chan when she said it, `
`...but to Onee-chan, it was a memory of a fun day that she'd never forget... `
`So among the spells that Maria had created, it was the oldest and the first... `
`Kasumi stuck her fingernails into that page too... `
`"...Stop it, `
`......don't tear it... `
`At least spare... `
`...that page......" `
`"Hahahahahahahahaha! `
`No waay!!" `
`............With a shrill sound, a girl's world of happiness... `
`was... `
`erased. `
`"Uu-uu-uu-! `
`Aaaahhahhahhahhahha, aaaaahahahhahahah!! `
`Is this your magic of happiness? `
`Hilarious, hilarious...!!" `
`"There's no way there could be magic to make you happy, right?! `
`Magic is made out of anger and hatred, right?" `
`"Happiness is what you call the feeling of release you get only when you've pushed all the hatred you bear onto other people. `
`The happiness you all are talking about is a phantom that doesn't show up outside picture books!!" `
`As Kasumi laughed her head off, she slammed the grimoire against the ground and stepped on it. `
`"Can't stand it? `
`Hey, you can't stand it, right?! `
`You white witches of happiness? `
`If you can't stand it that much, why don't you show us?! `
`Show us your magic!! `
`If it exists, then you just have to show us, riiiiight? `
`......A witch who can't use magic isn't a witch!! `
`That's why we're the real witches. `
`You're just brats trying to escape reality with a dream!!" `
`...............Then, `
`...if I can show you magic, `
`...will you... believe in Onee-chan's magic......? `
`"Huh? `
`Kyahhahahaha, yeah, sure!! `
`I'll believe! `
`If you can use magic and show me, that is!! `
`Let's see it, you stupid braaaaaaaaaaaat!!" `
`............ `
`...... `
`Silently, slowly, `
`...I stood up. `
`...Sensations of this cramped world, such as the pain in my body, felt truly trifling... `
`"Oh, looks like you've still got enough energy to stand up, Miss Great Witch. `
`*giggle*giggle*!" `
`"Now that you've stood up, what are you going to show us? `
`Show us some magiic...!" `
`"......Magic...exists." `
`"Whaat? `
`What's this kid saying...?! `
`Did you guys hear that?!" `
`"Silence!!! `
`......Heh, isn't that interesting. `
`...You people always refuse to show this power of miracles because of the magic-resisting toxin. `
`......Disciple of the white witch, {f:5:Maria}, `
`let's see some magic...!!" `
`"........." `
`"...Do you have any clue how many humans have believed in that miracle before being betrayed? `
`......*giggle* `
`Everyone believes! `
`Everyone is betrayed and despairs! `
`And they learn that true magic can only be gained by the power of black witches, like me...!!" `
`"......Hitting someone with your hatred is nothing more than a sin. `
`That isn't magic. `
`......I'll show you real magic." `
`"......Y-You........." `
`The black witch winced slightly. `
`However, Kasumi sneered at me even more. `
`"Then let's have a look. `
`So, what kind of magic will you show us? `
`Magic to make candy fall from the sky? `
`Or else magic to make cookies multiply? `
`......Whaaat?!" `
`The instant I opened my eyes, a tremendous wind arose. `
`"...Wh-What is this, all of a sudden......?!" `
`"Come, arise, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory." `
`"......Whaaat...?" `
`There was a flash behind me, and in an instant, seven pieces of high-level furniture were gathered there. `
`It was a power that far surpassed the magical strength I'd had in my prime. `
`It was a power that matched even Maria onee-chan and {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`"The Seven Sisters of Purgatory, right here...!!" `
`"...A-Ange-sama...!" `
`"You said it once. `
`......Because I lacked magical power and resolve, `
`...I couldn't use you or your sisters. `
`...This isn't some cheap emotion, like wanting to get back at my bullying classmates." `
`"...In order to protect Maria onee-chan's......Mariage Sorcière's world, `
`...I now order you to show me the miracle of magic." `
`"I-It's impossible... `
`No matter what you try, before such a mass of toxin......" `
`The Seven Sisters also remembered what had happened in that classroom. `
`...If they could have obeyed Ange's order, they would have. `
`...However, ...surrounded by the toxin that runs thick in Humans, they hadn't been able to display the miracle of magic. `
`...And they remembered very well how deeply that had hurt Ange... `
`But Ange spoke very quietly. `
`"In that case, `
`you all believe too." `
`"...Huh?" `
`"......Mariage Sorcière was created to bring people happiness. `
`...And also to fight the black witch." `
`"In order to show that miracle to the foolish black witch, `
`...who denies the world that one of the founders, the Witch of Origins Lady {f:5:Maria}, gave birth to, `
`...and in order to protect that world, `
`......believe. `
`In magic. `
`In witches. `
`In miracles, right now...!" `
`When Kasumi gave an order to the black-suits, one of them took out a gun and pointed it at Ange. `
`"You'll show us magic, right? `
`Then let's have it. `
`Use magic to shoot this man down with a fireball or lightning or something. `
`You get one chance. `
`......Show us before I count to three, got it? `
`If you can't, then you'd best prepare yourself, okay? `
`Ehheheheheh!" `
`"............ `
`.........Shoot." `
`"What's with this kid? `
`Hehheheh, she's lost it." `
`The black-suit pointing the gun laughed at Ange's detached attitude. `
`"Ahhahahahahaha!! `
`Are you serious?! `
`This girl's lost her mind! `
`In that case, get yourself shot! If only you'd just diiiiiiiiiiiiie!" `
`‘Ange...!! `
`...I-It's impossible! `
`You can't block bullets with magic...!!’ `
`"No. `
`There's nothing to be afraid of. `
`......Compared to my magic, to the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, bullets are nothing." `
`"A-Ange-sama......" `
`Mammon was perplexed by Ange's absolute trust. `
`...If she could comply, she would have. `
`On that day as well. `
`But, ...because she had been unable to do anything, she had hurt Ange...... `
`"Hehheheh, you brat. `
`If you can use magic, let us have a look right now." `
`"What's wrong? `
`We're tellin' you to show us magic, right?!!" `
`"Come on, no need to hold back, okay? `
`*booom*! `
`Show me some magic!! `
`Hihhehhehheh!" `
`The black-suits jeered at her. `
`But Ange simply concentrated her mind in silence... `
`"If only you'd just shoot! `
`She's even telling you to try and shoot, you guys!" `
`"...This kid's already lost her mind from fear. `
`Bye-bye, Ange-chan. `
`...Go and pretend to be a witch as much as you want in heaven. `
`...Fire." `
`"Heheh, you sure?" `
`"Fire! `
`Die, Ange!!" `
`"If you can do it, then give this magic of yours a try!!!" `
`The black-suit cocked the gun, and sneering...pulled the trigger. `
`"............" `
`The sound of gunfire rang out, `
`...and the world...stopped. `
`A red spray scattered out... `
`...and chunks of flesh flew. `
`"...Huh, ......ah..." `
`"What are you doing, Mammon? `
`...Don't tell me you'd let a boorish pebble of a bullet like this reach Ange-sama." `
`Lucifer lined up the bullet perfectly, and with a single swing, ...sliced it... `
`And, ...in the chest of the black-suit who had apparently fired the gun, ...was a hole as big as a fist... `
`"......Every now and then, `
`I get to go first." `
`Half of Leviathan's body was covered with blood, and a cold smile was on her face. `
`...Then, slowly, ......the pitiful prey that she had brought down...fell over. `
`"...Y-You pierced...a Human...!!!" `
`"Idiot! `
`Do you still not believe?! `
`In our master's magic power...?!!" `
`"Are...you...kidding me......?!?! `
`Y-You materialized...in front of this many Humans?!?!" `
`"...Wh-What is this? ...What?!" `
`Kasumi and the rest were flustered... `
`He certainly seemed to have fired his gun... `
`{n}However, `
`...it hadn't hit Ange, `
`......and why... `
`...was the person who fired... `
`hurt instead...?! `
`"...This is...magic. `
`...Great job, Leviathan." `
`"I'm most honored...!! `
`You foolish Humans who dare oppose our master! `
`Now is the time of judgement! Prostrate yourselves!!" `
`"Wh-Why...?!!! `
`You shouldn't be able to bring magic into the world of Humans...!! `
`They shouldn't be able to "see" magic, and they shouldn't be able to be touched by magic!! `
`...Why?!!" `
`"......Because this...is true magic." `
`"...Gah, ...aaaaaaaaaaarrrggggg...!!" `
`"Wh-What are you people doing?! `
`K-Kill, kill!!!" `
`One of the black‐suits who had finally come to his senses pulled his gun, aimed, `
`"Like I'd allow you the disrespect of pointing a gun barrel at our master...! `
`Die." `
`Those words were a requiem. `
`...The man's chest had already been pierced by Lucifer, who had become the Stake of Pride in an instant. `
`*thump*! `
`With the sound of the second person falling, the black-suits now realized for certain that their lives were in peril...!! `
`"W-Waaaaaaaah, s-s-save me...!!!" `
`The instant one of the black suits doubled over in shock...and turned on his heels to escape from that place, `
`...the Stake of Sloth... `
`"......Be thankful that your violence against our master will be repaid with this alone. `
`Die!!" `
`In his right eye, a hole as big as a walnut opened, and his head split. `
`Belphegor was sprayed with blood, and her face twisted demonically with the joy at being able to use her full power...! `
`"Ooh, waaaaaaahhh?! `
`Who's that?! `
`Who's there?! `
`Where are you?!" `
`The black-suits were flustered, pointing their guns in every direction. `
`But they didn't understand what was happening. `
`They knew that something terrifying was coming for them from somewhere, `
`but they didn't know where...!! `
`"Dumbass! `
`Th-The enemy is right before your eyes! `
`The witch's furniture is after you!!!" `
`But they couldn't "see"...!! `
`Because they didn't believe in magic, they could not "see"...!! `
`Just as the black witch said, Satan was standing boldly right in front of a black-suit. `
`However, the black-suit couldn't "see" her at all...! `
`"*giggle*...! `
`Did you think Humans could see our forms? `
`That they could follow us? `
`Ahhahahahahahaha, stupid Humans!! `
`Time to pay a fool's price for forgetting your awe of magic!!" `
`"Eee, eeeeeeeeeeeekk!!! `
`What is this?! `
`What's going on?!" `
`"......You can't "see" it. `
`Because you have no love." `
`"...Impossible!! `
`Even though there are so many Humans here, even though the magic-resisting toxin is everywhere, ...why can you manifest your magic?! `
`Who...are you?!?!" `
`"......A witch. `
`And unlike you, a real one." `
`"Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaat, damn iiiiiiit, you biiiiiiiitch!!" `
`As though announcing his candidacy for becoming the fourth victim, one of the black-suits pointed his gun at Ange. `
`...And the trigger was... `
`Ange glared at him coldly...and simply ordered. `
`"D-Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeee!!" `
`"Next one. `
`Satan." `
`"Satan of Wrath, already right here!! `
`Blockhead!! `
`You think a simple bullet could hit Ange-sama or us now?!!!" `
`The Stake of Anger...pierced and smashed the bullet fired by the black-suit... `
`and continued straight on, towards the man's face- `
`"......Know your foolishness...and regret in hell!! `
`Die!!" `
`With a terrible explosive sound, the upper half of the man's head was smashed. `
`Bathed in scattered flesh and blood, Ange quietly asked one more question. `
`"...Hey, Aunt Kasumi. `
`......Do you still... `
`not feel like believing in magic?" `
`"Th‐ `
`There's no way...something so ridiculous... `
`could exist...!! `
`I-I won't accept it...!! `
`There's no way magic exists...!!!" `
`"Yes, that's right... `
`There's no way magic exists...!! `
`There's no way witches exist!!" `
`‘...M-Magic exists!! `
`Witches exist...!! Uryu-!!’ `
`"......That's right. `
`Magic exists. `
`Witches exist. `
`...And, in this world filled with anger and sadness, it can become the key that opens the door to the world of happiness...!! `
`I won't let...someone like you deny that!!" `
`‘The key to a world of happiness lies in every person's hands...! `
`No one...has any right to steal that away...!!’ `
`"You pitiful Human who cannot understand this. `
`......If there had been magic in your life, it would probably have turned out differently, becoming much more peaceful." `
`"When I think that in your entire life, you were never able to meet with a true witch, `
`...I pity you." `
`"Eee, ...eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekkk!!!" `
`Kasumi let out a piercing scream. `
`At the same time, two of the black-suits came for me at once, thrusting their guns at my head. `
`...Like they were trying to use me as a hostage against something their eyes couldn't "see". `
`...Against the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, who had now reached the level of weapons, this was completely pointless. `
`"Damn, where are you?! `
`Keep on attacking, and this bitch is dead!! `
`Show yourself!!" `
`"Kyahhahahahahahaha!!! `
`What the hell's he sayin'?! And his guts look so tasty too. `
`......Ange-sama, leave the next one to me!" `
`"Go ahead. Kill him." `
`"Thank you so much!! I'm so happyyyyyy!! `
`Diiiiiee!!!" `
`The man's chest split, and his guts poured out. `
`...This terrible way of dying threw the other man into a total panic. `
`However, Asmodeus's form was already at his back, `
`grasping his neck...and smiling obscenely... `
`"What a cutie. `
`...Hey, hey, where do you wanna get pierced? `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* Ange-sama, got any ideas?!!!" `
`"The head." `
`"Certainly, my masteer!! `
`Die!!" `
`The final black-suit had his head smashed by the Stake of Lust, `
`and as his insides scattered, he twisted and fell. `
`In the gruesome world where six people lay in a sea of blood, `
`......witch and Human confronted each other. `
`"......Sumadera Kasumi. `
`I sympathize with your sad life from the bottom of my soul. `
`...I'm willing to grant you magic that can seal up that unfillable hole in your heart. `
`If you can believe, that is." `
`"D-Don't be...ridiculous...!! `
`I-I...will never accept something like this!! `
`Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekk!!" `
`As Kasumi, who was scared out of her wits, stepped backwards, `
`...she picked up a handgun that someone had dropped. `
`Then, shaking, she pointed it at Ange... `
`"That's right, Kasumi...! `
`Shoot with that gun...!! `
`Turn your hatred into a bullet and shoot...!!" `
`"Eeek, eeek...!! `
`I'll kill you... I'll kill you...!! `
`If I don't kill you, I'll never be paid back for the life I've lived...!!" `
`"Yes, kill! `
`Pull the trigger!! `
`Take all of the anger and pain from your shabby life until now! `
`Use it all against her!" `
`"If you don't, you won't be released from your pain and anguish!!" `
`"......Stop it, Aunt Kasumi. `
`...You mustn't listen to the black witch." `
`"I'll kill you...... I'll kill you......! `
`Because of your mother, `
`...my entire life... `
`...has been a wreck...!!" `
`"In that case, my magic might be able to turn that life into something bright and peaceful, bit by bit, starting now. `
`If you can believe in magic...and just have a change of heart, `
`I'll be able to open the door to a new world for you." `
`"There's no such thing!! `
`The salvation she speaks of is obviously just some fairy tale! `
`Your life is gonna be covered with thorns until you die anyway...!! `
`Let her hear that cry of agony!! `
`You can't regain anything that was lost, ...right? Sumadera Kasumiiiiiiiiii?!?!" `
`"That's right, you might not be able to regain anything. `
`However, I know you'll be able to create something new. `
`So, Aunt Kasumi, `
`throw that gun away. `
`......I might be able to teach you too...about a world of happiness." `
`"Hiee... `
`...eeeeeeeeeekk...!! `
`Y `
`......You know, `
`because your mother ran away, `
`......I was forced to marry her fiancé in her place...!!" `
`"There was a man I swore I'd spend my life with! `
`And I was forced to break up with him! `
`You think you understand how I felt when I was forced to be wed in your mother's place... `
`and was held by a man I had barely even talked to?!?!" `
`"I wanted to kill her!! `
`But Nee-san just went and died on her own! `
`That's why I'll kill you!! `
`Otherwise, my thorn-filled life will never eeeeeeeeeeeeeeend!!" `
`...From Kasumi's eyes, `
`tears of passion dripped down. `
`So pitiable... `
`...This person's tears were so clear and beautiful. `
`But for that very reason, ...she hadn't been able to fully withstand her sad pain, `
`and had been given no choice but to listen to the black witch's temptation... `
`".........So sad. `
`...In that case, I'll at least release you...your soul...for all eternity, and free you from the bonds of resentment. `
`......That might be the only bit of charity I can give right now." `
`"Diiiiiiiiiiiee, Ushiromiya Angeeeeeeeeeee!!!" `
`"Goodbye, Aunt Kasumi. `
`......Take a long rest in a quiet world." `
`I no longer feel anger or hatred for you. `
`I just want `
`to let your soul rest in peace. `
`Kasumi's handgun spat fire. `
`Slowly, that bullet continued through a world frozen to the utmost limit, ...aiming for {f:5:Ange}'s forehead. `
`"Mammon." `
`"...Y-Yeah!! `
`Mammon of Greed, right here...!!" `
`"Thanks." `
`"......Huh?" `
`"Because I met you and Sakutarou, I was able to understand everything." `
`‘...Ange...’ `
`"Look away, Sakutarou. `
`......Mammon, `
`release that woman. `
`And protect the honor of Mariage Sorcière...!!" `
`"Y......Yes!! `
`...Prepare yourself, Sumadera Kasumi!!" `
`Even though the world was frozen, the Stake of Greed flashed like lightning... `
`...and had already gotten behind Kasumi... `
`"If there's any virtue in you, we'll meet again on the mountain of Purgatory!! `
`......Diiiiiiiieee!!!" `
`The upper half of Sumadera Kasumi's head was smashed. `
`...Her cage of flesh was shattered, `
`...and she was finally released... `
`"......Next is you. `
`......The black witch. `
`...By now, I think even the fact that you look like Aunt Eva is inexcusable to her." `
`"Heh, ...heheheheheh. `
`...If my form still looks like Ushiromiya Eva, `
`that means you still haven't been able to forgive "me" inside yourself." `
`"I understand, Ange. `
`......Even you want to be released from your thorn-filled life more than anything." `
`"............" `
`"In that case, ...I thought of something interesting. `
`I'll show you magic as well. `
`......I won't be the one to kill you." `
`With the worst of smiles on her face, `
`the black witch changed her form into something like a black mist, `
`...or else a vast swarm of black flying insects, which began to swirl around me. `
`Then, that black mist began to gather bit by bit, ...shaping itself into the form of a human. `
`".........What's this supposed to be...?" `
`Hehheheheheh! `
`You've got at least a vague idea, don't you?! `
`It's the woman you hated and despised the most! `
`The woman who hated and despised you the most...! `
`When the black mist cleared, `
`......over there was... `
`Aunt Eva's form, `
`...as she had been during her life. `
`...Her hands...were holding a gun. `
`"......Aunt Eva... `
`died." `
`"*giggle* Long time no see, Angeeee. `
`...I've come back from hell to kill youu! `
`*cackle*cackle*!!" `
`Aunt Eva glared at me with a mad laugh. `
`"But...I'm not that surprised. `
`Aunt Eva was that kind of person." `
`"I imagine my funeral came as quite a relief to you, right? `
`I feel the same, since I'll never have to see your face again...! `
`But I had just one regret." `
`"And this is it!!" `
`"......Killing me? `
`......Was that your last request?" `
`How pitiful. `
`...Even after death, `
`...my aunt wasn't released from her pain... `
`"The black witch's power is itself the source of my magic. `
`Anger and hatred taught me how to work hard and persist. `
`Completely different from this magic to escape reality that you speak of!" `
`"...The magic you speak of is nothing more than stress reduction through outbursts of anger. `
`...Our magic is different. `
`It can remake the entire world. `
`......It's in a totally different class than your wicked magic." `
`"*giggle*!! `
`In that case, let's settle which is the victor right now, black or white...!! `
`You see my black magic miracle, reviving even after death and pointing a gun at you like this. `
`How exactly do you intend to stop that with a miracle of white magic?" `
`"I've surrounded you with the magic-resisting toxin. `
`You can't call the Seven Sisters anymore. `
`That miracle just now won't occur again...!!" `
`"......Having it occur despite all that is why it's called magic. `
`...Okay. `
`Mammon, lend me your power." `
`...But Mammon didn't respond. `
`She didn't appear. `
`Certainly, as she'd said, `
`the magic-resisting toxin had burned everything up like a wasteland parched by a blazing sun... `
`......This...might be a little tough. `
`"It's useless to call out. `
`Never again! `
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory will never answer!" `
`"And... `
`being able to call them even so is what makes it magic, right?" `
`"......... `
`...How pitiful. `
`So long, Ange. `
`The few days we spent together were fun in their own way. `
`This is goodbye. `
`...Aren't you glad...that the end of the line for you turned out to be this place?" `
`"Yeah, seriously. `
`How thoughtful of you." `
`"Thanks. `
`Then this is farewell." `
`The barrel of the gun rose slowly, `
`...so that you could see all the way down it. `
`Then, `
`......the trigger was slowly...... `
`At that moment, `
`...the gun exploded. `
`...It wasn't that it fired. `
`...It burst. `
`......You're...kidding me... `
`...In shock, inside a frozen space, `
`...Eva looked at the ruptured gun. `
`When time melted, the fragments would probably smash into her face all at once... `
`"...Mammon of Greed, `
`right here." `
`"............You're...kidding me..." `
`Behind Eva's back, Mammon stood. `
`......She had already penetrated the target I had given her. `
`...Which was...the gun. `
`"Is this...enough magic for you, `
`......Aunt Eva?" `
`"......A‐ `
`Angeee......" `
`Then, time melted. `
`The fragments of the burst gun and exploding gunpowder burned her face. `
`Letting out a shrill scream, she covered her face and rolled around... `
`...It was pitiful. `
`"...Your luck was bad. `
`...This is game over, `
`Aunt Eva." `
`I signaled to Mammon. `
`...So that Eva would be freed quickly from the pain of her burnt face as she writhed around. `
`"......Thank you, Mammon. `
`...This time, I want to apologize again, and from the bottom of my heart, for calling all of you powerless on that day in the classroom. `
`You were excellent furniture for protecting witches." `
`"......I'm the one that's grateful. `
`...I feel truly honored at being able to meet a good witch...a good master in the end, and at being able to fulfill my duty as furniture...!" `
`Mammon had understood. `
`This would be the final job I'd give her. `
`Mammon quietly walked up to me. `
`Then, she looked down at Eva. `
`"...Aunt Eva, `
`thanks for sticking with me for so long. `
`This is farewell. `
`<Have a nice dream>. `
`<See you in hell>." `
`"<Cool>." `
`Then, ...the light sound of her forehead being bored into rang out. `
`...The battle of gunpowder smoke and fury...of white and black magic...ended. `
`I get the feeling it was a long......truly a long journey. `
`And the world slowly... `
`sank into darkness...... `
`The stars that should've been sparkling......lay not in the sky, but were scattered beneath me. `
`...When I realized that the pearl and ruby made a red and white stream, `
`I noticed that it was a vast nighttime scene spread out below... `
`I was in the sky of that nighttime scene, neither standing nor flying, `
`...but simply floating. `
`...From nowhere in particular, I could hear a *clap*clap*clap*, `
`a truly dull applause. `
`I know. `
`...It's the one who ordered me to go on a journey, `
`{f:5:Bernkastel}. `
`"......Congratulations, `
`Endless Witch, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}. `
`At the end of your travels, you understood everything about magic." `
`"...Yes. `
`......I now...understand everything about magic. `
`......I am...a witch. `
`...The last witch who inherited the magical world created by Mariage Sorcière." `
`"......No one besides you...can tear {f:5:Beatrice}'s world to pieces." `
`"Because I know witches, ......I learned how to resist them." `
`"............" `
`"...Magic is made of love and sadness and anger. `
`...No matter how cruel a witch {f:5:Beatrice} might have been, `
`the source of her magic is exactly the same." `
`"......And that's why I wish I could leave that world of hers alone. `
`...After all, in her eyes at least, that world is complete." `
`"......But then you'd have to give up on your family." `
`"............ `
`...That's right. `
`So, I don't like doing it, but I have to fight. `
`......The very reason I left on this journey to become a witch... `
`...was so I could bet on the faint chance that I'd be able to take my family back someday." `
`"Unless you kill {f:5:Beatrice}, only worlds of isolation can exist for you. `
`...As one who has traveled to billions of Fragments, I guarantee it." `
`"......I understand. `
`...I can't afford to have compassion. `
`...I must make my heart a demon... `
`...and tear her heart to pieces." `
`"...It's good that you're steady in that resolve. `
`I was worried that, as another witch like her, you might grow attached and lose your will to continue." `
`It felt a bit hollow hearing that from a person whose face was almost always expressionless. `
`{f:5:Bernkastel}. `
`...The mysterious witch who invited me on this journey. `
`............ `
`"At times, I've suspected that you might've lied to me." `
`".........Why?" `
`"...I am the Ange of 1998, so even if I save my family, they will only be saved for the Ange of 1986. `
`...They won't be saved for me. `
`So I've sometimes felt like I was being deceived." `
`"......... `
`...That is correct. `
`I deceived you." `
`"...But now I'm grateful. `
`......After all, `
`in the end, you did teach me how to get my family back." `
`"......I didn't teach you anything. `
`...If you know something, it's because you've reached that mental state by yourself, as a witch. `
`That mental state is different from my own. `
`......I personally cannot understand it, but if that's the truth, then congratulations." `
`"I'm not a player in this game, but a piece. `
`You said that to me, right?" `
`"......Yes, I said it." `
`"Now, I fully understand that role. `
`......A piece doesn't need emotions. `
`It just has to give its all for victory's sake." `
`"......Yes. `
`That is correct. `
`A game requires that you each make the best possible moves, right? `
`If your moves get distorted by hesitation and confusion, your opponent will be confused as well." `
`......Sorry, {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`But...don't hate me. `
`..."Ushiromiya Ange" still needs her family. `
`So, I have the right to fight you, ...so that I can take them back. `
`And, you have the responsibility to be challenged by me to a fight. `
`......So...don't hate me. `
`In exchange... `
`If you do win in this game, `
`I'll give you my blessing as well. `
`Come on, let's go. `
`......As the piece I am, it's finally time for my true turn. `
`Sorry, {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`{e:120:I won't hand Onii‐chan over to you...!!!} `
