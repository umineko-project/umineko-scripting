`I had planned on taking a nap, ...but the boat really was shaking bad. `
`I gave up on sleeping and went up onto the deck. `
`There, I was welcomed by the shining sun and a strong sea breeze... `
`Amakusa had been doing some stretches on the deck. `
`...He must have a lot of time on his hands too. `
`After all, it'll be several more hours before we reach Niijima. `
`It would only have taken a couple dozen minutes by airplane, but there was the chance that the Niijima airport was under the Sumadera family's web. `
`The harbor would probably be the same. `
`For that reason, I had obtained a boat that would let me land while avoiding the harbor, no questions asked. `
`I'd bumped into a cheery boat captain, `
`treated him generously, and he had decided to help me out, amused... `
`"Still gonna be a while?" `
`"I just asked the captain, and it sounds like it'll take a full two hours more. `
`Well, beggars can't be choosers." `
`"......The weather sure is nice. `
`Feels like I'll burn." `
`"Going to read on the deck? `
`You'll damage your book." `
`Amakusa apparently thought this because I was clutching Maria onee-chan's diary under my arm. `
`I'd been reading it half asleep, which was why I'd come back up still clutching it. `
`"How's it going? `
`Think you'll be able to find the truth of Rokkenjima from Maria-san's diary?" `
`"......Who knows. `
`No matter how much I investigate what happened on that island, it won't make for anything more than a theory. `
`There's no truth written in the message bottle or Onee-chan's diary, just a fairy tale with a witch walking around. `
`...I'm stuck." `
`"Looks like you've got nothing to look forward to except questioning those involved on Niijima." `
`"I imagine the Witch Hunters have showered them with questions over and over, so I'm pretty sure I won't find any new facts." `
`"Hehhaha...! `
`So even though your hopes are that low, you're willing to spend a half-day trip on a boat to go to Niijima anyway! Talk about fickle." `
`"......It's like a journey of self-satisfaction, so that I can say "I investigated". `
`I'm not so naive as to seriously think that the truth of 12 years ago will be revealed." `
`"And when you're done with your self-satisfaction trip, what'll you do next?" `
`"Who knows. `
`I haven't thought about it. `
`......I'll go to Niijima, ask some people who were involved. `
`...Then, after going to Rokkenjima in the end and leaving some flowers, my journey will be over." `
`......Several days have already passed since this journey began. `
`After being told by {f:5:Bernkastel} on the roof of that building to search for the truth of 12 years ago, `
`I'd left on a journey like trying to grasp a cloud. `
`At the time, I felt as though I'd experienced something mystical...and had the feeling that I might be able to grasp some kind of miracle at the end of this journey. `
`...But after several days passed, my excitement died down. `
`On that day, when I stood on the roof of that skyscraper, my heart was completely cornered and dead. `
`...So I'd wanted from the bottom of my heart to be released from the cage of my body and rise into the sky... `
`and had crossed the fence in order to die. `
`Maybe experiencing the desire to die and actually stepping forwards, throwing my body down... `
`caused some kind of mystical experience inside my head, making me think I had received a message from a witch. `
`......The excitement from my jump lessened over time, and the more I came back to my senses, the more this journey lost its meaning. `
`But I didn't even consider suspending this journey just because of that. `
`If I stop this journey, it'll mean acknowledging that the message from that witch was an illusion. `
`And I felt as though that meant throwing away the promise the witch made... `
`and any chance that someone from my family might come back. `
`So, because it was hard to believe that those events were an illusion, I've continued on my journey. `
`I don't seriously believe that this journey will change anything. `
`...It's even up to me when to end this journey. `
`It's up to me to choose where the final destination is. `
`In the end, this journey is only for my self-satisfaction... `
`"......Self-satisfaction, huh? `
`It sounds bad when you say it, but I think that's actually what life is all about." `
`"...Oh? `
`If that's the answer you've reached after hovering over the line between life and death in the mercenary business, that's probably pretty deep." `
`"Don't take it so lightly. `
`What I'm trying to say...is that the only one who can acknowledge you in this world is you yourself." `
`Amakusa continued stretching as he spoke. `
`In an irritatingly fresh way. `
`Hearing it told to me as though from a teacher made me instinctively want to resist, but what he was saying was extremely sensible. `
`"......... `
`...That may be true. `
`People work hard when they want to be acknowledged by someone. `
`...In most cases, that someone is their parents. `
`Children learn how to work hard because they want to be praised by their parents. `
`......Although that's why I never learned." `
`"Sorry, that's not how I meant it. `
`...What I'm trying to say is that there's nothing wrong with self-satisfaction. `
`No matter who praises you, it's meaningless unless you can accept it. `
`...Turning it around, even if no one praises you, that doesn't matter as long as you can accept it." `
`"......Self-satisfaction tends to contradict a desire to improve oneself, so we're usually taught that it's bad. `
`Somehow, your argument seems like a pretty fresh take on it, Amakusa." `
`"The anguish of the human world comes when you want someone to acknowledge you, but you don't know what it is you should be striving for. `
`I had a time like that too. `
`I wanted to be acknowledged by someone, but I didn't know what I wanted them to acknowledge about me. `
`And since I didn't know what to strive for or how far I should go to be acknowledged, `
`I did a lot of crazy things." `
`"And the answer you reached...was self-satisfaction?" `
`"It sounds bad, but that's how it is. `
`Rich is the one who is content with what they are, they say." `
`"......If I'm satisfied with my life, it doesn't matter what other people say. `
`It's the same for your life, and for this journey. `
`No one has any right to criticize you other than you yourself, Ange-san." `
`"You're the only one who determines the meaning and results of your journey. `
`If it's been a meaningful journey for you, then that's more than enough." `
`"......... `
`......I always did take you for a flippant ladies man, but you really do say weird things every once in a while. `
`I'll bet you think saying stuff like that will make you popular." `
`"Of course not, of course not. `
`That's not how I meant it at all. `
`......Looks like you want to be alone. `
`I'll head over to see the boat captain. `
`Please, take it easy." `
`Amakusa apparently decided I was in a bad mood. `
`...Although I didn't feel that way myself. `
`Or, he might have finished a set of stretches and wanted to cool off in the shade. `
`The sea winds were strong, but not enough to cool the rays of the sun. `
`Amakusa disappeared. `
`Only I remained. `
`"......Self-satisfaction is life itself, huh?" `
`"That's just boring. `
`Life is nothing without greed." `
`I noticed that Mammon had suddenly appeared, her abundant hair fluttering over by the prow of the ship. `
`"It's true that a life of greed would be fun. `
`But unlike you, Humans have a limited life-span. `
`If greed is eternal, that means a person will have desires even in the last moment before they die. `
`Having desires means there's something that you want. `
`Something you don't have, some way you aren't complete." `
`"...I'm sure it's tough to die when you can't think of your life as being a full one. `
`So I'm sure self-satisfaction is necessary." `
`"......I see. `
`Because of the existence of a life span, you have to compromise like that? `
`All of my masters had very long life spans, so I've never thought of it." `
`"I wonder if Humans live for the purpose of becoming satisfied. `
`...If so, it's probably easiest to live without desires. `
`...I see, so that's why greed is one of the seven deadly sins." `
`"*giggle* `
`Your praise honors me." `
`Apparently that counted as a compliment in Mammon's eyes. `
`She turned and gave a graceful bow. `
`"Ange-sama, `
`do Humans live so that they can find satisfaction at the moment of their deaths?" `
`"...Wouldn't it be pretty tough if you felt you were lacking something when you died?" `
`"If so, then Humans live only so that they can meet a satisfying death. `
`They live so that they can have a better death. `
`They live so that they can die." `
`......This kid's saying something pretty incredible. `
`...I see, as I'd expect from a demon stake. `
`However, it might be the truth. `
`Humans suffer because they aren't satisfied...and live only to find satisfaction. `
`In other words, that might be the same as a desire to die satisfied. `
`"I can't counter that. `
`...People live in order to be satisfied. `
`And they hope to die that way. `
`So, it's really painful when you don't know how to find that satisfaction." `
`"Just how can you find something like that? `
`In a Human's life." `
`"......By being acknowledged. `
`By hearing someone say "You are happy"." `
`"If it doesn't matter who acknowledges them, then I'll do it." `
`"Yeah, that's the problem. `
`......People don't know who needs to acknowledge them." `
`"So, searching for this person who can acknowledge them is the journey of their life? `
`Hmmmm." `
`"It sounds strange. `
`Whether you're acknowledged or not, it supposedly doesn't change your circumstances. `
`...And yet, if you are acknowledged, you will be satisfied, while if you aren't, then you won't. `
`...It's almost like the blue bird. `
`...Because you can't notice the blue bird even though it's already in the cage, you have to go out on a journey searching everywhere." `
`"What the heck. `
`Kyahhahaha. `
`Human lives sure are stupid." `
`"That's right. `
`Amakusa said something really good. `
`...Rich is the one who is content with what they are, ...was it? `
`I don't know where that proverb came from, but it's deep. `
`...Basically, if you can't find enough satisfaction unless someone else acknowledges you, that's the same as not acknowledging yourself. `
`...The ultimate in self-fulfillment is acknowledging yourself." `
`"That's right. `
`Because, if you can "know" that you're fully satisfied, there's no need to be acknowledged by anyone. `
`Just by taking notice of the small things, the Humans' foolish journey of life can be ended easily. `
`You can spend the rest of your life playing and having a good time. `
`A Human's life is so ridiculous, kyahhahahaha!" `
`Mammon's choice of words was bad, but it was surely the truth. `
`If most of a Human's life is a journey with the hopes that someone will acknowledge them, `
`so that they can achieve a satisfied death... `
`......Then when they realize that the person doing the acknowledging isn't someone else, but they themselves, that pointless journey can end. `
`Humans who have ended that journey can probably spend the rest of their lives as they wish, with their heads held high. `
`How noble, how praiseworthy would that be... `
`"You know, `
`it seems Amakusa's on pretty bad terms with his parents. `
`...That makes sense. `
`Any decent parents would want him to get the hell out of the trade he's in." `
`"Does that really matter though? `
`As long as it's fun for the person in question." `
`"......Exactly. `
`That's what it comes down to in the end. `
`Criticism formed by the observations of other people doesn't matter. `
`If your existence is firmly acknowledged by you yourself, that's enough. `
`...If you can live with confidence in yourself, you'll surely be able to accept and be satisfied with any kind of lifestyle." `
`"I'm sure Amakusa will eventually eat a stray bullet on the battlefield and get seriously injured. `
`...He might even die. `
`But I don't think he'd view that as something unfair. `
`I'm sure he'd cackle about how that's also part of life." `
`"What a great way to live. `
`I could fall for the guy." `
`"...Pitiful Humans who can't acknowledge themselves... `
`wander about searching for that their whole lives, and without anything being accepted, they do nothing but grumble and die while still unsatisfied. `
`...How pitiful. `
`Compared to people whose lives drag on without any purpose, `
`Amakusa is more likely to eventually die by the roadside, but I think he's much more noble for living his life with his head held high." `
`"Aren't the winners in life those who achieve enlightenment? `
`If they can do that even a little sooner, they'll be able to live that much more of their life effectively." `
`......With Mammon's words, `
`...I finally accepted a certain fact. `
`In the past, ...I've called that girl unusual, a little strange. `
`However, `
`...that wasn't true. `
`All she did was keep her head held high... `
`...and finish that journey faster than anyone else. `
`".........Maybe that's what made Maria onee-chan...so amazing. `
`When she was at the age where she might or might not enter the first year of elementary school, she had already reached that point." `
`For people like us, looking at her life from the outside, it wasn't something we'd call blessed. `
`But even though days like that were engraved in her diary, `
`...they always finished up by saying that it was a happy day. `
`Even though the part of her mother that didn't love her daughter came and went, `
`she believed that her mother loved her. `
`The mother's love that didn't exist, she created herself, filling her world with love. `
`Others might observe her as an unsatisfied, pitiful girl, `
`...but she herself acknowledged that she was satisfied. `
`And so, she was happy that way. `
`It's easy to observe that as something pitiable and sad. `
`But to her, that was an outsider's opinion, so it didn't matter. `
`"Whether or not it was happy for her"...was the only important thing. `
`It's just like how, when people who live in the city point to the lifestyles of those in rural areas, `
`and mourn their inconvenience and feel sympathy for them, it's really none of their business. `
`If those who live there are satisfied with what they have, that's more than enough. `
`"......I've finally noticed something. `
`I noticed it just now. `
`...I did something horrible to Maria onee-chan. `
`......And to you all and Sakutarou as well, on that day." `
`"............" `
`"Whether magic exists...or not. `
`...That's not up to other people to decide. `
`It's up to you yourself. `
`Whether magic exists to Maria onee-chan is a problem for Maria onee-chan to decide, not me." `
`"...And yet, when I was young, on that day, I said it. `
`By saying there was no way magic exists, ...I hurt her." `
`The fact that magic doesn't exist in my eyes...matters in my world. `
`But denying it even in Onee-chan's world for that reason was totally misguided. `
`"Mariage Sorcière is the Witches' Alliance Maria onee-chan created. `
`I was invited into it...and told to become a witch with them." `
`"Thinking it a new, interesting game, I went along with that for a while. `
`...But, because of the cruelty of youth, `
`I got tired of it half-way through. `
`And, ...I tore her pure heart apart with sharp words." `
`"...At that time, we must've gotten into a huge fight. `
`I forgot about it right away, but she couldn't forget about it. `
`...After all, to her, magic was a natural power that really existed, `
`and she believed that she'd be able to share it with me." `
`"...To Maria onee-chan, `
`magic is a power that can interpret the world as blessed...no, which can truly make everything blessed. `
`She just wanted to share that with me too. `
`The young me tore that feeling apart. `
`...So, she closed herself up in a shell, assuming that she wouldn't be able to share her magic with anyone." `
`"......If that's true, then Lady {f:5:Maria}'s journey through life wasn't over after all. `
`If she'd been able to accept herself, then there'd be no need to collapse just because you denied her, Ange-sama." `
`"Onee-chan was young. `
`She still hadn't reached a philosophical viewpoint like Amakusa. `
`...Yeah, now I understand... `
`That's why the witches' alliance called Mariage Sorcière was necessary." `
`——An alliance where each acknowledges that the other is a witch. `
`"...That's right, I'm pretty sure that was the first article in the agreement of Mariage Sorcière. `
`...Witches of the alliance would acknowledge each other and respect each other. `
`That's the deepest and only meaning of the witches' alliance..." `
`Maria onee-chan wanted to share with me the secret laws to make the world happy, called magic. `
`But I was young. `
`And she was too. `
`...I hurt her with innocent cruelty. `
`"......On that day, I said...cruel things. `
`To you all and Sakutarou. `
`I said there was no way you exist." `
`"How rude. `
`We acknowledge that we exist ourselves. `
`We're not like Humans, with their souls half-asleep. `
`..."I think, therefore I am". `
`Whether you acknowledge or deny magic, the existence of the magic called the Seven Stakes of Purgatory...is a fact. `
`...As long as we acknowledge it ourselves, to borrow your words." `
`"It truly would be violence for another person like me to deny it. `
`......I'm sure that'd be like having your true mother yell "I wish you had never been born"... `
`no, "Disappear"." `
`...Even after being slammed by all those words, `
`...Maria onee-chan's magic... `
`...made her believe in her mother's love. `
`Sakutarou, her magic friend, always encouraged her. `
`...He kept saying that her mother loved her, that she was coming home late because of her work, `
`and that she would definitely bring back a present... `
`Even after Maria learned that her mother's work wasn't really the cause, magic allowed her to continue believing. `
`And by believing that her mother loved her, by acknowledging herself, `
`she filled her world with love and peace and serenity, ...establishing it completely. `
`"What happened 12 years ago, ...what happened to my family... `
`...This was never...a journey to search for that." `
`"......Then what kind of journey is this?" `
`"It was a journey...to apologize to Maria onee-chan for what happened that day." `
`"............" `
`"I don't know why, but that's what I think. `
`...If I hadn't hurt her, `
`......the incident 12 years ago might not have occurred. `
`...That's what I think." `
`I have no basis for it. `
`I don't have a clue how hurting Onee-chan could be connected with that mysterious incident several years later. `
`But, for some reason, I can't imagine that there's no connection. `
`A witch caused that incident. `
`And the culprit is the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`And {f:5:Beatrice} was part of the Mariage Sorcière Alliance of Witches. `
`I horribly hurt the other witch of that alliance. `
`I hurt her with the thought that magic doesn't exist. `
`......So, several years later, a crime caused by a witch occurred, `
`and a two-day period that couldn't be explained with anything but magic was thrust in my face, thanks to the message bottle. `
`"...There's no way I wasn't involved somehow. `
`......I don't get it. `
`It could be coincidence, or it could be fate. `
`......For some reason, I've starting thinking like that on this journey." `
`"And what's your basis for it?" `
`"I have none. `
`I just think it's true." `
`"Hmmmm... `
`The Japanese sure are interesting. `
`Even when they're the victim, they feel as though they did something wrong and apologize for no reason. `
`...I could understand if you said "I hate {f:5:Beatrice} for stealing my family!" or something, `
`but you really are weird, feeling guilty for no reason and apologizing." `
`"Of course I hate {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`I couldn't continue this journey without that feeling. `
`But it's okay to choose yet another purpose for this journey. `
`There's nothing wrong with adding on a goal of apologizing for past sins, in addition to getting revenge on a witch for what happened 12 years ago. `
`I can at least go to Rokkenjima, apologize for my reckless remarks, and offer flowers." `
`"...No, ......there's something better than flowers. `
`And I think that would be more fitting for Onee-chan." `
`I stood up, not minding that the sea breeze scattered my hair, and concentrated my mind... `
`I lifted my palm up to the height of my head...and imagined a vast space... `
`"......Ange-sama, ........." `
`"...Be quiet. `
`......... `
`...Come, arise. `
`...I am the witch apprentice, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}. `
`...I was excommunicated, but I was once a member of the same alliance, and you are the dearly-missed furniture who played with me. `
`Answer to my call......" `
`It was hard to tell in the middle of the day, but a faint blue light gathered around the palm of my hand. `
`......Then, `
`......Sakutarou's form was revived. `
`It truly did bring back memories, that figure. `
`His cute ears, his bright-red muffler. `
`...It came off easily, so Onee-chan faithfully re-wrapped it all the time, didn't she...? `
`"...Sakutaro, `
`...do you recognize us? `
`Do you know who we are...?" `
`‘...Uryu...? `
`Uryu...? `
`Mammon...? `
`Ange......?’ `
`With a sleepy face, as though waking up from a long slumber, Sakutarou looked all around him as he spoke. `
`"It's been a long time, ...Sakutarou. `
`I'm pretty sure this is the first time I've summoned you with my own power. `
`...And now, I'm the only one who can summon you." `
`‘.........Uryu...’ `
`Those words might have been a bit cruel. `
`Sakutarou's face clouded over... `
`"In the past, I denied you. `
`......Now that I've summoned you, `
`...it means I've accepted your existence." `
`‘......Are you sure...? `
`Is it really all right...for me to be summoned into Ange's world...?’ `
`His eyes were a bit frightened. `
`...It was only natural. `
`I, who had played with him like a friend before, `
`had suddenly denied him and tried to burn him with the magic-resisting toxin. `
`It was only natural that he was scared... `
`"I apologize... `
`for that day. `
`......To you too, Mammon. `
`And to the rest of you." `
`At some point, ...the rest of the Seven Sisters had gathered on the deck. `
`No, they're always there. `
`Always by my side. `
`As long as I acknowledge that it's okay for them to be there, they'll always appear. `
`"You certainly do exist. `
`Lucifer. `
`And Leviathan. `
`And Satan. `
`And Belphegor. `
`And Mammon. `
`And Beelzebub. `
`And Asmodeus. `
`...And Sakutarou too." `
`"...Are you sure? `
`You're one challenging {f:5:Beatrice}-sama, Ange-sama. `
`...Is it okay for one in a position of denying witches to acknowledge us?" `
`"As to whether magic exists or not in my world, sorry, but let me put that on hold. `
`It's not like I myself acknowledged the existence of magic." `
`"...But then, doesn't that contradict the fact...that you're acknowledging us?" `
`"It's because magic exists for people who believe. `
`Even if I don't. `
`If someone believes, then magic will exist in the human world." `
`"That fact won't change in the slightest whether I believe in magic or not. `
`No, it mustn't change. `
`That person just had to hold their head up high and believe in their own magic. `
`I acknowledge that. `
`So, it wouldn't be strange at all for all of you to exist." `
`"......Quite a play on words, ...but it's an interesting interpretation." `
`"What you're saying, Ange-sama, is probably a Devil's Proof." `
`"A Devil's Proof...?" `
`"Right?! `
`To prove the existence of demons, you just need to find one." `
`"But it's impossible to deny the existence of demons." `
`"Kyahha! `
`And we're here. `
`That means that whether Ange-sama believes in magic or not, our existence is unshakable." `
`‘...Uryu? `
`The magic-resisting toxin... `
`...is disappearing... `
`...from Ange...’ `
`"Y-You're right... `
`...Even though you're in a position of denying magic, ...why...?" `
`"That's probably... `
`...because I learned what it means to respect and acknowledge. `
`Right now, ...I might be able... `
`to understand the depths of Maria onee-chan's...and {f:5:Beatrice}'s magic." `
`In the past, I didn't believe in things like magic. `
`Thinking something like that couldn't exist, I acted like I was closing my eyes tightly and couldn't see anything. `
`But now, I'm different. `
`I get the feeling I can look right at the thing called magic...and close in on its true nature... `
`"...How frustrating. `
`It's truly rare to find a Human so free of the magic-resisting toxin in this day and age. `
`And she has such an uncommon genius for being a witch..." `
`"That's right. `
`...If Ange-sama tried to become a witch right now, `
`...she could grow to be a Great Witch, maybe even at {f:5:Beatrice}-sama's level." `
`"Even so, she has acknowledged our existence and is our master. `
`...Most likely, Ange-sama will be our final master. `
`Let us think of this as our final service, and apply ourselves to the fullest." `
`"...Ble-ah. `
`But I just can't staaand that Ange-sama still doesn't believe in magic herself." `
`"...Ange-sama, please believe in magic toooo. `
`It feels like a waste to finally have a master and have it not be a wiiitch." `
`"Even though you have outstanding talent that could make you one of the greatest of witches, your goal is to attack witches. `
`It's so frustrating. `
`...Well, even so, that's your life, the way you live, `
`and in the world where you've decided that, there's nothing we can do to complain." `
`"Thanks for understanding me. `
`Yeah, whether magic exists {i:to me} or not, `
`that's up to me to decide. `
`Regardless of whether magic actually does exist somewhere in the world or not." `
`When I think about it, this world is so vast...and yet so small. `
`Billions of people live on the earth. `
`But I probably won't meet even 1% of those people. `
`Even so, I will speak of a world. `
`"My world", which doesn't know even 1% of the world. `
`"I'm not qualified to deny the laws of a world I don't know. `
`...So just because magic doesn't exist in my world, I can't deny that magic exists in a world I don't know. `
`That makes it a true Devil's Proof. `
`No, maybe it's more like "When in Rome, do as the Romans do"." `
`I can be confident in the world I know. `
`So even if that's denied by a complete stranger who doesn't know a thing about my world, that's nothing to worry about. `
`And in the same way, I've got no right to deny a world I don't know... `
`just because I don't know about it. `
`"Therefore, `
`regardless of whether there's magic in my world or not, `
`...I can't deny the magic Maria onee-chan taught me." `
`‘Uryu! `
`After all, even if you've never seen it, `
`...magic exists!’ `
`"Yes. `
`That's why, as I've already said, `
`...you friends of the witches' alliance, Mariage Sorcière, `
`can't be denied by me or anyone else." `
`I proclaimed that most important part again. `
`......Even though the sea breeze and the crashing of the waves were noisy, it was a time of silence. `
`Both Sakutarou and the Seven Sisters of Purgatory...reflected upon my words. `
`And, probably, I did too. `
`Does magic exist? `
`Do witches exist? `
`While ignoring what the answer would be for my own world, ...I acknowledged their existence. That contradiction was what I'd proclaimed so boldly. `
`‘Thank you, ...Ange.’ `
`"If you'll acknowledge that much, can't you acknowledge witches too...? `
`...No, that was a foolish question. `
`You already have a clear answer to it." `
`"Sorry. `
`Though, I do acknowledge that witches might exist somewhere in this world. `
`But that doesn't shake my world." `
`"...You won't acknowledge witches or magic. `
`You'll definitely expose the truth of Rokkenjima. `
`...Right?" `
`"Yes. `
`That's my world. `
`Even if a real witch exists, I won't acknowledge it in my world. `
`No matter how much that witch tries to convince me." `
`"Your position is to attack witches, Ange-sama. `
`...And I understand well that you haven't the slightest wavering in that feeling. `
`We are your furniture, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory...! `
`We will always be by your side. `
`We'll always be waiting for the day that we can be useful...!" `
`"Although, since you don't believe in magic, we can never be anything more than people to talk to." `
`"That's enough for now. `
`We've been left room to exist. `
`For that alone, we should thank and acknowledge Ange-sama." `
`"In short! `
`All of us!" `
`‘Are all together again... `
`Uryu-!!’ `
`"Kya-h!! `
`Sakutaro-! `
`Let me squeeze youuuuuuuuu-!!" `
`When Sakutarou was overcome with emotion and tears came to his eyes, the Seven Sisters closed in and mobbed him. `
`...They were also celebrating a long-missed reunion. `
`If their existence is permitted, they're definitely capable of existing here. `
`No, even if I don't permit it, they can exist. `
`Because I acknowledged them, they {i:showed their reuinon's joy} to me as well. `
`As I watched over that scene, ......I reflected over what this journey of mine meant. `
`"......I wonder if everyone will forgive me this way." `
`"You've done enough. `
`We are furniture. `
`Just being summoned, `
`just being allowed to be by your side makes us happy." `
`‘Uryu...! `
`Ange, thank you very much...!’ `
`"...Come to think of it, why was I able to summon Sakutarou? `
`...No, it's the other way around. `
`Why wasn't Onee-chan able to summon Sakutarou?" `
`Maria onee-chan had despaired, thinking that Sakutarou had died. `
`Which meant she hadn't been able to summon him like this anymore. `
`In the past, Onee-chan said it was more advantageous in a summoning to have a vessel. `
`However, a vessel is like training wheels, and it shouldn't be absolutely necessary. `
`...In other words, even if the stuffed animal lion that was Sakutarou's vessel didn't exist, it should've be possible to summon him. `
`...No, when you put it like that, `
`it's even a little doubtful whether summoned things can be limited by life and death. `
`Moreover, Sakutarou should have been an especially important friend to Maria onee-chan. `
`She should've been able to strive hard to summon him one more time. `
`It certainly was sad that the original stuffed animal vessel had been torn apart, `
`but why did he "die" and become impossible to summon again...? `
`‘...That's because... `
`...at that time, Maria saw my stuffed animal torn... `
`and {i:decided} `
`that I'd died.’ `
`"It's the same as the existence of magic. `
`...If Sakutarou has died in Lady {f:5:Maria}'s world, `
`then he can't exist in her world." `
`‘......Uryu...’ `
`The shock of having her beloved stuffed animal torn apart... `
`had left a wound in her heart serious enough to prevent her from summoning her irreplaceable close friend. `
`{i:In Maria onee‐chan's eyes}, Sakutarou had died. `
`So even if Sakutarou can exist like this to me, he cannot exist before her. `
`‘I...was always with Maria... `
`...When Maria cried, I was always right beside her, telling her not to cry... `
`...But my form, my voice, ...nothing of me will reach Maria now...’ `
`Sakutarou hung his head, looking sad. `
`"...After that incident, the nature of Mariage Sorcière rapidly began to change. `
`Before then, the alliance was a peaceful thing. `
`But after that incident, it grew full of shadier things, focusing on how to curse people you hate. `
`...Onee-chan's diary began to show a clear change." `
`A diary is a mirror that reflects one's heart as it is. `
`It probably showed the personality called Maria die...... `
`and be reborn as the evil witch personality, {f:5:Maria}. `
`When she buried that diary in hatred and sadness, ...her heart surely wasn't satisfied. `
`Because it wasn't satisfied, she had to bury it with hatred and sadness. `
`And while still unsatisfied, she met with death. `
`...I wonder if her unsatisfied soul has a hole opened in its chest from sadness even now... `
`and continually wanders, dripping tears down and calling Sakutarou's name... `
`............ `
`"......Onee-chan...needs you." `
`‘Uryu......’ `
`"What can I do to revive you in Maria onee-chan's world? `
`If I can learn that method, I'll be able to save Onee-chan. `
`...That's the method of atonement I've been given. `
`What can be done to revive Sakutarou?" `
`‘...To Maria, my vessel had a very important meaning...’ `
`"The vessel. `
`...In other words, if we could revive the lion stuffed animal..." `
`‘But... `
`...Mama Rosa made my stuffed animal herself, so only she could make it...’ `
`Even inside the diary, Maria onee-chan had asked this of {f:5:Beatrice}...and was refused for that reason. `
`The magical significance of a stuffed animal being unique and handmade is very large. `
`Then, if we could make the same thing once more... `
`But Aunt Rosa is already gone from this world. `
`We can't make the same thing again. `
`"...Was there ever another identical stuffed animal made, or anything like that?" `
`"He's a stuffed animal made to be Lady {f:5:Maria}'s birthday present...and is the only one of his kind in the world. `
`...A handmade and unique vessel. `
`That's why it conceals a great magical power. `
`And, ...if lost, it cannot be obtained again. `
`It won't revive..." `
`‘......Uryu......’ `
`...Because she knew that, `
`Maria onee-chan watched that stuffed animal, which was unique in that world, get torn apart, `
`......and despaired. `
`Because it was the only one of its kind in the world, `
`and she couldn't permit a compromise such as buying another one, ...she had despaired from the bottom of her heart... `
`"...But Sakutarou is right here. `
`Even without a vessel, he's here. `
`Because I acknowledge that, he certainly exists in my world. `
`......Even if Maria onee-chan doesn't acknowledge him, that cannot be denied. `
`Right...?" `
`"Logically, that's true, `
`...but I think using the same logic to make Lady {f:5:Maria} accept him could be difficult." `
`‘...Maria, `
`...I'm not dead... `
`I'm right here...... `
`...Uryu...’ `
`"I'm sure that on Rokkenjima, `
`...I'll be able to be reunited with Maria onee-chan. `
`And, ...no matter what, I'll revive the you that's inside Onee-chan...and let you be reunited." `
`‘Can you do it...?’ `
`"It'll probably be hard. `
`...Just like how, after being invited into the witches' alliance, I rejected it without understanding what it meant, `
`she might also reject your existence." `
`"......But, I've got to do it. `
`That's the only way I can atone for my sins." `
`"......Ange-sama..." `
`"What's waiting on Rokkenjima? `
`And what will happen, what will be created? `
`...Or maybe nothing will happen." `
`‘............’ `
`"That island, which was the beginning of everything, is the final destination of this journey. `
`......You all are the furniture of a witch, so as your master, `
`I have to {i:take you home}, to the witch's island, to Rokkenjima." `
`Even though the rays of the sun had been so strong, at some point clouds had started to hang down. `
`The spray that hit my cheek might not all have come from crashing waves. `
`"Ange-san, `
`looks like we're gonna get a bit of a shower. `
`Maybe you'd better go below deck." `
`Amakusa called out to me with an expression that said "Oh, you're still here?" `
`When I looked up, I saw that the island's silhouette had gotten much larger. `
`We might reach land very soon. `
`I remembered that the weather report had mentioned scattered rains. `
`The sky wasn't dark enough for rain clouds. `
`It'll probably be just for a short time. `
`Even though the rain was light enough not to be a pain... `
`...Having rain start to fall as we approached the island felt like some kind of fate. `
`It was raining on October 4, 1986 as well. `
`I'm approaching the Rokkenjima of that day...and not just in distance... `
`I went back down with Amakusa. `
`He was carrying what looked like a really large and heavy golf bag. `
`It was something Amakusa had brought back with him on a day when we'd split up. `
`...I didn't inquire as to its contents, but it was hard to imagine that they were anything peaceful. `
`"......I won't go so far as to ask what's inside, but it looks heavy." `
`"Why are these things so darn heavy all the time? `
`A French instructor taught me something interesting about that once. `
`He said they should always be heavy. `
`......After all, a human life is heavier than the world. `
`So these should be even heavier." `
`"......It'd be nice if you didn't need to use them." `
`"That would be nice." `
`Amakusa set the golf bag-like luggage down beside him. `
`A two-propeller aircraft touched down on the runway. `
`Considering the weather, it couldn't have been a pleasant flight. `
`Everything after this flight had been suspended due to weather. `
`Cutting through the drizzle as she traversed the runway, Sumadera Kasumi entered the lobby with two black-suits as guards. `
`The four black-suits who had been waiting inside the lobby stood up and respectfully lowered their heads in salute. `
`"""Kasumi-sama...!!""" `
`"Propeller planes certainly do shake... `
`I wouldn't want to ride one again." `
`"We have a car prepared! `
`Please, this way." `
`They got into two luxury cars that had been rented... `
`"...Ange should be heading for Rokkenjima. `
`A deserted island... How convenient. `
`......You've arranged for some tools, I take it?" `
`"Yes Ma'am...!" `
`The black-suit in the passenger seat put a heavy bag that had been set by his feet onto his lap, `
`opened the catch with a *click*, and showed Kasumi what was inside. `
`Inside were several silver lumps of carefully wrapped aluminum foil. `
`...He peeled one open to show her. `
`A black, blunt automatic pistol peeked its face out... `
