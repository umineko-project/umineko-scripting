`"......Ah, ......uu......" `
`Silent. `
`Black. `
`Cold. `
`Painful. `
`Rosa regained consciousness bit by bit... `
`And the first thing she thought...was that it would have been better if she hadn't. `
`After all, with her body this cold and hurting, ...the pain grew the more her consciousness returned. `
`It felt like she'd been sleeping on ice-cold marble in the darkness, lying face-down for a long time. `
`...Aaah, this is why I always tell myself. `
`Even if its just for a nap, I've got to at least grab a sofa. `
`I know that, if I naively try to close my eyes for just a second... `
`and end up sleeping on the floor or in the study chair, it'll hurt my body later and make things difficult... `
`Since I slept on such a cold and hard floor, even my bones are ice-cold. `
`Since I slept on such a hard and cold floor, the half of my face pressed down against it hurts a lot. `
`...If I were to look in a mirror right now, I'm sure I'd see an embarrassing mark. `
`I didn't think that just rubbing it would make that mark disappear, `
`but I stroked the hurting side of my face anyway, trying to smooth it over... `
`...I wonder......where this is. `
`I thought it was pitch black, but it looks like it isn't. `
`After all, I can faintly see my own body. `
`...Without a doubt, there was some source of light, `
`but even if I looked up at the ceiling...or else the sky, there was only an expanse of blackness, and I couldn't see a proper light. `
`My body alone was slightly lit, `
`whereas everything else was sunk in darkness... That's what this world was like. `
`It was almost as though Rosa alone had been abandoned in a forgotten world. `
`As her mind grew clearer, `
`she started getting nervous about why she was all alone in a lonely place like this. `
`......When she was about to call out, asking if anyone was there, she heard the `
`...*patter*... `
`*patter*... `
`of footsteps coming towards her. `
`They were light footsteps, so she thought it was probably a kid. `
`She didn't sense anything disturbing, so she wasn't afraid. `
`But they also weren't Maria's footsteps, `
`so, wondering who in the world would be in a darkness like this, she stared in the direction the footsteps were coming from. `
`......As she did, ...a faint, approaching silhouette came into view. `
`It looked...like a child much younger than Maria. `
`...Who is it? `
`I don't know this kid. `
`But, the expression on his face was like a lost child separated from his parents. `
`...As a parent with a daughter herself, Rosa felt as though her chest had been torn apart... `
`‘............Uryu.’ `
`"...Ah! ......" `
`The instant the kid muttered that infantile word, `
`...she felt pain in the half of her face that had started hurting from the cold floor, as though it had been pierced by long, thin, hard needles. `
`Without thinking, she pressed her hand against that side of her face. `
`‘...Are you all right...? `
`Does it still hurt...?’ `
`"...Thanks, I'm fine, little guy. `
`......Where are we...? `
`It's really...cold." `
`‘...Come this way... `
`You mustn't stay here...’ `
`That child took my other hand and pulled with a grim expression on his face. `
`...Rosa didn't have a clue what was going on. `
`However, a single honest expression on a child... `
`can often tell the truth better than a hundred words from an adult. `
`She didn't know the situation, but even so, she dashed along with him, still being pulled... `
`But this was a world where nothing could be seen in the darkness except for their own forms. `
`It didn't even really feel like she was moving forwards. `
`...Even though she was running, she couldn't even feel any wind. `
`It was as though she was still inside a nightmare, ...that kind of unreal sensation... `
`So even though I ran, I couldn't maintain my sense of balance, and my legs got tangled and I fell. `
`...Even in a world that didn't feel real, the pain of smashing my face against the cold, hard floor was reality itself. `
`‘Uryu, ...are you okay...?’ `
`"Ah, ......nn... `
`...I'm sorry, my head hurts." `
`...When the kid said that...infantile word "uryu", pain like being stuck with needles ran though my head again. `
`Even though it had only happened twice, `
`I was somehow able to understand that the child's word was the cause of my pain. `
`...So I said so frankly. `
`"I'm sorry. `
`Could you stop saying "uryu"...?" `
`‘Uryu...’ `
`"Nng, ...wait a second, didn't I tell you to stop...?" `
`‘U, ...au, ...uu-! `
`Sorry...’ `
`I had the feeling that this child's apology caused a sharp pain in my forehead this time. `
`......What is...this child...? `
`I know there's no malice in him, `
`...but when I'm around this child, `
`...my head hurts... `
`‘...Are you okay...? `
`Let's go, quickly... `
`You mustn't stay here...’ `
`"Why shouldn't I be here...? `
`Hey, where is this...? `
`Who are you? `
`Where is your Mama...?" `
`‘......The one who made me... `
`...is you, Mama...’ `
`"...Huh...?" `
`That child stared at me with round eyes. `
`...This kid's Mama......is me...? `
`...Who? `
`Who is...this kid? `
`I don't remember at all. `
`‘Did you...forget about me...? `
`You made me, right...?’ `
`"...Wait a second, stop kidding around. `
`...Maria is my only child. `
`......That's right, where is Maria? `
`Where is she?! `
`Maria...?!" `
`I suddenly grew nervous about Maria not being there. `
`Why am I all alone in a place like this? `
`Where is Maria?! `
`I'm only able to be me because Maria's there for me...! `
`‘...Maria is here, ...but she's not Maria now. `
`It's better if you don't meet with her now. `
`That's better for your sake, and Maria's as well. `
`......For Maria's sake as well, escape.’ `
`"Huh...? `
`What are you saying? `
`Where is Maria? `
`Maria?! `
`Answer me!!" `
`‘Maria's gonna find you...! `
`Come this way, quickly, Mama...!’ `
`That child pulled on my hand again. `
`...He was probably pulling me in the opposite direction from Maria. `
`So I stopped walking. `
`"Let go...! `
`Just who are you...?! `
`What gives you the right to call me Mama...?!" `
`‘...Mama is the one who made me... `
`Did you forget...? `
`For Maria's birthday present, `
`...you made me with your own hands, ...did you forget...?’ `
`".........You...couldn't be... `
`......Maria's...Sakutarou......?!" `
`‘Yes...... `
`The lion stuffed animal Mama made...!’ `
`"Gya—!!" `
`A fierce, sharp pain struck me. `
`It came from the palm he had grasped with his hand. `
`When I knocked his hand away without thinking...and looked at my palm, `
`......a hole the size of a thumb had opened there, and deep-red blood gushed out. `
`...It was a hole so big that I could see through to the other side... `
`‘U-Uryu...! `
`Are you okay?! `
`Are you okay?! `
`What's wrong...?!’ `
`Sakutarou noticed my wound and panicked. `
`...As far as I could tell by looking at him, he couldn't understand why my hand had sustained a serious injury. `
`But in my eyes, it felt like I'd been injured because he'd grabbed my hand. `
`Regardless of whether there was malice in him, `
`...I understood that this child was something that would do harm to me, and he instantly seemed eerie... `
`"Go away...!! `
`You have nothing to do with me...! `
`Sakutarou was just a disgusting, crappy stuffed animal, right...?!! `
`I don't know you, I'm not your Mama...!! `
`Go away...! `
`Disappear!!" `
`‘......U......yu......’ `
`Slowly, ...the base of Sakutarou's neck... `
`was sliced in a horizontal line. `
`It gaped open, and pitch-black insides peeked out. `
`...No blood poured from it. `
`Only an empty blackness peeked out. `
`Then, ......from the insides of the gash, `
`...cotton snow poured out, ...and as bits of cotton scattered, he slumped over. `
`Then, ...all that remained was a crumpled yellow cloth... `
`and bits of cotton that looked like sticky, crushed cotton candy. `
`......A lion...stuffed animal. `
`Without a doubt. `
`These were the remains of the Sakutarou stuffed animal I tore apart on that day, while overcome by my emotions. `
`The instant I realized that, `
`......a long, sharp shriek that could rupture an eardrum tore the world apart... `
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!! `
`Sakutaroooooooo, Sakutaroooooooooo, waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuhhhh!! `
`Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuhhhh!!" `
`Like a flood from a broken dam, or like a broken TV... `
`...Maria cried out in a high-pitched voice. `
`......Her voice, which made the ears throb, brought up two emotions in me... `
`One was regret, "Yeah, I was overcome by my emotions and went overboard". `
`It was a mother's desire to kneel down right away, hold Maria's head, cry with her and apologize. `
`...In actual fact, I did that right away. `
`I held Maria's head and apologized, crying. `
`But Maria didn't stop crying. `
`On the contrary, she rejected me, the one who had torn her closest friend apart, and pushed me away forcefully with both hands. `
`I had been on my knees in an unnatural position, so I fell backwards easily. `
`Maria scraped together the yellow scraps of cloth and cotton bits, ...buried her face in them, and cried even more... `
`Watching that, another emotion welled up. `
`It welled up rapidly. `
`...And then, it burst. `
`After all, she refused to make up with me even though I'd apologized, and there was nothing else I could do now anyway, and it was all Maria's fault in the first place...!! `
`Since she's too busy playing with stuffed animals all the time like this, she can't make any friends, and that's why people treat her like a freak...!! `
`This is a perfect opportunity to give her some instructive guidance! `
`After all, it's not like I was pampered all the time...!! `
`Everything eventually breaks, is stolen, is destroyed by someone! `
`Even I had lots of toys and treasures stolen, broken, mocked, `
`and thrown away by my brothers and sister and Father and Mother...!! `
`But when I cried about that, ...while I might have shed a few tears, `
`...not once did I sob like this and trouble my parents, `
`throw a tantrum, get mad, `
`hit the floor and kick and make a racket...!! `
`Even though I always wanted to, I thought I'd get in more trouble if I did, so I always, always held it back. `
`{a:c: `
`It's because I held it in{n}ThAT i wAS ablE TO beCoMe THe WOnDerFuL aDULT i aM NOw!!!} `
`At that moment, I felt something strange. `
`The same feeling as when you use a tool recklessly, and it finally breaks, so that only the base is left. `
`But I wasn't using a tool. `
`I'd just been repeatedly hitting Maria's head with both hands. `
`So, ...I looked at my hands. `
`...From my wrists onwards, my hands had broken off, splintered, ...and disappeared. `
`As though only that part of my arms had become ceramic. `
`...No, as though all of me from the wrists onwards had suddenly become ceramic, and had broken and fallen. `
`They must have gotten filled with cracks because I hit Maria too much...before falling off. `
`...After all, look, ...aren't both of my wrists lying smashed by my feet...? `
`"Ee......? `
`Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekkk...!!!" `
`There was no pain. `
`But the shocking sight of my hands breaking off from the wrists onwards made me scream... `
`"Wh-What is this?! `
`What is this?! `
`My hands, ...my hands, my hands...!! `
`Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekkkk!!!" `
`"......... `
`......This way, ...you won't be able to hit me anymore." `
`Ignoring my confusion, ...Maria spoke with an icy voice, `
`...slowly moving her hands away from her head, where they had been defending against my barrage... `
`"...What's happening?! `
`My hands, my hands...!! `
`What did you do, Maria, what is this, what on earth is this...?!" `
`Behind Maria's back, a black silhouette had appeared. `
`...It was the silhouette of an adult. `
`......Who?! `
`"...If she'd used those hands for patting her daughter's head, flipping through picture books, or making warm meals, `
`...it may have been worth leaving them on." `
`"Mama hit my head more than she patted it. `
`...She never opens picture books. `
`She doesn't even make me food. `
`...I go to buy it myself." `
`"...But I mustn't go to the same store more than once, `
`mustn't have my face remembered, mustn't talk to the policeman... `
`......Why? `
`Why is that? `
`Is it my fault?" `
`"Am I not allowed to have Mama pat my head, have picture books read to me, `
`or eat dinner with Mama...? `
`Why not? `
`Why not?! `
`I didn't do anything wrong!! `
`It isn't my fault, it's Mama's!! `
`Mama's fault!!" `
`"Mama wouldn't play with me, but Sakutaro did! `
`He even read books, watched TV and ate meals with me!! `
`He was a much, much better friend than Mama was!!!" `
`"...I-I'm not proud of it...! `
`B-But what am I supposed to do?! `
`I'm busy with work, work I tell you!! `
`You know that, right?! `
`It was unavoidable!! `
`There's nothing I can do!!" `
`"True enough. `
`It was unavoidable. `
`Unavoidable that you'd injure your daughter, tearing her heart apart and making her tears run with blood...! `
`In that case, there's no avoiding the same thing happening again, right here, right now...!!" `
`"Come, {f:5:Maria}...! `
`Enough of the excuses from a woman who calls herself a mother. `
`Can you forgive her, or not...?! `
`Is she innocent...or guilty?!?!" `
`"I won't forgive her!! `
`Mama's guilty!! `
`I'll make Mama meet the same fate she gave to Sakutaro...!! `
`Take Mama...from the seam at the neck... `
`and tear her apart, so we can see the cotton inside her!!" `
`...Maria's eyes ominously flashed blue. `
`In that instant, invisible, massive arms stuck their fingernails out and tightly grasped Rosa's entire body. `
`As the bones all over her body made a sound like twigs being stepped on, they cracked readily and broke apart. `
`......Rosa had understood vaguely. `
`The massive arms were probably...her own arms, from the time she'd torn Sakutarou apart. `
`From a stuffed animal's perspective, her arms certainly would have been this massive. `
`So she could imagine what would happen next. `
`...The sharp nails stuck deep into the base of her neck, ...and she heard the skin tearing with her own ears. `
`Then, as the two witches watched over her, Rosa's flesh was split in two, top and bottom. `
`When Sakutarou had been torn apart, bits of cotton had flown about like snowflakes. `
`But in Rosa's case, something like black, thick tar came out, filthily flying all over the place. `
`There wasn't even a trace of the red of blood. `
`...It was something black, filthy and thick. `
`It was probably what a bloodless, tearless human kept inside their body. `
`"This is incredible. Hideous! `
`What filthy insides...! `
`Splendidly done, {f:5:Maria}. `
`Well then, is this enough for your revenge? `
`Can you forgive your mother, or not? `
`Innocent...or guilty...?!!" `
`"I can't forgive her!! `
`Still can't forgive her, she's guilty...!!!" `
`When {f:5:Beatrice} brandished her pipe cane, `
`gold butterflies seeped up and restored Rosa's broken flesh in an instant... `
`"......Ack, ...gwah! `
`*cough*cough*...!" `
`"Feel the depths of your sin, which cannot be repaid by a single human life. `
`And remember your own great sin...! `
`Come, try and remember...!! `
`Remember the scale of your sin...!!" `
`......Hello. `
`...Is it Mama? `
`...When will you get home? `
`"I'm sorry. `
`I'm busy with work today, so I'm staying over." `
`...Staying over for work again......? `
`...Looks like work is tough for you again today, Mama... `
`"Yeah, sorry. `
`I really am busy. `
`I'll be holed up in the company the whole time. `
`I can't even get a breath of outside air. `
`Mama just can't finish her job quickly this time. `
`Unless I give them a better design, I won't be given another job, ...that's how tough this work is. `
`So it'll just have to take some time." `
`...Yeah. `
`I understand. `
`......I'll be a good girl and watch over the house, so do your best at work, finish it quickly, and come back, okay...? `
`"Thank you for understanding about Mama's work... `
`I promise I'll buy a delicious cake tomorrow and take it home." `
`I don't need cake. `
`...Instead of taking time to go to the cake store, I'd be happier if you came home that much sooner. `
`"Don't worry. `
`I'll come back quickly, I promise. `
`So let's have some delicious cake together. `
`Let's drink delicious tea together. `
`Let's read a new picture book together. `
`Let's play with that Wolves and Sheep Puzzle I bought the other day. `
`Both of us together. `
`...I promise." `
`......Yeah, promise. `
`I'll be waiting. `
`......Do your best at work, Mama... `
`"Hohoh. `
`It's a lonely story, but isn't this mother-daughter love wonderful, with both looking out for the other? `
`Do you see any problem with it, Maria? Rosa?" `
`"............ `
`...I-I...kept that promise, didn't I? `
`The next evening, didn't I do as I promised, buying a cake and returning earlier than usual?" `
`"That's not it. I knew... `
`......That evening, `
`a pay-on-delivery package came for Mama, but there wasn't enough money in the wallet, `
`so I called Mama's company to ask what to do. `
`...I was told only to call at special times, `
`...but I thought it'd be bad if the package was something important for Mama's work... `
`So I called." `
`"............" `
`"......Then, I was told that Mama had the day off. `
`...I was told that it had been decided long ago that Mama would have that day off, ......and that she'd gone far away to play. `
`......I knew. `
`The whole, whole time, ......I knew Mama was lying...!" `
`But you know what? ...Sakutarou scolded me, saying that it wasn't true. `
`Every day, Mama was very busy with work. `
`There was no way she'd abandon Maria and play. `
`He said that the person who told us Mama had the day off must've made some kind of mistake...! `
`That's what Sakutaro said. `
`So I believed it. `
`...I believed it! `
`I love Mama, love her...! `
`Of course, Mama says that she loves me, loves me!! `
`"......Yes. `
`Me too. `
`I love you, Maria..." `
`Rosa let out a deep sigh. `
`...Maybe she felt the weight of her words. `
`Then, she set the receiver on the bedside phone down. `
`The dark room made the starry sky on the ground below the window stand out even more beautifully. `
`On the table in front of the terrace was a very cold wine cooler, `
`and the one she shared a glass with was gazing at the scene below... `
`"......You didn't tell your daughter you were on vacation?" `
`"I told her once, but she was so noisy that I decided not to tell her anymore. `
`It's less work that way." `
`"...If you were worried about your daughter, you didn't have to force yourself to put this in your schedule, right?" `
`"But that way, we'd never get our schedules to match... `
`Didn't I say not to worry about that?" `
`The slender, middle-aged man clad in a white robe gave a small sigh. `
`Rosa reacted instantly to that slight action... `
`"Come on! `
`Let's not talk about my daughter. `
`It'd be a waste of this precious wine." `
`"......I find you fascinating as both a woman and a human being. `
`But for that very reason, `
`I feel bad about taking so much of your time that it strains your relationship with your daughter." `
`"Don't I always tell you not to worry about my relationship with my daughter...?! `
`I try not to talk about her when I'm alone with you, okay? `
`I wouldn't even have phoned from here if it weren't for the noisy drunk laughing stupidly in the lobby downstairs...!" `
`"Rosa-san, `
`can't you reconsider taking sudden vacations like this in the future, for your daughter's sake...? `
`Isn't it enough if we only meet when our schedules match?" `
`"Our schedules will never match up that way, right...?! `
`And I...always want to be with you...!" `
`"That's a child's way of loving. `
`Loving between adults should be a little more stoic. `
`...Not being able to be with you for long periods of time makes me lonely too. `
`However, I think we can enjoy more than enough adult loving during that limited time." `
`"So you're telling me to go be with my daughter more. `
`...Be a mother, not a woman?" `
`"...That's what you want too, right? `
`You must also want to spend lots of time with your daughter. `
`I won't run away. `
`I'm trying to say that I think it's sad for you to sacrifice your daughter so you can prioritize your time with me." `
`"............ `
`...Did you get back on good terms with your wife? `
`......Looks like you've had about enough of being separated from her." `
`"I don't want to talk about my wife. `
`Just like you don't want to talk about your daughter." `
`"...I'm sure you think single women with children are a pain." `
`"I've never said anything of the sort before." `
`"......Whenever someone finds out I have a child, they desert me. `
`...Even if I tell them not to worry about paying that child's living expenses, they all desert me... `
`...I...thought you understood about my daughter, `
`......but I guess you don't like single women with children after all..." `
`"That's not what I'm saying. `
`I haven't started to dislike you, Rosa-san. `
`I'm just trying to tell you to take better care of our daughter, something I know you wish for yourself, `
`and I don't want you to hurt yourself by lying to her. `
`That's all I'm saying." `
`"Liar!!! `
`I've just become a burden for you, right?!" `
`"That's not what I'm saying...!" `
`"No, I know, I understand. `
`After being abandoned so many times because of that child, I know, `
`I can tell by your mood, yes, you're already like those other men!! `
`You don't want a woman with a child, you don't want a divorcee, because that's a pain!!" `
`"You don't want to become the parent of a child made with another man, right? `
`Yes, that's right, I totally get it!! `
`I once went out with a man with children, so I really get how you feel...!! `
`That's why...I believed I'd be able to be together with you, a person who understood about my daughter!!" `
`"Gwah!! `
`*cough*, ...*cough*... `
`...That's right... `
`You were...always in the way..." `
`"............!" `
`"...If only you didn't exist, ...I would've been able to grasp my happiness as a woman long ago... `
`Because you exist, ...you were always in the way of my happiness..." `
`"......Ma...ma......" `
`"......Even I didn't want you to be born... `
`No, that's not it. `
`...I thought I might be able to build a happy family together with you... `
`...But that man disappeared right before your birth. `
`He said he'd build a warm family with me, ...tricked me, ...and disappeared from my sight for all eternity...!!" `
`"Only you were left. `
`No love or memories or anything remained!! `
`Where did that man go? `
`He probably just turned my days with him into a warm memory...and met with a new love. `
`And this time, he might have been able to create a happy family...!! `
`And as for me?! `
`I have you!! `
`I can't even look for a new love!!" `
`"Men can go between women as they like and brag about it! `
`But for a woman, for me...!! `
`I have you!! `
`I had you as a stone weight, `
`and because of you, I can't search for romance, I can't find love, and I can only live alone!!" `
`"No, I wasn't even allowed that, I wasn't even allowed a night to drink myself drunk all alone!! `
`Who are you?! `
`Who?! `
`You wasted my life...and won't even let me have a new life... Just who are you to my life?! `
`Die, disappear, I've hated you since the time you were born!! `
`I've hated you since the time you were in my womb!!! `
`I've been doing my best to act like a good mother so that I'd be accepted by the outside world. `
`Yes, I've done my best!!" `
`"As I watched other women of my generation praise being single, sometimes playing with passion or even being joined with someone in love, `
`I was stuck being both a mother and a woman...!! `
`Who ever showed appreciation for my efforts?! `
`No one admired me, no one praised me!!" `
`"I got what I deserved? `
`Secondhand goods? `
`Divorcees should die? `
`You don't want anyone who's not a virgin?! `
`I'm the one who doesn't want anything to do with you, you damn inexperienced virgin brats!!! `
`I was so desperate, I probably looked like a easy woman to you...yes, I was desperate!! `
`You probably couldn't imagine how desperate a woman like me, who's still at the age where she wants to know love, was... `
`when I realized that my time was being filled with work and caring for my child `
`so that I'd probably grow old and end my life still like this!!" `
`"Of course I hate your real father too! `
`But we both share the blame for bringing about that catastrophe. `
`I myself might have been persistent enough to make him run away! `
`But the catastrophes after that were all your fault! `
`When did I ever scold you for that?! `
`Never, riiiiiiiight?!" `
`"The day after one man left me, when I wanted to drink myself dead drunk, was Parent's Day at your school!! `
`When I tried to hide my tear-stained eyes with heavy makeup, `
`the way I felt when you said something off the mark and the whole class laughed at you... `
`is something that not only you, but probably everyone in the world couldn't understand!! `
`I hate you, loathe you...!!! `
`And until now, I've never really loved you even once!!! `
`Whhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!" `
`Maria's face was still stiff... `
`If the words really had been blades, `
`...Maria's whole body would probably be stained red with fresh blood by now. `
`Even after gaining the power of a witch and resolving herself to take revenge for Sakutaro, `
`...she couldn't stand these curses coming out of her mother's mouth... `
`"............Ma.........ma.................. `
`...Uuuwau... `
`Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!!" `
`"Ugly. `
`Aaaaaaaahh, how ugly is a woman drowning in lust...!! `
`Now you see this woman's true nature!! `
`Even I, as a witch who has explored the depths of evil, find this most difficult to watch!!" `
`"Aaah, {f:5:Maria}, now is the time to part from her!! `
`Smash the ugly lump of meat that calls herself your mother...!! `
`It would be pointless for your pure soul to be bound by the chains between mother and daughter any longer! `
`With your own hand! `
`Release your own soul now!! `
`You have now gained the tooth and claw to protect yourself!!" `
`"Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!! `
`Now you'll taste the pain I had to go through...! `
`Now I'll take revenge for those days of suffering...!!!" `
`"Ahhahahahahahahahaha!! `
`Aren't you the one who's been hurting me?! `
`I'm the one who wants revenge...!! `
`I should have done that before you were born!! `
`If only you hadn't been born!! `
`Disappeeeeeeeeeeeaaaar, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!! `
`"......ggyah—" `
`As Rosa howled, in a way that can only be described by the word *splat*, her upper body was crushed, `
`and in an instant, became something similar to a wrung, bloodstained towel. `
`"Be crushed. `
`I can't forgive you, ...can't forgive you...!!" `
`"Kuhhahhahha...!! `
`What filth. `
`That form suits you...!" `
`...Even though Rosa's waist and below was standing normally, `
`just the upper half of her body had been pinched, and that extreme contrast was bizarre. `
`Then, she fell over, but the instant she fell, her body was restored. `
`"*cough*cough*! `
`*cough*!! `
`......YOU die. `
`...Kuhhihihhihhihhi...!" `
`"Come, Maria. `
`Is this the limit of your anger and sadness? `
`Now is the time for revenge! `
`Time for the settlement of anger and sadness...!! `
`Hit her, spit it out!! `
`Push out all of the wedges driven into your chest...and fling them back at her!!!" `
`"Uugaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhoooooooooooooohhhh!!!" `
`Maria's howl was adorned with the ugly sound of flesh and bone being crushed at the same time... `
`As Rosa, who had foully insulted Maria, lay spread-eagled, `
`a neat, perfect circle was cut out of her chest and crushed, as though her chest had been trampled by an invisible elephant. `
`Her heart and her lungs and her ribs were trampled so mercilessly that they were completely indistinguishable. `
`...It might have symbolized the pain in Maria's heart up until today. `
`"So, Maria, `
`are you satisfied now? `
`Can you forgive your mother for her sin? `
`Or not? `
`Innocent? `
`Or guilty?!" `
`"I can't forgive her!! `
`Not yet, not yet!! `
`Mama is guilty, guilty guilty guilty, can't forgive her!!!" `
`"Indeed, how could this level of punishment compare to the bitter days you suffered through?!! `
`Know it, Rosa! `
`Come, try to remember, what form did you have?! `
`Revive in order to be killed!! `
`Be killed over and over, so that your sins can be purified!!!" `
`When Beato waved her cane, the body was restored again, `
`and Rosa sat up, coughing violently in apparent pain... `
`And once again, she spat out curses rejecting Maria. `
`"......You aren't Mama. `
`You're a witch, a witch tormenting me and Mama!! `
`I won't forgive you just because you look like Mama! `
`I won't forgive you!!" `
`"...You're the witch, aren't you...? `
`Always reading creepy books and pretending to play with witches...!! `
`You're the one who should disappeeeeeeeeeeeear!! `
`Because of you, even I'm treated like a freak! `
`Because of you, because of yooooooooooooouuuuuuu!!! `
`If only you hadn't been born!! `
`Don't be born...!! `
`I've hated you since before you were boooooooooooorn!!!" `
`"Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh...!!!" `
`......Maria screamed. `
`Was she unable to bear her anger and sadness? `
`Or else, had she been taken over by an indescribable emotion...? `
`It was surely...a cry of hopelessness. `
`And yet, it was a reality that had to be accepted. `
`Maria knew. `
`She knew that she was thought of as a burden. `
`But even though she herself had known that, she didn't believe it. `
`She'd believed that her mother loved her...and had done her best to positively interpret several events that could have made her doubt this, `
`...trusting and clinging to her mother's love. `
`But, ......she had no one except Mama. `
`Even so, she really did like Mama... `
`and wanted to return to the days when she'd believed that Mama loved her... `
`So I howled... `
`I'll erase all of it. `
`I won't accept it. `
`I'll deny it. `
`I'll deny the mother who says these things, the black witch who makes her say them, `
`and......the part of myself that can't forgive my mother...!!! `
`But I can't deny it! `
`This is reality, fact, the truth, the answer. `
`Without any mistake, this is absolute...reality!! `
`Maria turned Rosa into a lump of meat over and over. `
`Over and over, in the dark world that reflected her heart, `
`rang the ugly sound of flesh and bone being torn apart, which would make anyone want to cover their ears... `
`Each time, {f:5:Beatrice} revived Rosa. `
`She dragged her back into the world of endless torture, which could not be escaped from even by death. `
`This was the true, deepest hell that the Endless Witch {f:5:Beatrice} could create. `
`However, this world was not made endless by {f:5:Beatrice}'s will. `
`...Because every time Rosa turned into a lump of meat, she asked the same question to Maria. `
`*cackle*cackle*! `
`Are you satisfied, {f:5:Maria}?! `
`Can your anger forgive your mother yet?!" `
`"How could I forgive her, how could I forgive her?!! `
`I won't forgive, won't forgive her!! `
`I'll teach you all of my pain...!! `
`Teach you much, much more...!! `
`It's still not enough, not close to enough...!! `
`Since I was born, since before I was born...!! `
`I can't get rid of the anger and sadness of being neglected so long...!!" `
`"......Fuhi, hahaha... `
`...I hate you, haaate you... `
`Fuhihiha, haha..." `
`"Ugaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!" `
`Revive over and over again. `
`Return to a meat lump over and over again. `
`In various ways, she crushed, smashed, beat, and tore to bits. `
`Flying blood spatter and flesh turned the once pitch-black world into a world with mixed red and black. `
`Maria's anger still hadn't calmed down. `
`It was as though she was spitting out all of the suppressed rage from the time of her birth until today. `
`If that all became poison to her heart... `
`Then would the repeated murder of her mother purify her soul...? `
`Would even this wasteful murder save her soul, at least a little bit...? `
`This endless torture...might have become a slight diversion from her sad, unrewarded life. `
`After all, ...it seemed that she'd finally been able to regain her smile. `
`"Learn it!! `
`You, the source of my unhappiness!! `
`Learn it!! `
`Learn that what you're feeling is nothing compared to my pain!! `
`Kihhihihahhahahaha!! `
`What's wrong? `
`Why'd you stop laughing?! `
`Try and laaaaaaauuugh!!" `
`"...Fuhi, fuhihihi... `
`Gyack...!!!" `
`Half of her skull collapsed. `
`Eyeballs flew out and black cranial fluid gushed. `
`Fragments of teeth scattered. `
`"Come on, revive...!! `
`Try and laugh...!! `
`Come on, come oooooon!!!" `
`"......Ihi, ...ihi. `
`...Gyaggh!!" `
`Her whole chest along with her ribs turned inside out, exposing her filthy innards. `
`All of them writhed, like some kind of impure creature. `
`"Come on, come on, come on!! `
`Revive!! `
`Can you still laugh? `
`Can you still laugh?! `
`Kihhihihihihi?!" `
`"............" `
`Rosa couldn't laugh anymore. `
`...But her face was laughing. `
`It was filled with a twisted laugh...and covered with a malice that rejected her unwanted daughter. `
`I erased that laughing voice. `
`Next, I'll erase that laughing face. `
`I'll erase it, I'll crush it, I'll tear it to bits...!! `
`"Laugh, try and laugh, Mama...!! `
`Kihhihihihihhahahahahahahahaha?! `
`What's wrong, Mama, let's wake up, read a picture book, and go take a walk...!! `
`Let's say we love each other, make a promise for next Sunday, let's go shopping, let's go to the movies...!! `
`And of course you'll break that promise!!" `
`"Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihi, isn't it fun, Mama? Isn't it fun, Mama? I'm playing with Mama now, right?!! `
`Kihhihhahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!" `
`"That's right, you are now playing with your mother, having fun with her...!! `
`Tell me how you feel right now! `
`I don't believe it's anger or sadness or pain...!" `
`"Yeah, that's right, I get it, {f:5:Beatrice}...!! `
`I'm having a lot of fun now... I'm playing with Mama, so it's tons of fun!! `
`And even though I'm killing Mama over and over again, she can be revived with just a single bit of magic!! `
`I took care of my toys because I couldn't fix them if they broke...!! `
`But if the toy could be fixed, I'd want to break it over and over again!! `
`Kihhihihihihihihihihihihi!! `
`Hihihihihihi, hihi......" `
`"...But......Sakutaro won't be fixed. `
`...He can't be fixed...... `
`......Because Mama, who made him, `
`...Mama, who gave birth to him, `
`...won't acknowledge him." `
`"............" `
`"I wasn't acknowledged by Mama either, was I...? `
`...So the broken Maria won't be fixed either. `
`............ `
`......Kihihihi. `
`Kihhihihihihihihihihihihi!! `
`Kyahhahahahahyahhyahhyahhyah!! `
`Aaaaaaaaaaahhh, it's fun, it's fun, Mama...!! `
`Since it's gotten so fun, I'm somehow starting to feel that I could forgive you...! `
`Hey, Beato, this is a veeery strange feeling...! `
`Why? `
`Why am I starting to feel like I can forgive Mama?!" `
`"That enlightened state is only reached by witches who have gained the power to control life and death at will. `
`...You can kill at any time. `
`You can revive her if needed. `
`If that's a pain, then it's all right to kill her again...! `
`Once you've learned that you can do this at any time by simply snapping your fingers, all nonsense spoken in the world of humans becomes a chirping of insects that isn't worth listening to...!" `
`"You didn't begin to think about forgiving your mother because your eyes were opened to your mother's love. `
`It was because now, `
`you stand at the entrance to the world of true witches...!! `
`Welcome, Maria, to the profound and sweet world of witches!!" `
`"I've done it...!! `
`Maria is no longer Maria...!! `
`I may still be an apprentice, but I've surpassed the Human world...! `
`I am now...the apprentice Witch of Origins, {f:5:Maria}...!!! `
`There's nothing to frustrate me, nothing to make me sad!" `
`"Mama, I'll forgive you. `
`I'm sure I can forgive you! `
`I think I'll be able to forgive you after doing just a bit more!! `
`After all, I'm a witch!! `
`Ki......hihhi{0}hi{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hhihhi!" `
`Ki, ...hihhihihhihhihhihhihhihhi! `
`Maria would probably forgive her mother eventually. `
`...After brutally murdering her countless times. `
`Graciously. `
`"......Whoa, that last thunder was loud. `
`Must've been pretty close, right?" `
`"Looks like it. `
`No matter how old you get, thunder still makes you jump." `
`Battler was looking at the dark night through a crack in the curtains. `
`Every once in a while, a pale, white lightning bolt would shine, and he seemed to be enjoying it. `
`"............" `
`"...Oh? `
`Look, you were so noisy, you woke Maria up. `
`Sorry, Maria. `
`Sorry Battler's so freaking loud...!" `
`"What the hell, so it's my fault? `
`Sorry, Maria. `
`It's okay to go back to sleep. `
`Good night." `
`Maria was a bit hazy, with drowsy eyes. `
`...She was probably half-asleep and couldn't think straight. `
`".........Uu-. `
`...That's okay. `
`I won't sleep." `
`"Nah, go ahead and sleep. `
`You're still half-asleep, aren't you? `
`Ihihi." `
`"...I'm not half-asleep! `
`......Uu-!!" `
`"Come on, you're totally half-asleep, aren't you? `
`Sleep, sleeeep." `
`"I'm not half-asleep! Not half-asleep!! `
`Uu-uu-!! `
`Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!" `
`"Quit it, stupid Battler...! `
`Aah, sheesh, what are you thinking, getting a kid who's just woken up into a bad mood...?!" `
`"I'm not half-asleep! `
`Not half-asleep! `
`Uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-!!!" `
`"I understand, Maria-chan... `
`You aren't half-asleep. `
`So calm down..." `
`"Not half-asleep, not half-asleep!! `
`Uu-!! `
`Uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-!!" `
`Maybe it was because of her delicate mental state after waking up, but Maria suddenly threw a tantrum. `
`Battler had only been trying to tease her a bit, `
`so he was confused by this extreme overreaction. `
`George held her head, trying to calm her down, but Maria's tantrum wasn't going to be quelled easily. `
`Battler and Jessica were trying to push the blame on each other, saying "It's your fault" 'It's your fault too'. `
`"Hey, be quiet, you two...! `
`Jessica-chan, there was still some hot water in the pot, right? `
`Could you make some tea for her? `
`......Did you calm down, `
`Maria-chan?" `
`"......Uuuu---." `
`It looked like her tantrum was dying down bit by bit, `
`but she still glared at Battler, who had made fun of her, with sharp eyes. `
`"Battler-kun was just kidding around. `
`He doesn't really think you're half-asleep. `
`So calm down. `
`Okay? `
`............?" `
`"............" `
`George noticed. `
`...Maria was staring at Battler with incredible eyes. `
`And, ...despite having just displayed all that emotion, ...she laughed in a small voice. `
`{a:c: `
`Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.} `
`Instead of a laugh, it seemed more like she was muttering while thinking about, `
`or else counting, each "hi". `
`As though each time she said "hi", something brutal would happen over and over. `
`George felt something creepy for just an instant, `
`...but he couldn't spot the madness that peeked out of the depths of the girl's eyes for just a moment. `
`After a short period of stunned silence on George's part, `
`Maria stopped her bizarre, quiet laugh and pushed George's arm aside, as though telling him to let go. `
`"......Uu-. `
`I'll forgive him." `
`"R-Really? `
`You're such a good girl, Maria. `
`...Battler-kun, Maria-chan forgave you. `
`Make up." `
`"Yeah, sorry for teasing you. `
`Forgive me..." `
`"Hey, Maria... `
`Let's make some cafe au lait as a sign that you've made up. `
`I'll put in lots of sugar, so it'll be sweet." `
`"I don't need it. `
`But I'll forgive you. `
`......Because I'm a witch. `
`...Kihihihi." `
`One more time, Maria laughed in a creepy, quiet voice. `
`But it was only for a very short time, so Battler and Jessica didn't think much of it. `
`...They decided to think that... `
`it had probably only looked that way when the lightning lit her cheek with a pale, white light for an instant. `
`At that time, they could hear the sound of loud footsteps coming from the hall. `
`It was already about 10:30, late at night. `
`Late at night is usually a time when you aren't supposed to be disturbed. `
`Hearing footsteps like that at this time was far from calming... `
`Then, along with a clearly ominous knock that repeated fiercely, they could hear Gohda and Kumasawa's voices. `
`...That clearly told them that this was an abnormal situation. `
`"Children...!! `
`Are you there? Are you there?! `
`It's Gohda!" `
`"It's Kumasawa, is everyone okay?! `
`Aaaaaaah, what has happened, what has happened...?!" `
`When George opened the door, the two of them tumbled in, sopping wet. `
`It looked like they had dashed here from the mansion without an umbrella. `
`"Wh-What's wrong, you two...? `
`Did something happen...?!" `
`"I-It was, it was...!! `
`Th‐th‐the Master—{nobr:Krauss‐sama}—{nobr:everyone, he}— `
`awawa{0}wa{0}wa{0}wa{0}wa{0}wawawa..." `
