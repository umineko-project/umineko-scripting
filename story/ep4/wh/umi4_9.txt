`.......................................... `
`‘........................Uryu... `
`.........Maria, ...answer me......’ `
`"..........................." `
`‘.........Uryu... `
`......So I really am... `
`a stuffed animal...? `
`...I'm made of cloth and cotton, `
`...so there's no way I can... `
`talk...? `
`...So, `
`...I can't talk to Maria......?’ `
`Sakutaro looked up at Maria sadly. `
`Maria's face was covered with tears, and it looked as though it had even lost all traces of sadness... `
`"......Uu-. `
`...I hear you, Sakutaro. `
`...You aren't a stuffed animal made of cloth and cotton. `
`......You are...my friend. `
`......I hate Ange. `
`...Uuuuuuuuuuuu..." `
`‘Uryu... Sorry, Maria. Sorry, Maria...! `
`Uryu...!’ `
`Sakutaro regretted doing that. `
`By freezing her heart, Maria had finally been able to escape from her sadness. `
`...By speaking up and calling her back, he'd caused her to be overwhelmed with sadness again... `
`Sakutaro tried hugging Maria, letting go of her, `
`and gazing at her uneasily, lost as to how he could bring Maria's spirits up. `
`...He might've looked a little humorous doing that. `
`In the end, that was enough to distract Maria from her sadness... `
`"Sorry. `
`......Crying won't help anything anymore." `
`‘You got in a fight with Ange, but you still have lots of friends, Maria... `
`I'm not the only one. `
`......Everyone's here. `
`Sakusuke and Sakukichi, the animal band, and many, many more...’ `
`Maria looked at the many stuffed animals around her pillow, which were gathered together as though they were having an idle chat. `
`‘...Everyone...is worried about you, Maria. `
`They're all talking over and over about how to cheer you up, okay...?’ `
`"............ `
`...Everyone won't...go away...like Ange...?" `
`‘They won't. `
`We'll always be together.’ `
`"......Really? `
`All of you are only with me at home. `
`We can't go out together when Mama's around, and we can't go to school." `
`‘You aren't supposed to take us to school, so you'll get in trouble if the teacher finds out. `
`But if no one finds out, we can be together at any time.’ `
`"...Sakutaro, you're big, so you'd be found." `
`‘Then you can take one of the kids that are small enough to walk around with. `
`...For example, ...what about them? `
`If you take the friends in the forest band, `
`...look, they're small, so you can hide them in your pocket and go to school together.’ `
`"......There's a lot of them in the band. `
`I can't fit them all in my pocket." `
`She collected all of the forest band pieces that were scattered across her bed. `
`There were about as many of them as pieces in a chess set, so it'd probably be impossible to fit them all in her pocket... `
`‘In that case, you can just take friends that you're especially close with. `
`...You can take the four rabbits, your best friends in the forest band.’ `
`"...I could fit four in my pockets. `
`...Yeah. `
`This way, they won't be found." `
`‘Now, you won't be alone even at school, Maria. `
`Those kids will be with you even where I can't go.’ `
`"......Yeah. `
`...Maybe...I won't be lonely that way. `
`...Maybe I can hold out...until coming home from school..." `
`‘As long as we aren't found by the teacher and Mama, we can be with you at any time. `
`So let's be together, play together forever. `
`We definitely won't leave you all alone, Maria. `
`Uryu!’ `
`Maria's expression finally regained a little of its brightness. `
`...That's right. `
`In the beginning, Maria's world didn't have Ange in it. `
`Even without Ange, it was fun with everyone. `
`And yet, strangely enough, it suddenly became sad without Ange, who had come in at the end. `
`...All that's happened is that I've returned to the world right before Ange entered it. `
`...So there's nothing to be sad about. `
`"...Yeah. `
`I'm not lonely. `
`Sakutaro and the others are with me." `
`‘Uryuu! `
`Loooove you, Maria...!’ `
`"I won't let any more Humans come into my world. `
`...Mariage Sorcière is an alliance between me and {f:5:Beatrice} only. `
`...From the start, even {f:5:Beatrice} didn't want to let Ange join. `
`......It's all right this way. `
`Ange was still too young." `
`‘...For now, until you can be friends with Ange again, I think it's okay to forget about it. `
`You can play together once you've regained your high spirits, Maria. `
`Until then, all of us will be by your side.’ `
`"......Thank you. `
`...Sakutaro, ...everyone." `
`Then, Maria once again regained her former world. `
`She regained the world that wasn't lonely, where she was surrounded by many friends. `
`Just like usual, she didn't have any Human friends at school, but her magic friends were always with her. `
`The rabbit band she hid in her pockets talked with her during class, sounding like they were having fun. `
`Just listening to that greatly embellished the time she spent in class. `
`Maria made it so that, as long as Mama and the teacher didn't find out, her other friends could always be with her. `
`When Mama told Maria to go play outside, Maria would secretly pack Sakutaro and Sakusuke and the rest into her bag and play together at the library or somewhere. `
`Even when Mama was late coming home and Maria went shopping for dinner, she always went with Sakutaro. `
`The man at the convenience store and the other people were nice to Sakutaro. `
`He sometimes gave a second portion free for Maria and Sakutaro. `
`When Mama found out, Maria would get in trouble for bringing Sakutaro and the rest outside. `
`When the teacher found out, Maria would get in trouble for bringing toys to school. `
`The toxin must be strong in Mama and the teacher. `
`That's why Sakutaro looks like a normal stuffed animal to them. `
`After all, the convenience store man and the others say hello to Sakutaro. `
`......Not all Humans are hopeless. `
`There are tons of people who, unlike Ange and Mama and teacher, can say hello to magic friends like I can... `
`"Oh, Maria-chan. `
`Welcome. `
`Was your Mama late coming home tonight too...?" `
`"Yeah. `
`...But I've got Sakutaro, so I'm not lonely. `
`Right, Sakutaro?" `
`‘Uryu. `
`It's not just Sakutaro today. `
`Some other friends came too.’ `
`"Oh, other friends, is it? `
`What kind of friends did you bring today?" `
`"Today, the rabbits from the forest band are also with me. `
`...Look, in my pocket." `
`Maria began to line up four ceramic rabbit dolls on the register. `
`As the owner of the shop looked at it, smiling, he sent a signal to a part-timer with his chin. `
`Then, the sign on the other register that said "closed" was taken down, and a voice called out for everyone to move over there. `
`All of the people in line behind Maria lined up behind that one... `
`"I see, I see. `
`You do have a lot of friends, Maria-chan. `
`But I hope your Mama comes home soon." `
`"Uu-. `
`Mama's busy with work again, so she's spending the night at the company. `
`It's been very busy lately. `
`...She hasn't even been able to get much time to talk to me on the telephone. `
`But I'm not lonely! `
`I've got Sakutaro and the rest! `
`Right?" `
`‘Uryu-!!’ `
`"I've even got all the rabbits from the band. `
`Look. `
`Kyu-kyu-{p:0:♪}" `
`"Is kyu-kyu- the sound a rabbit makes? `
`My, I've never heard that." `
`After smiling at Sakutaro, who was poking his head out of her knapsack, `
`she played around with the rabbit band on the register, making them frolic around. `
`Although the shop manager gazed at this pleasantly, he had slightly pitying look on his face. `
`...This was apparently a single mother household, where the mother had to work hard and couldn't come home very often. `
`On top of that, it looked like this girl didn't even have any friends. `
`As he watched her play around happily with her dolls and claim that she wasn't lonely despite everything, `
`he couldn't help but feel a kind of compassion. `
`And actually, this wasn't limited to him alone. `
`Maria had become quite famous in this shopping district... `
`"Maria-chan, you should eat some oden every once in a while. `
`If you don't eat your eggs and fish paste, you won't get big." `
`"Uu-? `
`Can't get a cream roll...?" `
`‘Uryu. `
`If you don't eat certain things, you won't get big. `
`How about oden for today?’ `
`"Uu-. `
`...Then I'll have some oden." `
`"Yep, yep, that's the ticket. `
`Why don't I stick a whole bunch in there? `
`Want mustard?" `
`‘Uryu. `
`I can't handle spicy things...’ `
`"I see, I see. `
`Then, you make sure you don't let it spill on the way home. `
`It'll sure be delicious while it's hot." `
`"Uu-. `
`Thank you." `
`She had planned on getting some sweet pastries for dinner, but since oden had been recommended to her, she would be having that tonight instead. `
`Letting someone else determine the menu makes for an unexpected and interesting meal. `
`...Very often, Maria had to decide what her dinner would be on her own, so it was easy for the menus to get a little one-sided. `
`So, it felt fun to have a meal she hadn't anticipated... `
`‘Uryu-! `
`Thanks for giving us extra, Mister!’ `
`"Send my regards to your other friends at home. `
`No stuffing yourself on your way back. `
`Go straight home and eat it there." `
`"Uu-! `
`Thanks Mister!!" `
`Maria raised the bag with the oden container high... `
`"............ `
`......Huh...?" `
`‘...Uryu? `
`What is it, Maria?’ `
`"......The key isn't in my pocket." `
`Standing in front of the door to her house, Maria searched all over her body. `
`...The key to the house wasn't there. `
`She always methodically put it in the same pocket. `
`So there was no way she had put it in another pocket, but she searched her whole body just in case. `
`...Unsurprisingly, it wasn't there. `
`‘Did you drop it when you took your wallet out...?’ `
`"No. `
`When I took my wallet out, I definitely felt it. `
`I also felt it when I searched my pocket partway here. `
`...It was there until partway. `
`I didn't drop it! `
`Uu-uu-uu-...!" `
`Even though the late autumn wind had been bearable when Maria had been thinking of returning home, where the heater was, `
`now that she was confused and had lost her key, that wind tormented her. `
`But no matter how hard she searched, she couldn't find her key. `
`She turned out all her pockets and even tried taking off her jacket and hitting it, but to no avail. `
`...Of course, she also turned the knapsack Sakutaro was in upside down, but the key didn't come out. `
`"......Uu-. `
`......Uu-uu-uu-!!!" `
`Something that should have been there...wasn't where it was supposed to be. `
`Why isn't the key there, when I didn't do anything wrong? `
`...Why isn't it?! `
`Why?! `
`Why...?!!! `
`Maria was cold and frustrated and angry, and she stamped on the ground... `
`The bottom of her foot throbbed, but that didn't lessen her frustration. `
`...At the same time, her tears poured out. `
`"...Uu-. `
`...Uu-!! `
`Uuuu---!!" `
`It wasn't her fault. `
`So, it was someone else's fault. `
`But Maria didn't know who that someone was...and could do nothing but continue to let out a moan of anger. `
`‘...Uryu... `
`I'm sure you dropped it partway... `
`Let's look for it, okay? `
`Let's return on the road we came by and search, okay...?’ `
`"...Uu-... `
`Even though I went to all the trouble of buying oden...and got eggs and stuff for free... `
`I won't be able to eat it while it's hot... `
`......Uuuu----!!!" `
`‘...Maria, ...I know it's frustrating, but let's search, okay...? `
`It's no one's fault, so let's search...’ `
`Maria finally lent an ear to Sakutaro's words and began to trod back down the road she had come on. `
`...The wind was colder than before, and it felt like it was blowing in through the corners of her jacket in a mean way... `
`‘Uryu... `
`Let's watch our feet closely and search, okay...? `
`Then let's get home quickly, let the heater warm us up, and eat oden, all right? `
`I'm sure it'll be delicious.’ `
`"......Uu-. `
`...Gone. `
`...Uu-. `
`...It's gone..." `
`As Sakutaro encouraged her, Maria searched for the key... `
`But she made it all the way back to the convenience store where she'd bought the oden. `
`...She hadn't found it. `
`Just in case, she asked the man at the convenience store whether they had found a dropped key, `
`but they hadn't found anything. `
`...One more time, she returned home, paying close attention to the area around her feet. `
`But, unsurprisingly, she didn't find it. `
`She was no longer frustrated enough to stomp her feet. `
`...But hot tears dripped down her face. `
`The oden had cooled down completely. `
`...Even though she had been told it would be delicious when warm, she hadn't been able to eat it. `
`...Even though that man had given her so much free stuff... `
`‘...Uryu... `
`Don't cry... `
`...Mama isn't coming back tonight. `
`...Let's do our best and search...’ `
`"......Why can't I find it...? `
`...Uuuu, ...uuuuuuuu!" `
`‘Maria, don't cry...! `
`Let's do our best and search...! `
`......Maria...’ `
`Maria was no longer able to hold back her tears. `
`Sobbing, she clutched Sakutaro and held the bag of oden, returning once more down the road she had come by. `
`Perhaps because more and more houses and stores had turned their lights off by now, it was even darker and harder to search than before. `
`...And, once again without finding the key, she returned to the convenience store. `
`"Maria-chan, `
`...still can't find your key...?" `
`"...Uu-... `
`...My key... It's gone..." `
`"Wasn't your mother away for the night? `
`So, you can't get into your house without a key?" `
`"Uu-... `
`...Can't get in..." `
`"Well, that's not good... `
`Did you try going to the police? `
`They might be able to help you." `
`"......Mama said not to talk to policemen, even if they start talking to me." `
`"Oh? Well, why is that?" `
`"............" `
`It was probably because Rosa would be liable for making such a young girl like Maria watch over the house by herself, `
`and because she knew that this wasn't something that would be permitted by society. `
`So, Maria was indoctrinated into changing the stores she bought things at, so that she didn't catch the eyes of adults, `
`and into saying no more than a greeting to policemen, even if they talked to her. `
`Maria had obediently done as she was told. `
`Instead of considering why she must do that, `
`she was much more concerned with meekly obeying because her mother had told her so. `
`But the manager of the convenience store probably didn't think of it that way. `
`...In the first place, seeing such a young girl being forced to watch over the house alone, and so frequently, `
`...would make anyone worry... `
`...And then. `
`After making the round trip between her home and the store once more...and arriving at the convenience store for a third time... `
`...A policeman was there. `
`"It's that child. `
`...Maria-chan, did you find your key?" `
`"......Uu-... `
`...Didn't find it..." `
`"What's your name, miss?" `
`"........." `
`The policeman asked her name, but Maria didn't answer. `
`"Did your mother tell you not to talk to policemen? `
`Heheheh! `
`Don't worry, no need to be scared of me. `
`Have you eaten dinner yet, miss?" `
`"......I bought some, but I couldn't get into my house, so I couldn't eat it." `
`"What's your mother doing? `
`Is she not coming home tonight? `
`Is it her work?" `
`"......Uu-." `
`"Do you know how we can contact your mother at work?" `
`"........." `
`Maria hung her head limply. `
`...She didn't understand why the policeman was getting mad at her. `
`No, he probably wasn't getting mad at her, but if this reached her mother's ears, then she would definitely be in trouble. `
`Even if she didn't understand the reason why she would be in trouble, she at least understood that much. `
`But the policeman wouldn't let Maria go. `
`And her head was swimming from hunger. `
`The policeman noticed that, and it was decided that he'd listen to her story as they ate in the police box. `
`...Maria was taken to the police box. `
`She had her oden heated in a microwave oven, and even salty rice cakes and hot tea were brought out for her. `
`She had been told not to talk to policemen, `
`...but after being asked about Sakutaro, she responded, starting to feel that this wasn't a bad person. `
`...And anyway, she wouldn't be able to return home now, so she didn't know what to do. `
`......She told him Mama's work phone number, `
`...which she had been told to tell no one of and to use only in a very, very serious situation. `
`In the tatami room inside the police box, as she ate the oden that was so hot it felt like it would burn her, `
`she watched the policeman making the phone call, lazily thinking, ..."Aah, I'm probably gonna get in trouble". `
`"......Will Mama...get mad at me......?" `
`‘...Uryu......’ `
`He must have been listening to the phone ringing for a very long time. `
`With the receiver up to his ear, the policeman looked up at the clock, grumbling. `
`"......Maybe they aren't picking up because their business hours are over. `
`...Hmmmmmm. `
`...Huh? `
`Hello? `
`Hello? `
`Is this Anti-Rosa Ltd.? `
`This is the Komatsugawa Police Department police box in front of Senbonzakura Station. `
`Is President...umm...{c:86EF9C:Udaikan}...no, wait, President Ushiromiya available? `
`......Yes. `
`...What? `
`She's on vacation?" `
`"Yes. `
`Starting yesterday, the president has been on a three-day vacation. `
`Umm, is there some business you have with her...?" `
`"Oh no, no, no, never mind. `
`So, do you know where she might be? `
`You haven't heard where to contact her, have you?" `
`"Sure, ...could you hold on for a second? `
`......Hey, anyone heard where the president went for her vacation? `
`Or how to contact her?" `
`"I heard she was going for all-you-can eat crabs in Sapporo with her boyfriend. `
`Aaaw, I'm sure such a cold place will do wonders for shrinking the distance between them, don't you? `
`I haven't heard how to contact them." `
`"Yep, understood. `
`...Um, hello. `
`I hear she went to Sapporo, but I'm not sure about how to reach her. `
`...Should I take a message?" `
`"Hmm, I see, what a shame. `
`Well then, if you manage to get in touch with her again, could you tell her that we called? `
`Sure, yes." `
`...After that, I was taken to the police department, which was even bigger, `
`and ended up spending the night there. `
`Then, they asked me various things about myself. `
`A lady who called herself the district welfare officer came by and asked about a lot of things. `
`And I was told "You poor thing". `
`When I heard that, I learned for the first time. `
`"......Am I......a poor thing...?" `
`‘...Uryu... `
`That's not true, ...you're happy, Maria...’ `
`"......Uu-..." `
`Then, ...Rosa came back. `
`Maria was told to go to her room, `
`...but on her way back from the bathroom, she hid by the entrance to the living room and listened in on the exchange. `
`The person who had come to visit...was the female district welfare officer who had asked Maria various questions on that other day. `
`"You can't be so pushy!! `
`Maria's heart is too innocent and delicate, so if there was an insensitive kid there, she could be hurt!! `
`Please stop your pointless meddling!!" `
`"But in that case, Miss, `
`if the child is so delicate, why leave her home all alone? `
`Shouldn't a mother be together with her child?" `
`"I am together with her as much as I should be!! `
`I don't need to take instructions from you for something like that...!!" `
`"Oh, really? `
`She's very well known in this area. `
`They say your daughter frequently goes out at night to buy things and eat. `
`Everyone was worried and looking out for her." `
`"How do you know that was my child?!! `
`There's got to be plenty of children around this town, right?!! `
`Don't just suddenly decide that it's my Maria!! `
`Kids sometimes walk around outside at night, right?! `
`How can you prove that they were all my child?!" `
`"It's well-known around the shopping center... `
`that a girl holding a lion stuffed animal often stops by to eat dinner and buy things. `
`Everyone treated Maria-chan with care out of concern for her. `
`Sometimes, people even escorted her home, thinking the night roads might be dangerous, you see?" `
`"Y-You can find lion stuffed animals anywhere!! `
`It was none of their business, escorting her home!! `
`Are they thinking of kidnapping Maria?! `
`Don't bother her!! `
`Maria is my child. `
`I am raising her! `
`I have no intention of putting her in some strange institution!! `
`Stop your needless meddling!!" `
`‘U-Uryu... `
`Does that lion stuffed animal... `
`mean me...?’ `
`"...It's okay. `
`I'm the one in trouble... `
`It has nothing to do with you, Sakutaro..." `
`Maria hugged Sakutaro, continuing to watch her mother fearfully... `
`"I-I also wish I could be with Maria every day! `
`But I'm a single mother, so I have to work! `
`I may not look it, but I'm a president of a company, and I bear responsibility for my employees' well-being!! `
`I'm busy with my work all year round, so there's no time for me to rest!!" `
`"Reeally? `
`But you've been on vacation these last three days, haven't you?" `
`"I-I have not been on vacation! `
`I've stayed at my company all night, working!! `
`There's a mountain of matters to be taken care of that the other unreliable employees can't handle!!" `
`"Why are you lying like that? `
`Someone from your company said that you were taking a three-day vacation, you see? `
`You went to Hokkaido with your boyfriend, right? `
`Leaving your daughter by herself for three whole days...!" `
`"I-I don't know anything about this boyfriend I don't know anything about Hokkaido!!! `
`Where are you getting this nonsense?! `
`Why, why?! `
`Do you have any proof?! `
` `
`What the hell, don't just start butting in on someone else's family matters!! `
`I love Maria I have my own way of loving her so just keep your mouth shut!! `
`I didn't go on a vacation I was just working the whole time!!" `
`"I was trying to finish things up at work with all my strength, all my strength because I wanted to see Maria as soon as I could!! `
`I stayed at the company the whole whole whole whole, whole whole whole whole time!! `
`I don't know I don't know I don't know anything about Hokkaido don't just go ahead and say something like thaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!!! `
`Just get out!! `
`Get ooooooooout!! `
`What's wrong with yoooooouuu?!! `
`Get out!! `
`Get ooooooooouuuut!!!" `
`Rosa raged, her hair flying wildly. `
`A teacup was knocked over from the force of her standing up, `
`but far louder than that was the sound of her beating the table with both hands. `
`When faced with this rage that could accurately be described as wide-eyed derangement, `
`the district welfare officer couldn't help but be taken aback. `
`...And the same went for Maria, who was secretly watching this from the hallway. `
`She had already seen her mother in a rage several times before this. `
`But she had never seen her this crazed with anger. `
`When she saw this, Maria was sure. `
`...This was no longer her mother. `
`It was some other evil being that was possessing her mother's body... `
`And then, she herself was discovered by the evil being. `
`Maria knew that she was being reflected in the evil being's eyes. `
`Her mind went blank, and she felt as though her field of vision was racing off into the distance... `
`After fiercely closing in on Maria, Rosa mercilessly slapped her on her small shoulders... `
`and dropped her gaze towards the stuffed animal Maria was holding, Sakutaro. `
`"......Maria, `
`even though I told you so many times not to take that outside, `
`...you brought it with you, didn't you?" `
`‘...U-Uryu...... `
`I-It isn't Maria's fault... `
`I told her to take me...’ `
`"Th-That's not true...! `
`I brought Sakutaro on my own because I was lonely...! `
`So Mama, it isn't Sakutaro's fault...!!" `
`‘Uryu, ...Maria......’ `
`"It's not Sakutaro's fault!! `
`It's not Sakutaro's fault!!" `
`Instead of Maria, the brunt of Rosa's anger was aimed at the lion stuffed animal Maria was holding. `
`...A girl went shopping in the middle of the night, always clutching a lion stuffed animal. `
`Because of that, she had become well known in the shopping center... `
`"I, `
`......I, `
`Didn't I tell you not to take stuffed animals with yooooooooouuu?!!! `
`Why... `
`can't you... `
`listen to what Mama says?!! `
`Why?! `
`Why, why?! `
`Why can't you follow Mama's ruuuuuuules?!!" `
`With every single word, she stamped her heel and banged furiously on the wall. `
`...Of course, she didn't make direct contact with Maria. `
`However, the violence of the harsh sound certainly beat against her. `
`"M-Miss, ...stop that...!!" `
`"Let go!! `
`I said let go, damn iiiiiiiiiiiit!!" `
`The district welfare officer had come back to her senses and was pinning Rosa's arms behind her back. `
`But the instant Rosa was touched, she went wild, furiously throwing the welfare officer off. `
`...She hit the table and fell to the ground. `
`A teacup on the table smashed on the floor, making a violent sound... `
`‘...M-Maria didn't do anything wrong...! `
`It's my fault! `
`So don't scold Maria...!!’ `
`"I'm the one who brought Sakutaro...!! `
`It's not Sakutaro's fault!! `
`It's not Sakutaro's fault!! `
`So don't look at Sakutaro with those scary eyes!! `
`Don't look at hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiim!!" `
`‘Don't scold Maria...! `
`Don't scold Maria...!! `
`Uryuu--!!!’ `
`".........Y-You... `
`What were you doing just now, and a minute ago too? `
`Do you also play with dolls like that...outside? `
`Did you do it in front of the people in the store...? `
`"........................ `
`So that's why they remembered yoooooooou, `
`die you brainless moron!! Why are you such a dumbaaaaaaaaaaaassss?!!!" `
`"Answer me honestly. `
`When you went out, you always walked around with that stuffed animal without telling Mama, right?" `
`‘......U-Uryu......’ `
`"Stop using that weird stuffed animal talk!!! `
`Speak with your own words, not a stuffed animal's!!!" `
`"S-Sakutaro isn't a stuffed animal!! `
`He's my friend!! `
`Don't call him a stuffed animal... `
`Doooooooooooooooooooon't!!" `
`"Yeah, yeah, I get it, it was called Sakutarou, was it?! `
`You took him with you all the time when you went shopping, without telling Mama, right?" `
`"...Y-Yeah......" `
`Maria admitted it honestly. `
`If she hadn't admitted it, then Sakutaro would have said something to take the blame, `
`so by admitting it right away, she was protecting her small friend. `
`"Only Sakutarou? `
`Any others? `
`...You haven't been bringing weird things to school too, have you...?" `
`"...M-Miss!! `
`Surely your daughter has done nothing wrong! `
`Stop this interrogation at once!" `
`"You, stay quiet!!! `
`I'm talking with my daughter, aren't I?!!! `
`...Come on, Maria, look at Mama when you talk. `
`What's the answer to Mama's question?" `
`"...U-Uu-... `
`...It wasn't just Sakutaro. `
`...All the rabbits were with me too..." `
`"......Do you have them with you now...?" `
`"Uu-......" `
`Maria fished around in her pockets, `
`...pulling out four ceramic rabbits with her tiny hand... `
`The rabbits were her close friends, who could be together with her at school in Sakutaro's place. `
`But when Rosa saw that, she shook her head slightly as though dizzy... `
`On a {c:86EF9C:school notice}, it had been written that Maria was apparently bringing toys to school and playing with them, `
`and her family was instructed to try and prevent this. `
`But Rosa had rejected that, blaming the teacher and phoning in a protest of her own to the school. `
`...Saying that there was no way her child would bring toys to school. `
`For nearly an hour, she had shouted at the vice principal to stop making false accusations about her daughter. `
`...To a certain degree, those at the school had grasped that Maria was a pitiful girl. `
`They knew that the small toys she brought in were her only friends. `
`...So they had done their best to overlook it. `
`But when the other students caught sight of them, `
`some of the boys had started complaining that only she could bring toys, and the school had racked their brains on how to cope with this... `
`They had tried to gently send a warning by way of the mother, `
`but after Rosa's overreaction, even Maria's teacher decided to overlook it. `
`......But now Rosa knew. `
`She had been the one who was wrong, ...and her daughter really had been bringing toys to school. `
`......And those at the school... `
`had known that she was a disgrace who brought toys to school and played with them as though they were her only friends. `
`To Rosa, who thought her daughter was just a little different from normal children, `
`having this peculiar side of her daughter exposed and found fault with was, more than anything else, something she couldn't bear. `
`......So she howled. `
`She raged. `
`The district welfare officer tried to cut between Rosa and Maria again, `
`but she only met with Rosa's wrath once more. `
`Rosa once again threw the woman off with a face like a demon, `
`and when even that failed to curb her anger, she stomped on the ground over and over again so forcefully that it seemed she might break through the floor. `
`Then, after seeming to come back to her senses for a second, `
`......she immediately froze her harsh breathing...and asked Maria. `
`"......... `
`...Maria. `
`Those rabbits in the band, are they your close friends?" `
`"......U-Uu-......" `
`"I see. `
`Isn't it great that you have a full four friends?" `
`As she said that, Rosa grabbed one of the rabbits from Maria's hand. `
`Then, she shoved it in front of Maria's eyes so she could see it very well. `
`...The cute rabbit holding a trumpet was a small doll like a chess piece. `
`She slowly lifted it into the air. `
`...Of course, Maria's and Sakutaro's eyes also followed it... `
`And then, with a speed that the eye couldn't follow, she smashed it against the wall. `
`"Eek—!!!!" `
`‘......!!!’ `
`She had half imagined that this worst possible thing might happen. `
`So she instantly realized what had been done. `
`...So, Maria let out a short, despairing scream... `
`It was in pieces. `
`It had been small and sturdy, but that hadn't been enough to withstand her mother's fierce rage. `
`"......Because you didn't listen to what Mama told you, I broke one of them. `
`From now on, every time you disobey something Mama says, I'll break another one. `
`...Remember that!!!" `
`"Miss, ...you think to call yourself a mother after doing something like that?!! `
`You think you can do something like that and not hurt your daughter?!" `
`"Hurt Maria?! `
`I'm also hurting, right?! `
`Who's gonna take responsibility for my wounds?! `
`Weeeell?! `
`Who iiiiiiiiiis?!!! `
`Didn't I tell you to shut uuuuup!!!" `
`"S-Stop it, Mama...! `
`It's my fault...! `
`Don't get mad at this lady...!" `
`‘It isn't Maria's fault, ...it's mine...! `
`Don't get mad at Maria...! `
`Uryu, uryuuryuuryu, uryuu--!’ `
`"I, .........I told you to stop playing make‐believe with that stuffed animaaaaaaaal!! `
`In the first place, it's disturbing, a stuffed animal is your friend? Just how old are you this year?! `
`How old?! `
`Weeelll?!" `
`"This is just a gross, crappy stuffed animal made of cloth and cotton, right?!! `
`Is this the only kind of friend you have?! `
`If you have enough spare time to pretend this monstrous stuffed animal is your friend, go out and make some real human friends!!" `
`"Why can you never make any friends?!! `
`That's why your class always treats you like a weirdo and makes fun of you!! `
`Give it a rest and get ahold of yourself already!! `
`Grow up from this stuffed animal play!!" `
`‘Uryu, `
`...uryu......’ `
`"Like I said, stop playing with that stuffed animaaaaaaaaaall!!" `
`"Aaah!! `
`Mama, Mama!! `
`Give him back! `
`Give Sakutaro baaaaaaaaaaack!!" `
`‘Uryu-!! `
`Uryuu--! `
`Uryuuryu-!’ `
`Mama grabbed hold of Sakutaro's head...and took him from me... `
`Then, ......she smashed him against the wall, over and over. `
`‘Uryu-!! `
`It hurts, it hurts, hurts hurts hurts hurts...!!’ `
`"Fucking STOP!! `
`I told you to stop that stuffed animal aaaaaaaaaaact!! `
`It's because of this stuffed animal!! `
`That's why you can never make any friends! `
`That's why you alone are pushed off to the side in your class and treated like a freak!! `
`I should never have given you a stuffed animal like this!! `
`I should never have given you such a disgusting stuffed animal!!" `
`"Stop iiiiiiiiiiiiit!! `
`Give Sakutaro back, give Sakutaro back!! `
`Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!! `
`Sakutaro is my friend!! `
`My best friend!! `
`As long as Sakutaro's there, I don't need anything else! `
`So give him back!! `
`Give him baaaaaaaack!!" `
`...For some reason, my frantic request just added oil to the fire of Mama's anger... `
`Mama pushed my arm aside as I tried to grab Sakutaro and snatch him back, `
`and in a bizarre way, she stuck her fingernails on both hands deep into Sakutaro, twisting him... `
`The red muffler, which I had carefully wrapped for him every day, came off and fell to the floor... `
`...Sakutarou, who had been so, so precious to me... `
`...Was twisted, smashed, torn at with fingernails so much... `
`He was twisted in pain... `
`his face curving... `
`in sadness...... `
`Then Mama's fingernails... `
`found a stitch on the neck...... `
`and tore it... `
`...With the fingernails of both hands, `
`...she tore it apart...... `
`In that instant, `
`......Sakutaro's yellow cloth... `
`and the cotton inside...burst apart... `
`It looked almost like moist cotton candy... `
`‘......U‐...............ryu.....................’ `
`"...kutaro............?" `
`‘......Ma......ria.........’ `
`".........Sakutaro............" `
`‘U......ryu......{m:-5:―――}’ `
`"...............kutaro............" `
`‘{m:-5:―}―...... . . .   .         ’ `
`".........ta...ro........." `
`‘’ `
`... `
`......The crumpled yellow cloth and the cotton candy flowing out were thrust right in front of my eyes. `
`Then, ...through Mama's face, the evil being...stated it clearly. `
`"{i:Sakutarou is dead}." `
`mabapennedbisgeck. `
`gikuguki `
`......kutaro `
`......sakuta `
`...o `
`...ecknaped......... `
`......uuuuu. `
`uwaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuu`
`Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuuu... `
`gudaro... `
`sagudaro... `
`...Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuu...... `
`"{f:5:Maria}...... ......{f:5:Maria}......... `
`...Do not cry..." `
`"{f:5:Beatrice}, {f:5:Beatrice}...!! `
`Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!! `
`Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!" `
`"Sakutaro was a good friend... `
`As long as you do not forget that, he will always be with you... `
`So do not cry..." `
`"Bring him back to life!! `
`You can use a lot of magic, Beato!! `
`You can even bring Sakutaro back to life, right?!" `
`"......A-About that... `
`...Of course, if Sakutaro had been my furniture, it would be easy. `
`However, Sakutaro is your furniture. `
`...That makes it difficult for me." `
`"If you say it's difficult, that means it isn't impossible, right?! `
`Bring him back to life!! `
`Bring him back to life with the Endless Magiiiiiic!" `
`"......Hmm... `
`...To tell the truth... `
`Sakutarou's vessel was a stuffed animal Rosa made herself, correct...? `
`That Rosa has denied Sakutarou. `
`...A life that is not permitted by its own mother cannot exist..." `
`{f:5:Beatrice}'s words were feeble. `
`...Because she knew that, no matter what the excuse, `
`it wouldn't be enough to calm Maria and make her accept it. `
`But she had to communicate the painful truth to her disciple and close friend. `
`......She had to tell her the fact... `
`...that even with all of her own power, even she could not revive Sakutarou. `
`"As long as you continue to strongly believe in Sakutarou's existence, that soul will not disappear... `
`So, {f:5:Maria}, ...please, do not be sad..." `
`"Even now, look, ...believe that Sakutarou is smiling right over there..." `
`"No!!! `
`No `
`no `
`no!! `
`You have to bring Sakutaro back to life!! `
`No no no! `
`WaaA{0}AAa{0}a{0}a{0}aAAa{0}a{0}aAa{0}aAahhhh!!" `
`"Give it up...!! `
`There is no magic to revive Sakutarou...! `
`Despite that, you must strongly believe that Sakutarou will continue to exist as your close friend...!! `
`That power will become magic...!" `
`"That's not magic, that's not magic!! `
`You have to bring Sakutaro back to life...!! `
`You can't do it because Mama made him herself? `
`Why did Mama make Sakutaro? `
`It was to give him to me as a present, right? `
`It was to make him my friend, right? `
`So why...did Mama make it herself...and break it herself? `
`Why did Mama give birth to it by herself, and try to break it herself? `
`I don't understand, I don't understand!!" `
`"I hate Mama, hate Mama...!! `
`Can't stand it can't stand it too sad too sad...!! `
`Wanna smash Mama up like she did to Sakutaro...! `
`Wanna stick my fingernails in and tear her, turn her into cloth and cotton!! `
`Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!! `
`I can't stand it, I can't stand it, {f:5:Beatriiice}!! `
`Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, Sakutaroooooooo!!!!" `
`From the darkness behind Maria's back, two massive jet-black arms crept out, `
`twisting around Maria as she sobbed in anger. `
`Then, massive fingernails stuck into Maria's chest and stomach... `
`Maria could not see that. `
`...But Beato could. `
`Anger and sadness without any place to go will tear you apart. `
`...Beato knew that. `
`She could see that. `
`Yes. `
`...In the end, those massive arms were Maria's own. `
`Those fingernails slowly started to eat into her chest and stomach... `
`...With their immense size and strength, `
`those arms could probably tear Maria into bits easily... `
`But Maria herself couldn't notice. `
`Drowning in a sea of her own tears, ...she couldn't notice that her own arms were trying to tear apart her own chest... `
`"I can't stand it, can't stand it...!!! `
`If Sakutaro can't be brought back to life no matter what, ...I want revenge!! `
`Want to make Mama meet the same end!! `
`Want her to meet the same end as Sakutaro...! `
`{f:5:Beatrice}!! `
`Teach me magic for that!! `
`Teach me magic to beat Mama...!!" `
`"............ `
`...Is that truly how you feel?" `
`"Kill Mama!! `
`I'll kill her!! `
`No, that isn't Mama! `
`It's the bad witch possessing Mama! `
`I'll kill the witch Mama!! `
`Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!" `
`"......... `
`...Very well. `
`I shall give you that power. `
`...For tearing you and your beautiful heart apart, `
`...for giving you that pain, it is fitting that your heartless mother be torn apart considerably." `
`"......I shall teach it to you. `
`...I shall teach you of the abyss in the world of witches, of the depths where no light reaches..." `
`"Uuuuuuuu, Sakutaro, Sakutaro...!! `
`Hate, hate, I haaaate everyone!! `
`I hate Mama too, Ange too!! `
`I hate everyone, everyooone!! `
`Uuuuuuwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!" `
