`Scattered over the big bed were cute jellybeans of various colors, `
`and chocolate coins. `
`A fork was stuck into a shortcake peeking out of a gift box, `
`and there were decanters with drinks of various colors lined up on a side table. `
`But the color of the partially finished drink that had been poured into a cup was venomous, matching none of the decanters. `
`Someone had probably been playing around, mixing various things together. `
`That can be lots of fun, if you don't mind the taste. `
`On top of the fluffy bed were several colorful, big pillows like something from a dream. `
`And on this bed that looked like something out of a child's dream world, `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} lay face down, `
`and {f:5:Lambdadelta} lay face up, clutching a pillow and relaxing... `
`"Ahhahahhahhahha, it was pretty thrilling this time, wasn't it? `
`I got reeeally panicky when Beato said she'd stop the game." `
`".........What a rude witch, to start a game like this and try to end it by throwing it away." `
`"Wasn't Ange a good piece? `
`After Beato ran for it, Ange dragged her back and made her resume the game. `
`Although it's a shame that she gave Battler a little too much enthusiasm." `
`"......After all, I knew Battler was a softy." `
`"No kidding. `
`He looked like he might even go easy on Beato, his enemy." `
`"......I was uneasy that, like the last game, he might actually feel compassion for Beato and take the game in a weird direction. `
`......Ange was a trump card to get Battler back on track when he mistook his goal. `
`......Although I wanted her to support him a bit more before using her up. `
`She really did get used right off the bat. `
`What a waste for a piece that required so much preparation." `
`"Hehheheheh! `
`Good thing I shackled her with that rule about not giving her name! `
`If that hadn't been set up, the brother-sister tag team would've swallowed Beato up and won in the blink of an eye." `
`"......I thought it'd be a chance for them to press her all at once, `
`but your mark was so restrictive that I couldn't make the best use of her. `
`...Aaah, what a waste that piece was." `
`"Isn't it obvious that such an unfair piece would have to be retired right away? `
`Well, in the end, she did a good job of preventing the suspension of the game, and that helps me out too. `
`The way she made both our interests match is what made her a truly wonderful piece." `
`"......She was an innocent kid like Battler, so it was easy to get her to do as I said. `
`......Morons and impulsive types make the best pieces. `
`...Aaah, I really can't stand losing that piece." `
`"By now, that kid's minced meat! `
`Hey, let's make hamburgers out of her later on{p:0:☆} `
`Oh wait, didn't you like gyoza more? `
`I wonder what little sister tastes like, *giggle*, hilarious!" `
`".........Is it really okay for you to be so relaxed? `
`Thanks to Ange, Battler has gotten all fired up. `
`I'm pretty sure he's started a hot pursuit of Beato, making this game take a big turn in my favor, right...? `
`I mean, didn't Battler just solve almost all the mysteries up until now?" `
`"Huuh? `
`Nooot even close! `
`Almost all of Battler's blue truth was wrong! `
`Beato's lukewarm red is full of holes. `
`If she had any brains in her, she'd slip through it easily by setting up a suitable web of twisted logic. `
`...Yeah, it really ticks me off. `
`If it were me, I'd thoroughly cut down all of it with the red." `
`"......Oh, really? `
`And I was sure that those were all correct. `
`...Well, I don't know about that small bomb part though." `
`"Not all of Battler's blue truths were valid. `
`...When talking about the first game, Beato clearly declared that she `
`{p:1:guarantees the identities of all unidentified corpses}! `
`This defeats Battler's theory about the culprit of the Eva/Hideyoshi closed room murder being someone who faked up a corpse." `
`"Next, Kanon might've died in an accident in the boiler room, but...*giggle*! `
`What kind of accident could drive a stake into his chest? `
`Are you a moron? `
`I'll slice it with that red treasured sword thing." `
`"{p:1:Kanon did not die in an accident}! `
`For the next one, the murders of the three including Genji in the parlor, the thought that it was a simultaneous murder where they shot each other in a clockwise pattern at the same time is laughable. `
`{p:1:Genji, Kumasawa, and Nanjo were not killers}!" `
`"The final trap X to kill Natsuhi was also ridiculous. `
`{p:1:The thing that shot Natsuhi wasn't a trap, it was a real shooting murder with a gun raised and trigger pulled}! `
`*giggle* Sucks for you...!" `
`"...You shouldn't do that. `
`Saying something like that in red. `
`That kid's trying to say that she bounced Natsuhi's bullet back with magic and killed her." `
`"Ohohohoh, oh my, how terrible of me, you're right...! `
`Even the blue truth for the second game was way too naive. `
`" `
`{p:1:When the six were murdered in the chapel, the culprit was inside the chapel}! `
`That guy keeps trying to explain things using trap X. `
`What the heck is trap X, some weird mystery novel cliche?" `
`"It's also laughable to say that, in the case where Nanjo and Kumasawa were killed in the servant room, someone else inherited Kanon's name. `
`{p:1:The only one who can go by the name of Kanon is the person himself}! `
`{p:1:No other human can adopt that name}!" `
`"And that theory about borrowing the master key from Rosa for Natsuhi's room is also worthless! `
`"{p:1:After the master keys came into Rosa's control, never did any of them leave her hands}! `
`{p:1:Except for the time when she lent one to Battler to unlock Natsuhi's room}. `
`I can keep on going, but just taking a quick look at them turns out like this, get it?" `
`"......Forget taking a quick look, ...you've just denied Battler's blue truth for the first and second games across the board. `
`......My, my, what a shame. `
`If Battler heard, he'd faint." `
`"...Right? `
`Beato wasn't cornered at all. `
`......Looks like that kid's a pretty good actress after all. `
`I'm sure she planned to make it look like she was getting cornered this game, `
`and then sometime next game, *bang*, she'll slice it up with a single red stroke to make Battler freak." `
`"*giggle* And then I'm sure she'll say it again with a huge smile. `
`"Witches neeever get into a pinch"! `
`Pff, *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!" `
`"......Then that whole tragic atmosphere as though Beato was getting cornered was all an act?" `
`"Isn't it obvious?! `
`She really is a great actress! `
`Even though she wasn't cornered at all, it felt like an astonishing, last-episode climax! `
`She's totally the winner for best supporting actress this year!! `
`Oh, but of course I'm the star! `
`You'd do fine too, Beeern!" `
`"......At the end, she said something like "Kill me" and laid out a big riddle. `
`Wasn't that her last stand, with Beato to be finished for good if that riddle was solved?" `
`"*giggle*giggle*...! `
`Come on, were you seriously tricked too, Bern? `
`That wasn't even close to a last stand! `
`Beato's still holding back a killer hidden move. `
`...When she stuck out both hands to give the final riddle, did you notice how she lowered just her right hand?" `
`"...Yeah, now that you mention it. `
`......Is that what that meant?" `
`"Sure is! `
`That kid still had plenty of hidden moves left! `
`And none of the mysteries have been solved...! `
`That tension, like she'd been exposed and the next episode would be the last... `
`She truly is a genius at acting. `
`Yeah, I wanna see her knock Battler down to the very bottom right away!" `
`"That kid's been totally encouraged by her "North Wind and the Sun Strategy" from last time, right? `
`I'm sure Battler will sympathize with Beato again and fall for it completely...! `
`After all, a single tear from a woman can fool a man, totally economical and profitable!!" `
`"......I wonder if Battler will get caught by the same move again. `
`I've got to spur him on so he never feels sympathy again. `
`...Although Ange's mincemeat seems to have done that pretty well." `
`"A power-up from an Ange-flavored hamburger? `
`Ohhohohohohohoho! `
`Of course, I won't lose either. `
`Starting here, I'll thoroughly support Beato to rally her up enough to compete with Battler. `
`...Beato won't lose. `
`I mean, I'm threatening her with a wonderful punishment game if she loses{p:0:♪}" `
`"......Your punishment games are seriously not cool, so you should go a little easy on her." `
`"I've decided what to do for your next punishment game, Bern. `
`Wanna hear? Wanna hear?" `
`"No." `
`"Come ooon, ask me{p:0:☆} `
`Guess what, guess what? `
`I'll lock you in a wonderful, wonderful castle. `
`That castle will be surrounded by pure white castle walls, 12 kilometers to a side. `
`With a height of 10 meters. `
`Magic and tricks are prohibited! `
`You really couldn't jump over that, right?" `
`"1,440,000,000 cubic meters? `
`......You can stop there, I already know what you're going to say." `
`"Eheheheheh! `
`And that place will start getting buried with gems, one every day! `
`I'll lock you in it until the castle walls are packed with them, and you've been buried to death with gems. `
`Isn't that a wonderful, romantic punishment game?" `
`".........If you multiply the length of the walls by five and make it one tenth its current height, I wouldn't mind if you shut me in it right now." `
`"Really?! `
`That would make it 3,600,000,000 cubic meters, right?! `
`The time period for the punishment game would more than double, right?! `
`Aaahh, you'll be my prisoner for such a long time?! `
`I love you Bern, I really love yo~u{p:0:♪}" `
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} playfully approached {f:5:Bernkastel}, who yawned, looking bored, as she touched the bottom of {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s chin as though cuddling a cat... `
`"You're betting on Battler's victory. `
`And I'm betting on an eternal tie for the two of them. `
`......Doesn't that mean no one's betting on Beato's victory?" `
`".........I wouldn't. `
`Her chances of winning are zero." `
`"Ohohoh! `
`How truly pitiful, being told by the Witch of Miracles that there's no chance of a miracle! `
`Although I wouldn't bet on her either, right? `
`I can say that with certainty!" `
`"......It's also pretty sad when the Witch of Certainty says that you're certainly screwed." `
`Unusually for them, they giggled together... `
`"I wonder how this game will resolve itself..." `
`"......Yeah, that's the one thing we can't predict. `
`...That's why it's fun." `
`"I won't permit escaping or suspensions any longer. `
`I'll certainly make them continue their game, and I won't let them run away...! `
`Even though I can't even imagine what will happen next, `
`I know it certainly won't end that way." `
`".........At the very least, it won't end with Beato's victory." `
`"I mean, think about it. `
`Neither of us `
`is betting on Beato's victory! `
`In other words, if it looks like Beato is gonna win, she'll have us two Great Witches as enemies...!" `
`"......Exactly. `
`Our powers are most in equilibrium when balancing between a tie and Battler's advantage. `
`If it tips too much in Beato's favor, both of us will line up along the same vector and drag Beato back." `
`"In other words, the instant Beato's in a superior position, ...she'll have to deal with both of us as enemies. `
`......Ehheheheheh! `
`A common front with Bern, sounds fuuun{p:0:♪}" `
`"......Thanks. `
`...But I'm not going into a konpeitou candy bath with you." `
`"Aaaw, and I was gonna cover you with melted marshmallows `
`while taking a konpeitou shower." `
`"......How pitiful. `
`That child is a living toy, a doll you caught so that you could play with me, Lambda." `
`"I'm good at playing with dolls. `
`...I really can do it well, okay? `
`I'm proud of being able to play with a single toy for hundreds of years without getting tired of it." `
`"......You're her ally at some times and oppose her at others, `
`toying with her for all eternity. `
`...How pitiful. That kid is now our doll." `
`"Hehheheh, that's right, that kid is our doll. `
`No end has been prepared for that kid except the ones the two of us desire. `
`In other words, I can say for sure that this can only end by repeating a tie for eternity because of me, `
`or else with Beato losing and being destroyed because of you, Bern. `
`......Heheh, ...as far as this game ending with Beato's victory goes..." `
`"......I will proclaim it as the Witch of Miracles." `
`"Then I will proclaim it as the Witch of Certainty." `
`""Beato certainly cannot win. `
`And a miracle certainly will not occur."" `
`""Ahhahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!"" `
