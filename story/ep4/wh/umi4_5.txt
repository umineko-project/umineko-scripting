`Forcefully opening the door with a clunk, Rosa flew in with Maria. `
`"Is Genji-san or anyone there...?! `
`It doesn't matter who, bring us a bath towel...!!" `
`There was already a full-blown typhoon outside, and it was starting to pour down hard. `
`Even though she'd had an umbrella, Maria had been in the rose garden amid all that wind and rain the whole time. `
`She had grown ice cold. `
`Maria had gotten into a minor fight with Rosa in the rose garden and had been told to stay there. `
`...She had done as she was told and had continued to wait in that spot, even though rain was pouring down. `
`Rosa certainly had gotten a little emotional and angry, `
`but Maria's stubborn whim was probably more to blame. `
`...The cousins, who had seen that exchange, `
`were relieved to see that mother and child were close to each other again. `
`Rosa scrubbed Maria's head with a towel. `
`She seemed overcome with worry that Maria had caught a cold, but Maria herself was nonchalant. `
`"Are you okay? `
`You didn't catch a cold, did you? `
`Maybe we really should go back for now and get a change of clothes..." `
`"Uu-, I'm just fine! `
`More importantly, I'm hungry, so food's better than changing clothes, uu-!" `
`"Hahahaha. `
`She looks okay, Aunt Rosa. `
`She's gotta be if she's this spirited." `
`"It's a really good thing she had an umbrella. `
`...I was thinking she might be soaked to the bone. `
`The fact that she had an umbrella certainly is a silver lining." `
`"But Maria! `
`Even if you have an umbrella, you've gotta get to shelter when it starts raining so hard, okay? `
`Little girls definitely shouldn't let their bodies get cold." `
`"......Uu-." `
`"It's okay, Jessica-chan. `
`...It's Mama's fault for telling her to stay there. `
`I'm really sorry, I'm really sorry...!!" `
`"Uu-! `
`I'm a good girl? `
`I'm a good girl for doing what Mama said? `
`I stayed there even though it was cold, stayed there until Mama came! `
`Uu-uu-!" `
`"Yes, you really are a good girl, Maria. `
`You did exactly what Mama said... `
`Very well done. `
`But next time, even if Mama tells you to do something, find some shelter if it starts raining like that. `
`Okay...? `
`Promise Mama." `
`"Uu-. `
`Promise Mama. `
`...Uu-{p:0:☆}" `
`As Rosa gently held Maria, they joined their pinkies together and promised. `
`Battler and the others realized that by touching her mother's pinky, `
`the warmth had started to return to Maria's body. `
`"Kanon-kun, thanks for the towel. `
`That really helped." `
`"...Then, if you would excuse me." `
`As Kanon bowed with a blank expression, as though he'd done nothing that required gratitude, he left the parlor. `
`"...Okay, it's already dinnertime. `
`Let's all go together. `
`...I'll even give Maria my dessert for being so good." `
`"Uu-! `
`Really Mama?! `
`Uu-uu-, get dessert, uu-uu-uu-{p:0:♪} `
`Love Mama, love Mama!" `
`"Hey, Maria, don't jump around. `
`Mama loves you too, Maria. `
`Love Maria, love Maria." `
`"I love Mama too, love Mama! `
`Uu-uu-uu-uu-!" `
`"Uu-uu-uu-uu-{p:0:♪}" `
`Rosa and Maria looked really close. `
`Even the cousins who watched started to feel a long-forgotten warmth fill up their chests. `
`"...You know, that might be the age when you're on your best terms with your parents." `
`"It wasn't like that for me. `
`Mom was always yelling at me to study, study, study." `
`"That's because they love their children. `
`A parent's love isn't always gentle and indulgent. `
`My mother was strict with me too, but now I realize that it was because she treasured me so." `
`"Uu-uu-uu-! `
`Love Mama, love Mama!" `
`"Love Maria, love Maria{p:0:♪} So, shall we get some food? `
`Let's be friends and hold hands." `
`"Uu-! `
`Be friends and hold hands! `
`Mama and me, friends, friends{p:0:♪}" `
`"Yes, that's right. `
`Mama and Maria are friends. `
`We'll aaalways be like this. `
`I love you, Maria..." `
`"......What's going on, all of a sudden? `
`...What's up?" `
`The sudden sound had come from the teacup Gretel had been holding, which had fallen and smashed. `
`"......Sorry. `
`I got careless. `
`Sorry for dropping it." `
`The cup on the floor had smashed to pieces. `
`...Would it really have made such a sound and smashed to pieces just by being dropped from that height? `
`Even someone as thick-headed as Battler could realize that she was in a bad mood over something, `
`but he couldn't understand why she had suddenly grown so displeased. `
`When she made to bend over and pick up the fragments of the cup, Ronove appeared out of nowhere and stopped her. `
`"You will injure yourself. `
`Leave the cleaning up to me. `
`Shall I bring you another cup of black tea...?" `
`"...I don't need it. `
`......I guess a demon's black tea just doesn't match my tastes." `
`"Hoh. `
`To think there's someone whose tastes aren't satisfied even by Ronove's tea. `
`I must respect your discerning palate." `
`"......I'm getting bored, so I'll go out for a second." `
`"Bored? `
`Wait a sec, this is where things start to get interesting. `
`About now, Maria is probably going to say that she got an umbrella and a letter from {f:5:Beatrice} again, right? `
`This is the essential part..." `
`"Excuse me. `
`Sorry, I'm counting on you to clean this up." `
`"Leave it to me." `
`Without saying anything else, Gretel disappeared of her own accord. `
`Her form literally melted and disappeared into thin air... `
`There was definitely a displeased expression on her face. `
`But neither Battler nor Ronove, and of course, not Beato either, could understand why her mood had so suddenly worsened. `
`All that remained was the scent of the black tea she'd spilled... `
`......I don't like it. `
`No, to be more blunt, it disgusts me. `
`"Uu-...? `
`...Why are you so irritated, Ange...?" `
`"Why, you say?! `
`Isn't it obvious...?" `
`"Uu-. `
`...I don't understand..." `
`Even Maria onee-chan, with that blank expression on her face, ...irritated me. `
`As I held my hands palms up in the empty air, from out of nowhere, a single book landed on them. `
`......It was Maria onee-chan's diary. `
`Even though I didn't turn the pages, the pages were flipped through, despite there being no wind, `
`and the door to Maria onee-chan's world opened. `
`"...Why do you think I'm not happy, Ange?" `
`"......Think about it objectively." `
`"By objectively, you mean from your viewpoint, right?" `
`"......... `
`...Are you trying to say that the truth is different for me and you, Maria onee-chan?" `
`"Truth can change its form depending on the observer. `
`And observers from the future always overwrite that form. `
`......Ange, what are you trying to do to my happiness...?" `
`"............" `
`The pages of the diary were flipped through at greater and greater speeds... `
`Then, a brilliant light poured out from the depths of the diary, ...swallowing everything up and painting over everything with white. `
`"......Sorry, Maria. `
`Mama has to take care of some urgent business that's piled up, so I need to stay holed up at the company for a while. `
`...I probably won't be able to come back home until late at night the day after tomorrow." `
`"...Uu-. `
`...Then, what about your promise to go to the movies with me on Sunday...?" `
`"The movies...? `
`Umm-" `
`Judging by Rosa's tone, she had clearly forgotten that promise. `
`But Maria's response to that was an apology for asking... `
`......I'm sorry. `
`Maria apologized for troubling her mother by asking that question... `
`"......I'll stay home. `
`I'll definitely wait patiently. `
`...I'll take a bath every day and change my underwear. `
`...And I know where the money is. `
`......I'll go to a different store every day. `
`I'll try not to go out too late. `
`If a policeman asks, I'll say I'm running errands for Mama. `
`...I'll do what Mama says, like Mama says." `
`"............ `
`...That's right. `
`You really are being a good girl. `
`If you do that, I'll buy you a present. `
`Okay? `
`Go to bed by 9:00. `
`You mustn't tell the teacher or any adults that Mama isn't coming home. `
`Okay...?" `
`".........Yes. `
`...So Mama, do your best at work. `
`...Do your best, finish your work, ...and come back as soon as you can... `
`I...won't cry all night and annoy the neighbors anymore... `
`...So come back quickly......" `
`"...... `
`...Well then, I'm busy, so I'll hang up. `
`...Be a good girl and wait. `
`Don't do anything you shouldn't. `
`Goodbye." `
`*click*. `
`...With a tone of finality in her voice, Rosa hung up the phone without waiting for Maria's answer. `
`Maria politely set down the receiver and returned to the sofa. `
`There sat the stuffed animal Sakutaro, with whom she'd been watching TV until a second ago. `
`Sakutaro was holding the remote control to the TV. `
`...The TV had been turned off because of the phone call. `
`He looked like he was telling her to push the switch because he wanted to watch TV again quickly. `
`"......Sakutaro, `
`...wanna watch...TV?" `
`‘...Uryu? `
`You don't want to watch anymore, Maria...? `
`If the actors' team gets all the questions right, they can still make a huge comeback. `
`Uryu-!’ `
`"......No. `
`......That's enough...TV." `
`Again, ...Mama was busy with her work and didn't come home. `
`Mama works so much overtime that she doesn't come home until late. `
`...Because she has "dates" or something, she always comes home after drinking a lot of alcohol, even though she's not good at drinking, `
`and with a pale face, she'll go straight into the shower and then to bed. `
`And because she has overtime even on the weekends or something, she says she has to spend the night there, and almost never comes home. `
`...Recently, she started saying something about how she's got a big job she's working on, so this sort of thing happens a lot... `
`...The pictures I did my best on during drawing time were laughed at by everyone, `
`but even so, I wanted to show them just to Mama, ...and once again, she won't be able to look at them for me. `
`And I could talk about the time everyone pushed the job of cleaning up onto me, but I did my best by myself and was praised by the teacher. `
`Or the time I went shopping, and the man at the shop said I'm always such a good kid and gave me a free canned coffee. `
`Then there was the time I wanted to encourage Mama because she worked so hard on her job... `
`and hid a card for her under her pillow. `
`"......And there's a lot...of other things...I wanted to talk about." `
`‘......Mama's working really hard at her job. `
`She's working with all of her strength so that we can eat every day.’ `
`"...I hate her job. `
`...If only she'd just quit." `
`‘A job is an important thing for adults to do. `
`...It lets Maria eat, `
`buys clothes, `
`pays for school lunches, `
`and pays the deposit for summer camp. `
`...All that happens because Mama works and earns money.’ `
`"......... `
`...I don't need food. `
`Don't need clothes. `
`Don't need school lunches and don't want to go to summer camp. `
`...It's not like any of the groups will let me join in." `
`‘Uryu... `
`...Just now, on the phone, Mama promised that she'd buy a present when she comes back from work, right? `
`I think she made that promise because you're important to her, Maria, `
`and she'd feel bad if she made you lonely.’ `
`"...You think so?" `
`‘Uryu! `
`It definitely isn't a pain for her, or annoying, or anything! `
`...Mama also wants to be by your side all the time, Maria. `
`...It's also painful and sad for her, since she can't do that. `
`......I remember when she spent the whole night by your side, crying.’ `
`"......Yeah. `
`...I didn't understand why she was crying, ...but she was so sad, `
`...and I couldn't do anything but stay silent by her side." `
`‘I remember the last thing Mama said then. `
`...She said "Thank you, Maria". `
`......She said that just by being by her side, you were her only ally in the world. `
`...Uryu, do you remember?’ `
`"Yeah... `
`......I'm her only ally in the world, `
`...she said." `
`Sakutaro set the remote control on the table, crawled up onto the sofa, `
`sat on my lap, ...and spoke to me, gazing into my eyes. `
`‘...I'm sure Mama feels the same way you do, Maria. `
`......The designs Mama draws are the only ones laughed at by her clients. `
`...Only Mama's company has troublesome jobs pushed onto it by other companies. `
`Mama is the president, so she has to take care of everything by herself. `
`...Only Mama's company never gets included in the business of other companies. `
`......Mama's only ally is Maria. `
`...If you tell her to stop doing her job, ...where in the world could she find an ally......?’ `
`"......Nnng, `
`......Sakutaro..." `
`‘The only person I have in the whole world is Maria. `
`...The only person Mama has in the whole world is Maria. `
`......What about you, Maria?’ `
`"...I've got Mama, and I've got you too, Sakutaro..." `
`‘So, Maria, you aren't lonely at all! `
`Uryu!’ `
`"......Uu-." `
`‘Since Mama's busy with her work, she can't be together with you very often, but please, don't blame her for that, Maria. `
`...In exchange, I'll always be here, will be by your side forever.......So don't cry, okay...? `
`......Uryu... `
`Can't your sadness be stopped......if I'm with you...?’ `
`"......Uuu, ...uuuuuuuuuuu, Sakutaro... `
`...Uuuuuuuuu!! `
`Uwaaaaaaaahhh, waaaaaaaaaaaahhh..." `
`......From the corner of Maria's heart, which she had been doing her best to seal up, ...drops of sadness finally dripped down. `
`...*drip*drip*. `
`*drop*drop*. `
`...*drip*drop*drip*drop*. `
`...Even though weekends when Mama didn't come home weren't that rare a thing. `
`...It wasn't as though that night was particularly painful or sad compared to other nights. `
`...And yet, Maria's tears poured down. `
`‘Uryu-...! `
`Maria, don't cry... `
`I'll always be with you... `
`Even if you cry, Maria, I won't. `
`I'm a lion cub, so I won't cry even if I'm lonely. `
`...Even though I want to cry too, I won't...!’ `
`"Why won't you cry, Sakutaro...? `
`Even though you're so sad that you can't hold back the tears, you won't cry...?" `
`‘Uryu. `
`But if I cry, who will make you feel better...? `
`So I won't. `
`After all, I want to get your spirits up.’ `
`"If I get my spirits up, ...will Mama come back...?" `
`‘When Mama comes back, if she's welcomed by a happy Maria, ...I'm sure she'll be happy. `
`Uryu.’ `
`"...Mama...will be happy...?" `
`‘Uryu. `
`If you do that, then I'm sure her fatigue from work will also be healed. `
`Then, I'm sure she'll start feeling better sooner and will play with you a lot.’ `
`"............" `
`‘When you come home and Mama's waiting for you there, and she's in the kitchen in high spirits, don't you feel really happy? `
`I'm sure Mama feels the same way.’ `
`"...So if I watch over the house in high spirits, ...Mama will be happy too?" `
`‘Uryu!’ `
`Sakutaro nodded deeply with his big head. `
`The tears couldn't keep falling from Maria's eyes. `
`...If she greeted Mama with a tear-stained face, Mama would probably get sad too. `
`‘You know about it, Maria. `
`You can't use the magic that creates smiles if you aren't smiling too.’ `
`"...Yeah. `
`...I know. `
`So, I won't cry anymore." `
`‘Hey, Maria. `
`I have an idea for how to have a fun time. `
`...Uryu, wanna hear it?’ `
`"...What?" `
`‘Mama won't come back until late night Sunday. `
`So let's have a pajama party and keep it a secret from Mama.’ `
`"A pajama party...?" `
`‘Until you get tired late tonight, eat candy and drink soda in bed, and play with me.’ `
`"A pajama party. `
`...Yeah, sounds fun. `
`...I don't have to go to bed at 9:00, right? `
`Mama won't get mad if I don't sleep?" `
`‘This is a secret between me and you, only for when Mama isn't around. `
`So tonight, until you get sleepy, let's have fun the whole time. `
`Let's eat jellybeans and try to guess what color we'll get next. `
`Let's split open peanuts and try to guess which half is the {c:86EF9C:Grandpa}. `
`Let's search for treasure in the closet. `
`And more, and more! `
`I wonder what it'll taste like if we mix cola and melon soda.’ `
`"Uu-. `
`I wanted to try it once, but asked Mama if it was okay and she got mad." `
`‘Uryu-! `
`Let's keep it a secret from Mama and try it out{p:0:♪} `
`Tonight, let's play a lot, laugh a lot, and blow away our tears with happiness. `
`Don't worry, it'll definitely be fun if I'm here! `
`I'll definitely make you happy, Maria.’ `
`"Yeah, yeah! `
`It'll definitely be fun if Sakutaro's there. `
`I'll definitely be happy. `
`Thank you, Sakutaro. `
`I won't cry anymore. `
`Let's play all we can, get happy all we can, and say welcome back when Mama gets home." `
`‘Uryu-! `
`Tonight, let's play a lot and feel a lot better{p:0:♪} `
`Let's have the kind of secret party we can only have when Mama isn't here. `
`If we're noisy enough, I'm sure plenty of friends will come to play from the land of the looking glass and wonderland. `
`Then, we'll have so many friends that we won't be able to get bored. `
`Uryu-!’ `
`"Uryu-!!" `
`...Then, Maria began her pajama party all alone with Sakutaro, having fun until late into the night. `
`She played by sticking her hand into the bag of jellybeans without looking, trying to guess which color she'd pull out next. `
`...Sakutaro had good intuition and got it right a lot. `
`Maria also had a brilliant streak where she guessed right four times in a row. `
`The game where she split peanuts open and tried to guess which was the Grandpa... `
`was easier than guessing the color of the jellybeans, so she got it right a lot. `
`Sucking her salt-covered fingers was impolite, but that was the yummiest part. `
`She liked both cola and melon soda on their own. `
`She hoped that by mixing her two favorite drinks, there might be a flash of light like alchemy, `
`and a new drink that no one had ever tasted before would be created. `
`She got excited about how, if it turned out really delicious, she'd call it Sakutaro Soda and sell it. `
`But, unexpectedly, it had a weird taste that she hadn't hoped for. `
`And the color was somewhat dull and thick. `
`...Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised that black and green mixed together would make this. `
`...Too bad. I imagined that it'd become a sparkling pineapple color. `
`But, it was an awesome, incredible, fun night. `
`If it's this fun here, maybe Mama will feel like coming home and drop by out of the blue. `
`...So, I got the feeling that Mama might suddenly come home and went to the front door many times to check, `
`but there was no way Mama would be able to come home when she was this busy with work. `
`But rather than a feeling of loneliness, `
`it felt just a little disappointing that Mama couldn't join in on this fun late-night party. `
`Sometime soon, I'll do this when Mama is around and let her join in. `
`Mama likes some things I don't think are yummy, `
`so maybe she'll really like Sakutaro Soda. `
`When Mama comes back tired, I'll serve her some. `
`And more than anything. `
`...I want to at least write about this fun night in a letter and tell Mama about it. `
`So that these feelings of happiness will reach Mama too. `
`Her work is always so tough and she comes home so tired, so I hope I can share this happiness with her. `
`Mama will almost certainly come home tired late Sunday night, `
`and I hope I can brighten her day even just a little by sharing this happiness... `
`I gently placed that letter on Mama's desk. `
`{e:070:To Mama. `
`{n}Good job with your work again today{p:0:☆} Let me share my happiness with you. `
`{n}{m:-5:―}―From Maria} `
`Then, I decided to give a present to Sakutaro for proposing this wonderful party. `
`It was a small, red muffler I found when searching for treasure in the closet. `
`When I was still very young, Mama knitted this tiny thing. `
`"Maria" was embroidered on it with knitting wool. `
`...I softly wrapped that muffler around Sakutaro. `
`It really suited him, accenting his yellow with red very well. `
`‘......Uryu. `
`...Does it look good on me...?’ `
`Sakutaro looked embarrassed as he wore his first present ever. `
`...Yeah. `
`It really looks good on him. `
`"Uu-. `
`Sakutaro, thank you so much for everything. `
`It was so fun tonight. `
`I can't even remember why I was crying. `
`...Let's be together from now on. `
`And let's always play and laugh together." `
`‘Uryu-! `
`Love you, Maria!’ `
`"Me too. `
`Love you, Sakutaro." `
`After playing so wildly, Maria's room was a mess. `
`Maybe she played a little too much. `
`...But I'm tired for today, so let's sleep together. `
`And tomorrow, we'll clean up together and welcome Mama with a clean room. `
`...All right, Sakutaro? `
`Uryu-{p:0:♪} `
`"...See? `
`I am...no, we are so happy, right?" `
`"...... `
`Is this your happiness, Maria onee-chan...?" `
`"Yeah. `
`I'm happy." `
`"...Even though you were looking forward to that movie so much, and Aunt Rosa promised that she'd definitely take you, she completely forgot." `
`"She just happened to forget because she was so busy with work. `
`...Even if she remembered, with her work, there'd be nothing she could do. `
`Whether she remembered or not, Mama would've spent the night at work. `
`She couldn't go to the movies. `
`......Whether she remembered or not is a minor issue." `
`...There's no way that's a minor issue. `
`After all, ...when Aunt Rosa answered "Movie?" on the phone, `
`it was obvious that she'd completely forgotten her promise. `
`And when she heard that, Maria onee-chan's mood definitely darkened. `
`"Well, ...like you say, `
`even if Aunt Rosa had remembered her promise, you wouldn't have been able to go to the movies in the end. `
`...But even so. `
`...To think that your mother just forgot her promise to spend one of her few days off with you, ...it's sad. `
`I'd be mad." `
`"............ `
`...Yeah. `
`It was sad. `
`Because even if she had remembered, we wouldn't have been able to go to the movies. `
`...But after that, I had a very, very fun night with Sakutaro. `
`You must've thought that pajama party looked really fun too, Ange." `
`"......... `
`There's no way that would be fun. `
`...I mean, all that messing around you did that night... `
`was just intentionally making a big fuss about nothing, all so you could forget that you were lonely and that your mother wasn't coming home." `
`"That's not true. `
`I really did have a fun party with Sakutaro." `
`"No, that's wrong! `
`You were just so sad, and you hated your mother so much for forgetting her promise, that you made a mess of your room...!!" `
`"......Where was something like that ever written in my diary?" `
`"It isn't written anywhere! `
`But...by reading in the gaps between every line, I can understand your feelings! `
`You didn't have a good time at all that evening! `
`And you stayed up late when you were told not to, broke the strict rule about eating sweets outside of snack time, `
`...and when even that didn't bury your sadness, you went wild in your room......and made a mess of it, right...?!! `
`And after you made a mess of your room and were all tired out, `
`......all you did was claw at the bed sheets and cry yourself to sleep, right...?!" `
`"......The diary does say that Mama probably forgot her promise about the movie... `
`and that I stayed up late having a pajama party with Sakutaro...and made a mess of my room searching for treasure." `
`"Yes. `
`And......this is what it means! `
`You were starving for Aunt Rosa's love, Maria onee-chan...! `
`And Aunt Rosa always put her work and her public image first, always keeping you on the back-burner...!" `
`"That's what disgusts me! `
`Because I know just how superficial Aunt Rosa's words of love for you were!! `
`You should realize this yourself!" `
`"So, ...how can you say you're happy despite that?! `
`I don't understand...that part of you, Maria onee-chan!! `
`Even at my age, I can't understand it at all...!! `
`Why aren't you sad? `
`Why is it that you can experience a reality filled with misfortune and can call yourself happy?! `
`I can't do it, I can't understand it...!!" `
`"......You're a sad kid, Ange." `
`"I don't get it!! `
`Why are you pitying me?!" `
`"......Even though a "fact" about a really fun pajama party is written about in my diary, `
`......if the same "fact" is observed by different people, it has a different form." `
`I remembered talking about something like this with {f:5:Bernkastel}. `
`Truth is unfixed and changes its form every time it's witnessed. `
`By the way it's perceived...in other words, depending on the person who perceives it, a single truth becomes different truths. `
`And truths of the past are painted over by truths of the future... `
`"In this diary, I wrote that what happened that night was very, very fun." `
`"...You described the events of that night as something very happy." `
`"And yet, when you read the diary, the events of that night sound very, very sad." `
`"...Even though you describe it as a happy scene, I read between the lines and realized that that wasn't true." `
`"Stop it." `
`"............" `
`"This...tells of a happy night. `
`......This is...the "truth" of that night. `
`Please, don't take this happy truth... `
`...and paint over it with a new, different truth." `
`"......Are you...happy with this, Maria onee-chan?" `
`"Yes. `
`I'm happy. `
`......That's why I feel sad for you, since you wouldn't be able to feel happiness in a similar situation." `
`......Right now, I'm like she was then...Just as isolated, with no friends. `
`Ange...had accepted her isolated reality for what it was. `
`But Maria...painted over her isolated reality with a reality of happiness. `
`Ushiromiya Maria took a sad truth... `
`and changed it into happiness. `
`That was... `
`the only, and yet very large, ...difference between me and Maria onee-chan. `
`And, even though I'm unable to accept it, `
`...I'm also jealous of that power. `
`"Yes. `
`...That's right. `
`This is "power". `
`...I was able to find happiness with that power. `
`Because you don't have that power, you can't find happiness, Ange." `
`"What......is... `
`...that power......?" `
`"I didn't know what to call that power either. `
`...Not at this point in time, at least. `
`...Eventually, I was taught its true form. `
`...I'll talk about it later. `
`On the next page. `
`......So then, so then, late Sunday night, `
`Mama came back with a present, just like she'd promised..." `
`"......I'm back." `
`"Mama, welcome hoooooooome!!" `
`‘Uryu-!! `
`Mama came back, Mama came back!’ `
`Waiting to greet Rosa as she returned home all tired out... `
`was Maria, in an unbelievably good mood, holding Sakutaro. `
`Most likely, Rosa's worn-out expression was partly because she really was tired, `
`...but partly because it would be a pain when Maria, who should've been grumbling after staying home alone for several days, would cling to her, sobbing. `
`However, when she was welcomed by an unbelievably happy Maria... `
`and found that her fears were unbelievably needless, Rosa couldn't hide her surprise. `
`"Wh-What's going on, Maria...? `
`You're in a great mood...?! `
`Is someone here...?!" `
`It was strange enough to make Rosa think that a friend had come over, and that she'd come home right when they were having a good time playing together. `
`But there were no other shoes by the entrance. `
`...Even though Maria was in such high spirits, she had been home alone. `
`At first, Rosa was suspicious that the cause of this unexpected good mood could be nothing good, `
`but that really was a needless fear, ...and in any event, Maria really had been in a good mood while she watched over the house. `
`......Even if Rosa's heart had been as cold and hard as a rock, ...after being welcomed with a smile like this... `
`Rosa started to honestly accept that smile, and a smile rose to her own face automatically. `
`...In that smile, you could no longer see any of the weariness of someone who'd been unable to return home for several days. `
`Maria kept talking about what a fun time she'd had playing with her stuffed animal, Sakutaro. `
`Rosa really hadn't imagined that the stuffed animal she herself had given would be so appreciated, and she couldn't hide her pleased surprise. `
`"I see. `
`So you spent the time together with Sakutaro. `
`Well done, Maria. `
`Here's a present for Maria and Sakutaro for being so good." `
`‘Uryu-! `
`A present! `
`A present!’ `
`"Uu-! `
`What is it, what is it?!" `
`Both Maria and Sakutaro started jumping around. `
`There were two presents. `
`One contained an assortment of Western sweets. `
`Inside was a Scotch cake. `
`It looked to be of very high quality. `
`But Maria was more interested in the other one. `
`The other one was an even bigger box, and it was pretty heavy. `
`"Go ahead and open it. `
`They might become new friends for you and Sakutaro, okay?" `
`"Wowwwwwwwwww...! `
`What's this?! `
`What's this?!!" `
`Inside, laid there like chess pieces, were about 20 small ceramic figures shaped like animals. `
`Squirrels, rabbits, small birds, dogs and cats. `
`And they were all holding musical instruments. `
`In addition to them, there was also a panorama-style background. `
`A forest scene was drawn on it. `
`The small forest animals were gathered in a plaza and looked like they were having a good time. `
`Rosa set it up on the table. `
`...And when she then lined up the ceramic figures like chess pieces in front of it, `
`......it became a band of forest animals. `
`"Isn't it wonderful? `
`I saw it in a store window, and I was taken with it at a glance. `
`This is a present for you for being such a good girl home alone, Maria." `
`"Uuuu---!!! `
`Thank you, Mama!!! `
`Awesome, Sakutaro! `
`Look how much our friends have grown...! `
`It's just like you said, Sakutaro. `
`It was true that if we had a fun, noisy time, we'd get more friends...!" `
`‘Right, didn't I tell you? `
`Look, we have more friends, look, we have more friends! `
`Uryu-{p:0:♪}’ `
`Relieved that her gift had been appreciated, `
`Rosa remembered that she'd been filled with several days of weariness... `
`"Mama, you really worked hard...! `
`Go take a shower. `
`If you take a hot one, I'm sure your weariness will go away. `
`Wanna take a bath? `
`I'll choose what to put in the bath today!" `
`"Thank you. `
`But it's already late, so get ready to go to bed. `
`Mama is tired, so I'll just take a shower and go to sleep. `
`I have to get up early tomorrow." `
`"Yeah, got it! `
`Here, Mama, I'll take your coat off for youuu." `
`"I can do it myself... `
`...Oh, thank you." `
`"Mama, your coat is full of smells from outside. `
`...Uu-? `
`Oh, sorry, something fell out. `
`I'll pick it up, okay?" `
`When she took Rosa's coat, a receipt or ticket stub or something fell out. `
`...It had been in Mama's pocket, so it was probably important. `
`Maria hurriedly picked it up... `
`It looked like a ticket for the Green Car or the Shinkansen or something. `
`......Atami? `
`Wasn't that a place famous for its hot springs...? `
`At that moment, `
`...with a razor-sharp sound, the warm atmosphere shattered. `
`Instead of the Rosa who had been there just a second ago, enjoying the gift with her daughter and recovering from her weariness with a long-awaited return home, `
`......there stood a person who looked exactly the same, but who had a completely different, terrifying expression on her face. `
`...In her hand was the ticket stub that Maria had picked up. `
`...She had stolen it from Maria's hand in an instant. `
`Just a few seconds too late, `
`...by the pain of her hand that had been hit, `
`and her mother's expression, `
`Maria realized that she must have done something wrong. `
`But she didn't know what she had done that had gotten her in trouble. `
`...It was probably because of that ticket stub-like thing. `
`Was she not supposed...to touch it......? `
`Even though she had tried so hard to welcome Mama with fun and happiness, `
`...she had touched something important to Mama without asking, and had ruined that pleasant atmosphere... `
`...So Maria apologized immediately. `
`"...S-Sorry......" `
`"......! `
`......" `
`Even though she must have heard those words of apology, Rosa's expression actually darkened. `
`...Maybe those weren't the words she had been hoping for. `
`Maria didn't know what to do...and stared at her mother's reaction... `
`Then, even though it should've been such an important ticket stub, `
`Rosa crushed it up and hurried off to her room... `
`Maria...didn't really understand what she had done wrong... `
`"......Uu-... `
`...I must've... `
`...done something I shouldn't have... `
`...That paper must've been something important for Mama's work. `
`And I touched it without asking..." `
`‘Uryu... `
`...You didn't do anything wrong, Maria...... `
`...That's why tonight was so very happy.’ `
`"Yeah. `
`...Happy." `
`‘And when Mama takes a bath and clears her head, she'll go back to being the normal, nice Mama. `
`So you mustn't worry about it. `
`Uryu.’ `
`"You're right... `
`Mama's tired too. `
`...Uu-, mustn't worry about it. `
`After all, we were so happy tonight." `
`‘Uryu.’ `
`"......Just stop it. `
`...I can't watch this." `
`"......Ange, I think you're looking for happiness in the wrong way." `
`"You're the one who's wrong, Onee-chan!! `
`How can you call this happiness...?!! `
`It's so...pitiful that I can't watch anymore!!" `
`"What is...? `
`That Mama suddenly got mad? `
`......That happens sometimes when humans get tired. `
`...Condemning a person because of a momentary misplaced emotion isn't very adult of you, Ange." `
`"...I can't believe I'm hearing this from a nine year old... `
`But that's not the problem! `
`That ticket stub you picked up was clearly strange!" `
`"What was? `
`There was nothing strange about it, and it has nothing to do with the happiness of that night, right...?" `
`"Aunt Rosa called because she'd be staying over at her company because of work, right?! `
`Why Atami?! `
`Isn't that what you call a vacation?! `
`It means she left you and went on a vacation, right?! `
`And you normally don't go on a vacation by yourse-" `
`"Even if that was a ticket for Atami, `
`that alone doesn't make it proof that Mama lied and went on a vacation, right...?" `
`"She lied on the phone, and then she changed her expression so drastically and grabbed it from you! `
`What more proof could you want...?!!" `
`"......It might have been from a business trip long ago, right? `
`Or maybe she just happened to pick up some trash and put it in her pocket. `
`It might've been a receipt from someone who worked for her, who went on a business trip. `
`...In that case, it would be important for her work. `
`It wasn't a toy, so I can understand why Mama took it away. `
`...This evidence you're talking about is only circumstantial. `
`Imagination and delusions. `
`......I don't know why you're interpreting it in a way that makes our relationship worse." `
`"I'm the one who doesn't understand why you're interpreting it in a way that's so convenient for Aunt Rosa!!" `
`"......As I thought, you're a pitiable child, Ange. `
`......Even though there are so many Fragments lying about you that could make you happy, `
`you can't find them." `
`"...Instead, you only look at unhappy Fragments and continue to get hurt. `
`...That's why you're scared of being hurt... `
`and only start looking for happiness after you check to make sure there's nothing around you that could hurt you." `
`".........When I talk with you, Onee-chan, it gets hard to tell which one of us isn't making sense." `
`"You know what? `
`There are lots of happy and unhappy Fragments, and they fill the world up. `
`So people who can't find happiness right beside them won't be able to find it no matter how hard they look. `
`...Like Tyltyl and Mytyl searching for the blue bird." `
`"......Oh yeah. `
`That story with a moral." `
`"You're the complete opposite, Ange. `
`You're searching for a world without a Fragment of unhappiness. `
`But that's the same as the blue bird. `
`So you'll be unable to find your happiness for all eternity. `
`......Is Battler Hansel? `
`Or is he the blue bird...?" `
`"...Give it a rest already. `
`......In any event, I understand that a night of happiness was wasted because of a single scrap of paper." `
`"It sure is scary. `
`That a single scrap of paper could do that. `
`...In that case, maybe the power to get your happiness back can also lie in a single scrap of paper, right?" `
`Just when she'd finally been able to communicate with Maria after so long... `
`Rosa's face twisted with a mixture of anger, sadness, and a fierce self-hatred as she flew into her room and closed the door. `
`......Maria's "sorry" had sliced into her chest sharper than a knife. `
`At that time, `
`...she noticed a cute envelope placed on her study table. `
`It was probably something that had come with a girls' magazine. `
`......To Mama: `
`Let me share my happiness with you, ...it said. `
`She took it, ......and after hesitating, opened it...and read what was inside. `
`............ `
`Then, after dotting the surface of the paper... `
`with two large tears... `
`...she flew out of the room, `
`hugged Maria from behind as she headed for the bathroom, `
`......buried her face into her daughter's back... `
`and cried. `
`And, realizing that she was the one who should truly be saying sorry, `
`... `
`... `
`... `
`... `
`she apologized. `
`Why is Mama apologizing...? `
`There was no answer to that question... `
`"......Look. `
`We already made up. `
`......Something like that was absolutely nothing to worry about, because of the friendship Mama and I share." `
`"......... `
`......To me, your happiness is...too painful, Maria onee-chan." `
`"...I understand how you feel, more or less. `
`...Before I realized I had that "power", `
`...even I was a pitiful child who could only find Fragments filled with misfortune, just like you are now." `
`"......What is that "power"? `
`This power that I don't have, but you do... `
`...Are you saying that I'm unfortunate and you're blessed because I don't have that? `
`......Just what is this thing you can't describe except with an abstract word like "power"...?" `
`"Yeah. `
`You do want to know that, Ange. `
`...That's why you've been reading my story so far. `
`......Of course, I'll teach you. `
`I'll show you the secret to that power. `
`...And it's something I taught you about long ago, when you were little, right...? `
`Did you forget...?" `
`"It's okay, I remember. `
`...Now I... `
`...no, she. `
`She will teach you." `
`"......She...? `
`Who's that?" `
`{a:c: `
`"I shall teach you in {f:5:Maria}'s place."} `
`".........B‐ `
`{f:5:Beatrice}........." `
`"The "power" {f:5:Maria} has, but you do not." `
`"Yeah. `
`The "power" I have, but Ange doesn't." `
`——It's...magic. `
`Maria and Beato said it together. `
`And then they started giggling because they'd said it at the same time. `
`...It was an innocent reaction, one that didn't seem like Beato at all. `
`Black tea was arranged on a table in a peaceful garden, `
`and Beato, Maria, and Sakutarou, who was sitting on Maria's lap, were having fun chatting... `
`"......Hoh. `
`I see, he is called Sakutarou. `
`So this is your best friend!" `
`‘Uryu... `
`Nice to meet you, I'm Sakutarou...’ `
`"Uu-, Sakutaro's shy, so he's nervous. `
`It's okay, {f:5:Beatrice} is also a great friend of mine...!" `
`‘Uryu. `
`Are Maria's friends...my friends...?’ `
`"Yeah!" `
`‘Uryu. ...Then, am I {f:5:Beatrice}'s friend too?’ `
`"Yeah!" `
`‘Uryu-!’ `
`"...Maria, does something like this happen frequently for you in your everyday life?" `
`"Uu-? `
`What?" `
`"Is breathing a spirit of magic into inorganic matter and giving it life like this... `
`commonplace in your everyday life?" `
`"...Uu-. `
`Sakutaro isn't inorganic matter, he's a lion cub." `
`‘Uryu-!’ `
`"Hmm... `
`...A stuffed animal makes for an excellent vessel. `
`It is not uncommon for spirits to be made to reside in them...when they are spoken to by innocent children with no toxin." `
`According to {f:5:Beatrice}, every time a child plays with dolls, `
`the dolls actually gain a will and converse with them, sometimes even moving by their own will. `
`However, because of their innocence, the power imbued into such a vessel is very weak. `
`If they get struck with even a tiny bit of the toxin from a Human's common sense, which says that there's no way a doll can talk or move, `
`they instantly revert to being non-speaking dolls... `
`"However, ...this Sakutarou stuffed animal of yours is different." `
`"Uu-! `
`Sakutaro is a stuffed animal, but he isn't ooone!" `
`‘Uryu-! `
`I'm a lion cub! `
`Ro-, ro-, ...uryu-!’ `
`"Sakutaro is a lion cub, but he's still a kid, so he can't roar sometimes. `
`Uryuuryuuryu{p:0:♪}" `
`‘Uryuuryuuryu-!’ `
`Gazing at Maria, who was playing around with Sakutaro by the table loaded with tea, {f:5:Beatrice} let out a sigh of admiration. `
`"......How incredible. `
`This Sakutarou, with a cloth and cotton vessel as a shell, has completely materialized into the human world. `
`He has his own personality, talks with the summoner freely, `
`{i:and even moves by his own will}." `
`"...And even more surprising...is that Maria did not summon him using the name of a person from another world, `
`but created him out of the sea of zero." `
`After that, Maria boasted to Beato that Sakutarou wasn't her only friend, and that she had many more of them back at home. `
`It seemed there were other similar stuffed animals and dolls who could talk and move of their own will like Sakutarou. `
`It was something natural for Maria. `
`It was natural for stuffed animals to talk, move, and become her friends of their own will. `
`...When she saw that Maria accepted this as something natural, as a witch, {f:5:Beatrice} felt a respect bordering on awe. `
`"......Maria, `
`without a doubt, that power of yours is magic." `
`"It's magic...? `
`I'm still a witch apprentice, so I can't use magic yet, right...?" `
`"No, it is magic. `
`......Because you cannot use it consciously, you are still an apprentice, `
`...but even so, what magical power it is! `
`The materialization of your friend, Sakutarou, is excellent proof of that." `
`"Materialization...?" `
`"Indeed. `
`In your case, it may even be fitting to call it creation. `
`...A piece of inorganic matter that would have no soul at all in another's hands can have a soul sent into it through your magic." `
`"Furthermore, that strong magical power lies in the human world. `
`...In this era so filled with the toxin that denies magic, summoning a magical power that can materialize a single life-form is not easy even for me." `
`It isn't hard to give birth to any number of soulless beings. `
`However, giving birth to a being with a soul is very difficult. `
`...This is what Beato asserted. `
`"......I don't really understand what you're saying, Beato. `
`You're saying Sakutaro is amazing...?" `
`"Both you and Sakutarou are incredible. `
`...You should be proud. `
`...I see, that which Kinzo desired above all else seems to dwell most strongly within you." `
`"I don't have a clue why Beato is praising Maria so much. `
`Right, Sakutaro?" `
`‘Uryu-!’ `
`"...What should be truly admired is not only that a soul has been made to reside in a stuffed animal. `
`Even more significant is the fact that you have changed your own worldview. `
`...When it comes to giving birth to something from nothing, you stand out from the crowd." `
`"...It is easy to make 100 from 1. `
`However, giving birth to 1 from 0 is not. `
`...When you do become a full witch, beyond just becoming a match for me, you might grow into a Great Witch that even I must acknowledge as superior." `
`"A Witch of Origins, perhaps. `
`......I'm really looking forward to your future." `
`"Uu-! `
`Beato said I have talent as a witch!" `
`‘Isn't that great, Maria?! `
`Uryu, Beato, ...thank you for praising Maria.’ `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`No need to thank me, Sakutarou. `
`That red muffler truly suits you. `
`And I am envious of the talent of your master, who was able to give birth to a friend like you." `
`‘Uryu-! `
`Thanks for complimenting my muffler. `
`This is a present I got from Maria. `
`It's my favorite.’ `
`"And its size is truly like a muffler that was created just for you. `
`...I see, I must also give my new friend some kind of present." `
`"Uu-? `
`Beato is giving Sakutaro a present...?" `
`"Of course, a gift from a witch must be something with magical power. `
`In that case, so that he can be your friend for all time, and so that you can have even more fun playing with him, `
`I shall give Sakutarou my magic power. `
`With that, he should be able to materialize even more strongly." `
`"Uu-? `
`I'll be able to have much more fun playing with Sakutaro...? `
`How's that?" `
`‘Uryu...? `
`What could it be, Maria...? `
`Is it something scary...?’ `
`"Don't worry. `
`Beato won't do anything scary. `
`Right, {f:5:Beatrice}?!" `
`"Indeed. `
`I believe you will like it. `
`......So, to make him materialize even more strongly, a stronger image will be necessary. `
`......Well, well, what to do. `
`Hmmmmmmmmmm..." `
`Beato crossed her arms and thought about what she could do to please them even more. `
`Then, right there, `
`......was the form of yet another witch. `
`It was Beato's teacher, {f:5:Virgilia}. `
`{f:5:Virgilia} truly was a Great Witch. `
`...Since Maria already thought of Beato as a Great Witch, this person Beato called a Great Witch must've been a Great Great Witch. `
`According to Beato, she still didn't even rise up to this witch's feet when it came to magical power. `
`"My, my. `
`I thought I heard some cheery voices. `
`What a fun tea party this seems to be..." `
`"Oh, Teacher. `
`Perfect timing. `
`I want you to look at this lion cub. `
`I hear he's Maria's new friend." `
`"Ho ho ho. `
`What a lovely lion-san. `
`...I wonder if he can greet me? `
`Hello, nice to meet you...?" `
`‘U-Uryu-! `
`I-I'm Sakutarou.’ `
`Sakutaro fell to Maria's lap, greeting {f:5:Virgilia} with half of his face poking out over the edge of the table. `
`...It seemed he was very nervous, since this was a witch that even Beato called Teacher. `
`"Ho ho ho. `
`What an adorable name. `
`...As a reward for giving such a good greeting, here's a sweet for you." `
`After waving her hands about, {f:5:Virgilia} held the palm of her hand upwards, as though she was lightly grabbing at the empty air. `
`Then, she held her fist out in front of Sakutaro. `
`......When she opened her fist, there was one of those individually wrapped cough drops. `
`‘Uryu-?! `
`Maria, it's candy, awesome, awesome...!!’ `
`"Uu-! `
`Isn't that great, Sakutaro! `
`Make sure to thank her." `
`‘Uryu. `
`Thank you very much for the candy. `
`...*gulp*.’ `
`Even though {f:5:Virgilia} was a Great Great Witch, she still treated a stuffed animal like Sakutarou to an elegant greeting. `
`"Still, Teacher. Cough drops? Are you someone's granny or something...?! `
`Can't you at least pull out some strawberry-milk candy?" `
`"How rude. `
`In that case, I won't be giving you any more." `
`"Kuhhyahhyahhya, sorry, sorry. `
`......Well then, Maria. `
`Take out your grimoire. `
`And, of course, your writing tools." `
`"Uu-? `
`Yeah, I'll take it out. `
`What should I write?" `
`"...Oh, what are you starting?" `
`"I will use a magic I learned from you, Teacher. `
`...Magic to make a resident of another world materialize into a vessel. `
`I think that by applying that, we may be able to further strengthen the power that makes this friend of Maria's materialize. `
`...I wanted to give that as a gift to Maria and her friend." `
`"I see. `
`...For a being that has already materialized, it shouldn't be that difficult. `
`That could become a wonderful gift. `
`Well then, I shall help too, if only a little." `
`"It would be very reassuring if you would sign for this magic as a witness, Teacher...! `
`Be glad, Maria. `
`This will be a wonderful gift...!" `
`‘Uryu...? `
`What's happening...? `
`It isn't scary, is it? `
`Is it...?’ `
`"Don't know. `
`But I don't think it's scary. `
`...What could it be? I can't wait." `
`Beato borrowed the grimoire from Maria's handbag and majestically flipped through the pages. `
`...Then, she found an empty page among those with magic circles drawn on them...and flattened it out. `
`After gazing at Sakutarou with a grin, she suddenly started moving her pen. `
`...It was something like a written declaration made by witches to a high-order world. `
`It was magic whose effect could be controlled if {f:5:Beatrice} wrote and {f:5:Virgilia} signed. `
`Maria didn't understand what Beato was writing at first, but partway through, she figured out the wonderful magical power of this document, and her eyes began to sparkle... `
`‘Uryu?! `
`Uryu?! `
`What is it, Maria, what's she drawing?! `
`Uryuuryu?!’ `
`Sakutarou was on her lap, so he didn't know what was being written on the table. `
`...But even if he had seen, Sakutarou probably wouldn't have understood. `
`"Awesome, Sakutaro!! `
`Wait a bit, almost done, almost done! `
`It's amazing, Beato, amazing!!" `
`"......When it comes to writing documents of power, this child's talent is magnificent. `
`You might even serve well as a Secretary in the spirit world." `
`"How's this...?! `
`Not so bad, right...?!" `
`After finishing her writing with an intense amount of concentration, Beato looked over the document again from a distance. `
`...It seemed she was fairly satisfied with her work. `
`And Maria, who was also peeking in at it, let out a cry of wonder. `
`"...Awesome, Beato!! `
`Cuuute!! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!!" `
`"By the name of the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, I now acknowledge Sakutarou, {f:5:Maria}'s child. `
`......Teacher, if you would sign as a witness!" `
`"Yes, yes. `
`...By my name, I witness and acknowledge this oath. `
`......It is done." `
`{f:5:Virgilia} signed, completing the written declaration. `
`It was a document with the power to proclaim to the beings of a higher world that Sakutarou had most certainly materialized in the human world. `
`Sakutarou, who had been born from Maria, was nominated by the two witches, {f:5:Beatrice} and {f:5:Virgilia}, `
`and just now, his existence had been acknowledged by the higher world. `
`...That itself was the great magic of materialization. `
`According to Beato, it was apparently quite fortunate that {f:5:Virgilia} was there. `
`After all, depending on the number and quality of witches that signed proclamations to the higher world, the power that resided in them could change drastically. `
`{f:5:Virgilia} in particular had many friends in that higher plane, `
`so her signature gave the proclamation a power with which Beato's couldn't even compare. `
`"By this proclamation, I accept you, Sakutarou, as an individual with his own ego. `
`And I welcome you as a friend in accordance with the contract of Mariage Sorcière. `
`From now on, Sakutarou is our common friend." `
`"And for that, I shall bestow upon you a fitting form as a gift. `
`Accept it." `
`With the grimoire still opened to the page with the proclamation, she turned it around and handed it to Maria. `
`Maria showed it to Sakutarou on her lap. `
`When Sakutarou beheld that proclamation, `
`......he felt something hot and bright begin to dwell... `
`in his body made of cloth and cotton. `
`Even as he looked around, nervous at this sensation he'd never felt before, that power strengthened, `
`...and eventually, a bright light completely swallowed him up... `
`‘Uryu...? `
`Uryuuryuuryuuryu...!’ `
`Then, when that light disappeared... `
`......There, Maria's friend Sakutarou held a new form and {i:existed}. `
`"Uu-uu-uu-! `
`You're cute, Sakutaro! `
`Reeeally cute!" `
`‘Uryu...? `
`Uryu-... `
`Does it really look good on me? `
`It isn't embarrassing...?’ `
`"Ho ho ho ho. `
`It is a very lovely form, Sakutarou-chan." `
`"I figured the muffler was his charm point. `
`And the ears! `
`Animal ears sure are nice, truly cute! `
`Let me nibble 'em later. `
`*cackle*!" `
`"Thank you, {f:5:Beatrice}!! `
`Thank you very much for the wonderful present!!" `
`"There is no need for thanks. `
`This is out of respect for your wonderful magic and your friend. `
`......And, now that you have reached this level, it would not be odd for you to graduate from being an apprentice at any time. `
`From now on, I shall instruct you on even more new and fun magic. `
`...From this point forward, you may call yourself {f:5:Maria}, an Apprentice Witch of Origins." `
`"A Witch of Origins...?" `
`"Indeed. `
`It is the title of a witch who seeks to become a Creator. `
`Right now, you are just an Enchanter (a magician specializing in forms of magical enhancement) who has only enough strength to breathe magical power into the small objects around her. `
`...But after one thousand years of training, you could conceivably use the magical compendium that resides inside your heart to create a galaxy." `
`"...The talent of a Witch of Origins is very rare. `
`Even though everyone has it when they are young, no one can continue to hold onto it. `
`...This title is also proof that you have not lost your untainted heart." `
`"Uu-!! `
`A Witch of Origins, awesome! `
`I'll become one! `
`I'm Maria, an Apprentice Witch of Origins!" `
`"Maria, that's so incredible...! `
`A Witch of Origins, incredible, amazing, uryu-!" `
`"Eventually, you will be able to call yourself a full witch: Lady {f:5:Maria}, Witch of Origins. `
`...It may be a good time now to give not only Sakutarou, but you as well, an appearance fitting for your rank. `
`...Here. `
`I shall give a proper outfit for one who, while still an apprentice, is worthy of using the title of a witch." `
`When Beato waved the pipe that was her cane, `
`many gold butterflies that had appeared out of nowhere grouped around Maria, giving her a wonderful dress. `
`It certainly was fitting for the girl who would eventually take the name of the Witch of Origins, combining both cuteness and dignity... `
`"Amazing...!! `
`Awesome awesome awesome awesome!! `
`Cute, cute! `
`I wanna show these clothes to Mama too...!! `
`Can I?" `
`"The full dress of a witch must not be shown indiscriminately. `
`It's value increases if you're stingy with it. `
`*cackle*!" `
`Then, the Great Witch, the witch, the witch's apprentice, and their new friend, Sakutarou, enjoyed a lively tea party... `
`"......See? `
`Look how happy I am. `
`And look how fun this is." `
`"............" `
`"Please, don't be afraid of being happy. `
`Becoming happy isn't the same thing as accepting your current misfortune. `
`It means creating a new happiness out of your current misfortune. `
`That is the Magic of Origins." `
`"...I...didn't want to acknowledge my current world. `
`...I couldn't bear to accept such an isolated and painful world. `
`...That's why, even though I was entranced by your world, Maria onee-chan, `
`...I couldn't cross the final line." `
`"......I'll teach you. `
`About my Magic of Origins. `
`No, I taught you before, right? `
`And you used it before. `
`Did you forget...?" `
`"............" `
`"You were also a witch apprentice, Ange, with your name entered into Mariage Sorcière, weren't you?" `
`"......Yeah. `
`That was true. `
`......Mariage Sorcière... `
`...That takes me back. `
`...I also had my name entered in there at one point, didn't I...?" `
