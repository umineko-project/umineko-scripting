`The world whitened... `
`It wasn't white. `
`...It was a gold color as bright as can be. `
`There...was the beautiful Ushiromiya family rose garden. `
`However, the flowers on the roses were all gold. `
`...The nectar was also gold-colored. `
`The butterflies gathered there were gold as well. `
`......This is...the Golden Land...... `
`The promised land that the witches of Mariage Sorcière had finally been guided to... `
`There, all wishes are granted, and all magic and dreams are born. `
`......In that garden of gold roses... `
`were two...and only two...witches. `
`I appeared as an uninvited guest, `
`making that atmosphere tremble with unrest. `
`......What was to them a wind of misfortune shook the golden roses. `
`The incredibly beautiful scene formed by the golden rose petals scattered by the wind... `
`was clearly something not of this world... `
`The two who had been taking a walk on a path of golden roses noticed me and were surprised. `
`"...Ange...? `
`......Beato, it's Ange...!!" `
`"......How did you get here...? `
`......Leave us alone. `
`I shall no longer invite anyone here." `
`Beato spoke coldly. `
`......She seemed like a completely different person from the boldly sneering woman she had once been. `
`She had closed off her heart...and shut herself up in a world where she was alone with Maria onee-chan. `
`A world where she could always be alone with a friendly Maria onee-chan, `
`lecturing about magic while drinking tea. `
`...With no one to hurry them...and nothing to hold them back. `
`A world where not a single person who might hurt them existed. `
`Yes, to the two of them, it was a small, perfect universe... `
`"......Sorry. `
`...I can't have you shutting yourself up in here. `
`...We can't continue the game unless you come back." `
`"I said I stopped because I'd tired of it. `
`I will not return to the game again." `
`"......Beato will always be here with me. `
`Here, we'll drink tea together and think of lots of ways to play...! `
`You can play with us too, Ange." `
`"...{f:5:Maria}, `
`I believe I said that mustn't happen. `
`I am satisfied as long as I have you alone." `
`"Say that you too are satisfied as long as you have me." `
`"......... `
`...Yeah. `
`...Thank you. `
`The only person who needs me that much is you, Beato. `
`So, I'll be with you. `
`Just us is enough." `
`"......{f:5:Maria}, ...thanks... `
`......I am grateful......" `
`Beato held Maria tight, `
`even creating a small, warm universe between their joined arms... `
`......It was probably the birth of the smallest universe in the world. `
`...The smallest universe in the world, which a pair who needed each other could give birth to... `
`No matter how small it was, it was a complete world. `
`......But, I had to tear it apart. `
`............ `
`"...Sorry, `
`......but I can't let it go like that. `
`I came to smash this Golden Land of Mariage Sorcière." `
`"............Why... `
`...are you going to break... `
`...my world......? `
`A-Are you saying that this world is causing anyone other than Maria and me trouble...?!" `
`"You've left Onii-chan waiting all this time... `
`in a game you started and then abandoned without finishing! `
`If you don't return to your seat, the contest won't end for all eternity...!!" `
`"......Hahahahaha, ha...! `
`There is no longer a single player in that game. `
`Battler vanished, and I did as well, coming here. `
`That game is already over." `
`"It is not over! `
`You started that game, didn't you?!! `
`Take proper responsibility and see it through to the very end!" `
`Will you defeat Battler and give birth to the world you truly wished for?! `
`Or will you be defeated and everything swallowed up by your magic released?!! `
`Take responsibility until the very end!!" `
`"......Don't, Ange. `
`Beato will spend her time in this world, alone with me for eternity. `
`...And I don't need anything else, as long as I have Beato. `
`...Here, all wishes are granted. `
`Everything is here." `
`......This Golden Land is made up of nothing more than the crystallization of Beatrice's and Maria onee-chan's thoughts. `
`......To drag Beato out of this world, `
`......I have to... `
`destroy it...... `
`.........I will destroy this Golden Land, `
`......which must be a final, peaceful world in Beatrice's eyes... `
`"Onee-chan, that's wrong. `
`This Golden Land is a liar. `
`It won't grant the one wish you truly want granted." `
`"......That's not true!! `
`Anything can be granted here! `
`Look, there's even a nice Mama here!!" `
`Gold butterflies gathered behind Maria, `
`forming into a kindly smiling Aunt Rosa. `
`......After smiling sweetly at me, `
`it became golden petals and crumbled. `
`"Here, anything can be created. `
`Even Ange, even Battler, even George onii-chan, even Jessica onee-chan...!!" `
`"You can summon as many as you want, and everyone is nice...!! `
`You come too, Ange, and let's play together...!!" `
`......Sorry, Onee-chan...... `
`"And what about Sakutarou...?" `
`"......!" `
`Upon hearing Sakutarou's name, Onee-chan looked like she was choking. `
`"Stop it... `
`Do not speak that name..." `
`Beato's expression changed as well. `
`And she hugged Maria, guarding her shoulders. `
`...Sakutarou's name was still taboo for Onee-chan. `
`"Why can't I say it? `
`It's the name of Maria onee-chan's best friend. `
`...Why won't you invite that close friend to this wonderful Golden Land? `
`Why, in this Golden Land where any wish can be granted, is Sakutarou the only one you cannot summon?" `
`"Th-That is... `
`...It's all right, {f:5:Maria}. `
`You don't have to remember Sakutarou-" `
`"......Sakutaro was killed by Mama!!!!" `
`Maria onee-chan flew into a rage with a terrible expression on her face. `
`Surprised by that voice, the butterflies throughout the garden flew up, `
`...blowing around like a typhoon of flower petals. `
`"Yes, I know. `
`Aunt Rosa...took your precious stuffed animal, Sakutarou, and tore him apart...!!" `
`"GYAAAAAAAaaaAAAAAAAAAAaAAAaaAAHHHH!!!" `
`Maria's scream became a storm that violently scattered the golden petals and leaves. `
`It truly was a storm of gold. `
`"Stop...!! `
`Stop stop stop...!!! `
`Why are you trying to reopen the wound in {f:5:Maria}'s heart...?! `
`Don't defile the sleep of this precious friend to both Maria and myself...!!" `
`"In that case, why don't you revive that precious friend for her with your magic?" `
`"I'd do it if I could...!! `
`But that stuffed animal was an article Rosa created herself! `
`The magical meaning of that individual object being torn apart is-" `
`"Don't try to fool anyone. `
`Why can't you revive Sakutarou? `
`There's only one answer. `
`It's because you aren't a real witch!" `
`"......I can revive him...!! `
`With my magic, I can revive him as often as I want, like this!! `
`I could even bury this garden in Sakutarous...!!" `
`"Yeah, I'll bet you could, with your magic! `
`But Onee-chan definitely wouldn't be able to see the Sakutarous you create!" `
`"......You know why, right? `
`I'll say it again. `
`It's because you aren't a real witch...!!" `
`"Stop iiiiiiiiiit!! `
`Why do you keep saying such mean things, Ange...?! `
`Beato can use a lot of magic...! `
`She's a wonderful witch...!!" `
`"She couldn't revive just Sakutaro, ...but she can do absolutely anything else...!! `
`So, I can at least...do without... `
`Sakutaro..." `
`"No, Onee-chan, that's wrong. `
`......There's nothing a witch can't do. `
`As soon as she couldn't do that, `
`it was clear that Beatrice wasn't a real witch." `
`"Th-That's wrong...!! `
`It's because Sakutaro's stuffed animal vessel was something Mama made specially herself, and-" `
`"And that's why she can't revive him? `
`Is Beatrice's...your magic so inconvenient?" `
`"Gah, ......i-in that case, ...are you saying you can revive Sakutarou?! `
`Are you saying you can do that with your magic?!" `
`"I can." `
`"......What......?" `
`"Maria onee-chan!! `
`I'll show you some real magic. `
`I'll revive Sakutarou for you!!" `
`"......Re‐ `
`Really...? `
`Even Beatrice couldn't do it, right...? `
`...R- `
`Really...?!" `
`"Yes, I can! `
`In exchange, promise me. `
`Once I've revived Sakutarou..." `
`"Yes...!" `
`"...Leave this Golden Land." `
`"......!" `
`"I-I will not permit that...!! `
`This world is {f:5:Maria}'s and mine!! `
`If {f:5:Maria} leaves, `
`...it will break...!!" `
`The minimum number of Humans it takes to create a universe is two. `
`Otherwise, that world is destroyed. `
`To drag out the witch shut away in the Golden Land, I'll have to destroy this world...! `
`"...Yes, that's the proof that you aren't a witch. `
`...A real witch can create a universe alone. `
`The Mariage Sorcière Alliance of Witches! `
`...The very existence of this alliance proves that you aren't a witch...!!" `
`"N-No...!! `
`I won't hand {f:5:Maria} over...!! `
`I hate you, leave right now...!! `
`Get out of heeeeeeeeeeeere!!" `
`"Dragging everyone into a game of your own accord, then getting bored and chasing them out when your mood changes!! `
`How selfish can you be? `
`Take a look, Beatrice!! `
`And you, Maria onee-chan!! `
`This...is true magic......!!!" `
`"...W-Will you really revive Sakutaro...?!" `
`"There's no way you can!! `
`This is a Golden Land for Maria and me alone...! `
`There is not a single spell that an outsider like you could use! `
`As you are now, you couldn't even create a single butterfly!!" `
`"Be quiet, Beato!! `
`Don't get in Ange's way...!!" `
`When Maria yelled, `
`...the storm suddenly stopped, and the area returned to silence. `
`......The scene, as a massive number of golden petals that had been blown upwards quietly drifted down, `
`...was fantastical, as though a golden snow was falling... `
`Maria, thinking about this unlikely, if-only miracle, `
`had unconsciously joined her hands together as though praying. `
`...Beato watched Maria do this, her heart racing. `
`.........If the extremely unlikely were to happen, `
`...Maria would... `
`...this world would... `
`But...it's unthinkable...! `
`Absolutely impossible... `
`That stuffed animal, which had been the only one in the world, was torn apart and thrown away, `
`and not a thread remained. `
`Reviving it was certainly and absolutely impossible...!! `
`{p:1:This is my Golden Land}...! `
`{p:1:A world where magic that isn't mine certainly cannot exist}!!! `
`I- `
`If you think you can do it, `
`...let's see what you've got, Ushiromiya Angeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!" `
`At Beato's scream-like cry, the world lost its sound. `
`I slowly...recited the incantation...for true magic... `
`"......Come, try to remember. `
`Maria's close friend, Sakutarou." `
`"...Try and remember what form you had." `
`"......Try and remember what a lovable stuffed animal you were." `
`"Huh, .........ah, ...ah......" `
`"............!" `
`...Expressions of shock rose to both of their faces. `
`Then, ...pushing Beato's elbow aside, Maria dashed forward... `
`"-kutaro...... `
`......Sakutaro......!!" `
`Then, `
`......she clung to us both. `
`"...It's all right. `
`Sakutarou...isn't going to disappear. `
`...... `
`‘Uryu, `
`Maria, I'm home.’" `
`"Sakutaro, `
`...Sakutaro, `
`...uuuuuuuuuuuuuuu, `
`waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuu!! `
`Sakutarooooooo, `
`...I wanted to see you... `
`...so much......" `
`It was, unmistakably, `
`......that stuffed animal lion, `
`...Sakutarou. `
`Its softness, its texture, its stitches, its everything, `
`......Maria had forgotten. `
`But, `
`......the instant she hugged that stuffed animal, it all came back to her vividly... `
`‘Uryu. `
`Maria, `
`...I'm home.’ `
`"Sakutaro, Sakutaro...!! `
`Is your body all right? `
`Does it hurt anywhere? `
`Even though...something so horrible was done to you, are you all okay...?!" `
`‘Uryu...! `
`Ange revived me with magic, so I'm perfectly fine...!’ `
`"Thank goodness, `
`...thank goodness... `
`Welcome back, Sakutaro... `
`Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!" `
`‘From now on, I'll always be with you, Maria. `
`Together for eternity. `
`...So, `
`don't let go of me, okay......?’ `
`"Yeah, ...won't let go... `
`...for all eternity........." `
`Then, still hugging Sakutarou, `
`she looked up at me with tear-filled eyes... `
`"...Thank you, Ange...! `
`......Ange's magic is amazing... `
`...How? `
`How can you revive Sakutarou?! `
`When Beato couldn't do it...!" `
`"......Impossible... `
`...Impossible... `
`...How? `
`...How can a human other than me use magic in my Golden Land?!?! `
`This is... `
`...completely impossible...!" `
`"What are you so flustered about, Beatrice? `
`.........This is...magic, right?" `
`"There's no way that's magic...!! `
`{p:1:This is my Golden Land}!! `
`{p:1:A world where magic that isn't mine certainly cannot exist}!! `
`And my `
`{p:1:magic was not able to revive Sakutarou}...!!" `
`"There's no way it could!! `
`{p:1:That stuffed animal was a special stuffed animal}! `
`{p:1:Rosa made it for her daughter's birthday, and in the entire world, only o}— `
`"......Ah, `
`.........nngg, `
`.........aaah..." `
`".........See, `
`...it's magic, right?" `
`"Ah... `
`...ooh, `
`...aah, `
`...aaahhh, `
`......aaaaaaaahhh..." `
`With this miracle that she could not possibly accept, `
`.........Beato...understood all of my magic...... `
`She looked at Maria and Sakutarou innocently frolicking around, `
`...looked at me, `
`......and then... `
`...fell to her knees, `
`...with even her hands pressed to the ground, `
`......and cried. `
`"Beatrice...! This really is magic, right...?! `
`It's magic, right?! `
`Beatrice...!!!" `
`"......Indeed... `
`...It is magic... `
`......That is... `
`real... `
`magic......" `
`"Why can Ange use a magic that even Beato couldn't?! `
`Why?! `
`Why?! `
`Ange's amazing, Ange's an amazing witch! `
`A real witch who's much, much more amazing than me...!!!" `
`"Yeah, that's right, Onee-chan. `
`.........I am the Witch of Resurrection, {f:5:Ange}. `
`...There's nothing that can't be revived by me." `
`"Amazing, incredible!! `
`Even Beato said that the magic of resurrection was the hardest!! `
`{f:5:Ange}'s incredible!! `
`A really real Great Witch...!!!" `
`At that time, Maria's and Sakutarou's forms flashed gold, `
`...and the forms of the two became golden flower petals...that crumbled away... `
`As the two became a golden wind and swirled together, `
`......they left for some other peaceful place, not here. `
`Beato had, ...as promised, banished Maria from the Golden Land. `
`"...Goodbye, ...Maria onee-chan. `
`And...be happy forever. `
`......Don't worry, you definitely exist in Onee-chan's world too. `
`But that {i:doesn't refer to you}." `
`"...............I am happy for you, `
`...Maria... `
`...As your close friend, `
`......I celebrate this reunion...from the bottom of my heart......" `
`On Beato's face...was a mixture of what was probably every expression a human could muster. `
`It was `
`joy, `
`anger, `
`and sadness. `
`"......That's...the source of magic, isn't it? `
`......Without love, `
`without sadness, `
`without anger, `
`......magic cannot be "seen"." `
`The ground shook. `
`...An earthquake. `
`......It gradually summoned greater and greater fissures... `
`and began to tear Beatrice's final paradise apart. `
`Golden butterflies fluttered about, trying to escape, but there was nowhere to escape to. `
`...And...Beatrice was the same. `
`The Golden Land began to crumble away. `
`The earth crumbled downwards like a floor falling through, `
`......and Beatrice was sucked into the depths of a jet-black darkness. `
`Then, she was mercilessly slammed against a jet-black floor. `
`...It was a dimly-lit...smoking room. `
`There was no door to exit by, and while there was a window, it let no light... `
`into Beatrice's shadowy smoking room. `
`Even though Beato was moaning from the pain of being slammed against that cold, hard floor, `
`she shakily rose to her feet... `
`There was a seat there... `
`...And the game table, ...still just as it had been when she'd left it. `
`The game board also remained in the same state that Beato had left it in. `
`"That's your seat. `
`Sit." `
`"...............So, this is the only seat... `
`...for me to sit in......?" `
`Beato put a hand against her own seat...and laughed sadly. `
`"Win or lose. `
`That's all you've been given. `
`A tie during the process of reaching that point will probably be permitted." `
`"......However, you won't be allowed to suspend the game and throw it away! `
`Will you win and survive, or lose and disappear? `
`Until one of those two things happens, you will not be permitted to rise from that chair!! `
`That should be your only duty as the host of a witch's game, as the Golden Witch, Beatrice...!!" `
`Laughing weakly, Beato... `
`sat in that seat. `
`...Then, she rested her elbows and covered her face with both hands, `
`......showing off a smile with nothing but her mouth. `
`"......Not permitted to escape an unwinnable game... `
`...Then, very well. `
`...Why don't I repeat this...until I lose...?" `
`"Quit being so fainthearted! `
`Win. `
`Use the best moves you have...!! `
`You started this game! `
`You have a duty to make the best moves possible!! `
`Give all that indecisive fooling around a rest!" `
`At that time, there was a violent sound. `
`...Beato felt a cold, pathetic sensation on her leg. `
`"...Gotcha...! `
`I finally got you, eh, Beatooo?" `
`"Oh, Great Lady Lambdadelta, is it...? `
`......To think that you were still here." `
`Beato's foot was caught in an ice-cold steel shackle, `
`...tying her to the chair she sat in. `
`...She would no longer be able to escape from this seat. `
`"Hoohhohhohoho! `
`You won't be able to escape anymore, got it? `
`I can be more persistent than I look. Surprised?" `
`"......It's more surprising that you don't realize how persistent you look." `
`"You are not permitted to leave early or suspend this game. `
`You'll fight for all eternity in order to win, okay? `
`......You don't want to lose, do you? `
`You want a little peek at the kind of wonderful world you'll be thrown into if you lose?" `
`"{f:5:Don't worry}. `
`You can win, because I, the Great Lady Lambdadelta, will be looking after you {i:constantly}, until you win, for all eternity...!!" `
`"............ `
`...Hmph, ...hahahahaha. `
`......But even if I wish to fight, there is no opponent seated across from me, correct...?" `
`"......Don't worry, I found Battler." `
`When Bernkastel appeared and clapped her hands, `
`Battler appeared from the sky and plopped into the opposite chair. `
`Battler's eyes were slightly opened, but there was no sparkle in them, almost like a doll's. `
`Without one of the pillars that established his soul, `
`......he had fallen into the depths of the depths of darkness...and had been drifting about all this time. `
`...He should have then scattered and disappeared like mist. `
`Bernkastel had managed to scrape him together. `
`It's incredible that she managed to bring him back into a human form. `
`However, even though his flesh had returned, his soul had not. `
`...It had been blown away by Beatrice after having its existence denied. `
`It wouldn't come back easily. `
`"......Battler won't run from this fight either. `
`Not until he defeats you. `
`...Just because your chances of winning are shrinking doesn't mean you'll be permitted the inelegance of abandoning everything and running. `
`Even he doesn't want that. `
`......Isn't that right, Ushiromiya Battler...?" `
`Battler didn't answer. `
`...His heart was still...dead. `
`His eyes wavered slightly at the question, but he couldn't answer. `
`"Battler...! `
`Get ahold of yourself! `
`You are here. `
`And the enemy is before your eyes...! `
`Fight! `
`Fight to win!!" `
`Battler lazily repeated that, speaking incoherently. `
`......He'd come back. `
`The wound he bore on his soul was no small thing. `
`That was only natural. `
`Beatrice had woven her red, and he had been denied. `
`He had learned that the mother he'd respected was not his birth mother, `
`...and he didn't know who he was. `
`...He was not... `
`Ushiromiya Battler...... `
`"Don't talk stupid! `
`You are Ushiromiya Battler, no one else! `
`No matter who acknowledges that or denies that, make sure you believe it yourself...!! `
`After all, you're the only one who can create your own world. `
`Don't lose the world where you're Ushiromiya Battler!" `
`"...............Then, `
`......who... `
`am I......? `
`I'm not my mom's child, right...? `
`Where was I born from...?" `
`Battler asked that question as his eyes, which still hadn't regained their sparkle, stared lazily up at the ceiling. `
`Of course, she answered right away. `
`"Yes, that's right. `
`Beato proclaimed it with the red truth. `
`...So I'll proclaim it too. `
`{p:1:Ushiromiya Battler is not Ushiromiya Asumu's son}." `
`"......Hmph, ...in that case, he is not qualified to be the opponent in my game, correct...?" `
`"Beatrice, repeat it. `
`"Ushiromiya Battler is not Ushiromiya Kinzo's grandchild"." `
`"............" `
`As Beato wrinkled her forehead, `
`...a painful-looking smile rose to her face. `
`"So you refuse to repeat it. `
`Beato proclaimed two red truths, `
`"{p:1:You are not Asumu's son}", `
`and `
`"{p:1:No one except Kinzo's grandchild Battler is qualified to be her opponent}"." `
`The following theory will allow Battler to be accepted without creating any contradictions. `
`Here's my blue truth, listen to it...!" `
`{p:2:The one who is qualified to be Beato's opponent is "Kinzo's grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler",} `
`{p:2:and whether that person is "Asumu's son" or not is not an issue}. `
`{p:2:In other words, you can be Kinzo's grandchild even if you are not Asumu's son}. `
`{p:2:As long as you are Rudolf's son}! `
`"Hmph, it was just a silly word game, wasn't it?" `
`"......Your blue truth is valid. `
`Beato, your counterargument with the red truth? `
`If you cannot counter it with the red, Battler's qualifications as an opponent will stand unchallenged." `
`"............" `
`......Battler was still out of it. `
`He still couldn't really understand what she was saying for him. `
`...But even so, his spirit was starting to come back, bit by bit... `
`"..................Then, `
`......who... `
`...am I...?" `
`"Get ahold of yourself! `
`You are Ushiromiya Battler! `
`Yeah, maybe Mother Asumu didn't give birth to you. `
`But so what?! `
`That doesn't change in the slightest the fact that she was a mother to you, right?!" `
`"......For example, what is Ushiromiya Ange to you? `
`You might not share the same blood, but she's still your little sister, right?! `
`It's not about blood, it's about bonds, right?!" `
`"......That's...right... `
`...Even though we don't share the same blood, ...Ange is... `
`...my little sister." `
`"Say it in red! `
`Say that Ange is your little sister!!" `
`"...... `
`{p:1:Ange is......my little sister}. `
`......Ah, ......I could say it." `
`She hugged Battler, who was still out of it and slumped in his chair, strongly from behind. `
`So much that it hurt. `
`"I don't know why Mother Asumu wasn't your birth mother. `
`But still, up until today and even now, you believe that she's your mother, right?! `
`In this world, there are plenty of people without even a mother, `
`...without even a family!!" `
`"Did Mother Asumu ever let you feel lonely? `
`Never, right?! `
`Don't throw your peaceful family away so easily!! `
`Your family bonds have gotten too thin after leaving your family for six years!!" `
`"You have to feel those family bonds much, much more strongly! `
`Remember!! `
`For Mother Asumu's sake as well, don't lose your love over a foolish witch's rant like this!" `
`"......... `
`......You're right... `
`...Mom was...always on my side... `
`"...............Where is this place......? `
`......It's dark...... `
`...and I wanna go home... `
`Where's... `
`all my... `
`...family...?" `
`The light still hadn't returned to Battler's eyes. `
`But...tears appeared. `
`"Your little sister is waiting at home for you to come back. `
`If even you don't come back, ...she'll be all alone forever...! `
`For your little sister's sake, please, win this witch's game...!!" `
`"............Ange...... `
`...my... `
`little sister...... `
`...But I still... `
`...don't get it... `
`......Why... `
`do I have to keep repeating this incomprehensible, cruel game with Beato...? `
`......I've... `
`had enough......" `
`"In that case, settle this game quickly and go back home!! `
`Ushiromiya Battler, how long are you going to play around in a place like this?! `
`Your little sister is waiting for you to come home!!!" `
`......That's right. `
`Battler had been caught up in this strange game before he even knew it. `
`And, still unable to understand why he was fighting, `
`he had been constantly sucked into the witch's pace, played with and made to fight. `
`That should've been his most simple and first question. `
`...Because he didn't understand that, he had lost his purpose in fighting...!! `
`That's why my voice won't reach Battler's ears...! `
`Instead of a vague purpose, like winning against the witch, or because he couldn't forgive her... `
`...He has to be aware of a purpose for which he must win. `
`".........That's right...... `
`......I want to go home...... `
`...I want to go home to Dad and Mom... `
`and Ange... `
`......I've had enough, `
`...enough of this place... `
`...I've had enough of witches, I've had enough of games and murders, `
`...enough, `
`enough..." `
`"Battler's soul...is starting to come back." `
`"......But it can't quite reach." `
`"You've had enough, right?! `
`Then fight so that you can return to your family!! `
`Destroy Beatrice and go home!!" `
`"No, ...I've had enough of witches...! `
`Enough of Beato, ...enough of everything, ...and even you're probably just another one of the witch's allies... `
`I could be betrayed again at any time...!!" `
`"{p:1:I can't trust anything, I can't trust any words that aren't red}...!! `
`Don't bother me, don't bother meeeeeeeeeeee!!" `
`Battler's soul howled. `
`She hugged his head from behind, strong enough that it hurt. `
`"{p:1:Hurry up and come home, Onii‐chan}!! `
`{p:1:Don't leave me all alone}!!!" `
`".........Huh...? `
`......Who... `
`...are you...?" `
`"{p:1:It's me, it's Ange}...!! `
`{p:1:Dad and Mom and Onii-chan...no one came home!!} `
`{p:1:I'm so lonely}!! `
`{p:1:Please, hurry up and come home}!" `
`"...A-Ange... `
`......You were......Ange......?" `
`"{p:1:That's right, I'm Ange}!! `
`{p:1:The Ushiromiya Ange of a world where no one comes home}...!! `
`.........{p:1:My entire family...never came home from Rokkenjima that day}...!!" `
`"{p:1:The witch before your eyes stole away my whole family, even you}...! `
`.........{p:1:Only you can finish her, Onii‐chan}!! `
`{p:1:Finish her}...!!" `
`"{p:1:And take your family back}!! `
`{p:1:And then.........come home to me}......!!!" `
`"......Beato did that... `
`...to my family......?" `
`"...Hmph, ......as she says. `
`I will not run away or hide from it. `
`...I stole Ushiromiya Ange's family away from her." `
`"Battler is my toy! `
`His father and mother are both my toys. `
`...I won't give them back to you. `
`...You may continue to wander all alone forever, awaiting the return of a family that will never come back...!" `
`From Ange's arms that held him, ......the painful, sad days... `
`that had been experienced by his lonely little sister...flowed into Battler... `
`...Because he'd been playing around in a place like this, `
`......his little sister had been left all by herself, ......had been forced to endure... `
`...all that pain......!! `
`"...Ange, ......Ange......!! `
`Damn, ...I......what am I doing......?!! `
`Thanks, Ange... `
`Your Onii-chan...has been forgetting something important this whole time...!" `
`Battler tried to turn around, `
`but Ange was hanging onto his head with an incredible force, so he couldn't turn back. `
`...Was it sweat? `
`Hot drops were splashing on the nape of Battler's neck. `
`...What they were...he knew from holding Ange's arm that clung to him. `
`......Because it stained Battler's hand, his fingers, ...red. `
`"......Blood... `
`...A-Ange?! `
`A-Are you okay?! `
`H-Hey...?!" `
`It dripped and splashed. `
`He didn't know what was going on. `
`Battler didn't know, because he couldn't turn around, `
`but the hot drops that stained his entire back were surely...blood. `
`"............In order to save you, Onii‐chan, `
`In order to come here, `
`there was a single rule... `
`I had to follow... `
`......This... `
`is it. `
`...Letting you, Onii-chan, `
`...know... `
`that I was... `
`...Ange......" `
`...It was so hard...... `
`Even though Onii-chan was right before my eyes, ...I couldn't even say that...... `
`As long as I followed this rule, ...I should've been able to stay by Onii-chan's side for all eternity. `
`.........You and me together... `
`to play in the game against the witch... `
`for eternity with Onii-chan... `
`"But... `
`......that's no good. `
`......Onii... `
`nnn... `
`...chan, `
`...you have to come back... `
`......Your sister's waiting for you... `
`...at home... `
`......That person isn't me, `
`......but this way, your sister... `
`will be saved......" `
`"Ange?! `
`Ange!! `
`There's so much blood...!! `
`So much, so much!!" `
`He wanted to turn around, but Ange was gripping his head too tightly. `
`However, judging by the blood that was pouring out and Ange's pained breathing, `
`he realized that something seriously wrong was happening to her right now. `
`"......Don't...worry...... `
`...I am only...a piece... `
`......You know, in chess, ...they have this move called a <sacrifice>..." `
`"Sacri...what?! `
`Who cares about chess?!! `
`Let's get you some first-aid quickly!! `
`Let go for a second, Ange...!!" `
`"......A sacrifice...is an abandoned piece. `
`For a tactical gain, you intentionally accept a loss and let a piece go..." `
`In chess, the ultimate goal is victory. `
`...So, if it can bring you to victory in the end, there's nothing wrong with sacrificing a few individual pieces. `
`Ange had coolly made a decision. `
`......She had been taught over and over again that she was a piece, not a player. `
`...In order to act like a piece and save Battler, right now, she would have to become a sacrificial piece herself. `
`......Battler had to know. `
`His purpose in this witch's game couldn't be something as abstract as finishing off the witch. `
`He had to win the game, release himself, and bring his family back home. `
`Why? `
`......Because he had family, a little sister, who was waiting for him to come home. `
`A being was created so that Ushiromiya Ange's voice could reach you. `
`That's me, {f:5:Ange} Beatrice...!! `
`I'll sacrifice the piece I am to give to you the will to fight, `
`to give you purpose! `
`My purpose isn't to play with you in a witch's game for all eternity! `
`I came to bring you Ushiromiya Ange's mourning and sadness! `
`That is my unshakable purpose! `
`"......Ange!! `
`Ange!! `
`Aaaaaaaaaarrrghhh!!!" `
`The white, thin arm that held Battler...became pale and transparent, almost like wax. `
`...And even so, the fresh blood...stained it so cruelly... `
`"...I'm......... `
`...disappear now, but... `
`...Onii-chan, fight with all you've got, `
`......and I'm sure, you'll... `
`...come back to me...... `
`......I'll be waiting, `
`......always...... `
`...I'd planned on helping you out a lot more than this, `
`...but I couldn't do anything. `
`...Sorry............" `
`"D-Don't worry about that...!! `
`You...taught me, didn't you...?! `
`You taught me why I have to win...! `
`And that...I've got to win for certain...and come back to you...!!" `
`"What......am I doing, lazing about in a place like this...?!! `
`Yeah, I won't play around anymore...!! `
`'Cause I'll come back, I'll come home!! `
`I'll definitely come home, bringing a souvenir, I promise...!!!" `
`".........I don't need one, `
`......so promise me one thing..." `
`"What? I'll promise anything...!!" `
`"......In a second, I'm going to take my hand away...... `
`It must have hurt, right......? `
`I held you so tightly... `
`I held it so tightly...... `
`......I'm okay, `
`...so you don't have to turn around... `
`...So, ...in the end, `
`...let me see the coolest part of you, `
`...Onii-chan...... `
`...Rise from your seat, `
`...point at the witch before your eyes, `
`...and announce that the game will start up again......" `
`Ange's hand...slid... `
`...and disappeared behind me. `
`There were bloody fingerprints left behind, blurred by her fingernails... `
`But I turned around right away. `
`To take care of Ange's wounds...! `
`"Angeeeeeeeee... `
`eeee...ee...... `
`............ `
`...Ange...?" `
`"Ah, crap, and you even promised that you wouldn't turn around..." `
`"...A-Ange...... `
`Nnn...wh-where..." `
`Behind my chair, `
`.........as though......about ten watermelons packed with blood... `
`had been smashed, `
`...and there was a sticky, pulpy... `
`mountain... `
`And around that mountain of blood and minced meat, `
`...the clothes and shoes Ange had been wearing... `
`lay crumpled as though they'd been taken off and thrown away... `
`...As though...just a human's insides had been pulverized and tossed there like scrap. `
`...As though Ange, who had been standing there until a second ago, had been crushed...... `
`"Ange...? `
`...Wh-Where's Ange...? `
`Where did Ange disappear to...? `
`H-Hey! `
`Where did Ange go?!" `
`The two young-looking witches said nothing... `
`...and just silently looked at the mountain of blood and meat and clothes. `
`But...I didn't want to accept it. `
`...I definitely didn't want to accept it!!! `
`".........I was right in front of you. `
`......I was watching the whole time. `
`Watching what happened......to Ange behind you." `
`"...D-Do you know...? `
`......Where...did Ange go......?" `
`".........While she still lived, `
`pinch by pinch, massive red‐hot pincers... `
`tore chunks of flesh the size of a thumb off her... `
`and threw them away. `
`......I was watching. `
`I saw as countless cruel tools, burned red-hot in the witch's furnace, approached Ange from behind, `
`and one bit at a time, ...pecked at her, twisted her, ripped chunks off her, ...and tore her to pieces." `
`"......Ange should be proud. `
`In order to share some last words with her brother, `
`...she stopped herself from gasping at that pain until the very end..." `
`......She should be proud of that." `
`...As if something like that could have happened... `
`But, ......on top of that mountain of flesh and clothes, `
`...what had fallen there... `
`...was without a doubt, what she had been wearing on her head, those pink-jeweled...hair ornaments. `
`To be honest, I'd thought they were a bit too childish for her and didn't suit her... `
`...So I remembered them well. `
`......Why did Ange wear such cheap hair ornaments all the time...? `
`No, no, `
`...the thought that this is Ange... `
`...couldn't possibly be... `
`uu, uuuuuuuuuu...! `
`".........You're pretty blunt, Beato." `
`"Battler didn't see it, `
`so you could've just said she turned into butterflies and flew away, or something." `
`"......Y‐ `
`You guys also... `
`...s-saw... `
`...that happen...? `
`Y- `
`You saw... `
`Ange... `
`get torn into little bits...? `
`You were watching, `
`......and yet, `
`...you stayed... `
`so calm the whole time......?!" `
`Without answering, Bernkastel, Lambdadelta, `
`and Beatrice stared at me, `
`...some in pity, ...others in derision, ...watching me...... `
`Since she'd called herself Gretel, `
`and after what had happened with Virgilia in the last game, ...I'd thought she might be Beato's underling, `
`and I'd been wary of her, not trusting her even though she was an ally... `
`And then, `
`......after learning that it truly was Ange, `
`...without even being allowed to see her face, `
`......I turn around... `
`and find... `
`something... `
`like this... `
`......Aaaaaaaggghhh......! `
`"Why does it matter? `
`......All this about your little sister." `
`"...What...did you say......?" `
`"After all, you'll never return from this place for all eternity anyway. `
`......Whatever happens to your little sister in a world where you don't come home has nothing to do with you. `
`As long as you play here, the Anges of countless worlds will live in isolation, `
`and the same pain of her final moments just now will be forced upon her, spread over a period of more than a decade." `
`"......However, that is of no importance, correct? `
`It cannot be "seen" by you from here. `
`You cannot observe it. `
`An unobservable fact cannot be proven except by the red truth." `
`"Therefore, your anxiety over Ange's misfortune after this may be needless. `
`......She might, surprisingly, be able to live a casual life without ever having to work thanks to Rudolf's inheritance, right? `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!" `
`...That's... `
`a lie. `
`From Ange's arm, every part of that sad future world had poured into me in an instant. `
`It's all because... `
`I keep on... `
`lazing about forever... `
`and playing in a place like this......!! `
`...I... `
`never thought about anyone but myself... `
`I must defeat her! `
`I'll take back my family, `
`back to where Ange's waiting, ...and come home as soon as I can......! `
`Because even as I hang around with the witch like this, `
`Ange's heart continues to be torn to bits by sadness...!! `
`"......Ange, is this... `
`...what you wanted to see...?" `
`......Towards the cruel witch who had indifferently spoken of Ange's brutal last moments, slowly, `
`...yet... `
`with all my might, `
`...I pointed... `
`"......Beatrice..." `
`"Indeed." `
`"......Resume this game. `
`......I won't run away anymore, ...and I won't let you escape." `
`"Bring it on. `
`I can no longer escape or hide. `
`......Let us decide this between you and me for good." `
`"......One shall win. `
`One shall lose and be destroyed. `
`No other resolution can exist." `
`"......I'll win. `
`No matter how long it takes, I'll definitely smash you...!! `
`There aren't gonna be any more compromises, interruptions or losses by default in this contest!! `
`I won't run away! `
`I won't let you get away!!" `
`"Try and defeat me with everything you've got...!! `
`There's absolutely no need for stupid tricks and deceit, for intermingling and acting friendly!! `
`You and I are enemies...!!! `
`I have to settle this as soon as possible......and bring my family back to Ange!!!" `
`...Unwavering resolve. `
`...Certain willpower. `
`The certain willpower of a Human becomes certain magical power. `
`...That leads to a miracle...and promises that it shall be so. `
`Yes, this is a promised {i:certain miracle}. `
`.........Are my chances at victory not even one in a billion...? `
`no.........is it {i:certain that there is not even a Fragment of a miracle}...{n} `
`that could make my victory happen? `
`Before I knew it, a cold, stiff chain had bound my other leg without a sound, `
`tying me to the chair... `
`......All that's left is to either be killed and lose to Battler... `
`or resist and continue in an endless tie for all eternity. `
`...Or perhaps I should say it's to continue tying until I've prepared my heart for death. `
`Either way, I... `
`......Must fight to lose, and nothing more. `
`I have already been bound by the chains of eternity. `
`And Battler won't let me escape either. `
`...Should I pathetically beg his forgiveness...? `
`Should I beg for compassion by appealing to his pitying heart...? `
`Should I forget appearances and prostrate myself? `
`Because of the chains, even that choice will not be granted me. `
`...Checkmate. `
`This is a perfect stranglehold. `
`............However. `
`I am the Golden Witch, Beatrice. `
`The demon lord of gold who reigns in the Golden Land. `
`Even in a fight to lose, there is an attitude fitting for me. `
`And I have the right to adorn my death in a manner suited to me. `
`"......I am no different. `
`I'll make you accept the existence of my magic, and the door to the Golden Land will open on this island. `
`You shall become the guest of honor at that first tea party." `
`"Everyone besides you has gathered already, you see? `
`Because the honored guest's arrival has been delayed, the tea party cannot begin." `
`"Your father, mother, cousins and everyone else are getting tired of waiting for your arrival." `
`"Sure, that's perfect, that's just perfect!! `
`What the hell is magic, what the hell are witches...?!! `
`I'm done playing with you!! `
`Here we go, Beatrice...!!!" `
`"Come as hard as you can, for there will be no compromise, interruptions or losing by default. `
`One shall win, and one shall be destroyed. `
`If you have no desire to lose, then you must defeat me, kill me. `
`However, I won't be killed so easily. `
`Until you can prepare a fitting end for me, I can resist over and over again." `
`"Can you do that? `
`...No, you probably can. `
`You surely can. `
`Come on, come and kill me. `
`......" `
`".........Is it that hard? `
`Then let's go with the usual. `
`........." `
`"Hyahhaha!! `
`As if I'd be killed! `
`Even if I can't win, I can at least harass you enough to stop you from snatching victory, riiiiiiiiiiiight?!" `
`"Hoh, that's a good look on your face! `
`...*cackle*cackle*cackle* `
`Uhhyahhahahahahaha, `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!" `
`"Try and kill me, `
`try and kill me, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeroooooooooooooooooooohhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!" `
