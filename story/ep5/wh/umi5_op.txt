`"You idiot!! `
`Isn't it obvious?!! `
`It'll be fun to kill her and see your face twist in pain, why else?!! `
`Gahyahahahahahahaha!!" `
`"Look, look, don't turn your eyes away, look at it. `
`Look, look, look! `
`It's magic, it's furniture, no matter how much you try to deny me and magic, look, look, look, look, look! `
`Gyahhahhahahaha!!" `
`"Sorry, Battleer. `
`It was pretty fun. `
`Sure, I just did what Teacher told me, but look how great it turned out! `
`Apparently, if you start out all hostile and needlessly brutal, then turn incompetent and soft at just the right moment, you can spark a huge bump on your affection meter, ri-ght? `
`Kyahahahahahaah!!" `
`That lonely tone...was the desolate sound of the wind blowing by. `
`The glittering rose petals on these bushes...were all golden. `
`The cloud of gold butterflies that had once danced through this golden rose garden like fluttering rose petals... `
`was no longer anywhere to be seen... `
`The master of the Golden Land is the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`She might be called inhumane and cruel. `
`Arrogant and outrageous. `
`Or perhaps...naive and simple. `
`That laugh of hers, which lost its grace more and more the longer it continued, ......could no longer be heard. `
`The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}... `
`sat like a doll, resting in a deck chair adorned as beautifully as the golden rose garden itself. `
`...She wasn't relaxing there. `
`Her eyes were empty. `
`She didn't respond to any questions. `
`Even so, she was not permitted to sleep. `
`{f:5:Beatrice} sat like a doll... `
`Her hair was down, and {f:5:Virgilia} was carefully tending to it with a comb. `
`The usual Beato would surely `
`have spent this time complaining about this and that regarding her hairstyle. `
`...However, she made no response, showed no reaction. `
`So it really only looked like {f:5:Virgilia} was combing the golden hair of a large doll... `
`There was a table alongside them. `
`On it sat a chessboard, ...along with a jumble of black and white pieces locked in a closely-fought battle. `
`However, this setup looked somehow different from normal chess. `
`...Maybe the game was similar, though not identical. `
`And on the other side, ...sitting back in his chair as he contemplated his next move, was a young man. `
`...No, perhaps it wasn't his next move he contemplated. `
`Every once in a while, he would change the positions of the pieces, reconsidering the situation after every change. `
`Maybe he was reconstructing previous games, trying to discover the thought process behind the moves that had been made. `
`In the past, `
`Kinzo, the Ushiromiya Family Head, once said that learning chessboard arrangements was like taking a journey through the thoughts of the old masters. `
`Ushiromiya Battler...was on a journey. `
`A search for the thought process...that had led the Golden Witch to create this arrangement and make these moves. `
`Battler took a black piece that should have been moved forward...and returned it to its original place, sighing deeply. `
`Battler's pieces were white. `
`However, on this chessboard, the black encampment was on Battler's side. `
`He was reconstructing that arrangement, trying to play Beato's role... `
`"...The more I do this, the less I understand your moves." `
`Even Battler...didn't expect that Beato would respond to that statement. `
`Or rather...he was pretending to talk to himself, `
`...thinking there might still be some chance of her responding. `
`Beato's eyes...reflected nothing. `
`And her mouth told nothing. `
`"....................." `
`After begging him to kill her, `
`...the Golden Witch had become a corpse that had given up on life. `
`She wasn't sleeping. `
`...She couldn't step down from this game and was therefore forbidden sleep. `
`So, those words must have reached her ears. `
`However, ...they probably hadn't reached her heart. `
`The Golden Witch would not sneer at Battler's moves, nor would she praise them or belittle them. `
`By now, ...{f:5:Beatrice} was nothing more than a living doll. `
`Even so, she would glance at him every once in a while. It would be an empty glance, but a glance nonetheless. `
`Sometimes, she would seem to make some sort of gesture... or even move her lips. `
`However, her movements never managed to communicate anything to Battler... `
`"How did you decide on this move in this situation? `
`...I don't get it at all. `
`I don't understand your moves." `
`".................." `
`"...Beato, `
`Battler-kun is talking to you..." `
`".................." `
`"...Say something. `
`Giggle, or guffaw, or something. `
`...Even use that shrill laugh of yours, if you want." `
`...Can you believe it...? `
`That shrill laugh of Beato's...will never be heard again. `
`However, even if she couldn't answer, his voice surely reached her. `
`...That was what Battler believed as he said these words. `
`So he said it again... `
`"How did you decide on this move in this situation? `
`I don't get it at all. `
`I don't understand your moves." `
`"............ `
`...So, you don't understand what this child is thinking?" `
`{f:5:Virgilia} answered in her disciple's stead. `
`Up to this point, she had done her best to avoid speaking for Beato. `
`After all, there was a chance that Beato would respond in some way, and {f:5:Virgilia} didn't want to be the one to steal that chance. `
`...So, Battler was going to have to bear with this silence... `
`...until Beato herself answered. `
`{f:5:Virgilia} could no longer bear to watch Battler like this... `
`Besides, Battler also wanted to hear what {f:5:Virgilia} had to say. `
`He believed that conversation would reach Beato's heart... `
`"Yep. `
`I don't have a clue. `
`...The more I try standing in Beato's shoes and moving the pieces like this, the less I understand." `
`A serial murder following an epitaph. `
`With that as a victory condition, I tried reconstructing the games from the witch's side, `
`...but I never ended up making the moves Beato did. `
`In those games, I could find several incomprehensible moves that clearly worked against that victory condition... `
`"...I don't get it at all. `
`This journey through her thoughts is just too rugged." `
`"Even so, you won't give up, will you?" `
`"I won't. `
`......I promised." `
`{a:c: `
`Kill...me. `
`......Let me die......} `
`"I promised to let her die peacefully. `
`......And I'm the only one who can do it." `
`...Beato's right ankle was bound with a heavy, cold, steel shackle. `
`It wasn't tied to anything, so it didn't restrict her movement. `
`However, it symbolized restriction. `
`It was a visualization of the bonds...that prevented her from leaving the game until she either won or lost... `
`And, ...the shackle was probably hurting her. `
`The mercilessly cold shackle... `
`tormented her over and over inside her waking dream. `
`".........Ghh.........ah..." `
`So, there was never any sign of relief in her empty expression. `
`Her eyelids would sometimes tremble like she was having a nightmare, ...and every once in a while, she would let out a pained gasp. `
`Unless I win, `
`...Beato will never be released from the curse that prevents her from sleeping peacefully... `
`"...Are you sure you want to be doing this? `
`It seems the 5th game has already started." `
`"............ `
`...Not interested." `
`Why should I take part in any game unless Beato is my opponent...? `
`If that's the only alternative, `
`then it's a much better use of my time to reconstruct previous games while taking a journey in search of Beato's thought process... `
`"I'll be the next Game Master. `
`Any objections? `
`You've got none, right?" `
`"...I've got nothing but objections. `
`Beato conceded the fight and is unconscious. `
`Isn't this a loss by default and "game over" for her...?" `
`"I'll admit a lot's happened to Beato, and she's basically been KO'ed for now. `
`But that doesn't mean she's lost the will to fight. `
`That's why I'm acting as her assistant. `
`Get it?" `
`Beato was lying down on a deck chair, almost as though she was sleeping. `
`However, she wasn't sleeping, `
`...and she wasn't awake either. `
`She was nothing more than a living doll that had given up on victory, who had asked Battler to perform her last rites, `
`and who had surrendered everything... `
`Of course, if everyone just sat around, the next game...the 5th game would never be made ready. `
`So, {f:5:Lambdadelta} had succeeded Beato as the next Game Master `
`and announced that she'd prepare the next game. `
`"Quit messing around. `
`This is a game between me and Beato. `
`I don't know who you two are, but I'm not gonna let you carry on without us." `
`"No one asked for your opinion. `
`What'll you do, Bern? `
`Accept my challenge? Or not?" `
`"............ `
`...Sure. `
`Go ahead and inherit her role." `
`"The hell... Quit messing around! `
`I don't know who you people are, but I'm not gonna let you ignore Beato and me and just carry on by yourselves!" `
`"Hey, take it easy. `
`Okay, sure, a new player means you'll face new kinds of moves. `
`I'm sure you'll see a lot of stuff that confuses you, `
`but even that might lead to some big hints, get it?" `
`"Who cares!! `
`Quit saying whatever you want and deciding everything on your own!!" `
`"......Beato's game has repeated four times, and you still don't understand anything, right? `
`In that case, I expect that swapping out opponents might lead to some huge hints." `
`"That's none of your business! `
`This is our game! Beato prepared it, and she designated me to be her opponent. `
`I don't know what hole you two crept out of, but I don't want you screwing things up!" `
`"......In that case, wake Beato up and make her get the next game ready. `
`Can you...?" `
`"...B-Beato won't be getting up for a while. `
`Anyway, we don't even need to have another game. `
`The four games she's already laid out are more than enough!" `
`"And even if we do have some fifth game, there's no reason it shouldn't just be a puzzle Beato lays out and I take on. `
`There's absolutely no reason for you two to butt in!" `
`Battler couldn't hide his irritation at the two witches called {f:5:Lambdadelta} and {f:5:Bernkastel}, `
`who had shown up well after the game's start, and who were now trying to take charge on their own... `
`It looked like these witches were of an even higher rank than Beato... `
`So high, in fact, that even Beato's teacher, {f:5:Virgilia}, couldn't even come close. `
`Battler had the feeling he'd seen these two several times before. `
`However, this was the first time he'd known their names and spoken to them directly. `
`"You can't get the next game ready without waking Beato. `
`That's why I'll prepare the next game!" `
`"We aren't so patient `
`that we're willing to wait forever for Beato to regain consciousness. `
`Right, Bern?" `
`"......I don't like boredom. `
`It really ticks me off." `
`"We really don't give a damn whether you're bored or not." `
`"Come on now. `
`Leave everything to this <perfect> {f:5:Lambdadelta}-sama, okay? `
`I'll take over as the Game Master. `
`{f:5:Don't worry}, I won't play with too much "absolute perfection". `
`{i:Just like Beato}, I'll set up plenty of incomprehensible fakes, clues, and bonus hints. `
`I'll make this game a huge hint that'll help you understand Beato's world even better, okay?" `
`Letting my voiceless emotions explode, ...I slammed the table hard. `
`The two witches didn't flinch at all. `
`...One grinned. `
`The other looked indifferent, as though nothing had happened. `
`The two of them just stared at me silently. `
`...As though they were reproaching me. `
`"What's this? `
`Not satisfied? `
`Are you saying you'll step down from my 5th game? `
`Isn't that a loss by default?" `
`"......Battler won't step down. `
`Of course he'll participate in the 5th game." `
`"Don't just decide that yourself!! `
`I'm not gonna play along with you two. `
`I don't give a shit!" `
`"Hmmm... `
`...Then it really is a loss by default, right...? `
`The witch side wins this game. `
`Is it really okay to end this with the Humans surrendering...?" `
`"......If you step down, the game will end with your loss by default, get it? `
`......If you wanna guarantee that your lonely sister always meets with miserable circumstances in an endless number of worlds, `
`that option is indeed open to you." `
`When {f:5:Bernkastel} mentioned Ange, ......Battler's expression changed instantly. `
`"...Y-You bastard, `
`don't you dare talk about Ange so lightly..." `
`"......Because you have an ally in me, {f:5:Bernkastel}, the Witch of Miracles, `
`...there exists the possibility of a miracle in which Ange's family comes home to her. `
`Well, if you do throw that chance away and guarantee that Ange's endless futures all end in sorrow, that might be pretty interesting too." `
`I vaguely understood what she was saying. `
`Until I win in Beato's game, I'll remain trapped in this bizarre world. `
`And if I abandon that victory, ...then most certainly, my parents and I will never return to Ange. `
`For Ange's sake, ...even though I know that the witches are toying with me, `
`I must keep on fighting... `
`"Nng, ......d-dammit......" `
`"......What's wrong? `
`You look unsatisfied. `
`Have you already forgotten how angry you were...when your sister was turned to mincemeat...? `
`You know, that spectacle where she was torn to bits, ripped to pieces by countless red-hot pliers. `
`You'd better watch more closely next time, okay...?" `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} pointed the palm of her right hand upwards. `
`...As she did, a pale light gathered there, ......and some kind of blue-glowing crystal appeared there. `
`...A scene was reflected on its sharp surface, `
`...but it wasn't the scene that surrounded them now. `
`If you looked deep into that crystal, ...that Fragment, `
`then you would probably learn what was reflected on there. `
`If you stared at it, `
`then you'd surely see the end Ange finally reached......after waiting 12 years and giving up everything for the sake of her beloved brother. `
`......The scene of her death throes...as her entire body was torn to bits while she still lived. `
`"...D-Damn...you......!" `
`Without thinking, he grabbed at her collar, `
`but as soon as he touched that which made up her form, it disappeared like foam on the waves. `
`Then, as naturally as though she'd been there from the beginning, `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} was leaning against a distant wall. `
`"......If you step down from the game, `
`this'll become not just a Fragment, but a definite reality. `
`I won't be the one to create that future. `
`You'll do it yourself. `
`...So decide, okay? `
`Figure out what you wanna do with your beloved little sister's future." `
`Battler's fists shook with anger, `
`...but even if he swung them down, he wouldn't be able to hit {f:5:Bernkastel}. `
`This witch was like a phantom, or a cat who wouldn't even let someone pet her if she didn't wish for it. `
`And, ...she was telling the truth. `
`For Ange's sake, I can't step down from this fight. `
`Even if these unpleasant witches hijack the game board. `
`"Heheheheheh. `
`That's just like you, Bern. `
`You're even heartless when you threaten people. `
`...That's how it is, Battleeer. `
`You aren't allowed to step down from the game board. `
`You and Beato are nothing more than pieces on the board that exist to distract us from our boredom. `
`...Even your incomprehensible anger and irritation make for a wonderful treat to satisfy us." `
`"Well, what you're doing now only makes for a cheap snack though." `
`"......Like those curry-flavored potato wafers that sell for 30 yen a pair." `
`""*giggle*giggle*, ahhahahahahahaha...!!"" `
`"Y-You damn...witches..." `
`"......*giggle* `
`Fight for Ange's sake, okay? `
`And for Beato's too, right...?" `
`In a way that was admonishing...or perhaps babying, `
`...like the headache you get after eating something too sweet, {f:5:Bernkastel} tormented Battler and smiled. `
`By now, the host of this tea party, Beato, was absent. `
`...The guest witches were already making themselves at home. `
`"...What'll you do, Ushiromiya Battleer? `
`Will you surrender to fate...?" `
`".................." `
`"Just step down. `
`You've had enough of being toyed with as a witch's piece, right? `
`Heheheheh, it sure is tough being one of Bern's pieces. `
`I'm sure she'll use you and throw you away just like she did with Ange. `
`Geheheheheh!" `
`"I'm not giving you the option of stepping down. `
`...Keep fighting for the sake of your sister's future. `
`I'm your ally. `
`Until you win, I'll support you so you can reach that future. `
`For all eternity, until I get bored. `
`...*giggle*giggle*." `
`I can't let her provocation and cajolery rile me up... `
`These witches know I get mad easily, and they're trying to take advantage of that... `
`...Battler withstood it all...and finally relaxed his clenched fists. `
`"......If you wanna start this 5th game of yours, ...go ahead and do it. `
`Do whatever you want." `
`"Yes, I will do whatever I want. `
`...Hey, where are you going?" `
`Even though Battler acknowledged this 5th game, he turned his back on them, `
`much to {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s surprise. `
`"If you're gonna be Beato's substitute, `
`...then I'm sure that {f:5:Bernkastel} witch over there can stand in for me if she wants." `
`"......Not a bad idea. `
`Better than a loss by default." `
`"What the heck?! `
`Are you gonna just ignore this Episode 5 that I put so much effort into making?! `
`Rude, ruuude!" `
`"...Battler says he's going to take a break for a while. `
`Until he comes back, I'll be his substitute. `
`How's that sound...? Battler...?" `
`"......You do that." `
`"............" `
`"...What's wrong, Lambda? `
`So, you'll refuse to play if it's against me, instead of that fool Battler...?" `
`"Ehheheheheh!! `
`Of course not{p:0:♪} `
`I'm glad I get to play with you, Bern! `
`Come on, let's play, let's play! `
`Let's play together in {f:5:Lambdadelta}-sama's super <hyper> and <cute> Episode 5!" `
`"......This technically is a world Beato created. `
`You aren't going to ruin the atmosphere of the story, are you...?" `
`"Don't worry about that. `
`I'm really good at reading between the lines for that sort of stuff. `
`I made sure to use a Beato-ish atmosphere to make a tale that's even more interesting." `
`"Battler, make sure you come back as soon as your break's over, okay? `
`It'd be a shame to miss this. `
`I've set up plenty of bonus hints that'll get you closer to Beato's secrets{p:0:♪}" `
`"...Or at least that's what it'll look like, when it's actually filled with misdirection that makes stuff more and more confusing. `
`Wait, hey, Battleer! Why aren't you listening when a witch is talking?!" `
`Without answering, Battler disappeared into the darkness. `
`After shrugging and cackling, `
`the witches immediately started playing with the game board they had stolen from Beato...... `
`"Can those witches really understand Beato's game?" `
`"...Since they're using the same game board, they cannot do anything that this child cannot do. `
`However, they can do things that this child wouldn't do." `
`"......... `
`...What do you mean, things she wouldn't do?" `
`"The materials of chess exist so that you can play chess. `
`You "cannot" use them to play cards. `
`However, when it comes to throwing chess pieces at your opponent and scribbling on the board, `
`...such things are not impossible to do. `
`However, that would be blasphemy against the game of chess, `
`so people "choose not to" do that." `
`".................." `
`That definitely...wouldn't be chess anymore. `
`Beato's eyes seemed to cloud slightly with sadness. `
`"......Damn them. `
`......This game's between me and Beato. `
`...I won't let anyone else defile it." `
`At that time, gold butterflies gathered and Ronove appeared, holding a tea set with black tea. `
`"Would you like some more tea?" `
`"......If you wouldn't mind." `
`"Certainly. `
`...So, `
`how goes this journey of yours in search of Milady's thoughts?" `
`"I don't have a clue, but I'm enjoying it." `
`"However, ...are you sure about this? `
`Is it truly all right for you to relax here?" `
`"...You mean that game those witches just started all by themselves?" `
`"Indeed. `
`Just now, when I went to serve them some tea, the murders of the first twilight had already taken place, `
`and it seemed as though the next murder would occur shortly." `
`When Beato and I were playing, `
`the game would be paused whenever someone left their seats. `
`...However, those witches wouldn't pause that game just because I wasn't around... `
`".........Ronove, did you see their game?" `
`"Just a part of it." `
`"How was it?" `
`Ronove lifted the pot high with an elegant gesture as he poured the black tea. `
`After finishing that, he finally spoke. `
`He gave us his impressions of it. `
`"It...did not have love." `
`"...What do you mean, love?" `
`"My apologies. `
`That is how a woman might put it. `
`...As a man, `
`...one might call it dishonorable." `
`I understood what those words meant. `
`When I met {f:5:Virgilia}'s eyes, she shook her head slightly and stared at the floor... `
`"......I believe it resembles Milady's games greatly, on the surface. `
`However, its foundation is quite different." `
`"Does it go against the rules of Beato's game?" `
`"No, it does not. `
`{f:5:Lambdadelta}-sama actually does understand the rules of Milady's game very well. `
`...However..." `
`"..............." `
`Battler stood up. `
`There was no need to make Ronove say any more. `
`"Battler-kun..." `
`"...Sorry, Ronove. `
`I know you went to all the trouble of pouring this for me, but tea isn't what I need." `
`"So, you will go after all?" `
`"Yeah. `
`...We don't need any outsiders in our game." `
`...These guys weren't even here in the beginning. `
`Because I've been loafing about, crazier and crazier witches have been introduced, `
`...and now they've hijacked this game between me and {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`"I've gotta take it back. `
`...Right now, I'm supposed to be the one taking care of Beato's game board. `
`...That means I can't just sit around here." `
`"......Thank you. `
`I wanted to let this child hear those words." `
`"I'm sure she hears them. `
`......Milady is simply unable to answer." `
`Beato lay there silently, like a living doll with dull eyes... `
`The game board she had created herself had been hijacked by incomprehensible people... and was being turned into a mess... `
`If I was designated to be her opponent... `
`...Then Beato must have created this game for me. `
`I've...got to take it back. `
`"...Wait here. `
`I'll go and take it back." `
`"....................." `
`Of course, Beato didn't respond in any way. `
`...That's right. `
`If she can't respond, ...then I have to protect it in her place. `
`"I'll be right back. `
`......{f:5:Virgilia}, Ronove. `
`...I'm counting on you two to look after this golden sleeping beauty." `
`"Yes. Leave it to us." `
`"...See you later, Battler-kun. `
`And please, `
`...in the game without this child, try to find some part of her. `
`If you can, `
`...then even if this child is absent, it will mean you have fought with her." `
`"......You're right. `
`...Aaah, `
`...it's all useless. `
`What am I doing?" `
`Let's go. `
`...And let's take it back. `
`"Sorry to keep you waiting, witches!! `
`My break is over!!" `
`When he faced the jet-black heavens and yelled this, `
`the whole world shattered, as though it were made out of thin glass. `
`Then, ...as though it had been that way since the beginning, `
`......it transformed into that smoking room where Battler had fought Beato so many times, ...and which the two witches had now hijacked. `
`"What do you think you're doing? `
`You're only coming back now? `
`It's way too late! `
`Not only has the game reached the second day, it's already at the finale, get it?!" `
`"......You never showed up, so I just advanced things on my own." `
`Yeah, like you even waited for me in the first place... `
`"Bern was waaay more skillful and thrilling than you were. Right?!" `
`"Shut up. `
`I'm the player. `
`You substitute witches can just take a step back now." `
`"......Well, I don't really mind if you join in starting now, but there's probably no need for you anymore." `
`"Seriously. `
`After all, we're already at the climax! `
`After this, Bern will probably corner me and win." `
`"What the hell......?!" `
`"......Nothing wrong with that, is there? `
`Why don't we let him watch the final endgame?" `
`"Of course. `
`Come on over, Ushiromiya Battler. `
`It's almost completely over, but here's the <cute> and <elegant> game I made! `
`Episode 5. `
`End of the `
`Golden Witch! `
`Right now, no humans exist on this island except for those in this parlor. `
`And, with one exception, it has been shown that none of them have committed murder. `
`And, the culprit is among these people. `
`"......Whoa, whoa. `
`...That means...it's conclusive, isn't it...?" `
`"Unless the culprit is a witch who committed murder with magic, that is..." `
`"...It was you?! `
`You killed George, killed my husband?! `
`Why?!! `
`Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?!!" `
`"...I-I didn't kill anyone...! `
`I-I...d-didn't...!!" `
`"..............." `
`In a panic, and with a voice that was far from calm, `
`......in a manner that was, to put it coldly, unsightly, ...Aunt Natsuhi denied the suspicion placed upon her... `
`However, ......there was no longer any way around it... `
`{i:She} stood up, ...brushed back her long hair, pointed at Aunt Natsuhi, and said it one more time. `
`"...You're the culprit, `
`Ushiromiya Natsuhi-san." `
