`The rose garden was truly splendid this year. `
`The roses were blooming like crazy, as if competing with each other. `
`In that rose garden, Kinzo, Kanon, and Natsuhi could be seen... `
`"Once again, the flowers have grown wonderfully this year. `
`It must be the result of your care." `
`"......Thank you very much. `
`The weather just happened to be good this year." `
`"Thanks to your care, the garden is even more beautiful than usual. `
`Good work." `
`"Thank you very much..." `
`"If today weren't so special, `
`...we might have been able to admire the roses while enjoying some black tea." `
`Kinzo shrugged. `
`Today was the family conference. `
`...When it came to the other siblings' businesses, none of the news had been good. `
`On the contrary, those siblings probably planned to turn the conversation to the topic of Kinzo's remaining life... `
`and hold a quiet feud over the inheritance. `
`"...Those people are quite unpleasant. `
`By the way, what about Krauss? `
`Is that debt repayment plan of his proceeding well?" `
`"It does seem to be a realistic plan. `
`......However, it's a plan on quite a large scale, and it doesn't seem to be bearing fruit quite as well as he expected." `
`"If possible, I would have hoped to have that resolved before today's family conference." `
`"...Yes. `
`My apologies." `
`"Are you sure you're okay, Kinzo? `
`Casually walking around in a place like that?" `
`How had she gotten up there? `
`...Well, it's fairly pointless to wonder about that sort of thing when you're dealing with a witch. `
`{f:5:Beatrice} was casually sitting on the roof of the arbor, `
`almost as though she had been basking in the sun. `
`"Those relatives are like a massive lump of the magic-resisting toxin, and they'll be intruding in on us. `
`If you bump into them, your soul will evaporate in a instant." `
`"Hmph. `
`I am already dead. `
`Evaporating would be no detriment." `
`"...We can't have that happen. `
`Please, for the sake of the Ushiromiya family, lend us your strength just a little longer." `
`"Natsuhi, `
`it seems the boat carrying the relatives has left the harbor. `
`Perhaps it's about time to bring an end to this walk of yours." `
`"...Is that so? `
`Thank you. `
`...Please return to the study, Father." `
`"My, my... `
`How tiresome, to go back inside when the weather is this perfect." `
`"Don't grumble, Kinzo. `
`Right now, you're nothing more than a ghost I gave life to. `
`It'll be troublesome for both me and Natsuhi if you're scattered away by the toxin. `
`Just be a good boy, shut yourself away in the study, and wrap a blanket around yourself or something. `
`*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"Hmph. `
`...Merely receiving the chance to enjoy these roses after death makes me an extremely fortunate man. `
`I understand. `
`I shall return to the study." `
`"But I would like some black tea. `
`Kanon, tell Genji to bring me some. `
`Perhaps some Marco Polo would do well today." `
`"...Certainly." `
`"Then let us go our separate ways. `
`Natsuhi, `
`...you must conduct the family conference splendidly in my absence." `
`"Of course, Father. `
`He can't say it in front of them, but my husband is already the Ushiromiya Family Head. `
`And, I will do all I can to ensure that I don't embarrass him as his wife." `
`"...Compared to Krauss, who's had a stomachache since this morning, you are so very composed, Natsuhi. `
`...My son is quite hopeless." `
`"My husband is talented in his own way. `
`Supporting him where he's weak is my duty as his wife." `
`"Indeed. `
`Carry out your task with precision. `
`I will make sure to stay shut away, so that I don't get in the way of this farce." `
`"Kanon, `
`go with Father to the study. `
`And then have Genji prepare some black tea." `
`"I'm not so senile that I need your help to stand up. `
`Here I go..." `
`Refusing Kanon's attempt to lend him a hand, Kinzo rose from the flower bed he had been sitting on. `
`The retired Head left everything in Natsuhi's hands and returned to the study at a gentle pace... `
`"...You're looking well. `
`You possess a sense of dignity reminiscent of Kinzo's deceased wife." `
`"On the off-chance that the magic-resisting toxin does reach Father, `
`...will the magic dissolve in an instant?" `
`"Indeed. `
`In the blink of an eye. `
`...I can vanish whenever I please, `
`but if someone already dead such as Kinzo loses his form, he'll be instantly tossed away like dust by the winds of the sun. `
`You must take care." `
`"Yes. `
`I understand." `
`"......You may have talent as a witch. `
`The magic-resisting toxin has been building up in your system over the years, `
`and yet you are still able to understand magic. `
`...If you and I had met during your youth, you might have become a powerful witch by now." `
`"I am the wife of Ushiromiya Krauss, the Family Head. `
`I would become even a witch or a demon to protect his honor. `
`...I am deeply grateful for the power of your magic. `
`I wouldn't have been able to protect the honor of the Ushiromiya family without you." `
`"Let's discuss that at another time. `
`I'd like to enjoy it with just the two of us women drinking tea." `
`"A friend of mine who went to Sri Lanka sent me some black tea with a wonderful rose fragrance." `
`"Hoh, you mean Dimbula. `
`That isn't bad. `
`Then you should also have some patis on the side. `
`...You must serve me some as a reward if I manage to trick everyone for this entire family conference. `
`It's a promise." `
`"Understood. `
`I promise. `
`Then, I'll see you later." `
`"Yes, later." `
`The witch made her body crumble into the rustling winds, became gold flower petals, and scattered into thin air. `
`Natsuhi watched her go, then turned on her heels and headed for the mansion. `
`And then there were none left in the rose garden... `
`"Oookay then. `
`It's <break time>. `
`Got any complaints so far?" `
`"......None at all. `
`If you have to pee, why not just go and do it...?" `
`"What a rude thing to say. `
`{p:1:Kinzo is already dead}, right? `
`But he's walking around and talking, isn't he? `
`Doesn't that mean this is magic?!" `
`"Of course, I doubt this move would work on you after all this time, Bern. `
`...But what about you, Battler? `
`Isn't this weird? `
`Don't you have to accept the existence of the magic that revived Kinzo? `
`Hahhihhyahhahaaaah!" `
`"...If you're trying to imitate Beato, `
`it's pissing me off, so stop it right now." `
`"*giggle*! `
`Figured it out?! `
`Then come on, how are you gonna answer, Battler? `
`Kinzo was just out for a stroll. `
`Why not act like you always do and start holding your head, crying "THIS MAKES NO SENSE!!"...? `
`C'mon, use that old "IT'S ALL USELESS" catch phrase, and then gimme one of your classic nonsensical counterarguments." `
`"There's no way a human who's supposed to be dead could be walking around, right? `
`Is this all because of some unknown virus called the Rokkenjima Syndrome that causes mass delusions? `
`Or do the scales of a mysterious form of butterfly that only lives on Rokkenjima happen to be hallucinogenic?! `
`Or is it all because a mysterious secret organization called the Mountain Dogs made an as-of-yet undiscovered drug called Purupuru Pikopuyo which causes mass delusions?!! `
`Let me hear tons of this wonderful crap, `
`kyaaahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!" `
`"......Just shut up. `
`This isn't even a problem." `
`{p:1:Grandfather is dead at this point in time}. `
`There's no way he exists. `
`"The only reason he's able to act like he's alive like this... `
`is because of Aunt Natsuhi's lie, her attempt to make it through the family conference while hiding Grandfather's death." `
`"Oh? `
`It's Natsuhi's lie?! `
`You can revive the dead by lying? `
`Wouldn't that make it Natsuhi's magic?" `
`"This world is like a Braun tube before you've looked in it. `
`...It's the world of the cat box before you open it. `
`As long as Aunt Natsuhi says she took a walk with Grandfather, and as long as no one can confirm that it's a lie, `
`it's possible to display "Aunt Natsuhi taking a walk in the rose garden with Grandfather" as Natsuhi's reality. `
`That means it's possible for Grandfather to appear." `
`*clap*, *clap*, *clap*... `
`That extremely unflattering applause was coming from {f:5:Bernkastel}. `
`"...Bravo. `
`.........You're much calmer without Beato around." `
`"Quiet. `
`You shut up too." `
`"Wait a second, Battler. `
`According to your theory, sure, it might really be possible for Kinzo to appear if Natsuhi's the only person there. `
`If Natsuhi claims to have observed Kinzo in a world with no one except Natsuhi in it, then no one can deny it, right?" `
`"But Kanon was in the same place, and he was also looking at Kinzo, right? `
`How would you explain that?" `
`"...That's no problem at all. `
`Kanon-kun is a servant who works for the Ushiromiya family. `
`...Aunt Natsuhi probably ordered him to keep to her story, so that she could hide Grandfather's death. `
`...Because of that, Kanon can see Grandfather even though he shouldn't exist, just like Aunt Natsuhi can." `
`".........Too bad, Lambda. `
`Battler isn't gonna fall for that kind of child's play anymore." `
`"Seems so. `
`...Well, this is nothing more than an opening, before the game's really started. `
`Like an aperitif before a meal." `
`"......An appetizer at a bar. `
`Green tea at a sushi restaurant." `
`"Shut up. `
`So, we aren't gonna get anywhere unless I say it again in blue text, huh?" `
`"Looks like it. `
`Would you mind?" `
`"......... `
`...... `
`{p:2:The reason Grandfather is strolling around like nothing happened even though he's already dead... `
`is that people who want to make it seem as though he's alive created an illusion of him. `
`People who think the same way can share in that illusion. `
`Then, they'll talk as though Grandfather actually exists and was with them until a second ago. `
`That's why he's strolling around like it's perfectly natural.}" `
`" `
`"{p:2:Because of this, the illusion of Grandfather is unable to appear in front of people who aren't in on this with Aunt Natsuhi.} `
`{p:2:That's why they made up the story of him shutting himself away in his study and refusing to come out.}" `
`In the games before now, Grandfather has always locked himself up in his study. `
`We never met him directly. `
`However, some people said things that made us think he was locked up in his study in a bad mood, `
`such as claiming to have met him only a short while ago. `
`We blindly accepted their statements and believed that Grandfather was in the study. `
`{a:c: `
`{i:That's why it was possible for an illusion of Grandfather to exist in the study}.} `
`That's right, in the games before now, `
`the only people who met Grandfather were Uncle Krauss, Aunt Natsuhi, `
`and the servants. `
`{p:2:Because they all stuck to the same story, `
`an illusion of Grandfather was able to exist on this island, making it seem like he was alive}. `
`"...You even showed us a scene at the beginning of this game, `
`where Aunt Natsuhi convinced Doctor Nanjo and the rest to cover up Grandfather's death. `
`...I'm not gonna fall for a cheap trick like that after all this time." `
`"......Well, not bad. `
`But I was hoping for the unknown drug Purupuru Pikopuyo." `
`"There's no way he'd say something so ridiculous, right...? `
`After all, supposing that such a thing exists would be just as bad as surrendering to the fantasy genre. `
`...Whether it's a virus or a drug or an illness, anything that hasn't been discovered yet is in violation of Knox's 4th commandment." `
`"...What do you mean, 4th commandment?" `
`"Knox's 4th. `
`It is forbidden for unknown drugs or difficult to understand scientific devices to be used. `
`......The rule states that such things can't be used during a murder." `
`"What the hell... `
`Unknown drug X and unknown scientific device X should be the best kinds of weapons to use when fighting against a witch..." `
`"......That's what I'm talking about. `
`All of those violate the rules of a proper mystery. `
`Supposing an unknown virus, `
`an unknown drug, `
`...an unknown sickness, or an unknown XXX was used puts it totally in the fantasy genre. `
`My condolences. `
`If that was your theory, then it's "game over" for you. `
`*giggle*giggle*." `
`"......H-Hey... `
`What are you talking about...?" `
`"You think you've been fighting in direct opposition to Beato. `
`But that's not actually true. `
`You haven't been in direct opposition. `
`You've been fighting along with her from a slightly different angle." `
`"All this playing detective you've done hasn't been fantasy vs mystery. `
`It's only been fantasy vs anti-fantasy." `
`"...I don't have a clue what you're talking about. `
`...But there's one thing I do get. `
`......It sounds like you're saying there's something wrong with my fighting style." `
`"......We're fighting to kill the fantasy known as the Illusion of the Witch. `
`That means interpreting this tale `
`as a {i:proper mystery}. `
`In other words, from the very start, we have to ignore any and all elements that violate the taboos of the mystery genre." `
`"I-Ignore, you say......?" `
`"For example, several closed room murders have occurred in the games before now, right?" `
`"...Y-Yeah." `
`At every single crime scene, `
`you enthusiastically check with Beato to make sure there are no hidden doors, right? `
`Then that leads to a flashy bunch of red truths weaving together all over the place, `
`almost as though that itself is the battle. `
`I call that a waste of time. `
`After all, it's clearly specified in Knox's 3rd. `
`"It is forbidden for hidden passages to exist." `
`In the mystery genre, hidden passages {i:mustn't exist}. `
`So, if you wanna interpret everything as a proper mystery, `
`entering this whole debate over whether there are hidden doors or not means you've lost from the beginning, see...? `
`After all, {i:there aren't any}. `
`As soon as you suspect that they might exist, it's already "game over" for you. `
`In other words, you assume you can't start theory-building, just because no one's yet proven that hidden doors don't exist at the crime scene. `
`That's why I call you naive and a failure at the mystery genre. `
`You've already lost once you start thinking that. `
`You thought you were waging a fight to interpret everything like a mystery novel, right...? `
`Then you've got to follow the conventions of the mystery genre. `
`...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*, hihihihihihihihihihihihyahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!! `
`"*cough* `
`......Well, that's it in a nutshell. `
`Hidden doors must not exist at any of the crime scenes. `
`That means any time spent asking whether they exist or not is wasted." `
`"...I think I know what you're talking about. `
`I've heard about it somewhere. `
`Is this like the ten basic rules for mystery novels or something?" `
`"Yeah, that's right. `
`They're the ten wedges for drilling witches brandished by Knox, the peerless archbishop of witch hunting. `
`Those are the true weapons with which to fight and defeat the fantasy known as the Illusion of the Witch head on. `
`...It's just like you, Bern, `
`to bring in such a troublesome weapon. `
`That's the fantasy genre's archenemy." `
`"............ `
`So, you'll deny the existence of hidden doors right from the start, without even investigating the crime scene... `
`That sounds more like fantasy to me..." `
`"Lambda, who's in charge of the witch's side, is fantasy. `
`I'm the one who's fighting her, mystery. `
`What are you? `
`You're just barely anti-fantasy, doing nothing but dodging over and over and denying fantasy. `
`You're opposed to absolutely everything, but you can't make any counter-proposals. `
`You're like a politician from some country. `
`*giggle*giggle*." `
`"Shut up. `
`I didn't come here to speak gibberish with you two. `
`Continue the story right now...!!" `
`"...Be quiet. `
`That sleeping princess behind you looks like she's in pain, doesn't she?" `
`When he turned around, he saw Beato's living corpse resting in a chair... `
`However, sweat glistened all over her body, and it felt like she was breathing a little harder than normal. `
`...She looked as though she was suffering from a high fever. `
`"Beato, `
`...what's wrong, ...are you okay...?" `
`"What do you mean, is she okay? `
`You sure do say some weird things. `
`...Aren't you fighting to kill this girl?" `
`"..............." `
`"We've rewound this 5th game for your benefit, `
`but right now, Bern has done a good job cornering her opponent and is about to break through the Illusion of the Witch. `
`...Her existence has been almost completely denied. `
`It's only natural that she's suffering." `
`"......Just now, `
`even you smashed the Illusion of the Witch by saying there's no way Kinzo exists. `
`......Here's the proof that your attack reached Beato. `
`This agony of hers." `
`"..............." `
`...I tried to at least wipe away the sweat on Beato's forehead with a handkerchief. `
`It's true I promised Beato that I'd let her die. `
`But it was supposed to happen...peacefully. `
`I wasn't planning to make her suffer first. `
`...My goal isn't to make the sleeping Beato suffer like this before killing her... `
`As if they had seen right through to my mixed feelings, `
`the two witches grinned... `
`"Dad only overheard because you kept yelling about the inheritance, right, Aneki?" `
`"It isn't my fault, it was just an unlucky coincidence, okay?! `
`He just happened to be in the corridor and heard... It was an accident, I tell you, an accident...!" `
`"Could you two give it a rest...? `
`Just call it our bad luck this time and give it up. `
`If you leave a man alone, his mood'll pop right back to normal." `
`"Hopefully Father's feelings weren't hurt so much that he writes up some strange will." `
`The relatives took a deep breath and fell silent... `
`"Hey! You can't jump around either, Maria! `
`What'll you do if Ange-chan falls?!" `
`"......Sorry to keep you waiting. `
`The boat is ready." `
`"Okay, let's go. `
`Won't get anywhere by complainin' now." `
`"We eagerly await your return to this island." `
`Natsuhi was sitting on a bench in the rose garden, looking completely worn out. `
`However, when she noticed that Kanon and Kumasawa were coming back, she immediately sat up straight, regaining the dignity of the Head's wife. `
`"...Did the boat leave?" `
`"Yes. `
`It departed just a minute ago." `
`"I see. `
`Good job seeing them off. `
`...What is my husband doing?" `
`"He returned to his room a short while ago. `
`He is resting." `
`Since the previous day, Krauss had been almost overwhelmed by anxiety over the thought that Kinzo's death might be discovered. `
`When the family conference ended, his weariness must have suddenly gotten ahold of him. `
`...However, the way he had refused to let even a sliver of his true intentions slip out... `
`and the manner in which he had managed to act as though everything was normal...showed that Krauss's nerve was nothing to sneeze at. `
`"......How was it? `
`Did they seem to notice anything suspicious about Father...?" `
`"Not at all. `
`Eva-sama and the rest were having a big ruckus over how the Master overheard them talking about the inheritance. Right? `
`Wasn't their panicking just priceless?" `
`"Yes. `
`They were quite shaken up." `
`"But Kumasawa, you really are quite an actress. `
`The way you acted all panicked in the corridor made it seem like Father really was there." `
`"......Kumasawa-san is quite talented at that sort of thing." `
`"Oooh, come now, I don't deserve such praise. `
`Hohohohoh." `
`"*giggle* `
`I always have to give Genji strict orders not to easily swallow your stories when you call in sick." `
`"Now that's just too harsh, Madam. `
`Ohohohohoh..." `
`"You really did a good job. `
`Both of you, as well as Genji and Shannon, `
`will get your pay for a month's worth of past vacation time, as well as five extra days, just as promised. `
`Consider this is a confidential benefit. `
`Talk with Genji when you collect your pay so that the other servants don't find out." `
`"Sure, we understand. `
`Right?" `
`"......Kumasawa-san, `
`your voice is too loud." `
`"Ooh, not good, not good, ...hohohoh." `
`"Good point. `
`Let's leave it at that for the time being. `
`We should all return to our regular duties. `
`That's right, I've had Gohda prepare some special tea. `
`Tell him to serve it." `
`Natsuhi let them know she wanted to be left alone for a while, `
`so she could drink some black tea in the rose garden. `
`The black tea that had been carried all the way to the bench... `
`was the Sri Lankan tea "Dimbula" that she had promised Beato, along with some patis... `
`Sitting on either side of this snack, staring at it curiously, the wife of the Head and her witch could be seen. `
`"...So this is patis... `
`I just assumed it would be some kind of baked sweet..." `
`Apparently Natsuhi, not realizing that it had a curry-like spicy flavor, had started choking after putting it in her mouth. `
`To describe it in Japanese terms, it was like fried dumplings stuffed with mashed, curry-flavored potatoes. `
`As a household dish, it would probably be pretty popular with the kids. `
`However, it was something of a shock to Natsuhi, who expected that a treat to go with tea would be sweet. `
`"Didn't you know? `
`Dimbula always goes with this. `
`Black tea always goes with cookies. `
`Oh, but chocolate is good too. `
`You must have sweet bean jelly with Japanese tea, although salted konbu also works. `
`Chinese tea goes with Chinese dumplings. `
`Though I like moon cakes too." `
`"...I'm surprised. `
`You know a lot about various cultures, don't you?" `
`"Well, I haven't been living a thousand years for nothing. `
`I've tried refined teas from all over the world. `
`Perhaps you could call it a journey through the world of tea." `
`"That does seem like it would be a wonderful way to travel the world. `
`Before today, I never knew that one could enjoy tea like this. `
`I will treasure this experience." `
`"I cannot leave Rokkenjima. `
`This is the only way I can travel. `
`What about you? `
`I'm sure you've elegantly traveled the world like any wealthy wife might." `
`".........Before Jessica was born, my husband took me to many countries. `
`Before marrying, I never once traveled overseas, so each time was a fresh and new experience." `
`"...Hmph. `
`Sounds like you were also born into a very rigid family." `
`"............ `
`...It was strict, but they gave me a wonderful upbringing. `
`It would be rude to my father and mother to call that rigid." `
`"That's a pretty eloquent way to call it rigid. *cackle*." `
`Krauss might have pitied Natsuhi. `
`Or, he might have wanted to take her away from the rigid Ushiromiya family for a little bit and let her rest. `
`...Or, he might simply have wanted to take his wife around countries he knew well, to show off everything he knew. `
`"Unlike Father, my husband is fond of Asian nations. `
`Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Thailand. `
`I think we also went to Malaysia." `
`"*cackle*cackle* `
`That Krauss... Was he trying to rebel against Kinzo's Western tastes? `
`But Asia is good too. `
`After all, the Japanese are strongly influenced by the West. `
`When they think of foreign countries, only Western ones come to mind. `
`But you mustn't forget the East." `
`"I myself knew a few things about the West, but I knew very little about the East... `
`I seem to recall my husband making fun of me now and then during our travels." `
`Beato subtly peered into Natsuhi's heart, as the latter grumbled that the trips had all been very tiring. `
`"Are you listening? `
`This is called an areca nut. `
`It's a popular luxury food item around here." `
`It looked like a small, round, gourd-like nut that had been smashed, with cucumber wedged in it. `
`At a glance, it looked as though it would probably taste like pickles. `
`"I-I see. `
`So I just bite it here...?" `
`As she tried to bite the one her husband was holding, he suddenly moved it away. `
`...It felt kind of embarrassing, like she was a fish after some bait. `
`"Whoa, wait up. `
`You have to eat it a certain way. `
`Yes, you are supposed to bite it. `
`Bite it. `
`Chew it. `
`But don't swallow it." `
`"Huh? `
`Even though you bite and chew it, you can't swallow it?" `
`"Yes. `
`Bite and chew. `
`Don't swallow. `
`And don't drink the juice. `
`It'll make your stomach hurt." `
`"I-I don't understand... `
`Why would you eat something like that??" `
`"Think of it as something like gum. `
`Chew it and enjoy the flavor. `
`Then take the scraps you've bitten and the juice and spit it out into a paper cup like this." `
`"...D-Dear, `
`the inside of your mouth is bright red...! `
`Wipe it off, wipe it off. `
`...Eeek!" `
`Even her favorite handkerchief, which she had wiped Krauss's mouth with, had bright red marks on it. `
`Something that's poisonous if eaten or drunk, and it makes the inside of your mouth so bright red, `
`and having to spit something out after you've put it in your mouth, ...how indecent! `
`...Thinking this, Natsuhi adamantly refused Krauss's invitation. `
`"No way, no way, I don't need any, I don't need any...!" `
`"This is a cross-cultural experience. `
`What's the point of traveling if we don't do things that can only be done here?" `
`Krauss kept chewing, ignoring the fact that even his lips were being colored bright red. `
`"Father likes these too. `
`He must have ordered them long ago, because he used to chew away at them on the mansion's terrace. `
`Although it seems he stopped ever since you arrived." `
`"Look here, Father, the person you respect even more than me, enjoyed these all the time. `
`Look, look, don't be shy, take some." `
`"No, no, stop it, stop it, deeeear!" `
`...During travel, Krauss had the innocence of a child. `
`He didn't even conceal his jealousy of the respect Natsuhi normally gave Kinzo. `
`Just being able to see that side of her husband made traveling all the way to another country worthwhile... `
`Krauss urged her even harder to bite it, `
`but Natsuhi, undaunted, ran from place to place and finally yelled that he was being too pushy. `
`Krauss was miffed the whole bus ride. `
`What a child, to let a little thing like this get him down, `
`Natsuhi thought exasperatedly. `
`Then, a native tour guide in the bus took out one of those areca nuts and started explaining about it. `
`It had apparently been a beloved luxury item in these parts since ancient times, similar to tobacco. `
`Just like in Natsuhi's case, it was starting to be disliked by young people and was becoming obsolete. `
`...Furthermore, it was treated as a good luck charm in this area... `
`and was known as a symbol for couples. `
`She looked at her husband's face. `
`......He turned away abruptly, but it looked like his cheeks had gotten a little red... `
`"So, `
`you then leaned on your husband and held his hand, did you?! `
`What the heck, you and your husband share a pretty pure love, don't you?! `
`Did you get all fired up? `
`You know, like, that night{p:0:♪} `
`Kiiihihihihihihi!!" `
`Red-faced and avoiding Beato's eye, Natsuhi tried to hide her embarrassment by swallowing the patis whole, `
`chewing with her cheeks puffed out like a blowfish. `
`Beato said "Yep, this is the best snack anyone could have with tea" `
`and nodded several times, a broad smile on her face... `
`"However, that's only how it was when we were newlyweds. `
`Right now, I cannot even leave Rokkenjima. `
`I'm a bird in a cage." `
`"Well, it's the same for me. `
`I can keep dying, but I just can't escape Rokkenjima. `
`I'm also a bird in a cage." `
`"I don't know much about you, and I won't pry. `
`...However, I do see that you face circumstances not to be taken lightly." `
`"I have no desire to act like the chief prisoner here. `
`Let's be friendly as fellow birds in this cage. `
`I've taken a liking to you." `
`"Really? `
`Thank you." `
`"The instructions and orders you gave the servants for this family conference were superb. `
`You took everything from where Kinzo would be and when, what he did, and what he left behind, `
`and put it all together splendidly without any contradictions. `
`That detailed written plan of yours had the same beauty as a high-level magic circle." `
`To make it look like Kinzo actually existed and was living life his own way, `
`she had written his schedule for the day down to the finest detail and made the servants follow it to the letter. `
`When did he meet whom and where, and what did he leave them? `
`When did he do what and where, and what changed? `
`As a result, even though the relatives never saw Kinzo even once, `
`they hadn't suspected in the slightest that he hadn't been there. `
`Eva and the rest truly believed that Kinzo had just happened to be walking through the hall when he heard them talking about the inheritance and went into a rage. `
`Everything had gone just as Natsuhi's plan had predicted, down to the finest detail. `
`And the cooperation by the servants had also worked smoothly, down to the finest detail... `
`"We had to stop this secret from getting out no matter the cost. `
`That's why I double-checked the plan thoroughly." `
`"Your willpower and attention to detail summoned success with certainty. `
`...As a witch, it seems that you're in Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s camp. `
`At your current level, as soon as you become self-aware of that as magic, you will be worthy of calling yourself a witch apprentice." `
`"If you call something like that magic, then that would make Kumasawa the witch of feigned illnesses. `
`It's only on busy days that she calls us to say she's taking the day off because of her bad back. `
`Like every year's family conference, for example." `
`"Oh, no, you've got Kumasawa completely wrong there. `
`She's a witch of a much, much higher level. `
`If you knew what she really was, it'd shock you! `
`*cackle*cackle*!" `
`Watching these two have their pleasant chat... `
`was another pair with steam rising from their black tea. `
`However, this second pair was in a world that the first couldn't see, where golden roses bloomed. `
`"...Ronove was kind enough to make us some of that Dimbula tea too." `
`"..................Nn..." `
`It felt as though Beato muttered something. `
`For the first time, it felt as though something had gotten through to her. `
`Surely, she had taken an interest in the black tea and felt like drinking it... `
`Thinking this, Battler took Beato's cup and her hand, making her hold the cup... `
`"............Nng, ........." `
`Beato's eyes trembled sadly, and her fingers shook. `
`Almost as though she couldn't even move her fingers as she wanted to... `
`...and was mourning the fact that she could no longer enjoy the tea she had once loved by her own power... `
`That's how she looked... `
`So Battler put his hand on Beato's, grabbed hold of the tea cup, and lifted it to her lips... `
`......Then, ...though it was only a single mouthful, ...Beato sipped. `
`The days they'd had been locked in a killing-fest with red swords and blue wedges... `
`already seemed like the distant past. `
`Now, not only was Beato unable to do that, ...it was even difficult for her to make her body do as she pleased. `
`Even just drinking a mouthful of black tea like this was hard... `
`"...How is it? `
`That rose aroma makes for a great black tea. `
`Do you like it...?" `
`"..............." `
`Of course, `
`......Beato didn't respond. `
`"...What happened to you...? `
`...Is this...another strategy? `
`Are you pretending to be in a slump so you can shock me later?" `
`".................." `
`"...If that's what you're after, the same trick won't work again, so give it a rest. `
`...I can't get fired up with you like this." `
`".................." `
`"Hey. `
`...Isn't it about time for you to start laughing loudly, saying "Caught you, dumbass!" or something? `
`Any kind of joke stops being funny if you drag it out too much. `
`Especially if it's a rehash." `
`"..............." `
`"Laugh. `
`Just like you're cackling over there as you drink with Aunt Natsuhi." `
`"..........................." `
`"..............." `
`"...............................................................................................................................................................{0}..." `
`"............Can't you at least grin...?" `
`"Never again. `
`This child will never laugh again." `
`Those sudden words...were exceedingly cruel. `
`"How can you say that for sure?! `
`Don't you try to take Beato's right to laugh away from her." `
`"...Oh, should I say it in red then...?" `
`I shook my head furiously. `
`Then, with an expression that didn't reveal her thoughts in the slightest, {f:5:Bernkastel} spoke while looking at Beato's face. `
`...And the word she used was completely incomprehensible to me. `
`{a:c: `
`"Congratulations."} `
`"......For what?" `
`"Beato is like this as a result of your victory." `
`"......What are you talking about...?" `
`"You said something interesting in a previous game. `
`You said this would be torture where you both torment each other. `
`That was right. `
`It's torture for Beato as well. `
`And, you won that torture game. `
`...That's why Beato's soul was killed, why she became a doll-like corpse." `
`"Are you saying...I did this to Beato?" `
`"The battle ends when one of you loses the will to try and win. `
`...As far as the battle between you and Beato goes, that was already concluded in the previous game. `
`Well, it probably happened without you noticing though." `
`"......In that case, why hasn't the game ended, if I've already won? `
`...Why is this game still continuing?" `
`"The shackle attached to that girl's ankle. `
`...That's a rule Lambda made." `
`Even if {f:5:Beatrice} tries to yield or gets discouraged or gives up, `
`she isn't capable of stepping down from the game. `
`...That's the rule. `
`Or maybe it's a curse. `
`"In the past, `
`I supported you when it looked like you were gonna give in. `
`Though you probably couldn't perceive it, `
`I assisted you by giving you hints and making things go your way. `
`That's why you're able to be here now. `
`......Remember? Remember how I saved you?" `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} stared at me... `
`...It's true I wasn't aware of it, `
`...but just maybe, `
`...I was saved by her. `
`"In the same way, Lambda is supporting Beato. `
`And this time, Beato is on the verge of giving in. `
`That's why Lambda's been giving her support this round, to keep her from giving in. `
`That's what the shackle is. `
`By refusing to let her resign, she's rescued Beato within the game." `
`"...Rescued her from what?" `
`"Normally, there are only two ways for this game to end. `
`Either one side will accept defeat and resign, `
`or one side will win the game with a checkmate. `
`Beato was about to collide with the first way. `
`That's why Lambda crushed that chance and managed to just barely avoid losing. `
`By the rules of this game, that's an impressive bit of support." `
`So, the only way this game can end now...is if I win. `
`At the very least, until I do win, `
`this witch called {f:5:Lambdadelta} can probably try to buy time for Beato to make a comeback. `
`But, ...that'll just prolong Beato's suffering even more... `
`Neither of us want that. `
`Both Beato and I fought with all we had, trying to win. `
`The game repeated several times because we were both giving it everything we could muster. `
`Then, that one time, `
`we confronted each other head on with all of our strength. `
`And......Beato acknowledged her loss. `
`She said she wanted me to end this game...and entrusted everything to me. `
`So, {f:5:Bernkastel}'s words are the truth. `
`She said it's my fault Beato's become a living corpse. `
`...That's true. `
`But it's something both of us wanted. `
`"Our match has already been resolved. `
`...Even so, the game won't end. `
`That's why Beato put her trust in me. `
`She told me to win quickly and end this game." `
`"............" `
`Now that the game's been resolved, letting it continue any further means endless torture for Beato. `
`......Nothing more than a nightmare. `
`I've gotta give her a perfect checkmate, end this game in the truest sense, `
`...and let her rest in peace... `
`For that reason, I'll keep fighting. `
`But by continuing the game, Beato's eternal torture will continue. `
`It felt as though I could only let her sleep peacefully by slowly strangling her to death... `
`"......I'm starting to feel like truth doesn't matter anymore. `
`...As long as Beato's satisfied, who cares what happens in the game? `
`Beato resigned. `
`I'll abandon the truth of the Illusion of the Witch and return home with my family. `
`......Is there anything wrong with that?" `
`If only {f:5:Lambdadelta} hadn't placed the curse of that shackle on her, this battle would be over already. `
`......That's why I found it detestable. `
`This game, which I can't finish without tormenting Beato more, `
`...is detestable. `
`"...Whaat's this? `
`Beato's starting to look like she's in pain every time you get closer to the truth, so you're suddenly going easy on her...? `
`Then go easy on her as much as you can. `
`And why don't you just let Beato win while you're at it? `
`Then your little sister can have a lonely, tragic future forced on her endlessly." `
`"That's not how it is...... `
`........." `
`...That's right... `
`I have to return for Ange's sake as well. `
`I know this isn't the time to start feeling compassion for Beato. `
`"In that case, make sure you kill her. `
`Kill this witch without fail." `
`"....................." `
`Even though Beato was right there, `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} spoke without holding back... `
`"Your goal is to kill this woman. `
`......In the last game, you said it at Beato's request. `
`You said "I'll kill you"." `
`"......Yeah, that may be true, `
`but that doesn't mean you get to complain about it." `
`"Did you know? `
`When you tear one of your fingernails out, it's better to do it in one go. `
`...Pulling it out like you do... `
`timidly, twisting and slow...hurts much, much more. `
`What you're doing sounds much more like torture to me." `
`"............" `
`"If you have any compassion, kill her all at once. `
`That's how killing works." `
`"That's none of your business. `
`I'm the one who gets to decide how to perform her last rites. `
`You and that {f:5:Lambdadelta} witch have nothing to do with this. `
`I'll kill her. `
`I won't let anyone else do it." `
`"......As long as you don't lose that willpower. `
`I'm betting on you. `
`Okay? `
`Make sure you don't forget. `
`"{p:1:Unless this game is resolved, you will never be released}. `
`You won't be allowed to abandon this game either." `
`"...I get it." `
`"I know what Lambda's after. `
`She wants to make you lose your will to fight just like Beato, `
`to make you a pair of living dolls, to keep this world in perpetual equilibrium. `
`...You don't want that, do you? `
`I wouldn't like it either." `
`"Why should I give a damn about what you want? `
`Still, I won't throw this game away. `
`I won't abandon my responsibility to fight against Beato." `
`"I'm glad our goals are the same. `
`So, you'll be able to kill this child without any hesitation, right?" `
`"....................." `
`".........That's right." `
`"....................." `
`I have no way of knowing whether those words eased her pain or hurt her. `
`...But I can tell by the dull tingling in my chest... `
`that I surely believe I've hurt her. `
`I have no way of knowing what the silent Beato feels. `
`...If I think I've hurt her, `
`...does that mean she's actually been hurt? `
`And, if I didn't think I'd hurt her, `
`would that mean no one's gotten hurt because of me? `
`.................. `
`"...So, `
`about that Beato who's drinking tea over there with Natsuhi. `
`You can handle that, right...?" `
`"Yeah... `
`...No problem." `
`"It's the same as it was with Kinzo. `
`{f:5:Beatrice} doesn't exist. `
`This is a fake illusion of a witch that Natsuhi created, since she believes she was borrowing a witch's power when she thought up a brilliant plan to overcome hardship. `
`It only looks like they're drinking together `
`because {f:5:Lambdadelta}, who's the Game Master and {i:the one telling the story}, interpreted it that way." `
`"If you could stare at this scene without a fragment of love for Natsuhi, you wouldn't see an illusion like that. `
`...That's why with my eyes, all I can see is Natsuhi all alone, drinking her tea in silence." `
`Without love, it cannot be "seen". `
`Because love is lacking, it cannot be "seen". `
`"You're looking at a daydream Natsuhi's showing us. `
`...{f:5:Beatrice} doesn't exist there." `
`"............Ugh......" `
`Beato mumbled softly. `
`...It was a small voice that made it sound like she was in pain. `
`The thorn of {f:5:Bernkastel}'s truth had stabbed into her chest. `
`"...Yeah, that's probably true. `
`I think your theory's right. `
`But don't say that in front of Beato." `
`"It doesn't matter where I say it. `
`This is Beato's world we're in." `
`"...Also, it's not like I'm protecting Beato, `
`but it's still possible Aunt Natsuhi really is drinking tea with some unknown person X, who calls themselves {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`This scene takes place a year before everything. `
`The number of people on the island on this day has never been shown with the red truth." `
`".........Sure. `
`Even Lambda hasn't said anything in red about the number of people on Rokkenjima on this day." `
`"In that case, `
`it's possible for Aunt Natsuhi to claim that she really did drink tea with a woman calling herself {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`Just like I can't deny your theory, you can't deny mine. `
`That means you can't say for sure whether the Beato there is an illusion or not." `
`"......Oh, is this cat box theory? `
`That might've worked on Beato, but it won't work on me." `
`"Why not?" `
`" `
`{p:1:After all, Natsuhi is drinking tea all by herself right there}." `
`There was a violent sound of glass breaking, `
`...and the Beato who laughed happily and cracked jokes about Natsuhi's newlywed years... `
`was erased. `
`...A lonely wind blew, `
`...and the one person who remained on the bench drinking tea with a tired expression... `
`...was Aunt Natsuhi, all by herself...... `
`".........Nng, ggh..............." `
`Beato...groaned. `
`I could see clearly that she was in anguish. `
`Another illusion of the witch had been smashed, ...drawing Beato towards death. `
`...In short, this is what the battle to let Beato rest in peace is all about... `
`A second ago, {f:5:Bernkastel} likened our fight to the torture of tearing fingernails out. `
`If I have to tear them out anyway, `
`...then my last bit of compassion towards Beato should be to minimize that pain. `
`In other words, ...even if I want to minimize her pain, I still have to cause it. `
`I have to accept...that look of anguish on her face... `
`And at the same time, `
`...I realized what a merciless thing the red truth was. `
`...Right now, in this rose garden, there's no one except Aunt Natsuhi. `
`In other words, there are no observers except for Aunt Natsuhi. `
`So, if that lone observer were to say that she'd had some tea with Beato, `
`...no one should be able to refute that. `
`...If there's something no one can deny, ...doesn't that mean it's truth? `
`Aunt Natsuhi is enjoying the roses and drinking tea together with Beato. `
`...How could anyone have the right to mercilessly trample that pleasant moment...? `
`"......The red truth is like a blade." `
`"..............." `
`"In a battle with a witch, it's a blade that sometimes tears your theories apart, but sometimes becomes a weapon you can fight back with." `
`"...I know. `
`So what?" `
`"Don't use it without reason." `
`"........." `
`"A blade is a tool if you use it when you're supposed to, `
`...but it's a weapon if you use it out of malice." `
`True enough, Aunt Natsuhi wasn't really drinking tea with a witch. `
`However, saying that with the red truth probably has nothing to do with our game. `
`Our game is the tale of October 1986. `
`The two days of the crime give us more than enough time to injure each other, with our red and blue blades glistening. `
`"This isn't about the Illusion of the Witch. `
`...It's about Aunt Natsuhi's privacy. `
`How could anyone have the right to expose that?" `
`"............ `
`...Do you want to acknowledge that a witch actually existed here and drank tea with Natsuhi? `
`Weren't you trying to deny the existence of witches?" `
`"...That's right, if we're talking about our game, the two-day period from October 4th to October 5th in 1986. `
`But I have no desire to question whether or not witches exist outside that game board." `
`"In the first place, the Devil's Proof argument makes it impossible to deny the existence of witches. `
`And, according to the rules of this game, saying something like what you did in red is a forbidden move that leads to a stalemate. `
`You can't deny the existence of witches, not even with the red truth." `
`".........True. `
`...I never thought I'd hear you talk so glibly about witches existing. `
`.........Not bad, Lambda. `
`You've done a good job getting Battler stuck between his human culprit theory and the idea that witches existing wouldn't be so bad." `
`"She really excels at controlling Human hearts. `
`...Looks like I'd better start helping you out even more." `
`"I really couldn't care less about you two. `
`Disappear. `
`This game is between Beato and me. `
`We're gonna keep this game to ourselves." `
`".........No way." `
`"What...?" `
`"After all, `
`I'm enjoying this game too. `
`......*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle* Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha......" `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} disappeared, leaving only that unpleasant laugh behind. `
`"..............." `
`After that, all that remained was Natsuhi, sipping tea all alone, `
`...Beato, her hand still on the tea cup as she stared blankly at the surface of the liquid, `
`...and me. `
`"...{f:5:Bernkastel} and {f:5:Lambdadelta}... `
`...{f:5:Virgilia} called them your friends, but... `
`...you really should choose your friends more carefully. `
`Or wait, maybe they actually make a good match with an ill-natured person like you..." `
`"..............." `
`"........." `
`Beato didn't answer. `
`Battler took Beato's hand, made her hold the cup again, and brought it to her lips. `
`......Beato made a quiet sound in her throat and drank another gulp... `
`Then, Natsuhi's lonely teatime ended. `
`...That truth, which was Natsuhi's alone and observed by no one else, had been defiled. `
`In Natsuhi's world, surely... `
`...that tea party, which had been peaceful despite her annoyance at Beato for making fun of her too much, came to an end, and the two of them parted ways. `
`However, in Natsuhi's exposed truth, ...she was all alone. `
`Natsuhi tottered away. `
`...On the bench, only a single person's cup remained... `
