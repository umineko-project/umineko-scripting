`Erika's seat was the lowest one in rank. `
`In other words, it was at the inferior end of the table. `
`Since Kinzo's seat at the high end of the table was empty, `
`if you spun the whole thing around, it sort of looked like Erika was the host of this dinner... `
`"Well then, everyone. `
`I would like to begin tonight's dinner, if I may." `
`After Gohda's announcement, dinner began with the applause that had become almost customary. `
`It was finally the beginning of the dinner orchestra conducted by Toshiro Gohda. `
`Except for Krauss's household, sitting at such a majestic dinner table was no everyday thing for these people by any means. `
`However, they were all used to this event and acted as though it was completely normal. `
`...Once again, if anyone was to be surprised, it should have been Erika. `
`And yet, she showed no signs of amazement at this dinner and acted with composure, `
`blending in with everyone else. `
`...There wasn't even a sliver of the fear one might expect from someone who had wandered here like a lost puppy. `
`"......What an odd child. `
`She doesn't seem the least bit flustered by the Ushiromiya family's grandest dinner of the year." `
`"Kids these days have nerves of steel. `
`...Definitely not something I dislike." `
`"Is Furudo-san used to meals such as this one...? `
`She seems to be quite composed." `
`"No kiddin'. `
`She looks really experienced. `
`Heck, I still get confused about which fork I'm supposed to use next. `
`Hmm, ...was it this one, or this one...? `
`Wahahahahaha!" `
`Without showing any confusion over the line of utensils in front of her, Erika gracefully ate her hors d'oeuvres. `
`Hideyoshi had started joking around with her, gripping a fork in each hand. `
`Of course, the president of a company in the food service industry like Hideyoshi obviously knew his table manners. `
`However, thinking that Erika must be nervous over this dinner, he had intentionally spoken with a comic tone of voice. `
`"......You just have to start on the outside and work your way in. `
`...If that's a pain, then just ask for some chopsticks. `
`...If you're Japanese, you've got to love chopsticks." `
`"Chopsticks are so great. `
`Just one pair of those, and you can deal with any kind of food!" `
`As soon as she began talking about chopsticks, her eyes started glittering. `
`...The smile she now showed for the first time was far different from the dignity she'd displayed before, more like something you'd expect from someone her age. `
`"*giggle* `
`But even you would use a spoon for curry and rice, wouldn't you?" `
`"Just make it a {c:86EF9C:donburi} bowl. `
`Is there anyone who eats beef bowls with a spoon? `
`Of course not. `
`For the Japanese, it's absolutely, positively, totally chopsticks! `
`So, Gohda-san. `
`Would you mind bringing me some chopsticks? `
`I want to show everyone how a true Japanese person should eat, without any shame!" `
`"...By the way, what are we eating next?" `
`"Unfortunately, that would be soup." `
`As she imitated a shrugging gesture, Erika winked at everyone. `
`"""Wahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!""" `
`Of course, no one was laughing at her. `
`She obviously knew that soup came after hors d'oeuvres in a full course meal. `
`Furthermore, Erika had noticed both that she'd been performing too perfectly `
`and creating a sense of tension... `
`and that Hideyoshi had tried to break the ice because he thought she was nervous. `
`That's why she started acting a little childish and light-hearted, `
`acting out the part of a guest enjoying a harmonious dinner... `
`Pretty soon, not only Kyrie, but everyone else caught on. `
`Though she was an uninvited guest, she was apparently worthy of participating in an Ushiromiya family dinner. `
`"Smart kid. `
`...Did she really just come here by coincidence? `
`Don't tell me you secretly called your illegitimate child to today's family conference, Nii-san?" `
`"It seems she even has the smarts to brighten the mood. `
`And her manners are simply wonderful. `
`It wouldn't be bad at all to have this girl as a daughter." `
`"Hihihihi. `
`That's pretty cruel. `
`Where does that leave Jessica-chan?" `
`"*giggle* `
`That's mean, Rudolf nii-san." `
`"What's wrong, Jessica-chan? `
`Headache?" `
`"Uuuu... `
`I get the feeling my reputation's taking a dive..." `
`"Well, if you're a daughter of the Head Family, you'd better not let her beat you. `
`Try using those table manners and dignity Aunt Natsuhi's always training you with, and fight back!" `
`"I wanna see, I wanna see! `
`I wanna see table manners! `
`Uu-!" `
`"Hey, jumping around is bad manners. `
`Come on, Jessica-chan. `
`Show us how it's done." `
`"...S-Sure, of course..." `
`Jessica straightened up so much it looked like someone had poked her back with a pole. `
`...She had good posture, but it somehow lacked elegance. `
`She looked...well...kind of like a triangle ruler. `
`She sat at attention with her gaze fixed straight ahead, tried to bring her food to her mouth despite this, `
`...and failed miserably. `
`Dad, who was sitting next to her, suddenly realized that something was up. `
`"Hmm? `
`What's wrong, Jessica-chan? `
`Stomachache??" `
`Jessica turned bright red. `
`...Ah, sorry, I can't help myself... `
`We laughed our heads off. `
`Jessica protested, still bright red. `
`Aunt Natsuhi scolded us for being too improper. `
`Well, no matter how much we try to smooth it over, we are who we are. `
`We couldn't pretend any longer. `
`Still, that laugh really did help us to relax. `
`We were so concerned about the guest getting nervous, we'd gotten even more nervous ourselves. `
`Our chatter from the center of this long table spread to both ends, `
`and ultimately, the dinner went even more smoothly than usual... `
`With some delicious cheese and coffee, our peaceful meal came to an end. `
`Gohda won unanimous acclaim and was praised for his skill by all present... `
`After a short period of harmony following the meal, it was decided that we would return to the guesthouse. `
`Normally, dinner tended to have a very dark atmosphere about it, `
`and the adults would often keep that mood as they moved straight on to the family conference. `
`However, perhaps because this year's dinner had been oddly peaceful, everyone decided to take a break, the adults included. `
`After eating, taking a bath, and relaxing while watching TV, `
`I wonder if they'll gather again in the mansion with all this rain and resume that high-tension family conference of theirs... `
`I'd rather not think about it. `
`Apparently, Aunt Eva was getting really worked up, trying to convince the rest to start the family conference right away, but it didn't look like many people agreed with her. `
`They would probably call it quits for the night. `
`Since they had guesthouse duty, Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san were chosen to guide us to the guesthouse. `
`It's gotta be tough for Gohda-san. `
`Even after making and cleaning up such an extravagant dinner, he also has the late night shift at the guesthouse. `
`I heard that Kumasawa-san, old as she was, would be going to sleep soon. `
`It seems she was assigned a spare room. `
`"Allow me to guide everyone to the guesthouse. `
`Erika-sama, a room has also been prepared for you." `
`"......Thank you very much." `
`"Why not rest a bit? `
`Are you sure you feel okay?" `
`"...That's right. `
`I'd totally forgotten, but you nearly drowned and floated here, didn't you, Erika-chan? `
`You'd probably be better off taking it easy and getting to bed early tonight." `
`"......I'm perfectly fine. `
`...On the contrary, I'm so nervous and excited that I doubt I could get any sleep." `
`"Uu-uu-!! `
`Then let's play, let's all play together! `
`Let's play cards!" `
`Maria latched onto her, giggling. `
`This lack of restraint peculiar to youth was very much like Maria. `
`...However, we really should be concerned for Erika's physical condition now. `
`"Maria, why don't you play cards with us? `
`Erika onee-chan is tired." `
`"...I like cards too. `
`Please let me join you after I've had a short break." `
`"Uu-uu-uu-!! All right!!" `
`".........Who is that?" `
`As she passed through the lobby of the entrance hall, Erika stopped walking... `
`When we saw what she was looking at, ...the rest of us also stopped. `
`"...Oh, that is the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}-sama." `
`"......The Golden... `
`...Witch." `
`"What're you doing, brats? `
`Go on and head back to the guesthouse." `
`Dad, Kyrie-san, Aunt Eva, Uncle Hideyoshi, and Aunt Rosa all came over. `
`The entire guesthouse party had gathered. `
`However, Erika's gaze was captured by the portrait of the witch, and she simply stared at it for a while... `
`"...Yeah. `
`Supposedly, Dad has a stash of hidden gold worth 20 billion yen, `
`and this epitaph shows you where that gold's hidden." `
`Perhaps it was too early for them all to disperse into their individual rooms, `
`because the relatives who had returned to the guesthouse all gathered on the first floor, continuing their chat. `
`The topic...was the witch's epitaph, which Erika had taken an interest in. `
`"......It really is a fascinating riddle. `
`......He stuck it out in a place where anyone could see it, challenging our intelligence. `
`......I love that kind of challenge." `
`"Whoa. `
`You seem surprisingly interested, Erika-chan. `
`Do you like solving riddles or something?" `
`"...Don't challenges like this seem interesting? `
`.........It seems pretty clear `
`that Kinzo-san wants to use that epitaph to choose his successor." `
`When she said that, the adults stopped moving... `
`and slowly turned to face Erika... `
`"Why......do you think that...?" `
`Aunt Eva spoke with a coaxing voice. `
`...Though, every now and then, there had been whisperings among the relatives that whoever solved the epitaph's riddle might be given the family inheritance, `
`...this had been no more than wishful thinking, since such a thing had never been specifically stated. `
`And yet, though she had only read it once, ...this outsider had already reached that conclusion. `
`How had she come to it? `
`No, ......that's not the problem. `
`"If you solve the epitaph, you can become the next Head". `
`She wasn't trying to make it sound like wishful thinking, ...but an outright fact. `
`So they closed in around Erika, asking why she was so sure. `
`"......It's fairly common for an extremely rich person to relinquish his or her wealth to the solver of some sort of riddle. `
`...Furthermore, Kinzo-san didn't publish this epitaph in a newspaper, `
`but displayed it in his mansion. `
`That means the riddle is directed at the people in this mansion." `
`"You're right... `
`......Since it's inside the mansion, there's no way for someone who can't enter the mansion to solve it. `
`...So, that means Grandfather's been challenging the people here." `
`"......<Good>. `
`Well thought. `
`Just by the simple fact that the epitaph's inside the mansion, it's possible to figure out that much." `
`At first, this Furudo Erika girl seemed to be the fairly silent type, `
`...but that apparently wasn't the case. `
`As she grew excited by a challenge to a game of wits, she became much more talkative than I'd imagined. `
`"I-I see... `
`Well, it does make sense that an epitaph inside a mansion would be there so the people in that mansion could read it..." `
`"But...can you really be so sure that the one who solves it will be given the Headship too?" `
`"......If the treasure gained by solving the riddle were something small, `
`I wouldn't even have considered that." `
`"That's right. `
`The hidden gold is worth 20 billion. `
`...You might consider that gold itself to be the wealth of the Ushiromiya family." `
`".........Inheriting something like that would be almost the same as inheriting the Ushiromiya family itself. `
`...In other words, this riddle of the gold's hiding place buried within the epitaph is nothing less than a way of selecting the de facto Successor of the Ushiromiya Family." `
`...The idea that the one who solved the epitaph would be chosen as the Successor... `
`had been passed around by some of the relatives for a while now. `
`However, since it had never been specifically announced, it was nothing more than an optimistic dream. `
`...Thinking this, they decided to abandon all consideration of this point until the details were made clear. `
`Erika had clearly declared that this uncertain point was, in fact, true. `
`If one of the relatives had said it, people would have thought it to be merely an optimistic dream. `
`However, when this was declared by a complete outsider, `
`those words seemed even more credible... `
`Everyone remained silent for a while, slowly considering what those words implied... `
`"......Simply by the existence of the epitaph in that place, `
`this level of reasoning is possible for Furudo Erika. `
`...What do you think, everyone?" `
`"...S-Sorry to butt in, `
`but my dad's the Successor. `
`Finding the gold would be one thing, `
`but that doesn't mean you get to be the Head, right?" `
`Jessica thought the treasure-hunting part of the epitaph was really fun. `
`However, she couldn't help but let her expression grow bitter once they started talking about undermining her father's position... `
`"...By using deductive reasoning based upon my theory, `
`it seems likely that Kinzo-san doesn't want the Successor, Krauss-san, to inherit that position too smoothly." `
`"Wh-Why's that?!!" `
`"......Becoming the Head of the Ushiromiya family, with all of the vast wealth it entails, would mean gaining a great deal of influence in a political sense. `
`...So, under normal circumstances, the succession should be overseen rigorously, without letting any element of chance creep into the equation." `
`"Th-That's right. `
`...It happens a lot in those stories about Sengoku military commanders that my husband loves. `
`When there are multiple candidates for the successor, it usually results in an internal squabble..." `
`"...That's right... `
`That's why it's important to clearly specify a successor, so you can avoid any trouble. `
`Sometimes, there's even a purge of all the competing successors." `
`The Sengoku commander Hideyoshi admired, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, made his son-in-law Hidetsugu commit seppuku, `
`but it was rumored that he might have done this to make Hideyori, who was his real son and born after Hidetsugu, his true heir. `
`...In other words, naming a successor was a way to make it generally known that a single, unique person would be acknowledged by everyone, `
`and a way to remove any chance of another person becoming an opposing candidate. `
`"......<Good>. `
`That's exactly right. `
`The only purpose for an epitaph like that would be to cast doubt on Krauss-san's position as the Successor. `
`In other words, if Kinzo-san wanted Krauss-san to become the Head smoothly, he'd have no reason to go out of his way and display something so dangerous for all to see." `
`"That's right. `
`......If you spin the chessboard around, you certainly could say that. `
`It would be odd if he handed over the position of the Head normally, but only handed over the 20 billion yen in gold to the person who solves the riddle." `
`Kinzo would pass on the title of Family Head, but he would only give up the 20 billion yen in gold to the person who solved the epitaph. `
`...You really couldn't call this passing on the Headship in the truest sense. `
`"......That's how it is. `
`By this theory, we are able to doubt whether Kinzo-san truly acknowledged Krauss-san as his successor. `
`...Simply by the existence of the epitaph in that place, `
`this level of reasoning is possible for Furudo Erika." `
`"...What do you think, Jessica-san?" `
`"Wh-What the hell?!! `
`How do you call that reasoning?! `
`That's bullshit!! It's screwed up!!" `
`Jessica let her emotions lay bare and glared at Erika. `
`...Erika, on the other hand, `
`looked exceedingly calm with an expression that said "Well, that's just the truth, right?" `
`......I see. `
`It looks like table manners aren't the only way this girl is fitting for the Ushiromiya family. `
`...It seems she really does match the family, ...even when it'd be better if she didn't... `
`"Okay, ...t-take it easy, Jessica... `
`...And Erika, let's leave it at that for now." `
`"Well, umm, we can put all this successor stuff to the side for now. `
`Anyway, there's no doubt that it's Father's big question for us. `
`...Wahahaha! `
`It's 20 billion yen! `
`Maria-chan, what'd you use it for if you found it? `
`Wahahahahahahaha!" `
`"...Uu-. `
`The Golden Land isn't just gold. `
`It's a sacred place!" `
`Uncle Hideyoshi kept trying to force himself to chuckle and improve the mood. `
`Everyone else tried to play along, but Jessica's mood didn't get any better. `
`"H-Hahahaha. `
`So, Erika-chan, would you like to have a go at the epitaph's riddle?" `
`"......Yes. `
`My little gray cells are itching to get started. `
`I'd like to start solving as soon as possible." `
`George-aniki smoothly turned the conversation around. `
`Just like the time she'd made everyone laugh in the dining hall, Erika looked about with gleeful eyes and jumped at the chance. `
`"*giggle*giggle* `
`I like it. `
`......Well, since Erika seems so interested, `
`let's all try and solve it together, just like last year." `
`"I'll make some coffee. `
`Raise your hand if you want some. `
`Not for you, Maria! `
`You won't be able to sleep...!" `
`"Uu-uu-!! `
`I wanna drink black coffee!!" `
`"..............." `
`"...Don't they get you excited, `
`riddles like this? `
`......I love them." `
`Erika said that and smiled... `
`Though she must've known that she'd ticked Jessica off and made the atmosphere sour, `
`...she just smiled nonchalantly... `
`"...See? Without even waiting for the crime on October 5th, there's a riddle you can solve." `
`"............ `
`...I've tried to solve it many times myself. `
`But-" `
`"......But you didn't have a clue, so you gave up and stopped thinking. `
`...Right?" `
`It pissed me off, but I don't have a good counter for that. `
`After all, ...I don't get the epitaph at all. `
`I don't even know what the beloved hometown means, much less the parts about the sweetfish river and the key... `
`Thinking that a few more hints would show up if I waited, `
`...I kept on waiting...and just stopped thinking... `
`"......Have you figured out an answer of your own? `
`...Because I'm about to {i:solve it}." `
`"Wh-What...?" `
`"This is where Bern solved the riddle of the epitaph. `
`...I'd expect no less from the Witch of Miracles. `
`"If a riddle is solvable, she can solve it without fail, regardless of the difficulty". `
`...How many years did it take to solve this one?" `
`"......That's rude. `
`I only fished through a few hundred Fragments." `
`"Heheheheheheheheheheh... `
`You really are terrifying." `
`"You aren't going to cheat by suddenly saying the answer in red or something like that, right...?" `
`"......Don't worry. `
`Just like you, I follow the rules as a player. `
`...Well, shall we begin? `
`......It's cramped here. `
`Why don't we talk over the sea?" `
`"OK. `
`...Don't get queasy, Battler." `
`"What do you mean, the sea...? `
`.........?!" `
`I thought the whole world had turned pitch black, and the next moment, `
`...I was struck by a strange floating sensation. `
`This must be what it feels like to suddenly have the floor drop from under you, sending you into a bottomless pit... `
`When I looked, `
`...I saw that the two witches and I... `
`had been thrown into a pitch-black universe. `
`In this space, every direction was covered in an endless darkness, and it felt like a limitless expanse filled with countless glittering objects. `
`...Some people might have likened it to the depths of an ocean where innumerable sparkling fragments drifted. `
`"Nng, ......wh-whoa........." `
`".........Didn't she tell you not to get queasy?" `
`"If you want the concept of gravity, just create it yourself, okay? `
`...Come on, calm down and look at us. `
`...Come on, don't we look like we're just fine? `
`...Believe that your feet are on the ground and that you're being controlled by gravity. `
`...If you do that, you'll find your equilibrium." `
`Y-Yes, the two witches are standing normally, as if their feet were planted on transparent pieces of glass. `
`I'm the only one floating about like someone in a rapidly plummeting elevator. `
`...When I saw that they were doing just fine, I started calming down, figuring that there was no need to be scared. `
`Then, just as {f:5:Lambdadelta} said, `
`I gritted my teeth and kept telling myself that there was a place to stand here...and that I had to stay calm... `
`"...Wh-Whoa..." `
`"Very good, very good. `
`...What's your name?" `
`"Ushiromiya Battler. `
`...Who else do I look like?" `
`"OK. `
`You mustn't lose your will, emotions, or form. `
`After all, this is the ocean. `
`If you lose your purpose, you'll fall into the depths of eternity and become a scrap of ocean seaweed. `
`Be careful." `
`I don't get what {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s saying, but I should calm down for the time being. `
`It seems that I regain my equilibrium the more I calm down. `
`Gradually, that weird floating feeling, like I was falling forever, began to disappear. `
`...It still felt strange, like trying to stand up straight at the bottom of a deep pool, but it was much better than before. `
`"......Then let's begin. `
`......I'll weave together some Fragments for solving the riddle of the epitaph..." `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} opened both of her hands. `
`Then, like a planetarium, `
`...all of the Fragments throughout this empty space began to spin, leaving tails behind them... `
`The expression "planetarium" might've been surprisingly fitting... `
`...Multiple Fragments were tied together by gold lines, `
`and what looked like constellations zoomed by us rapidly, one after another. `
`It felt almost as though we were dashing through space at an incredible speed... `
`Then, with tails of light drifting behind them, `
`...several brightly glowing Fragments swirled around {f:5:Bernkastel}. `
`It looked almost like she'd created her own solar system, with her as the sun. `
`That solar system surrounding {f:5:Bernkastel} grew to a radius large enough to swallow us up. `
`And every once in a while, one of those satellite Fragments zoomed right past me. `
`When those Fragments passed by me, `
`...it felt as though some kind of memory welled up inside me. `
`So I sensed it. `
`...These Fragments are probably like a crystallization of memories. `
`"They aren't memories. `
`They're Fragments of worlds. `
`...Well, I guess they might feel like memories to you." `
`"......Then let's begin. `
`...Let's start with this Fragment." `
`One of the satellites in this solar system was slowly sucked into an inward trajectory with {f:5:Bernkastel} at the center. `
`After drawing a spiral and approaching her, it settled down on the palm of {f:5:Bernkastel}'s outstretched hand... `
`Then, it glittered brightly, painting over the world with pure white... `
`"...The "beloved hometown" definitely won't betray our expectations. `
`...The only past Father held dear happened during his childhood years." `
`"......I remember that. `
`...This is from the 3rd game, when Aunt Eva was just about to solve the riddle of the epitaph...and was thinking it over with this witch inside her or whatever." `
`"............That's right. `
`And, from these thoughts, she made her way to the correct answer. `
`In other words, this Fragment shows a vital hint for reaching the truth. `
`......It means that {i:this theory is not mistaken}." `
`"So, ...you're saying we should assume this beloved hometown isn't a metaphor or anything like that, `
`...but the place Grandfather actually spent his youth?" `
`"......That's right. `
`And at the very least, it isn't Odawara." `
`"......Odawara is definitely where he was born, but I don't think that's the hometown he loved. `
`I imagine all of us siblings have the same place in mind." `
`"...Right. `
`This probably isn't Odawara. `
`From what I've heard, he had a very fun time as a youth." `
`"That's right... `
`...Aunt Eva and her siblings said it wasn't Odawara. `
`...And not only that, it looks like everyone guessed where Grandfather's hometown was." `
`"...Right. `
`And annoyingly, the actual location isn't spoken of in any of the Fragments." `
`"Well duh. `
`If I told you that, there'd be too many hints. `
`...If it wasn't a hard riddle, {i:there'd be no point to it}. `
`...Uh-oh, `
`that's a hint too. `
`*giggle*..." `
`"............ `
`...Just where is this hometown of Grandfather's? `
`...We can't even start if we don't know that..." `
`"You mean you couldn't start, so you stopped thinking? `
`...Since it had to be a place where he could've lived, the number of possibilities is limited. `
`......Well, this is the toughest part." `
`"......You were the witch who could "certainly solve any riddle that can be solved", weren't you? `
`...So you took those limited possibilities... `
`in other words, everywhere on the earth, and considered every single piece of land that Grandfather might've lived on?" `
`".........That would work too, but that way, no amount of time would be enough. `
`So, I needed to take some more hints into consideration to wring out the answer." `
`"...Didn't you say it yourself? `
`You said it didn't have to be a river with water flowing down it. `
`...If the word sweetfish is too complicated, why not forget it...?" `
`"Think of a river. `
`A river. `
`Linking it with a "family tree" wasn't a bad idea. `
`Try thinking about how to link a river with something else along those lines..." `
`"......A sweetfish river running through the hometown. `
`However, this river isn't truly a river. `
`...Eva thought of something else, something that could be linked with a river." `
`"Sure... `
`But if it isn't a river, then why the sweetfish...? `
`............" `
`"......Think. `
`A river that runs through the hometown. `
`...But it isn't a river with water running down it. `
`Something that can be likened to a river......" `
`"..............." `
`"......Behold the sweetfish river running through the beloved hometown. `
`...Eva knew where the hometown was, so she could forget about the sweetfish hint. `
`...However, since we don't know where it is, this could be a hint for us." `
`"......I worried too much about the sweetfish river. `
`The sweetfish part didn't really matter that much at all, did it?" `
`"That isn't true. `
`It was an excellent hint, wasn't it? `
`Well, of course, maybe there was no need for it to be sweetfish." `
`".........What are these "sweetfish"...? `
`...If the river isn't a literal river, then of course, "sweetfish" probably doesn't mean the kind of fish that swims." `
`"Yeah. `
`And on top of that, Rosa tossed it aside, saying that sweetfish weren't that significant." `
`"......On the other hand, Eva said it wasn't important for them to be sweetfish, but that it was still an excellent hint. `
`......In other words, the "sweetfish" is a key to make you think of something else. `
`If that something is a different word, but a word that sweetfish makes you think of, then Eva's line about how it "probably didn't have to be sweetfish" makes sense..." `
`".................." `
`From these thoughts, Aunt Eva formed some theory, `
`...went to the library, looked through some books, and "verified that she was right". `
`In short, Aunt Eva formed some theory about the true nature of this sweetfish river running through a hometown. `
`Then, ...she opened a certain book to determine whether that theory was correct or not. `
`In other words, this theory was something that could be verified through some kind of book... `
`Also, after she figured out what the sweetfish river was, she figured out the rest of the riddle very quickly... `
`"......Good thinking. `
`...The epitaph continues on, saying "as you travel down the river, you will see a village". `
`At that point in time, Eva hadn't yet solved the three lines starting with this one." `
`"...What is this village? `
`What does it mean?! `
`Do you find one if you go down the river...?! `
`.........Ah, ...aaaaaaaahhh...!!" `
`Right before my eyes, `
`...the pieces that I hadn't been able to understand at all... `
`...began to *snap*...*snap*... `
`into place, all by themselves... `
`I couldn't even remember to close my open mouth. `
`...My throat grew completely dry... `
`Is it...really okay for this to be the answer? `
`R-Really? `
`Really...?! `
`"...So... `
`if we figure out what the "sweetfish river running through the hometown" is, `
`...that leads us directly to understanding the "as you travel down the river, you will see a village" stuff, ...and then we get the key to the Golden Land." `
`"......Correct. `
`And we know that because even Eva didn't know what the village meant until she checked the book." `
`"Dammit... `
`...Just what is this book...?!" `
`"...But this isn't six characters at all. `
`...I'm absolutely sure this is the answer, but this doesn't reach six characters at all...!" `
`Did you stop thinking again? `
`In that case, think of a way you could read it with six characters. `
`If you can't think of one, then research it. `
`...There has to be an answer. `
`You must not doubt that. `
`Oh, is believing in that too much for you? If only you'd just cry yourself to sleep, and then you can just give up and die... `
`".........1, `
`2, `
`3, `
`4, `
`5, `
`6... `
`...Oooh, `
`...s `
`- `
`six characters... `
`...I- `
`I found it. `
`...This... `
`......is... `
`th- `
`the key to the Golden Land......!!" `
`".........Then, Eva found the key to the Golden Land." `
`"Yeah. `
`And this key... `
`...was some kind of word, number, or string of characters, ...six characters long!" `
`"......That's it. `
`If we know the key's true identity has six characters, the meaning of the first twilight changes drastically." `
`"O-On the first twilight, offer the six chosen by the key as sacrifices... `
`...The six...chosen by the key... `
`......Six characters...!" `
`In other words, ...it means to sacrifice the six characters chosen by the key on the first twilight...! `
`"This key indicates a certain group of six people. `
`...No, we should say it indicates a certain group of six things, `
`...if this doesn't mean a literal command to offer sacrifices. `
`For example, it could be an anagram." `
`"An anagram? `
`Do you mean playing with letters...?" `
`Yes, Kyrie-san has been thinking that way ever since that moment...! `
`"...On the second twilight, there are "those who remain". `
`...Which means that, at the very least, that "something" has a limited number of characters. `
`You could read it like it's telling you to continue with the remaining characters after the first six characters are removed." `
`"In other words, on the first twilight, we take a list of characters that's longer than six, `
`"kill" the six that are the key, `
`and then do something with the characters that remain...!" `
`".........That's right. `
`But, like Kyrie said, `
`what should we kill the characters from? `
`...We don't know this longer string of characters that we're supposed to be killing from." `
`On the first twilight, kill the six characters that are the key. `
`............On the first twilight. `
`"...In other words, ...by the time we reach the first twilight, some string of characters already exists? `
`That might be a set of Japanese characters, `
`but knowing Grandfather's tastes, could it be something in English? `
`"The first twilight" has more than six characters, `
`even though the Japanese phrase has just four ({p:0:第一の晩}). `
`........." `
`"......<Good>. `
`That idea of yours isn't bad, Battler-san. `
`...We can interpret the six sacrifices chosen by the key as a string of six characters. `
`I think it's a very clever concept. `
`That way, the key doesn't necessarily have to be key-shaped." `
`"I've also considered the possibility that it's an anagram." `
`"...Come to think of it, you did say something like that before. `
`But in that case, where do we take the six characters out from?" `
`"That's right. `
`...Since we're taking six characters out, it must be at least six characters long. `
`We need to read {p:0:第一の晩} in some way that gives it more than six characters..." `
`"If we follow Father's sensibilities, ...I guess it probably is English after all..." `
`"......If it looks like we're getting stuck, why don't we move on to the second twilight and look for hints? `
`...Those who remain shall tear apart the two who are close. `
`...We can probably think of "those who remain" as "the remaining characters after the first six have been taken out"." `
`"In that case, ...what does it mean by two characters that are close...?" `
`"......I see. `
`...I get it, so that's what this is about...!" `
`For example, let's take the following list of nine characters: 123456789. `
`And then, let's say that the six characters offered as sacrifices are 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9. `
`In this case, we erase the aforementioned six characters from 123456789...and get x2x45xxxx. `
`"So 2, 4, and 5 are left. `
`...So what?" `
`"...Oh, ...4 and 5 are close..." `
`"Y-Yeah, I get it!! `
`So the two who are close are..." `
`{a:c:x2x45xxxx}. `
`"Yep. `
`There's a gap between 2 and 4, but 4 and 5 are right next to each other. `
`They're the two who are close...!" `
`"......<Good>. `
`Well done, Battler-san. `
`We can't tell whether "tear apart" means to crush 4 and 5, `
`or to put a gap between them, but I think that's a good observation." `
`"Then what do you think about the third twilight, "those who remain shall praise my noble name"?" `
`"......Since there's a good chance that we're playing with letters, this might be the same thing. `
`..."The characters that remain shall praise my noble name"." `
`"Hmmmmm... `
`That's tough... `
`...What could it mean...?" `
`"......Does anyone know? `
`......I think I do." `
`"Huh? `
`What is it? Tell me...!" `
`"...Is this also...an anagram?" `
`"......Once again, <good>. `
`...Battler-san, you're a pretty flexible thinker." `
`"By anagram, you mean playing with letters, right? `
`...That means..." `
`"In other words, maybe you can make some kind of word by changing the order of the remaining letters." `
`"Yeah. `
`...If so, ......... `
`...I might be getting ahead of myself with this theory, `
`...but maybe the original list of characters that the first twilight's removed from is 11 characters long." `
`"......Well done again. `
`I reached the same conclusion." `
`"Wh-Why's that? `
`Why do you think there are 11 characters?!" `
`"......We think "killing a single sacrifice" means "crushing a single character". `
`If we interpret the "tear apart" of the second twilight to mean adding a gap between two characters, then there are 11 characters total. `
`If "tear apart" means to crush those two characters, then we can assume that there are 13 characters." `
`"...After all, from the fourth twilight to the eighth twilight, the word "kill" appears five times. `
`And then, on the ninth twilight, it's written that none will be left alive." `
`"If we ignore the part about the witch reviving for now, `
`I figured that after crushing the first six, separating the characters that are close, and then crushing five more of them, `
`...there should be no characters left." `
`So that makes 6+5, or 11 characters. `
`If tearing apart the two who are close in the second twilight means to kill both of them, `
`that makes 6+2+5, or 13 characters. `
`There's a chance the word symbolizing the first twilight has 11 or 13 characters. ......Wait, ...it couldn't be that easy, could it? `
`"......Wonderfully done. That's the exact same theory I thought of. `
`...It looks like you were gifted with excellent little gray cells just like me, Battler-san." `
`"Hey, quit it. `
`Just doing what comes naturally." `
`".........Hey, what the hell? `
`...The piece me's pretty damn smart. `
`There's no room left for me to make theories." `
`"Oh, sorry about that. `
`...You weren't around at this point, so I just controlled your piece for you. `
`......Isn't it nice how smart I made you look...?" `
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*...! `
`You look smarter when Bern's playing you. `
`...Why not step down as the player and concentrate on being a piece instead?" `
`I joined in on this game partway through, well after the first murders occurred on October 5th. `
`That means the piece called "me" was controlled by the player, {f:5:Bernkastel}. `
`So, I guess that means it's possible for {f:5:Bernkastel}'s reasoning to be announced through "my" mouth... `
`...The game I'm watching now is nothing more than a replay of a part that's already ended. `
`However, that's probably good enough for now. `
`...After all, this {f:5:Bernkastel}-sama's going out of her way to solve the epitaph for me. `
`...I'll watch closely for now. `
`......And, ...I'll try to find out what it means. `
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} let it slip herself just a second ago. `
`"Well duh. `
`If I told you that, there'd be too many hints. `
`...If it wasn't a hard riddle, {i:there'd be no point to it}. `
`...Uh-oh, that's a hint too. *giggle*..." `
`...This theory about Grandfather creating the epitaph in order to choose a successor isn't bad at all. `
`Erika and {f:5:Bernkastel}'s logic is extremely reasonable. `
`But that's only if we assume Grandfather was the one to create it. `
`He was probably alive at the time the epitaph was displayed, `
`but of course, ...Grandfather is already dead by 1986. `
`And, in the games up until now, {f:5:Beatrice} threatened us repeatedly with letters, saying that the only way to survive was to solve the epitaph... `
`and trying to force us to solve the riddle. `
`In other words, ...it was {f:5:Beatrice}'s intention--her hope--that we would try solving the riddle of the epitaph. `
`The epitaph's so confusing that, in most cases, `
`the relatives never seriously tried solving it until the threatening letters started to arrive. `
`That's why {f:5:Beatrice} fired the starting pistol that made us take a go at it. `
`............ `
`......Why is {f:5:Beatrice} carrying out Grandfather's will after his death...? `
`Like the theory proposed in the first game, ...is {f:5:Beatrice} really Grandfather's confidant, `
`who's following his orders even after his death and trying to select the Successor with the riddle of the epitaph in Grandfather's stead...? `
`If she did that, it would mean {f:5:Beatrice} really was Kinzo's trusted underling, `
`...the family alchemist she claimed to be in that letter... `
`After Grandfather's death, {f:5:Beatrice} managed the 10 tons of gold and took the title of alchemist. `
`......She was entrusted with the epitaph's riddle, and without ever embezzling the gold, `
`she waited for a human fitting to be the Successor to appear and solve it... `
`And if that human didn't appear within a set time limit, `
`...would that be "game over"? `
`Certainly, Aunt Eva, who solved the riddle in the 3rd game, `
`became the only survivor and, automatically, the final Head of the Ushiromiya family, inheriting everything. `
`Up until now, no one has ever survived past October 5th except Aunt Eva, the one who solved the epitaph... `
`That was the only case where {f:5:Beatrice} let anyone survive... `
`............... `
`Is {f:5:Beatrice}'s loyalty to Grandfather...the thing that drove her......? `
`Was she so loyal that she faithfully carried out some terrible order... `
`to kill everyone if the epitaph wasn't solved...? `
`......... `
`...I must not stop thinking. `
`...Don't...stop thinking... `
`Don't just think of the riddle itself, ...think about why it's significant. `
`............ `
`Why is {f:5:Beatrice} telling us to solve the epitaph...? `
`Why is she making us solve such a {i:confusing} epitaph...? `
`...If {f:5:Beatrice} makes us try and solve this epitaph we have no real chance of solving, `
`......and by some lucky chance, a "miracle" occurs and someone is able to solve it, `
`...what significance would that have to her......? `
`I don't know...what such a miracle would be worth to Beato. `
`"Anyway, ...until we figure out the first twilight, we'll have to give up on the rest." `
`We tried looking at it from several different angles, but in the end, we got stuck there and made no further advances. `
`"Mmph, ...fwaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh..." `
`Maria let out an extra-large yawn. `
`This caused several other people to yawn. `
`...We'd been using our heads so much that everyone had gotten a little sleepy. `
`Jessica, who'd been silent and irritated the whole time, quickly stood up. `
`"...I'm going upstairs with Maria. `
`We'll watch TV or something." `
`"Okay... `
`I'll go up too. `
`Hey, why don't we all play cards upstairs?" `
`When George proposed this, Maria completely forgot about that big yawn of hers and started jumping around, insisting that she wanted to play cards. `
`According to the clock, it was already 10:00 at night. `
`It was already about the time you'd normally take a bath and get ready for sleep. `
`Even the adults seemed pretty weary from traveling. `
`We decided to continue this later and went our separate ways... `
`"Will you play cards with us too, `
`Erika-chan?" `
`"......I appreciate the sentiment. `
`I overstepped my bounds a little, forgetting that I'm a simple guest. `
`I'd like to take it easy and rest for the night. `
`......I almost forgot I was recently in an accident." `
`"Seriously. `
`You're in such high spirits, it's hard to believe you almost drowned." `
`"*giggle* `
`That's youth for you. `
`Still, I enjoyed it. `
`I think we've taken a big step in our reasoning thanks to you. `
`If I find the gold, I'll let you have about a million yen worth." `
`"Wahahaha! `
`Can't you at least offer the poor girl a hundred million! `
`Gahahaha!" `
`"No need to bother. `
`I'm only interested in solving the riddle. `
`...Well then, if you'll excuse me. `
`...Good night." `
`"Yeah, 'night." `
`"Oh, you aren't going upstairs, Battler-kun?" `
`"...I'm getting a bit interested. `
`I'll think things through here just a bit longer. `
`If I can just figure out the list of characters that marks the first twilight, I bet the road before me will open up all at once..." `
`Everyone went up to the second floor, one by one. `
`Only Aunt Rosa remained behind, cleaning up the coffee cups everyone had been drinking out of. `
`Kyrie-san and some others had offered to help, `
`but Rosa had refused and was washing them all alone. `
`Since I'd just been treated to such delicious coffee, I decided to help too. `
`...I wasn't just doing it because I felt obligated. `
`I wanted to keep discussing the epitaph with someone. `
`"......The first twilight, ...the first twilight. `
`...Hmmmm. `
`Aunt Rosa, have you thought of some list of characters or a word?" `
`"No... `
`I don't have a clue. `
`......But instead of the first twilight, it's the tenth twilight that bugs me." `
`"The tenth twilight...? `
`What about it?" `
`"Well, `
`......at the end here, it says you'll receive the Golden Land's four treasures "once and for the last time", right?" `
`"Yeah, it does." `
`"Why mention that you're reaching the Golden Land just once, and then say it's for the last time? `
`It's almost as though he's repeating the same thing twice. `
`I've just been wondering whether he had some reason for putting it like that." `
`".........You're right. `
`...Like you said, `
`there's got to be a more straightforward way of saying that." `
`That line should've been a key part of the riddle, `
`where you wouldn't expect the writer to waste words needlessly... `
`Could it have been done for some special purpose...? `
`............... `
`"Still, ...you and that Erika-chan girl are incredible. `
`Your minds really are flexible. `
`...I'm already an old lady, and my brain just doesn't work that fast. `
`That theory about the six chosen by the key signifying six characters to be removed was very impressive." `
`"After hearing that, I can't see it as being any other way, `
`but before then, I didn't think it was like that at all... `
`I'm feeling let down by my own dull mind." `
`"That's not true. `
`You've got a flexible mind yourself, Aunt Rosa. `
`This "last time" thing might be really important somewhere down the line." `
`"Not at all. My mind's very stiff. `
`......Up until now, I've always thought that this "first twilight" was nothing more than a place one-tenth of the way on a road to the Golden Land." `
`"...What's that? `
`Sounds interesting. Mind telling me about it?" `
`"*giggle* `
`...After all, in the line before the first twilight, it says "you must travel to the Golden Land", right? `
`The next part describes a journey that lasts ten days, so I thought the first twilight would be part of the way through that journey." `
`"...A journey... `
`......I see. `
`........." `
`"Then the journey begins, and when you set up camp at the first twilight, you offer the six as sacrifices. `
`......So I thought, where is that place? `
`How many kilometers from the starting point...? `
`Things like that... `
`Don't tell anyone this, okay? `
`I'm not very clever, so for a long time I read the "Home" kanji ({p:0:郷}) as "kyou" when it's probably "sato"." `
`"......And "kyou" reminds you of Kyoto ({ruby:kyouto:{p:0:京都}}), right? It's often shortened to "kyou" ({p:0:京}). `
`So I thought the ten‐day trip might be between Father's home and Kyoto, and there might be something hidden one‐tenth of the way there..." `
`"Are you kidding? That's a brilliant idea. `
`......And the first twilight is the first stop on that ten-day journey... `
`...The name of that place might be the key to moving forward..." `
`"For my ten day theory to work, you'd have to know both the start point and the end point. `
`...I know the start point. `
`I know the hometown Father loved. `
`The place Father spent his time when he was a boy really is far away." `
`"...But the problem is the goal, ...the Golden Land. `
`What does that really mean? `
`...If we don't know that, my theory gets us nowhere. `
`I've been stuck at this spot for a long time, `
`but after listening to your reasoning today, I've realized what an embarrassing mistake I've been making." `
`"......No, ...I think that's still an interesting idea. `
`............... `
`A start and a goal, a ten-day journey. `
`...And the place reached at the very first twilight..." `
`"Believe it or not, I think you might solve this one easily, Battler-kun. `
`...If you do solve it with your aunt's hint, share some with me. Even 5% would be great. `
`It's a promise{p:0:♪}" `
`Despite being my aunt, she gave me a smile and a wink which would've made a man's heart jump. `
`As I helped her wash the coffee cups, `
`...I kept pondering the epitaph's riddle in silence...... `
`...After I finished helping Aunt Rosa, I passed through the corridor on my way to the bathroom... `
`and saw Erika unlocking the door to a room on my path. `
`"...I thought your room was on the second floor? `
`Figured you'd gone upstairs and had fallen asleep by now." `
`".........I was just searching for something. `
`...I thought it might be here." `
`"Searching for something...?" `
`Erika unlocked the door and opened it. `
`A dusty smell drifted out... `
`It was the library. `
`For a library, the gaps between bookshelves were extremely small. `
`This was obviously built for storing books, not reading them. `
`"...So, it's a book you're searching for." `
`"Not necessarily a book, ...but materials, I guess you could say. `
`There's something I've just got to look up." `
`".........You're looking for something to do with the epitaph's riddle...? `
`Pretty impressive that you haven't given up yet. `
`Is the 20 billion yen that enticing?" `
`I hadn't given up either. `
`Apparently, being stubborn is something we both share... `
`"Of course not. `
`...I'm only interested in solving puzzles. `
`I search for the gold only to prove my reasoning correct. `
`Even if I found it, I wouldn't pocket it for myself, so have no fears on that score." `
`...She immediately cast my comment aside, saying that she just liked solving riddles and had no interest at all in the gold. `
`I've thought she was pretty weird from the start, and it looks like that impression was spot on. `
`Erika slowly circled the bookshelves, searching for the book she was after... `
`"I'm also trying to solve the epitaph right now. `
`......Oh yeah, just a second ago, I heard something interesting from Aunt Rosa, which might give us a hint about the first twilight." `
`"......Let me hear it." `
`Erika asked this without stopping her search, or even turning to face me. `
`"In the line before the first twilight, it says that one who obtains the key must do so and so." `
`"......The one who obtains the key must then travel to the Golden Land in accordance with these rules." `
`"Whoa... `
`You've already got it memorized? `
`Guess I shouldn't be surprised..." `
`"And what about that?" `
`"...Yeah. `
`You've gotta travel to the Golden Land, right? `
`Apparently, this made Aunt Rosa think about the tenth twilight... `
`in other words, going on a ten-day journey from the beloved homeland to the Golden Land..." `
`"Actually, I'd already noticed that myself. `
`You start from the place reached on the first day of the ten-day journey. `
`...That's where you take the sacrifices from." `
`"Y-Yeah, that's what Aunt Rosa thought of too. `
`I think the theory's pretty intriguing. `
`...We're looking for the place you'd reach on the first day of a ten-day journey. `
`That bit of land--or else the name of that region--might be a key..." `
`"......I also guessed that the place's name might be a key. `
`That's why I'm looking for materials. `
`I want to turn my guess into certainty." `
`"Just what......are you looking for?" `
`Then, Erika's hand suddenly stopped, ...and she slowly pulled it out... `
`As she dusted it off, she finally looked at me and spoke. `
`"It's an atlas." `
