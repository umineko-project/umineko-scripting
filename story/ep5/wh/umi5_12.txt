`In the Golden Land, the quiet rain...just kept on falling. `
`In the arbor...sat the sad witch whose eyes had lost their glint...and Battler. `
`Virgilia could also be seen there. `
`...She sat next to Beato, knitting quietly. `
`Lambdadelta's game had passed the climax of the first twilight, and they were taking a short break. `
`Gazing out at the golden rose garden soaked with rain, `
`...Battler considered the present, what was to come, and what had happened so far... `
`To Battler, the act of thinking was itself a battle. `
`Even with the game stopped and Beato unable to speak, ...he could still keep on fighting. `
`...Virgilia suddenly stopped her knitting. `
`Battler noticed it too. `
`...Because, though none should have been able to visit this rose garden, she had noticed a silhouette approaching. `
`"......That's unusual. `
`Not many people are capable of reaching this place." `
`"It's her........." `
`That silhouette, ...which walked amidst the quietly falling rain without so much as an umbrella, `
`......was Dlanor. `
`"...That was a spectacular garden {f:5:maze}. `
`A splendid way to enjoy the {f:5:roses}." `
`"Why......are you here?" `
`"It's been some time, <Mrs> Beatrice. `
`...No wait, now it's <Mrs> Virgilia, is it {f:5:not}?" `
`"Long time no see, Dlanor. `
`...Come over here. `
`We aren't ones to leave a guest out in the rain." `
`"..............." `
`"Don't worry. `
`She hasn't come to fight." `
`"...Do you know her?" `
`"She's one of my old friends from heaven. `
`...This really takes me back." `
`"That it {f:5:does}. `
`<Mrs> Virgilia possesses a deep knowledge in Heavenly {f:5:Studies}. `
`I have often argued with her over {f:5:interpretations}." `
`"Ho ho ho... `
`My many intellectual adventures with you were quite enjoyable. `
`I'd like to do it again sometime." `
`"Yes. `
`Let's do it again {f:5:sometime}. `
`I'd love to fight with you {f:5:again}." `
`They used the word "fight", but it didn't sound like they meant anything unpleasant by it. `
`It sounded like something old chess rivals would say to each other. `
`Unlike Beato, it seems Virgilia always behaved properly and courteously, `
`so she had many friends in various other worlds, including both heaven and the demon world. `
`Surprisingly, Dlanor was one of them...... `
`Dlanor, who had crossed swords with "me" just a short while ago, `
`ducked her head like someone taking shelter from a sudden rain and sat in the seat Virgilia pointed out, like a guest. `
`"...Is there any type of black tea you would prefer?" `
`"{f:5:Anything}. `
`...Any tea you make is {f:5:superb}." `
`"Then how about some Darjeeling? `
`...Battler, Beato, would you like some more?" `
`"...Yeah. `
`Beato and I would like a refill. `
`...Right?" `
`"..............." `
`As usual, Beato didn't answer, `
`...but if you quietly gave her a cup, she would sip it from time to time. `
`There was still some black tea left in that cup, but it had already chilled. `
`So Battler asked for a refill for Beato as well... `
`"...I have heard the {f:5:rumors}. `
`...How pitiable that Beatrice, the Endless Witch famous for her cruelty, `
`has been reduced to {f:5:this}." `
`"She's no longer participating in the game. `
`...Lambdadelta is the one controlling the Beato that's on the game board." `
`"I {f:5:know}. `
`...However, she is the original master of this {f:5:world}. `
`And you are the proper guest, invited by that {f:5:master}. `
`That is why I have come to pay my {f:5:respects}." `
`On the game board, Beato and I met Dlanor. `
`But those were the game pieces of those witches. `
`They weren't Beato and me ourselves. `
`"Is that why you went out of your way to greet Battler-kun and Beato here...? `
`...I see you're as conscientious as ever." `
`"That is my way of doing {f:5:things}. `
`......Greetings, <Mister> Battler. `
`I am Dlanor A. Knox. `
`...We play opposing roles, but it is a pleasure to meet {f:5:you}." `
`"...Sure. `
`I'm Ushiromiya Battler. `
`Pleased to meet you." `
`"Greetings, <Miss> Beatrice. `
`I am Dlanor A. Knox." `
`"..............." `
`"...Beato, `
`she's saying hi. `
`........." `
`"............" `
`"......... `
`...She says "welcome"." `
`"Thank you very {f:5:much}, `
`<Miss> Beatrice." `
`The witch and the Inquisitor of Heresy, whose job it was to hunt witches, `
`greeted each other around a tea table surrounded by the aroma of black tea. `
`...It was a strange sight. `
`Virgilia made gold butterflies sprout from the palms of her hands `
`and transformed them into a teapot and a can of tea leaves. `
`...It was a very witch-like way to make tea. `
`Of course, she actually was a witch, so that scene wasn't particularly bizarre in itself. `
`...Though I was a bit concerned about whether Dlanor, an Inquisitor of Heresy, could watch such a spectacle. `
`"...Do not {f:5:worry}. `
`I am not so boorish as to complain about how my tea is {f:5:served}." `
`"Even though the tea's being made with magic...?" `
`"...There is a tea set hiding in the shadows, and <Mrs> Virgilia is making us tea with it in {f:5:secret}. `
`We interpret or judge that it was "made with {f:5:magic}", and it is written as such in the {f:5:tale}. `
`...That interpretation is allowed by Knox's 9{f:5:th}." `
`"Oh my... `
`I do believe the interpretation of the 9th is such a delicate problem that it's viewed as a taboo, even in the Great Court... `
`Even though it's just a personal opinion, if it became known that the Head Inquisitor of Heresy said such a thing, you might be sacked." `
`"No matter what interpretation I record it with, `
`there are no lies in the taste of your {f:5:tea}. `
`Therefore, I do not worry about how it was {f:5:prepared}." `
`".........Aha..." `
`Though she looked cold, ...she was a surprisingly tactful person. `
`...If Dlanor were to deny that the black tea had been prepared with magic, this magic would surely be crushed in a instant. `
`However, the possibility had been presented that a tea set existed and had been used to make the tea normally, `
`so the fact that Virgilia had made tea was, in the end, undisputed. `
`"Magic that hides the result in darkness is {f:5:evil}. `
`I will not permit {f:5:it}. `
`However, magic that enshrouds the process is not necessarily {f:5:evil}. `
`My foe is evil itself, not {f:5:magic}." `
`"I see. `
`...The important thing is that you're being served some tea, `
`so it's just common courtesy to avoid complaining about how it was made." `
`...That's right. `
`When someone makes tea for you, it's common courtesy to be grateful. `
`There's nothing elegant about pushing your way into the kitchen and criticizing how they brew it. `
`"You don't invite your guests into the kitchen. `
`And when you set the table, you should adorn it beautifully in the spirit of hospitality. `
`...Here you go. Careful, it's hot." `
`"Thank {f:5:you}. `
`I would like some sugar and {f:5:milk}." `
`"*giggle* `
`You still can't drink it straight?" `
`"I'm a {f:5:kid}. `
`It must be {f:5:sweet}." `
`"......So then, `
`...is magic... `
`a gentle... `
`...lie?" `
`"The word "lie" makes it sound bad. `
`The word "embellishment" is probably more fitting." `
`"When giving a child candy, `
`you can take a crumpled up one out of your pocket, `
`or you can use some clever sleight of hand to take the candy {f:5:out}. The impression given by each method varies {f:5:greatly}." `
`"Well yeah, it'd look cooler if you took it out with a little magic trick." `
`"{f:5:Wrong}. `
`There is meaning in the fact that the result--giving them candy--has been adorned to be even more beautiful and {f:5:fun}." `
`"...Think of when you give Maria-chan a candy. `
`There's a huge difference between taking it out of your pocket to give to her... `
`and slipping it into her pocket `
`and saying a fairy gave it to her for being such a good girl." `
`"In my opinion, it would be boorish to then question everyone about their alibis `
`and pinpoint who it was that slipped it into her {f:5:pocket}. `
`The important thing is the result: that the girl received the candy and {f:5:rejoiced}. `
`And it is significant that it was embellished in a way that made her {f:5:rejoice}." `
`"...That's surprising. `
`When you showed up, I got the feeling you'd deny anything that went by the name of magic." `
`"That is how I act in my capacity as an Inquisitor of {f:5:Heresy}. `
`It is my {f:5:job}. `
`However, when I am away from my job, I don't enjoy being quite so cold-{f:5:hearted}." `
`"So, you set your personal feelings aside when on duty? `
`...You do it well." `
`"As an Inquisitor of Heresy, hunting witches is my {f:5:job}. `
`...However, I personally find witches {f:5:pitiable}. `
`Despite this, I carry out judgment mercilessly as an {f:5:Inquisitor}." `
`"...In the end, that doesn't change the fact that I sentence witches to {f:5:death}. `
`...In the end, my pity is nothing more than a useless {f:5:embellishment}. `
`Whether I have it or not, nothing {f:5:changes}. `
`So, it would be better if I {f:5:didn't}..." `
`"......That's not true. `
`Even if the ends are the same, what's in your heart makes a big difference." `
`"...Your mother's cookies are clearly more delicious than those made by a good pastry shop. `
`...That's because you know that they were made with heart." `
`"That's right. `
`......Even if the result looks the same, `
`...whether or not there's warmth behind the feelings of whoever gave it to you makes a big difference..." `
`"Is that {f:5:so}...? `
`.........Whether I have a heart or not is completely {f:5:meaningless}." `
`Dlanor's gaze fell to her cup, a little sadly... `
`"That's not true." `
`"........." `
`"After hearing all this, I've changed my view of you a bit. `
`...And that's why I'm certain the heart isn't meaningless." `
`Virgilia was a little surprised to hear the words she should have said coming from Battler's mouth. `
`After all, understanding the "heart" is the first step towards finding the essence of magic. `
`By now, ...perhaps Battler has unconsciously started to understand, bit by bit, `
`...the essence of Beato, the essence of witches... `
`and the very first essence of all, ...magic. `
`Whether you want to become a witch or vanquish them... `
`...The very first step is learning about magic. `
`Virgilia was sure that she'd felt this faint change within Battler... `
`"...As for that last fight, thank you very {f:5:much}. `
`I am grateful for the mercy you showed me at the very {f:5:end}." `
`"That "me" wasn't me. `
`...Lambdadelta was controlling him." `
`I joined in on the 5th game partway through. `
`I still haven't participated "at this point in time". `
`So until I do join in, `
`the piece "me" is probably being controlled by Bernkastel or Lambdadelta. `
`"...Just what kind of whim's guiding them? `
`Trying to make it look all cool... `
`They made me look like some kind of knight coming to save Beato." `
`"Lady Lambdadelta wants both witches and Humans to be in balance, resulting in a draw. `
`......With Erika's appearance, the scales tipped strongly in the favor of the Human side, `
`so she manipulated the tale in a way that supports Beato." `
`"I am aware of {f:5:that}. `
`However, pieces cannot do things that are impossible for {f:5:them}. `
`And they specialize in actions appropriate to their original {f:5:personality}. `
`...Therefore, that was certainly something that you...that Battler was capable {f:5:of}. `
`That is why I am grateful to {f:5:you}." `
`"...It feels a bit weird to be praised when I didn't actually do anything. `
`...After the game continues a bit more, I'll probably regain control of my piece. `
`Not sure I'll be able to go easy on you then." `
`"It's the same with {f:5:me}. `
`The next time we cross swords, I won't hold {f:5:back}." `
`"Bring it on. I'll be your opponent. `
`Come at me with all you've got." `
`"I {f:5:promise}. With everything I've {f:5:got}." `
`...Dlanor, huh? `
`I'd thought she was an emotionless killer doll without a heart, `
`...but maybe she actually is pretty approachable. `
`...Though of course, neither of us will show any mercy when fighting on the game board. `
`For a while, we gazed at the rain-drenched rose garden as we quietly enjoyed our tea. `
`"......There is one thing I must apologize {f:5:for}." `
`With a sudden sigh, Dlanor muttered something. `
`"What is it? `
`...If it's about that fight a short while ago, it's already over. `
`We both fought with everything we had. `
`The outcome was just luck of the draw." `
`"No, it wasn't luck of the {f:5:draw}. `
`...I couldn't just let it be, so I came here to {f:5:apologize}." `
`"...What are you talking about...?" `
`"......... `
`......You're saying you threw the match, aren't you?" `
`Virgilia spoke softly, without hesitating in her knitting. `
`"......That is {f:5:correct}, `
`...<Mister> Battler." `
`"That <Mister>'s really awkward. `
`Just Battler works fine." `
`"Battler, `
`...I {f:5:apologize}. `
`We did not give it everything we {f:5:had}." `
`"......I know. `
`......{p:1:‘Kinzo is dead at the starting time for all games’}. `
`Beato has already spoken that truth. `
`...In that battle, Battler-kun could only have achieved a draw at best. `
`He most certainly had no chance at all of winning." `
`"...You're right. `
`...If you just say that, the whole fight's already over. `
`...Why didn't you use that red? `
`Don't tell me it was because of a stalemate or something like that." `
`"{p:1:Knox's 2nd: `
`It is forbidden for supernatural agencies to be employed as a detective {f:5:technique}}. `
`We cannot use that red truth {f:5:directly}. `
`However, I gave Cornelia, who was protecting the window, `
`the red truth that "{p:1:the window was never opened after it started {f:5:raining}}"." `
`"Boom. `
`...That's checkmate. `
`......Why didn't that girl use that trump card...?" `
`".........!! `
`Th-This is.........agh. `
`A-Allow me to speak...! `
`There is no way to defeat my red! `
`Know that your wish will not be granted...!!" `
`Though she had fought calmly up until that point, `
`...she quickly got flustered when I dashed forwards. `
`I'd thought she'd been frightened by my sudden attack, ...but the truth was different. `
`Even though she held a trump card that could completely repel me, `
`......she suddenly became unable to use it, and hesitated. `
`"I don't {f:5:understand}. `
`All of a sudden, in that instant, use of that trump card became {f:5:forbidden}. `
`Once we lost that, your victory was {f:5:guaranteed}." `
`"......The Game Master, Lady Lambdadelta, probably interfered." `
`"That bastard... `
`......So in the end, that whole fight was a farce in the palm of Lambdadelta's hand. `
`She made "us" play out that entire act according to her script." `
`"I do not like {f:5:it}. `
`However, since you told me to fight with everything I had, I had no choice but to let you {f:5:know}. `
`...Please forgive {f:5:me}." `
`"Still, even though you lost your trump card, you kept on fighting all-out with your remaining cards. `
`I don't believe anyone could find fault with what you did." `
`"...That's right. `
`...On the contrary, you should be mad at Lambdadelta for butting in." `
`"{p:1:‘Kinzo does not exist’} should already be an established {f:5:fact}. `
`Lady Lambdadelta and Lady Bernkastel should know this {f:5:well}. `
`And yet, they are both leaving room for Kinzo to exist as they continue in this {f:5:game}. `
`...It's almost as though the two are conspiring to prevent Kinzo's existence from being {f:5:denied}." `
`"In other words, they intentionally let "Grandfather" escape...?" `
`"{f:5:Yes}. `
`They must be after {f:5:something}." `
`".........That is a bit odd. `
`...Lady Lambdadelta and Lady Bernkastel should always be in opposition, unless the witch side is in a superior position. `
`...It's hard to imagine that those two are conspiring together at a time like this..." `
`"I can't help but think that they have some sort of wicked {f:5:goal}. `
`I came here because I wanted you to know {f:5:that}." `
`"...So, ...you came all the way here to tell us something like that?" `
`"{f:5:Yes}. `
`...Which means that my business here is {f:5:finished}. `
`I think I will leave {f:5:now}. `
`The game will probably resume {f:5:shortly}. `
`I must aid Erika during the rest of this {f:5:game}." `
`Dlanor gulped down the last of her black tea and stood up. `
`"Next is the battle of the second {f:5:twilight}. `
`At that point, I will once again raise my merciless {f:5:longsword}. `
`...So I ask the same of {f:5:you}, Battler. `
`Show no mercy towards {f:5:me}." `
`"...I understand. `
`...If I went easy on you, I'd have my own head smashed in." `
`"On the game board, I am nothing more than Lady Bernkastel's piece and Furudo Erika's {f:5:subordinate}. `
`In the future, we will probably stand across from each other as opponents many {f:5:times}. `
`...However, my heart is always {f:5:neutral}. `
`...No, ...please forget {f:5:that}. `
`...Such has no meaning considering the relationship between the two of {f:5:us}." `
`"It does. `
`...There's no doubt you're a fearsome opponent, but you don't piss me off anymore. `
`Though that Erika totally pisses me off." `
`"{f:5:Good}. `
`Furudo Erika also pisses me {f:5:off}." `
`"Heh, hahahahaha." `
`Dlanor's expression finally softened slightly. `
`...At the very last moment, it felt as though we finally understood each other. `
`"Furudo Erika is a very evil {f:5:entity}. `
`...She's lost face with her recent defeat and is burning with a desire for {f:5:revenge}. `
`Even I don't know what she is {f:5:planning}. `
`However, it can't be anything {f:5:good}. `
`Please take {f:5:care}." `
`"...Just knowing she's Bernkastel's piece tells me I can't let my guard down." `
`Dlanor nodded as though satisfied, left the overhang of the arbor and walked out into the rain. `
`"...To think I'd serve as a subordinate to such {f:5:evil}... `
`......Why was I called to this {f:5:world}?" `
`Dlanor let out a small sigh. `
`"Pieces" can do nothing except fulfill the function they have been given. `
`And that function is given to them by the one who controls them. `
`...She probably can't disobey "her" own player, Bernkastel. `
`".........Lady Bernkastel may be the one who called you here. `
`However, the one who let you into this world is Beato. `
`...If this child didn't wish it, you would never have been able to make it through the garden maze and arrive here. `
`...Right, ...Beato...?" `
`"..............." `
`"......... `
`...<Miss> Beatrice, `
`what is it that you want from {f:5:me}? `
`...I do hope that I can help you in some way, though I may be a subordinate of {f:5:evil}..." `
`She spoke to Beato...but of course, there was no response. `
`After bowing once more in thanks for the black tea, `
`...Dlanor disappeared off into the rainy rose garden... `
`"So, no one can reach this Golden Land if Beato doesn't want them to?" `
`"Yes. `
`...This child is the one who called Dlanor here." `
`"............" `
`"......So, ...Beato called her here so I could meet with her..." `
`...However, `
`I know of a person who reached this place despite Beato's wishes. `
`It's Ange. `
`...In the last game, Ange reached this place by herself, `
`...even though she was an uninvited guest. `
`Was that... `
`...also something... `
`...Beato wished for...? `
`"I am here, you are here. `
`Beato is here. `
`Dlanor was invited here. `
`...All of these things happened because this child wanted them to. `
`...Even the bit of time you and Dlanor spent together drinking tea." `
`"............" `
`"...Beato, `
`what was I......supposed to learn from her...? `
`Does it have something to do with finding your heart...and letting you rest in peace...?" `
`Dlanor A. Knox. `
`The natural enemy of witches. `
`An Inquisitor of Heresy. `
`...A vanguard of mystery...who denies fantasy. `
`Is she here to help... `
`...by gouging out your heart... `
`...and choking the life out of you......? `
`............... `
`"Please stand. `
`On one leg." `
`"............" `
`Cornelia slowly got up and stood on one leg, as she had been ordered. `
`Her hands were clasped behind her back. `
`...Because she had been ordered to do so. `
`Then, with a *thump*, `
`Erika pushed her from behind with both hands. `
`Cornelia landed on the floor face first with a *thud*. `
`"Please stand. `
`On one leg." `
`"............" `
`Cornelia rose shakily. `
`Then, once again, she stood on one leg as she had been ordered. `
`She had been ordered not to hold her ground. `
`So she had fallen on her face over and over again. `
`She had barely managed to protect her nose, but after smashing against the floor so many times, her face was bright red. `
`She wasn't shedding any tears. `
`No, she couldn't shed them. `
`Because she was forbidden to do even that... `
`"Please stand. `
`On one leg." `
`"............" `
`*thump* `
`*thud*. `
`"Please stand. `
`On one leg." `
`*thump* `
`*thud*. `
`*thump* `
`*thud*. `
`*thump* `
`.........*thud*. `
`Erika repeated this falling torture over and over again. `
`At times like this, Erika hated counting things. `
`So she decided that, once she ran out of fingers to count the number of times, she would just repeat it until she lost interest. `
`However, Erika's main redeeming feature was that she never lost interest in anything, `
`so the torture continued on and on... `
`...Erika didn't know `
`why Cornelia had been unable to fully protect the window. `
`So the whole time since then, `
`...she had placed all the blame of their loss on her. `
`"...Please, allow me to speak. `
`Forgive Cornelia. `
`She has already repented enough..." `
`"Oh, is that true? `
`Then please take her place from now on." `
`"...G-Gertrude has done nothing wrong..." `
`"Gertrude, `
`......please stand. `
`On one leg. `
`Clasp your hands behind you." `
`"............" `
`Gertrude followed the order... `
`...and clasped her hands behind her back, standing on one leg. `
`"You mustn't resist or hold your ground. `
`You are not permitted to bend your knees. `
`You are not permitted to shed any tears. `
`Got it?" `
`"......As you wish..." `
`"Gertrude........." `
`Erika made a show of walking behind Gertrude. `
`She even enjoyed making her wonder when she'd push... `
`At that time, Gertrude and Cornelia burst with a bright light and disappeared. `
`...Because Dlanor, who must have returned at some point, had sent them back to the heavens for the time being. `
`Erika, who'd had her fun spoiled, gave Dlanor an openly malicious look... `
`"<Miss> Erika, `
`I will bear the punishment for all my subordinates' faults, as their {f:5:superior}. `
`I ask that you let them {f:5:go}." `
`"......<No, thank you>. `
`Punishment only works because it causes pain. `
`...There's nothing interesting about an unfeeling doll girl that I can't leave a single injury on." `
`Erika slowly grabbed hold of the back of Dlanor's hair, tugging unrelentingly. `
`Dlanor's neck tilted upwards, creaking. `
`"...You may not cause a physical injury, but you do {f:5:injure}." `
`"Hmph. `
`As if you had a heart that could get injured. `
`You lowly witch-hunting murder doll. `
`......Are you trying to talk back to me? `
`Me, the envoy and double of the Great Lady Bernkastel...?!" `
`"......{f:5:No}." `
`"I got scolded by Lady Bernkastel because you guys are useless...!! `
`Never fail so lamely again...! `
`Un-der-sta-nd...?!" `
`The hair she had grabbed was stretched back as far as it would go, along with more creaking... `
`This didn't cause Dlanor any physical pain, `
`but she could clearly feel Erika's ill will. `
`"......My {f:5:apologies}. `
`Forgive {f:5:me}." `
`"Filth." `
`With a sound like a bowstring being cut, ...several of Dlanor's hairs were pulled out. `
`Then, Erika waved her hand about as though trying to brush off something dirty that had gotten stuck to it. `
`"Well, that's okay. `
`I'm done. `
`......My anger's finally settled down, and my little gray cells are tingling again. `
`...Please call those two useless people back and reconstruct the crime scene. `
`Let's start the reasoning game." `
`"{f:5:Understood}. `
`......Gertrude, Cornelia." `
`""As you wish."" `
`The two of them reappeared behind Dlanor... `
`and reconstructed the crime scene for Erika, the one who had just been tormenting them... `
`"...Kinzo's disappearance was nothing more than a bonus round after the first twilight. `
`Let's start investigating the first twilight itself. `
`...But before we do that, `
`did you realize we were actually given a riddle before the murders even occurred?" `
`"{f:5:Yes}. `
`The letter with the mark of the One-Winged Eagle, which appeared at 24:00 last night along with a knock by some {f:5:person}." `
`"That's right. `
`The tale creates the illusion that the events of that instant would be impossible for any Human, `
`making it seem like an unknown witch exists. `
`...Let's start by crushing this Illusion of the Witch. `
`We'll first check the situation in the dining hall last night when the letter was delivered." `
`"{f:5:Understood}. `
`Gertrude, Cornelia. `
`Reconstruct last night's family conference in the dining hall." `
`""As you wish."" `
`The family conference last night was held with the adult relatives and Battler. `
`And partway through, the servants had arrived to serve tea. `
`"Let's check everyone's location at the instant the letter arrived. `
`How did that go, again?" `
`"Please, allow me to speak. `
`{p:1:Before the family conference, Erika, George, Jessica, Maria, Nanjo, Gohda, and Kumasawa left the mansion and moved to the guesthouse}." `
`"Please, allow me to speak. `
`{p:1:Of those who remain, only Krauss, Natsuhi, and Genji were in the second floor corridor, `
`while all others were in the dining hall}." `
`"Because the family conference was proceeding and the mansion was completely locked, `
`all other humans were unable to enter the {f:5:mansion}." `
`"Aha. `
`That'd mean there was no one inside the mansion who could've knocked and placed the letter there, right? `
`Heheheh." `
`"{f:5:Yes}. `
`The witch side will probably claim that the one who did this...was the witch who wrote the letter, Beatrice." `
`"Ridiculous. `
`A stupid trick. `
`......There's no guarantee that the letter was placed there at exactly 24:00. `
`It's only sensible to consider that it might've been placed there earlier." `
`"Just a few minutes before the letter was discovered, Shannon and Kanon came in to serve {f:5:tea}. `
`When they entered, multiple witnesses confirmed that there was nothing suspicious like a letter in the hallway." `
`"{p:2:Most likely, one of those not in the dining hall—Krauss, Natsuhi, or Genji— `
`simply saw their chance right after that and placed the letter there}. `
`No wait, it should be possible for the people who supposedly went to the guesthouse too." `
`"{p:2:We've heard that the mansion was locked and that no one outside could get in, `
`but if someone only pretended to go to the guesthouse and instead hid inside the mansion, `
`it's perfectly possible that they could have placed the letter there}." `
`"Allow me to speak. `
`Blue truth, valid." `
`"In that case, the problem is the "{f:5:knock}". `
`Unlike the letter, someone would have to exist there at the instant of the {f:5:knock}." `
`"I see, so this is the so-called proof that a person who shouldn't be there--a witch--existed? `
`This is just so ridiculous. `
`Do they think I, Furudo Erika, would surrender to something like that? `
`*giggle*giggle*, ahhahaha!" `
`"{p:2:Firstly, I question whether the knock was even something hitting the door to the dining hall at all. `
`For example, the mansion's construction may be such that when a certain pillar on the second floor is struck, the noise is transmitted down the pillar, `
`and it sounds just like a knock on the door to people in the dining hall}." `
`"{p:2:Or they could have misheard some other random sound as a knock and misconstrued it in a similar way. `
`Or a tape with the sound of a knock recorded on it could have been secretly playing, `
`which had been carefully set up to be heard at exactly that time}." `
`"Either way, I can think of many ways to make them hear a knock, `
`even if no one was on the other side of the door...! `
`How is that? My master! `
`How is my reasoning...?!!" `
`"......That's what she says, ...so what do you think?" `
`"Well, it looks like your cute piece gave it her all thinking up these blue truths, `
`so I guess I'll be nice and give out a few reds{p:0:♪}" `
`I guess I'll start with the letter. `
`We have both the knock made when the bell of the large clock rang out 24:00... `
`And the letter sitting there in an envelope bearing the One-Winged Eagle crest when the door was opened. `
`It's so obvious to suspect that the people who weren't in the parlor secretly placed the letter there, right? `
`{p:1:Krauss, Natsuhi, and Genji did not even touch that letter}! `
`"...Oho? `
`Then, `
`{p:2:when Shannon and Kanon came in to serve tea, who was the last Human to enter the dining hall...? `
`Let's say it was Kanon. `
`Wouldn't it be easy if Kanon, the last person in, secretly dropped the letter there when he closed the door}?" `
`"{p:1:Not a single person in the dining hall—no, there's a simpler way to say it. `
`Among all those inside the mansion at midnight, `
`not a single one of them placed that letter in the hallway}." `
`"So, you can't say that no one touched it?" `
`"Obviously. `
`They "touched it when they picked it up". `
`Of course I couldn't say that none of them touched it." `
`"I see. `
`Then let's interpret it this way: `
`{p:2:Someone who existed outside of the mansion at midnight placed the letter somewhere other than the hallway beforehand. `
`Then, it moved by some means, and ended up "placed in the hallway".}" `
`"{p:2:Just as an example, let's say it was deliberately stuck to the underside of... `
`the serving cart carrying the tea set, which the servants wheeled into the room. `
`It was simply affixed there in a way that would make it come unstuck after a certain amount of time, `
`such that when it eventually fell off, it would become "the letter left by a witch who shouldn't exist". `
`In other words, this is a classic trick where the true sender gives themselves an alibi by making the letter appear at a different time}." `
`"Allow me to speak. `
`Blue truth, valid." `
`"In other words, the fact that it landed just outside the dining hall door was just the culprit's good luck. `
`At worst, it might have happened in the kitchen, the corridor, or even inside the dining hall." `
`"...Oh, <good>! `
`If it had happened inside the dining hall, that would've been even more wonderful. `
`Within everyone's sight, a letter would suddenly appear on the floor. `
`And that wouldn't even violate a red truth saying "no one in the closed room of the dining hall touched the letter unexpectedly"!" `
`"Well {f:5:done}. `
`If the letter was stuck to the bottom of the serving cart, then anyone could be the {f:5:culprit}." `
`"That might work okay regarding the letter. `
`However, will that same type of argument apply to the knock as well? `
`Let's try this again, shall we?" `
`"......Please, go ahead." `
`"{p:1:Neither Krauss nor Natsuhi nor Genji knocked}!" `
`"{p:1:This isn't the limited meaning of them knocking on the door, okay? `
`It means they didn't use a pillar to transmit the sound or push the play button on a cassette tape they'd recorded or create that knock sound by any means! `
`Of course, this includes all direct, indirect, intentional, coincidental, and unintentional means}!" `
`"This wedge has already been knocked in, but I'll repeat it. `
`{p:2:Maybe someone other than Krauss, Natsuhi, or Genji made that knock, `
`or else a sound that could be misidentified as a knock}." `
`"Please, allow me to speak. `
`{p:1:At 24:00, except for Krauss, Natsuhi, and Genji in the second floor corridor, `
`and all of the people in the dining hall, no other Humans existed inside the mansion}." `
`"Please, allow me to speak. `
`{p:1:In addition to Krauss, Natsuhi, and Genji, none of those in the dining hall knocked, `
`where "knocking" includes all direct, indirect, intentional, unintentional, and coincidental events that could create a knocking sound}." `
`{e:070:A direct knock refers to someone literally hitting a door to make a knocking sound. `
`{n}An intentional knock refers to someone creating a fake knocking sound with intent to make it appear that someone knocked. `
`{n}An unintentional knock refers to someone unintentionally creating a fake knocking sound. `
`{n}A coincidental knock refers to some kind of coincidence creating a fake knocking sound.} `
`"{p:1:In other words, it is impossible for anyone who was in the mansion to have been the source of a knocking {f:5:sound}. `
`......In this case, "anyone" also includes any people who might have gone undetected or {f:5:unobserved}}." `
`"Anyone who was in the mansion" also includes any unknown person X who was secretly hiding in the mansion. `
`Therefore, this literally meant... `
`that "it was impossible for anyone inside the mansion to knock", with no wordplay allowed. `
`"...I see. `
`No matter how much I toy with it, it's impossible for anyone except those in the guesthouse group to create the knocking sound, right? `
`Like me, for example. `
`{p:2:What if I, Furudo Erika, recorded a knocking sound on a cassette tape, `
`secretly installed it somewhere, and set it up so that it would start playing at exactly midnight? `
`Of course, I wasn't in the mansion at midnight.} `
`There aren't any problems with this, are there?" `
`"No {f:5:problems}. `
`However, though the knock did serve as a way of informing them about the letter on the other side of the door, `
`I do not think it would have worked if the letter had fallen {f:5:elsewhere}." `
`If the trick in Erika's theory about the letter being stuck to the serving cart was accurate, `
`then the location that the letter fell was a matter of luck. `
`Because it had fortunately fallen near the door, the people in the dining hall noticed it due to the knock. `
`However, if the location it fell was a matter of chance, `
`...it might have landed in the far off kitchen `
`or remained stuck even after they entered. `
`If that had happened, the knock would have been ignored as though they'd just imagined it. `
`In other words, the knock by itself wouldn't transmit any message at all. `
`It only made it appear as though someone had been there `
`because it was paired with the letter. `
`In that case, the random location the letter fell to off the bottom of the serving cart couldn't be connected with the knock. `
`For the letter to be found thanks to the knock, it would have to be reliably positioned "on the other side of the door". `
`However, `
`it was announced in red that {p:1:no one in the mansion placed the letter in the hallway}. `
`"I'll reword that red about "placing it" in the corridor a bit. `
`{p:1:No one in the mansion placed the letter in the hallway. `
`That goes for every conceivable possibility: directly, indirectly, intentionally, coincidentally, and unintentionally}." `
`"...For example, let's assume there was a device on the serving cart that "drops the letter when it stops moving". `
`In this case, you'd think they could predict that the cart would probably stop just once when those two knocked on the door to the dining hall, `
`and by doing so, they'd be cleverly making it so the letter drops right in front of the door." `
`"But even this doesn't work, okay? `
`The action of "stopping the serving cart" would indirectly lead to "placing the letter in the hallway". `
`That would mean Shannon and Kanon, who were pushing the cart, had "indirectly and unintentionally" placed the letter there! `
`So even this is no good! `
`Furthermore, setting it up so that the letter peeled off with the passage of time... `
`would mean that the people pushing the serving cart had "coincidentally and unintentionally" placed the letter there. `
`Of course, this is also no good!!" `
`"Repeat it. `
`"At 24:00, only Erika, George, Jessica, Maria, Nanjo, Gohda, and Kumasawa existed outside the mansion"." `
`What if someone in the dining hall "didn't exist in the mansion" right at 24:00? `
`For example, what if they'd slipped out a window just before...? `
`With this wordplay, it might be possible to get around the red truth. `
`"...Repeat iiiiiit...? `
`Even though I'm nice enough to give you all this red for free? Aren't you being a bit greedy? `
`I'm not an idiot like Beato, `
`so I won't go around saying everything my opponent tells me to repeat..." `
`"......I'll give you a full body massage in a bath with marshmallows and konpeito sometime soon. `
`Enough to rub your skin off." `
`"Heheheheh, now you've gotta keep that promise. *slurp*! `
`...Okay then, here's a freebie{p:0:♪} `
`I'll respond. `
`"{p:1:At midnight, only Erika, George, Jessica, Maria, Nanjo, Gohda, and Kumasawa existed outside the mansion}"!" `
`In other words, no matter how much they struggled, those 8 people, including Erika, could not have existed inside the mansion, much less in front of the door. `
`And at the same time, no matter how much they struggled, those inside the mansion could not have existed outside the mansion. `
`"{p:2:In that case, the letter might have been stuck to the ceiling of the hallway instead of the serving cart. `
`The ceiling of the hallway is surprisingly high, so even if you just stuck it there out in the open, maybe no one would notice it. `
`This way, it would certainly fall in the corridor. `
`And you can slip by the red if someone outside the mansion did this}! `
`<Good> job, me...!" `
`"Please, allow me to speak. `
`{p:1:The letter never existed on the ceiling of the hallway}." `
`"Please, allow me to speak. `
`{p:1:Know that the letter never touched the serving cart}." `
`"......Wh-Who cares about that?! `
`Anyway, some Human outside the mansion used some kind of trick to place the letter there!! `
`If you try to use that letter and the knock to argue that Beatrice exists, it definitely won't work on Furudo Erika." `
`"Please, allow me to speak. `
`{p:1:It was impossible for anyone outside the mansion to influence anything inside the mansion after the start of the family conference}." `
`"Then someone outside the mansion set up some kind of device before the family conference. `
`Something other than the ceiling or the serving cart!" `
`"Allow me to speak. Blue truth, invalid." `
`"Why...?!! `
`That's the only way, right?! `
`Someone outside the mansion used some kind of device other than the ceiling or the serving cart...!!" `
`"A-Allow me to speak. `
`Unless you can specify or theorize as to what that {i:something} might be, your blue truth will not be acknowledged." `
`"Allow me to speak. `
`All of Lady Erika's blue truths regarding the letter have been lost." `
`"They've all been lost, you say...?! `
`Watch your tongues a bit more, useless furniture! `
`If I can just think of that device, it's an instant checkmate...! `
`What do you mean A L L of them?! What do you mean my blue truth is invalid?! `
`How dare you... `
`say such a thing to me, `
`...the detective, `
`...Furudo Erika......?!!" `
`Erika's face twisted. `
`...These words that seemed to deny Erika... `
`no, Erika's reasoning...were the worst form of torture and humiliation for her. `
`"...<Miss> Erika, `
`why don't we postpone the riddle of the letter for {f:5:now}? `
`...Your blue stake about "someone outside the mansion playing it with a cassette tape" is still {f:5:valid}. `
`If it was possible for sound, then perhaps it wasn't impossible for a letter as {f:5:well}." `
`As Erika made to grab and pull Gertrude's hair, Dlanor stopped her with those words. `
`"That's right, my blue truth regarding the knock is still valid...! `
`It's not true that everything's been denied...!! `
`My master! I will solve the riddle of the letter without fail. `
`Please allow me to postpone that for now...!! `
`However, I will definitely figure out the riddle of the knock here! `
`I've hit you with the blue stake that "{p:2:someone outside the mansion set things up with a cassette tape or something to make a knock sound play}"...!" `
`"Heheheheheheheheheheh...! `
`You really are a cute kid, piece of Bern's. `
`Very lively. `
`Anyway, Erika's yelling that you forgive her because she's solved one of the two riddles, even though she resigned on the other. `
`So, will you forgive her...?" `
`".........Sure. `
`Normally, I'd never forgive my own piece for the shame of surrendering, `
`...but if you've managed to solve one of the riddles, I guess I'll let it slide for now..." `
`"...M-My master..." `
`When Bernkastel said she'd let it slide, Erika couldn't hide her relief. `
`"{i:Then it's time to get punished}, Erika‐chan{p:0:♪}" `
`{a:c: `
`{p:1:None of the characters would misidentify a knocking sound}.} `
`"......Oh? `
`What's that supposed to mean?" `
`"{p:1:Misidentifying a knocking sound means this: `
`they would not mistake a sound very similar to a knocking sound for a real knocking sound. `
`Hitting a pillar to make something similar to a knocking sound is no good. `
`When you record a knocking sound on a cassette tape and play it back, it becomes "the sound of a tape with a knocking sound on it", and not a knocking sound. `
`So that's no good either}!" `
`"{p:1:In other words, all of them would correctly distinguish a knocking sound of something truly hitting the door, `
`and they definitely wouldn't mishear it. `
`It's totally impossible that any sounds except hitting that door directly would be misinterpreted as a knock}!!" `
`"...Wh-What the... `
`But that means...at the time the bell sounding 24:00 went off, `
`no one existed who could have hit the door... `
`Gggh, ggghgghhhhh..." `
`"Yep, they don't exist. `
`After all, the Golden Witch Beatrice hit it. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!!" `
`"......So in other words, there's no way to make it work unless you actually hit the door. `
`So what about this? `
`{p:2:There was some kind of device that could knock on the door. `
`There was something like an automatic door knocker, and that made it possible for someone to knock without touching the door with their hands}." `
`"{p:1:‘To knock’ means someone hitting a door with their hand}! `
`I won't accept hitting it with some device, eheheheheheheheheheheh!! `
`They heard a knock at the same time as the 24:00 bell. `
`At that time, everyone inside the dining hall definitely heard it. `
`{p:1:And none of them would misinterpret a knocking sound. `
`Krauss, Natsuhi, and Genji had no involvement in any knocking. `
`No one else existed inside the mansion. `
`And a "knock" refers to the action of standing directly in front of a door and hitting it with a hand}." `
`"...Hey, Bern. `
`What do you think of my red? `
`Don't you think this is pretty simple and enjoyable despite being before the first twilight? `
`The Golden Witch made her graceful appearance with a knocking sound. `
`*giggle*giggle*, eheheheheheheheheheheheheheheh...!" `
`"............... `
`*giggle*giggle* `
`Ahhahhahhahahahhahaha!! `
`Interesting, this really is riveting, Lambda...! `
`Wouldn't have it any other way. `
`Yes, how amusing! `
`Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!" `
`The two witches doubled over laughing `
`as though this was the most fun thing in the world... `
`"Gah, ......... `
`...M-My master, `
`...don't worry. `
`If you just give my little gray cells some time, I will definitely reach an answer to this pitiful red...!" `
`"Is that so? Thank you. `
`......And I'm disappointed, Erika. `
`You've bored me, Erika. `
`As my piece and double, the fact that you have nothing is so pathetic, it's comical. `
`If you don't know the answer, then be silent forever, please. `
`And please open your mouth {i:only} when you know the answer." `
`"......You're nothing but a lowly piece. `
`Your absence wouldn't hinder my progress in this game in the slightest. `
`If you can't think of any theories in particular, please just go back to the piece tray and gather dust or something. `
`Useless pieces are painful even to remember." `
`"...After all, Bern's pretty forgetful. `
`If you don't try a little harder, Bern's gonna forget you, okay...? `
`You'll collect dust in that forgotten piece tray, awaiting your turn that'll never come. `
`...I imagine that'd be pretty harsh, don't you think...?" `
`"D-Don't worry, Lady Lambdadelta, and my master...! `
`I promise that I'll keep you entertained and never let you down again...!" `
`"......Oh, how reassuring. I guess you're my double after all. `
`...Then make sure you really are giving it your all, in more ways than one. `
`If you don't make an impact, I might forget all about you..." `
`As the two witches giggled, they continued discussing the letter and the knock. `
`There was no room for Erika to step in. `
`If she contented herself with that, `
`...she would literally have no place to go... `
`...and would be buried in an eternal oblivion. `
`Erika endured this with a hideous expression, looking with shame at the back of the master who ignored her. `
`And with both fists clenched, she thought frantically in search of some kind of breakthrough. `
`I am the detective, I am Furudo Erika. `
`I am the piece and double and servant of the Great Lady Bernkastel...!! `
`I'll definitely make her satisfied... `
`satisfied... `
`definitely, definitely, `
`gah, ggghggghhhhhh, `
`...Ushiromiya Battler... `
`...how dare you... `
`...humiliate me so......... `
`As she stood there, ignored by the witches and shrouded in darkness, `
`it looked like someone had told her to go stand all alone in the hallway... `
`With the crime in the early morning, we'd completely forgotten about breakfast, `
`so we now had our first meal of the day at a time that could never be called breakfast time... `
`Even Gohda-san's wonderful meal, which had supposedly been in the works since yesterday, provided no comfort. `
`The several empty seats quietly burdened us with a pain-filled sadness... `
`Then, in the middle of this meal that felt like a vigil, Erika suddenly stood up. `
`Everyone focused on her to see what was the matter. `
`Her expression was somewhere between relief and insanity, as though she'd made some groundbreaking and strange discovery. `
`"...Hey, what's up? `
`Are you okay...?" `
`"I've got it, I've got it!! `
`Did you think I wouldn't understand? `
`Yes, I've got it, there's no way something that stupid could happen...!" `
`With a hideous expression covered in cold sweat, Erika glared and lashed out at Battler. `
`"......What `
`do you get...?" `
`"There's no way you jumped down from the third floor study...! `
`Not one of us saw you fall down and land in the courtyard...!!" `
`"........." `
`"{p:2:When you set up the ladder from the courtyard and saw Rudolf‐san go up it to the third‐story window, `
`you closely observed the structure of the outer wall and realized that by cleverly using the rain gutters and other handholds, it would be possible to descend to the courtyard from the third‐floor window...! `
`You didn't {i:jump down}! `
`You used the rain gutters and so on and clambered down the outer wall like a loser}!! `
`What do you think of my blue truth?!! Come on, what's your counterargument?!" `
`"......My counterargument?" `
`"You don't have a counterargument? `
`Then my truth is valid, right?! `
`Hey, did you see that?! `
`{p:2:It may have looked like you jumped down all dramatically, but it was all an illusion! `
`All you actually did was jump out and grab desperately onto the rain gutter}...!!" `
`"......... `
`...My argument then was about whether it was possible for Grandfather to escape from the study, right...? `
`And it was possible for Grandfather to escape through the window. `
`All I did was prove that. `
`...Whether I jumped down or crawled down, that doesn't change anything, does it?" `
`"Don't try to change the subject!! `
`A mere Human can't jump down from the third floor...!! `
`Did you see that, did you see that...?!! `
`What do you think of my reasoning, my master...?!!" `
`"...Are you tired or something? `
`Just calm down and eat some food." `
`When he escaped to the courtyard through the window... `
`Battler really did use the rain gutter to crawl down the wall, just like Erika said. `
`His hand had slipped halfway, and he had fallen from a considerable height, `
`but he had managed to land on his feet. `
`...No one had witnessed this, `
`but most likely, everyone in the dining hall now except Erika had realized that something like this had happened. `
`Since the very beginning, no one had believed that he'd jumped down from the third floor window. `
`...Even if they hadn't witnessed that directly. `
`So they had no clue what Erika was complaining about all of a sudden... `
`and started to whisper, staring at her with cold eyes and dubious faces... `
`"You can't counter that, can you?! `
`You jumping down has already been denied! `
`My truth has won!! `
`My blue truth is valid!" `
`"My master, please acknowledge this!! `
`I am not incompetent or a disappointment...! `
`I will match up to your expectations without fail, so please don't abandon me!! My master...!!" `
`Facing someone that might have been somewhere beyond the ceiling, Erika spread her arms and yelled. `
`Then, ......as if in answer, a massive lightning bolt landed very close by. `
`It was an incredible sound. `
`They could even feel the earth shake. `
`At the same time as that sound, Erika went limp and fell into her seat `
`like a puppet who'd just had all its strings cut. `
`Then, as the sound of wind and rain slowly filled the room once again, `
`...Erika slowly opened her eyes as though recovering from a bout of dizziness. `
`Then, she continued eating in silence as though nothing had happened. `
`As if she had been acting normally the whole time. `
`...Didn't Erika just stand up suddenly and yell something strange at someone...? `
`Automatically, enough to make one doubt their eyes, Erika continued eating quietly as though everything was perfectly normal. `
`When they saw how ordinary she looked, ...everyone convinced themselves that they were totally worn out... `
`and that they must have just seen some illusion of Erika suddenly yelling. `
`So Erika's sudden transfiguration of a few seconds ago was treated as a daydream... `
`and faded out of everyone's memories... `
`Erika quietly poked at her salad and muttered in a voice no one could hear. `
`Thank you very much, Great Lady Bernkastel... `
`I am Furudo Erika. `
`I am my master's piece and her double. `
`...I will most certainly present you with an incredible tale. `
`Heheheheh... `
`"That's right, when it comes to utensils, knives and forks are pretty primitive. `
`Chopsticks are the best. `
`Don't you think chopsticks are the easiest way to eat salad? `
`Well, everyone?" `
