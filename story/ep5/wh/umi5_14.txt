`......All of the pieces from the game board were gathered. `
`All of the Humans, furniture, witches, and the witches on an even higher level... `
`...had gathered in one place. `
`That place was like a solemn cathedral, with an unbelievably high ceiling. `
`White stonework. `
`Golden ornaments. `
`Though there were windows, there were no entrances or exits. `
`It was a strange, strange place. `
`But for some reason, no one wondered where this strange place was. `
`...Because they were not given the right to think of this place as strange. `
`"The pieces. `
`Have they all been gathered?" `
`"Yes, they have." `
`"Well done. `
`...What a show. `
`I wonder just how many people there are here." `
`".........No matter how many we see, every being outside the 18 is a phantom." `
`"Making you acknowledge them is what my game's all about. `
`*cackle*cackle*!" `
`The three witches were seated on special thrones set upon a very high balcony. `
`In the center sat the Game Master, Lambdadelta, `
`and on either side of the semicircular balcony sat Bernkastel and Beatrice, facing each other. `
`Below them, Erika ran forward, lifted the corners of her skirt and bowed respectfully. `
`"Great Lady Lambdadelta, we thank you for granting our request for an assembly. `
`...And Great Lady Bernkastel, my master, `
`please look forward to it. `
`Though it may be only for a short while, I will most certainly make my master forget about the poison that torments her." `
`"Yes, I am looking forward to it. `
`......I'd expect no less from my double, `
`my piece." `
`Erika and Bernkastel exchanged cruel smiles that'd make anyone want to avert their gaze. `
`"Listen up, witches and Humans!! `
`I hereby announce that with this assembly of witches gathered, the Court of Illusions will now begin!!" `
`The commander of the game spoke with words of power. `
`Though her words were spoken within such a vast space, `
`they rang out with the force of a bell in a bell tower... `
`"Your lives and roles as they correspond to this game are over! `
`The 5th game is now closed, and the 24:00 answer session shall begin! `
`...Well, I'd like to get started quickly, but why don't we have everyone quickly introduce themselves first? `
`After all, there are so many people here." `
`"Heheheheh! `
`I am Lambdadelta! `
`The Witch of Certainty and the new commander of this game!" `
`"......Bernkastel. `
`Witch of Miracles. `
`...My goal is to penetrate Beatrice's Illusion of the Witch." `
`"I am the Endless Witch, Beatrice. `
`My goals are to claim my own existence and to protect Natsuhi and Kinzo." `
`"..............." `
`"...Battler-sama, `
`you come next in rank." `
`"......I'm Ushiromiya Battler. `
`I'm fighting against Beato's......no, against the witches. `
`...That's all." `
`"As I believe you know, you joined in on this game partway through. `
`At the time this assembly of witches opens, you have yet to participate. `
`Do you understand...?" `
`"I get it. `
`...You probably mean I don't have the right to speak for a while, right?" `
`"Thank you for understanding." `
`Even though Battler held a rank near that of witches, `
`he sat on the foremost of the benches shared with the other relatives, all by himself at one end. `
`He met the gaze of Beato, who was up on the balcony. `
`"You might've said you were my arch-enemy." `
`"......Well, you aren't necessarily my only enemy." `
`"Hmph... `
`......Let's take this game back. `
`It belongs to us." `
`".........Yeah." `
`I almost said I was fighting against Beato's Illusion of the Witch. `
`......Since the beginning, Beato has been my only enemy. `
`But...right now, Erika and those witches who started toying around with Beato's tale... `
`...are also my enemies. `
`Who should I fight and how? `
`Maybe it's a good thing I don't have the right to speak for a while. `
`I'll calm down and coolly watch over everything... `
`"I am the detective and the one who called for this assembly of witches, Furudo Erika. `
`I will expose the culprit of the 5th game and stick a charming period on the end of this tale." `
`Erika greeted the witches above her and the Humans behind her once again. `
`"I'm also looking forward to it. `
`Okay, remaining pieces, introduce yourselves in whatever order." `
`"Humans! `
`Introduce yourselves, all of you...!" `
`When 45 urged him to introduce himself, Kinzo stood up. `
`"...I'm Ushiromiya Kinzo. `
`I slipped out of the study window and am hiding somewhere on Rokkenjima." `
`"Ushiromiya Krauss. `
`Currently, I have been captured and am being confined somewhere." `
`"I'm Ushiromiya Eva. `
`I'm alive." `
`"I'm Rudolf. `
`...The rest of us are all Ushiromiyas too, so I'll leave off the family name." `
`"I'm Ushiro-, ...Rosa. `
`I was killed on the first twilight." `
`"Jessica. `
`I also died on the first twilight." `
`"I'm George. `
`...I also died on the first twilight." `
`"Maria. `
`I died, but look, I'm here talking. `
`See? `
`Dying isn't a big deal, right? `
`Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihi..." `
`"I'm Ushiromiya Natsuhi. `
`...I am alive." `
`"......Heheheheheheheh." `
`"............Gah..." `
`"Hideyoshi here. `
`I was killed just a short while ago." `
`"Kyrie. `
`I'm still alive." `
`"Nanjo... `
`I am also hanging in there..." `
`"My name is Genji. `
`......I passed away on the first twilight." `
`"I'm Shannon. `
`...I'm still alive." `
`"I'm Kanon. `
`I'm also alive." `
`"I-I'm Gohda. `
`Pleased to meet you, everyone..." `
`"I am Kumasawa... `
`Pleased to meet you..." `
`"Now, on to the witches! `
`Everyone, introduce yourselves!" `
`Virgilia's group could also be seen. `
`Unlike the floor Beato's group was on, the second floor had a balcony that looked like raised audience seating, `
`and they sat there, looking down as though they were at a theater... `
`"......My name is Virgilia. `
`I am Beatrice's teacher." `
`"I'm Gaap. `
`Making corpses disappear is my job." `
`"Ronove. `
`I'm in charge of making black tea. `
`Pu ku ku..." `
`"I greet you in the name of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory. `
`I served in the murder of Hideyoshi on the second twilight." `
`""""""The Seven Sisters of Purgatory, right here!"""""" `
`"Let us then have Lady Erika's furniture introduce themselves." `
`"Gertrude. `
`I am an Assistant Inquisitor of Heresy." `
`"Cornelia. `
`I am an Assistant Inquisitor of Heresy." `
`The two of them could also be seen on the second-floor audience seating. `
`They sat apart from Virgilia's group. `
`Then, ...Dlanor, who was seated between the two, slowly stood up. `
`She had a presence and dignity about her, as though she was overseeing everything from that place. `
`"Dlanor A. Knox is my {f:5:name}. `
`......I am Lady Erika's primary {f:5:assistant}." `
`"............" `
`"Battler, `
`I expect much from {f:5:you}. `
`Please don't disappoint {f:5:me}." `
`"...Let's just both give it all we've got." `
`"Most of the time, there will be no need for Dlanor to step forward. `
`However, when the witch side plays around with ugly word games, I'll need to have Dlanor convict them. `
`...A miracle like the one in the study won't happen again." `
`"............" `
`"And finally, let us introduce ourselves. `
`We are the Chiester Sisters Imperial Guards, who have been tasked with management of proceedings at this assembly of witches." `
`"H-Hello everyone...!!" `
`"Nyeh nyeh{p:0:♪}" `
`"This ends the introductions of all pieces. `
`A total of 38 people are present here!" `
`There are 38 characters in the 5th game, `
`but if you added all the pieces from previous games too, it would probably rise even higher. `
`This game, which has so often been likened to chess, now has far more pieces than a chessboard. `
`"Very well. `
`Then I guess we'll get started. `
`Let the person who called this meeting begin! `
`...Oh, excuse me, Mr. Goat. `
`Refill my drink." `
`"...And some popcorn for me." `
`"Yeah, that's right. `
`......The one who decided demons ought to eat popcorn when watching a play {i:was you}, after all." `
`"Yes, I intend to enjoy this. `
`......And could I get some black tea and mustard miso? `
`Erika, begin. `
`I'm already starting to get bored." `
`"Yes, my master, leave it to me...!! `
`Order!! Silence!" `
`At the sound of her voice, the Chiester Sisters Corps straightened up, lifted their right knees, and stamped down hard on the floor with their heels. `
`It became a low, deep rumble in the ground, and all chatter in the cathedral disappeared instantly... `
`as their eyes and expressions became even more hollow and empty. `
`...The room fell back into silence, almost as though they were a collection of wax models... `
`Amidst this heavy silence, there was the sound of footsteps... `
`as Erika walked out into the center, where she could catch everyone's attention. `
`When she signaled with her chin, a goat attendant appeared from behind a pillar... `
`...and carried a single, plain chair out into the front and center of the room. `
`It must have been...the defendant's chair. `
`"I, Furudo Erika, will make an accusation. `
`The murderer of the 5th game is..." `
`"Ushiromiya Natsuhi-san. `
`You are the culprit." `
`Erika pointed at Natsuhi and spoke... `
`The Natsuhi wax doll alone...shook and regained its expression. `
`...It was an expression of panic. `
`"Chiester Sisters, `
`please take the defendant to her chair." `
`"Understood." `
`"Wait, ...what are you doing?!! `
`Let go of me!!" `
`45 and 410 both pinned Natsuhi's arms behind her back... `
`and led her to the chair in the center. `
`Natsuhi resisted, but the Chiester Sisters were surprisingly strong, and she couldn't do anything. `
`She turned to the relatives for help, but they just remained silent like wax models... `
`"I, Furudo Erika, `
`will now reconstruct why the crime was only possible for Ushiromiya Natsuhi." `
`"......Beato, `
`of course, you'll be challenging this, right?" `
`"Naturally. `
`I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, Beatrice the Golden. `
`...Furudo Erika, I challenge you. `
`I'll take these false accusations you're trying to place on my master... `
`and tear them apart!!" `
`"B-Beatrice...!" `
`"Fear not, Natsuhi. `
`You are my master. `
`And you are the true Head, with the One-Winged Eagle engraved in your heart. `
`Do not fear a crime you have not committed." `
`At those words, Natsuhi jerked back...and gulped. `
`Her panic finally disappeared, and she stood up straight. `
`"...Th-That's true...! `
`I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi! `
`I will confront any challenge that would disgrace the Ushiromiya family!" `
`"......*giggle* `
`How can you try a bluff like that in a situation like this? `
`...You really are the bullied kid in every single Fragment." `
`"So, Bern, `
`make your claims." `
`"I, Bernkastel, claim... `
`that a Human, Ushiromiya Natsuhi, is the culprit of this game." `
`"And you too Beato, okay?" `
`"I, Beatrice, claim... `
`that the culprit in this game is not Human! `
`I am the culprit!" `
`Bernkastel, who smiled daringly, and Beatrice, who smiled firmly, crossed gazes. `
`"Listen, witches and Humans!! `
`Two claims have appeared for a single truth! `
`Is the culprit a Human, Ushiromiya Natsuhi? `
`Is the culprit a witch, Beatrice?!" `
`"If the witch wins, the truth about the 5th game will disappear into darkness. `
`If Erika wins, the Illusion of the Witch will be wiped from the game board. `
`...In other words, for Beato alone, this is a battle that must not be lost. Are you prepared?" `
`"And what am I supposed be preparing myself for? `
`This has always been just what I wanted...!" `
`...If Erika wins, the Illusion of the Witch will be destroyed. `
`That means the existence of the witch will be denied. `
`Beato was fighting for her life. `
`However, this wasn't the only time she had been fighting for her life. `
`...It had always been a life-or-death struggle, even when she fought with Battler. `
`...Because if Battler had won and destroyed the Illusion of the Witch in the previous games, `
`Beato would have been destroyed. `
`"...That's dirty. `
`Erika alone has nothing to lose if she fails." `
`"I wonder. `
`...Lady Bernkastel is not a compassionate person. `
`...I can't imagine she'd give warm treatment to a piece that didn't perform to her expectations..." `
`It was inconceivable that the ruthless Bernkastel would place no blame at all on a piece who had suffered defeat. `
`...Erika was probably fighting for her life just as much. `
`The two claims would clash, and one would be weeded out. `
`One would fall...and would not leave this place alive... `
`The only ones who truly had nothing to lose...were those witches. `
`"OK, no problems! `
`Get started!!" `
`"......In that case, `
`I would like to go first. `
`The murder of Hideyoshi-san is very simple. `
`It should be impossible to suspect anyone other than Natsuhi-san. `
`Except for the victim and Natsuhi-san, all of us were in the same room, correct?" `
`It really was simple. `
`...Except for Natsuhi, everyone had been inside the parlor. `
`And because it was so simple, it was decisive... `
`"...No matter how you look at it, the one who killed Hideyoshi was Natsuhi. `
`No, it's the other way around. `
`...No matter how you look at it, no one except for Natsuhi could have killed Hideyoshi. `
`There's no room for discussion or debate." `
`"I-I'm telling you, that's a mistake...!! `
`Maybe I don't have an alibi. `
`However, I don't believe a lack of an alibi proves that one is the culprit...!" `
`"Hmph, we know that Natsuhi is the only one without an alibi. `
`But wait. `
`The scene of the murder was a closed room. `
`It should've been impossible for anyone, including Natsuhi, to have committed the crime in that room. `
`Except for me, since I could've done it with magic." `
`"I'll explain the closed room trick--the "how dunnit"--later. `
`For the time being, I'll start with the "who dunnit". `
`...Because of the aforementioned, it's impossible to suspect any character except Natsuhi-san regarding the murder of Hideyoshi-san." `
`"......Milady, `
`it may be dangerous to press any further on this." `
`"I agree. `
`It's a fact that Natsuhi was hiding in the closet of Hideyoshi's room. `
`...When it comes to repeating things in red, they'll check to see who's in the room, and you'll be cornered." `
`"...Probably. `
`Lady Lambdadelta is the commander of this game. `
`...If it suits her fancy, she'll set up Natsuhi as the culprit regardless of the facts." `
`If the typhoon passes and the police come to perform a scientific investigation, `
`perhaps the true culprit will be identified, and the false accusations against Natsuhi will be lifted. `
`However, in this closed-off Rokkenjima, the police will not arrive for all eternity. `
`...In other words, the real truth will not be revealed. `
`Inside this cat box that will never be opened, false charges that everyone accepts are worth no more or less than the truth. `
`"Their aim is most likely to use the simple murder of Hideyoshi to give the impression that Natsuhi-sama is the culprit... `
`before moving on to the first twilight's reconstruction, which has more uncertain elements." `
`"It's not good at all to move forward with the Game Master suspecting us. `
`We should take the initiative." `
`"Sure. `
`.........Lady Lambdadelta! `
`As you are well aware, a fair number of murders were committed during the 5th game, `
`and we are skipping the rather lengthy chunk of time from midnight until the early morning." `
`"Skipping to Hideyoshi's murder `
`and stepping backwards and forwards in time will only lead to confusion. `
`It is my belief that we should follow events chronologically and in order, though the decision is yours, of course." `
`"Objection. `
`In the process of prosecuting the culprit, chronological order has no significance." `
`"Objection. `
`Furudo Erika is trying to mix up the chronological sequence in order to create a false impression of the events." `
`"Well, I'm not a fan of confusing things myself. `
`I accept Beato's claim. `
`Erika, start with the first twilight instead of jumping to the second." `
`".........Tch." `
`I definitely saw Erika click her tongue. `
`...I understand. `
`So, this is {i:a way of telling Rokkenjima's tale}. `
`I was guided by Virgilia, met Beatrice, `
`...reached the peak from which you can see everything below you, and finally understood the truth of this world. `
`"This is...that thing you were talking about earlier, Virgilia." `
`"......Yes, that's right. `
`Truth is very fragile in this place." `
`"As long as each side makes its own claim, different truths can exist at the same time..." `
`Yes. `
`This really is a trial. `
`Both sides put forth their own truths. `
`This here truly is the Braun tube trial that Virgilia once used as an analogy... `
`"Then I will follow Lady Lambdadelta's orders and start from the first crime at the first twilight. `
`As you know, at 24:00 on October 4th, the first day, `
`following a short break in the family conference, Natsuhi left on her own, saying that she was going to bed early. `
`Therefore, her alibi is completely lost from that time until the next morning." `
`"Oh, is that so? `
`I believe there are several people besides Natsuhi who have dubious alibis. `
`Unless you can clear suspicion from all of them, I cannot allow you to call Natsuhi the culprit." `
`"True. `
`If Erika's gonna call Natsuhi suspicious so confidently, `
`she's first gotta show that everyone else has an alibi. `
`Right, Bern?" `
`"......Yes, of course. `
`Erika will explain that perfectly." `
`"Of course, my master...! `
`In that case, I would like to explain things in order. `
`Let's forget about Genji's murder for now and focus on the crime in the guesthouse. `
`For this case, you'd like to suspect the servants who were in the guesthouse, right? `
`On that night, Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san were there. `
`Isn't that right, you two?" `
`When she turned to face the direction where those two were seated, ...those two wax models alone came back to life. `
`They probably weren't even granted souls until they were allowed to speak. `
`In that case, it would've been better if Natsuhi's soul could've disappeared as well... `
`...Natsuhi, who was in the defendant's chair, kept her soul the whole time, and was constantly hanging her head, looking nervous... `
`Gohda hurried to his feet and answered Erika's question. `
`"Y-Yes, that is correct. `
`On that evening, I was alone in the guesthouse servant room..." `
`"Well, look at my age. `
`Staying up all night would be a heavy burden, `
`so I returned to the waiting room in the guesthouse and went to bed right away on my own, ...yes, yes...!" `
`"...Doesn't that mean Gohda and Kumasawa have lost their alibis?!! `
`Kumasawa claims that she was sleeping alone in the waiting room. `
`Gohda claims he was alone in the servant room. `
`Either of them should have had enough time to go to the cousin room and commit murder!!" `
`"N-N-Nonsense...! `
`Why would we do something like that...?!" `
`"That's right, that's right...! `
`How could I ever kill someone...?!" `
`"Natsuhi said it all. `
`Both Kumasawa, who was sleeping alone in the waiting room, and Gohda, who was alone in the servant room, `
`are in the exact same situation as Natsuhi in her room. `
`Both of them have lost their alibis." `
`"Have no fear. `
`I guarantee that neither of these two are murderers. `
`First off, following dinner, Kumasawa-san left the mansion with me and the others and went to the guesthouse, `
`entered the waiting room, and slept until morning. `
`It's the same for Gohda-san. `
`Once he finished with his job, he chatted with us in the lounge and went to sleep afterwards. `
`Neither of them had the opportunity to commit murder." `
`"Hmph. `
`So, we're finally here." `
`"...I see it's time for me to stand up as well. `
`Your turn is over already, Erika. `
`...Go summon that bodyguard you rely on so much." `
`Beato glanced at where Dlanor sat on the second-floor audience seating. `
`...However, Dlanor just stared back with those usual expressionless eyes. `
`"Repeat it. `
`"We have absolute proof of Gohda and Kumasawa's alibis"." `
`"We refuse. `
`......Why give a hint to an enemy? `
`There's no way we'd answer." `
`"Aha. `
`Did you hear that, Lady Lambdadelta? `
`They say they have no proof! `
`How could they claim that Gohda and Kumasawa have alibis without proof?!" `
`"Good point. `
`What do you say, Bern, Erika? `
`How can you claim that Gohda and Kumasawa have alibis?" `
`"Fall back, Erika. `
`My opponent is Dlanor over there. `
`A mere Human like you can be no match for a witch!" `
`"..............." `
`"No. `
`There's no need for Dlanor to step forward. `
`......In fact, it's precisely because a mere Human will defeat a witch... that the Illusion of the Witch will now be denied. `
`...So go ahead. `
`Use the red and blue as much as you like. `
`...I'm ready for it, okay?" `
`In response to Erika's challenge, Beato smiled boldly yet gracefully and slowly stood up. `
`And they glared at each other between the floor and the balcony... `
`"{p:2:Gohda and Kumasawa have no alibis. `
`The two of them were in the guesthouse and could have reached the cousins' room to commit murder at any time. `
`Unless you can eliminate that possibility, you cannot treat Natsuhi as the culprit}." `
`Beato's blue truth struck out rapidly. `
`The curtain had finally dropped, and the battle had begun... `
`"...A Human like Erika can't use any red. `
`How could she turn this around without calling Dlanor?" `
`"Though Erika cannot use it, her master, Lady Bernkastel, can. `
`...We mustn't let our guards down." `
`"Blue truth, valid. `
`...What'll you do, Bern? `
`Will you or Dlanor step in instead?" `
`"It is still not my {f:5:turn}. `
`And it is not Lady Bernkastel's turn {f:5:either}." `
`"...Yes, that's right. `
`There's no need for us to show up for something like this. `
`...This is important precisely because a mere Human like Furudo Erika will defeat you, Beato." `
`"......Because you'll be defeated by a Human, we'll know. `
`We'll all know that the fake witch who calls herself "Beatrice the Golden" is nothing more than a sub-Human phantom." `
`"*giggle*giggle*... `
`If you really could do that, it'd be totally entertaining... `
`Very well, Erika. `
`Let's see what you've got...!" `
`"Explaining it for the first person, Kumasawa-san, is extremely simple. `
`Kumasawa-san, stand." `
`"...Y-Yes...!" `
`"Kumasawa-san, from the time you went to bed last night to the time you were informed about the crime in the morning, `
`did you ever leave the waiting room?" `
`"No! `
`I was sound asleep until morning, I really was!!" `
`"The truth is... `
`...after dinner last night, I had a chat with Eva-san, and she told me something very interesting. `
`...I tried that out myself." `
`"And what exactly is "that"...? `
`...You don't mean..." `
`"That's right. `
`It's what cornered and sealed Kinzo in his study. `
`...I learned that you can create a seal by putting something between a door and the frame." `
`"......Are you kidding...? `
`Did she actually...do that to Kumasawa-san's waiting room?!" `
`"Erika was in the guesthouse, so there's no obstacle to her having been capable of that." `
`"After all, it was an unsettling night, and a massive amount of gold had just been discovered. `
`Many sorts of crimes might have occurred. `
`...Where there is a detective, there will be a crime. `
`I foresaw that some kind of crime would take place, so I used this to seal away people whose alibis might otherwise be lost." `
`Erika held a small, folded piece of brown paper high in the air. `
`"After I watched Kumasawa-san, who returned to the guesthouse with me, say goodnight and enter the waiting room, `
`I used this to seal the door. `
`Then, in the morning, `
`when the crime was discovered and caused a big uproar, I immediately went to check Kumasawa-san's waiting room, `
`where I confirmed that the seal was still set. `
`Therefore, I can prove Kumasawa-san's alibi!" `
`"......<Good>. `
`A wonderful alibi. Not a single gap. `
`Kumasawa returned to the guesthouse with Erika, went to the waiting room to sleep, and never left the room until morning. `
`{p:1:In other words, after Kumasawa returned to the guesthouse, she never went to the second floor until morning}." `
`The proof Erika had shown was elevated by Bernkastel and became red truth. `
`This truth, which had become red, could no longer be overturned, even by Beato... `
`In other words, in that instant, Kumasawa's perfect alibi had been absolutely guaranteed. `
`"Hohoh! `
`Then what about Gohda?!" `
`"Gohda-san holed up in the servant room right after reaching the guesthouse. `
`I sealed him up in the same way. `
`Then, when Rosa-san returned at 1:00 AM, I happened to notice her when I stepped out into the corridor. `
`I let Gohda-san, who was still in the servant room, know this." `
`"At that moment, the seal was still in place, so from the time we arrived at the guesthouse until 1:00 AM, `
`Gohda-san never left the servant room. `
`And afterwards, he was with me in the lounge until 3:00 AM. `
`And after 3:00 AM, I was on the second floor, `
`so I can guarantee that Gohda-san didn't come up to the second floor." `
`"......Erika's seal proves that Gohda was holed up in the servant room until 1:00 AM. `
`And Erika has proven his alibi from `
`then until 3:00 AM, since she was passing the time in the lounge with him. `
`And Erika has also proven that he never set foot `
`on the second floor until the morning after." `
`"{p:1:In other words, after Gohda returned to the guesthouse, he never went up to the second floor until morning}." `
`"Red truth, valid. `
`...Well done, Erika. `
`The alibi due to your seal on that door has been acknowledged by Bern and elevated to the status of red truth." `
`"Thank you very much, my master. `
`...I am the detective! I may be Human, but I can use the red truth despite that and surpass Humans!" `
`"So now you claim to have surpassed Humans... `
`It's a thousand years too early for you to talk like that, conceited brat!" `
`"It'll be a pain to have you try anything funny, so I'll make this clear now. `
`In fact, I should've done this in the beginning. `
`I apologize for being so roundabout. `
`This is the situation around the guesthouse at 24:00." `
`"......The gold was found, an emergency family meeting was called for, and Battler-san went to the mansion with the relatives. `
`I, the three cousins, Doctor Nanjo, Gohda-san, and Kumasawa-san remained in the guesthouse." `
`"I have already explained Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san's alibis. `
`George-san, Jessica-san, and Maria-san were playing cards in the cousin room. `
`I actually joined them for a just little bit, and I clearly witnessed that they were alive at that time." `
`"My master, I ask that you repeat this!!" `
`"Yes, I'll respond. `
`{p:1:At 24:00 in the guesthouse, George, Jessica, and Maria were alive, `
`and they were in the second‐floor cousins' room. `
`Nanjo, Gohda, and Kumasawa were on the first floor}." `
`"And, since there's no need to hold off on it anymore, `
`I'll confirm that all the victims so far are dead. `
`{p:1:George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, and Genji—these five really are dead}. `
`How could they be playing dead with their necks sliced open like that?" `
`"Thanks for repeating that, my master...! `
`If we hadn't made these things clear, you might have started going on about how they were already dead before I guaranteed everyone's alibis, `
`or that they weren't actually dead at all." `
`"......Gah..." `
`Unsurprisingly, Beato's side couldn't get away with the simple plan of claiming that the victims were only playing dead. `
`But in order to overcome Gohda and Kumasawa's alibis, it should've been possible to suppose that the crime occurred before those doors were sealed. `
`However, the opponent had predicted this move perfectly. `
`It had been shown in red that the crime did not occur before the time period covered by Erika's alibis. `
`"Got it. `
`That's the last time the victims were confirmed to be alive. `
`I wish you'd said that in the beginning. `
`...This means we can ignore everything that happened before 24:00." `
`"......To go even further, `
`{p:1:at 24:00, Natsuhi, Krauss, and Genji were in a corridor on the second floor of the mansion. `
`All the remaining people were at the family conference in the dining hall. `
`Of course, at that point in time, no murder had occurred. `
`Genji was also alive}." `
`"This isn't something Erika observed, `
`but we can't move the game forward without settling it. `
`Very well, I'll acknowledge that red truth." `
`"Thank you very much for that red truth, my master!" `
`Since Erika had been in the guesthouse, `
`it was only natural that she could explain the situation there. `
`However, since she hadn't been in the mansion at the time, `
`explaining the situation over there would have been extremely difficult for her. `
`...Beato would normally have attacked there with the blue truth, `
`saying that the people in the dining hall had all agreed to keep to the same story, `
`that someone had snuck out of the dining hall, and that they might have committed murder in the guesthouse. `
`However, because Bern had instantly settled that matter with the red text, `
`Beato had completely lost her chance to strike back... `
`"Dammit........." `
`"...Very troublesome. `
`...To think we would be put at such a disadvantage..." `
`"This is almost the exact opposite of Riiche's fights with Battler..." `
`"...In fact, the situation might be even worse than it was back then." `
`At a glance, the fight between the two of them resembled our previous fights. `
`However, there were some vital differences. `
`The first was whether or not Beato was the Game Master. `
`The Beato who fought against me was the Game Master. `
`So she knew all the truth. `
`That's why she was able to use the red text at will. `
`However, the current Beato isn't the Game Master. `
`She's just a single piece on the game board. `
`...In other words, even Beato doesn't know the truth. `
`So you could say that Beato is now in the same position I once was. `
`Also, though Erika may seem to be in the same position I once was, `
`the situation for her is totally different. `
`She's connected to the witch called Bernkastel. `
`...Even though she isn't the Game Master, she's capable of elevating Erika's statements to become red truth. `
`Because of this, Erika can use the red truth, even though she's neither a witch nor the Game Master. `
`Beato, who's supposed to be the witch, possesses no truth nor red she can use. `
`And yet the detective, Erika, can use the red truth. `
`The advantage has completely flipped over to the other side. `
`...Perhaps you could say that the current Beato is in a much worse position than I was when I fought with her. `
`After I got used to the game, Beato stopped responding to my demands that she use the red, `
`but in the beginning, she had responded to almost all of them, giving me quite a few hints. `
`That's why we were able to fight on par. `
`However, Bernkastel is different. `
`She fully understands the rules of this game...and is prepared to corner Beato without even a hint of restraint. `
`......And because of this, I knew. `
`In the past, ...Beato went easy on me so that we could fight on par with each other... `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*... `
`This has become quite an amusing fight. `
`...I see, so I must fight from the position Battler once stood in." `
`"......Beato..." `
`"In the past, I've insulted you and called you incompetent. `
`...I can handle much, much worse than this. *cackle*cackle*!" `
`"It's now impossible to suspect Gohda and Kumasawa. `
`You can't win by arguing that point any longer." `
`"Yes. `
`Let's switch to a different approach." `
`"The next in line would probably be Nanjo. `
`He was also in the guesthouse." `
`"Nanjo was in the lounge with Erika. `
`...However, I believe the time periods before and after that have been left open." `
`"That's right, I'll strike there. `
`...Nanjo, `
`you were relaxing in the first floor lounge of the guesthouse with Erika and Gohda, correct?" `
`"Yes... `
`I was with Erika-san the whole time..." `
`"And during what time was this?" `
`"F-From 1:00 AM to 3:00 AM." `
`"Yes, that's right. `
`It was the period between 1:00 and 3:00. `
`Doctor Nanjo, Gohda-san, and I were relaxing in the lounge. `
`...Repeat it, my master!" `
`"I'll respond. `
`{p:1:From {nobr:1 a.m.} to {nobr:3 a.m.}, the trio of Erika, Nanjo, and Gohda... `
`spent their time in the lounge on the first floor of the guesthouse}." `
`...Though she had flat-out refused to repeat what Beato told her to, she responded to Erika's demand immediately. `
`The red truth...was starting to corner Beato. `
`...She grimaced as though in pain, but she still struck back with the blue truth. `
`...No, perhaps she really was in pain. `
`Now that the characters apart from Natsuhi have had their alibis established, the Illusion of the Witch is also being denied. `
`Beato perceived the denial of her existence as pain... `
`"{p:2:Even so, he shouldn't have an alibi for the time period before and after you were in the lounge! `
`It was possible for Nanjo to commit the crime too}!" `
`"That's right. `
`I get that Nanjo was in the lounge with Erika from 1:00 to 3:00, but what about before and after that? `
`...What about that, Erika?" `
`"Yes. `
`First, the alibi for before 1:00 AM. `
`This is no problem at all. `
`I played cards with the cousins in their room until 24:00, `
`and then went downstairs to the lounge, where I met Doctor Nanjo." `
`"That's right... `
`At 24:00, I met Erika-san after she came down the stairs and spoke with her, learning that she was quite the connoisseur of the mystery genre. `
`I realized that I'd found a kindred spirit..." `
`"When I went into the library to solve the epitaph's riddle, `
`I noticed that there were several original copies of famous foreign mystery novels stored there. `
`So, I wanted to discuss them with the actual books in hand. `
`We moved to the library and were talking the whole time. `
`Constantly, until we moved to the lounge." `
`Cramped though it was, that book storage room in the guesthouse was stocked well enough that it was fair to call it a small library. `
`In it were several famous foreign mystery novels `
`that Kinzo had once taken a liking to. `
`Of course, they were all originals and in English, but English was no problem for either Erika or Nanjo. `
`For this occasion, they had borrowed the key to the library one more time from Gohda in the servant room. `
`At that point, Erika checked the seal again, and, of course, reset it. `
`Damn her. `
`Even though she keeps it sealed for anyone else to enter or leave, she alone enters and leaves whenever she wants. `
`"I see. `
`So, from 24:00 until 3:00 AM when you went to sleep, you were with Nanjo the whole time? `
`That means Nanjo's alibi is the most rock solid of them all." `
`"Yes, that's it exactly! `
`My master, repeat it...!" `
`"I'll respond. `
`{p:1:After 24:00, Erika was with Nanjo the whole time until {nobr:3 a.m}}." `
`At 24:00, the crime in the cousin room still hadn't occurred. `
`So this way, an alibi had been established for the period before the time they were in the lounge. `
`"After that, we walked out of the library and into the hallway at 1:00 AM. `
`When we did, we just happened to bump into Rosa-san as she returned. `
`I then told Gohda-san about that. `
`...I figured it was probably a servant's responsibility to welcome in a guest." `
`Gohda asked if he should bring a towel, but Rosa refused. `
`She quickly headed up to the second floor. `
`At this point, Erika, Gohda, and Nanjo gathered together and decided to have a drink... `
`Their alibis in the lounge up until 3:00 AM have already been proclaimed in red, so there are no problems there. `
`"Let's continue on to after 3:00 AM. `
`This is Doctor Nanjo's alibi after we split up. `
`At 3:00 AM, Battler-san returned and the people in the lounge went their separate ways. `
`Doctor Nanjo, Battler-san and I went up to the second floor. `
`I then said good night to Doctor Nanjo. `
`At this time, of course, I put a seal on the door to the doctor's room as well." `
`"And it went unchanged until the crime was discovered. `
`I flew out of my room at the same time as Battler-san's scream `
`and checked to see that the door to Doctor Nanjo's room was still sealed. `
`Therefore, Doctor Nanjo's alibi is perfect both before 1:00 and after 3:00...!" `
`"Splendid, Erika. `
`{p:1:Both your seal and your red truth are perfect. `
`Nanjo had the alibi of being with Erika until {nobr:3 a.m}. `
`And he didn't leave his room after {nobr:3 a.m.} until morning}." `
`Erika made use of the seals on the doors `
`and was granted red truths from Bernkastel one after another... `
`For me, demanding that Beato repeat something had been about maneuvering and tactics, `
`...but it's totally different for Erika. `
`For her, it's like having a trump card that can make red whenever she wants... `
`"This concludes the proof of alibis for all suspects in the guesthouse. `
`...Any problems?" `
`"...I-I do have a problem...!! `
`And that problem is, ...umm......" `
`Beato racked her brains to find some point to latch onto, but Erika's red had been ruthlessly perfect. `
`...There was no point she could take issue with... `
`Beato kept thinking hard, trying to fault Erika on something, `
`but her expression was so wrought with desperation that anyone could tell by looking... `
`"Beato's complaint is rejected. `
`I can't sense any problems at all. `
`...It's totally <pop>, <cute>, and <perfect>! `
`Alibis for all humans in the guesthouse have now been proven." `
`"...Wait a sec, Erika. `
`Are you trying to leave me out of this? `
`Ushiromiya Battler also should've had a chance to commit the crime. `
`...After all, I was in the same room as the victims all night. `
`I'm not gonna let you skip past this part while ignoring me. `
`...?!" `
`At that time, an arrow twisted like a golden snake and hit me. `
`It didn't pierce through me, but it slapped me hard on the cheek like a whip. `
`"Battler-sama, your right to speak has not yet been recognized. `
`Be warned." `
`"...Oooww...dammit..." `
`"Yeah, I understand, Battler. `
`...And my apologies. Forgive me. `
`...Erika! `
`You still haven't shown an alibi for Battler! `
`Battler is the man who was sleeping alongside the victims. `
`Shouldn't he be placed under suspicion more than anyone else?!" `
`"Beato's right. `
`You can't go skipping Battler like that." `
`"My apologies. `
`I had completely forgotten." `
`"After Battler returned at 3:00 AM, you went up to the second floor with him. `
`And I believe you also went to your own room and slept. `
`You may have gone to the cousin room at 24:00, but I don't think you went there after 3:00 AM." `
`"...Will you now claim that you went to crawl into Battler's bed later on? `
`*cackle*cackle*! `
`Well, if you say you were looking at Battler's sleeping face all night long to confirm his alibi in the cousin room, `
`then I'd accept it, riiight?" `
`"Yes. I listened to him breathing in his sleep all night long. Got a problem with that?" `
`"...What...?!" `
`"I, Furudo Erika, can prove that Battler-san returned to the cousin room at 3:00 AM, `
`that he went straight to bed afterwards, and that he went straight to sleep. `
`And I can prove that until he woke up, noticed the gruesome situation the room was in, and let out a scream, nothing happened in that room." `
`"So you have no need to worry. `
`Battler-san isn't the culprit. `
`He's just the charming first discoverer, who entered the murder scene without realizing it was one and slept until morning." `
`"That's insane... `
`It shouldn't be possible for you to prove that with those seals you love so much...! `
`How can you prove this?!!" `
`"......That's ridiculous. `
`At that time, I entered the room alone. `
`Erika probably went into her room too. `
`How can she say something like that, as though she saw the whole thing...?!" `
`"She never said she saw it. `
`...The room Erika was assigned to... where was it located?" `
`"Erika, please tell me. `
`How can you prove so much about Battler?" `
`"......*giggle*giggle* `
`I'd expect no less from a true detective..." `
`"My room was right next to the cousin room. `
`There was only a single thin wall between them." `
`"...Y- `
`You don't mean... `
`...You...put your ear against the wall... `
`...to check what was happening in the cousin room...?" `
`"Yes. `
`My ears are perfect. `
`Right after Battler-san entered the room, I put my ear against the wall and checked to make sure nothing strange happened." `
`"...You said you could prove that nothing happened until Battler let out a scream the next morning... `
`...You don't mean..." `
`"Yes. `
`I put my ear against the wall and listened in on that room until morning, without sleeping a wink." `
`......Everyone... `
`was stunned into silence...... `
`She put her ear against the wall... `
`...and for the entire time until morning... `
`...she listened to what was going on in Battler's room... `
`Just what would that have looked like... `
`Until dawn, she had killed her breathing in a pitch-black room, `
`clinging to the wall shared with the cousin room... `
`Like some kind of creepy venomous spider clinging to the wall of a darkened room... `
`Bernkastel alone was grinning in triumph. `
`"...Due to the progression of the game, I realized that Battler, the one who had received the Head's Ring, would be a key player. `
`...I was sure that Battler would be a victim of the first twilight." `
`"Yes. `
`So, just as my master told me to do, `
`...I put my ear against the wall until morning without a wink of sleep, checking to make sure nothing unusual happened...!" `
`"Erika has a photographic memory. `
`And her hearing ability is on par with a tape recorder. `
`...It would have been impossible for him to deceive Erika's ears, either to kill George and the others or make those wounds on their throats." `
`"...It's an accepted power of the detective's authority. `
`I have no choice but to acknowledge it. `
`I'll confirm it in red...! `
`{p:1:Ushiromiya Battler returned to the cousins' room at {nobr:3 a.m.} and fell asleep. `
`After that, until the discovery of the crime, absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened in the room}!" `
`"{p:1:In other words, it was impossible for Battler to commit murder or damage the corpses}." `
`"......Nng, `
`...ggghh......" `
`The red from the pair forced Beato to show an expression of considerable anguish... `
`It was only natural. `
`Those red truths not only guaranteed Battler's alibi, but a number of other things as well. `
`First off, it meant the murder was impossible for anyone after 3:00 AM. `
`And since the cousins were confirmed to be alive as late as 24:00, the time period of the crime automatically became... `
`"between 24:00 and 3:00". `
`That meant the alibis for all people who weren't in the guesthouse before 3:00 AM... `
`had also been guaranteed automatically. `
`"...That one hurts... `
`...a lot......" `
`"After 24:00, Erika was in the guesthouse the whole time. `
`So, it should have been difficult for her to prove alibis for all of the people in the mansion..." `
`"It should've been almost impossible to prove alibis for Eva and the others. `
`...But now, all she has to do is prove that they never visited the guesthouse between 24:00 and 3:00, `
`and she can prove those alibis..." `
`"...Anyway, we'll have to construct it so that the murders were possible before 3:00 AM. `
`And we have to prove that it was possible for one of the people in the mansion to do it...!" `
`The people who had been in the guesthouse all had alibis. `
`The crime didn't occur before 24:00. `
`The crime couldn't have occurred after 3:00. `
`In other words, there was no way for the murders to happen unless someone from the mansion committed the crime between 24:00 and 3:00... `
`In order to protect Natsuhi, she had to establish that it was possible for someone other than Natsuhi to commit the crime. `
`Ironically, the witch had to prove that a Human had committed the crime... `
`"......Still, this is getting pretty difficult. `
`...Until 3:00, Erika was in the lounge. `
`And you have to pass through there to reach the second floor. `
`In other words, she's practically like a manager for the guesthouse's second floor." `
`"...This tactic may be a bit overused, but if it was possible for someone to go up to the second floor without Erika noticing, `
`we should be able to prove that the crime was possible for anyone." `
`"It's probably possible for a Human to climb up to a second story window if they really wanted to." `
`Of course, Beato had also thought of striking back that way. `
`...And Bernkastel must have thought this as well. `
`"Battler, Nanjo, Gohda, Kumasawa. `
`We realize that the crime was impossible for all these people in the guesthouse. `
`...However, what about the Humans in the mansion?!" `
`"As I have already said, and as my master has even proclaimed with the red truth, `
`I was in the lounge on the first floor of the guesthouse. `
`And to reach the second floor, one must pass through the lounge. `
`In other words, it was impossible to reach the second floor without me seeing it." `
`"And what if that wasn't impossible? `
`{p:2:For example, what if someone placed a ladder against the outer wall of the guesthouse and snuck in through a second‐story window?! `
`There must be a way to reach the second floor without passing through the lounge! `
`If this is the case, it would be possible to reach the crime scene without you seeing it}...!" `
`Beato finally struck back. `
`Before now, she'd let Erika take total control and attack her with the red over and over. `
`During that time, Beato's counterattacks with the blue truth had been few in number, even including this one... `
`"Of course, I knew you'd try saying that. `
`I couldn't have my lookout in the lounge become meaningless. `
`So first, I must prove that my lookout was perfect." `
`"...First off, because of how the guesthouse is constructed, `
`it's impossible to reach the second floor without me seeing it from the lounge. `
`There are no places under cover, nor are there any physical or mental blind spots. `
`...My master, repeat it!" `
`"{p:1:It is impossible for someone to reach the second floor of the guesthouse without anyone in the lounge noticing it. `
`......Though of course, this only refers to reaching the second floor from inside the building}." `
`"<Good>, my master! `
`...So, next is Lady Beatrice's theory that there might be a way to reach the second floor from the outside. `
`This really is a problem. `
`After all, there are trees that could probably be climbed, and someone could've used a ladder. `
`Even crawling up the rain gutter can't be ruled out as impossible. `
`But I {i:can't let you do that}." `
`"Hoh, you won't let me...? `
`And how's that? `
`Did you stay up all night circling the guesthouse? `
`No, you couldn't do that. `
`You were in the lounge...! `
`From the lounge, you can only see a small part of the outer perimeter through the window!" `
`"That's true. `
`I couldn't prevent all methods of climbing up to the second floor from the outside. `
`...However, I was able to prevent all entry to the second floor." `
`"Prevent...entry...?!" `
`"...I had already foreseen this move. `
`...How terrifying...that she would be so persistent...!" `
`"Because of how the guesthouse is constructed, the windows are the only method of entry from the outside to the second floor." `
`"The locks? Not important at all. `
`I only had to prove that none of the windows or shutters were opened even once. `
`After I witnessed the location of the hidden gold, `
`I returned to the guesthouse and immediately began severing all methods of entry to the second floor of the guesthouse that didn't pass through the lounge. `
`......Yes, it's exactly the same. `
`No different from the rest...!" `
`"...Don't tell me... `
`you used that seal of yours...on all the windows of the guesthouse...? `
`In that weather, ...dressed like that...?" `
`"Well, I did have my swimsuit from when I drifted here." `
`"......You're insane... `
`...At a house where you were welcomed as a guest, `
`you did something like that in the middle of the rain, even though nothing had happened yet...?" `
`"For a normal Human, it would have been an action so suspicious as to be completely impossible. `
`...However, she is the witch's piece." `
`In the middle of all that rain, `
`Erika sealed all the windows from the outside... `
`...to create an alibi showing that no one could've snuck into the guesthouse from the outside. `
`She climbed up the wall herself...and did that to all the windows on the first and second floor. `
`No, to all things that could possibly have permitted entry. `
`Although, after hearing that she'd listened to the cousin room all night long, without even sleeping a wink, `
`this new bizarre action didn't seem quite so impossible... `
`This had probably also...looked like a venomous spider. `
`A disgusting spider crawling over the outside guesthouse wall during a storm... `
`"......You... `
`...Just what do you... `
`...think of this Ushiromiya family...? `
`Is this how you repay us for welcoming you as a guest...?!" `
`"To a detective, the Ushiromiya family is nothing more or less than the stage upon which the crime occurs. `
`...Before the outbreak of the crime, it was important for me to memorize the names of the characters, memorize the layout of the land, `
`and prepare for the upcoming crime by devoting my time towards collecting and creating all possible alibis." `
`"From my perspective, detectives who don't prepare anything before the outbreak of the crime are pretty third-rate. `
`After all, we all know that someone will die wherever we spend the night." `
`"......Furthermore, at the time the crime was discovered, `
`Erika confirmed that none of those seals had been broken. `
`That's why Erika wasn't the first one to reach the cousin room when the corpses were found." `
`"Even without inspecting the corpses, she could be certain of several things thanks to the red truth. `
`It was more important to check the seals and construct alibis." `
`"My master is perfect. `
`All I did was prove everything perfectly by following my master's orders...!" `
`"Well done, Erika. `
`My double, my piece...! `
`What do you think, Lambda? `
`Doesn't this prove that Erika's lookout in the lounge contains absolute reliability as far as constructing alibis...?" `
`"...Yeah, I acknowledge it. `
`Erika, your seal is perfect. `
`I'll acknowledge it in red. `
`{p:1:It was impossible to reach the second floor of the guesthouse without passing through the lounge, `
`and impossible to reach it at all without Erika, who was in the lounge, knowing about it}!" `
`"Thank you very much, Lady Lambdadelta...! `
`So, you know what's coming next, Great Lady Beatrice! `
`{p:2:Therefore, the time of the crime is limited to the single hour between midnight, when they were confirmed to be alive, `
`and {nobr:1 a.m.}, when our party in the lounge started}!" `
`"Uu, `
`...gah `
`...ah..." `
`"I've already said it, but at 24:00, I went down to the lounge, `
`hit it off with Doctor Nanjo, and was engrossed by a discussion of the mystery genre in the library until 1:00 AM." `
`"...It's a bit embarrassing, but I grew so wrapped up in that discussion... `
`that I wouldn't have noticed if anyone had passed through the corridor during that period. `
`...Quite a regretful mistake for a detective." `
`After doing all that maneuvering and setting up seals to guarantee a perfect alibi, `
`she became too engrossed in a mystery discussion and left an opening...? `
`Her relaxed smile was completely shameless, the total opposite of her words. `
`It almost seems like it's the other way around. `
`It's enough to make you think that this was an intentional trap... `
`...to make it clear to all that only Natsuhi didn't have an alibi between 24:00 and 1:00... `
`"In other words, it paradoxically means this: `
`the only ones who could have reached the cousin room and committed the crime...are those characters who have no alibi between 24:00 and 1:00!" `
`Her eyes clearly hinted that Natsuhi was the only one who fit this description... `
`...It should've been a crime whose time and location were completely unknown during that long night. `
`But because of the alibis Erika had constructed, `
`it had been limited to the time period between 24:00 and 1:00. `
`Erika left the cousin room at 24:00. `
`That marks the last confirmation that George and the others were alive. `
`And after the party in the lounge started at 1:00, `
`it was impossible to reach the cousin room by any method. `
`"......Damn her, ...and from a mere Human..." `
`"This is quite bad... `
`The night has been sealed up into an hour, ...and at this rate, there won't be many suspect pieces left..." `
`"...Damn it, Lady Bernkastel... `
`...Nicely done..." `
`"Unlike Battler, I'm not an idiot. `
`...After watching this game five times, I've got more than enough cards in my hand. `
`... `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!" `
`"Then let us continue. `
`Let's examine the alibis of the remaining suspects, the people in the mansion. `
`After all, we only have to worry about the single hour between 24:00 and 1:00. `
`That shouldn't be difficult at all." `
`"Let's start with 24:00. `
`At this time, Natsuhi, Krauss, and Genji are in the second floor corridor, and all of the others are in the first floor dining hall. `
`This has already been shown by my master's red!" `
`"Yeah, that's right. `
`{p:1:At 24:00, Natsuhi, Krauss, and Genji were in the corridor on the second floor of the mansion. `
`The rest of them were in the dining hall on the first floor}. `
`And as you know, there was a mysterious knock, and a letter with the One Wing seal on it appeared. `
`The discussion surrounding that continued on until 1:00. `
`I will say it with the red truth. `
`{p:1:Of all the people in the dining hall, not one of them left the dining hall until {nobr:1 a.m.}}...!" `
`Since the possible times for the crime had been limited to between 24:00 and 1:00... `
`The adults in the family conference, who were confirmed not to have left the mansion between 24:00 and 1:00, `
`all had proven alibis. `
`"...A-And how do you intend to prove that?! `
`Erika's in the guesthouse! `
`Did someone prove it by using one of your favorite seals on the dining hall door?! `
`You have no convincing evidence or proof...!!" `
`"{p:1:The red truth is simply truth, and there is no need to provide evidence, proof, or room for a counterargument}!! `
`......You made that rule. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle* *giggle*giggle*giggle* ehehehehehahahahahahahahahahaha...!!" `
`This overbearing red truth hadn't only given alibis to the adults in the dining hall. `
`It also gave alibis to Shannon and Kanon, who had come to serve tea, `
`and even guaranteed that they never left the dining hall. `
`In other words, ...the only ones who didn't have proven alibis... `
`were these three: Natsuhi, Krauss, and Genji... `
`No, ...there were only two left. `
`If Krauss and Genji had their alibis proven, `
`it proves that no one but Natsuhi could've been the culprit...! `
`"Let's do Genji next. `
`He's a victim, but you can't deny the possibility that he committed the crime in the cousin room and was then killed himself." `
`"And furthermore, though he was in the second floor corridor at 24:00, `
`he then returned to the servant room to transfer the phone call for Natsuhi and was completely isolated." `
`"Which means it was possible for Genji to commit the-" `
`"I'll say it in red. `
`{p:1:When Genji finished transferring the call, he immediately returned to the servants' quarters}. `
`That's just a cold, hard truth, without any evidence, proof, seals or alibis, got it?" `
`"Then, at 1:00 AM, `
`there was another break in the family conference, and Rosa returned to the guesthouse. `
`...At that time... `
`I'm truly thankful for your cooperation, Ushiromiya Eva-san. `
`Please rise...!" `
`"......Erika-chan wasn't the only one, okay? `
`I was also certain that something would happen that night." `
`"She's the person who taught me how to make those seals. `
`And she helped me to check the alibis of those people under suspicion...!" `
`"During the break at 1:00 AM, `
`I went to Genji-san's waiting room and used the same seal as Erika-chan...! `
`In other words, if that wasn't broken, `
`it would mean no one entered or left that room between 1:00 AM and the next morning...!!" `
`"Now, Kanon-san and Kumasawa-san. `
`Please rise." `
`Kanon rose expressionlessly, and Kumasawa got to her feet timidly. `
`"In the morning, `
`you two went to wake Genji-san because he had slept in, right? `
`And at that time, you noticed that the door was sealed, broke the seal, and opened the door, correct?" `
`"...Y-Yes. `
`...I thought it was some kind of prank." `
`"I didn't think deeply about it at the time." `
`"I'm not asking for your opinions. Just give us the facts. `
`Did you break the seal and enter the room?" `
`""Y-Yes..."" `
`"With the red truth, I'll guarantee that Eva, Kanon, and Kumasawa's statements just now are the truth. `
`{p:1:At {nobr:1 a.m.}, Eva sealed Genji's sleeping quarters, and that seal was broken by Kanon and Kumasawa in the morning when the crime was discovered}. `
`This'll be a pain, so I'll add on some more. `
`"{p:1:During the short break at {nobr:1 a.m.}, the first two to leave the dining hall were Rosa and Eva. `
`Until Eva returned, everyone in the dining hall remained there. `
`After seeing Rosa off, Eva went to the sleeping quarters and sealed it. `
`Of course, she did not enter the room at all at this time}." `
`"This is all information gathered from the people involved. `
`It isn't a red truth without a basis. `
`It's a truth due to proper reasoning constructed from testimony. `
`Not only testimony, but the limits of scientific investigations such as collecting fingerprints were used here." `
`"After all, Kinzo-san's study is a treasure vault with all kinds of chemicals! `
`I obtained all sorts of results to create an ultimate truth, infinitely close to a red truth. `
`This isn't a science mystery, so I'll spare you the details." `
`As Erika swaggered around the cathedral, she arrogantly touted her scientific knowledge. `
`She had thorough knowledge of all the chemicals in Kinzo's study and had used them to conduct a scientific investigation, `
`which had now been acknowledged and made into a red truth by Bernkastel. `
`...She didn't explain the details, but she had obtained results that were convincing even without the red truth. `
`Collecting fingerprints with aluminum powder. `
`Component analysis of the mud under someone's shoe and various chemical reactions from the clinging rain water. `
`...Erika just walked into someone else's study several times... `
`and used several chemicals however she pleased, all without asking the family's permission. `
`However, no one could fault her for this. `
`The pieces couldn't hinder any action the detective might take for the investigation. `
`That's the power of the detective's authority. `
`"......You act like you own the place... `
`...From now on, I'll tell everyone I meet. If someone claims to be a detective, never welcome them into your house as a guest." `
`"That's probably a good idea. `
`Giving shelter to a detective is just about the worst omen of misfortune out there." `
`"......Because of this, `
`it has been proven that it was only possible to reach Genji's waiting room `
`and commit the crime between 24:00 and 1:00 AM. `
`And furthermore, by Erika's investigation, it has been proven that it was impossible for Genji to reach the cousin room." `
`It had already been made clear in red that, after transferring the phone call to Natsuhi, `
`Genji had gone straight back to the waiting room. `
`And because of Erika's scientific investigation, further red had been added, saying `
`{p:1:Genji never left the mansion after 24:00}... `
`Because of this, it's been made clear that Genji couldn't have reached the guesthouse, `
`much less the cousin room... `
`"Now, ...only Krauss and Natsuhi remain...! `
`Everyone else has had their alibis proven, haven't they?!!" `
`"...I- `
`Impossible...... `
`.........!" `
`Natsuhi's mouth flapped open and shut like a suffocating goldfish. `
`And that's an accurate analogy. `
`...Natsuhi's mind was blank and spinning out of control, and she felt as though she really would suffocate. `
`"...Ushiromiya Natsuhi, `
`...I'll give you one last chance. `
`Confess that all of the crimes were the work of your husband." `
`"...F-Fool!! `
`Do I look like the kind of woman who would falsely accuse her husband?!!" `
`"...Beato, `
`Natsuhi's denied it. `
`I'll give you the same chance. `
`...You understand, right? `
`...Or wait, don't tell me... `
`You aren't going to take advantage of the fact that Krauss is missing to try and pull a Devil's Proof on me, are you...?" `
`"......Gah, ghh......" `
`Beato realized that they were rapidly approaching the end of this battle. `
`Normally, Beato should've been able to argue against these alibis of Erika's in several ways, using the blue truth. `
`However, all of those alibis had been accepted by Bernkastel and Lambdadelta as red truth, `
`and Beato no longer had any room to argue... `
`"...It's like...... `
`those witches are distorting things, so that they match with a plotline Erika's drawn up..." `
`"That's right. `
`If the Game Master, Lady Lambdadelta, accepts a truth, `
`its authenticity will not be questioned. `
`The world that comes after will be formed based on the final remaining truth. ...This happens no matter how far this final truth is from the real truth." `
`"There's no way Uncle Krauss is the culprit. `
`He's being held prisoner somewhere. `
`...W-Wait, `
`we can't deny the possibility that Aunt Natsuhi was skillfully tricked into believing that during the phone call..." `
`"Do you suspect Natsuhi and Krauss, Battler-kun?" `
`"Well......" `
`"Erika's truth has been constructed in a cowardly fashion, but it is a proper truth. `
`Though the witches did conspire with her, it has still been acknowledged as a red truth. `
`In other words, it cannot be a fake truth built solely on lies." `
`"...This means that even Erika's truth is supported by logic. `
`The truth about Natsuhi and Krauss being culprits is also very possible. `
`Even if it's a mixture of truth and lies, it "makes sense logically". `
`...It's a mixture of truth and lies...that is just as valuable as truth is. `
`...Which of those two truths will you believe? `
`That is up to you to decide." `
`"......No. `
`...I'll......trust Aunt Natsuhi...and Uncle Krauss. `
`I realize they're in some money trouble." `
`"But even so, ...I don't want to believe that they're the culprits. `
`No, I can't believe it...!" `
`"On this game board, where the red is steadily cornering Natsuhi, how do you intend to let her escape?" `
`"...I-I don't know... `
`However, ...I seriously don't want to give up...! `
`Aunt Natsuhi was just caught in a cowardly trap. `
`...Erika's reasoning has fallen for that trap completely...! `
`So whether it's intentional or she's being manipulated, Erika is aiding the true culprit." `
`"......Erika has accused Aunt Natsuhi of being the culprit, ...but even if everyone here believes that, `
`...in fact, for that very reason, I want to be the one person who trusts Aunt Natsuhi...!" `
`If everyone believes it's her, will that become the truth? `
`If everyone accepts a lie, will that become the truth? `
`Must an honest person be dragged up to the guillotine, `
`all alone and taunted by liars? `
`"I...don't like it. `
`...If no one else will believe in Aunt Natsuhi, then I will...!! `
`The real truth isn't something that's determined when everyone accepts it! `
`It's something you find after thoroughly investigating both possibilities...! `
`So this trial is a downright lie! `
`This trial exists for no reason other than to set Aunt Natsuhi up as the culprit!!" `
`"...Beato is doing all she can to plead Natsuhi's case, right?" `
`"Wrong. `
`Beato is trying to refute Erika's argument. `
`...She's just defending! `
`You can't fight in this trial by simply resisting all of your opponent's claims. `
`This is why Beato always cornered me in the past...!" `
`"She isn't gonna beat Erika by finding flaws in her reasoning! `
`She has to find a different truth and show Lambdadelta, the commander of this game, `
`... `
`that her truth is more correct than Erika's...!!" `
`"Can anyone create a truth where Natsuhi isn't the culprit, `
`without violating the red truths that Lady Bernkastel has shown...?" `
`"...I-I don't know... `
`But...as long as I don't believe that Aunt Natsuhi is the culprit, there's got to be a different truth!" `
`"It's even okay if the culprit for the crime was a witch. `
`That's better than having Natsuhi be framed by an incorrect truth...!!" `
`"......So, no matter how much red truth you are shown, `
`you won't believe that Natsuhi is the culprit, correct?" `
`"Yeah...! `
`For all things, there should always be some people who believe and some who don't...! `
`No matter how much evidence is stacked up against her, someone has to believe that she's innocent! `
`There must be several truths in the world that cannot be proven with evidence. `
`I don't ever want to accept that something's true just because everyone says it is!!" `
`How can you be sure that there's nothing on the back side of the moon if you've never seen it?! `
`Is there some reason that you have to believe it?! `
`Until you see the back of the moon with your own eyes, `
`you can deny neither the possibility that nothing's there at all... `
`nor the possibility that there's a thriving culture of space bunnies...! `
`You should never assume something is the truth until you actually check it. `
`This court is a malicious thing, trying to force a single interpretation on a truth that cannot be checked. `
`I believed there was a civilization on the back side of the moon!! `
`But that was in elementary school, and I was made fun of and laughed at. `
`So I thought it was embarrassing to think that a civilization lived on the moon, `
`...and I threw away that "belief". `
`I'd been told by a book my mom read me that rabbits lived on the back side of the moon, `
`so I believed that for a long, long time. `
`...But when everyone said it was wrong, `
`I abandoned that truth without even trying to check it! `
`...Even without evidence, `
`I abandoned the truth I believed in...! `
`And now, everyone is starting to believe that Aunt Natsuhi is the culprit. `
`Even though no decisive evidence has been shown...! `
`Even without evidence, Erika's words sound reasonable, so they're probably the truth...? `
`Is {i:that} why you're throwing away your "belief" that Aunt Natsuhi is innocent, despite a lack of proof?! `
`"If no one else will believe, ...then I will...! `
`I believe the real truth only appears if you look with both eyes, one denying and one affirming...!! `
`No matter how much she tries to make us believe that Aunt Natsuhi is the culprit, I believe she isn't! `
`I won't abandon that belief!!" `
`".........Understood. `
`Then I will give you just a single red truth. `
`I will give this single bit of power to you, now that you possess the will to fight in the truest sense." `
`"Power......?" `
`"By the name of the Finite Witch Virgilia. `
`......No, as the former witch Beatrice, I will grant you this red truth. `
`{a:c: `
`"{p:1:Ushiromiya Natsuhi is not the culprit}!"} `
`"............!!!!" `
`"A plea bargain. `
`...If you acknowledge that Krauss is the culprit, `
`Erika will suspend her pursuit of Natsuhi. `
`From then on, the investigation will proceed assuming that Krauss, whose location is unknown, is the culprit." `
`"What'll you do, Beato? `
`At this rate, Natsuhi's in serious trouble, right? `
`...Will you accept the plea bargain? `
`If you're willing to abandon this Ushiromiya family honor thing, `
`Bern'll be kind enough to let you get off with a draw, okay...?" `
`Krauss is currently missing, and it's unknown whether he's alive or dead. `
`Like Kinzo, he's no different than a "cat in a box" that has disappeared into the mists of the island. `
`A cat inside a box is unfixed, and no interpretation of it can be denied. `
`It is the root of endless interpretations. `
`The true source of the Endless Witch's power. `
`In other words, no matter how much Bernkastel claims that Krauss is the culprit, `
`...she can't make that the sole truth. `
`In other words, the Krauss culprit theory and the witch theory can be in almost perfect balance. `
`...It would mean making the game a draw. `
`Bernkastel was......tempting her. `
`This was cajolery, ...offering her a second chance if she abandons the honor of the family she swore to protect... `
`and consents to a Fragment that stomps all over that honor. `
`There's no room for false confidence. `
`For Beato, to lose is to die. `
`...In this game, she should always choose a draw unless she has an overwhelming advantage. `
`"...Mu, ...uu......" `
`"I won't allow you to treat my husband like the culprit!! `
`My husband is the Successor to the Ushiromiya Family Headship!! `
`The only person who will inherit the glory of the Ushiromiya family! `
`I will never let you treat him like a criminal...!!" `
`"...Are you sure, Natsuhi...? `
`......If you refuse to suspect Krauss, ...then...you'll be the only one left. `
`...Alibis have been proven for everyone else, ...in other words, Hempel's Raven...! `
`Even without any evidence, ...it will be determined that you are the culprit...!" `
`"And if I'm the only one left, what then?! `
`I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi!! `
`I will not run or hide! `
`I am innocent!! `
`And I am the representative of the noble Head, with the One-Winged Eagle engraved into my heart!!" `
`"If you wish to insult me, go ahead! `
`If you wish to ridicule me, do as you please!! `
`No one can damage my honor with a mixture of truth and lies!!" `
`With a dignified voice, ...Natsuhi stated her case openly before the witches above her. `
`However, this response of hers `
`might've been exactly what Bernkastel had intended... `
`"...Natsuhi refuses the deal. `
`......And you, Beato? `
`...You understand, right? `
`The instant Natsuhi is specified as the culprit, Lambda will make her verdict. `
`As soon as that happens, the Illusion of the Witch will be denied, and you'll disappear into the mist. `
`...Do you plan to let Natsuhi's foolish bragging drag you down to the depths of hell...?" `
`"......Nn......gah......" `
`"...Riiche, `
`you fought well. `
`...This is our chance. `
`Convince Natsuhi and try to work out a compromise...!" `
`"Both Lady Lambdadelta and Lady Bernkastel have boredom, not you, as their true enemy. `
`...They probably want to have this game repeat and play some more. `
`If they see that you're willing to make a concession, `
`they will most likely accept it gladly and move on to the next game." `
`"If we move on to the next game, ......then what will happen to the Natsuhi of this game, `
`...the Natsuhi of this Fragment...?" `
`"Now isn't the time to be worrying about that, right?! `
`Natsuhi is just a piece! `
`Even if she gets removed from this game, she'll show up again in the next one!" `
`"But that doesn't apply to you, Milady... `
`I believe you know what Lady Bernkastel plans for this game. `
`It's a more realistic goal to make use of that and aim for victory in the next game instead. `
`...Accepting Lady Bernkastel's deal might be our one and only good option right now...!" `
`"Throw away that useless pride of yours!! `
`Neither Kasparov nor Deep Blue won every game! `
`The person that wins more games wins in the end, right?! `
`If a witch gets too attached to a single match, a single life, a single piece, `
`...that witch dies!!" `
`".........My apologies, `
`......but I cannot do that. `
`......I know the strength of a man who believed even though everyone said he was wrong, `
`...and I know the suffering he went through when he was forced to abandon that belief...!" `
`"I will not abandon Natsuhi! `
`Why? `
`Because if everyone else suspects Natsuhi, then someone has to believe in her! `
`Because truth can only be found in the gap between those who doubt and those who believe...!!" `
`"I won't abandon her! `
`Even if everyone believes that Natsuhi is the culprit, I will still claim that I, the witch, am the culprit...!! `
`If I can't even make that claim, my existence isn't worth anything...!!" `
`"...I cannot lose. `
`The truth isn't something anyone gets to deny. `
`...Only when you doubt and abandon it yourself does it disappeeeeeeear!!" `
`"Is that your answer, Beato...?" `
`"Yeah, of course I refuse!! `
`Ushiromiya Krauss is not the culprit!!" `
`"......Fool. `
`I won't let you take that back, okay...? `
`Here's what you get for being a quick-tempered moron. `
`By the name of Bernkastel, Witch of Miracles, I speak with the red truth. `
`{p:1:Ushiromiya Krauss is not the culprit. `
`And he was killed long ago. `
`Shortly after you heard his voice over the phone, in fact}." `
`"...N-No...... `
`...D-Dear, ......aaah...aaagghhhaaaaaaaaahhhh......" `
`Bernkastel's cruel and ruthless red blade gouged Natsuhi... `
`...It was...totally merciless...... `
`Natsuhi had been crushed with uncertainty, not knowing whether Krauss was alive or dead, ...but she had still been capable of believing that he was alive... `
`And now, ...that hope, ...that expectation...had been crushed, ...without any chance for a miracle...!! `
`She had thrown herself into this trap out of concern for her husband's safety. `
`She had now lost her daughter and husband......and everything she had gained since marrying into the Ushiromiya family. `
`No, ...even after all this, `
`......one thing still remains. `
`If her husband has been lost, ......then right now, she is the last person who can protect the honor of the Ushiromiya family. `
`She still...couldn't let it end here...... `
`Even wrapped up in so much sadness, ...Natsuhi would do all she could to protect that honor... `
`with this final bit of strength... `
`"Nope, it's all over! `
`It's been determined with the red truth that none of the remaining people in the dining hall left that room until 1:00. `
`In other words, alibis have already been proven for everyone except Natsuhi!" `
`"...Well done, Erika and Bernkastel! `
`You've fully proven that the crime was impossible for everyone except Ushiromiya Natsuhi! `
`Why don't I start reading aloud from the verdict?" `
`"...At 24:00 on October 4th, 1986, the defendant, Ushiromiya Natsuhi, `
`left before the others while pretending to return to her room to sleep, `
`and murdered George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, and Genji one after another during the one-hour period before 1:00 AM!" `
`"Let me tack something on. `
`Due to circumstantial evidence, include the murder of Krauss." `
`"Yeah, that's right. `
`In this situation, it's unthinkable that anyone except Natsuhi could kill Krauss!! `
`A revision to the verdict! `
`During the hour before 1:00 AM, `
`Krauss, George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, and Genji were killed one after another! `
`It's only possible for any of these murders to have taken place between 24:00 and 1:00! `
`The only person without an alibi during this time was Ushiromiya Natsuhi...! `
`From this point forward, the defendant will be treated as the true culprit." `
`"Furthermore, because it has been fully proven that the crime was possible for Humans, `
`Beatrice, Endless Witch...!! `
`This Court of Illusions hereby denies your existence!!" `
`"You'll be given a chance to plead your case, but can you prove an alibi for Natsuhi? `
`Or can you prove that it was possible for someone other than Natsuhi? `
`If you can do that, Natsuhi will stop at being one shade short of absolutely guilty, `
`and the denial of your existence will be put on hold for this game..." `
`If Natsuhi had an alibi, Beato would've shown it long ago. `
`In fact, wasn't the whole point of that trap to make her lose her alibi...? `
`"Even if her alibi is not proven, ...I will believe in Natsuhi's innocence...!! `
`No matter how much you try to pin your fake truth on her!! `
`I am the true culprit! `
`Natsuhi is innocent!! `
`Even without any proof!!" `
`"...The truth is known only by the master of the night on this island, Beatrice the Golden. `
`I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi! `
`Now that my husband has passed away, I am the Head of the Ushiromiya family!! `
`My determination will not bend no matter how you try and humiliate me!" `
`"Why, you ask? `
`It is because Father gave me permission to engrave the family crest of the One-Winged Eagle into my heart...!! `
`How do you intend to disprove the existence of this honor with your evidence and your alibis? `
`You cannot!! `
`The Ushiromiya family crest engraved into my heart is immortal!!" `
`......Now that Natsuhi and Beatrice `
`had practically been placed on the guillotine, `
`...they cried out with all the strength of their determination... `
`However, that did nothing but bring a cold smile to Lambdadelta's face. `
`Erika had constructed a truth that Lambdadelta could accept. `
`...And no one could construct a more convincing truth to deny Erika's. `
`In that case, the most convincing truth would swallow up everything else...and become the one and only "truth". `
`Even if it happened to be different from the real truth. `
`The truth of those in the past is swallowed up by the truth of those in the future. `
`...This can happen even for a mixture of truth and lies. `
`As long as everyone acknowledges it as true...! `
`"......Sheesh, stop howling already. `
`...I like it best when witches sob and beg for their lives when they're about to be burned at the stake. `
`When they try and bluff like you do, it's such a killjoy. `
`In that case, I guess I'll send you one final gift. A red truth to smash that bluff wide open." `
`"...Wh-What do you mean......?" `
`"...S- `
`Stop it, ...Lady Bernkastel... `
`...Hasn't it already been overwritten with the truth you wished for...? `
`That truth and Natsuhi's should be able to coexist... `
`Please don't defile it, `
`......please........." `
`"{p:1:Natsuhi. `
`When did Kinzo ever say it was okay for you to engrave the One‐winged Eagle into your heart? `
`Those were just the words of the Kinzo from your delusions. `
`......The real Kinzo? `
`Throughout his entire life, not {i:once}... `
`did he ever trust you from the bottom of his heart, `
`and not once did he ever consider letting you bear the family crest}!" `
`When that heartless announcement was made, ......Kinzo stood up. `
`"Natsuhi!! You need not listen to this!! `
`No one can defile the crest engraved in your heart!! `
`That is yours alone!! `
`Don't let your pride as the final Family Head be forgotten forever! `
`Natsuhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!" `
`"Just shut up and disappear. `
`You miserable delusion of Natsuhi's." `
`"Nngggaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!! `
`You cannot erase me! You cannot erase my soul!! `
`Not as long as the crest is engraved into Natsuhi's heart!!" `
`"That's enough, you lying illusion. `
`{p:1:The real Kinzo would never say such a thing. `
`Begone, `
`you fantasy of Kinzo inside Natsuhi's mind, beautified by her to suit her own purposes}." `
`"Gwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhaaaaaaaahhhh, `
`Na... `
`tsuhi... `
`nnggwoooooooooooohhhhhhh...!!!" `
`A bright red flash of lightning smashed Kinzo over and over again as he screamed. `
`Then, he crumpled like a doll...and sat back down in his chair as though nothing had happened. `
`The fierce emotion had left Kinzo's face. `
`He had truly...become like a wax model. `
`And so, ......he would never again share kind words with Natsuhi... `
`......That's right. `
`The true Kinzo... `
`never once trusted Natsuhi during his entire life. `
`The true Kinzo... `
`...never once considered allowing Natsuhi to bear the One-Winged Eagle. `
`...Because, of course... `
`Kinzo had already vanished before the start of the game. `
`The Kinzo that appears in this game... `
`......is nothing more than Natsuhi's... `
`...delusion... `
`Every part of this Kinzo, `
`...who believed in Natsuhi and entrusted her with protecting the family honor... `
`was a phantom... `
`...created by Natsuhi...... `
`"{p:1:Pitiful woman. `
`Now is the time for you to face the truth that you never gained Ushiromiya Kinzo's trust as long as he lived}." `
`"Wah... `
`...waaah..." `
`"...Natsuhi, `
`...don't cry. `
`...Kinzo... `
`entrusted the Ushiromiya family... `
`to you, right...?" `
`...No, he didn't. `
`Not only did he not entrust her with that, `
`...he never even said hello... `
`...or met her gaze even once...... `
`"...Uu, ...uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh...!! `
`Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!" `
`Natsuhi's cry was `
`a mixture of sadness and many other emotions, `
`...and it echoed throughout the cathedral... `
`...Natsuhi could no longer stop her tears. `
`Some last, faint element that had cheered her up until today, `
`that had allowed her to endure as an Ushiromiya, as the wife to the Head's representative, ...and as the final Family Head... `
`...had been torn to bits... `
`Natsuhi no longer... `
`...had anything left. `
`Natsuhi could no longer allow herself...to even call herself an Ushiromiya...... `
`Those difficult days, those painful days. `
`Those days where she still gave everything she could for the family she'd married into despite it all. `
`...The very few happy days among these. `
`All of these flitted through her mind, one after another... `
`...and disappeared. `
`All of those once-beautiful memories... `
`were then...crushed by Bernkastel's red truth, `
`......smashed to bits and scattered, `
`...plunged deep into her hands, `
`...and smeared red with mournful blood... `
`...It was... `
`the red of sadness `
`and truth. `
`"That is all. `
`...Just because the crime exists as it does, `
`this level of reasoning is possible for Furudo Erika. `
`...What do you think, everyone...?" `
`Lambdadelta...clapped. `
`Then, a bit later, Bernkastel also clapped, looking pleased. `
`The expressionless, wax figure-like audience followed suit, `
`and the unshakable verdict was welcomed with a great applause...... `
`And so, ......the "truth" of this tale... `
`was decided...... `
`Right now, no humans exist on this island except for those in this parlor. `
`And, with one exception, it has been shown that none of them have committed murder. `
`And, the culprit is among these people. `
`"...Whoa, whoa. `
`...In that case, ...it's conclusive, isn't it...?" `
`"Unless the culprit is a witch who committed murder with magic, that is..." `
`"...It was you?! `
`You killed George, killed my husband?! `
`Why?!! `
`Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?!!" `
`"...I-I didn't kill anyone...! `
`I-I...d-didn't...!!" `
`"..............." `
`In a panic, and with a voice that was far from calm, `
`......in a manner that was, to put it coldly, unsightly...Aunt Natsuhi denied the suspicion placed upon her... `
`However, ...there was no longer any way around it... `
`{i:She} stood up, ...brushed back her long hair, pointed at Aunt Natsuhi, and said it one more time. `
`"...You're the culprit, `
`Ushiromiya Natsuhi-san." `
`Red-faced and tear-streaked, `
`...Eva walked up to Natsuhi... `
`and grabbed her by the collar. `
`Then, wordlessly, she slapped Natsuhi's cheek. `
`Natsuhi, who had never been slapped in her life, `
`was shocked by the taste of iron, which she was feeling for the first time. `
`It turned into a scuffle between Eva and Natsuhi. `
`Battler immediately tried to stop them, `
`but Eva planted a sharp knee into Battler's gut and he doubled over. `
`"Give them back, give back George and my husband!! `
`Why did you kill them?! `
`You murderer, murdereeeeeeeer!!" `
`Sobbing, Eva kicked Natsuhi, who had fallen to the ground, over and over. `
`Battler tried once more to cut in and stop them, but he was brushed aside, `
`...and after that, no one tried to stop them. `
`Repeating her son and husband's names over and over, Eva kicked Natsuhi. `
`And kicked her. `
`Then she started grabbing whatever her eyes fell upon and throwing it. `
`...Natsuhi was hit with a steaming teacup... `
`and a can of black tea, whose tea leaves fell out all over her. `
`She was kicked, her hair pulled and dragged up, `
`her cheek slapped so many times that it started to swell. `
`No one tried to stop it. `
`It wasn't because they were worried about Eva kicking them too. `
`It was because they thought it an appropriate act of retribution for a person who had lost her beloved son and husband. `
`A proper...retribution. `
`A proper...truth. `
`Everyone in the parlor accepted that Natsuhi was the culprit... `
`...They accepted the truth Erika claimed. `
`So it became a proper truth, and Natsuhi was designated as the proper culprit. `
`She had already lost the husband and daughter who might have protected her, `
`...and even Kinzo, who should have given her a final bit of strength, had already vanished like a bubble in the ocean of illusions... `
`No longer...would anyone protect her. `
`No longer...would anyone believe her. So she was now...the true culprit. `
`Eva's shoulders heaved with her heavy breathing. `
`...Apparently, her anger still hadn't abated. `
`Erika patted her shoulder and made Eva take a step back. `
`...Of course, this wasn't to protect Natsuhi from violence. `
`It was to further humiliate Natsuhi, ...now that she had been branded as the culprit. `
`"Natsuhi-san, `
`I've solved two of the three riddles. `
`The "who dunnit". `
`And the "how dunnit". `
`The final riddle--the "why dunnit"--must always be confessed by the culprit herself. `
`Please follow the rules of the mystery genre and confess." `
`The "why dunnit"...refers to the motive. `
`"If this was a third-rate mystery, `
`...you would let out a high-pitched laugh about now, confess to the crime, `
`and start telling the story of her sad past. `
`...Don't tell me you intend to make me explain that part as well?" `
`"...I am not the culprit!! `
`Someone, believe me!! `
`I just had my husband taken hostage, was threatened, ...and fell into a trap...!!" `
`Natsuhi, with her hair a mess and her face red and tear-streaked, `
`...protested to everyone, `
`...but no one met her gaze. `
`Because it has already been resolved that Natsuhi was the culprit. `
`Because Lambdadelta had acknowledged that the culprit of the tale was Natsuhi and had woven it that way, `
`none of the pieces would pay any heed to Natsuhi's...to "the culprit's" words... `
`"Natsuhi isn't the culprit!! `
`I am the Golden Witch, Beatrice!! `
`I am the one who commands Rokkenjima's night and who has reigned since long before the time you were all still scared of the dark!" `
`"Why can't you just call it my sin? Why must you suspect Natsuhi?!! `
`Acknowledge me!! `
`I committed all the crimes!! `
`There's no way a Human is the culpriiiiiiiiiit!!" `
`The Illusion of the Witch had already been crushed, ...and Beato's voice didn't reach anyone. `
`The verdict had already been made. `
`......Everything had been decided. `
`"No one can hear you. `
`You're a phantom, a mere illusion! `
`Go back to being a simple portrait! `
`You're a faint phantom of a witch, born when Kinzo shared his illusion with his relatives!! `
`That is the truth chosen by this world!!" `
`"So, Great Lady Lambdadelta!! `
`Now is the time for you to bury the ridiculous and foolish illusion that this witch claims is the truth...!!" `
`"Goodbye, Beatrice. `
`......I made you a witch expecting that you'd either become my friend `
`or help distract me from my boredom. `
`And you've answered to my expectations. `
`The second one, that is. `
`...Heheheheheheheheheheheheheh!!" `
`"...I... `
`...am a witch... `
`Even if Lady Lambdadelta doesn't acknowledge it, `
`...I'm a witch......" `
`"Oh, sure, but you wouldn't even be capable of believing that if I hadn't become your guardian in the first place...!! `
`Yep, this is "game over" for you. `
`You'll be buried in accordance with the rules of your game board. `
`...What happens to the losers in your game, again...?" `
`"Beato has already shown that clearly in a previous game. `
`You get made into a mound of living flesh before being tossed into the goats' dinner party and getting chewed to bits." `
`"Now there's a fitting end for you, Beatrice. `
`And I did come all the way here just to hear the death cries of one as haughty as you...!!" `
`One by one, a massive number of goat attendants `
`slipped out from the shadows of the pillars and began to fill the cathedral. `
`The goats paid no attention to Natsuhi, who was seated in the center, `
`but the crowd completely enveloped her. `
`From Beato's point of view up on the balcony, `
`...it probably looked like a huge boiling pot of goats. `
`".........Heh, `
`...*cackle*, `
`...hahahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`That's right, `
`...the contract has been like this since the beginning...!" `
`"Yep. `
`Our contract said that whenever you stopped entertaining me, `
`you would relieve me of my boredom with your life!" `
`"Come, strip the title of witch from this woman and throw her into the pot of goats!!" `
`Suddenly, there were goats standing right behind Beato. `
`...They lifted her up roughly. `
`"Let me hear some nice screams. `
`You're the wine I've been fermenting all this time." `
`"...Then perhaps refusing your request will be my final strike back at you..." `
`"Yeah! I made her say it! `
`Uhihihahaaah!! `
`The best screams always come from a girl who's just said some tired line like that. `
`...Fall! `
`Beatriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiceeee...!!!" `
`The goats carrying Beato no longer viewed her as their master. `
`After holding her above the pot of clambering goats, `
`which were snorting heavily in anticipation... `
`...They threw Beato's slender body into the air. `
`All at once, the squirming goats faced the heavens and raised their arms. `
`It was almost as though they would be able to forget their pain `
`for just a short while by devouring her flesh. `
`As she flew through the air, Beato tried to smile boldly, `
`...but it was so stiff that it seemed even more pathetic, `
`much to Bernkastel's amusement. `
`When Beato fell into the pot, the goats caught her. `
`Of course, they didn't do it gently. `
`The arms of countless goats pulled at her flesh to keep it for themselves. `
`They tried to tear her to bits. `
`It didn't have to be flesh. `
`Hair, fingernails, shoes, even bits of her dress worked just fine. `
`The mouths of those goats were the gateway into hell. `
`However, Beato was too big to enter into that gateway. `
`So they had to chew and tear her `
`into bits small enough to fit into it...! `
`......Beato let out a bold laugh. `
`She laughed from inside the pot of goats. `
`However, her expression was very different from the one she had wanted. `
`......It was an expression not of a witch, ...but of a single Human yelling in her death throes. `
`Then, the sea of goats parted. `
`Dlanor leapt forward, slicing all the goats in her path with a single flash of her longsword. `
`...It was a clean slice, like cutting through butter. `
`The goats were surprised by Dlanor's sudden appearance and stepped back. `
`In the center, Beatrice cowered in tatters, `
`...sobbing... `
`"What's this supposed to be, `
`Dlanor, Inquisitor of Heresy?" `
`"My apologies, but I have something to {f:5:say}. `
`There is someone who has an objection to this {f:5:ruling}. `
`His name is... `
`Ushiromiya Battler." `
`All of the goats stared at Battler. `
`"What is unsatisfactory about the court's {f:5:ruling}...? `
`...Do you possess any new evidence or truth sufficient to request a {f:5:retrial}...?" `
`"...............Gah..." `
`I get it. `
`...Dlanor is offering me a helping hand. `
`If she hadn't jumped in here, it'd all be over. `
`And now, I fully understand how I'm supposed to fight. `
`But because I understand how, ...I am unable to fight right now. `
`After all, I can't win by simply countering Erika's truth. `
`If I want to deny her truth, I'll need to present a different one. `
`...And I still don't have a clue what that truth is...! `
`"There is nothing that is not healed with {f:5:time}. `
`And there is no truth that cannot be reached if you spend enough time {f:5:searching}. `
`...However, all trials have a limited time in which the truth must be {f:5:decided}. `
`Therefore, a truth that cannot be reached within that limited time cannot become {f:5:truth}." `
`...Yeah, ...I know that...!! `
`By now, everyone is certain that Aunt Natsuhi's the culprit. `
`It might be too late now, ...even for the real truth...! `
`Aunt Eva's violence will probably go unstopped, `
`and no one is even thinking about protecting Aunt Natsuhi. `
`It's no longer a situation where we can say "oh, the truth will eventually be found". `
`And in this world, ...the time remaining to expose the truth...is very short. `
`It's already 24:00, at the game's end. `
`The police won't come. `
`The truth won't be revealed! `
`Only the truth decided upon here and now will remain...! `
`"..............." `
`I slowly stood up, `
`...walked in front of Beato, `
`...and faced Dlanor. `
`......I have no plan. `
`I don't know the truth. `
`...However, ...if I don't jump in now, I won't get another chance to fight... `
`The red used by Erika's group is mercilessly strict. `
`I seriously doubt that I can put together a truth where Aunt Natsuhi isn't the culprit without violating that red... `
`"...Why the uncertain {f:5:face}? `
`How {f:5:pathetic}." `
`"D-Dammit......" `
`"...B-Battler..." `
`"I'll be the one to kill you. `
`...I want to keep that promise. `
`...And yet, `
`...right now, `
`...I don't have any plan at all..." `
`"......That's okay... `
`In this world, `
`...there is no truth. `
`...The truth is made later on and overwrites what comes before it. `
`Real truth... `
`...doesn't exist anywhere..." `
`"Now this is a splendid scenario, Dlanor. `
`It just wouldn't be interesting unless a knight appears before the princess's execution. `
`...And there's nothing better than watching heads roll before your very eyes! `
`Erase the old piece and the unneeded player all in one go!!" `
`"As you {f:5:wish}. `
`Glory be to the Great Lady Bernkastel! `
`I am the Head Inquisitor of Heresy, Dlanor A. Knox...!! `
`Step forward, Ushiromiya Battler!!" `
`"...D-Dammit, I've got nothing more to lose... `
`If you wanna see me struggle, I'll show yooooooooouuuuu!!" `
`The only reason Erika's theory is so strong is because of those seals. `
`She was given red so quickly just because Lambdadelta easily bought the alibis created by those seals. `
`But the seals aren't red truth! `
`Just sticking paper in a door crack is far from perfect. `
`There's no way something like that can prove anything with "certainty"...! `
`"Begin, Battler!! `
`Ready to let those goats turn you into a pile of meat along with your beloved Beatrice?!" `
`"Oh, and I'll mix the leftovers from your precious sister into that pile. `
`Wouldn't that make for a wonderful stack of meat? `
`...Then we can wrap it up in a dumpling, steam it, and maybe add some soy sauce!!" `
`"No, the best way would be to fry them in a pan with some eggs and ketchup!!" `
`""Ahyahhahahahahahahhhayhhyahyayhyahahahaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!"" `
`"D-Dammiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittt!! `
`"{p:2:Can't we doubt the reliability of these seals of Erika's?! `
`Something like wedging some paper in a door can't create a perfect alibi! `
`It might be that someone noticed by chance and happened to put it back in the same place}...!!" `
`The blade of my blue truth should have slashed diagonally through Dlanor's chest. `
`...However, Dlanor's expression didn't budge in the slightest, and there wasn't a single wound on her chest. `
`"I was wondering what you'd throw out there, but this is ridiculous..." `
`"...Allow me to explain. `
`This is what I sealed the doors with. `
`...Did you think this was paper, Battler-san?" `
`Erika once again held up the thing that looked like brown paper. `
`"This is packing tape. `
`And its adhesive power is extremely strong. `
`...I used scissors to make it easier to tear." `
`"Furthermore, I wrote my signature, which cannot be reproduced, in three places: `
`across the tear point, across the edge between the door and the tape, and across the edge between the tape and the doorframe. `
`Therefore, it's impossible to tear it off without leaving a mark, and it's impossible to reattach too...!" `
`"Permission to unsheathe the "Red Key"." `
`"Granted." `
`"{p:1:Due to the above, the seals are guaranteed to be {f:5:perfect}. `
`Miss Erika's seals were not broken by anyone, and deception is {f:5:impossible}}!!" `
`"{p:2:I'll acknowledge Erika's seals...! `
`However, Auntie Eva's seal on Genji‐san's room should be different}!!" `
`"{p:1:Eva's seal was of the same type as Miss Erika's. `
`That is because this method of sealing was one that Miss Erika and Eva conceived of together after {f:5:dinner}}." `
`"{p:2:Erika fished through the chemicals in Grandfather's room saying she'd use them for forensic testing, right?! `
`There might have been some kind of solvent among them!! `
`If you used that, you might be able to tear off the duct tape without leaving fingernail marks}!!" `
`"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following. `
`{p:1:It is impossible to tear off any of the seals by any method without leaving marks}." `
`"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following. `
`{p:1:There were no suspicious marks on any of the seals}...!" `
`"Therefore, it's been proven that nothing was done to any of the seals. `
`Repeat it!!" `
`"Yes, gladly. `
`{p:1:All of Erika and Eva's seals... `
`were not tampered with in any way that hindered their ability to act as seals, such as being scraped off}." `
`"...Dammiiiiiiit, `
`...damn you, using packing tape that leaves marks all over the place...!" `
`Dlanor isn't my only enemy. `
`There's also her subordinates, Gertrude and Cornelia. `
`And also Erika and her master Bernkastel. `
`And even Lambdadelta, the one who hijacked Beato's game! `
`Everyone in this cathedral is an enemy. `
`That fierce rush of red immediately repelled my feeble truth. `
`...It's obvious why. I don't have any alternate truth. `
`Even at this final stage, ...I have nothing... `
`"Were the seals all that you had to {f:5:discuss}? `
`You promised to give it everything you've {f:5:got}." `
`".........Nngg......" `
`If I only knew a truth that could prove Aunt Natsuhi's innocence... `
`If I could only make a theory that weaves its way through Erika's red... `
`...Dammit, I don't know anything!! `
`"...Do you have any chance of winning...?" `
`"...I left it at home. `
`Mind if I go back and get it?" `
`"I have already lost. `
`...I am prepared for my fate." `
`"...I promised that I'd kill you. `
`So I won't let anyone else do it. `
`I'll definitely keep that promise...!!" `
`"Liar. `
`...I'll never trust your promises again." `
`"Huh? `
`When did I ever make a promise to you, and what was the lie...?" `
`".........Heheheh, ...*cackle*cackle*cackle* `
`...After hearing you say that, hell might not be so bad. `
`......Ehahahahahahaha, gahahahahahaha...!! `
`Kill us! Bernkastel, Lambdadelta...!! `
`Hyahhahahahahahahahahahaahahahaha!!" `
`Beato let out a shrill cry, overcome with laughter. `
`...It was a broken laugh, and tears streamed down her cheeks. `
`Battler's words would no longer reach her ears. `
`She kept on laughing insanely, like a broken record... `
`"Is it {f:5:over}? `
`{f:5:Pitiful}. `
`I truly am {f:5:disappointed}, Ushiromiya Battler...!!" `
`"Hyahhahahahahahahahaha, hiihhahahahahahahaahahahahhyahahahahahaaaaaahh!! `
`Kill me, Dlanor!! Slice me in half with that red longsword of yours!! `
`Hyahhahahahahahahahahaahhaaaaaaahhh!!" `
`Nng, ...nngaaaaaaaaaaaaggghhhhh!! `
`"{p:2:I postulate a method X that could lead someone to the upper floor of the guesthouse without passing through the lounge! `

`In the face of these insane arguments, `
`...any attempts to overturn the truth where Aunt Natsuhi is treated as the culprit are completely meaningless. `
`Each time I brandished my desperate blue truths, `
`Dlanor and the others' red truths knocked me down to the floor. `
`...It was getting hard to even stand back up again. `
`...Does that mean...my body is telling me that I'm about to surrender... `
`to the truth where Aunt Natsuhi is the culprit...? `
`Their red truth is getting more and more perfect... `
`Each time I think I can slip through a chink in their armor, `
`Dlanor smacks me down with the red longsword of Knox... `
`"...Hihihiha, `
`hiihii, `
`...haha, hahahahahaha..." `
`"......Beato..." `
`"That's enough, Battleer... `
`...Now, the endless torture that torments me...no, us... `
`will finally end. `
`...Let us fall together into the depths..." `
`"............Gah..." `
`I don't... `
`want to see Beato like this... `
`Her majesty as the ruler of the Golden Land... `
`...her enthusiasm as my rival... `
`...are completely gone. `
`She's just a pitiful woman who's been trampled over and lost all hope, `
`with tears streaming down her face and a tragic smile that I can't bear to look at... `
`"Does your truth no longer {f:5:exist}?" `
`No, `
`...I have one... `
`last thing. `
`"...And that is a different truth, where Natsuhi isn't the {f:5:culprit}?" `
`...That's not it. `
`All I can do is prove that Aunt Natsuhi isn't the culprit. `
`After that, `
`...I can't show what the real truth `
`is at all... `
`"...But even so, ...maybe at least you'll be saved that way." `
`"Why......?" `
`"...I can show without a doubt that Aunt Natsuhi isn't the culprit. `
`...However, I cannot show a different truth. `
`...If Erika's truth is dispersed, the crime will return to darkness, and there might still be room for you to exist." `
`"Yeah, if you can do it. `
`......But if you can't show a new truth, that means you're incompetent and useless as a player. `
`I'll have you vanish from this game board for all eternity." `
`At this point, the Game Master is Lambdadelta, `
`...and "she" is there too. `
`This probably doesn't mean losing a single game, `
`but being banished from this game for all eternity for losing. `
`From what the witches have said in the past, `
`I can faintly imagine the place "pieces" are sent when they're banished. `
`It's known as the depths of oblivion, `
`...an eternal darkness that lies on the far side of an eternal oblivion and where there is no concept of life or death... `
`...I'm going to disappear, aren't I... `
`However, ...Beato will remain. `
`As long as Beato remains, no matter how suspicious Aunt Natsuhi is, `
`...there will always remain space for the witch to be the culprit...in other words, room for Aunt Natsuhi to not be the culprit. `
`...As long as that space exists, ...someone will eventually expose the truth. `
`It doesn't have to be me. `
`Anyway, ...eventually, someone will smash this fake truth to pieces...! `
`I understood that `
`the time had come to abandon myself for the sake of this other person who would eventually appear, `
`...for the sake of the real truth... `
`"...Well, `
`...it looks like I'll have to break my promise to kill you after all." `
`"Don't. `
`Don't leave me as the only one alive. `
`I'll disappear with you. `
`Let that be your final tribute to me. `
`...I beg you, if you just do this one thing, I don't need anything else..." `
`"......Have you used up everything you {f:5:have}? `
`...I really am disappointed in you, Ushiromiya Battler." `
`"Quickly, perform his requiem. `
`That way, I'll have an open field in which to expose Natsuhi-san's sin." `
`"These guys really are interesting. `
`Beatrice. `

`"...But I've gotten tired of this. `
`You aren't needed in "our game". `

`"If you can, why not go ahead?" `
`{a:c: `
`Take thiiiiiiiiiiis}!!! `
`"{p:1:Ushiromiya Natsuhi is not the culprit}!!!" `
`The red truth is simply truth, with no evidence or proof needed......!! `

`Even if that's all it does, `
`...it's the first and last strike I can make...!! `
`"{p:1:Knox's 2nd: `

`.........Huh...? `
`My... `
`...red truth... `
`...was blown away by Dlanor's red longsword... `
`"...In this court, if anyone other than witches is going to speak the red truth, `
`they'll have to construct an appropriate proof for it. `
`Erika has been following this procedure, right...?" `
`True, Erika hadn't used the red herself even once so far. `
`...She always had Bernkastel, a witch, repeat her statements... `
`"Your red truth isn't something you obtained for yourself. `
`...It's a supernatural truth given by a paranormal being. `
`In other words, it isn't reasoning. `
`It's no better than a random thought..." `
`I- `
`In that case, `
`...if I have Virgilia... `
`...say the same red truth... `
`Where is...Virgilia......? `
`"If you are to present that red truth, you must construct an appropriate {f:5:argument}. `
`.........Can you do {f:5:that}...?" `
`No, ......it's impossible...... `
`I just have the truth that Aunt Natsuhi isn't the culprit, `
`......without any basis or evidence. `
`"......See...? `
`...Real truth...is a very fragile thing. `
`...Does real truth exist...? `
`And is it necessary...? `
`...Even without it, ...the tale will continue on, `

`"Come on, Battler. `

`"......Then, `
`...goodbye. `

`With that, the trial for the 5th game ended. `
`The detective, Furudo Erika, accused the culprit, Ushiromiya Natsuhi. `
`There are three riddles that the detective must explain. `
`The first is the "who dunnit". `
`Who is the culprit? `
`As previously stated, it is Ushiromiya Natsuhi. `
`The second is the "how dunnit". `
`How did they carry out the crime? `
`During the hour between 24:00 on October 4th, 1986 and 1:00 the next day, `
`Ushiromiya Natsuhi went to the cousins' room on the second floor of the guesthouse and the servant waiting room on the first floor of the mansion. `
`There, she carried out the murders. `
`It is only possible for the crime to have taken place during that hour, `
`and for that one hour, alibis have been proven for all characters except Natsuhi. `
`From the sky, a massive, red longsword, even greater in size than the one Dlanor held, came crashing down like a thunderbolt, `
`piercing through Battler's heart and pinning him in place while he still stood... `
`In that instant, Beatrice became a golden splash and faded away, `
`...and her former minions disappeared as well. `
`As the heartless witches looked down at the cathedral's center, laughing coldly, `
`...all that remained was Battler, with the red longsword sticking through him, and Dlanor. `
`"Agh......nng, `
`......gghh......" `
`"...Rest in {f:5:peace}, Ushiromiya Battler. `
`What a {f:5:shame}. `
`I thought you were a more capable person than {f:5:this}." `
`".........Guh........." `
`Battler blew bubbles of blood, `
`...closed his eyes slowly, `
`......and died... `
`Dlanor stared on in silence, `
`...then turned on her heels when she saw his life leave him. `
`After that, all that remained was the corpse of this sorrowful man, pierced by the sword that acted as a massive, red grave marker, `
`and lit by the faint glow let in from the cathedral's skylight...... `
`And then, there is the third riddle the detective must uncover. `
`The final riddle, ...the "why dunnit". `
`Why did they commit the crime? `
`The motive. `
`In third-rate mysteries, there's no need to uncover this. `
`After all, even if you don't expose the motive, the culprit will just confess it when all's said and done. `
`However, Furudo Erika was first-rate, so she would expose even this. `
`Natsuhi was being confined in the parlor, under everyone's watchful gazes. `
`Then, Erika made use of everyone to diligently and persistently search all places, even Natsuhi's room, `
`for clues about her motive. `
`"Well, now that we have all gathered, `
`just what is it that drove Ushiromiya Natsuhi-san to commit these terrible murders? `
`Through my investigation, I, the detective Furudo Erika, have discovered the general outline that explains this. `
`I would like to announce it now." `
`Everyone remained silent, urging her to continue... `
`Erika tossed some of Natsuhi's possessions that had been "confiscated" onto the table... `
`"First, these are past diaries that were discovered in Natsuhi-san's room. `
`They have barely been used at all in recent years, `
`but they describe in detail the period shortly after she became a part of the Ushiromiya family." `
`"Most of them were locked, but in order to find the full truth behind this crime, `
`I used my authority, which everyone has acknowledged, `
`to destroy the locks on all of them." `
`"...H- `
`How barbaric... `
`...Reading... `
`another person's diary..." `
`"If we're barbaric, what does that make you, murderer?!! `
`A criminal like you has no right to privacy!!" `
`"And this is what I found from these diaries. `
`Natsuhi-san ended up married to Krauss-san due to special circumstances." `
`"...I imagine that all of you here know much more about this than I do. `
`Natsuhi-san and Krauss-san were not married because of love or as a normal arranged marriage. `
`...If anything, it was more like taking a hostage." `
`"...Th-That is not true!!" `
`"This is written on the 24th page of this red diary: `
`......'I am a hostage being imprisoned by the Ushiromiya family under the guise of marriage. `
`However, if everything can be resolved this way...'" `
`"Natsuhi-san, `
`right here, you've already acknowledged that you were a hostage. `
`...Kumasawa-san, you have served Natsuhi-san since the time she first came here, right? `
`Could you tell me about what it was like at the time?" `
`"......Y-Yes, that's correct. `
`...I did catch wind of something similar to what you describe... `
`...I think that by now, `
`...only Doctor Nanjo and I know of the details regarding Madam's marriage..." `
`"Very true... `
`...That was during Kinzo-san's golden era, when he did whatever he pleased... `
`He defeated all of his enemies and expanded his financial power. `
`...Natsuhi-san's family was one of those enemies." `
`As though the time to talk had suddenly come at hand, `
`Kumasawa and Nanjo openly delved into territory that should never have been touched upon again... `
`This was concerning the period during which Kinzo was most feared for his ferocity. `
`It has been said that, though Kinzo had many assets and connections, `
`he held a grudge after being looked down upon by members in the elite as being an upstart. `
`Because of this, apparently, `
`Kinzo wanted to find Krauss a wife from a noble family and use this to raise the Ushiromiya family's status... `
`Then, he overcame Natsuhi's family in a financial struggle...and proposed that a marriage be performed as a method of reconciliation. `
`And the person he picked...was Natsuhi. `
`Natsuhi had been raised to be clean and pure in a family of Shinto priests--making her a true noble lady. `
`By choosing her, not only did Kinzo cause them the worst possible humiliation, `
`he also won what he considered to be a nice trophy. `
`So, that marriage proposal was humiliating to Natsuhi from the very beginning... `
`"Regarding the aforementioned facts, both Kumasawa-san and Doctor Nanjo's claims `
`just now match with the contents of the diaries." `
`"Therefore, since the time Natsuhi-san first took the name Ushiromiya Natsuhi, `
`she has held a strong resentment against the Ushiromiya family. `
`...What do you have to say, Natsuhi-san? `
`Do you acknowledge this?" `
`All of the cold gazes turned to face Natsuhi... `
`"...Y-Yes, it's true that I thought that at first... `
`I thought I was being forced into a marriage without love, ...a hostage under the guise of a bride..." `
`"However, ...my husband...never viewed me as a mere hostage... `
`...He understood what I had gone through and gave me compassion and affection... `
`My husband...was the only person who could understand me...!" `
`"...I see. `
`That makes sense. `
`And there are many scenes in your diaries `
`showing that Krauss-san knew of your difficulties and showed kindness." `
`"However, on page 47 of this diary, `
`you describe these moments as being unpleasant, correct?" `
`"Let me read aloud. `
`'When Krauss tries to show kindness, it only makes me feel more wretched. `
`Sometimes, I think he might even be trying to humiliate me further'. `
`...Therefore, we can tell that Natsuhi-san repaid her husband's kindness with contempt." `
`"...W-Wait...! `
`Yes, I may have thought that at the beginning...! `
`Back when I was still overwhelmed with unease, `
`I couldn't accept his kindness and wrote of my distrust from time to time...! `
`But I eventually realized he was sincere and grew to accept his feelings...!" `
`"Well, nothing like that appears in any of these diaries." `
`"...I-I never even wrote it down, `
`those feelings were so secret...!" `
`"Judging by many diverse bits of evidence and testimony, `
`it's clear that you despised your husband. `
`And there exists no evidence `
`that you eventually accepted his feelings, as you claim." `
`"......I-I loved my husband...!!" `
`"You can't find any testimony or evidence that can be used to elevate that statement to the level of red truth, right?" `
`"...D-Does anyone need evidence to say they're in love...?!" `
`"You can't trust anything besides the red truth...!! `
`Statements that aren't red don't count as evidence at all, and they can't be trusted at all! `
`All non-red letters are falsehoods that exist to deceive me!! `
`"I love you"? `
`Who would believe that when spoken with the white text? `
`No non-red words can ever be trusted!! `
`All I can trust in this world are the red truth and the pieces of evidence I offer to my master to gain it!!" `
`"You lying Human who can't speak the truth!! `
`Humans lacking the red truth have no right to speak of love or the heart or truth! `
`Did you know? `
`Men aren't as stupid as you women think they are. `
`Men never really take it seriously when a woman says "I love you"...!" `
`"...What a pitiful person... `
`I see that you've never truly loved someone..." `
`"Romance is unnecessary for a detective. `
`I don't think I've ever used the word romance except to explain a motive for murder." `
`"No matter what you say, we loved each other...!! `
`I should be apologizing to my husband for always writing down my complaints and nothing else...! `
`But I have devoted my heart to him...!! `
`Even if I can't prove it, ...that is the truth!!" `
`"Rejected. `
`You just don't know when to give up, do you? `
`By now, due to evidence and testimony, `
`it's clear you hated both your husband and the Ushiromiya family." `
`"That's right!! `
`I can't even count the number of times I've heard you complain...!!" `
`"Oh, and you've never talked behind Hideyoshi-san's back...?!" `
`"Dammit, you killed my husband!! `
`How dare you say that?!! `
`Die! Die and apologize to my husband!!" `
`"Please cease your violence, Eva-san. `
`This is now the precious moment where I question and convict the culprit. `
`It's not yours, okay?" `
`"Well then. `
`Over the next several years, she appeared to have gotten used to her new way of life, `
`but in actuality, an intense hatred still lurked in her heart. `
`Taking that into consideration, there would be nothing odd at all about her deciding to take revenge." `
`"D-Don't act like you know what I'm thinking...!!" `
`Each time Erika read Natsuhi's diaries, one after another, `
`...she exposed more of Natsuhi's emotions during those painful days. `
`...Natsuhi hadn't written them to leave those words behind. `
`She had written to forget those memories and seal them away. `
`That's why she had written down her feelings during those painful days, `
`...locked them up, and sealed them away for all eternity. `
`However, Erika claimed that these were Natsuhi's true, hidden feelings `
`that had been locked away and concealed. `
`Since it had already been "concluded" that Natsuhi was a murderer, everyone accepted Erika's claim. `
`By this point, the red truth wasn't even necessary to establish Natsuhi's motive. `
`As long as the reason seemed plausible, everyone would believe it. `
`No matter how much Natsuhi might object, no one would believe her. `
`No one could accept the truth Natsuhi spoke of, about the days she had spent loving her husband. `
`That had been painted over by a false truth, in which she hated her husband and swore revenge against him... `
`The pen of the gods that composes the truth had been given to Erika. `
`"And so what?! `
`Who gives a damn about your past?!! `
`Murderer, murdereeeeeer!!" `
`"S-Stop that...! `
`I can understand how Natsuhi-san felt...!" `
`"I always thought this day would come, eventually... `
`...Poor thing, poor thing..." `
`"I think she's just one of the pitiable victims `
`of Father's wild life." `
`"I knew of the pain in Madam's heart... `
`I always tried to support her, `
`...but I failed, and look what has happened..." `
`"...I don't... `
`even understand... `
`the emotions of love and hate." `
`"......You will, someday. `
`It can become a reason to live... `
`and also a reason to kill." `
`"............" `
`"............... `
`...I- `
`Is Aunt Natsuhi... `
`...really the culprit...?" `
`"Well, now that you mention it, `
`there is just one person besides Natsuhi-san that might be the culprit." `
`"...Wh-What? `
`Hey, are you serious...?! `
`Why didn't you say something that important sooner?!!" `
`"Natsuhi-san, `
`the truth is, there is one person besides you for whom the crime was possible. `
`...If you truly claim that you aren't the culprit, `
`it means that person must be the culprit." `
`".........Huh...?" `
`"Who is it...?! `
`Who...?!" `
`"Ushiromiya...Kinzo-san." `
`"......Ah, ......" `
`"Early this morning, Kinzo-san went outside through the window of the third floor study, `
`and his location is unknown. `
`Isn't that right, Battler-san?" `
`"...Nngg, ......" `
`"Just like Natsuhi-san, `
`Kinzo-san has no alibi whatsoever. `
`The truth is, for this crime, it was possible for Kinzo-san to be the culprit as well." `
`"I just assumed that he never existed in the first place, `
`so I totally forgot about him until just now. `
`Allow me to apologize." `
`She didn't look shy or apologetic in the slightest. `
`Erika bowed in as unpleasant a manner as ever... `
`...She had held a grudge ever since her defeat in the study battle... `
`"Natsuhi-san, you gained Kinzo-san's trust and are the person who served closest to him, right? `
`So, shouldn't you know better than anyone else? `
`...This incident is actually the crime of the Family Head, carried out by Ushiromiya Kinzo-san." `
`"...Y- `
`You dare... `
`...call Father...a criminal...?" `
`"Don't worry. `
`I have prepared more than enough evidence and testimony `
`to explain the "why dunnit" if Kinzo-san was actually the culprit. `
`If you say, for example, that you have put yourself on the line to cover for Kinzo's crime, I am more than capable of supporting you." `
`"Ever since the late period of the author Ellery Queen, `
`even the theory created by the detective can sometimes change the plot itself. `
`You really can't afford to be careless in this day and age." `
`"...I won't let you... `
`...treat Father like the culprit!!" `
`"Natsuhi-san, `
`calm down, place your hand on your chest, and think carefully. `
`...If you accuse Kinzo-san of being the culprit, this entire case will be resolved. `
`You will no longer be held accountable for another person's actions, and your honor will be restored." `
`In other words, by pushing the crime onto Kinzo, Natsuhi would be saved... `
`However...... `
`"...I-I have been entrusted with the honor of the Ushiromiya family...by Father... `
`...Did you really think......that I would defile Father's honor, ...the Ushiromiya family honor, `
`just to clear away the false accusations made against me...?!!" `
`Of course, Natsuhi knew that she wasn't the culprit. `
`And she also knew that Kinzo wasn't. `
`So being framed herself and pushing the blame onto Kinzo were both unacceptable, `
`unbearable outcomes. `
`"Are you sure? `
`As I have already established quite thoroughly, `
`alibis have been proven for everyone except you. `
`If you will not accuse Kinzo-san, `
`...then this time, it really will be clear that you are the culprit, `
`and that will become the truth, right...?" `
`"If you intend to label me as the culprit and call that your own personal truth, `
`then do whatever you like...! `
`I am sure that God knows of my innocence...! `
`Eventually, he will prove it!!" `
`If it came to a choice between her and Kinzo being framed, `
`...Natsuhi would sacrifice herself. `
`Perhaps... `
`...that was her way... `
`...of protecting the Ushiromiya family's honor. `
`"......Aunt...Natsuhi..." `
`"And I even gave you a chance..." `
`.........Stupid woman. `
`This future where your name will eventually be cleared... `
`doesn't exist for any of you...not for any of the pieces on this board. `
`Natsuhi...had made her decision. `
`If they were going to call her the culprit, `
`...she would let them. `
`She boldly rejected the thought of selling Kinzo's honor `
`to gain a momentary truth where she wasn't the culprit... `
`And, therefore... `
`The tale was woven with her as the culprit. `
`In the future, if the accusations against her are proven false. `
`This tale will probably be rewritten... `
`However, that future will never come. `
`...I think... `
`Truth is a fleeting thing. `
`Even if I am a good person until my death... `
`If some heartless person after my death overwrites the records and says I wasn't a good person, `
`and if that is shared with everyone else... `
`...Then even all the goodness in which I lived my life could be overwritten easily. `
`And so, I think... `
`That I won't live as a good person for all eternity.... `
`"...If you claim that Kinzo-san was not the culprit, `
`he will need an alibi proving that the crime was impossible for him. `
`Otherwise, we cannot truly be certain that you are the culprit, Natsuhi-san." `
`Erika has probably known for a long time. `
`Kinzo is nothing more than an illusion to make the inheritance problem more uncertain. `
`However, it would be very hard to prove that he was an illusion. `
`The only way to do this would be to confirm Kinzo's death, `
`...but as has been made known by the red truth in previous games, Kinzo died a long time ago. `
`And in this 5th game, his corpse hasn't even appeared. `
`In a situation like this, it wouldn't be easy to absolutely prove his death... `
`If Kinzo's death was confirmed, ...it would practically erase that defeat in the study. `
`It was the only way Erika had of removing the humiliation of that loss. `
`And there was something that could confirm Kinzo's death almost as certainly as real proof. `
`And that was........."the confession of the culprit". `
`It would mean having Natsuhi herself acknowledge that Kinzo no longer existed in this world. `
`That way, it would be acknowledged that Erika's reasoning in the study was correct, `
`...that loss would be painted over, and it would be rewritten as Erika's victory... `
`Battler hung suspended by Dlanor's red longsword. `
`Beato had disappeared by having her existence denied, ...and her minions had gone too. `
`In this cathedral that they had disappeared from, `
`...only Natsuhi and the witches convicting her remained. `
`"So, `
`...you still claim that Kinzo is alive and remains somewhere on this island...?" `
`"That's correct...! `
`Father is in good health...! `
`No matter what anyone says, I will not change my statement...!" `
`"The red truth from the previous games says that `
`{p:1:Kinzo is already dead}. `
`...But that's not enough to satisfy you, right, Bern?" `
`"...Yeah, that's right. `
`I'm after a perfect victory. `
`...So there's nothing interesting about getting a checkmate just because Kinzo's death has been confirmed by the red. `
`...I want to win by forcing Natsuhi to say she's resigned. `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*!" `
`"Then why don't you try it? `
`Show us what you've got." `
`"My master, let us now achieve a perfect victory...!!" `
`"Of course. `
`.........Natsuhi, `
`you say Kinzo is certainly alive, but you don't know where he is, correct?" `
`"Yes, that's right...! `
`Father left through the window and his location is unknown...! `
`He is so troublesome sometimes...!" `
`"Lambda, `
`I'm gonna make Kinzo's location from 24:00 until the morning absolutely clear. `
`... `
`{p:1:From midnight until morning, Kinzo stayed in the same room}." `
`"......? `
`Well, that's true, ...he was a corpse after all. `
`............ `
`...No, I'm sorry. `
`That's right, totally right. `
`I won't butt in. `
`It sounds interesting, so keep going." `
`"......From now on, I'll use the word Kinzo to refer to "the living Kinzo". `
`After all, Natsuhi claims that he's alive. `
`...I'll say more with the red truth. `
`{p:1:Kinzo does not exist anywhere outside the mansion}. `
`...Isn't that right? Erika." `
`"Y-Yes, my master...!! `
`I searched for Kinzo all over the premises outside the mansion...! `
`However, I was unable to find him...!" `
`Because of the detective's authority, Erika could "find all clues". `
`Therefore, if Erika was unable to find "a hint that Kinzo existed outside the mansion", `
`it was the same as proving that Kinzo didn't exist outside the mansion. `
`Therefore, Bernkastel repeated that truth of Erika's... `
`"{p:1:Kinzo does not exist outside the mansion}. `
`.........Hey, Natsuhi. `
`If "Kinzo does exist", then this means he must be somewhere inside the mansion. `
`Do you have any idea where Kinzo might be hiding...?" `
`"H-How could I know...?! `
`After all, think of the weather. `
`There would be nothing strange about him leaving the courtyard `
`to hide somewhere in the mansion and dry the rain off...!" `
`"Pfft, ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle* `
`From this point forward, I will repeat the same thing several times. `
`...I'll give you many chances for an honorable surrender. `
`...If you're too stubborn, you'll lose even your true honor." `
`"......N-No matter how you threaten me, I will not give in...!!" `
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle* `
`I just love teasing pieces like you. `
`...Then, let us continue." `
`"...For the aforementioned reasons, it is unthinkable that Kinzo-san could have been somewhere outside the mansion. `
`...So, first off, I performed an extensive search of the third floor, where the study is." `
`"However, there was nowhere he could've been hiding. `
`......We couldn't find any trace of Dad on the third floor." `
`"So then, where is he, Natsuhi-san?" `
`"I-I don't know...! `
`If he isn't on the third floor, perhaps he's hiding in the basement..." `
`"Ah, yes, the basement. `
`The boiler room, that underground storage room...every part of your suspicious basement was also included in my search." `
`"Yes, I searched too...! `
`I didn't see Father anywhere...!" `
`"I'll say it again. `
`Where is Kinzo-san, Natsuhi-san?" `
`"I-In that case, he was probably on the first floor or the second floor...!!" `
`"I see, process of elimination does tell us that, doesn't it? `
`We then thoroughly searched the first floor. `
`And the result?" `
`"......Nothing. `
`We were unable to find Father." `
`"I'll say it again. `
`Where was Kinzo-san, Natsuhi-san?" `
`"Th-Then he was probably hiding on the second floor...!! `
`How should I know where Father was hiding?!" `
`"Are you sure about that...? `
`Do you really not know where Kinzo-san was hiding...?" `
`"M `
`......Madam knows... `
`...where Kinzo was hiding...?!" `
`"......That's...insane..." `
`"That...can't be true..." `
`Both Shannon and Kanon knew that Kinzo was already dead. `
`So they didn't have a clue how Erika would use `
`a phantom of a person who didn't exist to corner Natsuhi... `
`"{p:1:Kinzo is nowhere outside the mansion. `
`Kinzo isn't on the third floor. `
`Kinzo isn't in the basement. `
`Kinzo isn't on the first floor. `
`Therefore, the only place Kinzo could possibly exist is the second floor}." `
`"I accept that red truth. `
`...Natsuhi, `
`Kinzo should be somewhere on the second floor. `
`Will you still not tell us where he's hiding...?" `
`"N-No matter how many times you ask, it won't change the fact that I don't know!" `
`"Erika, `
`start from the beginning and go in order, investigating the entire second floor. `
`...Use the detective's authority to avoid missing a single clue and to see through all types of hidden doors and hidden rooms...!" `
`"Yes, my master...!! `
`That Natsuhi-san's pretty dumb, isn't she...? `
`She still can't see where we're going with this." `
`"*giggle* `
`No need to talk more than is necessary. `
`Come on, Erika. `
`Take everyone with you and begin the investigation...!" `
`Erika used her detective's authority to take everyone, even Natsuhi, `
`and go up to the second floor to search every room, starting at one end. `
`Even for rooms that were thought to have nothing at all to do with the crime, Erika did not relax her search in the slightest. `
`...Her search was thorough in every single room as they moved through them all... `
`"So, you still won't tell us where Kinzo-san is hiding?" `
`"Stop saying that! `
`How many times do I have to say that I don't know...?!" `
`"Natsuhi-san, `
`...even if we do keep searching, we'll never be able to find Kinzo-san at this rate, right?" `
`"...?!" `
`Of course. `
`Kinzo doesn't exist. `
`No matter how long this search continues, it's just a waste of time. `
`This was known by Erika, the witch's piece, and Natsuhi, the one who knew the truth... `
`"In that case, this search will end in the room at the far end of that corridor. `
`...In other words, it will have been proven that Kinzo wasn't in any of the rooms except that one. `
`What do you think about that?" `
`"He isn't on the third floor or the first floor or the basement, `
`and he isn't in any of the rooms on the second floor except the one at the end. `
`So if he really did exist inside the mansion, `
`......it had been proven that he could only exist in that room at the end. `
`In other words, this was Hempel's Raven. `
`Because it had been established that a "living Kinzo" couldn't exist anywhere except the final room at the end of the corridor, `
`that automatically meant that a "living Kinzo" existed in that final room... `
`...And that room at the end of the corridor was... `
`"Oh, ......ah........." `
`"Which room was at the end of the corridor, again?" `
`Lambdadelta was munching on a refill of popcorn. `
`"That's Natsuhi's room, Lady Lambdadelta...!!" `
`"...In other words, Kinzo had no place to hide except inside Natsuhi's room. `
`...*giggle*giggle*giggle*! `
`Do I need to say it in red?" `
`"Of course...!" `
`"{p:1:Kinzo does not exist anywhere outside Natsuhi's room}!" `
`"Well then, `
`that means this room is the only place left. `
`...It means Kinzo-san isn't anywhere outside this room." `
`"...I-Isn't this my room?!! `
`Where exactly in my room do you claim Father is hiding...?!" `
`In a rage, Natsuhi unlocked the door to her room and pointed inside. `
`...Of course, Kinzo was nowhere to be seen. `
`"Do you see Father anywhere in here?! `
`Look!!" `
`"......I see, looks like he isn't there. `
`Did he realize we were coming and escape out the window?" `
`If Kinzo wasn't in this last room, ...it meant that he didn't exist anywhere. `
`"There was no living Kinzo outside the mansion". `
`"There was no living Kinzo inside the mansion". `
`Therefore..."No living Kinzo existed". `
`However, Erika didn't make that argument. `
`She had pointed that out herself, without making a checkmate. `
`It was because Bernkastel didn't want to win by cornering Natsuhi with the red truth. `
`She wanted to force Natsuhi to accept a humiliating resignation... `
`"I have not only been searching for Kinzo-san himself all this time. `
`I have been looking for signs that Kinzo-san hid somewhere between 24:00 and the morning. `
`And no such signs have existed." `
`"...In other words, from 24:00 until morning, `
`Kinzo was always holed up in the same room. `
`And that was Natsuhi's room!" `
`"It means the checkmate of red truth `
`has finally cornered the piece known as Kinzo's phantom inside Natsuhi's room." `
`"Hey, Natsuhi-san. `
`This means you were with Kinzo in this room until morning. `
`Do you still claim that you didn't know where he was?" `
`"I'll acknowledge it with the red truth...!! `
`{p:1:For the entire duration of the night between midnight and morning, `
`a living Kinzo could not have existed anywhere outside Natsuhi's room}!! `
`I permit you to use this truth to advance your argument about how he could only have existed in Natsuhi's room!" `
`"A plea bargain. `
`......Hey, Natsuhi. `
`...Even someone as stupid as you must have realized the fix you're in now. `
`This is your last chance. `
`......Make Kinzo the culprit." `
`"Call the Ushiromiya Family Head a criminal and crush the Head's honor to protect yourself. `
`If you show that you have the guts to do that, `
`I'll change the plot into one of a tragic heroine taking the blame to protect the Family Head." `
`"Father is innocent! `
`I cannot call Father a criminal!!" `
`"...She's refused the deal! `
`Hehehehehehehe, okay, Bern. `
`Do it...!" `
`"{p:1:For the entire duration of the night between midnight and morning, `
`a living Kinzo could not have existed in any place except inside your bed}." `
`"......Wha, `
`...and... `
`...wh- `
`what do you mean...by that......?" `
`"After conducting a thorough search of this room, `
`and a detailed scientific examination, `
`I discovered that Kinzo did not exist anywhere in this room between 24:00 and morning. `
`However, your bed is the only exception." `
`A shocked silence dominated the room... `
`Natsuhi completely forgot to close her open mouth... `
`"Last night, `
`around the time the gold was discovered, so probably at about 23:00, `
`Kinzo-san escaped from the window on the third floor and snuck into the bed in your room. `
`...And, as an even more unfortunate result from my investigation, `
`it has been proven that you were also sleeping in that bed." `
`"I'll repeat it. `
`{p:1:For the entire duration of the night between midnight and morning, `
`a living Kinzo could not have existed in any place except inside Natsuhi's bed. `
`And last night, Natsuhi also slept in that same bed}." `
`"Wow, look how close they were. `
`So, you two were so close to each other, you slept sharing the same pillow?" `
`"Blue truth. `
`{p:2:Therefore, we can conjecture that Ushiromiya Natsuhi and Ushiromiya Kinzo had sexual relations with each other. `
`Why else would a man and a woman share the same bed all night long}?" `
`"H-How rude!!! `
`T-T-To think that I would... `
`...d-do such a thing...with the Father I respected so much... `
`I-I won't allow you to say such things!!" `
`"Natsuhi, `
`use the red truth to counter this blue truth. `
`Of course, since you aren't a witch, there's no red that you can use. `
`So I'll speak with the red truth in your place. `
`At least, I will if you can show me convincing proof...!!" `
`"...H- `
`How could such proof... `
`even exist?!! `
`How low are you willing to sink to mock me?! `
`D-Dammiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!" `
`Natsuhi tried to attack Erika, `
`...but Eva pinned her arms behind her back, so she couldn't do anything. `
`"How unsightly. `
`...In order to take revenge against the Ushiromiya family, `
`you first schemed to take control of everything the family owned. `
`For that reason, you used your body as a weapon and ensnared Kinzo-san." `
`"I never did anything of the sort!! `
`I have never given my body to anyone except my husband!!" `
`"I understand why you want to deny it, `
`......but testimony from several witnesses has already made it clear that you've had repeated secret meetings with Kinzo-san." `
`"After all, last night, you went to "say goodnight" to Kinzo-san... `
`with just the two of you alone in his study, right? `
`And beyond that, I've collected multiple bits of testimony regarding clear traces of sexual intercourse." `
`"Are you insane?!?! `
`Who was it?! `
`Who said something so ridiculous?! `
`G-Gohda?! `
`Shannon?! `
`Was it Eva-san?! `
`Yes, you must be behind something this ludicrous!! `
`Who was it?! Whooooo?! `
`Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!" `
`"I've received testimony from those involved. `
`Wow, this is pretty fatal. `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*...! No room for doubt now!" `
`"Hey, Natsuhi, `
`looks like you don't even have a scrap of honor left now, `
`...but I'll give you one, final chance before I build you the worst of all possible Fragments. `
`......Go ahead and say that Kinzo wasn't there, okay?" `
`"That's right, you sure are stubborn, Natsuhi. `
`...The Ushiromiya family has already been torn to ribbons, right? `
`...Are you really that desperate to confuse the inheritance problem by pretending Kinzo exists?" `
`"This is my final challenge...in protecting the honor of the Ushiromiya family, which Father entrusted me with...!! `
`My husband's business will definitely...definitely succeed!! `
`Until we can use that to repay our debts, I cannot hand over the inheritance of the Ushiromiya family!!" `
`"I will protect Father and my husband's honor!! `
`That is...my mission!!!" `
`"...Wanting to protect the honor of the dead is an admirable trait." `
`"He's not one of the dead. `
`We're talking about the honor of a convenient delusion inside Natsuhi's head. `
`...... `
`{p:1:The real Kinzo never once ordered Natsuhi... `
`to do anything like protect his honor}." `
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!" `
`As Natsuhi screamed, she fell down to her hands and knees... `
`She no longer `
`had any way to reject the fake truth `
`that Bernkastel and Erika had weaved... `
`"......By my name as the Game Master, Lambdadelta, `
`...I acknowledge Lady Bernkastel as the victor of this game! `
`...If anyone has any objections, state your name now!!" `
`............... `
`Of course there were none. `
`All of those who might have objected had been erased... `
`"No objections! `
`Bern, this is your victory, and a wonderful victory it is! `
`Now, you must weave up the Fragment of the truth!!" `
`"Sure. `
`I'll go weave up the truth. `
`...This is the truth of this sad, pathetic tale. `
`...Though I did want Natsuhi to acknowledge her crime while half-laughing, half-crying. `
`After all, that's standard in the genre, right? `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!" `
