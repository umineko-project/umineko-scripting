`*knock*knock*knock*knock*!!! `
`The sudden sound of someone banging fiercely on the door brought Natsuhi to her senses. `
`She had probably nodded off in the study while planning how they would overcome the next day. `
`But...what could it be...? `
`At a time like this... `
`More importantly, the knock itself was strange. `
`If someone wanted to contact her, they could've just used the internal phone line. `
`She'd told them that she'd be here. `
`Realizing that something strange was going on, `
`Natsuhi shook her head one more time, completely throwing off her drowsiness. `
`"Father, Father...!! `
`It's Eva. `
`I have an urgent, vital matter to discuss with you!" `
`It was Eva's voice. `
`...What is this? `
`I thought I told them to lock the doors and windows of the mansion tightly after everyone left for the guesthouse. `
`So why is Eva here...?! `
`Natsuhi ran up to the door, responded with a small knock, and spoke through the door in a quiet voice. `
`"......What is it? You're too noisy!" `
`"Natsuhi nee-san...?! `
`Why are you in Father's study at this hour?!" `
`"...I told you to be quiet! `
`Have you forgotten that the Head values peace and silence more than anything else...?!" `
`"Now's not the time to be saying that!! `
`Stop harping on that, and open up quickly!! `
`Bring Father out!!" `
`"The Head just went to sleep! `
`I don't know what business you have, but I will deal with it tomorrow!" `
`"I don't have any business with you!! `
`Just open up right now!!" `
`Sometimes, multiple schemes and assumptions can fall apart due to the most direct, simple, and emotional of strategies. `
`This is bad... `
`If I open the door, Eva will probably throw herself forwards and rush into the study. `
`Now, I can't even open this door...! `
`At that moment, the phone suddenly rang. `
`I-It's okay. `
`Both of the keys to the study are here. `
`No one can open this door...! `
`Natsuhi inched away from the door and grabbed the receiver... `
`"H-Hello!! `
`It's Natsuhi!" `
`"It's me... `
`Things are bad. `
`I want you to come down to the parlor, quickly." `
`It was from Krauss. `
`His tone was strained. `
`...What in the world happened...?! `
`"It would seem that Battler-kun and this guest called Erika... `
`...solved the witch's epitaph and found the gold." `
`"Huh? ............ `
`...I-Is that true?!" `
`"Rudolf and the rest have forced their way in. `
`They're saying Battler-kun will show everyone the way to the hidden gold..." `
`"Right now, Eva-san is just outside the study door, yelling at me to open it...! `
`But if I do that now, she might push her way inside...!!" `
`"...I-I understand. `
`I will go there too. `
`Don't worry about Eva. `
`Just stay there and don't do anything...! `
`I'll give you a signal once I've gotten Eva away from the door, so leave as soon as you hear that. `
`Ready...?!" `
`Right after that, Krauss came up the staircase, accompanied by Genji. `
`A heated debate started between him and Eva. "Open up!" "No, calm down." `
`In the middle of that, there was a small knock as a signal. `
`...Krauss had cleverly pushed Eva away from the door and distracted her. `
`During that gap, Natsuhi slipped out of the study and quickly shut the door... `
`Eva noticed this, and her face twisted in disappointment, `
`but the heavy sound of the auto-lock had already rung out, and the door had been sealed. `
`"The gold of the epitaph has been found! `
`It's only natural that we should inform Father about this...!! `
`Or else what? `
`Is there some reason you can't tell Father about this?!" `
`"Father gave strict orders that he not be awakened—no matter what—after he went to bed. `
`Following those orders is the duty of the Head's representative. `
`Isn't that right, Genji-san?" `
`"......Yes. `
`The Master's sleep must not be disturbed, no matter what happens." `
`"Even a rule like that depends on time and circumstances, doesn't it...?!! `
`I mean, the epitaph was solved!! `
`Father has a right to know straight away!" `
`"Of course, the two of us will report on everything to the Head tomorrow. `
`That's our duty as the Head's representatives." `
`"I don't care about that!! `
`Come on, just open this door!! `
`Let me see Father!! `
`Father, Father, can you hear me? `
`It's Eva!! `
`Please open up!!" `
`"Owowow, let go of me...!! `
`Th-That hurts...!!" `
`"We're telling you to listen to us...! `
`Don't knock on the door so loudly...!!" `
`"Ouch, owowowowow...!! `
`Let go, let go of me!!" `
`"Krauss-sama, Eva-sama, `
`the Master is sleeping. `
`Please refrain from disturbing him any further...!" `
`When Genji spoke firmly, the two finally ceased their scuffle. `
`It seemed that Genji, the one who had spoken for Kinzo since they were very young, still possessed an air of dignity strong enough to handle both Krauss and Eva... `
`Eva put her argument aside for the time being. `
`She could hold off worrying about that until after she saw the gold with her own eyes. `
`After all, not even Eva had seen it for herself yet. `
`Natsuhi and the others had managed to somehow deal with the momentary crisis. `
`...However, the move of the demons that would sneer upon their efforts...had already begun... `
`"Battler......solved the riddle of the epitaph, you say...?!" `
`"Yes. `
`...Though he had a lot of help from that Erika girl, Battler was the one who reached the answer. `
`Erika has proclaimed that she will abandon her rights to the Golden Land. `
`...Therefore, the one who reached the Golden Land...is Battler." `
`"......Fate can be truly amusing. `
`To think that Battler-sama...would make it there." `
`"What will you do, Beato? `
`...You promised to stop the ceremony if anyone solved the epitaph's riddle." `
`"Yes. `
`...That was the deal." `
`"............That was the deal. `
`Indeed..." `
`"Apparently, Battler-sama does not intend to become the master of the Golden Land. `
`...It now seems that no one will become our master." `
`"That is also fate. `
`It has been several decades since we first manifested in the Human world through our bond with Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}. `
`...The time since then has been so very fun." `
`"......Come on, Lia, you sound like an old lady. `
`...So, what're we going to do? `
`If we go by Riiche and {f:5:Goldsmith}'s rules, now that Battler's solved the epitaph and decided not to become our master, `
`we've been relieved from duty, right?" `
`"That's true. `
`...I have no regrets at all. `
`I've been prepared to be kicked down into Cocytus all this time." `
`"Wait. `
`We can't let that happen. `
`...You might not have any regrets, but I will keep on serving Natsuhi. `
`It would be quite irresponsible to let ourselves be relieved from duty just because Battler solved the epitaph. `
`...Witches are forbidden from breaking contracts, but they also must not fail to show gratitude." `
`"...True. `
`We should serve her until the family conference ends." `
`"In that case, you won't be relieved from duty for a while either, Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}. `
`...Perhaps you should wait until you've overcome this family conference safely, said goodbye to Natsuhi-sama at the very least, `
`...and if possible, rewarded her for all her efforts." `
`".........Indeed. `
`...She has done well supporting my foolish son." `
`"You're a fallen angel with one of its wings plucked off, aren't you? `
`Just leave the other wing as a parting gift and go." `
`"...Indeed. `
`...Perhaps that would be fitting. `
`Natsuhi may be worthy of bearing my wing. `
`...However, ......we are approaching the critical moment. `
`...Your reward is waiting for you. `
`Try to make it through this test unscathed, ...Natsuhi..." `
`The mountain of gold left everyone speechless. `
`Regardless of how strongly they had believed in its existence, `
`...no one could look at this much real gold and not be shocked... `
`"......To think a place like this existed......" `
`"I can't believe it... `
`...That Dad......" `
`Everyone was stunned by the gold. `
`The first one to break the silence and jump around in ecstasy was Hideyoshi. `
`Letting out an excited laugh, he clung to the wall of gold. `
`Then he felt the cold, hard touch of it all over his cheek. `
`"W-Wahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!! `
`Th-This is incredible! `
`It's the real thing!!" `
`"......H-Hahahahahahaha!! `
`That damn Dad of ours, sticking this much gold in such a ridiculous place!!" `
`"Now that we have this much, `
`...we no longer... `
`have anything to fear... `
`With this, `
`...we could overcome any kind of trial...! `
`Rosaaa...!!" `
`"Nee-san, ...Nee-san... `
`We'll be able to find happiness with this, right...?" `
`Eva and Rosa moved towards each other at the same time and hugged as they broke down crying... `
`Ecstasy and shock, ...wonder and sighs. `
`After stepping forward in front of the pile of gold that had caused these mixed emotions, `
`...Erika spoke as though she were an announcer in some show. `
`"......If this world is money, then this gold is the embodiment of happiness. `
`...Congratulations, everyone. `
`I pray that this discovery makes all of your lives richer." `
`"I take my hat off to you... `
`...To think you'd solve the epitaph within a single day of coming to this island." `
`"......If you couldn't solve it in a single day, then you wouldn't be able to solve it no matter how many days you had. `
`After all, it doesn't take more than an instant for your little gray cells to give you a flash of intuition. `
`...Also, I wouldn't have been able to solve this riddle myself. `
`I ask that you praise Battler-san's achievement as well, everyone." `
`"..............." `
`"...I abandon any rights to this discovery. `
`I'm already satisfied to have my reasoning proven correct. `
`So, I'd like give Battler-san full credit." `
`"...I may be here, but please continue your discussion as though I wasn't. `
`Battler-san called all of the adults here, making sure that none of the cousins would notice. `
`That can only mean one thing. `
`...He must have wanted to begin the true family conference with all of you." `
`"...Erika, `
`quit deciding things on your own." `
`"My apologies. `
`.........In that case, I'll step down as the facilitator of these proceedings. `
`So, who will take my place?" `
`Shrugging, Erika looked around at everyone. `
`...After a short period of silence, Eva made the first move. `
`"None of us have forgotten the deal we made earlier today, right?" `
`"Yeah. `
`Divide it between the four of us, with 2.5 billion for each. `
`And then, {i:the Successor} gets another 10 billion." `
`"......W-Wait a second! `
`Who decided that the one who discovers the gold becomes the Successor?!" `
`"Hold up, you won't be able to get away with that, Natsuhi-san...!! `
`We've all been arguing based on that premise this whole time, haven't we?! `
`You really think you can pretend that never happened now?!" `
`"...That's right. `
`...Weren't you the one worrying about how, if one of the servants solved the riddle, they might consider themselves the Successor...?" `
`"But nowhere is it explicitly written that that's the truth, right?!" `
`"You bastard!!! `
`We were all aware of it, weren't we?!!" `
`"That's right, Aniki! `
`Are you gonna change your position this late in the game?!" `
`"Though it was never stipulated, I believe it was common knowledge between us. `
`I don't see how you can suggest we ignore it completely." `
`"You can't just interpret the Head's epitaph however you like!! `
`Where is it written that the one who finds the gold becomes the Successor?! `
`The epitaph was decided upon by the Head. `
`You have no right to decide these things for yourselves!!" `
`"......Calm down, Natsuhi." `
`"How could I calm down?! `
`Yes, I do find it quite impressive that Battler-kun solved the epitaph! `
`I certainly believe he should be rewarded for it. `
`However, it's clearly a stretch to suggest that he deserves half of everything, `
`and you won't get away with the argument that the discoverer becomes the Successor...!!" `
`"Th-That's low, Natsuhi nee-san...! `
`This is completely different from what you were saying earlier today...!" `
`"I agree! `
`Though it was never stipulated, the fact that whoever solves the epitaph becomes the Successor has always been the greatest unwritten rule we've had...! `
`It's not fair if you start complaining about that at the last second, right? `
`Yeah, it isn't fair!!" `
`"Anyway!! `
`This gold is Father's!! `
`We can't decide how it will be split up without Father's permission!!" `
`"No way!! `
`That's low, Natsuhi-san! `
`We were talkin' about this on and on earlier, right?! `
`Are you sayin' that whole conversation today was a bunch of bull?! `
`It just ain't right!!" `
`"Why don't we just vote on it?!! `
`Battler-kun, the one who found the gold, is the Successor! `
`My husband and I have no objections!! `
`What about you, Rudolf and Kyrie-san? `
`Rosa?!" `
`"No objections here. Nice going, Battler!!" `
`"I have no objections either. `
`Battler-kun is the true Successor, chosen by the epitaph. `
`If you aren't satisfied, then why don't we just ask Father directly...?!" `
`"That's right. `
`Like you just said, Natsuhi nee-san, Father is the one who wrote the riddle of the epitaph. `
`And he's also the proper owner of this gold. `
`In that case, shouldn't we talk to Father about this directly? `
`How should Battler-kun, the person who discovered the gold, be treated? `
`I believe Father is the only one capable of making such a decision...!" `
`"B-But...!!" `
`"...Didn't I tell you to calm down? ........." `
`"Rosa and Kyrie-san are right. `
`Let's ask Father!! `
`Your turn is already over, Nii-san, Natsuhi nee-san!!" `
`"Yeah, yeah!! `
`Bring Father out to us!! `
`We won't get anywhere with just you two! `
`Let's begin the real family conference!! `
`Does this look like something you can put off just because he's tired?! `
`If we take this thing lightly, we'll have a massive problem on our hands...! `
`Hey, are you listening?!! `
`We won't get anywhere with just you!! `
`Bring Father out right noooooow!!!" `
`".........Are family conferences always like this?" `
`"...How the hell'd I know?" `
`"They're probably always like this on the inside. `
`......Heheheheh. `
`Looks like they won't be able to get this figured out right now without Kinzo-san. `
`...To think he's being called out to settle his children's fight, even though it's been announced that he has only a short while to live. `
`...I wonder how he feels right about now. `
`*giggle* `
`Imagining that...no, reasoning that out will be a treat." `
`The parents ignored Battler and Erika...and kept yelling at each other, on and on... `
`Even though Battler had more or less imagined that this sort of thing happened behind the scenes, this was the first time he'd seen it. `
`He'd suspected it since six years ago, `
`and he'd been able to get a pretty good idea of what this was like by the darkening expressions on his parents' faces when this time of year drew near... `
`However, this argument his relatives were having before his very eyes... `
`...was much more... `
`...ugly than he'd imagined... `
`That's why he was very glad that he'd called the adults out here without letting the cousins catch wind of anything... `
`Perhaps because everyone was tired out from this seemingly endless argument, they took a short break. `
`It was decided that this family conference inside the Golden Land should be moved over to the mansion... `
`This place may have been gorgeous, like a VIP room, but there was no heating, and it was a little cold. `
`It wasn't well suited for a long conversation. `
`They thought of the possibility that someone might snatch the gold away while their backs were turned, `
`but of course, no one could manage much with just human hands and a small amount of time when it's 10 tons of gold they're dealing with. `
`In fact, it might be said that having this mountain of gold in the background was actually robbing them of the ability to make sound decisions. `
`So they agreed to return to the mansion, in part so that they could regain their composure and continue the conference more cold-bloodedly... `
`"...Then, if you would excuse me for the night. `
`...I imagine I'd just get in the way if I remained any longer." `
`"Sure, sorry. `
`Did we bother you too much?" `
`"Let us show our gratitude again tomorrow. `
`Sorry for letting you see such an embarrassing side of us." `
`"You said that you refused, `
`but allow us to prepare a fitting portion, out of gratitude, for you as one of the first to discover the gold. `
`Right, Nii-san?" `
`"...Yes. `
`We know what you're capable of. `
`I think you can grasp our current circumstances." `
`20 billion yen in gold isn't something they wanted out in the open. `
`They didn't want an outsider like Erika telling people about it. `
`Of course, Erika had already "reasoned out" that much. `
`She wore an unpleasant smile on her face, as though she understood all too well... `
`"...You don't need to worry about me. `
`Of course, I have no desire to tell anyone else about this. `
`...And if I did, no one would believe me without proof." `
`"......I got to see something interesting tonight. `
`It was quite a spectacle, so I'm more than satisfied." `
`"Heheh, I see. `
`I guess it's not every day you see 10 tons of gold." `
`...Seeing the gold was the spectacle? `
`Of course not. `
`Judging by Erika's dark nature, it's obvious what she's so happy about. `
`I thought about telling her to just go away, but even I wanted to get out of this place... `
`I tried to head back to the guesthouse along with Erika. `
`However, Kyrie-san grabbed my shoulder. `
`"You can't go, Battler-kun. `
`Please come with us." `
`"Yes, yes. `
`You're now a real Successor! `
`You've gotta have an audience with Father and have him acknowledge you right away...!" `
`"That's something only the Family Head may decide!! `
`Don't make things up on your own!" `
`"...Battler, `
`I realize it'll be a pain, but stick around with us for a bit longer. `
`Don't say anything. `
`Just stay quiet and keep your head down. `
`Got it?" `
`".........Just do whatever you want." `
`It would have been easy to say that I had no interest in being the Successor. `
`...But I was sure that would only add more oil to the fire. `
`Even if I hadn't been ordered to keep quiet, staying shut up like a clam was clearly a good idea... `
`In that case, would it really be so bad if they just let me go back to the guesthouse...? `
`Dad put his arm firmly around my shoulder, and I told him it was uncomfortable and to let go. `
`However, he didn't pay attention to a word I said... `
`"......I've solved the epitaph. `
`Just like you wanted." `
`"..............." `
`"When you were the Game Master, we'd always get those letters. `
`..."Try and solve the epitaph". `
`"If you don't, I'll kill you all"." `
`"..............." `
`......Why did she want to make us solve the riddle of the epitaph? `
`By solving it, we found a mountain of gold. `
`Yippee for us. `
`And what about Beato? `
`...Does she gain anything...by having us find the gold? `
`Or does she lose something...? `
`"...As far as chessboard thinking tells us, ...people don't ever make moves that cause them to lose something. `
`That means you must have something to gain by having us solve the epitaph..." `
`"No. `
`{p:1:This child has nothing to gain from having someone solve the epitaph}." `
`"......Are you sure that's okay? `
`...Using red like that without her permission." `
`"...This child most likely wishes for it." `
`{f:5:Virgilia}, who had suddenly appeared there, quickly gave an answer to my question with the red truth... `
`"In the past, I sometimes guessed that Beato tried to make us solve the epitaph... `
`because she wanted to make us find the gold's hiding place for her, so she could snatch it away. `
`......Is that wrong too?" `
`"Yes. `
`...In the first place, `
`{p:1:the gold of the Golden Land belongs to her from the start}. `
`{p:1:She has absolutely no need to make anyone find it for her or to snatch it away herself}." `
`Of course. `
`...Beato is {f:5:Beatrice} the Golden. `
`Isn't she the master of the Golden Land and the Ushiromiya family alchemist? `
`...That totally makes sense. `
`However, that makes me even more confused. `
`...Even if someone exposed the answer to the epitaph's riddle, Beato has nothing to gain. `
`No, to the contrary, her own gold might be stolen away. `
`"In that case, I'm understanding this less and less. `
`......I understand the epitaph murders. `
`It might be revenge against the Ushiromiya family, or else a ceremony to revive her powers as a witch. `
`...After all, she's probably doing it because of some reason or goal of her own." `
`"..............." `
`"But what's the point of her telling us to solve the epitaph? `
`Whether we solve it or not, she has nothing to gain at all. `
`...In other words, the whole issue of whether the epitaph is solved or not...is immaterial in Beato's eyes." `
`"...You're right. `
`{p:1:Whether the epitaph's riddle is solved or not, she has nothing at all to gain from it}." `
`"It doesn't matter whether it's solved or not. `
`...In other words, could we say that the epitaph's riddle itself is immaterial to Beato...?" `
`"............ `
`...You're right. `
`The epitaph's riddle doesn't have any meaning for this child. `
`So even if you take it to an extreme and call the epitaph's riddle immaterial, it may not be possible to argue against your claim..." `
`"..............." `
`Beato... `
`...Why are you making us solve the epitaph's riddle...? `
`If we liken the witch you are to a pair of scales, the epitaph murders lie on one plate... `
`And the riddle of the epitaph lies on the other plate. `
`After all, she's saying she'll stop the epitaph murders if the epitaph is solved. `
`...In other words, the epitaph murders and the epitaph's riddle are worth the same to Beato. `
`Like two sides on a balanced scale. `
`That means that both the epitaph's riddle and massacring all the relatives... `
`are equally significant from Beato's point of view...... `
`But {f:5:Virgilia} responded with the red truth. `
`{p:1:Regardless of whether the epitaph is solved or not, Beato has nothing to gain}. `
`If she has nothing to gain, then this epitaph's riddle...is meaningless and immaterial to Beato. `
`In that case, how much are the epitaph murders, which lie on the other side of the scales and are equal to the epitaph's riddle in value, `
`...worth to her...? `
`...Think, don't stop thinking... `
`The epitaph murders and solving the riddle of the epitaph have equal worth. `
`As long as the epitaph murders, which are Beato's goal each time, have this single way that they can be stopped, a way that she decided on herself, both are worth the same thing to her. `
`X=Y. `
`And whether the epitaph's riddle is solved or not, Beato has nothing to gain. `
`Y=0. `
`So, in this case, ...what is X...? `
`"..............." `
`"...Wait a sec. `
`...That means the epitaph murders are also meaningless and immaterial." `
`"...Every time she performs these bizarre serial murders, `
`she's willing to spend an incredible amount of effort to politely send advance notice... `
`and then kills us one by one in accordance with the epitaph, never getting exposed. `
`So all of that is meaningless to her...?" `
`I spun the chessboard around and searched through Beato's moves over and over. `
`This is always the first place I stumble. `
`The significance of the epitaph murders. `
`Why did she have to commit serial murders in a way that reproduced the witch's epitaph? `
`If she wanted to kill the whole Ushiromiya family for revenge, it'd be much simpler, safer, and more reliable if she just put poison into their dinner... `
`or else went around killing people one by one in the middle of the night while they were sleeping. `
`However, on the first evening, Beato sent us a letter that sounded like an advance notice... `
`and then carried out a three-part serial murder with large gaps in between: `
`the six people of the first twilight, the two people of the second twilight, and the five people of the fourth and later twilights. `
`We aren't fools. `
`Once the first murders occur, we barricade ourselves in somewhere to stave off any further murders. `
`Furthermore, we quickly suspect a culprit among us and start analyzing each other's alibis. `
`As the victims increase, the number of suspects decreases automatically, `
`and Beato's chances of success in this serial murder drop closer and closer to zero... `
`All the epitaph murders...are like she's strangling her own neck, making it harder to succeed in this serial murder she's attempting. `
`...All for a useless embellishment, ...all just for show. `
`"......She's raising the difficulty of completing her own objective." `
`"That does follow. `
`...She really is a strange child." `
`"Did you know? `
`In mystery novels, they call things like these epitaph murders "plotline murders". `
`...I think you can split the possible motives for plotline murders like this into three groups." `
`"...And what are those?" `
`"Well, first off, maybe following the epitaph gives rise to misconceptions about evidence and alibis, which might benefit the culprit. `
`...Pretending to be dead and mixing yourself in with the victims would fit this pattern, `
`as would committing murders that don't actually follow the epitaph, giving yourself an alibi by getting people to incorrectly guess the order of events." `
`"I see. `
`So perhaps she only made it look as though she was killing them in a ceremonial fashion, following the epitaph, ...when she was actually guiding their thinking in a manner that benefited her. `
`I do find that intriguing." `
`"......However, in our games, the dead are truly down for the count thanks to the red. `
`...While she might've confused people in the world of the game board, she can't confuse us up here like that. `
`...In other words, the most obvious possible goal for her...isn't the real one." `
`"In that case, what are the other two possible reasons for carrying out plotline murders?" `
`"Another one is coincidence. `
`...A crime just happens to resemble the epitaph, without anyone in particular trying to make it do so, `
`and the witnesses mistakenly think it's a plotline murder. `
`Humans try to find cause and effect in everything they see. `
`...If we think we know what something is, then that's how it looks to us." `
`"...I see. `
`That's intriguing too. `
`...But would that really work? `
`In this child's games, advance notice of the crime is always given before the murders of the first twilight. `
`Also, I believe you've repeatedly found letters and circumstantial evidence that clearly show that the culprit is carrying out epitaph murders." `
`"Yeah, that's right. `
`......It isn't coincidence. `
`From the very beginning, Beato's been advancing with the goal of making this look like a series of epitaph murders. `
`We weren't mistaken about that. `
`These are clear "plotline murders". `
`So, this motive—or lack of motive—doesn't work either." `
`"In that case, ...there's only one motive left, right?" `
`"The last one......is because they want to show someone something. `
`More specifically, fear. `
`...By following the epitaph, she gives the others clear notice in advance that the murders will continue. `
`The survivors are in constant fear of the murders, which they're certain will continue." `
`"..............." `
`"In other words, `
`...this child performed these epitaph murders to make someone feel the fear of death?" `
`"Or at least, ...that'd explain things pretty well. `
`...The grotesque mutilation of corpses and the dark decorations were all a show to terrify us..." `
`"To terrify whom...?" `
`"Huh? `
`...Well, like I said, us. `
`............" `
`After hearing that one line {f:5:Virgilia} spoke so casually, ...my thoughts clouded over once again... `
`Is it really sufficient to use `
`the vague word "us"...? `
`There are many humans in the Ushiromiya family. `
`There's the Head and the one who holds the rank of his Successor, ...Grandfather and Uncle Krauss. `
`There's the relatives, who have some pull in the business world. `
`...On the other side, you have the young cousins, who usually visit at most once a year, `
`and the unfortunate servants, who just happened to be on duty that day. `
`...Even if the culprit hates all of us, `
`...there should be clear differences in how much they hate some of us compared to others. `
`So, it should be possible to pick out people among us that the culprit especially wanted to terrorize or have revenge against. `
`If we liken this to a kid eating dessert... `
`Isn't the strawberry on top of a shortcake the part you should eat last? `
`No one tells you that you shouldn't eat it first, but our mentality encourages us to save it for later. `
`"......In that case, ...the culprit would want to leave the person they hated most until the end. `
`...Yeah, like that line by my favorite character in this novel I like. `
`Something about how the worst way to kill someone is to 'murder those close to them first, `
`make them as miserable as possible, and only kill the person then'." `
`"Oh my, that must have been quite a terrifying novel. `
`How frightening..." `
`"...In that case, you could argue that the people who stay alive until the end are the ones Beato hates the most. `
`...However, every single time, the order people get killed changes around completely. `
`...If we try counting up the people who live until the last twilight every single time, `
`even though they do die in the end, `
`......... `
`............" `
`"..............." `
`...I'm the only one. `
`"......Let me first speak with the red. `
`{p:1:Battler‐kun, you are not the culprit}. `
`{p:1:You haven't killed anyone}. `
`{p:1:This can be said of all games}." `
`"Then that......just makes it even more likely that it's me. `
`...It means the sole reason she had for bringing about the epitaph murders...was to show them to me." `
`Every time, Beato brags that she'll choose whom to kill next with a roulette. `
`However, I'm the only one she never kills. `
`...Though she does kill me in the end, she leaves me be until the very last moment. `
`In all of these supposedly random games, there's only this one unchanging constant... `
`"She wants......revenge? Against me? `
`So, is she performing the epitaph murders to make me feel fear...?" `
`"That's wrong. `
`......{p:1:Her goal is not to make someone experience fear}. `
`{p:1:And it isn't to have revenge on someone either}." `
`"In that case, `
`the epitaph murders really don't mean anything to her! `
`The epitaph's riddle is meaningless, and the corresponding epitaph murders are also meaningless. `
`X=Y=0! `
`But even so, she's clearly trying to show these meaningless things to me!" `
`"What could she want from me...that'd be worth the same to her as something meaningless?! `
`...I don't get it!! `
`The more I think about it, the less I understand what she's thinking!" `
`"..............." `
`{f:5:Beatrice}, `
`the fickle witch who committed a meaningless, worthless string of serial murders. `
`Even the epitaph's riddle, which that witch used as the trigger that could suspend the serial murders, `
`...is meaningless, immaterial. `
`And yet...she's thrusting this meaningless, immaterial thing in front of my face. `
`...What is it...that you want from me...? `
`...Or else, what is it that you're giving me...? `
`My idea that Beato has clearly been taking revenge on me...has already been denied by {f:5:Virgilia}'s red truth. `
`Both X and Y. `
`Both the epitaph murders and the epitaph's riddle hold no meaning for {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`X=Y=0. `
`However, since she's thrusting those things in front of me, `
`...they must... `
`...have some meaning. `
`She showed us the scales representing "if you don't solve the epitaph, I'll carry out the epitaph murders". `
`In other words, neither the epitaph murders nor the epitaph's riddle have any significance by themselves. `
`However, it becomes meaningful when she puts both halves on the scales and puts them on display before us......no, before me. `
`...In other words, it should be like this: `
`X=0. `
`Y=0. `
`X+Y>0. `
`A scale with meaningless, weightless things on both sides. `
`However, it has weight itself...and gives the rest meaning. `
`"...It's almost like...playing. `
`Like kids playing rock, paper, scissors." `
`Rock, paper, scissors is an extremely familiar method of randomly determining a winner and loser. `
`You sometimes wager some sort of reward on the outcome, `
`...but kids often do rock, paper, scissors just to play, without betting anything in particular. `
`Unless you bet something, you have nothing to gain or lose except happiness and frustration. `
`In other words, the two sides of the scale, both winning and losing, are immaterial. `
`However, the very act of seeing which way it will tip... `
`is the reason kids play rock, paper, scissors. `
`After all, the kids are enjoying the communication that surrounds the game, `
`...and they aren't purely interested in the value of winning or losing. `
`They aren't overly concerned about who wins and who loses... `
`"That would mean it doesn't matter to Beato...whether the epitaph murders succeed or not. `
`...It almost feels like she's just enjoying the process." `
`"............" `
`"...In the past, ...I cursed her, deciding that she was a heartless witch who kept murdering people for no reason. `
`...But right now, I can't imagine that's true." `
`"......Thank you. `
`In that case, I'll give you one more line of red. `
`...{p:1:Beato never committed murder for the sake of pleasure}." `
`She didn't do it for pleasure, and she didn't do it to make anyone feel fear. `
`Since she has nothing to gain, `
`she doesn't care whether the epitaph murders succeed or fail. `
`It's almost like...a random game kids would play... `
`"That's not right. `
`...It does have meaning. `
`It has meaning for her." `
`"......And what is...this meaning...?" `
`"I don't get it. `
`Even though both sides of the scale are immaterial, ...the scale itself has some weight to it in her eyes." `
`...Of course it isn't meaningless. `
`Some meaning definitely exists. `
`In the previous game, she urged me to remember my sin of six years ago. `
`...Am I supposed to believe that was meaningless too? `
`No. `
`That definitely isn't the case. `
`I clearly remember the serious gaze Beato had back then. `
`Unfortunately, I didn't have a clue what she meant. `
`...When she saw that, she was horribly dejected. `
`That's right. `
`At that time, I'm sure she even went so far as to say that the crime wouldn't have occurred if I hadn't come. `
`"It does have meaning. `
`......It means something to her. `
`And it's connected to something she wants from me." `
`"....................." `
`I laughed softly and poked Beato lightly on the head, `
`...then patted her head. `
`"...Next time you want to send a love letter, I suggest you just write "I love you". `
`...If you make it too roundabout and confusing, no one's gonna be able to figure it out." `
`"......*giggle*." `
`"I still don't have a clue what she's thinking. `
`...Even so, `
`I won't stop thinking. `
`...I've only just started spinning the chessboard around. `
`...I definitely won't give up...on this journey in search of your thoughts." `
