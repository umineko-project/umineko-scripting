`"Then let's all assume that I did it, okay?! `
`That's what you want me to say, right?! `
`Waaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh...!!!" `
`As though she'd given up and decided that it'd be useless to try and talk her way out of this any longer, `
`Aunt Natsuhi screamed that out. `
`...It was a sad incident. `
`I wanted to believe that, despite the pitiable circumstances that led to her marriage into the Ushiromiya family, `
`...Natsuhi just might have been able to grasp a sliver of happiness together with Uncle Krauss and Jessica. `
`...However, by Aunt Natsuhi's own doing, Uncle Krauss... `
`and even her beloved daughter Jessica... `
`had been heartlessly killed... `
`It was even harder to believe that Grandfather had been an accomplice and hid the corpses... `
`However, judging by the clear testimony given by several people who knew him, `
`Grandfather's mental state for these last few years has been far from what anyone would consider normal. `
`Perhaps, possessed by a mad devotion to the mistress he had lost long ago, `
`...Grandfather might truly have believed that Aunt Natsuhi was a reincarnation of {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`Where is Grandfather now? `
`Like Erika had theorized, `
`did he really believe that he could revive {f:5:Beatrice} by carrying out murders following the epitaph, `
`succumbing to Natsuhi's cajolery? `
`...Right now, is he holding some kind of disturbing ceremony with the bodies he carried away...? `
`"Are you...... `
`...satisfied now......? `
`...This... `
`...is what you wanted to make me say, right...?" `
`Aunt Natsuhi sobbed as she spoke. `
`"...This is... `
`......your revenge, isn't it...? `
`You, the man from 19 years ago...!!" `
`This "man from 19 years ago" that Aunt Natsuhi kept mentioning was supposedly someone who had caught her in some sort of trap. `
`However, she had only mentioned that this man from 19 years ago existed, `
`and she most certainly hadn't tried to explain what had happened 19 years ago... `
`"I'm sure...that man's underling is one among us here. `
`...I'm sure that right now, that man is ridiculing me through one of you..." `
`"......Then tell me...! `
`Are you happy now? `
`Has a bit of that pain and suffering you've endured for 19 years gone away...?! `
`......I finally understand. `
`...The reason you've cornered me so far...is because...you wanted to make me acknowledge that, right...?" `
`"...Natsuhi-san, `
`other than us, there's absolutely no one here. `
`Please stop this insanely desperate charade and quit pretending that someone who doesn't exist actually does." `
`Erika laughed mockingly, but, as Aunt Natsuhi looked at us... `
`...No, as she looked at some being behind us, ...she hung her head and shook. `
`Then, ......she confessed to her sin. `
`"I......committed murder..." `
`"So, you've finally acknowledged your crime directly." `
`"No, `
`this is not about what has happened today and yesterday. `
`......I will confess to a murder that occurred 19 years ago." `
`The adults all whispered together, wondering what this was about. `
`...Because they had never heard about a murder case 19 years ago. `
`"N-Nineteen years ago, `
`...I......committed a sin. `
`......I couldn't forgive it. `
`...That......baby...!!" `
`"Baby? `
`Now what are you talking about?" `
`"...On that day 19 years ago, `
`...Father entrusted me with a baby. `
`......Since I still couldn't bear a successor on my own, Father told me to adopt a child, `
`...and he made me hold a baby that he said had been brought here from an orphanage..." `
`"Do you have any idea...how humiliating that was to me as a woman...?!" `
`With a mix of conflicting emotions, of anger, sadness, regret and possibly defiance, `
`Aunt Natsuhi confessed. `
`Her humiliation as a woman when she was no longer expected to bear a child. `
`And also, the indescribably unpleasant feeling of being made to hold an unfamiliar baby. `
`It caused her great sadness and rage, `
`and before very many nights passed, it ate a hole into her heart... `
`And then, ...I sold my soul to demons... `
`......It happened when I went on a walk through the rose garden to the harbor, along with a servant holding the baby... `
`...I wanted to be alone, `
`...but that female servant holding the baby faithfully followed me everywhere. `
`I was unable even to tell her to stop following me, ...and therefore unable to escape from the child's crying...... `
`......That day... `
`marked the beginning of 19 long, headache-filled years... `
`......Then, we faced the cliff from across the fence. `
`If by taking that baby... `
`and throwing it down onto the rocky beach far below me, `
`...I could undo it all... `
`...I really did listen to that demon's temptation. `
`"Then, ......for the smallest of moments, I thought of how wonderful it would be if I really could do that, `
`...and lent an ear to that temptation. `
`...At that time-" `
`The servant holding the baby stepped on a large rock, twisted her ankle, and staggered... `
`She leaned against the rough fence, ...and at that time, I thought I heard the fence creak loudly. `
`I told her to look out and tried to grab her shoulder. `
`"...No, `
`...I shouldn't be so vague... `
`I'll repent. `
`I'll confess. `
`......At that moment, I'm sure that...as I told her to look out, `
`.........with both hands, `
`I reached for that servant's shoulder, `
`and with a thud, `
`...pushed her away hard..." `
`The rough fence snapped from the base, `
`......and the servant, `
`...along with the baby held in her arms, `
`......fell down towards the rocky beach below... `
`Even though... `
`...I remember that moment vividly, `
`...for some reason I recall a vague... `
`and very strange feeling. `
`It almost felt as though instead of falling, `
`...the two of them were silently swallowed up into empty space. `
`So I didn't even hear the sound of them crashing to the rocky beach. `
`No, I'm sure I heard it. `
`But because I wanted to think that they'd disappeared, `
`...I must have erased that sound from my memory... `
`"......And then......?" `
`"For an instant, ...I thought it was a dream. `
`...It was high enough that I couldn't see the two of them below me just by leaning over. `
`So I didn't know whether their fall...or the few seconds before that...had actually happened or not..." `
`I must have been wishing so strongly that the child would fall... `
`that I just had a daydream... `
`Trying to make myself believe this, I hurried back to the rose garden. `
`...Then, I decided to let the servant take care of the baby, choosing to take a rest alone in the garden... `
`......Then, `
`.........Father asked what had happened to the baby, `
`......... `
`......and an uproar began over the disappearance of the servant `
`who had been in charge of it......... `
`Eventually, the broken fence was discovered, `
`......and two corpses were found at the bottom of the cliff... `
`...The child had apparently been here for reasons that couldn't become known, so its existence was hushed up, `
`...and the official story was that the servant had had an accident on her own and died. `
`That's right. `
`I...stole away two innocent lives in one go...... `
`As for the poor servant, ...her family was graciously compensated. `
`Her aged husband, who didn't know the truth, accepted this even though he grieved over the unfortunate accident. `
`Then, just a few years ago, he died of old age, ......and I confessed the truth over his grave, apologizing. `
`"......But until this day, `
`...I have never apologized to that baby. `
`...Yes, `
`......that's what you're after, isn't it...?" `
`"So right here, right now, I'll confess to my crime! `
`...I, Ushiromiya Natsuhi, `
`......did 19 years ago... `
`...push you off a cliff... `
`and try to kill you..." `
`...But... `
`you didn't die, did you...? `
`......You're still alive, `
`...and you still call me "Mother"... `
`......You came to this island... `
`and took your revenge on me, didn't you...? `
`For these 19 years... `
`...You knew that the one you should have called your mother pushed you off a cliff, `
`...and you must have lived a very hate-filled life... `
`"...And now, ...you've taken everything I've gained since pushing you off that cliff, `
`18 years of my life, ...and smashed it all to pieces... `
`...I no longer have my beloved husband and daughter. `
`...And I've lost even my honor... `
`and am being called a murderer... `
`......No, ...I really am a murderer, aren't I..." `
`"Yes, that's right. `
`...It all went according to your plans. `
`...I'm now regarded as a killer... `
`.........How's that...? `
`Is this enough... `
`for your revenge...? `
`My husband and daughter have been killed, `
`...I've been made to look like a murderer, ...like an adulteress even... `
`After seeing me living in disgrace like this, `
`.........are you satisfied...?! `
`Yes, I'll bet you're quite satisfied... `
`...Because my family... `
`...my honor... `
`...everything......has been stolen from me... `
`...Ooohh, `
`...*hic*... `
`aaaaaaagggghhhhhh!!" `
`"......After all this, do you still claim that you were framed? `
`Seriously, you just don't know when to give up." `
`"Can you hear me?! You, the cursed child from 19 years ago...!! `
`Are you satisfied now?! `
`You've stolen everything from me now!! `
`What else could you want?! `
`...Please, `
`...just... `
`......forgive me......" `
`{a:c: `
`"...It's useless, isn't it..."} `
`"Huh......?" `
`"......Battler-san, `
`did you say something?" `
`{a:c: `
`"It's all useless."} `
`"......B- `
`Battler...ku...n...?" `
`"......Yeah. `
`...It's useless, isn't it...? `
`It's all useless..." `
`"Ah, `
`......aaahhhh.........!!" `
