`...Battler did nothing but gaze blankly out the window. `
`The fighting between the relatives went on without end... `
`At first, the relatives had crowded around the study. `
`However, no matter how much they knocked, the master of the study did not answer even once. `
`Eva and several others said they should open the door with the second key, the one Genji held. `
`However, in a flash of brilliance, Natsuhi said that Kinzo had been in a particularly bad mood and had taken back the key he'd previously given Genji, `
`which meant that he now had both keys himself. `
`She claimed that this was the reason they couldn't open the door. `
`After she promised to let them meet Kinzo tomorrow morning no matter what, they finally returned to the dining hall. `
`But, of course, the argument continued on even there. `
`Eva's group needed a lot of cash very soon, and they were trying to threaten Krauss somehow and make him pay up. `
`...Apparently, Battler solving the epitaph threatened Krauss's position as the Successor, `
`which gave the others a powerful tailwind. `
`On the other side, Krauss and Natsuhi based their argument on the claim... `
`that it had never been specified that ownership of the gold would be handed over to the person who solved the epitaph. `
`It hadn't been "hidden gold", but simply Kinzo's stockpile, `
`and it was still Kinzo's property, which meant it would naturally be distributed after Kinzo's death with the rest of the inheritance. `
`Once they made that claim, Eva's group once again started demanding to be allowed to see Kinzo. `
`...It had probably been obvious to them from the beginning. `
`This sibling fight could only be settled by Kinzo... `
`This was obviously a confrontation between Eva's group, which wanted cash fast, `
`and Krauss, who was hiding his lack of funds but still didn't need money right away. `
`As he listened vaguely to this exchange, `
`...Battler marveled at how, despite their usual affluent airs, they were surprisingly deep in debt... `
`"Didn't you say the same thing a short while ago? `
`Enough, let's take a break. `
`We're all repeating the same things over and over again." `
`According to the clock, it was almost 24:00. `
`It certainly was a perfect time for a break. `
`The atmosphere relaxed just a bit... `
`"I agree. `
`It'll be good for both sides to take a breather. `
`...Hey, why don't we start keepin' a record when we start up again? `
`I'm tired of fightin' over what was or wasn't said." `
`"Seriously. `
`We really can't do without a record of proceedings, not when Nii-san can so easily deny something he's said before the words stop reverberating off the walls." `
`"A mere written record would be a pain, and it'd be an easy target for forgery." `
`"Good point. `
`...Aniki, wanna fire this up?" `
`"A tape set, is it? `
`...I see. `
`This way, we can keep a record without bothering to write it down, and forgery will be impossible. `
`It's fair for both sides." `
`"Make sure you don't mess anything up...! `
`Those are Father's precious music tapes!" `
`The dignified tape set had a sense of weight to it that matched this majestic dining hall perfectly. `
`On pleasant Sunday mornings, it would sometimes be used to play famous tapes or records. `
`However, right now, it was the most neutral and impartial conference record keeper around... `
`Rudolf fished randomly around the cassette rack, searching for a blank tape. `
`And every time he found some tape with "sophisticated" music on it, he'd complain about how pompous it was. `
`"Pardon me. `
`...You called?" `
`"We're taking a break. `
`Sorry, but could you make us something to drink? `
`And maybe some biscuits would be nice too." `
`"Certainly. `
`I will see to it right away..." `
`"Also, ...sorry, `
`but do you have any cold medicine? `
`I've been feeling a bit feverish." `
`"Then don't overstrain yourself. `
`Get some sleep." `
`"If you really feel like it, why not get some sleep, Rosa? `
`Of course, I wouldn't step out of such an important conference because of a simple cold." `
`"Really? `
`Allow me to take a rest as well. `
`Natsuhi, why don't we take a short rest too." `
`".........Yes, dear." `
`Sensing that he meant to have a strategy meeting, Natsuhi stood up. `
`...Even if that hadn't been the case, she was so desperate to get out of the room even for a moment that she'd have taken any excuse. `
`Krauss and Natsuhi left the dining hall, ...and the tension in the room truly relaxed. `
`".........*sigh*." `
`"You've been doing great, Battler-kun. `
`...I imagine you feel just horrible. `
`Think of this as part of growing up and just accept it." `
`"Just how long am I gonna have to sit around here doing nothing?" `
`"...Who knows. `
`After all, you're like our own portable shrine. `
`...Sleepy?" `
`"About as much in as your average school class." `
`"I'm pretty sure Father isn't going to show up tonight anyway. `
`When Krauss nii-san and the rest come back, I'll propose that we might as well let you go." `
`"...I'll be counting on you." `
`*knock*knock*. `
`A light knock and the faint sound of china clinking together could be heard. `
`"Excuse us..." `
`"We brought tea." `
`Shannon and Kanon had come by with a serving cart. `
`The pleasant smell of black tea had the effect of relieving a bit of the tension. `
`"...Hey, `
`did you hear?" `
`"Hear about what...?" `
`".........We haven't heard anything." `
`"Stop it, Rudolf. `
`There's no reason to tell them." `
`"...We are furniture, `
`so we have no interest in matters concerning the family conference." `
`"I see. `
`That's a wise answer." `
`"...You have the midnight shift? `
`That must be rough." `
`"That is our job. `
`...We would be happy to receive your orders." `
`"Makes sense to me. `
`At least that'd be better than sittin' around awake doing nothin'. `
`When I was still down in the bottom rungs, I once worked as a warehouse keeper. `
`Even if you're just stayin' awake, it's still pretty tough...! `
`Right after the war, you had robbers all over the place. `
`Plus, you couldn't rely on the police back then, so it was a pretty dangerous time...!" `
`Hideyoshi was particularly proud of how he'd started with nothing and built up assets by illegally diverting goods from the American army. `
`Once the subject came up, Hideyoshi tended to get pretty talkative. `
`The relatives who knew this were greatly relieved to see that a perfect sacrifice had come up. `
`"If you got found out, you were in for it big time! `
`Those Americandy people are scary! `
`Their strength's in another league 'cause of all that beef they eat. `
`If you got caught, it'd end with them shooting you or <death by hanging>! `
`Get it? <Death by hanging>! `
`Oh yeah, and then, I figured it out. `
`It's all about the meat! `
`Japanese people gotta eat more meat! `
`And that's when I got the revelation...that I needed to start up a business to win over people's stomachs!" `
`"I-I see... `
`That m-must have been quite a difficult task......" `
`"Stop it, dear. `
`No matter how much you tell people born after the war, they'll never understand how we suffered back then." `
`"Oops, looks like my bad habit's jumped out again...! `
`Sorry, sorry! `
`Wahahahahaha!" `
`"You two should have some tea as well. `
`Every now and then, I think it might be helpful for you to use your own tongues to learn more about the tea you're always brewing." `
`"......No, we'll be fine. `
`There's no need to be concerned for our sakes..." `
`"Hang out with us for a bit. `
`Being surrounded by adults makes me feel like I'm gonna suffocate." `
`"Hear that? That's an order from Battler-sama, the Successor! `
`Sit over there and have some tea with us. `
`Then you can talk about recent events, your hobbies, TV shows you're watching, and whatever it is that's popular with the kids these days. `
`There's a lot we could learn." `
`"*giggle* `
`That's a brilliant idea. `
`Come on, you two sit down too. `
`And why don't you become sacrifices for us now that we crave something to talk about." `
`"Wahahahahahaha. `
`That's right. `
`I thought it'd be nice to talk to some young kids, but that'll be pretty hard when I'm too old even to go to a cabaret club." `
`"...How long are you planning on standing around there? `
`Rudolf told you to sit. `
`Sit down. `
`...I give you permission as well." `
`After getting Eva's permission, Shannon and Kanon looked at each other and finally obeyed, nervously. `
`For a while, the two were pounded by questions and became the relatives' playthings... `
`Then, `
`...a reserved knocking sound could be heard. `
`All of the servants tended to knock in a similar manner, `
`so no one found it strange. `
`However, Shannon and Kanon turned around with surprised looks on their faces. `
`...The servants here today included the two of them, Genji, Kumasawa, and Gohda. `
`Gohda had the midnight shift at the guesthouse. `
`Kumasawa had gone to bed in a spare room in the guesthouse. `
`The two of them were right here, ...so Genji was the only person left, `
`...but they knew very well that Genji wouldn't knock like that... `
`"...Who is it? `
`It's not locked. Just come in." `
`Rudolf didn't recognize the knock either. `
`When he asked "Who is it?", it became apparent that no one knew whose knock it was... `
`After that, the same *knock*knock* repeated just once more. `
`...Could it be that someone had their hands full...and was asking that the door be opened for them...? `
`As a slightly odd feeling began to encompass the room, the sound of the large clock in the hall could be heard. `
`It was a sign that October 4th had ended...and October 5th had begun... `
`Let's step back in time a bit. `
`At this time, Krauss and Natsuhi were a ways off, in a deserted corridor on the second floor... `
`"......So, we no longer have any other options." `
`"Yes... `
`...The same move probably won't last us all day tomorrow. `
`...If we hesitate any longer, there's a chance Eva-san and the others will call the police, claiming that we have Father locked up somewhere. `
`This is...as far as we can go." `
`"..............." `
`"...Battler-kun finding the gold...was completely unexpected. `
`If that hadn't happened, I'd thought of a plan which might have managed to get us through this somehow..." `
`"...Hmph. `
`This always happens when I bet on something. `
`...Something unexpected always happens, and something that should've been an absolute certainty goes wrong." `
`"......Let's arrange for Father's room to be "empty" starting tomorrow morning. `
`Let's plan it out with Genji and have him say he saw Father heading out into the forest early in the morning." `
`"I doubt Eva and the others will simply accept such a disappearance..." `
`"I'm fully aware of that. `
`However, we have no other options...!" `
`"If we do such a thing, ...Eva and the others will doubtless make a fuss that our actions were suspicious. `
`They aren't worried about appearances as long as they can squeeze some money out of us. `
`...It might end up in some odd magazine and cause serious damage to the confidence placed in me." `
`"Damage is something we can live with, right...?! `
`If by any chance Father's secret is discovered, we'll face a lot worse than mere damage...!!" `
`"There's nothing wrong with persisting until the last possible second tomorrow. `
`If we're able to make it through safely, we won't have to lose anything. `
`There's no need to get impatient and use that trump card...!" `
`"You want to wait until after they start clambering about how we've locked Father up, and then say he's gone missing? `
`That way would invite much more suspicion...!!" `
`"............Nnnn..." `
`"...Let's just... `
`put Father to rest now... `
`To go any further... `
`...would be impossible..." `
`"Calm yourself. `
`Being exposed to Eva and the others' venom too much has made you lose your composure, that's all. `
`...Only two keys exist that can let anyone into that study! `
`And you have both of them right here. `
`That means no one can go inside. `
`That door is of a very special make. `
`No matter what kind of tools they bring out of the storage room, it won't even budge." `
`"It isn't a physical problem like that...!" `
`"Please, don't be hasty, and calm down. `
`In any event, you can pretend to have gotten a fever and stay in bed. `
`In the meantime, I will overcome all of this for you." `
`"...I can't leave everything to you...! `
`I'll fight until the end too...!" `
`When Natsuhi could no longer hold back the tears brought on by her fierce emotions, ...Krauss held her gently. `
`...Just how long had it been since the last time she'd felt the warmth of her husband's compassion... `
`"Your headache......must be awful, yes? `
`It's always that way when you wrinkle your forehead like that." `
`".........Dear..." `
`She had come to think that her husband could never guess the way she felt. `
`But, ...at times like this...... `
`"...Let's wait for the very last moment before using our disappearance trump card. `
`It's like a last-resort treasured sword. `
`It's best when it remains in its sheath. `
`The important thing is that you're ready to pull it out at any time, right...?" `
`"I...understand that..." `
`"Would you let me handle that trump card? `
`......Of course, at the final moment, I will take all of the responsibility. `
`...I won't get you and Jessica involved." `
`"What...do you mean by that...?!" `
`"When the Ushiromiya family is destroyed, it is enough that I alone am crushed in the rubble. `
`......When the typhoon passes, let's make sure we're ready to file for divorce. `
`I will sign the papers and let you hold onto them. `
`...I've secretly left some of my assets in your name. `
`If you add on some compensation money, that should be enough for you and Jessica to live on without any hindrances." `
`"No!! `
`Ushiromiya Natsuhi is the name that should be engraved on my tombstone...! `
`Please let me be with you until the last moment...! `
`Even if it turns out that you're the last Head of the Ushiromiya family, `
`...please let Natsuhi... `
`be the name of the wife of the final Head, `
`...your wife..." `
`...Krauss's existence was founded solely upon the trust and power of his assets as a financial fixer. `
`If either of those weakened, nothing would remain. `
`If they used the trump card of Kinzo's disappearance, they would lose one of these two essential supports. `
`......It was like offering your right arm in exchange for your neck being cut. `
`It was probably better than losing your head, but you still might die from the blood loss, `
`and even on the off-chance that you did survive, you'd have to bear a heavy wound that wouldn't heal for the rest of your life... `
`Krauss was prepared even for death... `
`Understanding this, `
`...Natsuhi buried her face in Krauss's chest... `
`and cried... `
`"......My apologies for interrupting." `
`The sudden appearance of Genji's voice made Natsuhi jump back and hurriedly wipe the tears from her eyes. `
`Krauss stood in front of Natsuhi, shielding her. `
`"Ah, Genji-san. `
`Please don't sneak up on us. `
`...Do you have some business?" `
`"......Yes. `
`My apologies, but I have something to report to Madam." `
`"To...me...? `
`Dear..." `
`"I don't mind." `
`Krauss left Natsuhi's side, went to a window a short ways off, `
`and gazed at the windy and rainy rose garden... `
`Natsuhi went with Genji to a place a short distance away. `
`"...What is it?" `
`"......Well... `
`The truth is, another phone call has come for you, Madam." `
`At that moment, a sudden, eerie sound surprised her. `
`It was the large clock in the hall announcing 24:00... `
`"You don't mean......that man...again...?" `
`"......Yes. `
`...What is to be done?" `
`"...D-Did he say what business he had with me?" `
`"......I can give you no answer on that matter. `
`He kept insisting that he wanted to speak to you directly." `
`"..............." `
`Again, ...a phone call...from the man who claimed to be taking revenge for something that happened 19 years ago. `
`19 years ago. `
`...That was just one year before Jessica and Battler were born. `
`In Natsuhi's eyes, the gap between 19 years ago and 18 years ago was immense. `
`...For a long time, she had been unable to fulfill her role of creating a successor for the Ushiromiya family...and had been treated very coldly. `
`But then, she finally gave birth to Jessica... `
`and became able to call herself the Ushiromiya Successor's wife with her head held high. `
`...So in her eyes, "Ushiromiya Natsuhi" began 18 years ago. `
`...That's why everything before that, including the events of 19 years ago, ...contained nothing but hateful memories. `
`And...something from the last year of that hateful period......is whispering vengeful words...from the other end of the phone... `
`......I can still...hear the roar of the sea... `
`............... `
`"......What is to be done?" `
`"Transfer it...to my room. `
`...Don't let my husband know." `
`"...As you wish." `
`From the very beginning, Genji had guessed that she wouldn't want Krauss hearing about this phone call. `
`That's why he had told Natsuhi covertly... `
`Natsuhi ordered that he transfer the call, told Krauss that she would turn in for the night, and left at a quick pace... `
`She returned to her room and locked the door. `
`...There was nothing peculiar about that. `
`...In the Ushiromiya family, hallways are like public roads. `
`There's no special meaning in locking the door when you enter your own room... `
`...This is what she told herself. `
`Then, as though it had been waiting for her, the telephone rang. `
`...Genji had probably transferred the call. `
`She took a deep breath, readied herself, .........and picked up the receiver. `
`"......Hello......" `
`"..............." `
`Again, ...it started with silence. `
`She realized that the person at the other end was trying to irritate her and make her feel uncomfortable, and she got angry... `
`"Why are you silent...?! `
`I'm hanging up...!" `
`"...Hahahahahahaha... `
`...Do not hang up, Mother. `
`I want to hear your voice a little longer..." `
`Again, ...that unpleasant voice... `
`"Are you trying to mock me...?! `
`Tell me what you want...!" `
`"I want to play with you, Mother." `
`"...Wh-What? `
`What are you talking about?! `
`I have no desire to play with you...!!" `
`"...You are tired from the family conference, right? `
`Is that chronic headache of yours getting to be a pain...?" `
`"Th-That's none of your business...!" `
`Just the fact that he knew her headache was troubling her made a shiver run up her spine... `
`"You get headaches because your head is all stiff. `
`If you go straight to bed like that, you cannot expect to have good dreams." `
`"Haven't I told you that's none of your business?!! `
`I'm hanging up!!" `
`Natsuhi forcefully yelled that she was hanging up, but in actuality, she couldn't... `
`After all, being at the receiving end of a phone call was much better than the alternative. `
`...If she hung up violently, `
`...this person might then call someone else... `
`"Let us play a game to help you relax. `
`I will not take up much of your time." `
`"I-I have no intention of playing with you...!" `
`"...Your name is Natsuhi, Mother. `
`It has the kanji for a season in it. `
`Pretty nice name. `
`......However, just because your name is Natsuhi, that does not necessarily mean you like summer. `
`...Which season do you really like, Mother...?" `
`"You think I'll tell you?" `
`"If you do not, ...I will hang up. `
`......Is that all right?" `
`"...Nngg, ........." `
`It was clearly a threat. `
`...It meant that if she forced him to hang up the phone, `
`anything might happen... `
`Humiliated that she was forced to give into a threat made by a man whose name she didn't even know, she gave him the answer he wanted... `
`".........I-It's autumn." `
`"Why...?" `
`"B-Because it's an easy season to pass the time in...! `
`There's no other reason in particular. `
`Are you satisfied now?!" `
`"Yeah, I am satisfied. `
`...So, it looks like your favorite season really is the same as mine. `
`......I like autumn too. `
`......Heheheheheheheheheheheheh..." `
`"...Liar! `
`You just made that up...!" `
`Surely, this man would've done the same thing no matter which season I said I liked. `
`...What is he after?! `
`What's so fun about making me uncomfortable like this...?! `
`"It is not nice to call someone a liar. `
`......I am not making it up. `
`I already knew you liked autumn, Mother. `
`......There is even proof." `
`"Proof......?" `
`"Yeah. `
`...Is there a clock in your room, Mother...?" `
`"...A clock...? `
`...Y-Yes, there is, but what's your point...?" `
`In Natsuhi's room, there was a beautiful antique clock with an intricate design. `
`...Krauss had bought it for her as a birthday present long ago. `
`"......It's 0:07 right now. `
`I'm tired, so please get this farce over with quickly...!" `
`"Try lifting the clock up." `
`"Wh-Why?" `
`"......You really do not know when to shut up. `
`Stop resisting every single time I say something. `
`Just shut up and do what I say." `
`The tone of the man's voice suddenly went low, turning into a threat. `
`It made his displeasure clear. `
`At first, this man seemed to have a calm way of speaking, but on the inside, that wasn't the case at all. `
`If she enraged this man even a little more, he would surely show his true nature right away... `
`"...Are you really that eager to make me hang up? `
`Things are best when I talk on the phone with you... `
`...I could tell your husband and daughter about what happened 19 years ago any time I want to..." `
`"I-I don't know what you're talking about, but please don't get my husband and daughter involved...! `
`I'm listening to everything you say...!" `
`"Then just do what you are told..." `
`Once again, the man threatened her in a low voice, as though warning her not to interrupt again... `
`My head was filled with the pain from my headache, the sound of my beating heart, ...and the roar of the sea... `
`...I can't disobey him anymore. `
`......As the man had ordered, I lifted up the antique clock... `
`"..................?" `
`There lay what appeared to be a single playing card. `
`.........? `
`Is it the warranty for the clock......? `
`Thinking this, she took it and turned it over......... `
`"Are you......wide awake now?" `
`"Eek, ah, `
`...aaaaaaaahhhhh... `
`Wh- `
`Wh-Wh- `
`Why... `
`...why is... `
`...this here...?!?!" `
`"Well, it would please me if your headache's gone down a bit. `
`...Tell me that you are happy, Mother." `
`"How did you...?! `
`Why?! `
`How?!" `
`"I want to hear you say you are happy, murderer. `
`How dare you act like a normal, neat-freak mother. You make me want to vomit. `
`Do you want that to land on your husband and daughter as well? `
`You don't, right? `
`You want me to keep quiet, don't you? `
`Okay, I'll keep quiet. Come on, aren't you happy? `
`Aren't you?!" `
`"Ah, ...gaaaah, I'm happy...I'm happy...!! `
`So please, ...stop... `
`Don't bring my husband and daughter into this...! `
`What is it you want? `
`Money? `
`How much?!" `
`"I do not want money. `
`......My wounds could not be healed with any amount of money. `
`But there is a medicine. `
`...That is right. `
`It is like a kind of ointment. `
`...Thick, syrupy and dribbling. `
`......And that is... `
`my hatred... `
`...my resentment towards you. `
`...Slathering myself with that... `
`is the only way to hold back the pain..." `
`Natsuhi had never had anything so hateful said to her in her entire life. `
`So she suspected many times that she must be having some sort of bad dream. `
`However, ...this definitely wasn't a dream... `
`"...Y- `
`You couldn't possibly be... `
`...on this island right now, are you...?" `
`"I am. `
`Did I not promise you? `
`I said I would be at the family conference." `
`"That's impossible...! `
`There's no way you could have come during this typhoon...!!" `
`"That would be no problem if I came before the typhoon reached here. `
`...And I am pretty sure this guest called Erika or whatever arrived even during the typhoon." `
`Her blood froze... `
`Furudo Erika had supposedly been brought here by coincidence... `
`If he knew that name, he would have to be very close by... `
`"Wh- `
`Where... `
`...a- `
`are you......?" `
`"...I will not appear in front of anyone until you introduce me. `
`Do not worry. `
`.........Oh yes, it is useless to try and search for me. `
`Your mansion is huge, `
`and you have no shortage of phones I could be calling from. `
`Besides, I am sure you do not want to meet me, right? `
`...Or else, do you want to expose me and introduce me to everyone...? `
`Introduce me to Jessica too. `
`...Tell her I am her older brother by one year. `
`Heheheheheheheheheheheheheheh!!" `
`"S-Stop it, ...stay away from Jessica..." `
`"I guess I have scared you a bit too much. `
`That is all from me...for tonight. `
`...But do not forget. `
`You cannot disobey me. `
`Understand, `
`...Mother?" `
`"......Y-Yes......" `
`"I am going to hang up for the night, ...but I have an order that must be followed until tomorrow morning." `
`"...Wh-What is it......?!" `
`"You may no longer leave that room tonight, and you may not make a phone call to anywhere. `
`If a phone call comes for you, you are not allowed to take it. `
`You will turn the lights off right now, get in bed, and sleep. `
`Then you will wake up at your ordinary time. `
`.........Heheheheheh. `
`It sure is nice to live a healthy life. `
`I really am such a good son, working so hard for the sake of my Mother's body..." `
`"...I-I understand. `
`I'll go to sleep right now. `
`I won't leave my room, and I won't pick up the phone...! `
`So, don't involve my husband and daughter...!" `
`"As long as you follow my orders, I will keep your secret, Mother. `
`...Do not disobey me. `
`...I am already very close by to you. `
`I can easily tell whether you have turned your lights off, or whether you are on the phone. `
`...If I wished to, I could even kiss your sleeping face." `
`"I'll keep it! `
`I'll keep my promise!! `
`So stop it, just stop it! `
`Stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiiittt!!" `
`...As she screamed, Natsuhi took the card she had found under the clock and crushed it up into a little ball. `
`It had a pattern on it like a tarot card, `
`...and also... `
`"{p:0:秋}", the kanji for autumn...... `
`Let's step back in time once again. `
`Right now, it is the exact moment that the large clock in the hall announced 24:00. `
`Wondering who the person who knocked twice was, `
`...the relatives in the dining hall stared at the door. `
`Rudolf told them to come in. `
`...But there was no answer. `
`Until the end of that long tone marking the arrival of 24:00, which had come from the large clock in the hall shortly after the knock, `
`they were unable to move in the slightest... `
`"...Maybe their hands are full and they can't open it..." `
`"Maybe. `
`...But it's a bit creepy that they won't say their name." `
`"...Should I open it?" `
`"Do so." `
`Kanon nodded back, then slowly opened the door... `
`"Ah, ...what's that...?!" `
`"...It's...one of Father's envelopes?" `
`Right behind the opened door, on the floor of the hallway, `
`...lay the envelope. `
`"There's no one in the hallway. `
`Perhaps they placed this here and left..." `
`The adults flew out into the corridor as well, `
`but they could find no trace of anyone who might have knocked on the door... `
`Just about an hour ago, Shannon and Kanon had come in to serve tea. `
`At that time, everyone had seen that nothing lay in that spot. `
`Someone came, knocked, left an envelope with the mark of the One-Winged Eagle on it, and left... `
`"...C-Could it have been...the Master...?!" `
`"...It's not unthinkable. `
`...Father's pretty much the only person in this mansion who would refuse to answer when asked who he was." `
`"That's not possible. `
`If that were the case, why wouldn't Father come in here openly?" `
`"...That's right. `
`Father'd probably just barge in here without knockin'... `
`The doors and windows of this mansion are locked now, right...? `
`In that case, the only people who coulda conceivably left the letter there are Krauss-san, Natsuhi-san, and Genji-san." `
`By this point, the mansion had been completely locked up. `
`Therefore, the cousins in the guesthouse, Nanjo, Gohda, Kumasawa, and Erika could not have come here. `
`Furthermore, since Krauss, Natsuhi, and Genji were the only three who weren't in this room, `
`one of those three had to have been the one who set that letter down in the corridor. `
`So, it was very likely that Krauss and the others had placed the letter there, to make it seem like a message from Kinzo... `
`"I see... `
`It'll have something written on it that's supposedly in Father's name, saying that he won't accept Battler as the Successor, or something of the sort. `
`Ridiculous. `
`I can't believe you'd try to pull such a childish trick, Nii-san...!" `
`"Well, it's not like I give a damn about being the Successor..." `
`"Give it up. `
`That's just your fate. `
`...Anyway, why don't we read what's inside?" `
`Rudolf set the letter on the dining hall table and let everyone see the front and back, to show that there were no tricks or hidden mechanisms, `
`almost like a magician does before performing his act. `
`"...Can we be sure this envelope is one of Father's?" `
`"Y-Yeah, no doubt about it. `
`Father liked to use this kind of envelope for handwritten letters... `
`What do you think, Shannon-chan?" `
`"Y-Yes... `
`...To my eyes as well, ...it looks like the type of envelope that the Master uses..." `
`"That doesn't mean Father was the one who wrote it. `
`It would be pitifully easy for Nii-san to snatch one of these from a drawer in Father's study...!" `
`"Even Krauss-sama would not be able to enter the study easily... `
`It might be hard for him to steal an envelope..." `
`"Let's try opening it. `
`We can worry about all that later. `
`...Feels like there's something in it. `
`I wonder what." `
`Rudolf opened the envelope a bit roughly. `
`Then, a folded letter... `
`...and a glittering object fell out. `
`...It was a ring. `
`"Huh? `
`......Wait a second, ...isn't that ring...?!" `
`Eva noticed it immediately and grabbed at it... `
`"Th- `
`This is... `
`...Father's ring, isn't it...?! `
`I-It's the Head's Ring!!" `
`"...Wh-What in the...!! `
`Seriously?!" `
`"Are you sure it's Father's...? `
`Could it be a replica...?" `
`"No, this is the real thing! `
`I've always dreamed about wearing this ring on my finger someday. `
`Even though Father wore this on his finger, I know more about it than anyone else. `
`...This is Father's ring, no doubt about it! `
`Why is it here?!" `
`"Does that mean it really was Father who wrote this letter...?!" `
`"...H-Heheheheh. `
`The sender isn't Father. `
`...It's much more interesting than that." `
`"Then, ...who is the letter from?" `
`"The Ushiromiya family alchemist! `
`......It's from the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}-sama...!!" `
`Rudolf showed everyone the part of the letter where that was written. `
`It really did say that... `
`"...I-It's from {f:5:Beatrice}...?!" `
`"What's it say...?" `
`"I'll read it. `
`......<Congratulations>... `
`I acknowledge that Battler-sama spectacularly solved the epitaph's riddle and reached the Golden Land. `
`......All of the gold belongs to Battler-sama. `
`Furthermore, Battler-sama is the new Head of the Ushiromiya family. `
`...As proof, .........I send the Head's Ring, ...which Kinzo-sama left in my charge... `
`...Battler-sama, I beg that you take the ring, become the new master of the gold, and guide the Ushiromiya family. `
`...I sincerely pray that you flourish as the new Head........." `
`"...Hah, ...hahah! `
`What the hell...! `
`I see, Dad just won't come out of his study, so {f:5:Beatrice}, the witch of the forest, has acknowledged Battler directly...! `
`Hahaha, hahahahahahahahaha!" `
`"...Battler-kun, `
`you take that ring. `
`...This is a special ring to be worn by the Family Head. `
`......I don't know who this {f:5:Beatrice} is, `
`but she's watched the whole thing and sent you this ring after acknowledging you as the true Successor." `
`"I-Is that okay...? `
`It's such an important ring..." `
`"Yeah, it's fine. `
`You should wear it proudly on your finger. `
`...Got it? Even if Aniki and Natsuhi nee-san tell you to take it off, you'd better not do it...!" `
`All of the relatives, with creepy smiles on their faces, urged Battler to put the ring on his finger... `
`It looked like things would get pretty nasty if he refused, so Battler reluctantly decided to put it on the middle finger of his left hand... `
`The ring was heavy and stiff... `
`At that moment, Krauss returned. `
`......Genji came back as well shortly behind him. `
`"My apologies. `
`It seems my wife is not at her best, so she's gone to bed early. `
`......Did something happen? `
`You all seem incredibly flustered." `
`".........Battler-sama, ...isn't that......" `
`Immediately, Genji keenly spotted that which Battler had just put on his finger... `
`"Your eyesight's pretty good, Genji-san! `
`...Looks like you know whose ring this is." `
`"What...? `
`What are you talking about......?" `
`Judging by Krauss's dubious expression, it seemed unlikely that he was the one who placed the letter there... `
`Furthermore, that expression quickly changed into one of shock. `
`"Heheheheh!! `
`That's right, it's the Ushiromiya Family Head's Ring!! `
`The family conference took up this new topic, `
`...and the storm came once again...... `
`The rain was still pouring down as hard as ever. `
`...This weather was supposed to continue all day tomorrow as well, which made me feel a bit depressed. `
`......Oh wait... Given the time, I should say today, not tomorrow... `
`But that doesn't really matter now. `
`......I'm sleepy... `
`With half-asleep eyes, I opened my umbrella. `
`The large drops of rain pounded mercilessly against it...... `
`Technically, the end of the family conference had been declared at 1:00 AM, `
`but external scuffles kept continuing sluggishly. `
`I'm really jealous of Aunt Rosa, who managed to slip out of there at that time. `
`She cleverly got away by saying that she'd check on Maria, who might have been staying up too late. `
`Dad caught me, ruining my chance to escape, `
`...and they made me stick around until now, 3:00 AM... `
`So, what have they decided on after all this time...? `
`Nothing at all. `
`...They just kept on arguing about who said what, like elementary school kids. `
`...I'm sure they're tired too. `
`That's probably why they keep dragging on with the same pointless questions. `
`I no longer felt any shock or anger towards them. `
`I guess drowsiness is the best painkiller... `
`...I left them behind and finally returned to the guesthouse. `
`When I got back to the guesthouse, the first floor lounge was lit. `
`I could even hear people chatting inside... `
`Apparently, some people were still awake even this late. `
`Despite the late hour, Gohda-san and Doctor Nanjo were still up and chatting. `
`Plates and cups were lined up on the counter, `
`and it looked almost like a bar with Gohda-san as the bartender. `
`When they noticed I had returned, they seemed to finally realize how late it was. `
`When Gohda-san made to top off Doctor Nanjo's glass, the latter declined with an exaggerated gesture. `
`"That's enough, that's enough. `
`...It's already too late to be up." `
`"Look how late it's gotten... `
`You were such a good person to chat with, I hardly noticed." `
`"If so, it's all thanks to your liquor. `
`We'll have to do this again sometime." `
`"Yes, gladly! `
`Battler-sama, welcome back. `
`Is the discussion with Krauss-sama and the others still continuing?" `
`"...From the way things were going, it looks like they might plod on until dawn. `
`None of my business..." `
`I spoke carelessly, with a big yawn. `
`"......They have quite a lot of stamina. `
`I'm surprised." `
`"Oh, ...so you're here too..." `
`"...With one thing and another, they ended up having a small night party here, `
`and they let me join in. `
`......Don't worry, I haven't said a word about *that*." `
`".................." `
`Erika could be seen on the sofa. `
`She had taken her shoes off and was lounging around as though she owned the place. `
`"Erika-sama is very knowledgeable on a variety of subjects. `
`I enjoyed listening to her immensely." `
`"Your knowledge truly is extensive. `
`Very impressive for one so young..." `
`"......You're very welcome. `
`I, Furudo Erika, know quite a bit about trifles such as this." `
`Erika grabbed the corners of her skirt and posed. `
`This was somewhat less than graceful considering that she was lounging on the sofa with her feet up. `
`"...Where's Aunt Rosa?" `
`"She returned at 1:00 AM, but she went straight upstairs to sleep." `
`That's probably true... `
`After taking part in that conference for so long... `
`I feel like flopping down in bed right away myself. `
`...I've had it. `
`I'm tired enough that I might flop over right here... `
`"......Well then, let's call it a night. `
`Don't you have to get up early tomorrow morning to make breakfast, Gohda-san?" `
`"Preparations for breakfast have already been made. `
`I would be most pleased if you look forward to it." `
`In Gohda-san's eyes, the family conference is an open stage on which to display his culinary skills. `
`Maybe this invigorates him so much that he doesn't even get sleepy. `
`Erika stood up, laughing at how youthful Gohda was. `
`This became a sign that it was time to disperse. `
`"I will clean up here. `
`Please, go and sleep, everyone." `
`Leaving the clean-up to Gohda-san, I went to the bathroom and then climbed the stairs to the second floor. `
`"Goodnight, everyone. `
`These old bones have stayed up a little too late." `
`"......Good night, Doctor Nanjo. `
`Good night, Battler-san." `
`"Yeah. `
`......G'night..." `
`Then, in the second floor hallway, we split up. `
`Doctor Nanjo went to his own room. `
`Erika went to her room. `
`And I...returned to the cousin room. `
`I couldn't hear any sounds of playing coming from our room. `
`...Could they have fallen asleep already? `
`No surprise, at this time of night. `
`If they were still playing, they would've been staying up way too late... `
`When I opened the door quietly, `
`as expected, the room was already pitch black except for a small nightlight. `
`Everyone was already sleeping in their beds. `
`I'm sure they all had a great time and played a ton. `
`...Then they probably talked about youthful things and enjoyed staying up late. `
`...If only I hadn't found the gold, I could've enjoyed my time with them... `
`I'm already... `
`tired, `
`...so tired. `
`Forgetting even to change my clothes or brush my teeth, `
`I crawled into bed... `
`...and immediately began to descend into the marshes of sleep...... `
`Aaah, ...today's been so insane... `
`I wonder if that old bastard is still in that family conference now... `
`...How does he not get tired.........? `
`Come to think of it, `
`...what was it that old bastard said when we parted company...? `
`'Tomorrow, there's something important I want to talk about, as a family. `
`It's about you.' `
`...I'm sure it's more stuff about being the Successor. `
`...I don't even want to hear about it... `
`'If I tell you about this, `
`...I'll probably be killed.' `
`I'll kill you whenever you want, you old bastard... `
`And then, ...what was it he said next...? `
`"It's about your birth." `
`My... `
`...birth...? `
`...Probably just something about the noble Ushiromiya lineage... `
`Not interested... `
`......Just let me... `
`...sleep...... `
