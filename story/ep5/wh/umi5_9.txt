`...The sound of crashing waves. `
`The sound of the tide surging. `
`The noise of the sea breeze. `
`Whenever my headache torments me, these are the sounds that fill my head... `
`Unable to bear a successor, I was in a very difficult position with regards to the Ushiromiya family... `
`Whenever I heard of a drug or incense that could make you achieve pregnancy, I tried it, `
`...but nothing had any effect. `
`Until I was blessed with Jessica 18 years ago, `
`...I was ashamed to even call myself a wife. `
`"...Children are created by the efforts of two people and the whims of heaven. `
`It's not fair to place all the blame on yourself." `
`"I still don't know what caused my inability to become pregnant. `
`I even went to see noted physicians. `
`I underwent humiliating examinations. `
`...But I was always just told that they didn't understand the reason..." `
`"Even though quite some time had passed since your marriage, you still couldn't bear a child. `
`...I see. `
`It's only natural that Eva, who secretly aspired to become the Successor, would start getting ideas..." `
`Eva tried to convince Father that I was a failure as the Successor's wife. `
`It was a time when Kinzo was also very disappointed by my husband's repeated business failures. `
`On the other hand, Eva's husband Hideyoshi's business was growing well, completely the opposite of my husband's. `
`...He was the only person who could bring Father good news. `
`So, perhaps Father couldn't be blamed if he decided to lend an ear to Eva's words, `
`...or even accept them completely. `
`It was all my fault, ...because I couldn't bear a child... `
`"You are sinless. `
`Aren't babies of this country carried here by storks? `
`If anyone is to be judged, blame the stork." `
`".........Thank you. `
`However, ...even though he was still in good health then, the Head was already well past his prime, `
`and it's not hard to imagine that he wanted to see his grandchildren's faces as soon as possible..." `
`"Who cares. `
`If he wanted a grandchild, he could've just done what he wanted with that appalling amount of money he had. `
`...This is Kinzo, the man who always bragged about how money could create anything. `
`If he wanted a grandchild, why couldn't he just manage something with that money he was so proud of...?!" `
`"............Yes, ...that's right. `
`...The Head...gave up on me when I couldn't bear a child... `
`and did just that." `
`...The Head gave to many charities, thinking it the duty of anyone in possession of so much money. `
`One among these, an orphanage known as the "{ruby:Gospel:Fukuin} House", had been given especially large donations, possibly because he had old ties with that place. `
`"Ah, the Fukuin House. `
`...Furniture came from that place quite often." `
`"To provide on-the-job training and preparation for life as a working adult, `
`the Head employed Fukuin House children with exceptional grades as servants. `
`...All of the servants in the mansion with "{ruby:on:{p:0:音}}" in their names, `
`such as Shannon, Kanon, Lunon, Manon and Leion, came from there." `
`"...There were quite a lot of them, weren't there...? `
`Though most quit after just a few years." `
`"That's probably because a few years of wages from working here would earn them more than enough to live on their own. `
`...Experience as a servant for the Ushiromiya family would be a wonderful thing to add to their resume. `
`I'm sure it was the Head's ambition that they would gain this for themselves and then spread their wings in society." `
`".........I see. `
`...So, an adopted child......" `
`"..............." `
`"F-Father, `
`...what...did you just say...?" `
`"Accept this baby as my grandchild." `
`"Ohhh, ...there, there. `
`There, there..." `
`Apparently, the baby that Kumasawa was trying to soothe didn't like the study air at all. `
`...It kept on crying, upset... `
`"M-My apologies, Father... `
`...What is it you just..." `
`"Accept this baby as my grandchild. `
`And raise it to be the one who succeeds Krauss." `
`"...In other words, ...you want me to raise this baby...as me and my husband's own child...?" `
`"That's right. `
`It's clear now that you cannot bear children. `
`...There must be some sort of defect in your body." `
`"Ooh, ...there, there. `
`Ooh, there, there..." `
`As though she couldn't hear our discussion in the slightest, Kumasawa kept on trying to cuddle the baby. `
`This made it cry even louder... `
`"......What nonsense. `
`If all responsibility of giving birth to children rested with the woman, there'd be no need for men in this world." `
`"I've never forgotten the bitter pain I felt that day... `
`...It's not as though I didn't want a child... `
`...However, no matter how much I prayed, I couldn't get pregnant... `
`Thinking that something to do with my body might be the cause, I went to see several famous doctors. `
`But even so, no matter how hard I tried, ...I couldn't become pregnant..." `
`"And in the end, ...this was the result. `
`.........I see." `
`The baby had been picked up by the Fukuin House just recently. `
`Of course, you couldn't help but feel compassion for this child, `
`who was so young and who had already lost its parents' affection. `
`However, ......it brought me nothing but pain and sadness. `
`It would have been another story if I had suffered to bear this child, `
`...but why `
`should I be forced to hold this baby, `
`...who not only shared none of my blood, `
`but who was not related to my husband in the slightest either...? `
`"I don't hate Father. `
`...If anything, ...I hated my own body...! `
`I detested it! `
`I truly detested my own body for being unable to bear a child...!! `
`So I prayed. `
`I prayed to both angels and demons!! `
`And my wishes were granted by both...!" `
`"...For what did you pray to angels?" `
`"I prayed for a miracle in my body...! `
`If there was something wrong with my body, I could accept that. `
`In that case, I wanted to overcome that defect and somehow be granted the miracle of being given my husband's child...!" `
`"...That wish was granted. `
`...The next year, you gave birth to Jessica." `
`"And, ...for what did you pray to demons?" `
`"I couldn't stand it, `
`...I couldn't stand it... `
`I hated my body...! `
`So, I hated this baby, `
`...because it made my failure so apparent...!!" `
`"......What...did you wish for?" `
`"For the first time, I prayed and made wishes to demons...!! `
`I wished that this baby would just disappear!!" `
`...Of course, that wish was also granted...by demons. `
`On that day, I left the baby with an older servant and went to think about the future in the rose garden. `
`No, that's a lie. `
`...I didn't want to think about anything. `
`The baby's cries were annoying, `
`so I ordered the servant to take the baby to a place where I couldn't hear. `
`...By a place where I couldn't hear, I meant somewhere far away. `
`Yes, I wished for it. `
`...I wished for the servant to take the baby far away and never return...!! `
`"I see... `
`...So, a passing demon heard your wish, Natsuhi-sama." `
`"And then, ...what happened next?" `
`"After that, ...there was a bizarre accident that could only have been granted me by a demon..." `
`The woodland path from the rose garden to the harbor is probably well-suited for a comfortable walk. `
`...It must surely feel good to occasionally leave the path and walk through a grove of trees, depending on your mood. `
`However, ......wouldn't that path be fairly hard to travel on when taking a walk with a baby in your arms...? `
`"There was a cliff on the other side. `
`It was...about ten meters tall, I think. `
`It was rocky below. `
`...There was also a fence there! `
`Does it seem at all likely that the servant went to the trouble of walking there holding a baby... `
`and then leaned against the fence...? `
`The only conceivable explanation is that she was lured there by the beckoning of a demon!!" `
`".........She {i:was} lured there, wasn't she? `
`...By a demon who heard your wish..." `
`"And then, ...the servant and the baby..." `
`"They died...!! `
`They fell from the cliff, down to the rocks below...! `
`No, they died because I wished it! `
`That means this is-" `
`"It isn't your fault! `
`There's no need to think about it any further." `
`"But it happened because I wished it...!!" `
`"No, that's wrong! `
`Even if you wish for something, whether it comes true or not is decided by the whims of gods, demons, and witches! `
`You are sinless. `
`Humans are sinless. `
`You can even say that I killed them. `
`No, I did kill them! `
`I saw your mourning and felt pity, so I lured the servant with the baby to the cliff and guided them down it!" `
`"Wasn't it just an unfortunate accident? `
`If you can't accept it as an accident, blame it on us. `
`That's why demons exist." `
`"......That's right. `
`We're here for your sake. `
`...It's not like you killed them. `
`We killed them. `
`So you are sinless. `
`...So please, don't blame yourself, Natsuhi." `
`"Is that true...? `
`Am I truly sinless...?!" `
`"Yeah, you are. `
`Fuhhahahahaha!! `
`Young one who claims revenge for the events of 19 years ago, `
`if you're going to curse someone, curse me. `
`However, witches have a patent on curses...! `
`Let me take on this fight you're trying to pick with Natsuhi!!" `
`{e:090:I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, {f:5:Beatrice} the Golden}! `
`{e:090:If anyone picks a fight with the master I serve, I will fight in my master's stead}! `
`{e:090:Revenge for 19 years ago, you say}? `
`{e:090:I'll make you learn that's not even a blink of an eye for a witch who's lived a thousand years}!! `
`{e:090:Gahahahahahaahahahahahahahaha}!! `
`{e:090:So, you hate Natsuhi for wishing your death 19 years ago}?! `
`{e:090:Let me make you remember just who it was that lured you off that cliff}...!! `
`...As the middle-aged female servant cuddled the sobbing baby, she walked on a small path through the trees... `
`Natsuhi had told her that the baby was too loud, so she had tried to get as far from the rose garden as she could. `
`...She was completely unaware as to why she'd gone out of her way to head in this direction. `
`However, the sobbing baby... `
`...suddenly stopped crying. `
`Something was reflected in its eyes, but the servant couldn't tell what. `
`However, thinking that the baby had stopped because it had taken an interest in something, `
`...she headed in the direction of the baby's gaze... `
`The baby had seen...a cloud of gold butterflies disappearing off into the trees. `
`And, ......on the other side of the trees, ...the servant could see a woman. `
`......Who? `
`She didn't recognize this person, but it didn't look like anyone who was supposed to be here. `
`The baby stopped crying and stared in that direction. `
`...Then, the servant's legs started to automatically carry her that way... `
`"Come this way, woman. `
`......Bring that cursed baby with you." `
`"............Ah..." `
`The woman couldn't disobey. `
`...She was completely overwhelmed by Beato's gold-glowing eyes... `
`She walked lightly, as though through a dream world. `
`...At some point, the scenery surrounding her had changed, `
`...but she did not notice. `
`She could not notice... `
`Though this should have been Rokkenjima, `
`...at some point, it had become the garden of a mansion she had never seen before. `
`It was a garden she had never set eyes on, even grander than the great rose garden of the Ushiromiya family, ...a garden of gold roses. `
`There stood an arbor, `
`...and a woman wearing an elegant dress beckoning to her...... `
`...There was a man who looked like a butler, and the tea he poured with a beautiful gesture had a very nice and enticing smell. `
`It was as though they were telling her to join their tea party... `
`She couldn't disobey. `
`......She had to go to the master of this golden rose garden... `
`...and give this child as an offering... `
`"Forgive me, woman. `
`Curse your bad luck for being entranced by a witch. `
`...And, surrounded by these gold roses, which you would never be able to enjoy in this world, sleep. `
`......Gaap." `
`"......Yes, understood." `
`When Gaap snapped her fingers, `
`...a pitch-black hole opened at the woman's feet, and she was swallowed up along with the baby. `
`The scene of the moment that followed must've burned itself into the eyes of the woman and the baby. `
`The two floated in the air...and looked down at the gold rose garden spread out below them. `
`Below their feet was not the earth, but a golden rose garden that stretched as far as the eye could see, without any gaps. `
`If one could have this scene imprinted in their minds as their last memory, that would be such a merciful way to die... `
`Then, the woman and the baby were swallowed up by the golden sea. `
`The *thunk* was remarkably plain, and remarkably quiet for a sound that stole away two lives. `
`...However, it made for a perfectly suitable show at a tea party of witches. `
`With the woman and the baby at the center, ...the rose garden was slowly swallowed up by darkness... `
`The sound of the wind grew stronger bit by bit. `
`...Is that TV static? `
`What is that noise...? `
`...It was the roar of the sea. `
`The two who had fallen into the thicket of golden roses from that great height and died... `
`...were gradually wrapped up in the roar of the sea, wrapped up in the scenery of the beach below the cliff... `
`"I guarantee it. `
`You are completely sinless!! `
`I'll accept this revenge from 19 years ago!! `
`Wahhahahahahahahahahaha!!" `
`"...Ee, ...eeeeeeeeeeeeekkk......!" `
`When I spotted the two of them on the rocks below, ...I went pale. `
`Then, I dashed back to the mansion, ...and there was a huge uproar. `
`They took them to a hospital in a boat as soon as possible, ......but from that height, it was a miracle that they had even avoided an instant death. `
`Both the servant... `
`...and the baby... `
`......died. `
`In less than three days from the time Father had entrusted me with the baby, ......I had killed it...! `
`My husband had been on a business trip. `
`Rosa-san, who had still lived on the island at the time, had been traveling with her friends. `
`......Father and I were the only ones on Rokkenjima!! `
`And before anyone except Father and I really knew anything, `
`......a baby had appeared out of nowhere...and then disappeared again!! `
`That's right, it was a dream...a nightmare!! `
`I was sure that Father would blame me. `
`...However, he seemed somehow strange...! `
`"Heh, ......heheheheheheheh, fwahahahahahahahahahahahhahhahaha!! `
`I saw this coming, I knew this would happen! `
`How long will you struggle? `
`How long will it be before you're mine?!! `
`Wahahahahaahahahahahaha!! `
`I have no interest in an empty cage! `
`Throw it away!!" `
`When Father learned of the accidental death, `
`he kept on laughing and laughing, as though there could be no greater pleasure, enough that just listening to it gave me a creepy feeling. `
`Perhaps something had come loose in his mind...... `
`From that day onwards... `
`Father shut himself up inside the world of the occult even more than he ever had before...... `
`When my husband came back, he was surprised to see that Father was even more bizarre than he had been before. `
`However, ......he had already accepted that this would happen sooner or later. `
`Of course, my husband had heard about the baby. `
`However, he told me that it was surely just some whim of Father's, and to forget it. `
`So I forgot it! `
`It was an unfortunate accident. `
`No, there wasn't an accident at all! `
`I forgot everything, even that the baby had existed in the first place...!! `
`After all, it was a twisted nightmare that lasted not even three days! `
`That's right, it was all a nightmare...!! `
`I don't want to remember!! `
`The cliff, the broken fence, the roar of the sea, `
`and...the cry of the baby......!!! `
`"So, this baby......is the baby from 19 years ago?" `
`"Of course not! `
`I killed that baby! `
`It no longer exists in this world!" `
`"...However, there is no red truth in the Human world. `
`Nothing can be trusted there." `
`"......That's right. `
`Beato definitely killed that baby. `
`However, you might find out that it's alive in the world of Humans. `
`...Whether {i:it's really alive or not}, right?" `
`"Do you mean to say......that it actually survived?! `
`After falling to the rocks from that height...?!" `
`"I don't know. `
`But calm down. `
`...No matter how much this person hates you, it was an accident, and that's the truth. `
`If he does hate you, his hatred is completely unjustified...!" `
`"But, but...! `
`Even if I didn't lay a finger on him, ...inside my heart, I...!!" `
`"Calm down. `
`...No matter who the man from 19 years ago hates or what he yells at you, there's no way the sin he's after actually occurred. `
`So calm down. `
`Why don't I welcome the man from 19 years ago as my guest? `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"Just when the riddle was solved and I thought my job was finished... `
`I've got to entertain this final guest of mine!! `
`Kuhhyahyayhahyahya!!" `
`"This begins to grow more interesting. `
`...Not only are you protecting Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}'s secret, but you also have a 19th guest, as well as a man from 19 years ago." `
`"......True, since we claim that Kinzo is alive, Erika is the 19th person. `
`And besides that 19th person, we also have a man from 19 years ago? `
`How interesting. I'm getting all fired up." `
`"We have no lack of opponents!! `
`And I was just lamenting the fact that I had but one guest at my tea party!! `
`Come, you fools!! `
`Kuhhahahahaahahahahahahaahahah!!" `
`Furudo Erika is Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}'s piece. `
`In that case, whose piece is the man from 19 years ago...? `
`The voice faintly seeping from the other end of the line...was Natsuhi's. `
`"...I-I understand. `
`I'll go to sleep right now. `
`I won't leave my room, and I won't pick up the phone...! `
`So, don't involve my husband and daughter...!" `
`Even this begging scream, which would shake the heart of any listener, `
`...could be listened to with a cold ruthlessness through the end of the receiver... `
`"As long as you follow my orders, I will keep your secret, Mother. `
`...Do not disobey me. `
`...I am already very close by to you. `
`I can easily tell whether you have turned your lights off, or whether you are on the phone. `
`...If I wished to, I could even kiss your sleeping face." `
`"I'll keep it! `
`I'll keep my promise!! `
`So stop it, just stop it! `
`Stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiiittt!!" `
`The receiver was slammed down. `
`..."He" knew very well that the way you hang up a phone can leave a nasty aftertaste for the other side... `
`"Okay, goodnight, Mother. `
`.........And there you have it. `
`Now Natsuhi won't come out of her room tonight." `
`"......That's pretty handy. `
`You can change your voice?" `
`"*giggle*! `
`Anyone can change their voice. `
`A sweet voice when coaxing Papa{p:0:♪} `
`A sick-sounding voice when taking the day off school. `
`An apologetic voice when turning down a friend that you actually hate! `
`{f:5:If you want}{p:0:♪}, `
`{p:0:I can do~} `
`{p:0:{nobr:ａｎｙ} {nobr:ｖｏｉｃｅ☆}} `
`at all~!" `
`"......You should stop being a witch and become a voice actress." `
`"Heheheheheheheh! `
`So, are all the pieces set up on both sides now? `
`......"Furudo Erika". `
`What a wonderful piece. `
`She's a much more suitable piece for you than Ange was, Bern." `
`"......Your praise honors me, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}." `
`"The pleasure is mine. `
`...She really is wonderful. `
`Truly cute. `
`I'd like to make her surrender to the Illusion of the Witch and see her face twist in humiliation." `
`"...Hear that? `
`...Don't embarrass me, okay? `
`Prove yourself to be a much more useful piece than Ange was." `
`"Yes, leave it to me, `
`Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, my master. `
`...I'm nothing like that gloomy, dull-witted, totally uncute piece." `
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*! `
`She's right. `
`That Ange didn't do anything useful except get turned into meat chunks to egg Battler on! `
`I have absolutely no interest in family love or sibling love! `
`The game we wanna see is more gruesome and sticky! `
`A <grotesque>, <pop>, and <cute> murder case!!" `
`"......If Natsuhi is the king, then I wonder if that makes Beato the queen. `
`*giggle* `
`The pack of witches and furniture guarding Natsuhi is less like a set of chess pieces and more like-" `
`"Bowling pins, right?! `
`Kyahhahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`Natsuhi and Beato, `
`Kinzo and illusions of the worthless furniture! `
`Entertain us a bit, will ya?!" `
`"Especially you, Beato! `
`We're already bored of you! `
`This "Legend of the Witch Murders" game of yours is over already! `
`Your time is over and done with!! `
`This game board already belongs to Bern and me. `
`It'll suit you to be reduced to one of our pieces and toyed with for all eternity!!" `
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle* `
`Both Natsuhi and Beato are like the guts of a filthy truth wrapped up in a bit of thin skin. `
`...Tearing that to bits and dragging the insides out is one of my... `
`no, one of our few pleasures." `
`"Yep, you can have tons of fun with it. `
`Hey, are you watching, `
`{f:5:Beatrice}? `
`Look at how much fun can be had playing with your game board. `
`Lemme show you. `
`This 5th game's really gonna be fun!!" `
`"......It's a bit sad if we're the only ones having a pleasant chat. `
`Why don't you let Beato talk too?" `
`"Hear that? `
`I'll give you special permission to talk. `
`What do you hope to gain from this latest game?!" `
`"..............." `
`"Ahahahaha! `
`She said nothing! `
`That's right, that's right! `
`You're the loser who surrendered to Battler! `
`Leave it to me, 'kay? `
`I'll put the witch side on top right away! `
`But that means I'll have to sacrifice your piece!!" `
`"The epitaph has been easily solved before the first twilight, and {f:5:Beatrice}, the keeper of the gold, has lost face. `
`...*giggle*giggle*!!" `
`"...Isn't it great that you remain as a piece, as part of Natsuhi's illusion? `
`...Well, we're treating you as a pin now instead of a piece, okay?" `
`"The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} is out of the picture now! `
`You and your furniture have only a miniscule role in my game! A loser's role!! `
`Resign yourself to getting blasted away and becoming Bern's and my toy!!" `
`"......If you don't like that, why not just tell us to stop? `
`If you do, we'll stop." `
`"..............." `
`"She's saying she doesn't mind! `
`*giggle*giggle*!! `
`You're totally a pin!!" `
`"Ahhahaha, ahhahahahahaha " `
`kyahhhahahhah, hahahahahahhhahahahgwahyahhahaaah!!!"" `
`There's no need for a Golden Witch anymore. `
`All that's needed is a sacrificial doll, so the two witches can enjoy some time playing. `
`Die, die, disappear. `
`Confess to your filthy past and your crimes, `
`speak out your sob story of regret and repentance as you throw yourself off a cliff and die!! `
`The Golden Witch will never again have her turn...!! `
`Ahhahhahahahahaahhahhaahahahahahaahahahahahahaha...!! `
`"..............." `
`".........Beato..." `
`This will probably...turn out to be a nasty game. `
`On the surface, it looks very similar to the usual tales. `
`However, ...there's no respect given to the true main character of this story. `
`This tale...was supposed to be one that the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} invited Ushiromiya Battler to see. `
`However, the host has been lost, and there are no longer any guests. `
`...The one who did the inviting and the one who was invited...are no longer around in this horrible tale. `
`{a:c:Welcome to the fifth game: `
`{n}End of the Golden Witch. `
`{n}Welcome to a party with neither host nor guests,{nobr: hijacked by wicked witches......}} `
`"......Ready, Battler? `
`The second day is finally about to start. `
`Heheheheh! Just like Beato, I hate slow story progression!" `
`"Just do what you want. `
`...No matter how much you mess things up, I'll definitely reach the truth of this game." `
`"*giggle* `
`......It has to be that way. `
`You've got to fight for your little sister's sake as well." `
`"............" `
`"Don't worry. `
`...Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} is a far more terrifying opponent than that fool {f:5:Beatrice}, `
`but I'll be giving you plenty of support, so there won't be any problems. `
`...Together with me, why don't you finally expose the Illusion of the Witch this time?" `
`"......I don't give a damn about you. `
`I won't acknowledge anything that didn't exist in Beato's games, so I don't need you." `
`"Is now really the time to act tough? `
`......Oh well, let's both give it our all, okay? `
`Together, let's tear this Illusion of the Witch apart. `
`*giggle*giggle*!" `
`Erika offered me her hand to shake. `
`...Instead of just passively ignoring this, `
`I gave her proactive and clear answer by knocking her hand aside. `
`"......*giggle* `
`Looks like he hates shaking hands. `
`Just like Ange." `
`"Don't worry. `
`I'm a far more useful piece than Ange. `
`...I'm nothing at all like shredded meat that couldn't do anything but restore your fighting spirit." `
`"..............." `
`"*giggle*...! `
`Isn't it great that you've been blessed with such a helpful-looking ally?! `
`In the past, it was {f:5:Virgilia} and Ronove. `
`Then Ange came as well. `
`And now you have Bern and Erika! `
`There are so many pieces supporting you! `
`So, how does it feel knowing that you still can't catch on to the truth despite that? How does it feel?!" `
`"......It doesn't matter. `
`This battle is between me and Beato. `
`Everyone else besides us...doesn't matter." `
`"Oh, is that true? `
`Are you finally standing on your own?! `
`You've always had someone helping you, someone sympathetic to you, so I wonder just how far you'll get on your own! `
`Entertain me!" `
`"...I'll grab it and take it back. `
`......This is our game. `
`...You two aren't wanted here!!" `
`"*giggle* `
`Yes, that's true. `
`......This is your game. `
`So try taking it back. `
`...Let's see how far someone like you, who couldn't even win Beato's games when she went easy on you all over the place, `
`can get in Lambda's completely ruthless game without any help!" `
`"Well then, wake up!! Ushiromiya Battler!! Welcome to the morning of October 5th!!" `
