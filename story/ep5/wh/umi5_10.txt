`...Was it someone's alarm clock? `
`An electronic tone repeatedly rang out through the room... `
`Battler, who had gone to bed late and not managed to get enough sleep, `
`covered his head in his blanket and waited for someone to turn off the alarm. `
`...But no matter how much time passed, the electronic tone didn't stop. `
`......I see. `
`The point of an alarm clock isn't just to be loud enough to wake you, `
`but to be annoying enough to keep you from wanting to fall back asleep. `
`Heeey, ...the alarm's going off. `
`Make it stop please... `
`Why do waking-up voices always get this annoyed? `
`...Well, it does makes sense. `
`After all, people are still sleepy and in a bad mood. `
`However, there was absolutely no sign that my annoyed voice had caused anyone to turn over in their sleep... `
`or crawl out of bed to stop the alarm. `
`Letting out a deep sigh, I stumbled to my feet. `
`With the shutters down on the windows, there was almost no light getting in, and the room was as dim as it had been earlier. `
`Though, even without the shutters, `
`there's no way this dull weather would let in enough sun to make this a pleasant morning. `
`The cousins were still wrapped up in their beds, sound asleep and taking no notice whatsoever of that beeping. `
`Normally, once any one person gets up, the others tend to automatically follow... `
`...Annoyed that this "law of serial summer camp awakenings" that I'd made up had been broken, I searched for the source of the sound. `
`I could hear it coming from a wristwatch set on a table. `
`Judging by the style of the watch, it was probably George-aniki's. `
`Anyway, when I randomly pushed a small button on the side of it, the sound stopped. `
`Apparently, it had been set for 7:00 in the morning. `
`......Is it already 7:00? `
`Sorry, but I really don't feel like I slept at all... `
`Playing cards were left on the table as though they had stopped mid-game. `
`...The game had probably been sevens. `
`"..............." `
`Dammit, ...I've got this piercing headache. `
`What the hell happened last night? `
`...That mountain of gold and the subsequent argument between the relatives...all feel like a bad dream... `
`"......So stupid..." `
`Breakfast normally came at 8:00. `
`......Now wasn't a bad time to start getting up and getting dressed. `
`Even those adults probably won't argue in front of the cousins. `
`......In that case, I'll stay with my cousins all day long. `
`I'm sure they'll be able to separate me from all this annoying talk about the gold and being the Successor and all...... `
`In fact, I should have done this from the beginning... `
`I felt disgusting, having slept with my clothes on last night, which caused me to get all sweaty. `
`...I guess I'll take a shower. `
`I'm sure the others want to as well. `
`At this age, it's embarrassing to wake them by shaking their shoulders. `
`If I turn the TV on, everyone will probably wake up. `
`Well, let's at least turn the lights on for now. `
`...In this dim light, with the quiet sound of the never-ending wind and rain, it really doesn't feel like morning has come yet. `
`I flipped the light switch. `
`And then, that dimly lit morning ended. `
`"......George, ......Geeeooooooooorge!!!" `
`"This is just too horrible... `
`How...could anyone get away with somethin' like this...?!!" `
`As they clung to Aniki's corpse, which would never wake up again, `
`...Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi cried. `
`"...That's enough. `
`Do you think George-kun would like the two of you to see him this way...? `
`Of course not...!" `
`"......Aneki, `
`I know how you feel, but let's have Doctor Nanjo handle this..." `
`"You don't understand!! `
`George was killed! `
`George!! `
`Geoooooooooorge, ugghaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!" `
`"Doctor Nanjo's right. `
`We mustn't keep staring at George in such a state... `
`...This is for George's sake! `
`We have to restrain ourselves for now...!" `
`When Aunt Eva tried even harder to cling to that corpse, `
`Dad and Uncle Hideyoshi dragged her away and had a heated debate with her beside the wall... `
`"No, nooooooooooooo, Geooooooooorge!! `
`Doctor Nanjo! Help him!! `
`If he's lost too much blood, do a blood transfusion!! `
`George and I are the same blood type!! `
`I beg you! `
`Doctor Nanjo!!" `
`".........Eva-san, `
`...it pains me to say this, `
`...but your blood can't do George-kun any good now..." `
`Doctor Nanjo shook his head slightly, then nodded across to where I stood, giving me a signal. `
`I softly pulled the blanket up, ...covering George-aniki's corpse. `
`His neck...was split wide open. `
`...It was probably...larger and deeper than his mouth. `
`Would covering that part up make the corpse look neat and clean...? `
`Of course not... `
`...The large amount of lost blood stained the bed a horrible red and black, `
`...and even covering him with the blanket couldn't hide the traces. `
`After all, even the blanket had large, red-black stains, `
`and covering him with it made his corpse look even more gruesome... `
`So I stripped the blanket off of my bed and placed it on top of the first one. `
`...But there were only two extra blankets. `
`So if we covered one more of the corpses, ...we wouldn't be able to cover any more. `
`I feel bad about the ones we can't cover, `
`...but for some reason, ...times like these make me feel like muttering "don't complain about it being unfair" inside my head...... `
`"...Kyrie, `
`put blankets over all of them. `
`...Wouldn't want them to catch cold." `
`".........Sure." `
`Kyrie-san and I started covering the other corpses up to their heads with their blankets, just like George-aniki's... `
`...So that they wouldn't have to undergo any more shame, ...with their terrible wounds exposed like this... `
`In one bed...rested Jessica. `
`...Jessica was exactly the same as George-aniki. `
`Though she appeared to be resting quietly in the bed, `
`...her neck had been sliced deep and the wound lay open in a brutal way... `
`Maria was the same. `
`...And not only Maria. `
`There was one more victim. `
`Lying on the same bed, as though they'd been sleeping alongside each other, `
`...was Aunt Rosa. `
`George-aniki, Jessica, Maria, ...and Aunt Rosa. `
`...In this room were four humans who had been killed, their necks sliced open. `
`They'd probably been like that since last night. `
`...I'd returned without noticing anything, gotten in bed, and fallen asleep... `
`......All of them had a horizontal cut across their throats. `
`I had been...forced to see all the way...into the depths of those gashes in everyone's throats... `
`At worst, the wounds might've been deep enough to stretch halfway through their necks. `
`...If you tried to open it up, you'd probably be able to see that the gash reached all the way to the bone. `
`The only wounds were the single gashes on each neck. `
`...So if you just covered their necks with your hand, `
`...you might be able to persuade yourself that they were merely sleeping. `
`But even so, `
`...this frighteningly deep wound... `
`...was incredibly... `
`gruesome...... `
`There's no such thing as "clean" or "dirty" ways of killing. `
`...All methods of killing are equally brutal. `
`But even so, `
`......the brutality here... `
`...was just horrible......... `
`And...there was one more thing that adorned these brutal murders, making them even more unsettling. `
`Drawn very large on the wall... `
`...was something like an eerie magic circle. `
`It was drawn in a bright-red paint that looked like blood... `
`and made it look as though some creepy ceremony had taken place in this room, `
`with the four of them offered as human sacrifices... `
`However, that wasn't what we were concerned about. `
`...No one has a heart so cold that they could witness the deaths of those close to them... `
`...and still worry about some scribbles on the wall... `
`"......Good morning, everyone. `
`......Oh, ...what a wonderful magic circle." `
`The girl who bragged that she drew more pleasure from the process of exposing the truth than the truth itself... `
`...and who went so far as to call herself an intellectual rapist, ...appeared in the hall. `
`When she saw the extraordinarily creepy magic circle in this gruesome room, `
`I heard what was unmistakably a sigh of admiration escape her lips... `
`"You...... ...Don't come in here......" `
`"......I just heard about it in the corridor. `
`It's four people who've passed away, correct? `
`...Allow me to express my sincere regrets." `
`On Erika's face... `
`...no, that's not it. `
`It was in her eyes. `
`...In Erika's eyes, I could see... `
`......an indiscreet smile...... `
`...that was hard to describe. `
`She...found this interesting. `
`...She found the outbreak of a crime... `
`...interesting... `
`It was like the smile of a kid off to the side of the stage `
`just before her turn to appear in a school play... `
`"...Sorry, Erika-chan. `
`We're busy at the moment. `
`...Could you wait in your room?" `
`"......Well, we can't have that. `
`It's the detective's right to investigate the scene." `
`"We're saying that we have no business with you...! `
`Now's the time for outsiders like you to stand back!!" `
`"......In my personal opinion, `
`only third-rate mysteries have a suspect who tries to interfere with the investigation, and then turns out to be the culprit." `
`"Who gives a damn about what you want?!! `
`Get out!! `
`You aren't wanted here!!" `
`"Erika-chan...! `
`I'm really sorry, but could you go back to your room?! `
`We're busy right now!" `
`"Geooooooooooorge, `
`Geooooooooooorge, `
`waaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!" `
`"...Stand back. `
`I can't investigate the scene like this." `
`"If it's necessary, we'll do it ourselves! The police will do it! `
`Like hell you have the right to bring more shame to everyone's remains than they've already endured!!" `
`"{p:1:Detective's authority. `
`......The detective has the right to investigate all crime scenes. `
`Move out of the way, Ushiromiya Battler. `
`This is my legitimate right within the game, as granted to the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} side}." `
`Those words, which seemed to be utterly ridiculous at first, `
`...were words of power that had come from a world on a much higher plane than the one they were in. `
`Battler was thrown back by an unseen power and landed on his butt. `
`Struck silent by this quiet intensity, ...nobody was able to prevent Erika from entering the room, suffocated by this bizarre atmosphere... `
`"......Don't worry. `
`My goal is not to profane the dignity of the deceased. `
`It's not like I want to peek into something as disgusting as a slit through someone's neck. `
`...I want to know something completely different." `
`"In other words, who committed these murders. `
`...I ask Doctor Nanjo, and everyone else too. `
`......In particular, the first one to discover them, Battler-san. `
`......There are many things I want to question you about, so I request your cooperation." `
`"...L-Like I said, by what authority are you doing this...?!" `
`"{p:1:Because I am the detective}." `
`Battler couldn't argue against this incomprehensible nonsense. `
`...No, ...he wasn't permitted to argue. `
`It was a restriction...placed on pieces. `
`Erika summoned Doctor Nanjo and heard the details of his preliminary examination of the corpses. `
`...Normally, he wouldn't have spoken of that to an outsider so casually. `
`...However, for some reason, the atmosphere about the place had become one in which hiding things from Erika was forbidden... `
`"......Okay, let's enjoy this first twilight of Lambda's. `
`Four corpses? `
`That's two corpses short. `
`...Well, she doesn't necessarily need to have six people killed, but that's how we've been playing. `
`That girl isn't completely clueless, so she must've killed two more people somewhere." `
`On the wall was a magic circle representing the first twilight, similar to the ones in Beato's games. `
`*giggle* That girl talks tough, but I wonder just how closely she'll be able to imitate Beato. `
`*giggle*giggle*, ahhahahahahaha...! `
`That Hebrew sure is crappy. `
`It isn't written exactly right. `
`"...What the heck... `
`What's going on? `
`Why's there a magic circle?" `
`"I'll bet they wanted to copy {f:5:Beatrice}-sama. `
`Aha, what a crappy magic circle...!" `
`"This isn't just a copycat! `
`Some Human went out of their way to draw that...so they could make it look like {f:5:Beatrice}-sama did this...! `
`Anyway, let's report to {f:5:Beatrice}-sama about this!" `
`"Even though we're already up to our eyeballs just protecting {f:5:Goldsmith}'s secret... What a pain." `
`"But these murders have no beauty to them at all. `
`...It isn't really a closed room, and there's nothing impossible about it. `
`Such pitiful murders aren't worthy of {f:5:Beatrice}-sama at all." `
`"...Furudo Erika... `
`...An unexpected crime and an unexpected woman. `
`...And the unexpected man from 19 years ago. `
`......And if you add in the fact that Battler's already solved the epitaph, this game is completely different from normal. `
`...What the heck's going on...?! `
`Let's go!!" `
`""Yes, Onee-sama!!"" `
`In the kitchen, Gohda was preparing a wonderful breakfast at a brisk pace. `
`The main dish would be herb omelets. `
`Even simple foods could become an invigorating feast under Gohda's skillful hands. `
`He would precook everything beforehand and prepare the food in the dining hall right before everyone's eyes. `
`"Hmm hmm hmm hmm{p:0:♪} Pan pan pan pan{p:0:♪}" `
`Gohda hummed as he continued his work in high spirits. `
`When Shannon, who was helping out, saw Gohda like this, her mood also brightened. `
`She arranged the salad in a neat little pattern and showed it to Gohda. `
`"How is this? `
`I think it makes the tomato look a bit cute." `
`"Hmmmm, very nice! `
`You really know what you're doing, Shannon-san! `
`Hmm hmm hmm hmm{p:0:♪}" `
`""Hmm hmm hmm hmm{p:0:♪}"" `
`The two happy people gave each other a high five. `
`Shannon didn't like Gohda when he was sneaky, but she had no problems at all with him when he was cooking happily. `
`She sometimes even thought it'd be nice if his contract hadn't included any jobs besides cooking. `
`If that had been the case, he wouldn't have had to get in a bad mood doing unnecessary jobs. `
`"The dining hall is ready. `
`You can carry it in whenever you want." `
`"We're almost good to go, so please get the serving cart ready. `
`Hmm hmm hmmmmm!" `
`Without thinking, even Kumasawa caught Gohda's high spirits. `
`The kitchen had a very nice smell and atmosphere about it, truly refreshing for so early in the morning. `
`Then, Kanon came back, grumpy even this early in the morning, just like he always was. `
`Kanon and Genji were in charge of getting many things ready for the morning, such as opening the curtains. `
`...However, Kanon was alone today, so it had taken much longer than usual. `
`"I'm done. `
`...Where's Genji-sama?" `
`"He still isn't here. `
`......That's odd. `
`I can't imagine he'd sleep in." `
`"Hohoho. `
`I guess even Genji-san sleeps in sometimes." `
`"That's rather careless of him, considering that this is the middle of the family conference. `
`Kanon-san, `
`could you wake him for us?" `
`".........Yes." `
`"I wonder what Genji-san's face looks like when he's half asleep... `
`Hohohoho. Let me go with you." `
`Even though Gohda had asked her to get the serving cart ready, `
`Kumasawa plodded off after Kanon, slyly skipping work. `
`As Kanon muttered about how Gohda was the one who slept in all the time, `
`he headed for the servant waiting room. `
`"So, you didn't wake him up this morning, Kanon-san?" `
`"...Last night, I fell asleep while still in the servant room, so I didn't return to the waiting room." `
`Last night, Kanon had dozed off while in the middle of his late night shift, `
`falling asleep in the servant room. `
`Shannon had been kind enough to put a blanket on him, `
`but that had just made it so warm that he fell into an even deeper sleep... `
`So he hadn't returned to his bed in the servant waiting room the previous night. `
`Because of that, he hadn't met Genji even once this morning. `
`There was a knock on the door. `
`"...Genji-sama, `
`it's Kanon. `
`Good morning." `
`"......Oh my. `
`I wonder if he's still sleeping." `
`"...Pardon me." `
`When he tried to open the door, `
`...Kanon noticed something strange on the upper part of it. `
`...What's that? ...Packing tape?? `
`A small strip of packing tape was stuck along the frame of the door, `
`almost as though it was sealing the door shut. `
`Furthermore, there were notches made with scissors along the center of the packing tape, `
`so that if you opened the door only a slight amount, it would be torn apart. `
`Also, written sloppily across the packing tape with a thin pen was what appeared to be someone's signature. `
`...It was written in a very intricate and decorative manner, `
`so even if it was a signature, there was no way of telling whose it was. `
`"It's probably some sort of prank..." `
`"I don't get it, but it's no use worrying about it now. `
`...Genji-sama, `
`pardon me." `
`The packing tape tore apart, and he opened the door. `
`It wasn't as though anything happened when it split, so the two quickly forgot about that strange tape. `
`...The room was dimly lit. `
`The lower bed of the two-level bunk bed still had a lump under the blanket. `
`Apparently, Genji was still sleeping... `
`"Good morning, Genji-sama." `
`"This isn't like you. Ho ho ho. `
`It's morning!" `
`".........! `
`G-Genji-sama...!" `
`"Eek, ...wh-what is this, what is this...?!" `
`There was a large, red-black stain on the blanket. `
`...Even the servants' blankets were always kept clean. `
`A stain like that definitely shouldn't have been there. `
`Kanon hesitantly peeled back Genji's blanket, `
`......saw what was left of him, `
`...and was shocked into silence. `
`"Wh-What the heck? `
`His neck's been cut open!" `
`"......It's thin. `
`...You wouldn't be able to leave a cut this deep without a fairly long blade." `
`"Wh-What's going on? `
`Battler solved the riddle of the epitaph, right? `
`Why are there murders happening?!" `
`"I don't know. `
`...In any event, this isn't good. `
`We should report this to {f:5:Beatrice}-sama and Natsuhi-sama." `
`"Belpha, hurry and report to Luci-nee...!!" `
`"Understood...!" `
`After dashing out, Kumasawa called Gohda and Shannon over. `
`...Then, this new pair let out screams identical to the first two. `
`"Nooooo! `
`Don't stop making breakfast, Gohda!" `
`"Is now really the time to be saying that?!! `
`...There's no chance they'll have a quiet and peaceful breakfast on the second day. `
`...I have a bad feeling about this. `
`Genji might not be the only one. `
`...Let's check the entire mansion. Something else might've happened...!" `
`"Yes, Onee-sama!!" `
`Natsuhi sprang awake at the sudden sound of the phone. `
`Even Natsuhi was surprised that she'd woken up. `
`...She'd thought she'd spent the whole night unable to sleep out of fear that the mysterious man might come in at any moment, `
`but she'd dozed off before she knew it... `
`Of course, Natsuhi still didn't feel rested at all. `
`Though she groaned from the dull pain in her head, which hadn't gone away once since last night, `
`she managed to get out of bed... `
`"Morning, Natsuhi-sama." `
`"......Morning. `
`...And what a horrible morning it is..." `
`"Don't worry. `
`No one tried to enter this room." `
`"...I see. `
`...Thanks for keeping watch all night..." `
`Even so, that didn't mean she'd been able to sleep peacefully. `
`......The continued ringing of the phone made her headache throb even more strongly... `
`"I think you should probably answer the phone. `
`...And then, I've got some bad news to report from my sisters." `
`"...Let's leave the bad news for later. `
`...I'll answer the phone first." `
`Natsuhi shook her head to wake herself and picked up the receiver. `
`...Then, she regretted not listening to Lucifer's bad news first. `
`...Because she wanted the first thing she heard on this horrible morning to be something better than this... `
`"......Morning, Mother. `
`...Did you sleep well?" `
`That voice...told her that this horrible morning--this nightmare--would not stop... `
`"...I-I kept my promise. `
`I've been holed up in this room the whole time. `
`Of course, I haven't been on the phone either...!" `
`"But you did pick up the phone just now, did you not...?" `
`"...W-Well, ...ah-" `
`"Ahahahahahahahaha. `
`...Just kidding. `
`This is just a morning call I am giving my beloved Mother. `
`Morning, Mother. `
`......*giggle*giggle*...!" `
`"......How far do you intend to mock me...?" `
`Natsuhi gripped the receiver so hard it creaked... `
`"I wanted you to leave your seat so that I could set up for the party. `
`...Thanks to that, everything is ready now. `
`Of course, you are the main guest, Mother." `
`"...Wh-What are you planning to do...?" `
`"That is for you to look forward to. `
`...Do not worry, I will not keep you waiting. `
`It has already begun. `
`...Oh, right, wait a sec. `
`There is someone I want you to hear." `
`"...Huh?" `
`There was the sound of the receiver being jolted around. `
`...The phone was apparently being passed to someone else, but there was a clunking, clattering noise, `
`as though it was taking a lot of effort to hand the receiver over... `
`Who in the world could he be giving the phone to? `
`...No matter who...this man gives the phone to...that can't be good news for me... `
`"...Gwah! `
`Untie me...! `
`Coward...!!" `
`"Huh?! `
`...D-Dear?! `
`Is that you?!" `
`"Gghgghghghghgh, mwoooohh...!! `
`Untie it, untie iiiit!!" `
`It was, without a doubt, the voice of her husband. `
`However, he didn't respond to Natsuhi's voice. `
`...Perhaps he was bound somewhere in the darkness. `
`Krauss, not realizing that Natsuhi was on the other end of the phone, repeatedly demanded that he be untied... `
`"...Your husband is here. `
`His eyes and ears are covered, so you won't be able to talk, `
`but I think you can tell that he is in perfect health." `
`"Wh-What are you after...?!! `
`Let my husband go!" `
`"I will let him go tomorrow. `
`If you keep two promises, that is." `
`"What are they...?!" `
`"One is that you keep it a secret that I have your husband in my care. `
`...There will probably be a fuss when they are unable to find Krauss anywhere in the mansion, `
`but you know nothing, so you will say nothing. `
`...Understand?" `
`"I-I understand...! `
`What's your other condition?!" `
`"...Oh, just a little game. `
`At 1:00 today, `
`you will go into the foremost guest room on the first floor of the mansion and hide in the closet." `
`"A guest room...? `
`Why should I go into a closet...?!" `
`"Just a little hide-and-seek. `
`If you can hide there for an hour without anyone finding you, you win. `
`...If someone does find you, you lose." `
`"And if I lose, `
`...what happens...?!" `
`"Nothing in particular. `
`...Is that not what playing is all about? `
`If you play along with this hide-and-seek, I will release your husband tomorrow." `
`"W- `
`Will you really... `
`keep that promise, I wonder...?" `
`"Of course. `
`Make sure you do too, Mother. `
`...If you break our promise, I will know right away." `
`At that time, there was suddenly a loud knock on the door to Natsuhi's room. `
`Her heart leapt automatically. `
`"...Madam, are you there? `
`Good morning...!" `
`"It's Gohda and Kanon! `
`Madam, please wake up...!" `
`The voices coming from across the door were Kanon's and Gohda's. `
`...The knock had been wild, and the voices a little shrill. `
`...It seemed that something strange had happened...and that they were agitated. `
`"......What is it? `
`Did something happen?" `
`"I-It's nothing. `
`It looks like the servants have arrived. `
`I'm hanging up." `
`"Sure. `
`I have said everything I wanted to. `
`......So, do not break our promise." `
`"...I understand. `
`A-And you don't break our promise either...!" `
`"You have it wrong. `
`That is for you to decide, Mother. `
`......Do not make me break my promise, `
`Mother." `
`"......Ack..." `
`"I will be watching you all day today, Mother. `
`*giggle*giggle*, ahahahaha, ohohohohoho!" `
`*clank*! `
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} slammed the receiver down on the antique phone. `
`Then, the phone exploded into bits and became a golden splash, then a cloud of gold butterflies, and then disappeared. `
`"*giggle* Dance for me, Natsuhi! `
`Dance in fear of your sin 19 years ago!! `
`My turn's going pretty well. `
`Okay, your turn now, Bern!!" `
`"......I'm sure this is a waste of time, but let me confirm whether correspondence with the outside world, including reporting this to the police, is possible or not." `
`"It's impossible to make use of the external line! `
`Looks like you can use the internal line! `
`It's impossible to use a boat inside the typhoon! `
`I guess the closed circle is complete now! `
`Congrats, you're a full detective now, Bern!" `
`When the police intervene, they sometimes steal some of the detective's authority. `
`However, with the construction of the closed circle, the existence of police had been denied for all eternity. `
`From now on, the authority of the detective piece will be totally guaranteed. `
`"Yeah, yeah, thanks a bunch. `
`Then I guess it's time to get this game started." `
`Erika, you're the main character. `
`Now, begin...! `
`"...E-Even Genji-san?! `
`F-Five people have been killed?!" `
`"Y-Yes. `
`...And it was so...horrible...!" `
`"It was exactly the same as the four in the guesthouse... `
`...The neck...was sliced open...with a terribly sharp blade..." `
`"...T-To think that even though I had the midnight shift, ...I didn't notice anyone suspicious..." `
`"Don't blame yourself. `
`...If you'd bumped into the culprit, you might be the one dead right now." `
`"On top of that, the phones aren't even connectin'...! `
`I doubt any boats'll come in this weather. `
`This is serious...!" `
`"...And that makes it very likely the culprit's still nearby." `
`"E-Eeeeeeeeeeeeekkkk...! `
`Then what? `
`Does that mean we'll be trapped here with a murderer until the typhoon passes and the boat comes...?!" `
`"...I-It'll be okay. `
`If we all stay together like this, even the culprit won't be able to lay a finger on us...!" `
`"...E-Even Jessica... `
`...I can't believe it......" `
`"W-We won't let ourselves be killed...!! `
`I'll avenge George!! `
`I won't let them get away! `
`No matter who the culprit is or what their reason was, I won't let the one who killed George get away!! `
`I'll kill them, I'll kill them!! `
`Waaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh...!!" `
`"......Okay, everyone, are you done crying yet? Silence, please. `
`...Has anyone seen Krauss-san yet?" `
`"...We've been calling him for a while, but he hasn't answered..." `
`"Could the receiver be off the hook...?" `
`"No, we could hear it ringing. `
`There's no way he didn't hear it..." `
`"............" `
`"Wh-What does it mean...? `
`You don't think...Uncle Krauss too...?!" `
`".........Figures. `
`......I hate to say it at a time like this, ...but there were four in the guesthouse, plus Genji to make five. `
`...I figured there would be one more." `
`"Why?! `
`How could you know that?! `
`Are you the culprit?! `
`Did you kill George?!" `
`"St-Stop it, Eva-san...! `
`Now is not the time...!" `
`Eva got agitated and grabbed at Kyrie. `
`Nanjo stepped in between them, and it grew into a bit of a scuffle... `
`Watching this, Erika smiled condescendingly and shrugged. `
`"Of course. `
`It's natural you'd guess there were six victims after seeing the crime scene in the guesthouse. `
`There were only four corpses, so it'd make you wonder who the other two were." `
`"How could you know such a thing?!! `
`You killed them?! `
`You killed Geoooooorge!!" `
`"Qu-Quit it, Eva! `
`......Erika-chan, Kyrie-san...! `
`How can you know that?! `
`Can't you think before you talk...?!" `
`"......It's a simple connection to make. `
`The scribble drawn at the scene of the crime in the guesthouse was a magic circle. `
`I just tried to think of things connected to both magic and murders." `
`"Ah, ......so it's the epitaph, huh?" `
`"...I see... `
`......It's......the first twilight." `
`"Huh? ...Huh? `
`What's going on...?!" `
`"W-Well, I don't have a clue either...!!" `
`"......Is that how it is...? `
`...That damn witch..." `
`"So is this really......{f:5:Beatrice}-sama's doing...?" `
`"Why do you all keep talking as if you know something?!! `
`I don't have a clue!! `
`Someone, explain!!" `
`"I told you, Eva...! Calm down a bit...!!" `
`"..............." `
`"...That's how it is. `
`Ever since I saw the magic circle at that crime scene, `
`I imagined this might be a plotline murder following the epitaph's first twilight, which would mean there are six victims." `
`"...Simply by the existence of the magic circle in that place, `
`this level of reasoning is possible for Furudo Erika. `
`What do you think, everyone?" `
`"......So, Uncle Krauss was also...killed...?" `
`"We can't be sure of that. `
`...Krauss-san isn't the only person who hasn't come here, right? `
`There's one more." `
`".........!" `
`For just an instant, Natsuhi's brow furrowed...... `
`So, ...she hadn't been able to avoid the topic of the study after all... `
`"You don't mean...Dad?! `
`Hey, someone must've contacted the study, right?!" `
`"O-Of course we called...and even knocked on the door... `
`But, umm, there was no answer..." `
`"...F-Father is immersing himself in his research... `
`H-He sometimes leaves the receiver off the hook because he doesn't want to be called and even ignores any knocking...!" `
`"...B-But the phone was ringing..." `
`"A-Anyway...! `
`Let's first check to see that my husband's safe!! `
`Let's go to his room!!" `
`Natsuhi stood up in a flurry and dashed out into the corridor. `
`Rudolf and the others immediately chased after her, telling her to wait. `
`".........Come on, let's all go together. `
`In both third-rate mysteries and third-rate horrors, people who act alone tend to die first. `
`...Yeah, this game is just the same. `
`...Beato really is third-rate. `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*...!" `
`Oh, but in third-rate disaster movies and third-rate action movies, people who act alone do survive, right? `
`Weird. `
`*giggle*giggle*! `
`"...Even though the epitaph has already been solved... `
`...Who's behind this farce...?" `
`"It might be the work of this man from 19 years ago, ...who is thought to be Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s piece. `
`...Ah yes, that can't be true." `
`"...In the games up until now, Beato has already stated that Kinzo has vanished, `
`meaning that no more than 17 people exist and no 18th person exists. `
`Now that Erika has been added, it's been stated that no 19th person exists. `
`There's no room for this man from 19 years ago to appear on the island." `
`"So, the man from 19 years ago is disguised as one of the existing Humans, `
`...or else..." `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`Even if a 19th person isn't permitted by the red, `
`slipping in a 19th person is no trouble for me, no trouble for witches...! `
`Now it's getting interesting. Why don't we watch this a little longer?" `
`"Still, those two witches... `
`have finally started to do whatever they please with my game board, haven't they...?!" `
`"......Didn't you know that would happen when you invited them?" `
`"Hmph. `
`...As a witch, I have the same dislike for boredom as they do. `
`Even the unexpected brings the kind of joy a witch expects. `
`Very well, bring it on...!" `
`"It's great that you're so eager, ...but things have taken a nasty turn. `
`Get it?" `
`".........Indeed. `
`Perhaps this isn't the best time to wait and see what happens next." `
`"I know that. `
`At this rate, Kinzo's existence will become an issue once again. `
`...And the barrier around the study won't last long." `
`"That isn't all. `
`Things are going to get even worse. `
`......See? `
`Move one, `
`move two, `
`move three. `
`...And then you're cornered, `
`...Natsuhi." `
`Gaap whispered something into Beato's ear. `
`Beato's mouth...slowly widened into a grin. `
`"...Erika bringing everyone together is actually convenient for us. `
`All darkness outside the range of observers belongs to us demons. `
`...This may be the only time to make that move." `
`"Natsuhi is the king. `
`She can't move far, but we cannot allow her to be taken! `
`...Let's take the initiative. `
`If we slip up here, Natsuhi will be cornered...! `
`Gaap, can I count on you?!" `
`"Of course! `
`...I'll blow a hole through closed room tricks, alibis, and mysteries alike. `
`......Leave it to me. I'll handle it." `
`Gaap was swallowed up, along with the chair she sat in, into a pitch-black hole that opened on the floor and then disappeared. `
`After that, a hole opened on the ceiling and spat just the chair back out, returning the place to the way it had been... `
`"...This is becoming troublesome." `
`"Heh, ...heheheheheheheh. `
`...I see. `
`Against Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, even I am nothing more than a mere piece. `
`So, in the early game, I must worry more about expansion than losing or taking pieces. `
`......*cackle*cackle*! `
`I'm just no match for that person! `
`I won't let her do that. Natsuhi is the final master I will serve! `
`Know that this is a piece you'll never be allowed to take, so long as she has a contract with me, {f:5:Beatrice}!!" `
`"Krauss's room was empty. `
`The bed was too, `
`but massive bloodstains similar to the other crime scenes remained." `
`"But there was no corpse." `
`"Nope." `
`"Then he isn't dead." `
`"Maybe not. Heheheheheheheh...!!" `
`"...What's going on?! `
`Where's Nii-san?!" `
`"Judging by this bloodstained bed... `
`I don't like to think about it, but we should probably assume that he was killed and had his neck cut open, just like the people in the guesthouse..." `
`"......Probably... `
`Judging by the amount of blood lost, ...it's hard to imagine that he's okay..." `
`"B-But... `
`where did Krauss-sama go...?" `
`Large amounts of blood stained the top of the bed, but there were no similar marks on the floor of the room. `
`Whether Krauss had been seriously wounded and wandered off somewhere...or killed and carried somewhere, `
`...they had no clue where this "somewhere" might be. `
`"..............." `
`...Natsuhi knew. `
`Though Krauss had been sounding far from his best over the phone, at least he hadn't sounded like he was on the brink of death. `
`In other words, these blood stains had to be a setup. `
`That might not even be blood... `
`......However, ...just what was that man thinking? `
`...What's this supposed to be...?! `
`"What the heck...... `
`...So, on the first twilight, ...there were six sacrifices...?" `
`"......Was Krauss nii-san in the habit of locking his door? `
`We just came in without unlocking it." `
`"...Yes, Krauss-sama also has a habit of locking up." `
`"A-At this house, `
`Madam has ordered that all non-public areas be locked." `
`"How many keys can unlock Uncle Krauss's room?" `
`"In addition to the one key Krauss-sama held, there's the master keys..." `
`"Oh, all that stuff about keys is a pointless argument. `
`...Did you forget that Genji-san is already a victim? `
`His master key is missing. `
`That means all the locks in this mansion are meaningless." `
`"......How boring. `
`In other words, no closed room murders have existed or will exist in this mansion. `
`...Sheesh. `
`This is getting to be a pretty boring mystery." `
`Erika laughed off this murder in disappointment, as though it was something she was watching on TV. `
`...I can't understand it. `
`...Why is "her world" so different from ours? `
`It's almost like she's in a separate dimension from us... `
`"...W-Was Jessica also... `
`like this, ...in a bed?" `
`"............" `
`"...Yes, that's right. `
`...Just like George, her neck......was cut..." `
`"...Jessica... `
`...Let me be with Jessica... `
`I haven't even seen Jessica's face yet...! `
`......Jessica, ...Jessicaaaaaaaa!!" `
`"W-Wait up, Natsuhi-san...!!" `
`"The culprit might still be hiding nearby! `
`It would be dangerous to let her be alone..." `
`Natsuhi flew out of the room and dashed towards the guesthouse this time. `
`...It was only natural. `
`Natsuhi still hadn't even seen Jessica's dying face. `
`Everyone probably thought that. `
`......Of course, even Natsuhi was half thinking that. `
`The other half... `
`...was her desire to shift everyone else's attention away from the study. `
`Strange crimes had occurred, the gold had been discovered, and some relatives had even recommended Battler to be the Successor. `
`Even in these twisted circumstances, `
`......she had to protect Kinzo's secret. `
`......Aahh, ...if my head...is going to be wracked by this suffering anyway... `
`...Please, just let my head explode right now. `
`That way, I won't have to suffer any longer...... `
`"So, everyone, `
`for Natsuhi-san's sake, let's return to the guesthouse for the time being. `
`...Though it's not as though seeing their dead faces is going to lead to any new developments." `
`"......Do you even have a heart?" `
`"A heart? `
`What's that?" `
`Just seeing her daughter's dead face wouldn't bring Jessica back to life, nor would it heal Natsuhi's anguish. `
`On the contrary, she would probably wail, wasting a considerable amount of time before being able to think properly again. `
`...This probably sums up Erika's screwed up argument... `
`............... `
`Just seeing their dying faces won't lead to any new developments...? `
`"Like hell it won't! `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle* `
`Beato's pieces have brought about a really interesting change. *giggle*giggle*!" `
`"Wh-What in the........." `
`Natsuhi flew into the cousin room on the second floor of the guesthouse... `
`...and was struck dumb by the bloodstained beds and the eerie magic circle, which looked like it might've been drawn with the victims' blood... `
`"...Where is Jessica...? `
`Where is she...?! Jessicaaa!!" `
`"In that... `
`...bed......" `
`"A bed? `
`Where?!" `
`"Huh? `
`...George...? `
`...Wh-Where is he...?!" `
`"Wait a sec, `
`...what the hell... `
`...is going on here...?" `
`"......We made sure to lock this room when we left, right? `
`We can now be certain the culprit has a master key. `
`Once again, my reasoning was correct." `
`"Who cares about that...?! `
`Where did they go...? `
`Wh-Where did everyone's corpses go...?!" `
`".........Heheh. `
`Nice trick." `
`"Hey, look, look, it's magic, right? `
`That Gaap who's with Beato hid the corpses somewhere with magic...!" `
`"...All of us moved together. `
`So you're trying to say that everyone had alibis?" `
`"Your reasoning goes like this, right? `
`The four of them weren't actually dead, they were just playing dead. `
`Then, when no one else was around, they hid somewhere. `
`Am I right?" `
`"You don't intend to proclaim any of their deaths in red now, do you?" `
`"Of course I won't. `
`Unlike that dolt Beato, I don't give red out for free!" `
`"In that case, I'll be glad to use the blue truth. `
`I can think of many ways to work around something of this level." `
`"*giggle* `
`Sure, go ahead! `
`Blue truth time!" `
`"Here's the first one I can think of. `
`{p:2:The victims aren't actually dead. `
`They pretended to be dead, then secretly hid themselves somewhere. `
`After all, you haven't declared anyone's death with the red truth}." `
`"Ahhaha! `
`Even through you've been shown their gaping wounds, you're still trying that one on principle, as long as there's no red, right?! `
`But don't get your hopes up. `
`I'm not giving you a freebie red truth! `
`After all, I just have to deny it all at once at the end of the game, at 24:00 on October 5th!" `
`"Ah, the witch's side has such a big advantage! `
`It'd all be over now if that stupid Battler was my opponent, but you aren't like that, right, Bern?!" `
`"Of course. `
`Anyone could've thought of that silly move. `
`I have more. `
`Second one. `
`{p:2:Krauss carried the bodies off and hid them. `
`You're making it look like you've kidnapped Krauss and locked him up somewhere, but he might actually be free. `
`Krauss has no alibi. `
`Krauss hid their corpses}." `
`"Yeah, that's right. `
`It's not like I proclaimed that Krauss was being confined with the red truth. *giggle*giggle*! `
`You know how they say you've gotta confuse your friends before you can confuse your enemies! `
`So he lied to Natsuhi, making it seem like he'd been captured?! `
`Heheheheheheh!! `
`Any others?!" `
`"Third one. `
`{p:2:The corpses were different people in the first place. `
`They were substitute corpses made to look like the victims. `
`George and the others were hiding from the beginning, and later cleared away the substitute corpses. `
`The corpses were dead from the very beginning, so they don't count towards the number of people on the island}." `
`"Ahhahhahhahahahahahahahaha!! `
`That's messed up!! `
`So even though all those people gathered around and saw their dead faces, none of them realized they were substitute corpses?" `
`"Since you haven't used the red truth, there's a possibility that everyone misidentified all of the corpses. `
`Though if you feel like repeating "no one would misidentify a person", I'll withdraw that claim immediately, okay...?" `
`"No way{p:0:♪} I'm not falling for that! `
`The red truth's only useful if you use it with flash, right? `
`I'll take a single truth out of a large pile of blue and smash it with the red! `
`Then, the rest of the blue truths will be swallowed up by darkness before you can find out whether they were right or wrong!" `
`"That darkness is the world of witches! `
`You won't be given any truth at all! `
`Ehheheheheheheheheheheheheh!!" `
`......Heheh. `
`...This girl acts like she's stupid, but she's not bad at all. `
`She'll never rise to provocation. `
`Looks like she understands the darkness of magic even better than the true Game Master, Beato. `
`And apparently, Gaap also understood that well. `
`...That move of hiding the corpses. `
`It was pretty effective for both Lambda and Beato. `
`In any event, I've thought up a full three theories about the disappearing corpses. `
`Three blue wedges for a single riddle. `
`That doesn't mean she can just deny one of those three. `
`Unless she eliminates all three wedges, this riddle has been defeated. `
`That's the ironclad rule of witch hunting. `
`A single wedge isn't nearly enough. `
`Only vampires die from a single stake. `
`Compared to witches, vampires are weak. `
`...True witches won't die unless you stab them all over with stakes, right? `
`It's the same with assassins, isn't it? `
`It's only in Japanese manga that you see assassins kill their targets with a single perfect shot. `
`Real assassins will empty out an entire magazine's worth of bullets. `
`......That's how you do things, right? `
`Of course, it's the same for me. `
`But it's this girl we're talking about, so she might slice it all in two with a single swipe of the red. `
`By simply letting off a few quick lines confirming their deaths and Krauss's innocence with the red, `
`she can remove all three of my wedges. `
`Well, that's okay. `
`When the red truth does come out, I just need to follow along with it and stab her full of blue wedges again. `
`......*giggle*giggle* `
`This is how a game of witches plays out. `
`*giggle* Ah, it's so fun...! `
`Battler's sluggish battles always pissed me off, so I'm loving this...!! `
`Yeah, I understand, Lambda. `
`This first twilight is just the beginning of the beginning. `
`It's just a skirmish, right...? `
`*giggle* ......Wouldn't have it any other way... `
`......I'll make you lose pathetically and cry out in regret as you crawl and scratch at the floor! `
`I've almost forgotten the pleasure of grabbing that cute hair of yours and wiping the floor with it as I roll around laughing...!! `
`The servant waiting room in the mansion had once again gone silent... `
`There lay Genji's corpse, which had been covered completely with a blanket... `
`In the ceiling of this cramped room, a pitch-black hole appeared, `
`...captivating legs sprouted out, `
`...and Gaap floated downwards. `
`"......Sorry, Genji. `
`You probably want to enjoy your eternal sleep right there, but that's not going to be possible. `
`Please disappear from this place so that you may serve Natsuhi, the final Head of the Ushiromiya family, even after death." `
`Gaap stripped off the blanket as she said this to Genji, who was sleeping peacefully... `
`Then she stared at the deep wound in his neck... `
`"......That's a nice cut. `
`...It must've been made with a single slice. `
`......Has anyone who's capable of this manifested yet...? `
`Not good. `
`...I can't think of anyone decent who might be capable of this." `
`It goes without saying, but witches are capable of summoning beings with a strength proportional to their own ability. `
`The Great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} called that being here as a trump card 19th person. `
`......Even optimistically speaking, this is on par with Ronove and me... `
`A pitch-black hole opened on the bed, and Genji disappeared as though the bed had swallowed him up. `
`Just like the four in the guesthouse, Genji's corpse was also hidden in some unknown place... `
`It was a place that no one could find, located neither within this world nor the next... `
`No longer would anyone be able to find their corpses. `
`No longer would anyone be able to confirm their deaths. `
`She carried Genji's corpse to this place of endless silence, `
`where it would never be disturbed... `
`"When there's no corpse, a person goes missing. `
`...When a person's missing, people both suspect that they might be the culprit and suspect that they might be victims, truly like the inside of a cat box. `
`...The darkness inside of cat boxes that'll never be opened...is where we demons and witches reside...! `
`You were a bit too slow, Miss Great Detective. ......Heheheheh..." `
`Gaap licked her lips and gulped... `
`"...I wonder why Gaap-sama is going around hiding corpses." `
`"I don't know. `
`But Gaap-sama is pretty cool. `
`She's just so...awesome." `
`"Don't be stupid, what happened to standing guard?! `
`The Humans are returning from the guesthouse!! `
`Gaap-sama...!" `
`"Yes, let's disperse. `
`......This should be enough to give Natsuhi a way out..." `
`Gaap jumped into a pitch-black hole that had opened near her feet. `
`Mammon said "I'm going in too!" and jumped in, `
`followed by Asmo, who said "Me too, me too!" and hopped in, giggling. `
`As Satan hesitated over what to do, the hole closed. `
`"A-And you call yourselves members of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory... H-How childish. `
`So stupid...!" `
`Satan went bright red and got angry all by herself, then turned into gold butterflies and disappeared... `
`"......It seems Gaap has succeeded in moving the five corpses." `
`"Well done. `
`...However, the next part is tricky." `
`"They will probably be somewhat surprised at the disappearance of Genji's corpse, `
`but their interest will most likely swing back to Kinzo's study after that." `
`"...There are two keys to the study. `
`...It's fortunate that Natsuhi is in possession of both. `
`If she had left one with Genji, it would probably have fallen into Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s hands by now." `
`"It seems that Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} has no intention of hiding Kinzo's death. `
`...Apparently, she plans to fight while ignoring the moat, towers, and ramparts that you have created." `
`"Heh, ...heheheh. `
`This has become a strange triangular confrontation. `
`We are all each other's enemies, but we will sometimes join forces without notice. `
`...In a three-way fight, just when you think it's two against one, it suddenly becomes one against two. `
`...That's what it's like. `
`That Chinese battle royale! `
`Don't you think it's like that "Records of the Three Kingdoms" thing?" `
`"Oh, the Longzhong Plan. `
`That's quite a sophisticated analogy to hear coming from you, pu ku ku...!" `
`"There were three empires in Records of the Three Kingdoms, weren't there? `
`Wei, Wu, and Shu, right? `
`That sounds just like us. `
`...So, which empire won out in the end?" `
`"...The power that gained control in the end was the Jin dynasty. `
`The three empires you mentioned were all destroyed." `
`"Hoh. `
`.........I didn't know that. `
`I thought one of the three empires won. `
`Didn't the Wei have an overwhelming advantage...?" `
`"They had the position of emperor stolen from them, and their empire was subjugated and destroyed." `
`...The Sima clan, a noble family that Cao Cao invited in as advisors, `
`eventually gained central control in a power struggle and took over the country. `
`"......So, they were invited in as advisors, `
`...and they seized control. `
`......*cackle* ...Very interesting. `
`...That Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}...! `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!" `
`"Pardon me. `
`...The Humans have confirmed the disappearance of Genji's corpse in the servant waiting room. `
`...They have started moving towards Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}'s study." `
`"Riiche, `
`...they're coming." `
`"Hmph, ...let them come. `
`The Humans...and the Witches of Certainty and Miracles..." `
`If this is a three way fight, then we've got Humans, witches, and... `
`...what should we be called...? `
`If the thing we're protecting for the time being...is Kinzo's phantom... `
`"...So, ......are we...phantoms then......? `
`...Heheh, ...heheheheheheheh..." `
