`{a:c: `
`"It's Natsuhi, please open up...!!"} `
`As she knocked loudly and repeatedly, Natsuhi yelled. `
`Shortly after, there was a heavy clunking sound, and the sound of the door to Kinzo's study unlocking could be heard. `
`As the door opened, a heavily sweet, venomous odor flowed out. `
`Natsuhi was always ashamed of how she automatically grimaced at that, `
`even though she thought it rude to the Family Head... `
`Krauss was waiting for her inside the study. `
`Natsuhi flew into his arms. `
`"......I-Is Father... ......Is he......" `
`"Calm yourself. `
`......Doctor Nanjo is examining him now..." `
`With an uncertain gait, Natsuhi walked towards the center of the study, supported by Krauss. `
`There, a dignified bed fitting for the Ushiromiya Family Head could be seen, along with Nanjo, Genji, and Kumasawa... `
`"Doctor Nanjo, `
`i-is Father......" `
`After sighing deeply, Nanjo left the side of the bed. `
`On the bed, Kinzo could be seen lying down, asleep...... `
`"......He died peacefully. `
`...I don't think Kinzo-san had any regrets." `
`"Ah, ...aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh... `
`Father, ...Fatheeeeeeeeer...!!" `
`...Sobbing, Natsuhi slumped over the chest of that man, who had fallen into a sleep from which he would never awaken. `
`"...M-Madam, ...please...stay strong..." `
`"Father, Father...!! `
`This is...just too sudden... `
`Aaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!" `
`"..............." `
`Natsuhi couldn't stop crying over the death of the man whom she had loved like a second father. `
`Kumasawa rubbed Natsuhi's back, consoling her... `
`Krauss slumped into his late father's favorite chair. `
`By sitting there, he might have been immersed in memories of his departed father. `
`Or perhaps he thought that by sitting there, he might be able to understand just a bit of the madness of Kinzo's later years, `
`which he had never been able to comprehend before... `
`And Nanjo, just as he had when Kinzo once sat in that chair, contemplating a chess move, `
`...turned his back and looked down over the outside world through a crack in the curtains... `
`"...If only he'd been sick in bed for a year or so first. `
`I do wish he could have died after a grace period during which the proper arrangements could have been made." `
`"It's the other way around. `
`...We should be glad that he was in high spirits until the very end." `
`"At least that's true as far as public appearances are concerned..." `
`Nanjo understood that as well. `
`Ushiromiya Kinzo, who had risen like a comet and glittered like a supernova in the post-war business world, had died. `
`His funeral would probably be of a fantastic scale. `
`And it would also be the ceremony marking Krauss's inheritance of the Headship. `
`He would have to arrange everything as the host of the event, carry out funeral diplomacy perfectly, `
`and make it clear to all that the Ushiromiya family still had enormous influence in the political and financial spheres. `
`As Nanjo watched Krauss, he was vividly reminded of the time when Kinzo had been suddenly selected as the Ushiromiya Family Head, `
`when Kinzo had been lost and confused. `
`In this way, he was able to understand Krauss's distress and sympathize with it... `
`Natsuhi's sobs eventually subsided. `
`Watching this and leaving Kumasawa to care for Natsuhi as a fellow woman, Genji returned to where Krauss was. `
`And, as though asking what should be done, Genji lowered his head slightly. `
`"......Genji-san and I will deal with the formalities. `
`Krauss-san, perhaps you should contact the relatives first." `
`"..............." `
`Krauss, with his hands still over his eyes, didn't respond... `
`Perhaps even though he had known this day would come, Krauss really couldn't hide his shock at how suddenly it had reached them. `
`"......Leave this to Doctor Nanjo and me. `
`Krauss-sama, I suggest that you first speak with Madam." `
`Maybe she heard that, or maybe it was a coincidence. `
`As though responding to Genji's words, Natsuhi came over. `
`Her eyes were red from crying so much, `
`but she apparently understood the heavy responsibility that had been imposed on them even better than Krauss did. `
`"Starting now, you are the Head of the glorious Ushiromiya family. `
`Let us show everyone, inside and out, that you have splendidly succeeded your Father. `
`......As your wife, I, Natsuhi, am prepared to serve you until the day our coffins are laid down alongside each other!" `
`".................." `
`Trying to encourage her husband, who was overcome with shock, Natsuhi lent him some reassuring words. `
`When Krauss finally lowered the hands that had been covering his face, `
`...he looked up at the ceiling with a blank expression and let out a deep, deep sigh... `
`"...Please, stay strong. `
`There are a great many people who will plan to devour everything Father has left behind. `
`We must fight to protect Father's honor and wealth. `
`That is the first responsibility of the Ushiromiya Head." `
`"...I understand. `
`I do understand." `
`"Doctor Nanjo, Genji, please take care of the legal and funeral arrangements. `
`Especially you, Genji. `
`I ask that you take particular care and see to it that the funeral will be a fitting one for Father." `
`"...Certainly." `
`"And Doctor Nanjo. `
`Father didn't pass away in a hospital, ...so..." `
`"Indeed. `
`An autopsy might be required, depending on circumstances..." `
`"Can't you do something about that...? `
`Even though he has passed away, Father's body is precious. `
`Any damage done to it would not be acceptable..." `
`"I understand how you feel. `
`...However, it is also important to deal with these matters properly. `
`And, umm, ...I don't really know how to say this, `
`but several of the relatives might make things difficult, yes...?" `
`...Who knew how those vultures after the inheritance might try to find fault with them? `
`They might claim to have found some reason to suspect the cause of death, using that as a point of contention to start some trouble. `
`Right now, it was important not only to pay Kinzo's remains the respect they were due, but also to solidify the position of the new Family Head, Krauss... `
`"...Understood. `
`Please keep it to an absolute minimum. `
`Make sure that Father's dignity is not damaged, even by mistake." `
`"That will be fine. `
`Do not worry. `
`...In any event, leave Kinzo-san to us and stay by Krauss-san's side. `
`...Things will start to get quite difficult from here on out." `
`"I understand. `
`...And you too, dear... Please stay strong." `
`"..............." `
`Krauss was still staring blankly at the ceiling with a befuddled expression on his face... `
`She understood the shock and heavy responsibility he bore. `
`Natsuhi understood her husband's feelings as much as anyone. `
`"...I will contact the relatives. `
`Please rest for the time being." `
`"............" `
`Krauss didn't respond. `
`...Natsuhi, thinking him to be just a bit unreliable at the moment, decided she must offer her support. `
`Seeing her husband like this actually spurred Natsuhi to action, and a resolute expression rose to her face. `
`"Things will get busy from now on. `
`Let's start by doing whatever we can right now. `
`......I'm sure my husband wants to have some time alone with Father. `
`We should step out for a moment." `
`"...Good point... `
`After all, this will probably be the last time he gets that chance." `
`Being in charge of a funeral is tiring work. `
`There's no time to shed tears. `
`If Krauss were ever to be given time to cry for his dead father, that time would have to be now. `
`Everyone agreed with Kumasawa's words. `
`Even so, Krauss continued to blankly gaze up at the ceiling and didn't respond in any way. `
`Natsuhi urged the servants to go. `
`"I'll go talk to Jessica too. `
`...That child is now the Successor to the Headship. `
`I'll make sure to tell her to be fully prepared." `
`{a:c: `
`"Wait."} `
`As they each started to make their way out of the study, Krauss finally spoke. `
`They stopped walking. `
`"Yes?" `
`"...Wait." `
`"......Yes??" `
`Hadn't she already stopped walking, just like her husband had asked? `
`But despite that, he told her once again to wait. `
`From those slightly weak words, Natsuhi understood that he'd probably stopped her because he wanted her to be by his side. `
`"The rest of you, downstairs. `
`I will stay with my husband. `
`Please call us on the phone if anything happens." `
`"...Certainly." `
`{e:150:"I thought I told you to wait!!"} `
`When Krauss suddenly raised his voice, everyone jumped and turned around... `
`Unable to comprehend what she had done to spark her husband's wrath, Natsuhi ran up to him. `
`"What's wrong, dear...? `
`Have I said something rude...? `
`If so, please forgive me." `
`"No, no, that's not it, that's not it... `
`Wait a second, give me some time." `
`"Yes, I understand. `
`It's important to sort things out inside your heart. `
`...We were just going to leave this place in silence to give you some time, okay...?" `
`"And I'm telling you to wait before doing that...... `
`......Listen up. No one move. `
`Not even an inch... `
`...If you're tired, then feel free to sit in whatever chair or sofa you want. `
`So just stay quiet and don't talk, don't do anything!" `
`...Those unreasonable words felt like a glimpse of how Kinzo used to be. `
`Natsuhi couldn't hide her slight surprise at this behavior, which almost made it seem as though Kinzo had possessed her husband. `
`Natsuhi told the servants to wait for the time being. `
`She ordered them to sit on a sofa a short distance off, approached her husband, and spoke to him in a small voice... `
`"...If you order it, I will wait however long you ask. I won't move. `
`So please, try and calm yourself..." `
`"...No, ...that's not it, that's not it..." `
`Was it really blood, or was he actually being possessed? `
`Krauss's disorderly style of speech strongly resembled Kinzo's... `
`As she watched this, Natsuhi became certain that Krauss was Kinzo's son after all, `
`and that he was the true Successor, more suitable than any other person. `
`"......Natsuhi, `
`come here." `
`Krauss stood up and headed towards the window, trying to lengthen the distance between himself and the servants waiting on the sofa by even a small amount. `
`Natsuhi realized that he must have something secret to discuss. `
`"...Yes, dear. `
`...What is it...?" `
`"......Father dying... `
`is bad." `
`"But he has already passed away. `
`We cannot turn back time." `
`"That's not it. `
`...It's bad...that it happened now..." `
`"...What do you mean?" `
`"I've been putting Father's fortune up as collateral. `
`I won't be able to hide it when the division of the inheritance comes into question." `
`"Wh-What...? `
`C-Collateral, you say? `
`How much...?" `
`"...You remember how I helped out Kondo-kun back in Melody Land?" `
`"Didn't I tell you to break ties with that person? `
`I thought you said you'd refused him...! `
`Why?!" `
`"There is such a thing as a man's honor! `
`I couldn't refuse!" `
`Krauss claimed to hold honor as a virtue. `
`...However, Natsuhi knew that he most often used this as an excuse for when he reluctantly went along with some deal that he just couldn't refuse. `
`"Th-That wouldn't be a problem if we had plenty of money on hand...! `
`But didn't you borrow quite a lot of money for the plan to turn this island into a resort?!" `
`"Yeah, I did! `
`And there were people here and there who lent me a hand along the way! `
`If I'm going to repay them, I can't just sit around on my hands! `
`You need money to repay people! `
`You need money to make money! `
`You can't even get started without money! `
`And even the plan for this island would be proceeding smoothly if only there hadn't been problems with the planning company!" `
`"I made contact with a government official in the city. `
`I even got the governor's word that this would become the newest travel destination in the Tokyo Metropolis! `
`The groundwork I laid was completely perfect!! `
`Random chance and bad timing were against me! `
`It was just a bit of bad luck. `
`Like a traffic accident!!" `
`"That was no accident! `
`It was fraud! `
`You were tricked!! `
`They were never drawing up plans for turning this island into a resort in the first place!!" `
`"That's not true!! `
`Hijikata-kun's vision was simply overflowing with foresight! `
`The way his eyes always focused on the whole world and the future... `
`taught me that things I always believed to be mere dreams were only the tip of the iceberg of what is possible!! Expand your dreams! To the whole world, to the future! `
`You heard him say that too, right?!" `
`"Yes, I heard...! And I think I remember telling you what I thought after we returned home!! `
`I said that he was suspicious, `
`that he only spoke of dreams and didn't have his feet planted on the ground, `
`and that you must not have any further relations with him!!" `
`"Hijikata-kun is a wonderful, pleasant young man!! `
`One could learn a lot from the way he lives! `
`I can respect him despite his youth! `
`I won't have you insulting him!!" `
`"That's what you said about the whole moon tourism thing!! `
`You kept saying it was visionary, that it looked to the future, that it had high aspirations, and what was the end result?! `
`Eventually, you yourself admitted that it was utter nonsense, right?!! `
`I was sure something was wrong ever since that strange man showed up claiming to be a high-ranking NASA official!" `
`"That foreigner was nothing more than an international swindler! `
`Both Mr. Sonezaki and I were victims in that case. `
`Right now, his vision isn't mistaken! `
`In the future, there will surely come a time when the richest people in the world develop a liking for space travel. `
`And, the very first enterprise in that area will probably be monopolized by a single private company. `
`That viewpoint is not mistaken! `
`There was simply a group of international swindlers who were trying to take advantage of that fact and deceive investors across the world-" `
`"And I'm trying to tell you that this Sonezaki man was one of them too!! `
`Just how gullible are you? Why do you always just accept these suspicious offers without any doubts?!!" `
`"Take that back! `
`Mr. Sonezaki is a man with a brilliant future ahead of him! `
`There's nothing suspicious about him!! `
`Because the dreams he speaks of anticipate the future, they sound crazy to people who can't see into the future! `
`A woman like you can't see into the future!!" `
`"Yes, a woman like me can't see into the future!! `
`But I can see the present! `
`Right in front of me, I can see a pitiful husband who's been taken in by sly, double-crossing swindlers and still trusts them implicitly even after he's been tricked!!" `
`"Shut your mouth!! `
`You don't understand anything about money or business or economics!! `
`Don't try to butt in on your husband's job!! `
`A wife should be satisfied with doing housework! `
`Keep your mouth shut!!!" `
`"............! `
`........." `
`Without another word, Natsuhi fell silent, just as Krauss had hoped she would. `
`She was already far beyond anger and sadness. `
`And the emotion that lay on the other side of those...was an almost indifferent pity. `
`Krauss, who had been in awe of Kinzo since he was very young, had started to subconsciously admire the way his father lived. `
`...Without realizing it, he had come to believe that he could only be recognized as a man in his own right if he surpassed his father. `
`However, Kinzo had been a mad genius, the likes of which had never before been seen in the Ushiromiya family's long history. `
`That talent was a gift from heaven, `
`...and it definitely wasn't genetic, much less something that could be learned. `
`To give the two of them a chance to talk alone, `
`Natsuhi told the servants not to tell anyone about Kinzo's death, and they left the room for the time being. `
`Then, she invited Krauss to her bedroom... `
`and made him tell her everything about their current financial situation. `
`These were things that Natsuhi hadn't been told about, under the assumption that a woman had no business knowing. `
`Natsuhi had herself made a point of avoiding this area in the past, thinking that it wasn't a wife's place to intrude on such matters. `
`However, this might also have meant that she had abandoned her duty, as a wife, to protect her family. `
`The depths of this sin had been made quite clear to Natsuhi... `
`Krauss was probably tired of trying to defend himself. `
`Perhaps because he had gotten a headache, he hid his face and sank into silence... `
`Natsuhi noticed that the water in the electric kettle was boiling and stood up to refill her cup with black tea. `
`When she touched the cup of black tea, she noticed for the first time. `
`The sound of the cup and saucer clinking together told her that her fingers were shaking... `
`Krauss had built up a large debt to obtain funds for his various projects...and to cover the losses when they failed. `
`Of course, he had put the mansion and property up as collateral. `
`However, doing such a thing aboveboard would result in the mortgage being registered. `
`In other words, there would be a record that Krauss had put Kinzo's wealth up as collateral to obtain a loan without anyone's permission. `
`Kinzo, Eva, and the others must not learn of such a thing. `
`Therefore, Krauss had been putting those assets up as collateral using the worst possible method. `
`"......I signed over the deeds and power of attorney..." `
`"And...what does that mean...?" `
`What Krauss was saying probably meant that he had, in essence, signed away the rights to his assets. `
`If these assets had been used as collateral for a loan, then Krauss would still have some leeway under the law. `
`He would have to deal with a bank, which would have absolutely no compassion, `
`but they would be able to work something out within the rules set by society. `
`...However, signing away the deed and power of attorney was a whole different story. `
`In other words, even the mansion they were living in. `
`If the person holding the deed were to decide to ignore his agreement with Krauss...and sell the mansion to a third party right this moment, they would have no recourse whatsoever. `
`Far from using collateral for a loan, this was basically the same as selling their house to borrow money... `
`"...In other words, ...the moneylenders have the power to make or break the Ushiromiya family as they please. `
`If they were to suddenly sell our house on some slight whim, `
`......we'd have to pack our bags and leave right now, wouldn't we...?" `
`"That is technically true. `
`However, everyone I have had dealings with is very reputable. `
`This isn't consumer financing. `
`It's a transaction based on trust between economically literate men." `
`"I trust them. `
`And they, in turn, trust that by lending me money, I will achieve great success in business and give them massive returns on their investment. `
`I signed over the power of attorney as a sign of good faith and so that they wouldn't have to doubt in the certain success of my business. `
`"What happens if I hesitate now? `
`Wouldn't that mean even I have no confidence in my own business?!" `
`".................." `
`If you were such a successful businessman, we wouldn't be in debt now, would we... `
`...Natsuhi only barely stopped herself from saying that. `
`"...Father is dead. `
`What happens next? `
`Will your debt be exposed to the light of day...and will your siblings hold you responsible?" `
`".........That won't be all. `
`...It will probably lead to criminal charges..." `
`"C-Criminal charges... `
`Wh-Why is that...?" `
`"......It's better if you don't know. `
`...Anyway, ...this must not be learned of by anyone..." `
`"..............." `
`Krauss looked at the floor shamefully, shaking his head over and over... `
`If it would come to criminal charges, ...then he must have broken some laws. `
`He's probably been so intent on raising a large sum of money...that nothing had mattered to him but survival. `
`...Krauss had seriously believed that he would succeed with several businesses...and that he would definitely gain huge profits. `
`So, he had figured that even if he stepped over a few legal lines, he would be able to pay everything back before too long and pretend that the whole thing had never happened. `
`...This may gave been the factor that lessened his resistance towards breaking a couple laws. `
`And now Kinzo's death, the worst possible thing, had occurred, and they wouldn't be able to keep it all hidden for long... `
`"...What will happen to us?" `
`"Th-There is no need to worry... `
`You may not believe it, but conditions are most certainly on the rise now. `
`The value of the city real estate I invested in will rise rapidly. `
`Right now, I am working on a project to integrate those and construct a massive business tower. `
`This will be the most reliable of all my investments so far and will prove to be the most successful." `
`"...However, it will take a little more time for that to bear fruit. `
`It's absolutely certain, but that doesn't mean it will happen now..." `
`"...Will the success of that venture be enough to pay back our debts?" `
`"Of course it will. `
`I'll be able to wipe out all the debt I've accumulated so far...!! `
`So have faith in me. `
`I only need a little more time!" `
`"But Father is already dead! `
`We don't have that kind of time anymore, do we?!" `
`"I know, I know that...!! `
`That's why...I have to obtain money from somewhere and pay off those debts right now! `
`Anyway, I need money... `
`Money, a lot of it, right now!! `
`Aaaaaaaaarrrrgghhhhhh...!!" `
`As Krauss roared and clutched at his head, he writhed about as if in pain. `
`As she watched, several emotions swirled about in Natsuhi's chest. `
`Her emotions conflicted as she felt pity for her husband...while also feeling that he was a fool. `
`...And, she felt a mixture of resentment and regret towards her own irresponsibility in letting her husband run wild for so long. `
`Even if this day hadn't come, it should have been clear that they were in a very critical situation. `
`And yet he had carelessly waited for this moment to come...and was now writhing about. `
`...Her husband was so foolish...and so pitiful. `
`It would be easy to let herself get fed up with this. `
`...However, she was his wife. `
`For a wife, ridiculing her husband as a fool would run in conflict with her responsibilities. `
`...If he was a fool, then she would have to support him enough to compensate... `
`However, she didn't have a clue what she should do... `
`Since there had been such a massive amount of money within arm's reach, `
`it was only natural that Krauss had tried to dip his hands into it... `
`It would also be easy to tell him to be a man and give up on all of it. `
`But that would also run in conflict with her responsibilities. `
`She was Ushiromiya Natsuhi. `
`...The woman who had become Krauss's wife and sworn to support him, the new Head of the Ushiromiya family, for her whole life. `
`She had to somehow help her husband in his efforts to raise money. `
`...She understood it logically. `
`But she couldn't suppress the indescribable dejection that seemed to rise up from the dark depths of her heart... `
`"That's right, F-Father's hidden gold...! `
`10 tons of gold is worth 20 billion yen! `
`If I had that... `
`that's right, if I had that, all our problems would be solved...!" `
`"Natsuhi, that's it! The witch's epitaph! `
`Let's solve that, let's solve it together! `
`If we can just find the gold, everything will work itself out!! `
`That's right, it must be hidden somewhere on this island!! `
`If we had that, if we had that...!!" `
`"Th-That hurts... `
`dear, `
`...p-please stop it..." `
`Krauss, acting as excited as if he'd thought up a perfect, brilliant plan, grasped Natsuhi's upper arms tightly. `
`Natsuhi couldn't help but be dumbfounded. `
`She wasn't just taken aback because she'd heard him bring up something as fake-sounding as the hidden gold. `
`This was Krauss, who usually mocked the story of the hidden gold, `
`saying that it didn't exist and that it was all an illusion his father had created to borrow a lot of money. `
`That was why Natsuhi was doubly taken aback... `
`"Yes, let's have Jessica help us too. `
`Maybe some things can only be solved with a child's sensitivity! `
`This is a family crisis. `
`All of us have to stick together!! `
`Yes, it's a fanciful riddle that Father created...!! `
`We should be able to solve it, ...and there's no reason we wouldn't be able solve it...! `
`It's the only way!!" `
`"Oh, Natsuhi, this is wonderful, `
`we still have an option left, and right here next to us!! `
`The gold is on this island!! `
`If we had it, every one of our problems would be solved! `
`Waha, wahahahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`Natsuhi, call Jessica here right away! `
`Let's overcome this family crisis together!! `
`Yes, right now!! `
`The gold is on this island, it's right beside us!! `
`...Wah!!" `
`Unable to withstand the pain in the arm he was twisting in his excitement, Natsuhi knocked Krauss aside. `
`Krauss tripped over the edge of the bed and flopped over onto the floor... `
`"P-Please get ahold of yourself!! `
`And please calm down...!! `
`Do you really think that this Ushiromiya family crisis...could be solved by something as dream-like as that...?!!" `
`"......N-Natsuhi......" `
`"Please, cool your head and think of a realistic plan to gather money...!! `
`I'm going to go cool my head as well...!" `
`"...Wait, ...Natsuhi..." `
`Maybe he had come to his senses the instant he fell over. `
`Krauss tried to tell Natsuhi to stop, but she just kept walking. `
`After closing the door forcefully, Natsuhi dashed away... `
`Natsuhi ran through the corridor. `
`Even though she didn't want anyone to see her like this, she ran headlong into Genji... `
`"...My deepest apologies. `
`Madam, have you been injured...?" `
`"I-I'm fine. `
`Leave me alone...!!" `
`"......Certainly." `
`"Oh, ...Genji. `
`...How are things going in Father's study?" `
`"...It is just as you left it. `
`Although Doctor Nanjo is in the parlor." `
`"Is that so...? `
`...Do you have the key to the study?" `
`"Yes. `
`Right here." `
`"Give it to me. `
`...Let me have some time alone with Father. `
`If my husband asks where I am, tell him you don't know." `
`"...Certainly." `
`After grabbing the key to the study that Genji was holding out to her, Natsuhi rushed up the stairs. `
`She then flew into the study, `
`...finally let out a wail, ...and cried. `
`"......Father...... `
`Please forgive our foolishness...!! `
`My husband and I... `
`...aren't capable of inheriting all that you created...! `
`Please, ...please, `
`.........forgive us for our foolishness and our crimes... `
`And, `
`...if you can forgive us, `
`......please guide the way for us fools......" `
`Clinging to Kinzo as he slept in the bed, Natsuhi cried even harder. `
`She kept imagining Kinzo sitting up suddenly and patting her head. `
`No, Father isn't the type of person to pamper... `
`More likely, he'd yell at me to stop being so noisy. `
`......However, neither of these imaginations came true. `
`...Because it was an undeniable fact that Kinzo had entered an eternal sleep. `
`But even so, Natsuhi begged the sleeping Kinzo to forgive and help them... `
`It was still only a few hours after his passing. `
`Perhaps his soul was still here, listening to her. `
`...Believing this, Natsuhi begged for Kinzo's forgiveness and help even more earnestly... `
`{a:c: `
`"Noisy woman. `
`Don't I always say that I value silence?"} `
`"......Huh-" `
`That voice made Natsuhi jump up in surprise. `
`When she faced in the direction that the voice had come from, .........she saw Kinzo sitting at the study desk, folding up his reading glasses... `
`"Did you get in a fight with Krauss again? `
`...Neglecting his wife like that... That Krauss only inherited my bad traits." `
`"...F-Father..." `
`"...What a wretched-looking face. `
`Wash it. `
`Aren't you the wife of the Successor of the Ushiromiya family? `
`You mustn't let the servants see you wear such a shameful expression." `
`"...Y-Yes, Father... `
`...My apologies..." `
`...Natsuhi understood. `
`This was just an illusion, ...one that Natsuhi had created out of her desire to speak with a memory of Kinzo as he once was. `
`No, that wasn't it... `
`...She believed that just for now, Kinzo's soul had shown itself to her. `
`She was sure that doubting this would cause it to vanish in an instant... `
`"It seems that at the instant the family Headship was passed on, the family has reached a crisis..." `
`"...Y-Yes, Father... `
`I wasn't able to support my husband... `
`...I am truly...very sorry......" `
`"Hmph. `
`The Ushiromiya family is so very cursed. `
`It was in a terrible state when I succeeded the Headship too. `
`That makes your suffering seem almost cute in comparison." `
`Kinzo's succession to the Family Headship had come suddenly. `
`At the time, he had been nothing more than a single young man from a branch family, far separated from the Ushiromiya main family. `
`The main family might have had honor and tradition, but Kinzo had had nothing to do with that. `
`Then, the principal members of the main family were wiped out in the Great Kanto Earthquake, along with their businesses. `
`On top of that, there had been a complicated antagonism between the members of the family at the time, `
`and the elders had all tried to impose their will on the others in that sinking ship. `
`Because of this, they weren't even able to elect a leader to revive the Ushiromiya family. `
`They then found a common ground and selected Kinzo, a youth with absolutely no ties to any of the opposing elders, to be the Head. `
`So the elders hadn't really entrusted Kinzo with the rebuilding of the Ushiromiya family. `
`Kinzo had been nothing more than their puppet, with his arms and legs pulled in opposite directions... `
`"......Yes. `
`...I know a lot about your days of suffering, Father." `
`"And then, the war started. `
`At the time, I was already tired of life. `
`I hoped I would die on the battlefield, but I wasn't sent to the front lines. `
`...However, the state of the war grew worse with every day, and the time for the decisive battle on the Japanese mainland seemed to grow ever closer. `
`As terrible as it may sound, I prayed for that day to come quickly..." `
`After listening to the approaching footsteps of that reaper day in and day out, `
`...it is said that Kinzo started cutting his ties with this world one by one. `
`And then, on that day when he had severed all his regrets, when he reached a state of enlightenment... `
`It is said that he had a mystical experience. `
`...It is said that he met her. `
`The Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}... `
`"I made a contract with the witch and was given the power of gold and madness. `
`...On that day, the old me died, and a new me possessing the insane power of magic was born." `
`"...I know. `
`And after the war, `
`you used your ingenious cunning to revive the Ushiromiya family." `
`The now-deceased elders who knew Kinzo at the time... `
`had whispered to each other that Kinzo must have bumped his head on the battlefield and returned with a different personality... `
`That was how much Kinzo had stood out after the war. `
`Whether the story about Kinzo meeting a witch was true or not, `
`there could be no doubt that the extraordinary experience of war had prepared him for death...and let him reach a state of enlightenment. `
`If he wanted to describe the mystical experience following all that as a meeting with a witch, that claim certainly shouldn't be dismissed out of hand... `
`"...That's right. `
`...You returned from the war, `
`conquered the witch {f:5:Beatrice}, and became the Head of the Ushiromiya family in the truest sense..." `
`"Correct. `
`Before I met {f:5:Beatrice}, I was nothing more than a puppet, only the Head in name. `
`......I only became the Head after conquering the Golden Witch." `
`"...Father... `
`Umm, ...will this Golden Witch aid my husband Krauss, now that he's the new Head...?" `
`"Oh, she will. `
`Assuming that he has truly succeeded the Headship." `
`"Wh-What do you mean by "truly succeeded"...?" `
`"I mean it depends on whether he bears the responsibility and pride of the Ushiromiya Family Head in the truest sense. `
`...Natsuhi, you should understand this. `
`The Headship is not inherited by blood. `
`It is inherited through spirit and conviction. `
`......Even though Krauss is my eldest son, he cannot be called the true Head if he does not possess these things!" `
`"And, if that spirit were to dwell in a human, even someone other than Krauss, they would make a splendid new Head. `
`{f:5:Beatrice} will lend her power to that true Head. `
`......Isn't that right, {f:5:Beatrice}?!!" `
`When Kinzo called the witch's name, ...gold butterflies seethed out of every corner of the room. `
`This fantastical scene had an otherworldly beauty to it. `
`It was like standing in the midst of a blizzard of golden flower petals being blown about a rose garden of gold. `
`As Natsuhi stared at this scene in shock, the gold butterflies gathered and formed a human shape... `
`Then, ...the witch of the portrait appeared... `
`"Indeed. `
`I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`...I am free to run rampant! `
`I listen to no one's orders." `
`"And there's only one person in the world who can control her. `
`Me. `
`...That is why I am qualified to be the Ushiromiya Family Head." `
`"Hmph. `
`So, it's that pride of yours that qualifies you?" `
`"Pride requires self-confidence and bravery. `
`And, it is the embodiment of the insatiable desire to gain power to match those traits. `
`...That is why I control you." `
`"......Watching men who speak of pride turn those desires into reality can be quite pleasant. `
`The "quiet man of action" is nothing more than an excuse used by the extremely lucky. `
`...A true monarch also speaks of what he doesn't have. `
`And he makes that pride a reality without fail. `
`......If one is to control me, they must possess such a monarch's pride." `
`"Do you understand, Natsuhi? `
`A true monarch fears no hardship. `
`They declare that they will overcome anything without fail. `
`Even if they haven't yet figured out how. `
`This gives hope to the weak. `
`They gather, revere the monarch, and swear to assist him. `
`This is where power is gained and his word is carried out. `
`Engrave that into your heart." `
`"......Y-Yes, Father..." `
`Natsuhi understood. `
`Through this mystical experience, ...Kinzo was telling her how to prepare herself to overcome hardship. `
`...Even after his own death. `
`Feeling a warm sensation rise up in her chest, she let the valuable words Kinzo had given her echo through her mind over and over. `
`...A true monarch... `
`In other words, `
`the true Head of the Ushiromiya family...must not fear hardship. `
`Such a person must believe they can overcome any hardship... `
`If they can't even believe it about themselves, then they'll have no chance of overcoming their challenges... `
`...She suddenly felt very ashamed of the way she'd entered this room, `
`...sobbing and asking Kinzo what to do... `
`"I...was foolish..." `
`"............" `
`"...Of course there's no time for crying when an Ushiromiya family crisis is upon us. `
`And now that we have inherited the Ushiromiya family from you, Father, we must protect its honor no matter what." `
`"Hoh. `
`...Even though you can't even draw a blueprint on how to repay Krauss's debts?" `
`{f:5:Beatrice} laughed unpleasantly... `
`...no, that wasn't it. `
`She was testing Natsuhi, to see whether she possessed the mental readiness to be a true monarch. `
`Natsuhi wasn't confused anymore. `
`She answered clearly, gazing into {f:5:Beatrice}'s eyes. `
`"Yes. `
`At this moment, I have not yet discovered the method we should pursue. `
`However, my husband is the new Head of the Ushiromiya family, and I am his supporting wife. `
`So, I will proclaim it in my husband's place." `
`"Let us hear it." `
`"Ushiromiya Krauss and Natsuhi will definitely overcome these trials and protect the honor of the Ushiromiya family. `
`You have nothing to worry about, Father." `
`"...Do you know the scope of Krauss's debt, as well as the horrible state things are in?" `
`"Yes. `
`If the worst happens and we are ordered to leave this mansion tomorrow, we won't be able to refuse. `
`During the distribution of the inheritance, the relatives might even file a criminal complaint." `
`"However, there is no need to worry. `
`We will repay all of the debts before then and restore our honor." `
`As she stood at attention with a resolute attitude, `
`Natsuhi proclaimed this clearly with Ushiromiya Kinzo and {f:5:Beatrice} as witnesses. `
`For a while, `
`they remained silent, as though weighing Natsuhi's resolve. `
`Then Kinzo chuckled and turned away... `
`"...How vexing. `
`...Why couldn't this person have been my son...?" `
`"The very fact that a woman with such a disposition married your son is another sign of your great luck." `
`"......... `
`{f:5:Beatrice}, `
`this is my final order." `
`"Now that you are no longer the Head, I am not obligated to obey your orders." `
`"Hoh. `
`In that case, obey the orders of the new Ushiromiya Family Head." `
`"You are no longer the Head, and Krauss is not yet the Head. `
`Whom are you suggesting that I serve?" `
`"I will leave that to you. `
`It is up to you to decide who is qualified to succeed the Ushiromiya Family Head, and who is fitting to bear the mark of the One-Winged Eagle. `
`...You will ensure that it is so." `
`"I refuse. `
`I won't listen to the orders of a man who isn't the Head." `
`"No, this is different. `
`This is a will. `
`The last order that the Head left behind for you." `
`"...*cackle* `
`Then it seems I will have to obey. `
`After all, I can be quite accommodating." `
`"Liar." `
`"Hoh?" `
`"You're only doing this because it caught your interest, aren't you?" `
`"I can't hide anything from you, can I?" `
`"Natsuhi." `
`"Yes, Father..." `
`"Go and overcome your hardship." `
`"...Y-Yes." `
`That might have seemed like a mere response to Natsuhi, `
`but to Kinzo and {f:5:Beatrice}, it seemed to be something of much greater significance. `
`{f:5:Beatrice} nodded deeply, `
`and with a motion as elegant as her dress, she bowed deeply before Natsuhi... `
`"The Ushiromiya family alchemist, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}, is present. `
`I shall give you my aid to assist the Ushiromiya Family in overcoming another crisis..." `
`"...Thank you. `
`I will need your power. `
`We will most certainly overcome these trials." `
`"I will not hold back on my support for your cause, but there is something I must warn you about beforehand. `
`I understand that your troubles now could be solved if I were to grant you a vast quantity of gold, like I did when I saved Kinzo from his crisis. `
`However, that is something I cannot do." `
`"......Is that so?" `
`"Sorry, Natsuhi. `
`{f:5:Beatrice}'s gold came from a contract limited to my generation. `
`It was agreed that it could only be passed on to another if that person solves the witch's epitaph." `
`"The gold is sealed away by the epitaph. `
`As long as that is not solved, you cannot be given the golden magic." `
`"......I understand. `
`Then I shall search for another method by which we can save ourselves from this crisis. `
`...My husband said his plan would take time, but he also said that it would surely be sufficient to repay our debts. `
`If we can buy enough time for that to happen, we will be able to overcome this trial." `
`"Good, Natsuhi. `
`Continue." `
`"But Kinzo is already dead. `
`The doctor and servants are preparing his funeral. `
`You were about to contact the family members. `
`By your own hand, you will bring an end to this ploy for time. `
`*cackle*cackle* How charming is the guillotine where you lower the blade yourself..." `
`"...............Ah-" `
`Startled, Natsuhi looked up at the ceiling. `
`There wasn't actually anything there. `
`...But even so, Natsuhi had found something. `
`"So, ...the magical power has descended." `
`"Natsuhi, `
`...have you made up your mind? `
`What magic of miracles do you desire from me?" `
`...Once again, all of those who had witnessed Kinzo's corpse were gathered in the study. `
`Krauss was still impatient and clutching at his head. `
`Genji was as expressionless as ever. `
`Nanjo and Kumasawa wore bewildered expressions on their faces. `
`But in stark contrast to all of them, Natsuhi wore a resolute expression. `
`"Dear, let me ask you one more time. `
`Your plan for raising money is absolutely certain?" `
`"......Y-Yes. `
`Give it a year...no, just half a year, and it will certainly bear fruit! `
`But it's just impossible to hope for anything right now..." `
`"Then we will wait." `
`"B-But you said it yourself. `
`...Father is already dead..." `
`"Father has not passed away. `
`He's still there, as healthy as ever." `
`When Natsuhi said this, everyone jumped and looked up. `
`...Because they instantly understood what those words meant... `
`However, Krauss alone didn't get it right away and asked her. `
`"What... `
`do you mean by that...? `
`Father is already... `
`in reality...right there..." `
`"I will say it again. `
`Father is still in good health. `
`He is busy with his research, so he'll be even less able to leave his study than usual. `
`Because of this, we must handle all external affairs ourselves... `
`so that Father can devote himself to his research without being burdened by meaningless tasks." `
`"In short, nothing will change from the way things have been. `
`......Do you understand, Genji?" `
`".........Yes. `
`...The furniture of the One-Winged Eagle will continue to serve the Master." `
`"Kumasawa. `
`And you, Doctor Nanjo. `
`Do you understand what I'm saying?" `
`"...Oh, ...uh, ...ummm..." `
`"...I-Is that truly all right, Natsuhi-san...?" `
`"It may be true that Father passed away today, `
`but if everyone right here, right now believes, we can revive Father with magic." `
`"I-It's impossible, Madam... `
`That's just too much...!" `
`"The time of death will be made clear during the autopsy. `
`We can't stop it from looking suspicious...!" `
`"Father will not pass away, so there will be no reason for there to be an autopsy." `
`Of course, she wasn't planning to make it seem like Kinzo would live forever. `
`The fake life given to Kinzo would only last until Krauss could repay his debts. `
`After that, Kinzo's soul would finally be able to rest in peace. `
`Nanjo repeatedly said that the time of death would be discovered during the autopsy, but Natsuhi kept saying that this wouldn't be a problem. `
`"Father will not pass away by being reported dead." `
`"...A-Ah, I see. `
`...He'll be reported missing...!!" `
`After clapping his hands together, Krauss stood up, shaking his fists. `
`"Yes. `
`Once we've managed to pay back the debt and finish our preparations for laying Father to rest, we will then announce that Father has disappeared." `
`Rokkenjima's vast, uncultivated forest was the perfect place to stage a disappearance. `
`One day, Kinzo would go out to the forest for a walk and never return. `
`...They would search for him without success and then be forced to report his disappearance... `
`"If he disappears, we can file a report of his death even without a corpse. `
`In other words, we can hide him long enough to have him declared legally dead! `
`What do you think, Doctor Nanjo?! `
`There won't be any problems that way!" `
`"...Y-Yes, that might work..." `
`"...Is this really okay, Madam...? `
`If we stay silent, then I'm sure we could keep the Master's death a secret...! `
`However, if we were to slip up even once and let someone find out...!!" `
`"Kumasawa, `
`don't be so loud. `
`...Father is sleeping right over there, correct? `
`Are you trying to wake him?" `
`It isn't a corpse. `
`...Kinzo...is sleeping. `
`As Natsuhi said that, `
`...Kinzo lay quietly on the bed as though there was nothing at all odd about her words. `
`"Come, try to remember. `
`What form did you have? `
`What sort of life did you enjoy?!" `
`Once again, a storm of gold butterflies started to swirl, covering Kinzo's cold body... `
`Then, after the butterflies exploded into fine gold powder and disappeared, `
`......just like those fairy tales that have been told over and over since long ago, ...Kinzo slowly opened his eyes and sat up... `
`"......F-Father...!!" `
`"...Natsuhi, `
`let me first make one thing clear. `
`I did not coax you into doing this because of my attachment to life." `
`"You liar. `
`Don't tell me you didn't anticipate this at least a little. `
`How does it feel, Kinzo? `
`How is your body?" `
`"It isn't bad, but it feels somewhat like being in a dream. `
`I feel light." `
`"You're a being that wasn't permitted to remain in this world, yet you still remain here. `
`Don't start complaining about a little discomfort now." `
`"...Is your body truly all right?! `
`Is it really...okay...?!" `
`"Hmmm. `
`Actually, it feels quite pleasant. `
`...If this is what the world after death feels like, playing the ghost might not be half bad." `
`"How is this, Natsuhi? `
`Kinzo has revived. `
`That means a funeral is unnecessary. `
`Your hardship has been resolved!" `
`"...B-{f:5:Beatrice}..." `
`As Natsuhi tried to find words of gratitude amidst her confusion, `
`{f:5:Beatrice} waggled her pointer finger and spoke. `
`"There is no need for thanks. `
`A ruler is allowed to be proud. `
`I will not pay heed to requests, but I will follow orders." `
`"Even so, I'll say it. `
`...Thank you. `
`This way, ...you've bought some time for my husband... `
`...We will handle the rest." `
`"Be warned, Natsuhi. `
`Kinzo may have revived, but that is not an eternal thing. `
`It will only continue as long as my magic does. `
`...Be warned that the magic-resisting toxin might destroy the magic. `
`You must understand the laws of magic correctly and work hard to maintain it. `
`I can show you a miracle, but it is your role to grasp it and hold it." `
`"Of course. `
`We definitely won't neglect the miracle you have given us." `
`"Very well. `
`...Yes, it would appear masters need to be changed out every once in a while, just like floor mats. `
`*cackle*cackle*! `
`I like it. `
`I shall serve you, `
`Ushiromiya Natsuhi! `
`I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}...!! `
`Call my name whenever you wish. I shall appear and grant you a miracle." `
`"Thank you. `
`I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi. `
`I will employ you and protect the honor of the Ushiromiya family...!!" `
