`"...Erika, Dlanor." `
`"Yes, my master." `
`"You {f:5:called}?" `
`"...I want you two to stay in this Fragment `
`and explain everything in the remaining 1st through 4th games. `
`That pitiful transient witch who supports the Illusion of the Witch no longer exists herself. `
`Expose the naked truth thoroughly." `
`"*giggle*! Leave it to me, my master. `
`There is no riddle that I, Furudo Erika, cannot solve." `
`"...Of course. `
`That's why you're my piece, my double. `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*!" `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} wore a massive...and horrible smile, which Erika shared. `
`...{f:5:Beatrice}'s Illusion of the Witch would disappear, `
`and the results in all of the previous games would be painted over. `
`It had been crushed in every way possible, ...and only the naked truth remained. `
`Such a weak truth was no better than fish on the chopping board for Erika... `
`"It is possible to explain all of the past four games with Natsuhi as the criminal, `
`or with certain irregularities based off that theme. `
`I won't let anyone say it's the crime of the witch {f:5:Beatrice} again. `
`I'll start compiling it together at once, and then present a first-rate tale to you." `
`"*giggle*... `
`You mustn't leave even a single Fragment of Beato's Legend of the Witch behind. `
`The rumors among the servants, the way people talked about unexplained events as though that legend was the cause, `
`the Illusion of the Witch that worked alongside the illusion of Kinzo... `
`...Deal with all of them completely." `
`"Of course. `
`I'll get to it right away. `
`...We now have the furniture in custody. `
`We're hurrying to identify their vessels." `
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory had already been taken into custody. `
`Those noisy sisters who had served Beato now faced nothing but denial. `
`What sort of illusion were they based upon that allowed them to "manifest"? `
`...Everything would be exposed... `
`and denied. `
`"Eiserne Jungfrau has already begun its {f:5:investigation}. `
`According to the most recent results, there is a high probability that they were constructed during the 1960's in the vicinity of New York. `
`An aide has already been sent to the {f:5:location}." `
`"The 1960's? The Seven Sisters of Purgatory are <Made in USA>? `
`Pfft, *giggle*giggle*giggle*... `
`Even though they bragged about being furniture connected with King Solomon and serving a thousand-year-old witch, they're a total sham. `
`Who was it...?" `
`"According to the report, ... `
`there's this group of big-time swindlers who make money by selling fakes to rich fans of the occult." `
`"Because the deceived millionaires try to resell the fakes as though they were real, `
`there's a chance that they've been falsely deified by enthusiasts in the {f:5:field}. `
`We are rushing to find confirmation and further {f:5:details}." `
`"So Ushiromiya Kinzo was a sucker who'd pay big bucks for any fake occult object." `
`"...*giggle*giggle*, ...ahahahahahahahaha...!! `
`And that's what the Seven Sisters of Purgatory really are...? `
`That's hilarious, `
`ahahahahahhhahahahahhahahahha!! `
`A total sham, just like Beato's Illusion of the Witch." `
`"Though they call themselves the seven deadly sins, they're actually cheap, fake souvenirs. `
`...Well, from the very beginning, `
`I figured they were nothing more than paperweights sold at some shady souvenir shop." `
`"*giggle*giggle*!! Paperweights...! `
`Ahhahhahhahahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`Have you confronted the Seven Sisters with that truth yet?" `
`"No, not {f:5:yet}." `
`"They still seriously believe they were created `
`by a great sorcerer over a thousand years ago. `
`...I'd like to confront them with perfect evidence and the truth right away... `
`and let them know that they're mere paperweights worth less than 30 US dollars." `
`"When you do, I wonder what their faces will look like...as they lose all hope. `
`...*giggle* I can't wait. `
`Call for me when that happens. `
`I'll come to watch, with some of the best black tea and dried plums." `
`Beato's Illusion of the Witch had already been penetrated, `
`and it's been proven that everything was simply the result of Human delusions. `
`What kind of delusions created them, and what caused these in the first place? `
`When the answers were proven perfectly and shoved in the faces of those concerned... `
`...The illusion would vanish and be completely annihilated. `
`This is what they meant...by "execution". `
`"...An execution is not a {f:5:show}. `
`As a general rule, it is not made {f:5:public}." `
`"This is an inspection by the Great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, member of the senate, `
`so she can observe that the Great Court is performing its duties satisfactorily. `
`Do you, as a mere Inquisitor of Heresy, wish to deny her this right...?" `
`"Yeah, that's right. `
`I'm just observing as a representative of the senate to make sure you follow the proper procedures when you carry out your work. `
`...*giggle*giggle*giggle*." `
`"We are currently preparing to take {f:5:Virgilia}, Ronove, and Gaap into custody as well. `
`The Chiester Sisters Imperial Guards are conducting that investigation." `
`"...Of course, we will then detain and execute those three connected to {f:5:Beatrice}." `
`"Dlanor, what is the true nature of the Chiester Sisters?" `
`"...We believe there is a high likelihood that their vessels are weapons used in the {f:5:crimes}. `
`For this purpose, Senior Aide Gertrude has formed a special {f:5:team}. `
`We are currently investigating all {f:5:cases}." `
`"I'm looking forward to the Chiester Sisters' execution too...! `
`One at a time? `
`Or all of them at once?" `
`"No one's stupid enough to put an entire can of tea leaves in a pot at once. `
`You've got to enjoy it slowly, one spoonful at a time." `
`"*giggle*giggle*! Exactly. `
`Let's have their executions on consecutive days. `
`For the furniture and the witches, one by one. `
`I'll send you an execution show every day." `
`"Wonderful. `
`...After all, there really are a lot of them. `
`Looks like we'll be able to enjoy ourselves for a full two weeks. `
`...Maybe we can let them decide which ones to execute first. `
`Heheheheheheheheh! `
`Make sure you think up something great for the execution concept. `
`...I'd like to enjoy executions both old and new, from east and west every day." `
`"...The rules state that the method of execution is to follow Great Court {f:5:regulations}." `
`"Leave it to me, my master. `
`I will most certainly prepare you a fascinating execution show!" `
`"Oh, and you'd better quarter at least one of them." `
`"Of course. `
`I shall make a list of the best forms of execution from all countries, from Europe to Asia, `
`which were used by kingdoms east and west for crimes no less than treason against the king!" `
`"...I'd like to think up some execution methods myself. `
`...Pondering that will be the perfect way to relax on those sleepless nights. `
`...*giggle* I'll iron out my ideas and send you a letter soon." `
`"Certainly, my master. `
`Then, we'll have the {f:5:Bernkastel}-style one as the grand finale. `
`...At the very, very end, when all the illusions are broken and Beato's magical compendium has been completely crushed, `
`...I shall present my master with that finest of executions that she desires, ...the execution of {f:5:Beatrice}...!" `
`"Thank you, Erika. `
`...Thanks to you, it seems I'll be able to forget the pain of my illness for a little while... `
`*giggle*giggle*, hehehehehehhahahahahahahahahaha! `
`You're just perfect. `
`My piece, my double, `
`...and my adorable daughter." `
`"...Y-Your words are too good for me...! My master...!!" `
`"Erika, I'll give you honor and a reward. `
`...And that reward is...the greatest symbol of {f:5:Beatrice}, the portrait from the reception hall. `
`Take that off, smash it to make firewood, bake a cake with that and eat it. `
`Then, I'll allow you to put your portrait up in the remaining frame." `
`"...Th-Thank you very much...! `
`It is a great honor...!" `
`"...You will eradicate and erase {f:5:Beatrice}'s name and all traces of her. `
`Until that is all finished, I will order that you be made the master of this sealed-off Rokkenjima." `
`"...By the name of the Witch of Miracles, {f:5:Bernkastel}, `
`I proclaim that you will be given the rank of witch until that day. `
`...From now on, you will call yourself {f:5:Erika}, the Witch of Truth." `
`"...Th- `
`The Witch...of Truth...! `
`...Th- `
`Thank you very much, my master...!! `
`I vow to work even harder so that this honor will not be wasted...!" `
`Even though she was nothing more than a piece, `
`...she was being granted the honor of calling herself a witch like her master, if only for a brief stretch of time... `
`Erika was so moved that her actions had been acknowledged in this greatest form that she trembled... `
`"Dlanor, continue to aid {f:5:Erika} `
`and report on her progress to me." `
`"...As you {f:5:wish}." `
`"......By the way, where's Lambda?" `
`"She is over {f:5:there}." `
`From the guest seating on the second floor, she pointed downwards. `
`{f:5:Lambdadelta}...could be seen beneath Battler, who hung there, dead and pierced by the red longsword. `
`"...Ushiromiya Battler... `
`You were an interesting guy. `
`...And you might've become even more interesting, ...but too bad." `
`"What a wonderful way to die. `
`...{f:5:Erika}! `
`You can hang Battler's corpse in the mansion's reception hall. `
`...The next time I come to visit this Fragment, welcome me in front of it." `
`"Certainly, my master. `
`I'll make that foolish man an eternal monument to my master's victory!" `
`"*giggle* That sounds wonderful. Really tasteful. `
`Maybe you can coat him with plaster and make a beautiful white statue. `
`...And it'd be wonderful if you decorated him all cute!" `
`"Yes, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}. `
`I will strive to answer to your expectations...!" `
`"Congratulations on becoming a witch. `
`Though it'll just be for a while, I'll welcome you as a friend." `
`Erika was so overcome with emotion that tears came to her eyes. `
`...Because for a piece, no greater pleasure exists than having your work acknowledged by your master. `
`"In the end, I'd like to have Beato stuffed too. `
`Then I'll decorate the reception hall with her." `
`"Galaxy Express?" `
`"The one that isn't "Night on the-"." `
`"...You know, `
`I read that back when I wasn't a witch. `
`...I always thought it strange `
`that humans who obtained eternal life would become so cruel. `
`...At the time, I honestly couldn't relate." `
`"...After becoming a witch and living a thousand years, I fully understand it. `
`...That writer could understand our cruelty really well, in the truest sense. `
`*giggle*giggle*!" `
`"...Where'll you go next? `
`I'll bet we say farewell with our backs turned, right?" `
`"That's because I don't want to let you get bored." `
`"Thanks, Bern. `
`But you can be sure I'll count to a hundred and then start searching for you again." `
`"You really don't let a person get bored. `
`That's why I like you, love you. `
`...Let's meet again somewhere. `
`However, we may not be reunited for another hundred or thousand years...if ever." `
`"That's okay. `
`The sea of Fragments is tiny to a pair who love each other." `
`"The Third Man?" `
`"No, Children of Paradise of course." `
`"...If you could escape the poison of just a single evening's worth of boredom... `
`each time you smashed one of those countless Fragments that glitter like a starry night, `
`even you would want to count the stars in the sky." `
`"Ooh, not bad...pfft, *giggle*giggle*...!" `
`The Voyager witches travel across the countless glittering futures of possibility... `
`...and gobble them up, trying to escape their illness called boredom for as long as they can. `
`The tiny, tiny Fragment created by the Human known as {f:5:Beatrice}... `
`...had now been gobbled up by the two witches... `
`...and had lost its glitter. `
`The two who had earlier called themselves rivals in front of Beato... `
`now stopped that charade and laughed together playfully. `
`"{f:5:Erika}, `
`new ruler of this Fragment, `
`...weave the truth, ...and create the tale that leads up to this world's demise. `
`...Umm, the next was the 6th game, right?" `
`"Yes, it's the 6th game." `
`"Decide the title for Episode 6 yourself. `
`After all, you're already the spinner of this tale, as well as the Master." `
`"Thank you very much. `
`...Actually, I've already decided on one." `
`"...Oh, already? `
`...Then let me hear it. `
`What kind of title is it?" `
`"Yes. `
`Episode 6, ... `
`Heheheheh, I'd really like to leave you hanging for a bit, but I'll tell you." `
`"*giggle*! `
`Come on, stop being a smartass and tell us. `
`A newbie witch like you shouldn't be teasing your seniors!" `
`"Episode 6: Checkmate of the Golden Witch!" `
