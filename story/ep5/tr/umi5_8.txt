`......Battler did nothing but gaze lazily out the window.`
`The fighting between the relatives continued without end......`
`At first, the relatives had crowded around the study.`
`However, no matter how much they knocked, the master of the study did not answer even once.`
`Eva and several others said that they should open the door with the second key, the one Genji held.`
`However, in a flash of brilliance, Natsuhi said that Kinzo had been in a particularly bad mood and had taken back the key he'd previously given Genji,`
` meaning that he now had both keys himself.`
` She claimed that it was therefore impossible for them to open the door.`
`After she promised to let them meet Kinzo tomorrow morning no matter what, they finally returned to the dining hall.`
`But, of course, the argument continued on even after they returned there.`
`Eva's group wanted a lot of cash very soon, and they were trying to threaten Krauss somehow and make him pay up.`
`......Apparently, Battler's solving of the epitaph, which threatened Krauss's position as the next head,`
` had given the others a huge tailwind.`
`On the other side, Krauss and Natsuhi denied the very basis of their argument,`
` claiming that it had never been specified that ownership of the gold would be handed over to the person who solved the epitaph.`
`They asserted that it hadn't been hidden gold, but just Kinzo's stockpile,`
` and it was still Kinzo's property, which meant it was only natural for it to be distributed after Kinzo's death with the rest of the inheritance.`
`After hearing this, Eva's group once again started demanding that they be allowed to see Kinzo.`
`......It had probably been clear as day from the beginning.`
`{n}This sibling fight could only be settled by Kinzo...`
`It was obvious that this confrontation was between Eva's group, which wanted cash fast,`
` and Krauss, who was hiding his lack of funds but still didn't need money right away.`
`As Battler listened vaguely to this exchange,`
` ......he marveled at how, despite their usual affluent airs, they were all surprisingly deep in debt...`
`"Didn't you already say that a short while ago?`
` That's enough, let's take a break.`
` We're all repeating the same things over and over again."`
`According to the clock, it was almost midnight.`
`It certainly was a perfect time for a break.`
`The atmosphere relaxed just a bit...`
`"I agree.`
` It'd do both sides some good to take a breather.`
` ...Listen, why don't we take a record down for the rest.`
` I've had enough of fighting over what was or wasn't said."`
`"Seriously.`
` We really can't do without a record of proceedings, not when Nii‐san can so easily deny something he's said before the words stop bouncing off the walls."`
`"With a written record, just writing it would be a pain, and it'd be open to forgery."`
`"Right.`
` ......Aniki, does this thing work?"`
`"The tape set?`
` ...I see.`
` This way, we can keep a record without bothering to write it down, and forgery will be impossible.`
` It's fair for both sides."`
`"Make sure you don't mess anything up...!`
` Those are Father's precious music tapes!"`
`The dignified tape set had a sense of weight to it which matched this majestic dining hall perfectly.`
`On pleasant Sunday mornings, it would sometimes be used to play famous tapes or records.`
`However, right now, it was the most neutral and impartial conference record keeper around...`
`Rudolf fished randomly around the cassette rack, searching for a blank tape.`
`And every time he found some tape with "sophisticated" music, he would chuckle at how pompous it was.`
`"Excuse me.`
` ......You called?"`
`"We're taking a break.`
` Sorry, but could you make us something to drink?`
` And maybe some biscuits would be nice too."`
`"Certainly.`
` I will prepare it right away......"`
`"Also, ......sorry.`
` Do you have any cold medicine?`
` I've been feeling a bit feverish."`
`"Then don't overstrain yourself.`
` Get some sleep."`
`"If you really feel like it, why not get some sleep, Rosa?`
` Though I wouldn't step out of such an important conference because of a simple cold."`
`"Really?`
` I would excuse myself without hesitation.`
` Natsuhi, why don't we take a short rest too?"`
`"............Yes, dear."`
`Sensing that he meant to have a strategy meeting, Natsuhi stood up.`
`......Even if that wasn't the case, she was so desperate to get out of the room even for a moment that she'd have taken any excuse.`
`Krauss and Natsuhi left the dining hall, ......and the tension in the room truly relaxed.`
`"............Phew."`
`"You've been doing great, Battler‐kun.`
` ......I imagine you feel just horrible.`
` Think of this as part of growing up and just accept it."`
`"Just how long am I going to have to sit around doing nothing here?"`
`"......Who knows.`
` After all, you're like our personal donation box.`
` ......Sleepy?"`
`"About the same as Japanese Lit class."`
`"I'm pretty sure Father won't show up tonight anyway.`
` When Krauss nii‐san and the rest come back, I'll propose that we might as well let you go."`
`"......I'd appreciate that."`
`Tap‐tap.`
`A light knock and the faint sound of china clinking together could be heard.`
`"Excuse us......"`
`"We have brought tea."`
`Shannon and Kanon had come by with a serving cart.`
`The pleasant smell of black tea relieved their tension all the more.`
`"......Hey.`
` Did you hear?"`
`"What are you talking about......?"`
`"............We didn't hear anything."`
`"Stop it, Rudolf.`
` There's no reason to tell them."`
`"......We are furniture,`
` so we have no interest in the family conference."`
`"I see.`
` That's a wise answer."`
`"......You have the midnight shift?`
` That must be tough."`
`"That is our job.`
` ......We would be happy to receive your orders."`
`"You could be right there.`
` It'd probably be even more tiresome to sit around awake doing nothing.`
` When I was still down in the bottom rungs, I once worked as a warehouse keeper.`
` Even if you're just staying awake, it's still pretty tough...!`
` Right after the war, you had robbers all over the place.`
` Plus you couldn't rely on the police back then, so it was a pretty dangerous time...!"`
`Hideyoshi was particularly proud of how he had started with nothing and built up assets by diverting goods from the American army.`
`Once the subject came up, Hideyoshi tended to get pretty talkative.`
`The relatives knew this and were greatly relieved to see that a perfect sacrifice had come up.`
`"If you got found out, you were in for it big time!`
` Those Yanks are scary!`
` Their strength's in another league 'cause of all that beef they eat.`
` Get caught and that'd be the end of ya! Firin' squad or <death by hanging>!"`
`"You know that one? <Death by hanging>!`
` Oh yeah, and then, I figured it out.`
` It's all about the meat! The meat!`
` Japanese people've gotta eat more meat!`
` And that's when I had the revelation—I had to start up a business to capture people's stomachs!"`
`"I, ...I see...`
` That m‐must have been quite a difficult task......"`
`"Stop it, darling.`
` No matter how much you tell people born after the war, they'll never understand how hard it was back then."`
`"Oops, looks like my bad habit's jumped out again...!`
` Sorry, sorry!`
` Waha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!"`
`"You two should have some tea as well.`
` I think it might help you if once in a while you used your own mouths to learn more about the tea you're brewing."`
`".........No, we'll be fine.`
` There's no need to be concerned for our sakes..."`
`"Hang out with us for a bit.`
` Being surrounded by only adults makes me feel like I'm gonna suffocate."`
`"Hear that? That's an order from Battler‐sama, successor to the head!`
` Sit over there and have some tea with us.`
` And tell us about what's been going on recently, your hobbies, TV shows you're watching, and whatever it is that's popular with young folks these days.`
` There's a lot we could learn."`
`"*giggle*.`
` That's a brilliant idea.`
` Come on, sit down, both of you.`
` And become our sacrifices now that we're starved of things to talk about."`
`"Wahahahahahaha.`
` That's right.`
` The only way I'm gettin' to talk to young folk at this age is goin' to a cabaret club."`
`"......How long are you planning on standing around there?`
` Rudolf told you to sit.`
` Go on, sit down.`
` ......I give you permission as well."`
`After getting Eva's permission, Shannon and Kanon looked at each other and finally obeyed, nervously.`
`For a while, the two were pounded by questions and became the relatives' playthings......`
`Tap‐tap.`
` Another reserved knock could be heard.`
`All of the servants tended to knock in a similar manner,`
` so no one noticed anything strange.`
`However, Shannon and Kanon turned around with surprised looks on their faces.`
`......The servants here today included the two of them, Genji, Kumasawa, and Gohda.`
`Gohda had the midnight shift at the guesthouse.`
`{n}Kumasawa had gone to bed in the servants' quarters in the guesthouse.`
`And they were in here, ......so Genji was the only person left,`
` ...but they knew very well that Genji wouldn't knock like that......`
`"......Who is it?`
` It's not locked. Just come in."`
`Rudolf didn't recognize the knock either.`
`And when he asked "Who is it?", everyone came to the same realization that they too had no idea who would knock like that......`
`After that, the same knock repeated just once more.`
`......Could it be that someone had their hands full...and was asking that the door be opened for them...?`
`As a slightly odd feeling began to encompass the room, the sound of the large clock in the hall could be heard.`
`It was the sign that October 4th had ended and October 5th had begun......`
`A short while earlier—`
`Krauss and Natsuhi were well away from the dining hall, in a deserted corridor on the second floor......`
`".........So, we no longer have any other options."`
`"Yes...`
` ......I do not think the same trick will work again tomorrow.`
` ...If we hesitate any longer, there's a chance that Eva‐san and the others will claim that we have Father locked up and call the police.`
` This is......as far as we can go."`
`"................................."`
`"......Battler‐kun finding the gold......was completely unexpected.`
` If only that hadn't happened, I'd thought of a plan which might have managed to get us through this somehow......"`
`"......Hmph.`
` Just like every other bet I've made.`
` ...Something unexpected always arises, and the "guaranteed" outcome is thrown off course."`
`".........We'll have Father's room be empty starting tomorrow morning.`
` Let's plan it out with Genji and have him say that he saw Father heading out into the forest early in the morning."`
`"I doubt Eva and the others will swallow that story of his disappearance..."`
`"I'm fully aware of that.`
` However, we have no other options...!"`
`"If we do such a thing, ......Eva and the others will doubtless make a fuss about it being suspicious.`
` They aren't worried about appearances as long as they can squeeze some money out of us.`
` ...They might strike a deal with some odd magazine and cause serious damage to the confidence placed in me."`
`"We can live with {i:damage}...!`
` If by any chance Father's secret is discovered, it won't be a matter of mere damage...!!"`
`"There's nothing wrong with persisting until the last second tomorrow.`
` If we're able to make it through safely, we won't have to lose anything.`
` There's no need to get impatient and use up our trump card...!"`
`"You want to wait until after they start accusing us of locking Father up, and {i:then} reply that he's gone missing?`
` That is far more likely to draw suspicion...!!"`
`"........................nnnn......"`
`"......Let's just...`
`put Father to rest now...`
` To go any further...`
`......would be impossible......"`
`"Calm yourself.`
` You've just had too much exposure to the toxin from Eva and the others and have lost your composure.`
` ......Only two keys exist which can let anyone into that study!`
` And you have both of them right here.`
` That means no one can go inside.`
` That door is of a very special make.`
` No matter what kind of tools they bring out of the storehouse, it won't even budge."`
`"It isn't a physical problem like that...!"`
`"Look, stop panicking, settle down.`
` If you like, you can pretend to have gotten a fever and stay in bed.`
` In the meantime, I will overcome all of this."`
`"......I can't leave everything to you...!`
` I'll fight until the end too...!"`
`When Natsuhi could no longer hold back the tears brought on by her fierce emotions, ......Krauss held her gently.`
`......Just how long had it been since she'd last felt warmth from her husband's embrace......`
`"Your headache.........is killing you, isn't it?`
` Whenever you get those creases between your eyebrows, I can tell."`
`"............Dear......"`
`She had come to think that her husband could never understand the way she felt.`
`But, ......when it came to times like this.........`
`"......Let's wait for the very last moment before using our disappearance trump card.`
` It's like a last‐resort treasured sword:`
` it's best when it remains in its sheath.`
` The important thing is being ready to pull it out at any time, wouldn't you agree...?"`
`"I......understand that..."`
`"Why don't you leave that trump card with me?`
` .........Of course, at the final moment, I will take all of the responsibility.`
` ......I won't get you and Jessica involved."`
`"What...do you mean by that...?!"`
`"If the Ushiromiya family is destroyed, it is enough that I alone am crushed under the rubble.`
` .........After the typhoon passes, I will prepare divorce forms.`
` I will sign the papers for you to keep and use when you please.`
` ......I have some assets hidden away in your name.`
` Add on the settlement, and it should be enough for you and Jessica to live in comfort."`
`"No!!`
` Ushiromiya Natsuhi is the name that should be engraved on my tombstone...!`
` Please let me be with you until the last moment...!`
` Even if it turns out that you are the last head of the Ushiromiya family,`
` ......please let Natsuhi...`
`...be the name of his wife...`
`...your wife......"`
`......Krauss's existence was based solely upon the power of his assets and his trustworthiness as a financial fixer.`
`If those were both undermined, nothing would remain.`
`Using the trump card of Kinzo's disappearance would mean losing one of these two essential supports.`
`......It was like offering your right arm to save your head from being cut off.`
`It was probably better than losing your head, but you still might die from the blood loss,`
` and even on the off‐chance that you did survive, you would have to bear a heavy wound that wouldn't heal for the rest of your life......`
`Krauss was prepared even for death......`
`Natsuhi understood this,`
` ......buried her face in Krauss's chest,`
` ...and cried...`
`"............My apologies for interrupting."`
`Genji's sudden voice made Natsuhi jump back and hurriedly wipe the tears from her eyes.`
`Krauss stood in front of Natsuhi, shielding her.`
`"Ah, Genji‐san.`
` Please don't sneak up on us.`
` ......Do you have some business?"`
`".........Yes.`
` My apologies, but I have something to report to Madam."`
`"To......me......?`
` Dear......"`
`"I don't mind."`
`Krauss left Natsuhi's side, went to a window a short way off,`
` and gazed at the windy and rainy rose garden......`
`Natsuhi went with Genji to a place a short distance away.`
`"......What is it?"`
`".........Well...`
` The truth is, another phone call has come for you, Madam."`
`At that moment, she was surprised by a sudden, eerie sound.`
`{n}It was the large clock in the hall announcing midnight...`
`"You don't mean............that man......again...?"`
`".........Yes.`
` ......What is to be done?"`
`"D‐......did he say what business he had with me?"`
`".........He would not answer.`
` He kept insisting that he wanted to speak to you directly."`
`".............................."`
`Again, ...a phone call......from the man who claimed to be taking revenge for what had happened 19 years ago.`
`19 years ago.`
`......That was just one year before Jessica and Battler were born.`
`In Natsuhi's eyes, the gap between 19 years ago and 18 years ago was immense.`
`......For a long time, she was unable to fulfill her role of creating a successor for the Ushiromiya family...and was treated very coldly.`
`But then, she finally gave birth to Jessica...`
`and became able to call herself the wife to the Ushiromiya successor with her head held high.`
`......So in her eyes, "Ushiromiya Natsuhi" began 18 years ago.`
`......So everything before that, including 19 years ago......contained nothing but hateful memories.`
`The last year of that hateful period.........was whispering of revenge...from the other end of the phone......`
`.........Once again......she heard the roar of the sea......`
`....................................`
`".........What is to be done?"`
`"Transfer it......to my room.`
` ......Don't let my husband know."`
`"......As you wish."`
`From the very beginning, Genji had understood that she wouldn't want Krauss hearing about this phone call.`
`That was why he had told Natsuhi covertly......`
`Natsuhi ordered that he transfer the call, told Krauss that she would turn in for the night, and left at a quick pace......`
`She returned to her room and locked the door.`
`...There's nothing peculiar about that.`
`{n}......In the Ushiromiya family, hallways are like public roads.`
`{n}There's no special meaning in locking the door when you enter your own room...`
`...This is what she told herself.`
`Then, as though it had been waiting for her, the telephone rang.`
`{n}...Genji must have transferred the call.`
`She took a deep breath, readied herself, ............and picked up the receiver.`
`"............Hello........."`
`".............................."`
`Again, ......it started with silence.`
`She realized that the person at the other end was trying to keep her in suspense and make her feel uncomfortable, and she got angry...`
`"Why are you silent...?!`
` I'm hanging up...!"`
`"...Hahahahahahaha...`
` ......Don't hang up, Mother.`
` I want to hear your voice a little longer......"`
`Again......that unpleasant voice......`
`"Are you trying to mock me...?!`
` State your business...!"`
`"I want to play with you, Mother."`
`"...Wh‐......what?`
` What are you talking about?!`
` I have no desire to play with you...!!"`
`"......You're tired from the family conference, right?`
` I'll bet that chronic headache of yours is giving you a bad time."`
`"Th‐that's none of your business...!"`
`Just the fact that he knew her headache was troubling her made a shiver run up her spine...`
`"You get headaches because your head's all stiff.`
` You won't have pleasant dreams if you go straight to bed like that."`
`"Haven't I told you that's none of your business?!!`
` I'm hanging up!!"`
`Natsuhi forcefully yelled that she was hanging up, but in actuality, she couldn't...`
`After all, this person was choosing to call her, and that was much better than the alternative.`
`......If she hung up violently,`
` ...this person might choose to call someone else...`
`"Let's play a bit to help you relax.`
` Don't worry, I won't take up much of your time."`
`"I, ...I have no intention of playing with you......!"`
`"......Your name is Natsuhi, Mother.`
` It has the kanji for a season in it.`
` Pretty nice name.`
` .........However, just because your name is Natsuhi, that doesn't necessarily mean that you like summer.`
` ...Which season is your real favorite, Mother......?"`
`"You think I'll tell you?"`
`"If you don't, ......I'll hang up.`
` .........Are you sure you want that?"`
`"...kh.................."`
`It was clearly a threat.`
`......It meant that if she forced him to hang up the phone,`
` anything might happen......`
`Humiliated that she was forced to give in to a threat made by a man whose name she didn't even know, she gave him the answer he wanted......`
`".........I‐.........it's autumn."`
`"Why......?"`
`"B‐because it's an easy season to pass the time in...!`
` There's no other reason in particular.`
` Are you satisfied now?!"`
`"Yeah, I'm satisfied.`
` ......It looks like your favorite season really is the same as mine.`
` ......I like the fall too.`
` .........Heheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheheh..."`
`"......Liar!`
` You just made that up...!"`
`This man would no doubt have done the same thing no matter which season I said I liked.`
`......What is he after?!`
`What's so fun about making me uncomfortable like this...?!`
`"It's not nice to call someone a liar.`
` ......I didn't make it up.`
` I was already certain that you liked the fall, Mother.`
` .........I can even show you proof."`
`"Proof.........?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Is there a clock in your room, Mother...?"`
`"...A clock......?`
` Y‐......yes, there is, but what's your point......?"`
`In Natsuhi's room, there was a beautiful antique clock with an intricate design.`
`......Krauss had bought it for her as a birthday present long ago.`
`".........It's seven minutes past midnight right now.`
` I'm tired, so please get this farce over with quickly...!"`
`"Try lifting the clock up."`
`"Wh‐why?"`
`".........You just don't know when to shut up.`
` Stop resisting every single time I say something.`
` Just shut up and do what I say."`
`The tone of the man's voice suddenly went low, turning into a threat.`
`{n}It indicated clear displeasure.`
`Outwardly, this man had a calm manner of speaking, but on the inside, things were completely different.`
`If she angered this man even the slightest bit further, he would surely show his true nature right away...`
`"......Are you really that eager to make me hang up?`
` You'd better start realizing how lucky you are that I'm talking on the phone with you right now......`
` ...I can tell your husband and daughter about what happened 19 years ago any time I want to..."`
`"I, I don't know what you're talking about, but please don't get my husband and daughter involved...!`
` I'm listening to everything you say...!"`
`"Then do what you're goddamn told......"`
`Once again, the man threatened me in a low voice, as though warning me never to talk back to him again...`
`My head was filled with the pain from my headache, the sound of my beating heart, ......and the roar of the sea...`
`......I couldn't disobey him anymore.`
`.........As the man had ordered, I lifted up the antique clock...`
`".................................?"`
`There lay something that resembled a single playing card.`
`{n}............?`
`Perhaps it was the warranty for the clock.........?`
`{n}Thinking this, she took it and turned it over............`
`"Are you.........wide awake now?"`
`"Eek, ah,`
` ......aaaaaaaahhhhh......`
` Wh‐`
`wh‐wh‐`
`why...`
` ...Why is...`
`...this...?!?!"`
`"Well, I'll be happy if your headache's gone down a bit.`
` ......Tell me you're happy, Mother."`
`"How did you...?!`
` Why?!`
` How?!"`
`"I want you to tell me you're happy, you murderer.`
` How dare you act like a normal, neat‐freak mother. You make me want to vomit.`
` Do you want some of it to land on your husband and daughter as well?`
` You don't, do you?`
` You want me to keep quiet, don't you?`
` Yeah, I'll keep quiet. See, aren't you happy?`
` Aren't you happy?!"`
`"Ah, .........aaaah, I'm happy... I'm happy...!!`
` So please...stop...`
` Don't burden my husband and daughter...!`
` What is it you want?`
` Money?`
` How much?!"`
`"I don't want money.`
` ......My wounds couldn't be healed with any amount of money.`
` But there is a medicine.`
` ......Yes,`
` it's like a kind of ointment.`
` ......Thick, syrupy and dribbling."`
`"............And that is...`
`my hatred,`
` ......my resentment towards you.`
` ...Slathering myself with that...`
`is the only way to hold back the pain..."`
`Natsuhi had never had anything so hateful said to her in her entire life.`
`So she suspected many times that she must be having some sort of bad dream.`
`However, ......this definitely wasn't a dream...`
`"......Y‐`
`...you couldn't possibly be...`
`...on this island right now, could you...?"`
`"I am.`
` Didn't I promise you?`
` I said I'd be at the family conference."`
`"That's impossible...!`
` There's no way you could have come during this typhoon...!!"`
`"That's no problem if I came before the typhoon reached here.`
` ......And I'm pretty sure this guest called Erika or whatever arrived even during the typhoon."`
`Her blood froze......`
`{n}Furudo Erika had been brought here by coincidence...`
`{n}If he knew that name, he would have to be very close by......`
`"Wh‐`
`......where...`
`...a‐`
`......are you.........?"`
`"......I won't appear in front of anyone until you introduce me.`
` Don't worry.`
` .........Oh yeah, it's useless to try and search for me.`
` Your mansion is huge.`
` And you have phones all over the place.`
` Besides, I'm sure you don't want to see me either, do you?"`
`"......Or are you offering to find me and introduce me to everyone...?`
` Introduce me to Jessica too.`
` ......Tell her I'm her older brother by one year.`
` Heheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheheh!!"`
`"S‐stop it...... Stay away from Jessica......"`
`"I guess I've scared you a bit too much.`
` That's all from me...for tonight.`
` ......But don't forget.`
` You cannot disobey me.`
` Understand,`
` ......Mother?"`
`"......Y‐.........yes......"`
`"I'm going to hang up for the night, ......but I have an order to be followed up until tomorrow morning."`
`"Wh‐......what is that.........?"`
`"You may no longer leave that room tonight, and you may not make any phone calls.`
` If the phone rings, you aren't allowed to pick it up, either.`
` And you will turn the lights off right now, get in bed, and sleep.`
` Then you will wake up at your ordinary time.`
` ............Heheheheheh.`
` It sure is nice to live a healthy life.`
` I really am such a good son, working so hard for the sake of my Mother's body......"`
`"I, ......I understand.`
` I'll sleep right now.`
` I won't leave my room, and I won't pick up the phone...!`
` So please, don't tell my husband and daughter......!"`
`"As long as you follow my orders, I'll keep your secret, Mother.`
` ......Don't disobey me.`
` ......I'm already very close by.`
` I can easily tell whether you've turned your lights off and whether you're on the phone.`
` ...If I wished to, I could even kiss your sleeping face."`
`"I'll keep it!`
` I'll keep my promise!!`
` So stop it, just stop it!`
` Stop iiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iittt!!"`
`......As she screamed, Natsuhi crushed the card she had found under the clock into a little ball.`
`It had a pattern on it like a tarot card,`
` along with one single word:`
` "Autumn".........`
`We go back in time once again.`
`The large clock in the hall was right in the middle of striking midnight.`
`Wondering who the person who had now knocked twice was,`
` ......the relatives in the dining hall stared at the door.`
`Rudolf told them to come in.`
` ......But there was no answer.`
`Until the end of that long tone marking the coming of midnight, which had come from the large clock in the hall shortly after the knock,`
` they were unable to move in the slightest......`
`"......Maybe their hands are full and they can't open it......"`
`"Maybe.`
` ......But it's a little creepy that they won't say their name."`
`"......Should I open it?"`
`"Do it."`
`Kanon nodded back, then slowly opened the door......`
`"Ah, ......what's that...?!"`
`"......It's......one of Dad's envelopes?"`
`Right behind the opened door, on the floor of the hallway,`
` ......lay the envelope.`
`"There's no one in the hallway.`
` Perhaps they placed this here and left..."`
`The adults flew out into the corridor as well,`
` but they could find no trace of anyone who might have knocked on the door......`
`Barely an hour ago, Shannon and Kanon had come in to serve tea.`
`At that time, everyone had seen that nothing lay in that spot.`
`Someone came, knocked, left an envelope with the mark of the One‐winged Eagle on it, and left...`
`"C‐......could it have been...the Master......?!"`
`"......It's not unthinkable.`
` ......Father's pretty much the only person in this mansion who would refuse to answer when asked who he was."`
`"That's not possible.`
` If that's so, then why didn't Father come in here openly?"`
`"......That's right.`
` Father would probably just come in here all of a sudden without knockin'...`
` The doors and windows of this mansion are locked now, right...?`
` In that case, the only people who could've left the letter there are Krauss‐san, Natsuhi‐san, and Genji‐san."`
`By this point, the mansion had been completely locked up.`
`Therefore, those in the guesthouse—the cousins, Nanjo, Gohda, Kumasawa, and Erika—could not have come here.`
`Furthermore, since Krauss, Natsuhi, and Genji were the only three who weren't in this room,`
` one of those three had to have been the one who set that letter down in the corridor.`
`In that case, it was very likely that Krauss and the others had placed the letter there to make it seem like a message from Kinzo...`
`"I see...`
` It'll have something written on it which is supposedly in Father's name, saying that he won't accept Battler‐kun as the next head, or something of the sort.`
` Ridiculous.`
` I can't believe you'd try to pull such a childish trick, Nii‐san...!"`
`"It's not like I have any interest in being the next head..."`
`"Give up.`
` This is just your fate.`
` ......Anyway, why don't we read what's inside?"`
`Rudolf set the letter on the dining hall table and showed everyone the front and back,`
` almost like a magician does before performing his act to show that there are no tricks or hidden mechanisms.`
`"......This envelope is without a doubt Father's?"`
`"Y‐...yes, there's no doubt.`
` Father liked to use these envelopes for handwritten letters...`
` What do you think, Shannon‐chan?"`
`"Y‐yes......`
` ......To my eyes as well, ......it looks like the type of envelope that the Master uses..."`
`"That doesn't mean Father was the one who wrote it.`
` It would be pitifully easy for Nii‐san to snatch one of these from a drawer in Father's study...!"`
`"Even Krauss‐sama cannot easily enter the study...`
` It might be hard for him to steal an envelope......"`
`"Let's try opening it.`
` We can think about this later.`
` ......There's something in it.`
` I wonder what."`
`Rudolf opened the envelope a bit roughly.`
`Then, a folded letter...`
`...and a glittering object fell out.`
`......It was a ring.`
`"Huh?`
` ............Wait a second, ...that ring is......!"`
`Eva noticed it immediately and grabbed it...`
`"Th‐`
`......this is...`
`...Father's ring...!`
` I‐it's the Head's Ring!!"`
`"......Wh‐...what in the...!!`
` Seriously?!"`
`"Are you sure it's Father's ring...?`
` Could it be a replica...?"`
`"No, this is the real thing!`
` I've always dreamed about wearing this ring on my finger someday.`
` Even though Father wore this on his finger, I know more about it than anyone else.`
` ......This is Father's ring, no doubt about it!`
` Why is it here?!"`
`"Then it really {i:was} Father who wrote this letter...?!"`
`"......Heh, heheheheh.`
` The sender isn't Dad.`
` ...It's someone much more interesting."`
`"Then, ......who is the letter from?"`
`"It's from the Ushiromiya family alchemist!`
` .........The Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama......!!"`
`Rudolf showed everyone the part of the letter where that was written.`
`{n}It really did say that......`
`"I‐......it's from {f:5:Beatrice}......?!"`
`"What's it say......?"`
`"I'll read it.`
` .........<Congratulations>...`
` I acknowledge that Battler‐sama has spectacularly solved the riddle of the epitaph and reached the Golden Land.`
` .........The gold belongs to him in its entirety.`
` Furthermore, he is also the new head of the Ushiromiya family.`
` ......As proof, ............I send the Head's Ring, which Kinzo‐sama left in my charge...`
` ......Battler‐sama, I beg that you put on this ring, become the new master of the gold, and lead the Ushiromiya family into the future.`
` ......I pray with utmost sincerity that you flourish as the new head............"`
`"......Hah, ......hahah!`
` What the hell...!`
` I see, Dad just won't come out of his study, so {f:5:Beatrice}, the witch of the forest, has acknowledged Battler directly...!`
` Hahaha, haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!"`
`"......Battler‐kun.`
` You should hold onto this ring.`
` ......This is a special ring to be worn by the family head.`
` .........I don't know who this {f:5:Beatrice} is,`
` but she's watched the whole thing and sent you this ring after acknowledging you as the true successor."`
`"I‐......is that alright...?`
` It's such an important ring......"`
`"Yeah, it's fine.`
` You should wear it proudly on your finger.`
` ......Got it? Even if Aniki and Natsuhi‐san tell you to take it off, you better not do it no matter what...!"`
`With creepy smiles on their faces, all of the relatives urged Battler to put the ring on his finger...`
`It looked like things would get pretty nasty if he refused, so Battler reluctantly decided to put it on the middle finger of his left hand......`
`The ring was heavy and stiff......`
`At that moment, Krauss returned.`
`......Genji came back as well immediately afterwards.`
`"My apologies.`
` It looks like my wife isn't feeling so well, so she's gone to bed early.`
` ............Did something happen?`
` You all seem incredibly flustered."`
`"..................Battler‐sama, ......that........."`
`Immediately, Genji keenly spotted the thing that Battler had just put on his finger...`
`"Your eyesight's pretty good, Genji‐san!`
` ......Looks like you know whose ring this is."`
`"What...?`
` What are you talking about......?"`
`From Krauss's questioning look, it was very difficult to imagine that he could have been the one who set that letter there......`
`Furthermore, his expression quickly changed into one of shock.`
`"Eheheheheh!!`
` That's right, it's the ring of the Ushiromiya family head!!"`
`The family conference took up this new topic,`
` ......and the storm came once again.........`
`The rain was still pouring down as hard as ever.`
`......This weather was supposed to continue all day tomorrow as well, which was making me feel a bit depressed.`
`......Oh wait...given the time, that's today, not tomorrow...`
`{n}But that doesn't really matter now.`
`.........I'm sleepy...`
`With half‐asleep eyes, I opened my umbrella.`
`{n}The large drops of rain pounded against it mercilessly.........`
`Technically, they had called an end to the family conference at {nobr:1 a.m.},`
` but the post‐match scuffles were still dragging on.`
`I was really jealous of Auntie Rosa, who managed to slip out of there at that time.`
`She cleverly got away by saying that she'd check on Maria, who might have been staying up too late.`
`Thanks to Dad constantly involving me, I missed my chance to escape,`
` ...and they made me stick around until now, ......{nobr:3 a.m.}...`
`What on Earth did they spend all that time deciding...?`
`Nothing got decided at all.`
`......They just kept on arguing about who said what, like elementary school kids.`
`......They must be tired too.`
`I'm sure that's why they keep dragging on with the same pointless questions.`
`I no longer felt any shock or anger towards them.`
`{n}I guess no painkiller works better than drowsiness...`
`......I left them behind and finally returned to the guesthouse.`
`When I returned to the guesthouse, the lights were on in the lounge downstairs.`
`Not only that, I could even hear people chatting inside......`
`{n}Apparently, some people were still awake even at this time of night.`
`Despite the late hour, Gohda‐san and Doctor Nanjo were still awake and chatting.`
`Plates and cups were lined up on the counter,`
` and it looked almost like a bar with Gohda‐san as the bartender.`
`After noticing I'd come back, it looked as though Doctor Nanjo finally realized how late it was.`
`As Gohda‐san made to top off his glass, he declined with an exaggerated gesture.`
`"No, that's enough, that's enough.`
` ......It's already too late to be up."`
`"Look how late it's gotten...`
` You were such a good person to chat with, I hardly noticed."`
`"No, no, it was your skill at entertaining that made the difference.`
` We'll have to do this again sometime."`
`"Yes, gladly!`
` Battler‐sama, welcome back.`
` Is the discussion with Krauss‐sama and the others still continuing?"`
`"......The way things were going, they'll probably drag it all the way out until dawn.`
` None of my business..."`
`I spoke carelessly, with a big yawn.`
`".........You all have more stamina than I expected.`
` It's quite a surprise."`
`"Oh, ......so you're here too..."`
`"......Yes, a humble little night gathering had begun to form quite naturally here,`
` so I took it upon myself to join.`
` .........Don't worry, I haven't said a word about you‐know‐what."`
`"..........................."`
`Erika could be seen on the sofa.`
`She had taken her shoes off and was lounging around as though she owned the place.`
`"And you too, Erika‐sama—you are very knowledgeable on a variety of subjects.`
` I enjoyed listening to you immensely."`
`"Your knowledge truly is extensive.`
` Very impressive for one so young..."`
`".........You're very welcome.`
` It's merely the trivial knowledge of Furudo Erika."`
`Erika posed by picking up the hem of her skirt.`
`She was lounging on the sofa with her feet up, so it didn't look remotely elegant.`
`"......Where's Auntie Rosa?"`
`"She returned around 1 a.m., but she went straight upstairs to sleep."`
`That was probably the right choice...`
`{n}She'd been going along with that conference for so long.`
` I feel like flopping down in bed right away myself.`
`......I've had it.`
`{n}I'm tired enough that I might flop over right here...`
`".........Well then, let's call it a night.`
` Don't you have to get up early tomorrow morning to make breakfast, Gohda‐san?"`
`"Preparations for breakfast have already been made.`
` As always, I have full confidence that you will enjoy it greatly, so please look forward to it."`
`In Gohda‐san's eyes, the family conference is an open stage on which to display his culinary skills.`
`{n}He's probably so pumped up he won't even get sleepy.`
`As she laughed at how youthful Gohda was, Erika stood up.`
`{n}This acted as the sign that it was time to disperse.`
`"I will clean up here.`
` Please enjoy your sleep, everyone."`
`Leaving the clean‐up to Gohda‐san, I went to the bathroom and then climbed the stairs to the second floor.`
`"Goodnight, everyone.`
` These old bones have stayed up a little too late."`
`".........Good night, Doctor Nanjo.`
` Good night, Battler‐san."`
`"Yeah.`
` .........Night..."`
`Then, in the upstairs hallway, we split up.`
`Doctor Nanjo went to his own room.`
`Erika went to her room.`
`And I returned to the cousins' room.`
`I couldn't hear any sounds of playing coming from the cousins' room.`
`......Could they have already gone to sleep?`
`{n}No surprise, at this time of night.`
`{n}If they were still playing, they would have been staying up way too late...`
`When I opened the door quietly,`
` as expected, the room was already pitch black except for a small nightlight.`
`Everyone was already sleeping in their beds.`
`I bet they all had a great time horsing around.`
`......They probably had a ton of fun staying up late and talking about their youth.`
`......If only I hadn't found the gold, I could have had fun spending time with them...`
`I'm already...`
`tired...`
`...so tired.`
`Forgetting even to change my clothes or brush my teeth,`
` I crawled into bed,`
` .........and immediately started to sink into the marshes of sleep.........`
`Aaah, ......today's been so insane......`
`I wonder if that old bastard is still in that family conference now......`
`......How does he not get tired............?`
`Come to think of it......`
`......what was it that old bastard said when we parted company......?`
`— Tomorrow, there's something important I want to talk about, as a family.`
` It's about you.`
`......I'm sure it's more stuff about being the successor.`
`{n}...I don't even want to hear about it......`
`— If I tell you about this,`
` ......I'm probably gonna get murdered.`
`I'll murder you whenever you want, you old bastard......`
`And then, ......what was it he said next......?`
`— It's about your birth.`
`My...`
`............birth......?`
`......Probably just something about the noble Ushiromiya lineage......`
`Not interested......`
`.........Just let me`
`......sleep.........`
