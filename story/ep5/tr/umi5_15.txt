`"Then just say that I did it, okay?!`
` That's what you want me to say, right?!`
` Waa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhhhh...!!!"`
`As though she had given up and decided that it would be useless to try and talk her way out of this any longer,`
` Aunt Natsuhi said that and screamed.`
`......It was a sad incident.`
`I wanted to believe that, despite the pitiable circumstances which led to her marriage into the Ushiromiya family,`
` ......Aunt Natsuhi had been able to find some small measure of happiness with Uncle Krauss and Jessica.`
`......But instead, by Aunt Natsuhi's own hand, Uncle Krauss,`
` ......and even her beloved daughter Jessica,`
` ......had been heartlessly killed...`
`It was even harder to believe that Grandfather had been an accomplice and hid the bodies...`
`However, several people had given clear testimony that Grandfather's mental state for these last few years...`
`had been far from what anyone would consider normal.`
`Perhaps, possessed by a mad devotion to the mistress he had lost long ago,`
` ......Grandfather might truly have believed that Aunt Natsuhi was a reincarnation of {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`Where is Grandfather now?`
`Like Erika theorized,`
` did he really believe that he could revive {f:5:Beatrice} by carrying out murders following the epitaph,`
` and succumb to Natsuhi's cajolery?`
`......Right now, is he holding some kind of disturbing ritual with the bodies he carried away......?`
`"Are you............`
`......satisfied now.........?`
` ......This...`
`...is what you wanted to make me say, right......?"`
`Aunt Natsuhi sobbed as she spoke.`
`"......This is...`
`......your revenge, isn't it......?`
` You, the man from 19 years ago...!!"`
`This "man from 19 years ago" that Aunt Natsuhi kept mentioning was the man who had supposedly framed her.`
`However, referring to "a man from 19 years ago" was as far as she would go,`
` and she made no attempt at all to explain what had actually happened back then...`
`"I'm certain......that a pawn of that man is among us now.`
` ......I'm sure that right now, that man is ridiculing me through one of you..."`
`".........So tell me...!`
` Are you happy now?`
` Has a little of that pain and suffering you've endured for 19 years gone away...?!`
` .........I finally understand.`
` ...The reason you brought me down to this point......is because......you wanted to make me admit it, isn't it......?"`
`"......Natsuhi‐san.`
` Other than us, there's absolutely no one here.`
` Please stop this insanely desperate charade and quit pretending that someone who doesn't exist actually does."`
`Erika laughed mockingly, but, as Aunt Natsuhi looked at us...`
`......no, as she looked at some being behind us, ......she hung her head and shook.`
`Then, .........she confessed to her sin.`
`"I.........committed murder......"`
`"So you finally admit your crime directly."`
`"No,`
` this is not about what has happened today and yesterday.`
` .........I confess to a murder that occurred 19 years ago."`
`The adults all whispered together, wondering what this was about.`
`{n}......Because they had never heard about a murder case 19 years ago.`
`"......19 years ago,`
` ......I.........committed a sin.`
` .........I couldn't tolerate it.`
` ......That.........baby...!!"`
`"Baby?`
` Now what are you talking about?"`
`"......On that day 19 years ago,`
` ...Father entrusted me with a baby.`
` .........Since I was having so much trouble conceiving a successor, Father told me to adopt a child,`
` ......and he brought me a baby which he said was from a welfare institute......and he put it in my arms..."`
`"Do you have any idea......how humiliating that was to me as a woman...?!"`
`With a mix of conflicting emotions, of anger, sadness, regret and possibly defiance,`
` Aunt Natsuhi confessed.`
`The humiliation as a woman that others had given up hope on her ever bearing a child.`
`{n}And also, the indescribably unpleasant feeling of being made to nurse a strange baby.`
`It caused her great sadness and rage,`
` and before very many nights passed, it ate a hole into her heart......`
`And then, ......I sold my soul.........to demons...`
`.........It happened when I went on a walk through the rose garden to the harbor, along with a servant holding the baby...`
`......I wanted to be alone,`
` ......but that servant woman holding the baby faithfully followed me everywhere.`
`I was unable even to tell her to stop following me, ......and therefore unable to escape from the child's crying......`
`.........That day...`
`marked the beginning of 19 long, headache‐filled years......`
`.........Then, we were by the fence overlooking the cliff.`
`If by taking that baby...`
`...and throwing it down onto the rocky beach far below me,`
` ......I could make all this go away...`
`......I really did hear that demonic temptation in my ear.`
`And.........for the smallest of moments, I thought of how wonderful it would be if I really could do that,`
` ......and lent an ear to that temptation.`
` ......And that was when—`
`The servant holding the baby stepped on a large rock, twisted her ankle, and staggered......`
`She leaned against the rough fence, ......and at that moment, I thought I heard the fence creak loudly.`
`I told her to look out and went to grab her shoulder.`
`......No,`
` ......I shouldn't be so vague...`
` I'll repent.`
` I'll confess.`
` .........At that moment, I'm sure that......as I told her to look out,`
` ............with both hands,`
` I reached for that servant's shoulders,`
` and with a thud,`
` ......I pushed her away hard......`
`The rough fence snapped from the base,`
` .........and the servant,`
` ......along with the baby held in her arms,`
` .........fell down towards the rocky beach below......`
`Even though...`
`...I remember that moment vividly,`
` ...for some reason I recall a vague...`
`...and very strange feeling.`
`It almost felt as though instead of falling,`
` ......the two of them were silently swallowed up into empty space.`
`So I never even heard the sound of them crashing to the rocky beach.`
`No, I must have heard it.`
`But because I wanted to think that they'd simply disappeared,`
` ......I must have erased that sound from my memory...`
`".........A‐.........and then.........?"`
`"For an instant, ...I thought it was a dream.`
` ......It was high enough that I couldn't see the two of them below me just by leaning over.`
` So I couldn't tell whether their fall, ......the events of just a few seconds earlier, had actually happened or not..."`
`I must have been wishing so strongly that the child would fall from there...`
`that I hallucinated the whole thing...`
`Trying to make myself believe this, I hurried back to the rose garden.`
` ......I decided to say that I'd left the baby with the servant and had been taking a rest alone in the garden...`
`......Then,`
` .........Father asked what had happened to the baby,`
` ............`
`.........which caused a stir over the disappearance of the servant...`
`......who I'd left the baby with.........`
`Eventually, the broken fence was discovered,`
` .........and the two corpses were found at the bottom of the cliff...`
`......The baby's origins apparently couldn't be made known, so its existence was hushed up,`
` ......and the official story was that the servant simply died in an accident alone.`
`That's right.`
`I......stole away two innocent lives in one go.........`
`As for the poor servant......her family was generously compensated.`
`This was enough to satisfy her aged husband, who grieved over the unfortunate accident—he never knew the truth.`
`Then, just a few years ago, he died of old age, .........and I confessed the truth over his grave, apologizing.`
`".........But to this day...`
`......I have never apologized to that baby.`
` ......Yes,`
` .........that's what you're after, isn't it......?"`
`"So right here, right now, I'll confess to my crime!`
` ......I, Ushiromiya Natsuhi,`
` .........did 19 years ago...`
`......push you off a cliff...`
`...and try to kill you......"`
`......But...`
`......you didn't die after all......`
`.........You're still alive,`
` ......and you still call me "Mother"...`
`.........You came to this island,`
` .........and took your revenge on me, didn't you......?`
`When you learned...`
`......that you were pushed off a cliff by the woman you should have been calling a mother for the past 19 years,`
` ......you must have lived a life so full of hatred...`
`"......And now, ......you've taken everything I've gained since pushing you off that cliff,`
` 18 years of my life, ......and smashed it all to pieces...`
` ......I no longer have my beloved husband or daughter.`
` ......And I've lost even my honor,`
` ......and am being called a murderer...`
` .........No, ......I really am a murderer, aren't I......"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` ......It all went according to your plans.`
` ......I'm now regarded as a killer..."`
`"...............How is this for you...?`
` Is this enough...`
`...for your revenge......?"`
`"My husband and daughter have been killed!!`
` ......I've been made to look like a murderer......like an adulteress even......`
` After seeing me put through such terrible humiliation,`
` ............are you satisfied......?!"`
`"Yes, I'll bet you're quite satisfied...`
` ......Because my family...`
`...my honor...`
`......everything.........has been taken from me......`
` ......Uuughuu...`
`...*hic*......`
`uuu{0}u{0}ughh{0}u{0}u{0}h{0}h{0}uuu!!"`
`".........After all this, you still claim that you were framed?`
` Seriously, you just don't know when to give up."`
`"Can you hear me?! You, the cursed baby from 19 years ago...!!`
` Are you satisfied now?!`
` You've taken everything from me!!`
` What more do you want?!`
` ......Please,`
` ......just...`
`......forgive me............"`
`{a:c:`
`"......No good."}`
`"Huh.........?"`
`".........Battler‐san,`
` did you say something?"`
`{a:c:`
`"No good at all."}`
`".........B‐`
