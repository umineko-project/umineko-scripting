`"......Erika, Dlanor."`
`"Yes, my master."`
`"You {f:5:called}?"`
`"......I want you two to stay in this fragment...`
`...and explain everything in the remaining first through fourth games.`
` That pitiful transient witch no longer exists to assert her witch illusions.`
` Expose the naked truth with extreme prejudice."`
`"*giggle*! Leave it to me, my master.`
` There is no mystery that Furudo Erika cannot solve."`
`"......Of course.`
` That's why you're my piece, my double.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} wore a massive...and horrible smile, which Erika shared.`
`......{f:5:Beatrice}'s witch illusions would disappear,`
` and the results of all of the previous games would be painted over.`
`It had been crushed in every way possible, ......and only the naked truth remained.`
`To Erika, such a weak truth might as well have been fish on a chopping board...`
`"All four prior games...`
`can be explained as either Natsuhi's crimes or freak exceptions.`
` I won't let anyone talk about them as the crimes of some witch called {f:5:Beatrice} again.`
` I'll start compiling it together at once and present you a first‐rate tale."`
`"*giggle*......`
` You mustn't leave even a single fragment of Beato's Legend of the Witch behind.`
` The rumors among the servants, the way people talked about unexplained events as though a witch was the cause,`
` the witch illusions used alongside the illusion of Kinzo.`
` ......Deal with all of them completely."`
`"Of course.`
` I'll get to it right away.`
` ......We currently have the furniture in custody.`
` We're hurrying to identify their vessels."`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory had already been taken into custody.`
`Those noisy sisters who had served Beato now faced nothing but denial.`
`What sort of fantasy were they based upon which allowed them to "manifest"?`
`......Everything would be exposed...`
`...and denied.`
`"Eiserne Jungfrau has already begun its {f:5:investigation}.`
` Our most recent findings indicate that there is a high probability they were produced during the 1960's in New York or somewhere {f:5:nearby}.`
` An aide has already been sent to the {f:5:location}."`
`"The 1960's? The Seven Sisters of Purgatory are <Made in USA>?`
` Pfft, *giggle*giggle*giggle*......`
` Even though they bragged about being furniture connected with King Solomon and serving a thousand year old witch, they're a total sham.`
` So what are they...?"`
`"According to the report, there's this group of big‐time swindlers...`
`...who make money by selling high‐priced imitation goods to rich fans of the occult."`
`"The deceived millionaires resell the articles with invented histories,`
` and this may have caused the items to become falsely deified among {f:5:collectors}.`
` We are rushing to find confirmation and further {f:5:details}."`
`"Ushiromiya Kinzo was apparently a big customer of theirs who'd pay exorbitant sums for the most blatantly fake objects."`
`"......*giggle*giggle*, ...ahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` And that's what the Seven Sisters of Purgatory really are...?`
` That's ridiculous,`
` aha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hha{0}ha{0}hahha!!`
` A total sham, just what I'd expect from one of Beato's witch illusions."`
`"So despite calling themselves the seven deadly sins, they're actually cheap, fake souvenirs.`
` ......Of course,`
` from the first time I saw them, I figured they were nothing more than paperweights sold at some shady souvenir shop."`
`"*giggle*giggle*!! Paperweights...!`
` Ahhah{0}hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!`
` Have you confronted the Seven Sisters with that truth yet?"`
`"No, not {f:5:yet}."`
`"They still seriously believe...`
`that they were created by a great magician over a thousand years ago.`
` ......I can't wait to thrust the truth and perfect evidence in their faces...`
`and let them know that they're mere paperweights worth less than 30 US dollars."`
`"I wonder what kind of expressions will register on their faces as they lose all hope?`
` ......*giggle*, I can't wait.`
` Call me when you do it.`
` I'll come to watch, with some of the best black tea and dried plums."`
`Beato's witch illusions had already been seen through,`
` and it had been proven that every one of them was simply the result of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} fantasy.`
`What kind of fantasies created them and what was their basis?`
`{n}The illusions would be confronted with this perfectly proven truth...`
`......And at that time, they would disperse like smoke and be completely annihilated.`
`This was called......“execution”.`
`"......An execution is not a {f:5:show}.`
` As a general rule, it is not open to the {f:5:public}."`
`"This is an inspection by the great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, member of the Senate,`
` so she can observe that the Great Court is performing its duties satisfactorily.`
` Do you, a mere Inquisitor, intend to obstruct this...?"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` I'm just observing as a representative of the Senate to make sure you observe the proper procedures when you carry out your work.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"We are currently preparing to take {f:5:Virgilia}, Ronove, and Gaap into custody as well.`
` The Chiester Sisters Imperial Guards are conducting that investigation."`
`".........Of course, after that is done, we will then detain and execute the three Chiester Sisters, who are also connected to {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"Dlanor, what is the true nature of the Chiester Sisters?"`
`"......We believe there is a high likelihood that their vessels are weapons used in the {f:5:crimes}.`
` My senior aide, Gertrude, has formed a dedicated {f:5:team}.`
` We are currently investigating their individual {f:5:cases}."`
`"I'm looking forward to the Chiester Sisters' execution too...!`
` One at a time?`
` Or all of them at once?"`
`"No one's stupid enough to empty the entire can of tea leaves into the pot at once.`
` You've got to enjoy it slowly, one spoonful at a time."`
`"*giggle*giggle*! Exactly.`
` Let's hold their executions on consecutive days.`
` One for each witch and piece of furniture.`
` I'll present you with a new execution show every day."`
`"Wonderful.`
` .........After all, there really are a lot of them.`
` Looks like we'll be able to enjoy ourselves for a full two weeks."`
`"......Maybe we could let them decide among themselves which of them to execute first.`
` Heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh!`
` Make sure you think up something great for the execution concepts.`
` ......I'd like to enjoy executions both old and new from East and West every day."`
`"......The rules state that the method of execution is to follow Great Court {f:5:regulations}."`
`"Leave it to me, my master.`
` I will most certainly prepare you a fascinating execution show!"`
`"I expect quartering at the very least."`
`"Of course.`
` I shall make a list of the highest forms of execution from countries across the world from Europe to Asia,`
` which were used by kingdoms East and West for nothing less than treason against the king!"`
`"......I'd like to propose an execution method myself.`
` ...Pondering that will be the perfect way to relax on those sleepless nights.`
` ......*giggle*. I'll come up with an idea and send you a letter soon."`
`"Certainly, my master.`
` Then we'll use the {f:5:Bernkastel}‐style execution for the grand finale.`
` ......At the very, very end, when all of the illusions have been broken and Beato's system of magic has been completely crushed,`
` ...I shall present you with the finest execution you desire...at the execution of {f:5:Beatrice}...!"`
`"Thank you, Erika.`
` ......Thanks to you, it seems I'll be able to forget the pain of my illness for a little while......`
` *giggle*giggle*, hehe{0}he{0}he{0}heh{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!`
` You're just perfect.`
` My piece, my double,`
` ......and my precious daughter."`
`"Y‐......your words are too good for me...! My master...!!"`
`"Erika, I will give you honor and a reward.`
` ......Beato's greatest symbol, the portrait in the reception hall.`
` Take it down, smash it to make firewood, bake a cake over that fire and eat it.`
` Then you have my permission to put your own portrait up in the empty frame."`
`"...Th‐......thank you very much...!`
` It is the greatest of honors...!"`
`".........You will eradicate and erase {f:5:Beatrice}'s name and all traces of her.`
` Until that is all finished, I order you to become the master of this sealed‐off Rokkenjima."`
`"......By the name of the Witch of Miracles, {f:5:Bernkastel},`
` I hereby grant you the rank of witch until that day arrives.`
` ......From now on, you will call yourself {f:5:Erika}, Witch of Truth."`
`"W‐`
`......Witch...of Truth......!`
` ......Th‐`
`......thank you very much, my master...!!`
` I vow to work even harder so that this honor is not wasted...!"`
`Even though she was nothing more than a piece,`
` .........she was being granted the honor of calling herself a witch like her master, if only for a brief stretch of time......`
`Erika was so moved at having her hard work acknowledged in this greatest form that she trembled......`
`"Dlanor, continue to aid {f:5:Erika}...`
`and report on her progress to me."`
`"......As you {f:5:wish}."`
`"............By the way, where's Lambda?"`
`"She is over {f:5:there}."`
`From the guest seating on the second floor, she pointed downwards.`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta}.........could be seen beneath Battler, who hung there dead, run through by the red longsword.`
`".........Ushiromiya Battler...`
` You were an interesting guy.`
` ...You could have been so much more interesting...... Such a shame."`
`"I think it was a wonderful way to die.`
` .........{f:5:Erika}!`
` You can hang Battler's corpse in the mansion's reception hall.`
` ......The next time I come to visit this fragment, welcome me in front of it."`
`"Certainly, my master.`
` I'll make that foolish man an eternal monument to your victory!"`
`"*giggle*, that sounds wonderful. Super stylish.`
` Maybe you can coat him with plaster and make a beautiful white statue.`
` ......And it'd be even better if you decorated him all cute!"`
`"Yes, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` I will strive to answer your expectations...!"`
`"Grats on your witch promotion.`
` Even though it's only temporary, I welcome you as a friend."`
`Erika was so overcome with emotion that tears came to her eyes.`
`.........Because no greater pleasure exists for a piece than having its efforts acknowledged by its master.`
`"In the end, I'd like to have Beato stuffed too.`
` Then I'll have her displayed on high in the reception hall."`
`"Lake Shirakaba?"`
`"The {c:86EF9C:{y:0:Human}{n:0:human}‐hunting Count}."`
`"......You know,`
` I read that back when I wasn't a witch.`
` ...I wondered, how can humans who obtain eternal life become so cruel?`
` I always found that strange.`
` ......At the time, I honestly couldn't relate."`
`".........After becoming a witch and living a thousand years, I fully understand it.`
` ......That writer could understand our cruelty really well, in the truest sense.`
` *giggle*giggle*!"`
`"......Where to next?`
` I guess we'll go off in opposite directions like always?"`
`"Only because I don't want to bore you."`
`"Thanks, Bern.`
` But you can be sure that I'll count to a hundred and then start searching for you again."`
`"You never let me get bored, do you?`
` That's why I like you, love you.`
` ............Let's meet again somewhere.`
` Of course, that might be a hundred or a thousand years from now...or never again for all eternity."`
`"It'll work out.`
` The sea of fragments is tiny to a pair who love each other."`
`"The Third Man?"`
`"No, Children of Paradise, of course."`
`".........If each time you smashed one of those countless fragments that glitter like a starry night,`
` you could escape the poison of just a single evening's worth of boredom,`
` even you would want to count the stars in the sky."`
`"Ooh, not bad...pfft, *giggle*giggle*...!"`
`The witches known as Voyagers travel across the countless glittering futures of possibility,`
` ......and gobble them up, trying to escape their illness called boredom for as long as they can.`
`The tiny, tiny fragment created by the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} known as {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`...had now been gobbled up by the two witches...`
`...and had lost its glitter.`
`The two who had earlier called themselves rivals in front of Beato...`
`now stopped that charade and laughed together playfully.`
`"{f:5:Erika}.`
` The new ruler of this fragment.`
` .........Weave the truth, ......and create the tale that leads up to this world's demise.`
` ...Umm, the next was the sixth game, right?"`
`"Yes, it's the sixth game."`
`"Decide the title for Episode 6 yourself.`
` After all, you're already the spinner of this tale, as well as its Master."`
`"Thank you very much.`
` ......Actually, I've already decided on one."`
`"......Oh, already?`
` ......Then let me hear it.`
` What's the title?"`
`"It is...`
`Episode 6.........`
`heheheheh, actually, I'd like to tease you a bit, but I'll tell you."`
`"*giggle*!`
` Come on, stop being a smartass and tell us.`
` A newbie witch like you shouldn't be teasing your seniors!"`
`"Episode 6: Checkmate of the Golden Witch!"`
