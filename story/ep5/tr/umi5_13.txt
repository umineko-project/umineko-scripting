`"Battler‐san returned to the guesthouse at {nobr:3 a.m.}`
` Then, the rest of you split up about thirty minutes later, is that correct?"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` We were getting pretty tired by that point.`
` We decided to take a short rest before starting up again."`
`To smoke out the murderer of the first twilight,`
` Erika closely questioned everyone involved to check their alibis and evidence.`
`To confirm these, she went around the mansion with them,`
` and when needed, took several trips out to the guesthouse through all the rain.`
`......Her vitality was admirable.`
`......Though she was an uninvited guest,`
` everyone had long since stopped feeling anything strange about the way she imitated a detective...`
`"......It seems Erika is also steadily building her foundation."`
`"It's useless.`
` Whether alibis exist or not, she can't deny our existence.`
` ......Kinzo escaped through the window and is now one with the mists of Rokkenjima.`
` She can never capture or deny him."`
`"When all's said and done, perhaps you could say he's escaped to the underside of the chessboard."`
`"In that case, maybe it would be appropriate to say he's been stored away."`
`"......Come to think of it, about those corpses from the first twilight.`
` They've been stored away too, right?"`
`"Yes.`
` They've been put away in my darkness between the human world and the other."`
`"......And that would‐be detective won't be able to find them...?"`
`"Of course.`
` It's absolutely impossible for a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` .........Want to check?"`
`"Just in case.`
` And we also need to take this opportunity to reexamine what Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}'s goals are likely to be from now on."`
`"As they say, if you know your enemy, you need not fear the outcome of a hundred battles."`
`"If you know the truth, you can win a hundred battles without fighting."`
`"Pukkukukukuku.`
` Quite so."`
`Gaap opened up a large pitch‐black hole in the sky and had it swallow all of them up.`
`She invited Beato and Ronove to the gap between worlds where she had hidden the corpses......`
`......That place was nowhere in this world,`
` and existed at no time of this world.`
`In other words, it truly and literally was a place not of this world.`
`In this place, questions such as "Where is this?" and "What time is it?" had no meaning.`
`Every single place led to here, but no place could be reached from here.`
`Furthermore, all times connected to this place, but no time could be passed to from here.`
`In short, ......this place was just what they said it was: the underside of the chessboard.`
`No, perhaps it would be most appropriate to call this the captured pile, where pieces that have left the game go......`
`......Then, deep within this pitch‐black world,`
` five corpses came into view, illuminated by a glow like a faint spotlight......`
`The five pitiful corpses with their necks sliced open had been arranged neatly.`
`Their eyelids were shut and their hands joined.`
`{n}Apparently, even Gaap had respect for the dead...`
`"Oh my.`
` .........There are five sacrifices for the first twilight in this game?`
` Not six?"`
`"Oh, it's you, Master.`
` I was worried about where you'd gone.`
` The game has already reached the first twilight, and as you can see, the first victims have emerged.`
` ......Now it's time for the real show. I'm getting all excited...!"`
`"I see.`
` .........The version of you that's here looks to be in high spirits.`
` I'm pleased."`
`"Hm??`
` If you took away my high spirits, my bewitching <body>,`
` and my pleasant disposition, I'd have nothing left!`
` Wahaha."`
`For some reason, {f:5:Virgilia} praised Beato for her high spirits.`
`Though Beato was taken aback at such granny‐like words coming out of {f:5:Virgilia}'s mouth all of a sudden,`
` she answered while bumping a fist against her chest.`
`{f:5:Virgilia} had been absent often during this game.`
`She might even have been away from her seat when Battler solved the epitaph and during the uproar that followed.`
`Apparently, she had been absent for so many critical points...`
`that she didn't have a very good grasp of what had happened so far in this game...`
`"For now, we've got five corpses.`
` ......All slit through the neck, as you can see."`
`George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, Genji.`
`Something sharp had sliced open all five of their necks......`
`Those gaping wounds opened wider than their mouths,`
` ......and made it feel as though they would no longer need their mouths to breathe.`
`"......I see.`
` So, {p:1:anyone looking at George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, or Genji's corpses could confirm at a glance that they are dead}."`
`"Hmm?`
` Red?`
` Well, there's no point in me holding out against you.`
` That's right,`
` {p:1:at a glance, anyone could confirm that these corpses are dead, so it is absolutely impossible that they are just people playing dead}."`
`"Why did Lia use the red......?"`
`"Who knows.`
` ......However, she is always thinking of Milady.`
` She must have something in mind that will benefit Milady."`
`"......Hmmm."`
`But they had hidden the corpses here so that no one could use the red...`
`Despite that, however, Ronove was right—{f:5:Virgilia} always thought of {f:5:Beatrice} first.`
`The way that these corpses, which Gaap had gone to all the trouble of erasing, had now been confirmed with the red made a slightly displeased expression rise to Gaap's face.`
`However, in the end she remembered that she was only a guest and shrugged.`
`"Why did you have Gaap hide the corpses?"`
`"Well,`
` since the epitaph has already been solved, this game of mine is different from usual.`
` I now have serving and protecting Natsuhi as my goal."`
`"...........................`
` How would concealing their corpses protect Natsuhi?"`
`"......We've more or less figured out what our opponents' moves will be.`
` This is probably a trap made to corner Natsuhi.`
` Most likely, they'll sort through alibis for the first twilight and find them for everyone except Natsuhi."`
`"Last night, Natsuhi‐sama was the first to leave the family conference, and then rested alone in her room.`
` ......Unfortunately, she has no alibi whatsoever until the next morning."`
`"We have already ensured that Kinzo's existence is impossible to disprove.`
` ......However, the enemy has one remaining method of breaking through that roadblock."`
`"I see.`
` .........They can corner Natsuhi and make her confess that Kinzo doesn't exist."`
`"Mm.`
` The enemy is probably after something like that.`
` By watching the movements of the pieces involved with the family conference, we quickly realized that Natsuhi was isolated,`
` noticed that trap of theirs, and countered with this move."`
`"The corpses disappear!`
` Everyone has alibis, and no one exists who could have moved them.`
` Not only does this support the claim that a witch exists, it also throws doubt on whether they were actually dead in the first place,`
` making it just about possible for Natsuhi to avoid being a suspect."`
`"In other words, it's possible for Natsuhi‐sama to claim...`
`that the sacrifices of the first twilight were only playing dead."`
`"Even though many people confirmed their deaths for certain in the cousins' room...?"`
`"‘Confirmation’ is nowhere near red truth...!`
` No matter how strongly they claim to have seen unmistakeable corpses, the red truth doesn't exist in the human world!`
` Because the corpses don't exist, Natsuhi can discount their words as a mistake,`
` a trick, or by saying that all of them were lying,`
` and it's possible for her to do this over and over to buy time for herself."`
`"In the human world, which lacks the red truth, perpetual check is an effective move."`
`"An endless argument with both sides denying the other's claims.`
` ......Not pretty."`
`"True.`
` However, beauty is secondary to victory.`
` If someone who cannot achieve victory seeks it, it is nothing but a poison to them."`
`"They do say that might makes right.`
` Wahahahahaha."`
`"And even if I don't think it's beautiful,`
` those Voyager witches will probably like it and say it isn't boring..."`
`"............I see.`
` I've managed to grasp the flow of this game.`
` ...It seems that it will get quite nasty."`
`"We're fully aware of that.`
` ......And we already know that Natsuhi is probably about to be lured into yet another trap."`
`"A trap?"`
`"Mm.`
` Someone Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} created, who calls himself a man from 19 years ago, has already threatened Natsuhi.`
` She was ordered to go into a closet in a certain guest room at {nobr:1 p.m.}, which is only a few minutes away, and hide there.`
` ......Krauss was taken as a hostage, so Natsuhi can't resist."`
`".........I see.`
` How relentless.`
` ...Can you protect her?"`
`"Of course.`
` After all, Natsuhi isn't the culprit.`
` No matter how much they treat her as one, both truth and illusions are on our side.`
` There's no way we can lose.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`Natsuhi threw her cup of black tea to the ground in protest to show the anger that flowed throughout her entire body.`
`"......Wh‐what do you mean by that...?!!`
` A‐are you......saying that you suspect me?!!"`
`"I hear what you're saying: you left before anyone else, returned to your room, and didn't leave that room until morning.`
` I am simply explaining that I need you to prove that, otherwise it won't count as an alibi."`
`"Prove it...?!`
` How...?!!"`
`"Any way you like.`
` All you have to do is prove objectively that it was impossible for you to commit the crime.`
` .........Everyone else is cooperating.`
` I would very much appreciate it if you could also be a little less harsh with me and please give me your alibi and evidence."`
`"......That's right.`
` The whole night is a blank space in time for Natsuhi nee‐san.`
` ......After she left the conference saying she was going to bed, she might have gone to the guesthouse and attacked George and the others..."`
`"Don't be so ridiculous!!`
` Why would I kill George‐kun, and most of all, whyever would I kill my own daughter?!!"`
`"Calm down.`
` ......We're all equally suspicious.`
` It's sad, but we all have to prove our innocence."`
`"Yeah.`
` We've all been thinking frantically about how to prove our alibis for last night so we can clear up the suspicion against us."`
`"I know you can't like being suspected, Natsuhi‐san.`
` If it frustrates you, shouldn't your first priority be searchin' for some way to prove your own innocence...?"`
`The relatives spoke as though they were all under equal suspicion,`
` but the mood about the place didn't feel so peaceful.`
`Erika was still in the middle of confirming everything,`
` but other than Natsuhi, who was unwilling to prove her alibi,`
` everyone else had an alibi which was reasonably credible.`
`Only Natsuhi, who claimed that just being suspected was an insult, was uncooperative with Erika,`
` and her position began to grow more and more perilous......`
`This parlor was no longer a place of comfort for Natsuhi.`
`{n}And the sound of the cup smashing had made that decisive.`
`"Th‐......this is ridiculous!`
` Why must I be suspected when I've lost a daughter...?!!`
` You're maliciously trying to make me look like the culprit just because I went to bed early last night!`
` I cannot stand this humiliation any further...!!"`
`"Oh, so what are you going to do about it?`
` Show us some kind of alibi that proves your innocence.`
` As if you could!!`
` Give me back my George, you murderer!!"`
`"Give it a rest, Eva...!`
` ......Natsuhi‐san, you're probably a little tired too.`
` Of course, so are we.`
` Why don't we take it easy for a bit...?"`
`".........Seriously.`
` We're a little too high‐strung."`
`"Aunt Natsuhi......`
` Where are you going...?"`
`"This search for alibis and culprits is truly ludicrous...!`
` When the typhoon passes and the police arrive, everything will be exposed to the light of day.`
` There's no reason whatsoever for us to play detectives.`
` Am I wrong, Erika‐san?"`
`"Generally speaking, you would be right.`
` However, I have the authority to do this."`
`Who gave her that authority?`
` No one asked.`
`It was an authority given by words of power from a higher world,`
` so the pieces weren't even allowed to doubt it...`
`"I will take my leave.`
` I have no intention of playing along with your pointless questioning until the police are here.`
` If you suspect me, feel free to do so.`
` I will leave it to the police to investigate that and clear my name."`
`.........It may be a bit late to mention this, but—well, no, this happens every time.`
`As usual, the phone couldn't connect to the police.`
`Natsuhi said the police would come, but that wasn't exactly true.`
`Strictly speaking, the boat to pick them up would come tomorrow, and they would be able to use the radio on that boat to contact the police.`
`Well, ......it's not like I'll let everyone live that long anyway.`
`...*giggle*.`
`"......Natsuhi‐san, it's dangerous to be alone...`
` Perhaps it would be better if you......"`
`"Why not let her?`
` That might make for some excellent proof.`
` If Natsuhi nee‐san gets murdered in her own room, that'll be excellent proof of her innocence."`
`"Quit it, Aneki.`
` .........It's probably best if we all get a bit of rest.`
` Our bodies won't last until tomorrow."`
`"Rest is fine, but let's not let our guard down, okay...?`
` We might not make it through the night, much less tomorrow."`
`"............Aunt Natsuhi.`
` If you're returning to your room, make sure you lock it tight, close the windows and shutters, and stay safe.`
` ......I don't want to suspect anyone.`
` And more than that, ......I don't want there to be any more victims."`
`".........Thank you, Battler‐kun.`
` .........Then I'll return to my room.`
` Gohda, you're in charge now.`
` I know this is a horrible situation, but make sure that the guests at least have everything they need."`
`"Y‐yes, Madam......`
` I shall do so......"`
`With everyone watching her, Natsuhi left the parlor.`
`From their faces, she could tell that they were expecting the classic mystery pattern...`
`that the first person to quarrel and leave the circle would become the next victim.`
`............Natsuhi......couldn't disobey because of the threat against Krauss, who had been taken as a hostage.`
`Very soon, it would be {nobr:1 p.m.}, the time that had been arranged.`
`She was to hide for an hour in the closet of a specific guest room.`
`It was easy to suspect that this bizarre order was a trap to select her as the next sacrifice.`
`She thought of various ways to resist,`
` but all methods would be useless against a culprit who had a hostage and was observing her from close by...`
`So Natsuhi could do nothing but obediently follow his orders,`
` and then claim that she had been forced to do this for her husband's safety...`
`As the arranged time had drawn near,`
` Natsuhi had intentionally acted annoyed and smashed the cup on the ground to give her an excuse for slipping out of the parlor.`
`.........At any rate, no matter how cowardly a trap it may be, ......I cannot disobey now.`
`I am now the one who carries the burden of the One‐winged Eagle.`
`......Now that my husband, Krauss, has been captured,`
` I must protect it even if I have to crawl through the mud...`
`".............................."`
`......Of course, I am prepared to do that.`
` I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi.`
`Even if I am not permitted to bear the One‐winged Eagle on my clothes,`
` .........Father gave me permission to bear it in my heart......`
`".............................."`
`......I think dashing away in a rage got me here without raising too much suspicion.`
`So far......everything has gone well.`
`Before my eyes was the doorknob of the specified guest room.`
`{n}......However, ...I wondered about the lock.`
`The servants are under orders to always lock any unused rooms.`
`......What will I do if it's locked...?`
`I dashed out of the parlor pretending that I was returning to my room.`
`Going back and asking a servant to unlock this guest room would be obviously suspicious...`
`If possible, ......I'd like to get this eerie hide‐and‐seek over with without anyone noticing.`
`In that phone call from the one who claimed to be a man from 19 years ago,`
` he said that I would win if no one found me, but lose if anyone did find me.`
`He said that he'd release my husband whether I won or lost,`
` ......but as a person with a hostage taken against me, I'd rather not lose...`
`I don't like it at all, but I have to go along with this game.`
`I softly gripped the doorknob, ......and I could feel that it was unlocked.`
`Did Shannon or Kumasawa forget to lock it after cleaning?`
`......Or did that man unlock it in advance......?`
`That man...`
`...couldn't be waiting for me in this room, could he?`
`And then...`
`...he'll...`
`........................`
`All that about hide‐and‐seek might have been just an excuse.`
`I kept the fact that I was coming here secret, and all of the other people think I'm resting in my room.`
`If I were to be killed in this situation, in this room,`
` ......it might create a new baffling murder case, like an extension of the one which occurred this morning.`
`".........I‐...if that's what he's up to, so much the better.`
` ...It will be a good chance to confront the culprit directly..."`
`Natsuhi had some experience with using a {ruby:Japanese polearm:naginata}, but only from casual lessons.`
`Unlike Eva, she couldn't brag about being able to hold off any single ruffian indefinitely.`
`As she was now, she had no realistic chance of prevailing over a man with malicious intent on her own, and no weapons that could make that possible.`
`".............................."`
`She readied herself......and slowly opened the door.`
`She couldn't afford to stand around in the corridor and risk being seen by someone...`
`The atmosphere inside the guest room......was ice‐cold,`
` and she could sense no trace of a person waiting impatiently for her.`
`All she could hear were the unsettling sounds of the wind and rain.`
`At first, that seemed to be proof that no one existed to threaten her,`
` ......but before long, it only stirred up the uneasy feeling inside her all the more...`
`The closet was just off to the side of anyone entering the room.`
`Lined up inside it was a set of hangers where guests could hang their coats.`
`This closet, which had nothing hanging in it, was large enough for even an adult to hide in...`
`She softly opened the closet.`
` ......Of course, there was nothing inside.`
`She would have to hide quietly in here for an hour.`
`The room had a wood floor, but something like a carpet had been laid in the closet.`
`......It seemed that sitting down wouldn't be a problem.`
`She had been sure that someone would be waiting for her in this room,`
` or that a strange letter would be lying in the closet.`
`......She had even imagined the worst, that her husband's corpse might be inside.`
`However, none of these things she imagined turned out to be true.`
`All that was here was a cold guest room...`
`and a lifeless closet which silently urged her to go inside......`
`"............And he told me...to hide in here for an hour...`
` ......He's making fun of me."`
`Natsuhi shrugged, turned around, then locked and chained the guest room door.`
`"This way, no one will be able to get into this room.`
` ......In other words, no one will be able to find me for the next hour.`
` I win.`
` What a stupid game of hide‐and‐seek."`
`This would certainly result in a total victory in the hide‐and‐seek game against that mystery man.`
`......However, it was such an easy victory, it made her feel uneasy.`
`This is normally against the rules of hide‐and‐seek...`
`......Even if I win, won't this displease the culprit?`
`And everyone thinks I'm in my room right now.`
`If they find a room with a chain set, that will be an impossible locked room to them.`
`Erika was dashing around the mansion to confirm everyone's alibi.`
`If she notices that the chain is set on this room, there will probably be an uproar which will end in them cutting the chain and searching the room.`
`......If that happens, I'll be found hiding in the closet right away.`
`It would be easy for me to honestly confess why I was hiding.`
`But that man insisted that I not reveal that.`
`......If I tell them, ......I might be endangering my husband...`
`Thinking of it that way, setting the chain.........no, even locking the door might be a bad idea.`
`That's right.`
` This room was unlocked when I came here.`
`If it were to suddenly become locked, it's conceivable that it might catch someone's attention.`
`......It's better if I don't do anything unnecessary...`
`{n}That man only told me to hide......`
`"............So in the end, ...I have no choice...but to do what he says......"`
`I hate doing it, ......but I can't disobey.`
`I undid both of those two precious locks,`
` ......went into the dimly lit closet filled with the smell of old wood, and managed to close the door from the inside.`
`......Pitch black.`
`It reminded me of when I was young, when I used to hide somewhere and then surprise my mother,`
` but that peaceful recollection wasn't enough to kill off my anxiety.`
`It really is pitch black.`
`From in here, I won't even be able to check my watch to see if an hour has passed.`
`I'll probably need to open the door a crack every once in a while to let in enough light for my watch.`
`......For now, .........I sat down and folded my legs.`
`I thought about holding my knees to my chest, but it hurt my back when I tried.`
`I'm not as young as I used to be.`
`Even though I and the rest of my class were made to sit on the floor clasping our knees in every PE class as grade schoolers,`
` I now have to struggle just to sit down.`
`Just sitting down here for an hour...`
`will probably hurt a lot......`
`"........................haah............"`
`I can't believe.........he expects me to sit in the darkness for a full hour, listening only to the wind and the rain.`
`Ironically, Natsuhi had made Jessica do the exact same thing in the past.`
`She had done it to scold Jessica's persistent bad habits and teach her a lesson when she was a little girl.`
`She had thought that making Jessica stay put in the darkness would sprout a desire to reflect on her mistakes,`
` and that, this way, she would understand what she had done wrong.`
`......To Natsuhi, it almost felt like......she was being made to do the same thing.`
`If that was the true purpose of this hide‐and‐seek......`
`.......................................`
`"......How naive of me."`
`This must be my naivety, the hope that if his goal is to make me repent,`
` nothing will happen here during this hour...`
`Uncertainty and fear of that man's shadow are not what I need right now.`
`Will someone suddenly come to this room, open this closet,`
` ......and do something horrible to me now that I've come here in total secrecy as promised?`
`......That's what I should be worrying about.`
`The culprit, ......or one of his accomplices, is very close by.`
`{n}If they weren't, they wouldn't be able to observe me so thoroughly.`
`I don't want to think it, but it's highly likely that the culprit bought off one of the servants.`
`The culprit was able to hide an eerie card with "autumn" written on it in my room.`
`My personal room is always locked.`
`{n}That trick wouldn't have been possible without a key.`
`Instead of believing that they obtained the key when the servants weren't looking,`
` it's much more realistic to assume that one of the servants lent the culprit a hand...`
`"Still,`
` .........h‐how...`
`......did they know that autumn is my favorite season.........?`
` .........How ghastly........."`
`The thought that this mystery man might be peeking into my heart sent goosebumps running across my whole body...`
`It's true that I like autumn, but I've never said that out loud.`
`{n}I don't think anyone's ever asked me, either.`
`......I could even ask my husband what my favorite season is and he would probably be stuck for an answer.`
`............N‐no.`
`{n}There was one time, one time I told it to a single person.........`
`That's right.`
` ...............Shannon...`
`On an autumn day long ago, I happened to be in a good mood,`
` and I mentioned that autumn was my favorite of the four seasons.`
`......I can't believe it... Then the culprit, or one of their accomplices, has to be Shannon...!`
`"Only Shannon could know that I like autumn...`
` ......In that case, ......this is clear proof that Shannon is involved...!`
` That card with "autumn" on it is proof...!`
` ......Incredible...`
` After ten years of being provided for by our family........."`
`I trembled and shook with rage.`
`......Didn't Kinzo once say that the emotion of anger...`
`is the fastest sedative to cure fear and uncertainty?`
`It's easy to tell the most fearful humans from within a crowd.`
`They're always the first to get angry.`
`......I remember him telling me that.`
`So I realized that this anger was a sign that I was actually frightened,`
` and I tried my best to remain calm...`
`......However, this is a fascinating clue that I can use to turn things around.`
`Shannon may not be reliable as a servant,`
` but if she's the accomplice used by that mystery man, this might actually be convenient.`
`She's a timid girl.`
` If I threaten her, she'll probably spill the name of the mastermind in an instant.`
`I'll tell the police about this in secret.`
`{n}I'm certain it will be a big clue that will help in arresting the culprit.`
`"......That card was probably meant to surprise me and control me,`
` ......but he's actually dug his own grave."`
`{a:c:`
`{p:1:I never told anyone except Shannon that I like autumn}.}`
`This is unshakable proof that she's working with the culprit......`
`Though I'd thought this time in the closet would crush me with uncertainty and uneasiness, it had actually given me the start of a counterattack.`
`If I hadn't been given this time in the darkness, I probably wouldn't have noticed this.`
`I felt almost grateful to the culprit for making up this foolish game.`
`......My mood brightened.`
`...I still couldn't guarantee that my husband was safe, but I was determined to take him back and force the culprit to face judgment...`
`I gripped my fists tightly, and further strengthened my resolve to avoid losing this fight at any cost...`
`Rattle, rattle!!`
`At that moment, I heard the sudden sound of someone trying to force a locked door open,`
` and my heart leapt.`
`"......Oh, it was unlocked."`
`The voice was Hideyoshi's.`
`{n}I heard a quiet voice, as though he was talking to himself, coming from what was probably the hallway.`
`Apparently, he had thought it was locked and tried to unlock it,`
` but had ended up locking the unlocked door instead.`
`Once again, there was the sound of the lock turning, and this time, the door opened with a faint sound......`
`......Why...`
`...is Hideyoshi‐san in this room......?!`
`Footsteps which sounded like his came in, and there was the sound of him closing and locking the door behind him.`
`Then came what seemed to be the sound of him setting the chain.`
`.........Don't tell me...`
`...Hideyoshi‐san...`
`...is the mastermind...?!`
`{n}Or else, an accomplice...?!`
`Is he planning to do something to me in this room...?`
`The door may only be locked from the inside, but it will still take some time to remove the chain.`
`......If Hideyoshi‐san doesn't intend to let me escape from here,`
` there's no chance he'll give me time to fumble around with the chain...`
`In that case.........`
`......when he opens the closet door wide in just a moment...`
`...and looks down upon me sitting here pathetically,`
` ......just what kind of horrifying words will he say...?`
`I don't want to be found, I don't want to be found...`
`{n}I beg you, pass right on by the closet door...`
`{n}Please keep going into the center of the room......!`
`My head was filled almost to bursting with a throbbing sound so loud that I almost missed hearing his noisy footsteps.`
`So when I heard a clunking sound coming from the center of the room,`
` I finally realized that he'd passed by the closet, and was deeply relieved.`
`"......Just in case.`
` Can't tell if it's day or night in this weather anyway."`
`As he muttered, he did something that made a clunking sound.`
`{n}......He was probably closing the shutters on the windows.`
`Just in case?`
`{n}In case I try to escape out the window...?`
`No, ......that can't be it.`
`That's right.`
`When I left the parlor, everyone was talking about possibly taking a break.`
`After all, several murders had occurred.`
` And the weather was bad.`
`{n}......There would be nothing abnormal about resting in a guest room here instead of returning to the guesthouse.`
`In that case, locking up and closing the shutters to guarantee safety was the proper course of action to take.`
`When he finished closing the shutters,`
` ......there was a thunk`
` as though he had flopped over on the bed.`
`......It was surprising how much of the situation could be grasped just by the sound.`
`.........What's going on here......?`
`Did the man from 19 years ago......plan all this out to put me in the same room as Hideyoshi‐san...?`
`No, ......that probably...isn't true.`
`Clearly he planned on me hiding here,`
` ......but Hideyoshi‐san coming to take a rest here must have been outside the scope of his plan.`
`Thinking about it that way, .........having him in the room...`
`might help to secure my own safety in an odd sort of way.`
`......Unlike his wife, Hideyoshi‐san is the kind of person I can talk to.`
`{n}If Eva‐san comes, things will probably get complicated.`
`Maybe I should slip out of this closet now while he's still alone,`
` reveal everything just to him, and ask for help......`
`But if I do that, my husband might be killed...`
`It isn't wise to do anything rash until my husband is released......`
`Should I go out and talk, or hide in here?`
`Moaning from my headache and biting my lower lip, I resisted the temptation to crawl out of here...`
`Even if I talk with Hideyoshi‐san, I don't know where my husband is being held.`
` I'm sure the informant who's observing me is nearby as well.`
`Just talking to him won't solve everything.`
`......I suspect that Shannon is an informant, but that doesn't mean that Gohda and the others aren't.`
`......It's no good......`
` Leaving here and confessing is just too dangerous...`
`Eventually, ......I heard a strange, sobbing voice.`
`......Whose voice was it......?`
`I strained my ears, trying to hear that strange voice,`
` .........and was shocked to discover that it was Hideyoshi weeping...`
`Now that he was all alone like this, Hideyoshi, ......who had lost his only son,`
` was finally able to shed tears and cry...`
`......Thinking that he needed to support Eva in her distress, he had acted as though he alone was standing firm.`
`However, he had as good a right as anyone to cry.`
`......And now that he had found a place where no one could see his tears,`
` he was finally allowing himself to let it out...`
`............I've...`
`...lost my daughter too.`
`...I haven't seen her body with my own eyes, ......so it still doesn't really feel like she's dead.`
`But if the one who carried her off was the culprit...`
`and he had some repulsive motive for doing it, ......just thinking about it makes me feel as though my chest will tear itself apart...`
`The reason I'm hiding in here now is that I'm thinking more about my still living husband than my dead daughter.`
`......But if I were given the chance, ...I'd be wailing at the top of my lungs too.`
`However, ......I still can't let myself do that.`
`......That isn't because the man from 19 years ago told me to hide.`
`It's because............I am the final...head of the Ushiromiya family......`
`It's been completely overshadowed by all of this,`
` ......but last night, Battler‐kun found the hidden gold and even gained the Head's Ring from that mysterious envelope.`
`.........At the very, very end, when it's all over...`
`{n}I probably won't be able to prevent him from inheriting the family headship.`
`And when everything regarding the distribution of the inheritance is revealed,`
` ......the Ushiromiya family honor and glory passed down from Father.........will plummet to the earth.`
`So, ......I am the final head.`
`Battler‐kun will probably inherit the remaining wealth of the Ushiromiya family.`
`However, its history and honor......will all end with my generation......`
`Therefore, ......I am the final head.`
`{n}I must not cry.`
` .........Not yet.`
`Until I get my husband back......and avenge my daughter, I will not be allowed to shed tears......`
`As I listened to Hideyoshi‐san's sobs from the closet,`
` I silently hung my head......`
`"Wh‐who are you...?!"`
`Huh?!`
`My heart leapt.`
`Hideyoshi‐san, who must have been lying prostrate on the bed, made a sound as though he had bounded to his feet.`
`......D‐......did he notice me......?`
`"How did you get in here......?`
` ......Wh‐...what's that...?`
` ......W‐wait a second...!`
` Wai.........ngahh, ......mmpph—"`
`He was clearly in a struggle with someone.`
`......Who could it be?!`
` No, it doesn't matter who it is.`
`It's probably the culprit, and they're probably trying to take Hideyoshi‐san's life at this very moment...!`
`Shouldn't I jump out of here and help him...?`
`{n}Even if I couldn't help him, I could at least call for help......`
`...No, but...if I do something like that, I'll be questioned about why I was hiding here...!`
`However, if Hideyoshi‐san goes on to get killed now......`
`No, now isn't the time to be saying that...`
`{n}At this rate, he'll definitely be killed...!`
`I'll jump out of here and help him right now...!`
`Aaah, but if I do that, even if I can save Hideyoshi‐san, ......I might be abandoning my husband's life.`
`Hideyoshi‐san's life and my husband's life.`
`{n}......How sinful it would be to try to weigh those against each other...!!`
`Just then, there was a loud sound of the door opening and the chain being pulled tight.`
`Someone was trying to open the door despite the chain being set.`
`"Honey, it's me.`
` Could you open up?"`
`"......Eva, ......aah, gwaaaaaaggghhhh...!!"`
`"Honey?`
` ...What?! What's happening?!`
` Honey?!`
` Open up!!"`
`"Ggh......`
`............gggh`
`............ggh........."`
`"Open up!`
` Open up, honey!!`
` S‐someooooooooooone!!"`
`She opened and closed the door over and over again with all her might, but of course, she couldn't snap the chain.`
`Eva‐san raced down the hallway calling for help in a loud voice......`
`By this time, the room had settled back into silence,`
` ......and that earlier feeling of Hideyoshi being in a noisy struggle had disappeared completely.`
`What's.........going on here......?!`
`So, right now, ......I'm in the same room as the murderer who killed Hideyoshi‐san......?!`
`In that case, the culprit should try to escape from the room as soon as possible, ......so why are they staying so quiet in here...?!`
`I haven't heard anything,`
` ......nothing that might have been the culprit who attacked Hideyoshi‐san rushing away.`
`......No matter how much I strain my ears, I can't sense anyone in the room.`
`In fact, ......it's so silent that it makes what happened just a second ago feel like an illusion.`
`In other words, .........does this mean......that the culprit is holding his breath,`
` standing right in front of this closet...`
`waiting for me to shamelessly come out......?`
`I don't even know what to be scared of anymore.`
`If only I could just melt away into the darkness of this closet...!`
`I mustn't remain in this room any longer.`
`{n}I get the feeling I have more to worry about than just my personal safety...`
`But what should I do?!`
`I don't even know if it's a good idea to leave this closet...!!`
`Before long, the clamor of many rushing footsteps approached.`
`I held my breath again and melted away into the darkness of the closet......`
`Eva dashed back, bringing everyone with her.`
`Gohda was gripping a bolt cutter.`
`{n}It was to cut the chain with.`
`After trying to open the door again and confirming that the chain was still set, she yelled through the crack in the door.`
`"Honey!!`
` We're going to open this up...!!`
` Cut it right now!!"`
`"Y‐yes...!"`
`Gohda stuck the large bolt cutter, which looked like it could slice off whole fingers,`
` into the crack in the door and easily severed the chain.`
`"Dear!!"`
`As soon as it was severed, Eva pushed Gohda aside and dashed in.`
`The others tried to follow her, .........but they bumped into Eva, who had fallen to her knees, moaning.`
`So even though they couldn't tell much of what was going on inside the room,`
` ...they could tell by Eva's moans that they were too late......`
`"......What the hell......"`
`"Honey...!! Honey{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}yyy!!`
` Doctor Nanjo!!`
` Look at my husband...! Quickly!!"`
`"I, I'll do it right now......"`
`"You've got to be kidding me......`
` ...It's only been about ten minutes since Uncle Hideyoshi went out saying he wanted to rest......"`
`"......Is there anyone in the bathroom?"`
`"N‐no...!`
` There's no one here!"`
`"What could have happened, ...aaaaaahhhh......"`
`"Honey!!`
` Honey{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}yyy...!!"`
`".........I'm afraid to say...that there's nothing I can do......"`
`Nanjo stood up, hanging his head sadly.`
`It was only natural.`
`Because anyone, even if they weren't a doctor, would think that at a glance.`
`......Hideyoshi......was lying face down on the bed.`
`And stuck deep into his back.........was something like a blade with an intricate demonic design on it.`
`When Eva pulled it out with all her might,`
` they could tell that it wasn't a blade, but some kind of stake.`
`And its sharp tip had penetrated nearly fifteen centimeters in.`
`It had probably dug deep into the lungs.`
`......If it had been stuck in any harder, the tip might even have pierced all the way through to the surface of his chest......`
`"Didn't I tell you to wait for me?!!`
` Why did you go on alone...?!!`
` Stupid, stupid,`
` stupiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiid!!`
` Uwaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhh!!"`
`"......The culprit probably waited for us to get careless and split up......"`
`"That bastard......`
` So he still hasn't had enough blood...?!"`
`"So he really is......hiding somewhere in this mansion...`
`...and coming after us......?"`
`"But there's something strange here.`
` ......The doors and windows to this room are completely sealed."`
`"............ah.`
` ...Th‐that's right.`
` The shutters are all shut, and the chain was on the door until a second ago......"`
`"Huh?!`
` Isn't that bizarre...?!`
` In that case, how did the culprit attack Hideyoshi‐san in this room...?!"`
`"Perhaps they threw this stake through the crack in the door......!"`
`"Hideyoshi‐san's bed is in a total blind spot from this crack.`
` You couldn't even kill him with a gun.`
` .........This really is strange.`
` It's a locked‐room murder."`
`"A, ......a locked‐room murder......"`
`"......It's a bit too early to be sure about that.`
` Maybe the culprit removed the ceiling in the bathroom and escaped to the space above it, or maybe you can close the shutters from outside."`
`"The shutters.`
` ............They didn't budge an inch from the outside.`
` I just went and checked."`
`"......Erika........."`
`It was no wonder everything felt so quiet and relaxed.`
`{n}At some point, Erika had split from the group.`
`Just now, she had finally arrived and poked her face in from the hallway.`
`......She had heard that a crime had occurred in this room,`
` seen everyone rushing towards it, and taken the opposite approach by circling around to the outer wall.`
`And she had gone all by herself to check that the shutters were down on the windows, that you couldn't do anything with them from the outside,`
` ......and that there was nothing out of the ordinary.`
`"I assume that the inside of the room is perfectly cliché......?"`
`"......That was uncalled for."`
`"You have my deepest condolences.`
` So? What is the state of the room?"`
`"..........................."`
`"......The chain was set on the door, so we cut it and entered."`
`"And all the windows have the shutters down.`
` They're locked tight from the inside."`
`"......What are they bickering about in there?"`
`Eva was arguing with Nanjo about something.`
`Apparently, she wanted to carry the body to the parlor.`
`Nanjo tried to calm her, saying that they should leave the crime scene as untouched as possible until the police came.`
`"What happened to the other corpses when we did that?!`
` The culprit carried them off somewhere!`
` It may be that the culprit isn't satisfied with just killing, but intends to do something with the bodies as well...!!`
` So no way!`
` No way we're leaving my husband all alone here!!"`
`Eva did have a point.`
`After all, the prior victims were all carried away after we were shown their terrible and fatal wounds.`
`"......Erika‐chan.`
` ...You'd probably like to preserve the crime scene, but could you just let this one slide...?"`
`"........................`
` ...Do as you wish.`
` All I'm interested in is the fact that a locked room has appeared that's much more serious than Kinzo‐san's study.`
` I have no interest in corpses, so do as you please."`
`"....................."`
`Battler looked at her with an expression of clear disgust,`
` ......but it rolled off her like water off a duck's back.`
`"......Well? You can take the corpse away now, I don't mind.`
` Or am I in the way?"`
`Erika backed away from the door to open a path.`
`......There was no trace of any sadness for the dead.`
`{n}Her eyes simply blazed at the thought of this locked‐room murder that had appeared.`
`In any event, the great detective had given her permission.`
`......Eva and some others wrapped Hideyoshi's body up in the sheets, and Gohda and Rudolf started to carry him out...`
`The sheets quickly turned red.`
`It was so painful to see that Shannon and Kumasawa stripped the blanket off the bed to further cover the body...`
`"......Hey, out of the way."`
`"Yes, I am out of the way."`
`"Let's carry him to the parlor."`
`"Y‐yes...!"`
`"Honey, honeyyy{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y, awaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ahhhhh...!!"`
`"......Listen up, everyone.`
` From now on, we'll always move as a group.`
` You must not let yourself be isolated."`
`"The culprit probably got a master key when he attacked Genji‐san.`
` It's clear that locking up will no longer keep us safe."`
`"B‐but...even the chain was set. How did they do it......?!"`
`"......It's impossible...`
` The shutters and the chain were firmly set.`
` ......Even with a master key, it's impossible to force your way into that room......!"`
`"It must have been {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's doing.........oooohhhhh......"`
`"......Th‐there's no way {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama did this...`
` ......The epitaph has been solved, so there shouldn't be any more reason to hold the ritual..."`
`"As if we could understand her reasons...`
` This is impossible for anyone except a witch...!"`
`"......Impossible for anyone except a witch...you say?`
` <Good>!`
` That has a nice ring to it."`
`"Erika‐chan, are you listening?`
` We've decided to stick together from now on.`
` First, we're carrying Hideyoshi‐san's body to the parlor.`
` Can you hold off playing detective until we get there?"`
`"........................"`
`When she heard the words "playing detective", Erika grimaced visibly.`
`Then, after everyone had filed out, she took a single step into the now empty guest room,`
` .........looked around, and burned the scene into her eyes.`
`......Erika claimed to have a photographic memory.`
`If that was true, those few seconds were more than enough for her.`
`Later on, she could sip black tea in the parlor while perusing her mental photographs of the crime scene,`
` and enjoy playing the part of the armchair detective...`
`Then, suddenly, her eyes stopped on the closet off to the side.`
`......A closet for hanging overcoats.`
`If it was large enough to fit a coat on a hanger,`
` .........a person should be able to hide in it............`
`Slowly, ............Erika...`
`...stretched her hand out towards the closet............`
`".........ah—"`
`Erika's shoulder was grabbed roughly from behind.`
`"......Let's go, Ms. Detective.`
` Didn't they teach you to stick with the group on school field trips?"`
`"Well, whenever I go traveling, someone always dies."`
`"Hey, what do you think you're doing, brats?!`
` Move it...!!"`
`Rudolf told them to hurry.`
`After clicking her tongue and glaring at the closet, Erika followed Battler back to the parlor for the time being...`
`.........The sound of their footsteps finally faded.`
`That time of terror,`
` when I feared that even the dripping of the cold sweat that covered my cheeks might be noticed, was finally......over.`
`I slowly opened the closet door with hands that still couldn't stop trembling and dashed out into the hallway.`
`It's alright, no one's found me......`
`{n}Still, it's a good thing they didn't lock the door...`
`If they had, I wouldn't be able to lock behind me after I left, and they'd find that suspicious...`
`Anyway, I should leave this place.`
`Then I'll return to my room and pretend that I was sleeping the whole time...`
`That's right, I have to get back quickly...`
`A new murder has occurred.`
`{n}They'll probably try to tell me about it.`
`And they'll probably do it immediately after they carry Hideyoshi‐san's body back to the parlor.`
`I can get around a phone call by saying I was asleep and didn't notice, but if they come knocking directly, that'll be bad...`
`I have to get back quickly, before they try to force their way in......`
`I don't even know whether I should sprint back noisily to save every second I can, sneak back with hushed footsteps,`
` or walk around normally as though I don't know anything has happened......!`
`The one thing I'm certain of is that I have to avoid bumping into them on their way back to the parlor.`
`I have to get to my room......at a quick pace, without being noticed by anyone......!`
`I passed through the hall...`
`...to the lobby.`
`Once I've ascended the main staircase in the lobby, ......I'll be almost there......`
`{a:c:`
`"Natsuhi‐san."}`
`"Hyeek......!!"`
`Just as she was about to go up the large staircase, Natsuhi heard Erika call out to her,`
` and was so surprised that she visibly jumped.`
`"......I was just about to go tell you."`
`"Th‐thank you very much.`
` Did something happen......?"`
`".........Natsuhi‐san, were you just...`
`going up the stairs...?`
` Your room {i:is} upstairs, isn't it......?"`
`Erika coldly pointed out this strange fact.`
`{n}......Natsuhi cursed her bad luck.`
`"I, ...I couldn't sleep, so I was going to return to the parlor,`
` ......b‐but I wasn't sure whether I had locked my room or not, so I was about to head back.`
` ......I'm a worrier, so this sort of thing happens a lot.`
` Don't worry about it..."`
`"Ah, of course, that is quite common, isn't it?`
` It's a common quirk among people who aren't confident in their ability to remember things."`
`Erika was clearly making fun of her, and Natsuhi might have put on an annoyed expression under normal circumstances.`
`However, right now,`
` Natsuhi was extremely relieved to hear Erika admit that this was nothing out of the ordinary...`
`"Why are you by yourself, Erika‐san......?"`
`"I thought I might examine that guest room."`
`"Guest room......?"`
`"Yes.`
` Things have gotten pretty serious, haven't they?`
` And investigating the scene of the crime is my right."`
`......Erika's probing gaze peered deep into Natsuhi's eyes.`
`She could tell.`
`{n}Erika was already suspicious of Natsuhi.`
`......Judging by the subtle nuances of her words,`
` this was almost certainly an attempt to make Natsuhi slip up and reveal that she knew about the Hideyoshi murder she hadn't yet been told about.`
`Natsuhi played dumb and asked again what had happened.`
`"..........................."`
`"..............................`
` ......I‐...is something wrong...?"`
`"No, I was just thinking.`
` ......This is a repeat of the first crime, isn't it?"`
`"What do you mean...?"`
`"Again, you were in your room.`
` And again, you can't prove your alibi, can you?"`
`"......I don't know what you mean.`
` To turn it around, how can you prove that I wasn't in my room...?"`
`"Oh, an interesting response.`
` Then let's take this one step at a time.`
` ......Please worry about your lock later.`
` I have something vitally important to discuss with everyone."`
`"I'll come back after I check my lock.`
` Please get started without me."`
`"......Hideyoshi‐san has been killed.`
` We'll be talking about that."`
`"Wh‐.........what...?!"`
`She had planned on escaping to her own room using her lock as an excuse,`
` ......claiming to have a sudden headache, and staying in bed the rest of the time.`
`However, now that she had been informed of Hideyoshi's murder,`
` it would be clearly suspicious to say that could wait and escape to her room.`
`......She was already under suspicion after being seen heading up the stairs to the second floor.`
`She couldn't afford to do anything else suspicious......`
`Natsuhi gave up and headed for the parlor as Erika had urged her to do...`
`When she opened the door to the parlor, Eva's sobs poured out.`
`And everyone stared at Natsuhi with grave faces.`
`Those gazes almost made it look......as though they suspected her.`
`It was now painfully apparent to Natsuhi.`
`{n}This must have been what that man was after.`
`It was a trap to create a baffling locked‐room murder......and frame her for it.`
`But I couldn't disobey.`
` I couldn't sacrifice my husband's life...!`
`And while it's true that I was hiding in the closet, that was all.`
`I haven't committed murder!`
`I might fall under enormous suspicion, but I'm still not the culprit.`
`And most importantly, I'm not under suspicion yet.`
`......I'll tell the police everything.`
` I'll have to endure until then.`
`I'm sure one of the servants is feeding information to the culprit.`
`Even in a situation like this, if I talk about my husband being a hostage,`
` the culprit will hear, and it might be used as an excuse to kill him......`
`"Natsuhi‐san has just come back.`
` Now that we're all here, I have something very important to discuss with you all."`
`"......Something very important......?"`
`"Yes, it's very important.`
` ......Here in front of you all, I would like to set out the facts of everything that's happened, from the first crime to the last."`
`"Then you can leave me out of it, if you please.`
` I think we should leave that sort of thing to the police.`
` I'm not interested."`
`"I have something very important to say once I've cleared everything up.`
` Neither you nor anyone else has the right to refuse."`
`"Wha............"`
`Erika used her detective's authority to proclaim the start of an assembly.`
`{n}None of the pieces could disobey.`
`Praying that she wouldn't become the topic of conversation, Natsuhi reluctantly sat on the sofa as she'd been urged to.`
`".........Oh, sorry.`
` Could you close that door for me?"`
`""Y‐yes...""`
`Shannon and Kanon closed the door.`
`......Since they had just now decided to lock all doors and windows carefully, Kanon locked it as well.`
`The lock which existed to protect the safety of this room...`
`felt like a lock on a prison cell to Natsuhi—one that would hold her there and prevent any escape......`
`......Natsuhi still hadn't noticed.`
`That ever since Erika had left into the corridor to go check the crime scene in Hideyoshi's room......her goal had changed.`
`In short, from Erika's point of view, the sound of that lock was truly...`
`"Checkmate."`
`Erika said that suddenly.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} said that suddenly.`
`"Oh, fast!`
` Wow, so you've figured out the culprit already?`
` We've barely gotten to any of the crimes, you know?`
` You could've let me kill a few more and gathered all kinds of clu~es."`
`".........Alright, Lambda, gather all of the pieces.`
` Now we're getting to the most entertaining part.`
` Let's both enjoy it to the fullest."`
`"We'll see about that...`
` Why don't you show me what you've got?`
` *giggle*giggle*...!!"`
`"To think that she'd lay down the challenge without waiting for the game to be over at midnight...!`
` What a hasty person, that Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}...!"`
`"It is quite an early challenge.`
` To think that she already feels she can win at this stage..."`
`"......Claiming a witch exists is normally all you need to do to win,`
` ......but with Natsuhi and Kinzo, we've got a lot we need to protect this time.`
` ......Sounds like this fight'll be a pain."`
`"I welcome a troublesome fight!`
` I won't let them do as they please with my golden island any more...!!`
` I shall meet your challenge, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}!`
` Furudo Erika!"`
`......In the Golden Land, the endless rain continued to fall.`
`Battler was nowhere to be seen.`
`It would very soon reach the time when Battler had joined in on the fifth game,`
` and control of his piece would be passed on to him.`
`In other words, only now, in this final stage of the game when {f:5:Bernkastel} had pinpointed the culprit,`
` was Battler finally going to be allowed to participate.`
`He had left the arbor a short while ago for that reason.`
`Now, the only ones in sight were {f:5:Virgilia}, who continued to knit silently,`
` ......and Beato, ...who just sat there blankly amidst the smell of her black tea,`
` not even putting the cup to her lips......`
`{f:5:Virgilia} stopped knitting for a moment...`
`...and looked out across the vast golden rose garden that extended as far as the eye could see.`
`"......At least in terms of mere culprit‐guessing games,`
` ......I think we can say that Battler‐kun has gained the strength to never again surrender."`
`"......................................."`
`"You gave him every message he needs by the end of the fourth game.`
` .........That is to say, ......Battler‐kun possesses all the tools to reach the truth at any moment.`
` .........However, he has a weak side.`
` ......Because of that,`
` even if the game goes on to repeat a hundred times,`
` he will never solve it.`
` He'll just wander forever like someone trying to find the blue bird."`
`And that, ............{f:5:Beatrice},`
` goes for you as well.`
`Even if you play this game hundreds more times,`
` you will never arrive at the answer you seek.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} will abuse this game without a doubt.`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} will also churn this game about with the utmost arrogance.`
`At a glance, that may be humiliating and appear to you and Battler as though the game has been stolen from you.`
`.........However.`
`That is something the two of you need right now.`
`To bring an end to Battler's weak side.`
` To bring an end to your hesitation.`
`"And that is why...`
`you called the two of them here.`
` To end the eternal torture between the two of you."`
`"......................................."`
`"Those two will bring you either victory or defeat.`
` But either result will now be one filled with compassion.`
` .........You should understand that as well by now."`
`{f:5:Virgilia} faced Beato, whom she had come to adore like a daughter,`
` ......with cold eyes that she must not have shown often.`
`It was like the gaze of a mother who, instead of scolding, silently urges their child to recognize their mistake.`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` .........How long do you intend to stay there...`
`...neither alive...`
`nor dead,`
` .........not ascending to heaven...`
`nor descending to hell,`
` there in a daze on the peak of Mount Purgatory......?"`
`"......................................."`
`"I am {f:5:Virgilia}.`
` I have guided him through Purgatory and brought him to you at its peak.`
` ......And you are {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` You must choose whether to take his hand and rise up to heaven, or embrace him and fall into hell."`
`Did you know that the tribulations of Purgatory, which lies in the gap between heaven and hell,`
` are sometimes more torturous than even hell itself...?`
`On the gates of hell, it is written that you must abandon all hope.`
`......A human without hope can accept their suffering and give up.`
`However, the denizens of Purgatory have hope.`
`{n}A hope of possibly reaching heaven, a hope that cannot be abandoned.`
`And that tortures them.`
`Even in the depths of hell, ...no greater torture device exists than the single pin known as hope......`
`"Leap.`
` Leap from the cliff of Purgatory.`
` ......Cast open Pandora's box, and cast aside your fleeting, fragile, foolish hope and all the longing it brings.`
` You're afraid, aren't you?`
` Of opening the box."`
`Beato was silent,`
` .........but with a single tear, she nodded slightly.`
`"Is the cat in the box alive or dead?`
` The time has now come...to check.`
` ......If the cat is dead, hold a funeral for it quickly and have it rise to heaven.`
` If the cat is alive, feed it quickly and give it all of your affection."`
`"Whether it is alive or dead,`
` your cat box eternally desecrates the cat.`
` .........Those two have brought you the key to the box that you were too afraid to open."`
`{f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}The time has come for you to die.`
`I hope...`
`that your heart will be stopped...`
`...by the hand of the person you desire.`
