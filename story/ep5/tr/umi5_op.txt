`"You idiot!!`
` Isn't it obvious?!!`
` {i:It'll be fun to kill her and see the pained look on your face, why else}?!!`
` Kuhyahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"Look, look, don't turn your eyes away, look at it.`
` Look look, look look!`
` It's magic, it's furniture, no matter how much you try to deny me and magic, look look, look look look look!`
` Gyahhahhahahaha!!"`
`"......Sorry, Battleer.`
` It was pretty interesting.`
` ...Still, I was just trying to do what Master told me, but it really did work very well!`
` I hear, after acting {ruby:tsuntsun:bad‐tempered} and exploring the depths of cruelty, if you act properly incompetent and {ruby:dere:soft}, you can get a massive rise on that goodwill meter thing, riiight?`
` Kyahahahahahaah!!"`
`That lonely tone was the sound of the desolate wind blowing by.`
`{n}The color of the glittering flower petals on the rose bushes was...that of gold.`
`The group of gold butterflies which had once danced through this golden rose garden like fluttering rose petals...`
`could no longer be seen anywhere...`
`The master of the Golden Land is the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}She could be called inhumane and cruel.`
` Arrogant and outrageous.`
`{n} And also, naive and simple.`
`That laugh of hers, which lost its grace more and more the longer it continued, ......could no longer be heard.`
`The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`sat like a doll, resting in a deck chair adorned as beautifully as the golden rose garden.`
`......She wasn't relaxing there.`
`Empty‐eyed,`
` never responding to any questions,`
` and yet still not permitted to sleep,`
` {f:5:Beatrice} was sitting there as if she was a doll......`
`Her hair was down, and {f:5:Virgilia} was carefully fixing it up with a comb.`
`If {f:5:Beatrice} had been complaining about this and that regarding her hairstyle,`
` then it would have been clear that she was the usual Beato.`
`......However, she gave no responses, and showed no reactions.`
`{n}So instead, it only looked like {f:5:Virgilia} was combing the golden hair of a large doll...`
`Alongside them, there was a table.`
`On it was a chessboard...along with a mix of black and white pieces in an all‐out battle.`
`However, something about this setup looked different from normal chess.`
`{n}...It might have been a game similar to chess but not identical.`
`And on the other side, ......sitting back in his chair as he contemplated his next move, was a young man.`
`...No, perhaps he wasn't thinking of his next move.`
`Every once in a while, he would change the positions of the pieces, reconsidering the situation each time he changed it.`
`Maybe he was reconstructing previous games, trying to discover the thought process behind those moves.`
`In the past...`
`Kinzo, the Ushiromiya family head, once likened studying chess games to taking a journey through the thoughts of the old masters.`
`Ushiromiya Battler...was on a journey.`
`A journey in search of the Golden Witch's thought process...which had led her to create these arrangements and make these moves.`
`Battler took a black piece which he had only just moved forward...and returned it to its original place, sighing deeply.`
`Battler's pieces were white.`
` However, on that chessboard, the side facing Battler was Black's territory.`
` He was stepping through the game from Beato's perspective...`
`"......The more I do this, the less I understand your moves."`
`Even Battler...didn't expect that Beato would respond to that statement.`
`No, ......he was still holding onto the hope that there might be a chance of her responding,`
` and had only made it sound as though he was talking to himself.`
`Beato's eyes......reflected nothing.`
`{n}And her mouth told nothing.`
`"........................"`
`After begging him to kill her,`
` ...the Golden Witch had become a corpse which had given up on living.`
`She wasn't sleeping.`
`{n}......She was forbidden to step down from this game, and therefore, sleep was not permitted.`
`So she must have heard.`
`{n}However, ......his words probably hadn't reached her heart.`
`The Golden Witch would no longer sneer at Battler's moves, nor would she praise them or belittle them.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} was no longer......anything more than a living doll.`
`Even so, she would glance at him every once in a while. It would be an empty glance, but a glance nonetheless.`
`Sometimes, she would seem to make some sort of gesture or even move her lips.`
`However, her movements were never able to communicate anything to Battler......`
`"What led you to make this move in this situation?`
` ......I don't get it at all.`
` I don't understand your moves."`
`"....................."`
`"......Beato.`
` Battler‐kun is talking to you..."`
`"....................."`
`"...Say something.`
` Snicker or guffaw if you want.`
` ......I don't even care if you use that shrill laugh of yours."`
`......It seemed unbelievable.`
` That shrill laugh of Beato's...would never be heard again.`
`However, even if she couldn't answer, his voice was surely reaching her.`
`{n}......Battler was talking to her because he believed this.`
`{n}So he said the same thing one more time...`
`"What led you to make this move in this situation?`
` I don't get it at all.`
` I don't understand your moves."`
`"............`
` ......So, her thoughts don't make any sense to you?"`
`{f:5:Virgilia} answered in her disciple's stead.`
`Up to this point, she had done her best to avoid speaking for Beato.`
`{n}After all, there was a chance that Beato would respond in some way, and {f:5:Virgilia} didn't want to be the one to take that opportunity away from her.`
`......Which meant that Battler was being forced to bear with this silence...`
`...until Beato herself answered.`
`{f:5:Virgilia} could no longer bear to watch him like this...`
`And Battler, too, wanted to have a conversation with {f:5:Virgilia},`
` with faith that their words would reach Beato's heart......`
`"Yep.`
` I don't have a clue.`
` ......The more I try standing in Beato's shoes and moving the pieces like this, the less I understand."`
`The successful execution of a serial murder following an epitaph.`
` He was stepping through the games from the witch side with that as the victory condition,`
` ......but he just couldn't make it fit with Beato's moves.`
`He could see several incomprehensible moves in the records of their past games that clearly conflicted with that victory condition...`
`"......I don't get it at all.`
` This journey through her thinking process is just too rugged."`
`"Even so, you won't give up, will you."`
`"Yeah.`
` .........I promised."`
`{a:c:`
`Kill...me.`
` ......Let me die......}`
`"I promised to let her die peacefully.`
` ......And I'm the only one who can do that."`
`...Beato's right ankle was bound with a heavy, cold, steel shackle.`
`It wasn't tied to anything, so it didn't restrict her movement.`
`However, it symbolized restriction.`
` It was a visualization of the restriction that prevented her from leaving the game without either victory or loss...`
`And...the shackle was probably hurting her.`
`{n}The mercilessly cold steel shackle...`
`was tormenting her over and over inside her waking dream.`
`"............Ghh............ah..."`
`So there was never any relief in her empty expression.`
`{n}Her eyelids would sometimes tremble like she was having a bad dream, ...and every once in a while, she would let out a pained gasp.`
`Unless I win,`
` ......Beato will never be released from the curse that prevents her from resting in peace...`
`"...Are you not in a hurry?`
` It seems that the fifth game has already started."`
`"............`
` ......I'm not interested."`
`Why should I take part in any game without Beato as an opponent...?`
`{n}If that's the only alternative,`
` then stepping through past games on a journey in search of Beato's thought process is a much better use of my time......`
`"I'll be the next Game Master.`
` Any objections?`
` You have none, right?"`
`"......I have tons.`
` Beato has abandoned the fight and lost consciousness.`
` Isn't this loss by default and game over for her...?"`
`"I'll admit a lot's happened to Beato, and it feels a teensy bit like she's been knocked out right now.`
` But that doesn't mean she's lost the will to fight.`
` That's why I'm acting as her assistant.`
` Get it?"`
`Beato was lying down on a deck chair, almost as though she was sleeping.`
`However, she wasn't sleeping,`
` ......and she wasn't awake either.`
`She was nothing more than a living doll who had given up on victory, asked Battler to perform her last rites,`
` and entrusted everything to him...`
`Of course, no fifth game would ever be prepared if everyone just sat around.`
`So, {f:5:Lambdadelta} had succeeded Beato as the Game Master,`
` and proclaimed that she would prepare the next game.`
`"Quit messing around.`
` This game is between me and Beato.`
` I don't know who you two are, but I'm not gonna just let you carry on without us."`
`"No one asked your opinion.`
` So, Bern?`
` Do you accept or not?"`
`"..................`
` ......Sure.`
` Go and succeed her position."`
`"What the hell?! How dare you say that!`
` I don't know who you two are, but I'm not gonna let you ignore Beato and me and just carry on by yourselves!"`
`"Calm down.`
` Of course a different player will choose different moves.`
` You might have a lot of reason to feel uneasy about the idea,`
` but even so, it could give you some big hints, right?"`
`"Who cares?!!`
` And who put you in charge?!!"`
`".........Beato's game has repeated four times, and you still don't understand anything, right?`
` In that case, I think that changing the player might lead to some huge hints."`
`"That's none of your business!`
` This is {i:our} game! Beato prepared it, and she designated me to be her opponent in it.`
` I don't know what hole you two crept out of, but I don't want you screwing things up!"`
`".........In that case, wake Beato up and make her get the next game ready.`
` Can you...?"`
`"B‐...Beato won't be getting up for a while.`
` But there's no need for a new game.`
` Just the four games she's already laid out are more than enough!"`
`"Even if there is to be a fifth game, it just needs to be something that Beato lays out and I challenge.`
` You two have absolutely nothing to do with this!"`
`Battler couldn't hide his irritation at these two witches called {f:5:Lambdadelta} and {f:5:Bernkastel},`
` who had shown up after the game's start and who had started to try and continue it on their own...`
`It looked like these witches were of an even higher rank than Beato—`
`so high, in fact, that even Beato's master {f:5:Virgilia} couldn't come close.`
`Battler had the feeling that he'd seen these two several times before.`
`However, this was the first time he had learned their names and spoken to them directly.`
`"You can't get the next game ready without waking Beato.`
` That's why I'm going to prepare it instead!"`
`"Listen, Battler,`
` we aren't so patient that we're willing to wait however long we have to for Beato to regain consciousness.`
` Right, Bern?"`
`"............I don't like boredom.`
` It really ticks me off."`
`"We really don't care whether you get bored or not."`
`"Come on now.`
` Leave everything to <perfect> {f:5:Lambdadelta}‐sama, okay?`
` I'll take over as the Game Master."`
`"{f:5:Don't worry}, I won't play with too much "certain perfection".`
` I'll {i:act all Beato‐like} and prepare plenty of clues, bonus hints, and fakes that make no sense.`
` I'll make it into one big hint to help you understand Beato's world even more, okay?"`
`Letting my voiceless emotions explode, ...I slammed the table hard.`
`The two witches barely flinched.`
`......One grinned.`
`{n}The other looked indifferent, as though nothing had happened.`
`The two of them just stared at me silently.`
`{n}...As though they were reproaching me.`
`"What's this?`
` Not satisfied?`
` Are you saying you'll step down from my fifth game?`
` Isn't that loss by default?"`
`".........Battler won't step down.`
` Of course he'll participate in the fifth game."`
`"Don't just decide that yourself!!`
` I'm not gonna play along with you two.`
` I don't give a shit!"`
`"Hmmm...`
` ......Then it really is loss by default, right...?`
` The witch side wins this game,`
` the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s submit, and we wrap things up, then...?"`
`".........If you step down, then you lose by default and the game ends... Are you okay with that?`
` .........If you want to make certain that your lonely sister...`
`will always meet with miserable circumstances in an endless number of worlds, that option is indeed open to you."`
`When {f:5:Bernkastel} mentioned Ange, .........Battler's expression changed instantly.`
`"H‐......how dare you...`
`talk about Ange so casually......"`
`".........It's because you have me, the Witch of Miracles {f:5:Bernkastel}, as your ally,`
` ...that there exists the possibility of a {i:miracle} in which Ange's family might come home to her."`
`"Well, if you throw that chance away yourself, guaranteeing that Ange's endless futures will all end in sorrow, that might be pretty interesting for me too."`
`I vaguely understood what she was saying.`
`Until I win in Beato's game, I'll remain trapped in this bizarre world.`
`And if I abandon victory, ......then most certainly, my parents and I will never return to Ange.`
`For Ange's sake, ...even though I know that the witches are toying with me,`
` I must keep on fighting...`
`"Nn, ...d‐.........damn......"`
`".........What's wrong?`
` You look unsatisfied.`
` Did you already forget the anger you felt when your sister was turned into mincemeat......?"`
`"That spectacle where she was torn to bits, ripped to pieces by countless red‐hot pliers.`
` Do you need to look at it directly this time......?"`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} faced the palm of her right hand upwards.`
`{n}...As she did, a pale light gathered there, ......and some kind of blue‐glowing crystal appeared there.`
`......A scene was reflected on its sharp surface,`
` ...but it wasn't the scene that surrounded them now.`
`If you looked deep into that crystal, ......that fragment,`
` then you would probably learn what was reflected on there.`
`If you stared at it,`
` then you would surely witness that scene where Ange.........finally reached her beloved brother after devoting twelve years of her life to that goal,`
` ......only to have her entire body torn to bits while she was still alive.`
`"D‐......damn...you........."`
`Without thinking, he grabbed at her collar,`
` but as soon as he touched whatever made up her form, it disappeared like foam on the waves.`
`And then, as naturally as though she had been there from the beginning,`
` {f:5:Bernkastel} was leaning against a distant wall.`
`".........If you step down from the game,`
` this will become not just a fragment, but a definite reality.`
` I won't be the one to weave that future.`
` You'll do it yourself.`
` ......So you decide, alright?`
` Figure out what you want to do with your beloved little sister's future."`
`Battler's fists shook with anger,`
` ......but even if he swung them down, he wouldn't be able to hit {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`Like a cat or a phantom, this witch wouldn't even let someone pet her if she didn't wish for it.`
`Besides, ...she's telling the truth.`
`{n}For Ange's sake, I can't step down from this fight.`
`{n}Even if these unpleasant witches hijack the game board.`
`"Ehheheheheh.`
` That's just like you, Be~rn.`
` Even the way you frighten people into doing what you want is heartless.`
` ...That's how it is, Battlerr."`
`"You aren't allowed to step down from the game board.`
` You and Beato are both nothing more than pieces on the game board who exist to distract us from our boredom.`
` ...Even your incomprehensible anger and irritation make for a wonderful treat to sate our boredom."`
`"Well, this level of anger only makes for a cheap snack."`
`".........Like those curry‐flavored potato wafers that sell at 30 yen for a pair."`
`""*giggle*giggle*, ahhahahahahahaha...!!""`
`"Y‐you damn......witches......"`
`".........*giggle*.`
` Fight for Ange's sake, okay?`
` And for Beato's too, right...?"`
`In a way that was admonishing, ...or perhaps babying,`
` ......{f:5:Bernkastel} smiled, tormenting Battler in a similar way to how something too sweet sometimes gives you a headache.`
`The host of this tea party, Beato, was absent now,`
` ......and the guest witches were already making themselves at home.`
`"...What'll you do, Ushiromiya Battlerr?`
` Surrender to faaate...?"`
`".................."`
`"Just step down.`
` You've had enough of being toyed with as a witch's piece, right?`
` Eheheheheh, it's tough being one of Bern's pieces.`
` You'll be a throwaway just like Ange.`
` Geheheheheh!"`
`"I'm not giving you the option of stepping down.`
` ......Keep fighting for the sake of your sister's future.`
` I'm on your side.`
` Until you win, I'll support you so that you can reach that future...`
`for all eternity, until I get bored.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*."`
`Battler couldn't allow himself to fall for their provocation and cajolery......`
`These witches knew that he got mad easily, and they were trying to take advantage of that...`
`...Battler withstood it all, ......and finally relaxed his clenched fists.`
`".........If you want to start this fifth game of yours, ...then just do it.`
` Do whatever you want."`
`"Oh, I will.`
` ......Hey, where are you goi~ng?"`
`Even though Battler had acknowledged this fifth game, he turned his back on them,`
` which surprised {f:5:Lambdadelta} a bit.`
`"If you're going to be Beato's substitute,`
` ......then I'm sure that {f:5:Bernkastel} witch over there can be mine if she wants."`
`".........Not a bad idea.`
` Otherwise, this'll turn into a loss by default."`
`"What the heck?!`
` Are you gonna just ignore this Episode 5 that I put so much effort into making?!`
` Rude, ruuude!"`
`"......Battler says he's going to take a break for a while.`
` Until he comes back, I'll be the substitute player.`
` How's that sound...? Battler...?"`
`".........You do that."`
`"............"`
`"......What's wrong, Lambda?`
` If your opponent is me and not that fool Battler, you won't play...?"`
`"Ehheheheheh!!`
` Of course I will{p:0:♪}`
` I'm glad I get to play with you, Be~rn!`
` Come on, let's play, let's play!`
` Let's play together in {f:5:Lambdadelta}‐sama's super <hyper> and <cute> Episode 5~!"`
`".........This is a world that Beato created, remember.`
` You aren't going to ruin the atmosphere of the story, are you...?"`
`"Don't worry about that.`
` I'm really good at reading between the lines for that sort of stuff.`
` I made sure to use a Beato‐ish atmosphere {i:and} I made it into an even {i:more} interesting story."`
`"Battler, make sure you come back as soon as your break's over, okay?`
` It'd be a shame to miss this.`
` I've prepared plenty of bonus hints that'll get you closer to Beato's secre~t{p:0:♪}"`
`"...Is what it'll look like but I'll actually fill it with misdirection and make things more and more confusi~ng.`
` Wait, hey, Battlerr! Why aren't you listening when a witch is talking?!"`
`Without answering, Battler disappeared into the darkness.`
`After shrugging and cackling,`
` the witches immediately started playing with the game board they had stolen from Beato......`
`"Can those witches really understand Beato's game?"`
`"...Since they're using the same game board, they cannot do anything that this child cannot do.`
` However, they can do things that she wouldn't do."`
`"............`
` ...What do you mean, things she wouldn't do?"`
`"The materials of chess exist to play chess with.`
` You {i:cannot} use them to play cards.`
` However, as for throwing the chess pieces at your opponent, or scribbling on the board..."`
`"Doing such things is not impossible.`
` However, that would be blasphemy against the game of chess,`
` so people {i:don't do that}."`
`"....................."`
`That definitely......wouldn't be chess anymore.`
`{n}It looked like Beato's eyes clouded very slightly with sadness.`
`".........Damn them.`
` .........This game is between me and Beato.`
` ...I won't let anyone else profane it."`
`At that time, gold butterflies gathered and Ronove appeared, holding a tea set with black tea.`
`"Would you like some more tea?"`
`".........If you wouldn't mind."`
`"Certainly.`
` ......So,`
` how has this journey of yours in search of Milady's thoughts been?"`
`"I'm as clueless as ever, but I'm enjoying it."`
`"On a different topic, ......are you certain about this?`
` Relaxing here, I mean."`
`"......Are you talking about the game those witches are playing all by themselves?"`
`"Yes.`
` Just now, when I went to serve them some tea, the murders of the first twilight had already taken place,`
` and it seemed as though the next murder would occur shortly."`
`When Beato and I were playing,`
` the game would be paused whenever someone left their seats.`
`......However, those witches wouldn't pause that game just because I wasn't around...`
`"............Ronove, did you see their game?"`
`"Just a part of it."`
`"How was it?"`
`Ronove lifted the pot high with an elegant gesture as he poured the black tea.`
`After he was done, he finally spoke,`
` expressing his thoughts in very few words.`
`"It did not have...love."`
`"......What do you mean, love?"`
`"My apologies.`
` That is how it would be put if a woman were to say it.`
` ......As a man,`
` ......perhaps one could say it was dishonorable."`
`I understood what those words meant.`
`When I met {f:5:Virgilia}'s eyes, she shook her head slightly and stared at the floor...`
`".........At a glance, I believe it resembles Milady's games greatly.`
` However, the foundation is very different."`
`"Does it go against the rules of Beato's game?"`
`"No, it does not.`
` {f:5:Lambdadelta}‐sama understands the rules of Milady's game very well indeed.`
` ......However..."`
`".................."`
`Battler stood up.`
`There was no need to make Ronove say any more.`
`"Battler‐kun......"`
`"......Sorry, Ronove.`
` I know you went to all the trouble of pouring this for me, but tea isn't what I need."`
`"You will go after all?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ......We don't need any outsiders in our game."`
`...Those guys weren't even here in the beginning.`
`Because I've been loafing about, crazier and crazier witches have been introduced,`
` ......and now they've hijacked this game between me and Beato.`
`"I've got to take it back.`
` ......I'm supposed to be the one taking care of Beato's game board now.`
` ...That means I shouldn't just sit around here."`
`"......Thank you.`
` I wanted to let this child hear those words."`
`"I'm sure she hears them.`
` ......Milady is simply unable to answer."`
`Beato lay there silently, like a living doll with dull eyes...`
`The game board that she had created herself had been hijacked by incomprehensible people and was being turned into a mess...`
`Beato had called on me to be her opponent.`
`{n}Then this game must be something she created for me.`
`{n}I've......got to take it back.`
`"......You just wait here.`
` I'm going to take it back."`
`"....................."`
`Of course, Beato didn't respond in any way.`
` ......That's right.`
`{n}If she can't respond, ...then I have to protect it in her place.`
`"I'll be right back.`
` ......{f:5:Virgilia}, Ronove.`
` ...I'm counting on you two to look after this golden sleeping princess."`
`"Yes. Leave it to us."`
`"......See you later, Battler‐kun.`
` And please,`
` ......try to discover some part of this child in their game without her.`
` If you can,`
` ......then it will mean that you have fought with her, even in her absence."`
`".........You're right.`
` ...Yeah,`
` ......this is no goddamn good at all.`
` What am I doing?"`
`Let's go.`
` ...And let's take it back.`
`"Sorry to keep you waiting, witches!!`
` My break is over!!"`
`When he faced the jet‐black heavens and yelled this,`
` the whole world shattered, as though it were made out of thin glass.`
`Then, ......as though it had been that way since the beginning,`
` .........it transformed into that smoking room where Battler had fought Beato so many times, ...and which the two witches had now hijacked.`
`"What do you think you're doing?`
` You're only coming back now?`
` It's way too late!`
` Not only has the game reached the second day, it's already at the finale!"`
`".........You never showed up, so I just advanced things on my own."`
`Yeah, like you ever even waited for me in the first place...`
`"Bern was waaay sharper and more thrilling than you were. Right?!"`
`"Shut up.`
` I'm the player here.`
` You substitute witches can just take a step back now."`
`".........Well, I don't really mind if you join in starting now, but there's probably no need for you anymore."`
`"Seriously.`
` After all, we're already at the climax!`
` After this, Bern will probably corner me and win."`
`"What the hell.........?!"`
`".........Why not, though?`
` Let's let him watch the final moves."`
`"Yeah.`
` Come on over, Ushiromiya Battler.`
` It's almost completely over, but here's the <cute> and <elegant> game I made!"`
`"Episode 5:`
` End of the`
` Golden Witch!"`
`Right now, no humans exist on this island except for those in this parlor.`
`And with one exception, it has been shown that none of them have committed murder.`
`And the culprit is among these people.`
`"......Whoa, whoa.`
` ...In that case, ...it's conclusive, isn't it...?"`
`"Unless the culprit is a witch who committed murder with magic, that is..."`
`"............It was you?!`
` You killed George, killed my husband?!`
` Why?!!`
` Whyy{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}yyy?!!"`
`"I, ...I didn't kill anyone...!`
` I, I, d‐didn't do...!!"`
`"....................."`
`In a panic, and with a voice that really couldn't be called flowing,`
` ......in a manner that was, to put it coldly, unsightly...Aunt Natsuhi denied the suspicion placed upon her...`
`However, ......there was no longer any way around it...`
`{i:The girl} stood up, ...brushed back her long hair, pointed at Aunt Natsuhi, and said it one more time.`
`"......You are the culprit.`
` Ushiromiya Natsuhi‐san."`
