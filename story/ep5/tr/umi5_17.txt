`In the cathedral devoid of people,`
` .........a figure could be seen still staring up at the heavens,`
` its chest pierced with a long red sword which pinned it in place to the ground.`
` ......It was the figure of Battler.`
`......Ironically,`
` it looked just like what he had done to Beato with blue wedges in the fourth game......`
`Battler had died quite some time ago.`
`No, .........in this place, the concept of death means nothing except that one has stopped thinking.`
`Therefore, in a sense, Battler was not dead.`
`......After being defeated in a fight over the truth, he no longer had the strength to think of a way to resist.`
`And so...he was dead.`
`Dlanor's massive longsword, which had been left in place of a tombstone,`
` ......fastened Battler to the spot even after his death...`
`This was being lit by a faint light seeping out of a high, high skylight.`
`Quiet footsteps rang out across this still cathedral......`
`From the darkness behind a pillar, ......a woman slowly stepped forwards.`
`......It was {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`Her eyes had no light in them, ......and looked the same way they had for so long in the Golden Land,`
` still muddied over with gray.`
`Previously, she couldn't even drink black tea properly without assistance,`
` ......but now, though it was slow, ...and though there was no life in her eyes,`
` ......she was, surprisingly, walking.`
`And with slow, deliberate steps,`
` she reached Battler,`
` ......who was still dead and pierced......`
`Then,`
` ......slowly...`
`...she touched him.`
`{n}......She tugged...`
`on his sleeve.`
`However, Battler showed no reaction......`
`......When she realized that it wasn't sleep...`
`...but death,`
` .........the witch with the forlorn gaze...`
`...drooped her head even lower...`
`Then...`
`...she quietly...`
`......whispered...`
`"...............`
` ............You`
`......liar........."`
`Beato...`
`...softly touched Battler.........`
`{n}Then,`
` ......she pressed her forehead against Battler's chest.`
`There was no longer......`
`......any heartbeat.`
`It wasn't just because he had surrendered.`
`{n}It was because the witches had banished him from the game board.`
`......So now...`
`{n}......Battler would never......return...`
`So now...`
`.........the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`...had no more reason...`
`......to exist............`
`{a:c:`
`.........Thank you...{n}`
`......Liar......{n}`
`...Goodbye......{n}`
`And.........{n}`
`...I'm sorry.}`
`Then,`
` ......the Golden Witch,`
` ...her task...`
`...completed,`
` ...scattered...`
`as a spray of gold.`
`In the Golden Land,`
` ......the gray rain...`
`gently continued to fall.`
`......There was a faint aroma of good black tea.`
`Beato stared blankly at the surface of the tea.`
`There was {f:5:Virgilia}, continuing her knitting,`
` .........along with me and......Dlanor, talking to each other.`
`......This is...`
`......a flashback......`
`A flashback to a memory of Battler's, which Dlanor's sword must have given him as it pierced him......`
`A flashback of that time Dlanor had come to visit the tea party in the Golden Land.........`
`"The same goes for {f:5:me}.`
` I will not be caught unawares in our next {f:5:bout}."`
`"Perfect.`
` I'll take you on anytime.`
` Give me everything you've got."`
`"You have my {f:5:word}.`
` Everything I {f:5:have}."`
`......Dlanor.`
`I'd thought she was a ruthless killer doll without a heart,`
` ...but maybe she actually is pretty approachable.`
`......Though of course, neither of us will show any mercy when fighting on the game board.`
`For a while, we gazed at the rain‐drenched rose garden...`
`as we quietly enjoyed our tea.`
`"......Still, it really is terrifying.`
` The way you fight.`
` ......Knox's Ten Commandments, or the Decalogue, wasn't it?`
` Those fallbacks of the mystery genre, right?"`
`"{f:5:Yes}.`
` ......They are commandments conceived by my {f:5:father}."`
`"Hidden doors must not exist.`
` That's Knox's third commandment, right?`
` That means there's no need for detectives to even look for hidden doors.`
` ......Sounds pretty ridiculous."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} talked about this.`
`She said that even searching for hidden doors was a waste of time because they're forbidden by Knox's third commandment.`
`It makes me want to argue back and say it isn't so uncommon for a rich family's mansion to have a hidden door or two built into it.`
`......But apparently, you can get away with that kind of rule in the mystery genre.`
`As an aside, there exist many wonderful mysteries in which hidden doors appear,`
` and where hidden doors are the theme.`
`......Though of course this is limited to novels which have the "premise" that hidden doors exist.`
`Without that "premise", hidden doors mustn't exist.`
`{n}So if that "premise" isn't there, there's no need to search for hidden doors.`
`......I think that's probably the essence of her ridiculous argument.`
`I get the feeling that the detective trying to expose the truth and the illusion trying to mask it with fiction...`
`are getting blended together, leading to a bizarre form of argument similar to a Devil's Proof.`
`Making a locked‐room murder seem to be accomplished by a witch with magic—that's fantasy.`
`Exposing that it was a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}'s crime done with tricks—that's anti‐fantasy.`
`Investigating all possibilities to expose what those tricks are—that's mystery.`
`But claiming that possibilities with no hints supporting them are unworthy of investigation—that's......also mystery?`
`Hidden doors, by definition, are hidden in a way that there can't be any clues.`
`Would claiming that hidden doors therefore necessarily exist even if the detective can't find them...`
`...be anti‐mystery?`
`.........That's enough of that.`
`{n}This argument is too far of a digression from the riddles I'm actually supposed to be solving.`
`My fight is very simple.`
`I'm only fighting to explain that it was possible for a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} to carry out these crimes which were supposedly carried out by a witch.`
`This whole discussion about "mystery" and "anti" doesn't serve any purpose.`
`So I can't bring myself to have any particular interest in the rules known as the Knox Decalogue...`
`"............Do you dislike Knox?"`
`"It doesn't work for me.`
` ......There's something just wrong about making it possible to deny the existence of all hidden doors without investigating.`
` ...It's about as dubious as a Devil's Proof.`
` ......Even though it's supposed to be the exact opposite of fantasy, it somehow feels like it's the same kind of argument."`
`"..........................."`
`"......Ah, I shouldn't have said that.`
` Your dad was the one who made them, after all."`
`"Pay that no {f:5:mind}.`
` ......After all, there are some who say they are nothing more than mindless {f:5:fun}."`
`"The Decalogue feels like something very arrogant to you, right, Battler‐kun...?"`
`"......To be honest, yeah.`
` ......If there was ever a detective who said he didn't need to look for hidden doors because they must not exist,`
` everyone should start looking around on the floor to see if some of his screws had come loose..."`
`"In that case, Battler,`
` ......let us say we did away with the third {f:5:commandment}.`
` In that case, what would happen to locked‐room {f:5:mysteries}...?"`
`......What if Knox's third commandment, "hidden doors are forbidden", didn't exist...?`
`".........You mean if hidden doors became OK to use as the solution to locked‐room mysteries?"`
`"I do not mean hidden doors with hints or {f:5:foreshadowing}.`
` ...I mean hidden doors that even the detective cannot find because, of course, they are {f:5:hidden}."`
`"Battler‐kun, you often fight by using a Devil's Proof to propose an undiscoverable element X.`
` ......That's what this is about."`
`"That'd be horrible.`
` Locked‐room mysteries would just unravel as stories."`
`That was another way of saying......that those kinds of stories would simply no longer work.`
`No one would want to try solving the mystery in the first place if they knew the answer might just be an unforeseeable hidden door.`
`"......If you aren't first given some guarantee that no hidden doors exist,`
` you don't feel like trying to deduce anything.`
` ............I see.`
` Knox's third commandment is needed.`
` ......Without it, locked‐room mysteries wouldn't even be worth anyone's time."`
`"If you don't feel like trying to deduce anything...what does that mean...?"`
`"It means you don't even feel like reading to begin with."`
`"That is {f:5:correct}.`
` ......{y:0:Humans}{n:0:Humans} are weak creatures who cannot even think unless they have assurance that reasoning is {f:5:possible}."`
`"...That reasoning is possible.`
` ......In other words, they need encouragement that they can solve it if they do their best."`
`That......might actually be true.`
`......It's the same with exercising.`
`If you're told to run ten laps around the campus, you can tough it out.`
`But if you're made to run without even knowing how many laps it's going to be,`
` you'll probably get tired out before you make it around three times.`
`The same thing goes for thinking and reasoning.`
`Depending on whether or not a problem is guaranteed to be solvable,`
` the way we humans react to it changes completely......`
`"In detective novels, there's always a scene where the detective announces that he's discovered who the culprit is.`
` ......That's a sign saying "The hints have all been given in the previous parts of the story,`
` so dear readers, please try to reason it out"."`
`".........Huh.`
` I always thought it was just a classic line... Never knew it had that meaning."`
`"To put it harshly,`
` as long as the detective doesn't say that,`
` ......even the most avid mystery lover who prides himself on his deductions won't feel like trying to solve it."`
`"......In the previous games, you were like that yourself, were you {f:5:not}......?"`
`"...................................."`
`Come to mention it,`
` ......maybe that really was the case.`
`My fight against Beato began in earnest starting with the second game, I think.`
`When Beato threw locked‐room mysteries at me, at first,`
` I didn't seriously try to tackle them.`
`After all, I knew nothing except that people had died in a locked room, and the windows and doors were all locked from the inside.`
`......I had basically no hints.`
`So I refused to debate, on the grounds that I couldn't fight because the lack of clues made reasoning impossible.`
`......After that, Beato sneered at me, didn't she...`
`asking whether I would repeat that over and over forever in an endless repetition of moves......`
`At that time, Beato said this:`
`— The reason you incompetent fools always stop thinking and then moan about it is "lack of information"!`
` If you are then given information, you start doubting whether the information is true or not by "denying the basis"!`
` Aren't those convenient?`
` What clever little words to hide your own incompetence.`
`Then, she said she'd give me reliable information that couldn't be denied,`
` and created the rule called the red truth.`
`Only after Beato had done all that for me did the curtain finally rise on my battle with her......`
`"......So, ......once I finally had the guarantee that I could solve this tale if I tried,`
` ......that's when I stepped into the ring with her for the first time......?"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......She is a strange {f:5:person}.`
` Mysteries are the only spaces where witches can live, and yet she herself began to give you the red truth, a method by which those mysteries could be {f:5:solved}."`
`You could say that the red truth is a hint Beato gives me so that I'll agree to compete in this war of reasoning.`
`......It's a carrot.`
`Being given a hint is like she's saying,`
` “Go on.`
` Try solving it.`
` It is possible.”`
`......An enigma which is guaranteed to be solvable...`
`...can't be called a true "enigma".`
`"Isn't this almost as though...`
`......Beato herself...`
`is admitting that she...`
`...isn't really a witch...?"`
`"Well now.`
` That does seem logical.`
` ......She truly is a strange child."`
`"................................."`
`Beato gave no answer.`
`With gray eyes, ......she did nothing but blankly gaze at the steam rising from her black tea...`
`"My father created the Decalogue to act as a crutch for the power of {f:5:thinking}.`
` ......It most certainly was not created to arrogantly insist on the way things must {f:5:be}."`
`"......A crutch...for the power of thinking......"`
`"{f:5:Yes}.`
` Knox's 8th: It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not {f:5:presented}.`
` ......This does not only mean that one must avoid making baseless guesses that are not supported by {f:5:clues}."`
`"If you turn it around,`
` .........it means that the one posing the mystery must present clues which lead to the solution."`
`"......So, in other words,`
` ......if a story follows the Decalogue,`
` ......all riddles must have hints,`
` ......and therefore, it's guaranteed that finding the solution is possible."`
`I see......so this is what she means by a crutch for the power of thinking.`
`If you can believe that it's solvable, you start feeling the desire to have a go at those riddles.`
`If you're capable of believing that hints do exist, you get fired up about rereading the story to search for them......`
`"I'll admit......it might have the power of giving courage to people trying to solve it."`
`"The Knox Decalogue is often thought of as a series of restrictions imposed by the one who made the mystery,`
` but it is also vital for the {f:5:readers}.`
` .........By using the Decalogue as a crutch,`
` we are given the courage needed to use reasoning, as well as the willpower to reread the tale several times...`
`in search of the clues we know must be hidden {f:5:there}."`
`".........It's like the lid of a jar of jam which is too tight and won't open.`
` ......Like Mom always used to say,`
` ......if you think you can't open it, then it really won't open no matter how hard you try.`
` ......The same thing happens in sports.`
` They say that whether or not you have a strong image of yourself and believe you can win no matter what...`
`has a large impact on the records you set."`
`In that case,`
` the Knox Decalogue isn't really a set of arrogant and strict restrictions.`
` ......You can also see it as a way to encourage readers, who are trying to solve the mystery, by telling them to give it their all since it's definitely solvable...`
`".........That's an interesting way to interpret it.`
` ......But I've heard that not every detective novel in the world necessarily follows the Decalogue.`
` .........If you ran into one of those, wouldn't you feel betrayed...?"`
`"Even the Decalogue is nothing more than a single interpretation, and it does not apply to all mystery {f:5:stories}.`
` ......Though among fundamentalists of my father's work,`
` it seems there are those who harshly criticize works which violate the Decalogue and call them {f:5:heresy}..."`
`There's no end of arguments like this in the mystery world.`
`Is this or that famous detective novel a "fair" mystery—in other words, one that follows Knox's Ten Commandments?`
`That sort of argument is already an eternal theme of the mystery world.`
`In fact, in mystery discussions,`
` arguments like these sometimes become more heated than talk about the actual solutions......`
`"I can understand the criticism.`
` ......You try your best to solve a mystery, trusting that it follows the Decalogue and can be solved,`
` but then it turns out that it was never made to be solvable in the first place...I can understand how irritating that must be."`
`That's right.`
`When fighting with the Decalogue, ......there's just one thing you want guaranteed from the beginning.`
`And that is.........the guarantee that the detective novel will adhere to the Decalogue.`
`If a work labels itself as an orthodox mystery, then you have nothing to worry about.`
`However, the mystery genre contains many unorthodox sub‐genres within it.`
`.........Does that mean that trying to use reasoning in an unorthodox detective novel...`
`is a complete waste of time......?`
`"......Looking at it that way,`
` ......it really does feel arrogant."`
`"{f:5:Yes}.`
` I also find it extremely sad that my father's Decalogue has been used as such an elitist {f:5:weapon}."`
`"............So...you just fought Beato using the Decalogue as a weapon.`
` ......Can I take that as proof that this game world of Beato's follows the Knox Decalogue......?"`
`"......................................."`
`When I asked that, ......there was a strange silence.`
`{f:5:Virgilia}, Dlanor,`
` ......and of course, Beato...`
`...all remained silent for a while......`
`Almost as though my question had touched at the core of something...`
`"That......is something I cannot answer myself."`
`"Why...?"`
`"This is a game that this child made.`
` ......A game to determine a winner between you and her.`
` ......She called it a confrontation between mystery and fantasy."`
`"But unfortunately, she has never called it an orthodox mystery.`
` That means you have no guarantee that it follows the Decalogue."`
`"......But at the same time, Miss {f:5:Beatrice} has said that this game is a contest between you and {f:5:her}.`
` ......That means there is room for you to achieve {f:5:victory}."`
`"In other words,`
` ...............you're trying to say that it's possible to deduce the solution?"`
`"......................................."`
`".........If you asked her that question, she would probably say that it is.`
` ......However, just as she is the challenger and you are the challenged, the two of you are different creatures.`
` ......Something Beato might have proposed thinking it is solvable...`
`may or may not be something that is solvable for you as well."`
`For example, let's say we pose a simple riddle that any Japanese person would be familiar with.`
`......However, if the person we're telling this riddle to is a foreigner with a Japanese‐English dictionary in their hand,`
` it might be almost impossible to solve.`
`......In other words, it's possible to have a one‐sided "solvable problem",`
` which might be easy for the questioner but extremely difficult for the person trying to solve it...`
`By the way, do you know of the foreign riddle:`
` "Why do dragons sleep all day?"`
`The answer is:`
` "Because they fight knights".`
`It's a riddle from the English realm, so it might be a little tough for a Japanese person.`
`"For that reason,`
` .........I cannot promise that this tale is something you will definitely be able to solve.`
` .........However, I can promise you one thing.`
` ...I will guarantee it with the red truth."`
`".........What?"`
`"{p:1:Beato wanted you to solve it,`
` so she created this game—`
`and the riddles of this tale—to be solvable}.`
` That alone, I will guarantee with the red truth."`
`It was...`
`...the one guarantee...`
`......that all those who try to use reasoning desire.`
`"I do not know whether the answer can be derived by following the Decalogue my father {f:5:created}.`
` ......However, if you run into a tight spot and want a compass for your reasoning,`
` please try using my Decalogue if you {f:5:remember}.`
` ......It might give you renewed courage and possibly even some new {f:5:discovery}......"`
`"Thank you.`
` If I'm truly stuck, I'll think about your fighting style.`
` ......Are you sure it's alright to help out an enemy like this?"`
`"Pay that no {f:5:mind}.`
` I came to this tea party without a {f:5:gift}.`
` I hope you enjoy this in place of a {f:5:snack}.`
` ......And...if you come face to face with me {f:5:again},`
` there will probably be no time to speak of something so {f:5:casually}."`
`.........Knox's Decalogue...`
`...and {f:5:Virgilia}'s red truth.`
`"{p:1:Beato wanted me to solve the riddles of this game,`
` so she created them to be solvable}."`
`In other words, ......Beato thinks I can solve it.`
`Isn't that......proof that it's possible to apply logic to this......?`
`......Of course, that's from Beato's point of view,`
` ......and it doesn't necessarily mean that it'll be possible for me to work it out......`
`But compared to before now, when I didn't even know whether applying reasoning was possible or impossible,`
` ......that one sentence might give me a great deal of courage and strength...`
`At least it has the power to silence any negative thoughts about it just being useless anyway...`
`"......Unless the other party assures you that it's possible to deduce the answer, you won't try.`
` ......It's almost like love between shy, young people."`
`"Love?"`
`"Yes.`
` .........Unless the other person first proves that they love you, you don't want to love them.`
` ......Right?"`
`Both boys and girls......want to hear someone say "I love you" to them first without being prompted.`
`That's the dream.`
`......They don't want to love another person...`
`until they're sure that person will love them back.`
`After all, there's nothing as painful as a one‐sided love,`
` ......and the emotional scars of a love that doesn't work out last a long time.`
`Because they're afraid of that pain,`
` ......more than anything else, they want assurance that the other person will love them back...`
`"I {f:5:see}.`
` That is an interesting way to explain the relationship between writer and reader in a detective {f:5:novel}."`
`Yes,`
` ......maybe you could liken detective novels to that.`
`Both the writer and the reader...`
`...first want the other party to tell them "I will solve it", or "It can be solved".`
`Until the writer is assured that readers will definitely attempt to solve their story, they don't want to write it.`
`The same goes for the readers.`
`Until they are assured that they will definitely be able to solve the story if they try, they don't want to read it.`
`Because they don't want to write what they consider a masterpiece and be hurt when no one reads it.`
`Because they don't want to apply logic to what they consider a masterpiece and be hurt when they realize it was all useless.`
`"By that argument...`
`......it really isn't a stretch to say it's like love between shy elementary or middle school‐aged kids.`
` ......Even though they are interested, they don't have the courage to reveal their feelings,`
` so they wait uncomfortably for the other person to confess......and by the time summer ends, nothing's happened."`
`"Heheh, sometimes they'll even hook up with a different person.`
` That's what my first love was like, ihihi."`
`Along with these one‐sided feelings they can't express, they lament the passage of a summer which will never come again, and the days of their youth end.`
`The writer who wouldn't write until he gained the support of readers...goes for all eternity without releasing his maiden work.`
`The reader who waited for the writer's rise to fame...goes their whole life without knowing the joy of the mystery genre.`
`"......Battler‐kun.`
` When does this "the chicken or the egg" type of shy love...`
`reach the level where it progresses into mutual love......?"`
`"Well, .........it's probably gradual over time.`
` ...It starts as a relationship between friends, they communicate with each other more,`
` ......and they start thinking "I like this person and I think they like me"...`
`...and when both of them reach the stage where they're no longer in doubt, then...`
`......well, I guess...they probably just naturally become a couple."`
`"The impression I've gotten so far is that relationships which start with a sudden confession of love tend to break up more often,`
` whereas couples who never actually confess to each other but realize that they've always been together usually stay together for a surprisingly long time."`
`"In other words,`
` it happens when a relationship of trust forms where each person trusts the other,`
` ......is what you are {f:5:saying}."`
`".........Yeah, maybe.`
` ......I'm surprised.`
` ...I always thought mysteries were a battle between the writer and the reader, ......but maybe they actually aren't."`
`"Yes.`
` They can only exist if there is mutual trust,`
` ......a relationship with love."`
`"................................."`
`"................................."`
`"......Then...you're saying that me and her...`
`...aren't in a battle to the death but a loving relationship?"`
`"......*giggle*.`
` Though it doesn't look like anything more than a pair of elementary schoolers bullying each other to me...`
` Heheheheh."`
`{f:5:Virgilia} joked at us in a middle‐aged‐woman sort of way.`
`Still, ......though I'm not expecting friendship or a trusting relationship,`
` ......I can accept her as a rival.`
`Beato is fighting at full force, trying to make me acknowledge that she's a witch.`
`And I'm responding to that and going all out trying to deny that witches exist.`
`"You say that Miss Beato is fighting at full {f:5:force}.`
` How can you be so sure of {f:5:that}?"`
`"I mean, you can tell by looking, can't you?"`
`"It is not as though she has proclaimed in red that she was fighting you at full {f:5:force}.`
` ......And yet, you have no {f:5:doubt}?`
` You are the one who said you would not believe anything except the red {f:5:truth}."`
`".........ngh.................."`
`"*giggle*.`
` ......This must be the stage where communication increases and you learn not to doubt your relationship,`
` as you mentioned earlier."`
`{f:5:Virgilia} and Dlanor giggled together.`
`......One guy, multiple women.`
` The topic is love.`
`......Wait a sec, isn't this the worst formation for getting made fun of?`
`I tried a couple of times to change the subject...`
`and clumsily brought up more refined topics in an attempt to return the mood to something more suitable for a tea party in the rainy Golden Land,`
` but each time, {f:5:Virgilia} saw right through me and laughed at me......`
`..............................`
`Even amidst this, Beato kept looking downwards with those gray eyes,`
` staring into her black tea.........`
`........................`
`.........Yeah, that's right......`
`{f:5:Virgilia} and Dlanor.........gave me so many hints back then...`
`And yet, I barely thought about them at all...`
`It's way too late now, but......`
`.........{i:Let me think}.`
`Now that it's too late to change anything and I have an endless amount of time on my hands, .........let me think.`
`......One more time, let me think about the red truth {f:5:Virgilia} gave me...`
`and the crutch called the Decalogue that Dlanor lent me......`
`With the red truth,`
` .........{f:5:Virgilia} guaranteed that at the very least, Beato left enough room in this tale for me to achieve victory.`
`......That red truth guarantee...`
`...will give me the power to start my heart beating once again...`
`And......there's the crutch of the Decalogue, which Dlanor lent me.`
`Even she began by warning me that the Decalogue isn't so almighty that it can solve all riddles.`
`But even so, she kind of described it as a method to solve...`
`...no, to take on riddles.`
`......Let me try it.`
`Even though there's no guarantee whether this tale is mystery or fantasy,`
` ......let me believe that I'll definitely be able to solve it,`
` ......that it is a solvable tale,`
` ......a mystery,`
` ......and let me make one last attempt......`
`When I came to,`
` ......I was suddenly...`
`...in that strange tea room,`
` ......where I had often argued furiously with Beato across a table.`
`......Of course, Beato was nowhere to be found.`
`{n}It was just me......isolated and alone.`
`That's alright.`
` Even so, ......I won't stop thinking.`
`Okay then.`
`.........What were Knox's Commandments again......?`
`I'm sure Dlanor explained most of them when slamming me with them.`
`Of course, even I recall them vaguely.`
`What was......the first one, again......?`
`"......I beg to inform you of the following.`
` Knox's 1st:`
` It is forbidden for the culprit to be anyone not mentioned in the early part of the story."`
`When I muttered about what the first one was...`
`.........Dlanor's subordinate appeared,`
` ......as if in answer to my question.`
`Without bothering with an unnecessary "hello", she told me nothing more or less than what I wanted to know.`
`"......Yeah, that's it.`
` The first commandment.`
` ......The culprit has to be one of the people mentioned in the early part of the story."`
`.........Does that mean that by the end of the first game,`
` ......the culprit must have appeared already......?`
`True, that is the most basic of basics in the mystery genre.`
` A given.`
`......A given...?`
`......Have I really...`
`......kept that as a basic assumption......?`
`With each new game, the number of people in this tale keeps increasing.`
`That violates the closed circle rule.`
`From that moment onwards, everything is screwed up.`
`Did I give up on the inside,`
` ......thinking that the true culprit or mastermind must not have shown up yet and that reasoning was therefore useless......?`
`If I read this tale as a fantasy,`
` ......new characters keep showing up to the point where even having demon kings or gods or divine creators appear wouldn't be strange at all.`
`Even if the true mastermind first appeared in one of the last Episodes, I'd just accept it as that kind of story.`
`However, ......if I read it as a mystery and stick with that conviction...`
`...then there's no need to worry at all about anyone who shows up later.`
`Because Knox's 1st clearly rules them out,`
` stating that it's impossible for the culprit to be anyone who appears later on in the story.`
`............Of course, there's also what both Dlanor and {f:5:Virgilia} said.`
`There's no guarantee that this tale follows the rules of the Decalogue,`
` so of course, I can't deny the possibility that the culprit first appeared in the second game or later.`
`However, ......this is one way of thinking.`
`This time...`
`...I'll forget about the Devil's Proof completely......and try to borrow the power of the Decalogue in my thinking.`
`After all, I know by now that I'll never be able to reach the truth without looking from multiple perspectives.`
`"In that case, .........that means the culprit in all of these repeating games...`
`is one of the 18 people.`
` From the very beginning......there was no need for an illusion of a 19th person."`
`......Even the first of Knox's commandments...`
`...denies the existence of an unknown person known as the witch from the very start.`
`If I had followed that in the truest sense...`
`...I might not have suffered so miserably in the second game.`
`"......Knox's 2nd?"`
`"I beg to inform you of the following.`
` Knox's 2nd:`
` It is forbidden for supernatural agencies to be employed as a detective technique."`
`Dlanor's other subordinate appeared without a sound...and gave me an answer to my question.`
`......That's right.`
` A detective can't go around using magic.`
`"So, ............`
`......if this is a fair battle,`
` ......does that mean that, like the detective,`
` ......the culprit also isn't allowed to use magic......?"`
`"I beg to inform you of the following.`
` ......Know that the interpretation is up to you."`
`"Figures.`
` ......Right.`
` Then I'll interpret it my way."`
`If this game is a fair battle between me and Beato...`
`......then because this tale is solvable,`
` it features no elements which are impossible to explain with logic.`
`In other words, magic cannot—must not—exist.`
`When it does appear, I shouldn't suspect that the mystery element is breaking down,`
` ......but I should instead question why it was shown and suspect the witnesses and observers.`
`That's right,`
` ......that was...`
`...Beato's greatest weapon in the second game.`
`Depictions of magic that have no place in a mystery.`
`By showing me that, she forced me to think that this tale wasn't a mystery,`
` and therefore, that reasoning was impossible, ...and I surrendered......`
`However, if I had believed unshakably that it was a mystery...`
`......it would have been completely obvious to doubt the witnesses who claimed to have seen those things.`
`Also, at the end of the first game,`
` it was revealed that this tale had been passed on to people in the future by means of a message bottle.`
`......Someone wrote down the incident...in the form of a story.`
`In other words, ......this entire story is a world which includes the personal opinions of an observer,`
` namely, the person who wrote that message in a bottle.`
`In other words, the observer isn't God.`
` It's a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
`Therefore, there's no guarantee that the descriptions are truly impartial.`
`By the end of the first game,`
` it had already been made clear that the text violated a constant premise of mystery stories:`
` that they must be told from a God's‐eye view.`
`For that reason, it's possible to doubt not just the witnesses, but the observer as well.`
`If I could've doubted this much,`
` ......then no matter how many seemingly unsolvable displays of magic appeared,`
` I wouldn't have had to blindly accept them and give up......`
`However, that raises the question:`
` .........is it even possible to solve a story written by an observer who isn't impartial?`
`.........All reasoning ends here if you get obsessed with this.`
`That's why......it's so important for me to believe.`
`That Beato...`
`......is trying to fight me through this tale.`
`Because it's a fight,`
` ......that means I've been given a chance of winning.`
`And the fact that I've been given that...`
`......must mean...`
`......that reasoning is possible.`
`......This part......is the hardest.`
`Unless I believe that the cruel witch took on the risk of losing to try and have a fair fight with me,`
` ......I can't get past this part.`
`......{f:5:Virgilia}'s right, ......it's just like love.`
`If I can't believe that Beato is fighting me head‐on with everything she's got,`
` ......I won't be able to reason any further than this.`
`.........Alright, ...I'll admit it.`
`Unless I admit that we're "in love",`
` ......I won't be able to get any further.`
`When {f:5:Virgilia} ran out of patience with the two of us, shy and incapable as we were of admitting that out loud,`
` she gave me that red truth instead.`
`That was the red truth saying`
` “{p:1:Beato wanted me to solve the riddles of this game, so she created them to be solvable}”.`
`......What the hell is that?`
`It's like "Satou‐san in class A says he likes you~".`
`{n}Like hearing a love confession via a friend...`
`.........I really am...`
`......pitiful.`
`Reasoning......is love.`
`If we don't love each other,`
` ......the logic won't open up.`
`In that case, why can't we just say that we love each other?`
`"If you think you can solve it, just you try."{n}"You're incompetent, like hell you can solve it."`
`......Yeah, according to George‐aniki, you call that sort of thing "tsundora".`
`Heheh, that brutal witch is finally starting to look a bit cute.`
`......If I meet her again, I wanna try saying "You're such a tsundora".`
`If I meet her again, ............somewhere...`
`.......................................`
`"......Tell me the other parts of the Decalogue.`
` I don't care about the order.`
` ......Give me something that seems useful."`
`"I beg to inform you of the following.`
` Knox's 8th:`
` It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not presented."`
`"I beg to inform you of the following.`
` Knox's 6th:`
` It is forbidden for accident or unaccountable intuition to be employed as a detective technique."`
`It must not be solved with clues that aren't presented.`
`{n}And it must not be solved by luck.`
`If this tale is made to be solvable...`
`then we can read this the opposite way.`
`In other words,`
` ......clues must have been prepared so that the tale can be solved.`
`And it has to have been made in a way that it can be solved without relying on luck.`
`If I can believe strongly that Beato is challenging me to a fair game where reasoning is possible...`
`......I can be sure of that.`
`That must mean......that Beato has already concealed...`
`clues, hints, and messages within the tale so far.`
`......It isn't from the Decalogue, but Erika or someone said this:`
`{n}There are three riddles to be exposed in a mystery.`
`One is the whodunit.`
` Who is the culprit?`
`{n}One is the howdunit.`
` How did they commit the crime?`
`{n}One is the whydunit.`
` Why did they commit the crime?`
`All of this means that clues related to these three riddles are already present inside this tale.`
`......No, strictly speaking, it's like this:`
`......Beato scattered hints about because she wanted me to solve those three riddles.`
`Though whether I'm capable of catching those hints or not is another matter...`
`Even if you pose a riddle thinking it's easy...it might be difficult for the person trying to solve it.`
`Therefore, it's only natural for there to be a difference in how difficult each person thinks it is.`
`.........That's why...`
`...as Beato went through each successive game, she watched me closely and tweaked the game as needed to get a good arrangement.`
`When Beato realized that I'd completely surrendered in the second game because it was too hard,`
` she secretly worried.`
`If I surrendered and lost the will to fight, ......the game would no longer remain on an even footing.`
`Therefore, in order to make me regain my will to fight,`
` ......from the third game onwards, she set things up in a way that made it easier for me,`
` giving me tips on how to fight and a few hints.`
`The appearance of {f:5:Virgilia} and Ronove was obviously so that they could help me.`
`Also, though we still had the usual crazy magic shows,`
` she gave me the metaphor of the Braun tube trial, as well as tips on how to fight back.`
`I finally understood how to fight,`
` .........and at the end of the fourth game...`
`......Beato managed to have the all‐out showdown with me that she had probably wanted most of all.`
`......Then, Beato acknowledged that my abilities had become full‐fledged,`
` .........and entrusted me with her heart,`
` ...............entrusted me with explaining this tale, didn't she...`
`In that case, ......it was really dumb of me to boycott most of the fifth game,`
` just because I was so disgusted with those two witches...`
`It doesn't matter who the Game Master is.`
`All I need is to search for the truth in Beato's game.`
`......On the contrary, I should probably thank those two witches just a little,`
` for continuing the game in Beato's place now that she's gone and left everything to me.`
`Of course,`
` I doubt those evil witches were trying to do anything of the sort......`
`Culprit.`
` Crime.`
` Motive.`
`The answers, the hints, to those three ultimate riddles.........must be scattered throughout the tale shown so far.`
`It's probably a very faint light, ......like trying to find beads that have fallen onto a sandy beach.`
`They're definitely there.`
`......However, they're so faint that unless I believe strongly, there's no way I'll be able to find them.`
`"For your attention:`
` I beg to state the following."`
`".........What is it......?"`
`"Go back......through the tale.`
` ......Know that you have now been given eyes that will not miss the truth's faint light."`
`"............Now is the time...`
`............to go back......"`
`"Be advised that for reasoning to be possible, a trusting relationship is required."`
`"......Yeah,`
` ......I know.`
` .........In fact,`
` ...I might have just realized at last."`
`It's something that has been repeated over and over again throughout the tale...`
`...persistently so.`
`"......Without love,`
` ......the truth...cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}......"`
`Slowly, the tea room dissolved into darkness......`
`Then, as though I was slowly sinking into a pitch black sea,`
` .........I passed through the cracks of the long journey I'd taken with Beato...`
`......and kept on falling and falling......`
`It was a bizarre experience......`
`like crossing over the boundary of sleep while still conscious.`
`The several tales that had come before became faint bubbles—no, perhaps small shining fragments—`
`that were scattered like stars in a pitch black sky.`
`I kept sinking on and on...`
`...into that sea......`
`The tales up until now...`
`......one after another...`
`......after another.........`
`Vergilius guided Dante to Mount Purgatory,`
` ......and led him to Beatrice, the eternal lady who waited at the top.`
`Therefore,`
` .........the innermost depths lay not at the bottom,`
` .........but at the peak of Mount Purgatory.`
`The eternal lady...`
`...had been waiting there for Dante...`
`...the whole time......`
`{a:c:And then.........I knew.}`
`......I finally...reached the truth.........`
`.........In the depths, ...no,`
` .........at the peak...of Mount Purgatory...............`
`............Idiot............`
`......You...`
`......really are...`
`...an idiot......`
`"...Ah,`
` ......gwah...`
`.........that hurts........."`
`He woke from the sleep of death,`
` ......and bit by bit......his sense of pain came back to him......`
`As Battler hung there pierced by the longsword, his head still tilted towards the heavens,`
` ......life gradually returned to his face...through an expression of suffering......`
`"You...`
`......really are...`
`...an idiot......`
` ......A huge idiot........."`
`Battler...noticed.`
`......The whole time,`
` .........Beato had been snuggling up against him......sleeping.`
`And when he held her,`
` .........he found...`
`......that it was not Beato...`
`......but her crumbling...`
`...remains.`
`And because her form was as fragile as ash,`
` when Battler tried to hold it,`
` .........just like a sandcastle made on a beach...`
`...being washed away by a small wave,`
` ......it fell apart and lost its form......`
`At Battler's feet......lay nothing but the ragged remnants of Beato's dress......and a pile of ash.`
`No, ......on top of that pile of ash......he could see something sparkling gold.`
`......It was...`
`.........the husk...`
`...of a single gold butterfly...`
`...which had been torn to bits......`
`And so, .........Battler...`
`knew......`
`{n}I......did reach the truth...`
`......But......I wasn't able to do it...`
`......while Beato...`
`......still remained in this world............`
`"......Beato......`
`......you...`
`......really are...`
`......an idiot......"`
`I finally reached the truth...`
`...of this ridiculous riddle...`
`...you created......`
`......Just...`
`...like you wanted......!`
`I didn't lose heart...`
`...and I finally...`
`...made it all the way to the end.........`
`So why...`
`......did you lose heart...`
`.........without waiting for me......?`
`......You believed so strongly, didn't you......?`
` That I'd......definitely reach the truth......`
`So, .........why.........?`
`Why...`
`............couldn't you believe with me...`
`.........and wait............?`
`It wasn't you who was forcing an endless torture on someone.`
`It was me...!`
` I've been the one putting you through a cruel torture...!`
`You resisted until the very end and kept on appealing to me......`
` ........And now...`
`...even though I finally...`
`......reached the truth...`
`You...`
`......couldn't wait any longer...`
`......and it's all too late.........`
`"Y‐.........`
`...............you idiooooot.........`
` ......Why......did you give in...`
`......before meeeeeee..."`
`It's my......fault......`
` I forced her to endure this torture.`
`{n}In fact, I'm amazed she endured for so long......`
`She kept on appealing to me, over and over and over again,`
` .........and because I was so incompetent......I couldn't even begin to understand the truth.`
`"Idiot......`
`......idiot.........`
` ......Your riddles...`
`...were too damn twisted......!!`
` ......Why couldn't...`
`...you say it...`
`.........more simply......?`
` ...You foo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ool!!`
` Aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}agg{0}gh{0}h{0}hhh!!"`
`His scream of pain...`
`...filled...`
`......this cathedral of sorrow...`
`The sad witch who wasn't able to let Battler know of the truth.`
`{n}The sad man who wasn't able to understand the witch's truth.`
`Battler howled in anger and sadness for both of them......`
`The clock hung in the cathedral showed that it was midnight on October 5th, 1986.`
`Time was up...`
`......for everything.........`
`If you're going to create a riddle as hard as this and be so proud of it,`
` ...don't go and set a goddamned time limit on it......`
`".........No,`
` ......I understand......`
` Even though there was such a faint chance of that miracle happening,`
` .........you prayed for it to happen......`
` ......You're...`
`......just like Grandfather."`
`You prayed for and bet on the power of a miracle...`
`......one so unlikely that it was totally impossible, less likely than finding a bead you've dropped on a sandy beach.........`
`And because you did...I {i:have} now arrived at that miracle.`
`But......your time...`
`...didn't last long enough............`
`If I had reached this point even a little sooner...`
`If I could have {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen} the truth......!!`
`Even if it had been right before time was up,`
` .........I might...`
`......have been able to save you...!!`
`But now, ......I've been run through pathetically,`
` ......and I can't......even hold what remains of you......!`
`......I struggled, attempting to pull the longsword out,`
` ......or at least touch her remains by stretching out my arms......but neither worked.`
`"......Shiiiiiit......`
`dammiiiiiiiiiittt.........!!!"`
`.........At that time, I noticed a golden glint on the palm of my hand.`
`It was............a single wing from a gold butterfly.`
`That small fragment of gold...`
`......was the only piece of Beato...`
`...that I was permitted to touch.........`
`I cried with all my strength, .........gripped that fragment...and pressed it against my head, apologizing.`
`......Why couldn't I reach the truth earlier......?`
`Then I pressed it to my chest,`
` ............promising that even though things had come to this,`
` ......I would never again...`
`...lose...`
`...the truth......`
`When I pressed my hand against my chest, ......the sword piercing my chest cut my wrist, and blood dribbled out.`
`That blood spread throughout my fist...`
`......and it must have...`
`...soaked that gold fragment with my red blood.`
`It must have been......the only way of telling her...`
`...that I'd found the truth she had wanted to tell me......`
`I clutched the wing of the gold butterfly...`
`...with my freshly bleeding hand...`
`......and pressed it against the red sword that impaled me......`
`In this moment,`
` ......Ushiromiya Battler...knew.`
` And understood.`
`......He had arrived...`
`......at the entirety...`
`...of this tale......`
`At that moment, ......it seemed as though a faint golden light...`
`...leaked out of the gaps in his clenched fist.`
`The two witches had their backs turned,`
` and Erika was laughing at Battler's corpse.`
`"......What a disgrace you are, Battler‐san.`
` Your foolishness will be immortalized in this statue......`
` ..................Huh......?"`
`Just then, Battler's chest...`
`...no,`
` .........the red longsword impaling Battler...`
`......began to shine gold from deep within his chest......`
`That bright golden light.........began to change the red sword's color...`
`...turning it gold......`
`"............What's going on......?"`
`"B‐......Battler is......`
` ......What...`
`......is this......?!"`
`"..................!"`
`"Gwah...!!"`
`Battler coughed up blood and groaned.`
`His consciousness...came back.`
` His will to live, his will to fight...came back...`
`The red longsword impaling Battler......could no longer be described as such.`
`...By now, it had become a golden longsword.`
`Then...`
`......slowly...`
`...slowly...`
`......it pulled itself out of Battler's chest......`
`After it had finally pulled itself out of Battler completely, it flipped through the air...`
`...and stuck upright into the ground in front of Battler's eyes, as though it knew who its master was.`
`Battler, crawling on the floor and moaning, grabbed the golden longsword...`
`...and though it looked painful,`
` ......he slowly...`
`......rose to his feet once again.`
`"......This sure is an elaborate act.`
` ...Is this one of your tricks, Lambda?"`
`"Th‐`
`.........that glow...`
` ............I‐it can't be........."`
`Lambda stared wide‐eyed at that bright golden glow in awe...`
`Noticing that Battler's resurrection wasn't part of a script Lambda had thought up,`
` Bern also frowned slightly...`
`"......Sorry. Retrials will not be permitted.`
` Chiester Sisters, eliminate this resurrection illusion..."`
`"Understood, ma'am.`
` 45, 410, firing permission granted."`
`"I‐......it's......unable to target!!`
` IFF error, code 999...!"`
`".........Whoa."`
`"...Three Nines...?! Impossible...!"`
`The Chiester Sisters hesitated, unable to carry out {f:5:Bernkastel}'s orders...`
`"Lambda, what kind of farce is this?`
` ......The witch illusions have been completely destroyed, and the trial ended with our victory."`
`".........Sorry, Bern.`
` ......You'll have to stick around a bit longer.`
` .........Isn't that right, Ushiromiya Battler......?"`
`"...............Yeah.`
` ......Sorry to keep you waiting, Erika,`
` ......{f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` ......Now it's time for my truth......"`
`"I accept your request for a retrial.`
` ......The coven retracts the adjournment of the Court of Illusions!!"`
`"O‐objection.`
` The trial has already been concluded and the verdict has been announced...!"`
`"Objection overruled...!!`
` All verdicts are overshadowed by new truths!!"`
`"Objection!!`
` Not only has Battler been banished as a player, he also doesn't hold the rank of witch...!`
` He has no right to appeal...!"`
`"Objection overruled!!`
` The thing is...he does now. Have that.`
` ......I acknowledge it by the name of the Witch of Certainty, {f:5:Lambdadelta}...`
` ......Ushiromiya Battler...!`
` I acknowledge you as the new Golden Witch,`
` ......no, .........as the new Endless Sorcerer, Ushiromiya Battler...!!!"`
`"......Wh‐`
`...what did you say......?`
` ......B‐`
`......Battler got...`
`......the rank of a witch......?!"`
`The rank of a witch, which she had desired for so long, had been granted to Battler so quickly.`
`And on top of that, this wasn't anything temporary.`
`{n}......This was an official, proper authorization by {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
`Erika couldn't accept it, and her face turned bright red...`
`".........Hmph, ......heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haaah!!`
` Looks like that kid's game really will keep us entertained until the very end...!`
` Sure, I'll play along...!"`
`"{f:5:Erika}, accept his challenge...!`
` The red truth you've created with me is perfect...!`
` The construction of truth which makes Natsuhi the culprit is perfect...!`
` Battler will never be able to break it!"`
`"O‐of course, my master...!!`
` There's no need to worry at all!`
` Anyway, Chiester Sisters, my master ordered you to fire!`
` How long is it going to take you to carry that order out?!"`
`"E‐error code 999!`
` A‐an access code is required to target the territory lord...!"`
`".........Nyeh.`
` I told you he'd do it nyeh."`
`"Territory lord...?! Who is?!`
` Who controls this fragment?!`
` I do...!!"`
`".........Territory lord......`
` ......You don't mean.........`
`......Battler is.........?"`
`"Yes.`
` Ushiromiya Battler has been authorized as the official territory lord of this fragment, ma'am...!"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` ......You still don't understand?`
` You don't know what that golden glow signifies?`
` .........Battler......has reached it.`
` ......He's made his way to the innermost depths of all truths!!"`
`".........................................."`
`"That means Battler's understood everything about this world, this tale, this game.`
` ......In other words, he's reached the position of the game's ruler.`
` ......*giggle*, I'll bet you don't want to believe it, right, Bern?!"`
`"......Heh, .........*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!`
` No, I don't want to believe it for a second...!!`
` Alright, I'll test Battler to see whether he really understands everything...!!`
` {f:5:Erika}!"`
`"Too bad, {f:5:Erika}.`
` .........I know you were excited to be appointed as the territory lord of this fragment, but I'm stripping you of that title."`
`"The new territory lord of this fragment is Ushiromiya Battler.`
` ......*giggle*, is it awful? Tell me, tell me, don't you feel just awful?!`
` How's it feel to have that title ripped away from you just when you'd finally gotten it?! How's it feel?!"`
`"Ahh,`
` ...waaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ahh{0}h{0}h{0}hggh!!"`
`"Battleeeeeeeeeeee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}er!!!`

` The theory I've created has no holes!!`
` It's impossible to rule out Natsuhi as the culprit!!"`
`".........`
`{p:1:I can construct a theory with someone other than Aunt Natsuhi as the culprit}.`
` ......It may be that your truth is impossible to disprove.`
` ......If so, that means your truth won't be able to deny my new truth either......!"`
`Battler spoke with the red truth allowed him by his status as a sorcerer.`
`"A......a culprit other than Natsuhi...?!`
` ...H‐......hah!! And how?!!`
` Dlanor!!`
` Please entertain Battler‐san's delusional rambling...!!"`
`......Slowly, ......Dlanor stepped forwards.`
`In her hand......was the red longsword of the Decalogue.`
` She also had a blue shortsword.`
`In Battler's hand......was the golden longsword.`
`......The two rivals once again...`
`......no, for the first time,`
` ......they truly confronted each other.`
`".........Battler, I have been {f:5:waiting}."`
`"Sorry to keep you."`
`"Not at {f:5:all}.`
` Your return was sooner than I {f:5:anticipated}."`
`"Kill him,`
` Dlanor A. Knoooooooooooxxxx!!!"`
`Dlanor's form disappeared in an instant.`
`{n}As though her slow, dignified movements from before were only a lie...!`
`......The trail drawn by the longsword of red truth burned itself into the retinas of those who saw it.`
`Before anyone had enough time to follow that trail, ......it was already approaching Battler's chest...!`
`"{p:2:Lady {f:5:Erika}'s reasoning has solved the fifth {f:5:game}.`
` No new facts exist to overturn this logically derived {f:5:truth}}...!!"`
`"{p:1:It's possible to present a different truth using a different interpretation}!!`
` When multiple truths exist in parallel, the authenticity of both is questioned!!"`
`In this closed‐off world, it's possible for differing truths to exist at the same time.`
`Furthermore, as long as multiple truths exist, it's impossible to claim that any of the truths are the single truth.`
`In other words, even if I can't overturn Erika's reasoning, by questioning its credibility...`
`......and conquering it, I can defeat it...!`
`"Bern's reasoning is perfect. You won't be able to overturn it easily.`
` ......But still.`
` If you can present a theory on par with Bern's, the fight will come down to a verdict.`
` That means it's possible that either one of the truths will be defeated and denied!"`
`".........This plot twist is truly laughable...!!`
` I'd expect nothing less from a demon's script!!"`
`"Then let me {f:5:ask}!!`
` If not Natsuhi, who do you theorize is the {f:5:culprit}?!!"`
`Battler's golden longsword drew both red and blue trails at will.`
`"{p:2:It's possible to construct a theory in which this was the revenge of the baby from 19 years ago mentioned by Aunt Natsuhi in her confession}."`
`"{p:1:Knox's 1st:`
` It is forbidden for the culprit to be anyone not mentioned in the early part of the {f:5:story}!`
` A person first introduced in the fifth game cannot be named as the {f:5:culprit}}...!!"`
`"{p:2:What if the baby from 19 years ago was among us since the very beginning?`
` For example, ......what if it was me}?!"`
`"{p:1:Knox's 8th:`
` It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not {f:5:presented}}!`
` Was there ever any foreshadowing showing that you might be the baby from 19 years {f:5:ago}?!!"`
`"{p:1:The red truth from the fourth game that I am not the son of my mother Asumu.`
` The feeling that Dad was hiding something in both the first game and this game.`
` In particular, in this game, it was made clear that there were some special circumstances having to do with my birth}."`
`Battler proposed that he might be the baby from 19 years ago,`
` ......and announced that he would reconstruct the crime with himself as the culprit.`
`As Dlanor cautiously held her sword at the ready, she gauged the distance between them...`
`Now that Battler had inherited the position of this world's territory lord and even attained the rank of Endless Sorcerer,`
` his movements surpassed {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} understanding.`
`By now, the physical distance between them probably counted for nothing.`
`Because their extremely agile battle was surpassing the point where the concept of distance made any difference.`
`"......A good {f:5:start}.`
` Let us hear......your theory with Battler as the {f:5:culprit}...!"`
`"Yeah, I'll let you hear it.`
` I'll prove that this explanation also works,`
` ......and that you can't be certain Aunt Natsuhi is the culprit...!"`
`"<Good>!!`
` If you're supposed to be the culprit, that creates several contradictions!`
` I'll use those contradictions to reap your feeble truth!`
` I, Furudo {f:5:Erika}, the detective and the Witch of Truth...!!"`
`This time, Erika stepped forward.`
`......In her hand, there appeared a scythe like one a grim reaper might hold.`
`{n}A ruthless scythe for reaping everything that threatened her theory...!`
`"{p:2:It's only possible for the crimes to have taken place during the single hour after midnight}!!`
` {p:1:During that one hour, you were in the dining hall of the mansion}!!`
` {p:2:Therefore, it was impossible for you to commit the crimes}!"`
`"{p:1:It has not been specified that the time of death was during the single hour after midnight}.`
` {p:2:Therefore, it's possible that the crimes didn't occur between midnight and {nobr:1 a.m.}...!"`
`"I'll speak exclusively about the murders in the cousins' room!`
` {p:1:It is impossible for the crime to have been committed in the cousins' room between 1 a.m. and the time of the crime's discovery}!!"`
`"Dlanor, now!!!"`
`"{p:1:Knox's 8th:`
` It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not {f:5:presented}.`
` If the crime actually was carried out in the cousins' room, clues must have been {f:5:shown}.`
` Because clues were not given to the detective, Lady {f:5:Erika}, who was on the watch for any abnormalities inside that room until morning, such a crime is {f:5:impossible}}...!!"`
`"{p:2:The "time of the crime's discovery" refers to the point at which I let out a scream and everyone gathered there.`
` Even if it was impossible to kill them before that point, it was possible to kill them afterwards}...!!"`
`Battler used a blue flash to deflect both of the red truths that Erika and Dlanor had flung at him...!`
`Erika's eyes went wide.`
` After all, what he had said was completely absurd.`
`......At that time,`
` ......they still hadn't been killed...?!`
`Even though corpses were lying there with their necks sliced open?!`
`"{p:1:The deaths of the four in the cousins' room have been declared with the red truth}!!`
` Are you trying to use a witch illusion?!`
` Are you trying to resurrect George and the others using the concept of magic even though they were dead at the time?!"`
`"I see, since you believe they were dead by that point,`
` it must look to you as though the dead are being brought back to life...!`
` So this will probably be magic to you."`
`".........In that case, I won't be the one to take the next shot at you!"`
`"Shut it!!`
` How often do I have to say it?!!"`
`"{p:1:The deaths of the four in the cousins' room have been declared with the red truth!!`
` And their dead bodies were witnessed by a large number of people!!`
` And it's already been declared with the red truth that no examination of any corpse is ever mistaken}...!!"`
`"Take that, dead people!!!"`
`"{p:2:......To what point in time did that red truth refer?`
` Have you forgotten, Miss}?"`
`The fierce shower of red was blocked by a magical barrier set up by Ronove, who suddenly appeared right in front of Battler.`
`Now that Beato was gone, the demons shouldn't have been able to manifest themselves in the real world...`
`However, ......he "existed" here,`
` ......and calmly dealt with Erika's attack.`
`"Y‐...you, ......Ronove!!`
` H‐how did you get here...?!`
` Well, who cares, this all works out nicely. Now there's no need to go looking for you.`
` I'll capture you here and deny your existence too!!"`
`".........I'll leave it to you.`
` Teach her that you can't control everything with a single, arrogant truth."`
`"<Yes, Your Majesty>.`
` .........Well then, ...allow me to spar with you for a while.`
` Go ahead, Miss."`
`"{p:2:The red truth pronouncing them dead referred to what point in time, then, according to you?!`
` Are you saying you can pinpoint that?!`
` You can't pinpoint it, so you can't disprove that it declared them dead at the time of the crime's discovery}!!"`
`"{p:1:When this court was opened, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} made a proclamation.`
` She said this was a 24:00 answer session}!`
` {p:2:......They were pronounced dead at 24:00 on the second day, in other words, at the end of the game.`
` That does not deny the possibility that the murder occurred after the morning of the second day, after the so‐called "discovery of the crime"}...!"`
`"Then, you're saying......that the victims were alive at that time?!`
` Even though their necks were sliced open?!"`
`"{p:2:Did you see that yourself, Miss Detective...?`
` True, it has been said that no examination of any corpse is ever mistaken no matter who performs it,`
` ......but it has never been said that there was a rule against describing something other than a corpse as a corpse}."`
`Erika swung her scythe recklessly,`
` but Ronove blocked everything with elegant gestures made with the shield on one of his hands.`
`"S‐......so, at that point in time, no one was dead?!`
` Are you telling me...there weren't even wounds on their necks?!`
` But...in that case...why did Battler scream?!"`
`"{c:86EF9C:Never leave your feet unprotected}, little girl.`
` {p:1:.........Ushiromiya Kinzo is already dead at the starting time for all games}!"`
`"Huh?! Ah—"`
`A pitch black hole opened beneath Erika's feet and swallowed her up.`
`She could probably see through to the other side of the hole.`
`......It was the same thing you'd see if you looked down through the skylight on the ceiling of this cathedral.`
`"Lia!!"`
`"Yes."`
`{f:5:Virgilia} could already be seen in midair inside the cathedral.`
`As Erika fell from the heavens, {f:5:Virgilia} was right below her and thrust upwards with her divine spear glowing blue!`
`"{p:2:......Shouldn't you rethink your reasoning?`
` Kinzo doesn't exist.`
` Therefore, the way for the bodies to disappear in your theory breaks down}."`
`"{f:5:Correct}.`
` ......Unless someone other than Kinzo makes the corpses disappear, your theory {f:5:unravels}."`
`"Geh...`
`......gah...`
`......gammiiiiiiit, this is nothing...`
`......graggh...gah.........!!"`
`{f:5:Virgilia}'s blue divine spear skewered and pinned Erika in midair.`
`Erika struggled, filled with hatred, but she couldn't get it out easily.`
`Then, all around her,`
` ......several small, fast things clanged off the walls and surrounded her.`
`Seven people manifested at once.`
`"We are the Seven Sisters of Purgatory...!!`
` Know this, foe of our master!!"`
`"......You.........lowly paperweights.........!!"`
`"{p:1:After George's death, his body was never moved}!"`

`"{p:1:After Genji's death, his body was never moved}!"`
`"{p:1:After Krauss's death, his body was never moved}!"`
`"{p:1:Therefore, the bodies couldn't have vanished after being discovered!!`

`"AAAaaaaaarrggghhhhhhhghhh...!!!`
` And so what?!`
` Even without Kinzo, I can explain how......the corpses disa—......`
`......nnngg, ......gaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aggghhh!!`

` Me?! ...The detective?!!"`
`"Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrggghhhhh!!"`
`......Even with Kinzo's existence denied,`
` Erika was probably capable of escaping this pin by making only a small revision to her theory.`
`However,`
` ......to her, having to revise a theory she had already created...`
`.........was extremely......humiliating!`
`"Looks like you toyed around with your plan too much in order to corner Natsuhi like that."`
`"You played around too much with your reasoning.`
` ......At this point, your master isn't the only one who can speak of Kinzo's death with the red truth."`
`"This is what you get for playing around in the witches' darkness.`
` ......Know that, Furudo Erika...!"`
`"Nngh, ......gggh, ggh.........!!"`
`Of course, even Erika had doubted Kinzo's existence from the beginning.`
`However, in the trial that had taken place before,`
` no one except {f:5:Bernkastel}, as well as {f:5:Lambdadelta} who was going along with her, had been capable of denying Kinzo's existence.`
`And because of the willful silence of those two, she had been free to shape the truth about Kinzo in any way she desired.`
`She never expected that Battler......would become a witch......a sorcerer,`
` capable of using red without proof!!`
`However, she had her own Inquisitor who could also use red without proof to counter!!`
`"D‐Dlanoooooooooooorrrr!!!!"`
`"{p:1:Knox's 2nd!!`
` It is forbidden for supernatural agencies to be employed as a detective {f:5:technique}!`
` If you intend on showing that Kinzo has died with the red truth, I demand that you present evidence of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} truth supporting such a {f:5:statement}}...!"`
`"......Forgive me, you crazy old bastard."`
`"Go forth, Battler.`
` Step over my dead body...!!"`
`"{p:1:Presentation of evidence.`

`"{p:2:Can you prove that this is Ushiromiya Kinzo's {f:5:body}?!`
` No matter how much it resembles him, unless you can prove that it is him,`
` it is possible to claim that it is a substitute corpse from someone {f:5:else}!!`
` Can you show that it is Kinzo's body with {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} truth {f:5:alone}?!`
` In this one case, I will treat any rebuttal that uses only the red truth as {f:5:invalid}}...!!"`
`"......Ooh.`
` Any counter with the red truth will be invalid?`
` That's novel."`
`"It may be true that the existence of third‐party corpses has already been denied with the red.`
` However, if saying that in red is forbidden,`
` ......*giggle*, Battler has nowhere to run to.`
` Heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh!"`
`"That's right......`
` {p:1:In this closed‐off Rokkenjima, there is no objective way to show that this corpse is Grandfather's}."`
`"{p:2:And that itself suggests the possibility that this corpse is a body {f:5:double}!`
` This unidentifiable body cannot serve as proof of Kinzo's {f:5:death}}...!!"`
`"{p:2:......Checkmate...!!`
` My theory is rock solid}!!"`
`Dlanor had sealed off the red truth as a means of proving that Kinzo's corpse had been shown.`
`......Even with the power of witches, Battler couldn't argue back......!`
`".........How are you going to prove that the corpse is Kinzo's if the red truth is sealed?`
` It's impossible.`
` ...It can't be done...!"`
`"......Not with red or blue, ...right......?"`
`"{p:41:I guarantee that this is the corpse of Ushiromiya Kinzo}...!!"`
`Then,`
` ...when Dlanor...`
`...met with Battler's golden flash,`
` .........she was unable to fully block it with either her red longsword or her blue shortsword,`
` ...and she was blown backwards into the air...!`
`It was a direct hit......without any miscalculation.`
`Though she had always seemed as firm as a small giant before now,`
` she was finally blasted away and slammed against the wall as though she was the slender girl she appeared to be...!`
`"D‐......Dlanor?! Wh‐what are you......"`
`"......A splendid gold {f:5:truth}.`
` .........It is {f:5:valid}."`
`"......G‐......gold truth......?!"`
`The golden longsword, which had been drawing red and blue trails before now,`
` finally drew a trail which retained its divine golden color.`
`The truth it showed.........was neither red nor blue.`
`{n}.........It was gold...truth...!!!`
`"Wh‐what is that...?`
` Lambda, does this follow the rules?!"`
`".....................`
` ......Yes.`
` ......Gold truth, valid.`
` The gold truth...`
`......can only be used by the territory lord of this world...`
`...no, ......only by the Game Master himself!!"`
`"Wh‐......what did you say............?"`
`"......Gold {f:5:truth}.`
` A divine truth woven in a different fashion than the red {f:5:truth}.`
` ......Its strength is on par with the red {f:5:truth}.`
` ......It may sometimes be {f:5:inferior}.`
` But it is sometimes {f:5:superior}!!"`
`"That brilliant shine......is the proof that Battler‐kun has truly understood Beato."`
`".........I've shown it.`
` Shown that the corpse is Grandfather's."`
`"{f:5:Yes}.`

`Erika cried out in pain.`
` ......It wasn't the pain of her body being impaled.`
`It was the pain of her own theory being defiled...!`
`".........I see.`
` ......I thought this was nothing but a mishmash of narrative tricks...`
` ......Just when did it become........................`

` ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}hahah!!`
` What a crazy string of great works!!"`
`"Battler, it would be beyond boorish to say more.`
` Even without saying another word,`
` you've made your truth about the corpses' disappearance fully "understood"!"`
`"Yes, what you're thinking of doesn't conflict with any of the red in this trial so far!`
` I completely understand and accept your truth based around the revenge of the man from 19 years ago!!`
` I proclaim your truth established!!"`
`"Wha.`
` What the...?!`
` Why is that, Great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}?!!`
` He still hasn't explained everything...!!`
` I still have many ways to argue back, ......like Hideyoshi's locked room, the seal on Natsuhi's room and the button in the closet!"`
`"......Uh.`
` ......You {i:still} think it's possible for you to argue back against Battler...........?"`
`"Ggah, ......gwwaagghgghggghhh.........!!!!"`
`Only Erika, the one who was supposedly so intelligent, couldn't understand.`
`......She couldn't understand that Battler had already found the real truth.`
`"{p:1:Grandfather's absence has therefore been proven,`
` and the dishonorable relationship between Aunt Natsuhi and Grandfather has been removed from consideration}!!"`
`"{p:1:Aunt Natsuhi is pure and faithful!`
` I won't permit this vulgar tale you're all so fond of}!!"`
`".........B‐.........Battler‐kun......!!"`
`"{p:1:Furthermore.`
` Because doubts have been raised about the time of death for all who have died so far, the alibis for everyone besides Aunt Natsuhi are null and void}...!!"`
`"{p:1:The argument that the crimes couldn't have been committed by anyone except Aunt Natsuhi no longer stands}!!"`
`Dlanor, who must have risen to her knees at some point,`
` slowly stood up......`
`The flash from the golden longsword was still carved deep into her chest.`
`Though pain didn't show in her expression,`
` her awkward movements clearly showed how serious the damage she had taken was.`
`Even though she herself knew that this spelled the total end of the match...`
`...Dlanor didn't abandon her duty...!`
`"{p:1:However, in the cousins' room, you witnessed dead bodies which were impossible to {f:5:misidentify}...!`
` Are you trying to say that was a {f:5:falsehood}?!`
` ...Knox's 7th: It is forbidden for the detective to be the {f:5:culprit}}!!`
` The detective is obligated to have an objective point of {f:5:view}.`
` Your theory violates this {f:5:obligation}!!"`

`"{p:1:Knox's 8th: It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not {f:5:presented}!`
` Until now, you have been the {f:5:detective}!`

` Unless it was, you do not have the right to falsify your point of {f:5:view}}!!"`
`"{p:1:In this game,`
` when I figured out the device of the epitaph's riddle, I witnessed Grandfather.`
` ......As has already been shown in red, Grandfather doesn't exist.`
` It was impossible for me to witness him!`
` Therefore, it has already been shown that my viewpoint wasn't objective}!!"`
`"{p:2:It is possible that it was just a sheet or something fluttering in the wind and rain which you mistook for Kinzo.`
` It cannot be used as foreshadowing to form a basis for Knox's 9th...!!`
` Mistaking things for something else is a right permitted to all observers}!!"`
`"{p:1:There's the red truth which Beato showed during the fourth game!!`
` No person would mistake Ushiromiya Kinzo by sight}!"`
`It's the red truth Beato used to counter my blue truth claim that someone disguised themselves as Grandfather...`
`and thereby made it seem as though he had appeared.`
`{p:1:In other words, on this island, anything which might lead someone to visually mistake something for Grandfather, including someone else pretending to be Grandfather, {i:cannot ever work}.}`
`The scheme Aunt Natsuhi once put together to make it seem as though Grandfather was alive...`
`only involved her saying things like "he was here just a second ago" or "he's in his study alone now",`
` cleverly exploiting the relatives' blind spots to pretend he was there.`
`She never tried to make anyone mistake something they saw for Grandfather himself,`
` so there are no contradictions.`
`If she had tried to dress one of the servants in Grandfather's robe...`
`it would probably have been seen through in an instant......`
`It has been guaranteed that none of the characters in this tale...`
`would "mistake something for Grandfather by sight"...!`
`If someone still claims to have seen Grandfather, it becomes a "falsehood".`
`Everyone is permitted the right to falsify their observations...`
`...but there is one person who does not have that right.`
`And that person is...`
`“the detective”...!!`
`"{p:1:Because of the right granted by Knox's 9th, everyone is allowed to mistake a sheet in the wind for something else and talk mistakenly about what they saw.`
` ......However!`
` Mistaking it for Grandfather in particular is not permitted in this game due to the red truth}!!"`
`"......So, once you claimed to have seen Kinzo,`
` it was no longer misrecognition...`
`but {f:5:intentional}.`
` ......In other words, this disproves the objectivity of your viewpoint...`
`...is what you are {f:5:saying}......?"`
`In this case, unintentional {i:misrecognition} is not permitted by the rules of this game.`
`{n}However, it is possible to intentionally {i:lie about seeing} something you never saw...!!`
`And that is an action not permitted to a "detective" burdened with the responsibility of an impartial perspective......`
`"Forgive my crazy argument...`
` This is the end."`
`"No, it is {f:5:alright}."`
`............If a man like you had been in the {f:5:world},`

`......The noise which rang out across the cathedral...`
`......was the sound of Dlanor's longsword clattering to the floor.`
`Simply letting go of that was the same as resigning to the proud Dlanor.`
`Though the blue trail Battler had drawn was aiming right for the top of Dlanor's head, .........it stopped a hair's breadth away.........`
`If it hadn't, Dlanor would probably have been annihilated without leaving a single scrap of flesh behind.`

` {f:5:Bernkastel} declared this with a disgusted expression.`
`For all intents and purposes, ...it was as if {f:5:Bernkastel} had acknowledged Erika's defeat herself.`
`With eyes of shock and despair, Erika looked up at the master who no longer had any confidence in her victory...`
`"......I don't give a damn about your pride.`
` How long do you intend to shame yourself like that?`
` ......You, my double who's been granted the same blue hair as me, ......how long do you intend to hang there pierced through like that......?`

`Mumbling quietly, she made various revisions with the blue truth,`
` had them acknowledged by {f:5:Lambdadelta}, and finally had the blue spear smashed and was freed......`
`Though that blue truth did indeed explain how the bodies had disappeared,`

`"Yeah, that's right.`

` ......No matter how shabby it might be, I will not laugh at that {f:5:truth}."`
`"Uugh......uuuuughhhuuuuuu!!"`
`......The words of Dlanor, whom Erika had previously looked down upon, led Erika to once again thrash about on the floor, sobbing.`
`"And...`
`because no unique truth exists, everything is covered in darkness.`
` ......Therefore,`
` although both my theory and Erika's are impossible to deny, neither is the single truth.`
` They are uncertain things, neither of which can be denied, and neither of which is absolute...!!"`
`"And as long as there's no definite answer, the witch illusion still exists.`
` .........It isn't Erika who's allowed to expose that, and it isn't any of the rest of you, either.`
` ......It's me alone!`
` I won't let anyone expose {f:5:Beatrice}'s illusion except me!!!"`
`"The verdict is revised...!!`
` Because of the truth presented by Ushiromiya Battler, Erika's truth is no longer unique!`
` However, Erika's truth is impossible to disprove!`
` Therefore, both of their truths exist together!`
` The conclusion of the fifth game is rescinded!"`
`"The game goes back to being even!!`
` And I transfer the position of Game Master from myself to the Golden Sorcerer, Ushiromiya Battler!!"`
`"Ushiromiya Battler, step forward!!`
` I appoint you as the new Game Master!!`
` Will you accept?`
` You will, right?!`
` Do it, you new Endless Witch!!!"`
`"Yeah!!`
` I'm the new Game Master!!`
` I'll weave the sixth game...!!"`
`"Erika, let's settle things for good this time!!`
` Stand up!!"`
`"......Y‐......yes,`
` ......you bet I'll stand......`
` ......You will rue...`
`...giving me a chance to recover from this humiliation......!!!`
` My master, please give me an opportunity to fight with Battler again in the sixth game!!"`
`"............Sure.`
` Of course I'll give you a chance."`
`"Wow, incredible.`
` For you to "give someone a chance".`
` Isn't this a miracle? Witch of Miracles, {f:5:Bernkastel}."`
`".........Erika.`
` You've miraculously managed to escape with your life.`
` ......In the sixth game, ...Battler's game,`
` .........you had better expose the truth no matter what...`
` Unless you want to be tossed aside into the darkness of oblivion!!"`
`"Y‐yes, my master...!!!`
` .........D‐......Dlanor..."`
`"Of {f:5:course}.`
` I will give it my all in the next game as {f:5:well}."`
`"Heh, ......heheheheheheh!!`
` I won't pretend to be a guest any longer.`
` ......Together with Dlanor, I'll tear your game to bits!!"`
`"Sure.`
` I'll invite you to my sixth game...!!`
` Sorry, but that title of yours...{0}<Checkmate of the>...isn't cutting it."`
`"It's your game. You can decide the name yourself!`
` Just bring it on...!!`
` I, Furudo Erika, ............am a detective before I am a witch!!`
`"`
`"I acknowledge you as the new master of this game, ......and I declare war!!`
` I swear......I swear I'll expose everything you try to hide!! I'll kill you!!`
` Golden Sorcerer, Ushiromiya Battler!!!"`
`"Yeah, come at me with all you've got!!`
` Furudo Erikaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa!!!"`
`Just watch, Beato.`
` ......I'll take charge of your game!!`
`And in this next game, I'll prove that I completely understand all of your riddles...!!`
