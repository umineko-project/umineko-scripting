`{a:c:`
`"It's Natsuhi, please open up...!!"}`
`Natsuhi yelled as she knocked loudly and repeatedly.`
`Shortly after, there was a heavy clunking sound, and the sound of the door to Kinzo's study unlocking could be heard.`
`As the door opened, a heavily sweet venomous odor flowed out.`
`Natsuhi was always ashamed of how she automatically grimaced at that,`
` even though she thought it rude to the family head...`
`Krauss was waiting for her inside the study.`
`Natsuhi flew into his arms.`
`"......I‐is Father... ......Is he........."`
`"Calm yourself.`
` ......Doctor Nanjo is examining him now..."`
`With an uncertain gait, Natsuhi went towards the center of the study, supported by Krauss.`
`There, a dignified bed fitting for the head of the Ushiromiya family could be seen, along with Nanjo, Genji, and Kumasawa...`
`"Doctor Nanjo...`
` I‐...is Father......"`
`After sighing deeply, Nanjo left the side of the bed.`
`On the bed, Kinzo could be seen lying down, sleeping......`
`".........He died peacefully.`
` ...I don't think Kinzo‐san had any regrets."`
`"Ah, ...waa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahh{0}h{0}h{0}h{0}hhh...`
` Father... Fathee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}er...!!"`
`...Sobbing, Natsuhi put her head against the chest of the man who had fallen into a sleep from which he would never awaken.`
`"M‐......Madam, ...please, stay strong..."`
`"Father, Father......!!`
` This is...just too sudden......`
` Aaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!"`
`"..............."`
`Natsuhi couldn't stop her tears over the death of Kinzo, whom she had loved like a second father.`
`Kumasawa rubbed Natsuhi's back, consoling her......`
`Krauss slumped into his late father's favorite chair.`
`By sitting there, he might have been immersing himself in memories of his departed father.`
`Or perhaps he thought that by sitting there, he might be able to understand just a bit of the madness of Kinzo's later years,`
` which had eluded him to the end of his father's life...`
`Nanjo turned his back and looked down over the outside world through a crack in the curtains.`
`It was the same thing he'd often done when Kinzo sat in that chair contemplating a chess move...`
`"...If he was to die anyway, it would have been better if he was sick in bed for a year or so before dying.`
` I do wish he could have died after a grace period during which the proper arrangements could have been made."`
`"It's the other way around.`
` ......We should be glad that he was in high spirits until the very end."`
`"That will have to be my public stance, yes..."`
`Nanjo understood that as well.`
`This was the death of Ushiromiya Kinzo, a man who had risen like a comet and glittered like a supernova in the post‐war world of business.`
`His funeral would probably be of a fantastic scale.`
`{n}And it would also be the ceremony marking Krauss's inheritance of the headship.`
`He would have to arrange everything as the host of the event, carry out funeral diplomacy perfectly,`
` and make it clear that the Ushiromiya family would still hold enormous influence in the political and financial spheres.`
`As Nanjo watched Krauss, he was vividly reminded of the time when Kinzo had been suddenly selected as the Ushiromiya family head,`
` a time in which Kinzo had been lost and confused.`
`Nanjo could remember that well, and for that reason, he was able to understand Krauss's distress and sympathize with it...`
`Natsuhi's sobs eventually subsided.`
`Seeing this, and leaving Kumasawa to care for Natsuhi as a fellow woman, Genji returned to Krauss.`
`And he lowered his head slightly, as though asking what should be done.`
`"......Genji‐san and I will deal with the formalities.`
` Krauss‐san, perhaps you should contact the relatives first."`
`".................."`
`Krauss, with his hands still over his eyes, didn't respond...`
`Perhaps even though he had known this day would come, Krauss really couldn't hide his shock at how suddenly it had reached them.`
`"......Leave this to Doctor Nanjo and me.`
` Krauss‐sama, I suggest that you first speak with Madam."`
`Maybe she heard that, or maybe it was a coincidence.`
`{n}As though responding to Genji's words, Natsuhi came over.`
`Her eyes were red from crying so much,`
` but she apparently understood the heavy responsibility that had been imposed on the two of them even better than Krauss did.`
`"As of now, you are the head of the glorious Ushiromiya family.`
` Let us show our relatives and the world that you have splendidly succeeded your father.`
` ......As your wife, I am prepared to serve you until the day our coffins are laid down alongside each other."`
`".................."`
`Trying to encourage her husband who was overcome with shock, Natsuhi lent him some reassuring words.`
`When Krauss finally lowered the hands that had been covering his face,`
` ...he looked up at the ceiling with a blank expression and let out a deep, deep sigh...`
`"......Please, stay strong.`
` There are a great many people who will intend on helping themselves to everything Father has left behind.`
` We must fight to protect Father's honor and wealth.`
` That is the first responsibility of the Ushiromiya head."`
`"...I understand.`
` I do understand."`
`"Doctor Nanjo, Genji, please take care of the legal and funeral arrangements.`
` Especially you, Genji.`
` I ask that you take particular care and see to it that the funeral will be a fitting one for Father."`
`"......Certainly."`
`"And Doctor Nanjo.`
` Father didn't pass away in a hospital, ......so..."`
`"Yes.`
` An autopsy might indeed be required depending on the circumstances......"`
`"Is there anything you might be able to do about it...?`
` Even though he has passed away, Father's body is precious.`
` Any damage to it would not be acceptable..."`
`"I understand how you feel.`
` ...However, it is important to follow proper procedure where things like this are concerned.`
` And, umm, ......I don't really know how to say this.`
` I fear that several of your relatives might be difficult..."`
`......There was no way to know what those inheritance vultures might try to find fault with.`
`They might squawk that there was something suspicious about the cause of death, and use that as a point of contention to start some trouble.`
`Right now, not only was it important to pay Kinzo's remains the respect they were due, but there was also a need to focus on solidifying the position of the new family head, Krauss...`
`"......I understand.`
` In that case, please keep it to an absolute minimum.`
` And whatever you do, please make absolutely sure that Father's dignity remains unharmed."`
`"That I can assure you.`
` Please don't worry.`
` ......In any event, leave Kinzo‐san to us and stay by Krauss‐san's side.`
` ...Things are only going to get tougher for him."`
`"I understand.`
` ......And you too, dear...please stay strong."`
`".................."`
`Krauss was still staring lazily at the ceiling with a befuddled expression on his face...`
`Natsuhi understood the shock and heavy responsibility.`
`{n}She felt that she understood her husband's feelings as well as anyone possibly could.`
`"......I will contact the relatives.`
` Please rest for the time being."`
`"............"`
`Krauss didn't respond.`
`...Natsuhi thought that he was being a little bit weak, but that just made it all the more important for her to support him right now.`
`Seeing her husband like this actually stirred Natsuhi up, and a resolute expression rose to her face.`
`"Things are going to get busy.`
` Let's get started with whatever we can do right now.`
` .........I'm sure my husband wants to have some time alone with Father.`
` We should step out for the time being."`
`"......Yes, I think that would be best...`
` After all, I expect this will be the only time he'll have."`
`Being in charge of a funeral is tiring work.`
` There's no time to shed tears.`
`If Krauss were ever to be given time to cry for his dead father, that time would have to be now.`
`Everyone agreed with Kumasawa's words.`
`Even then, Krauss continued to lazily gaze up at the ceiling and didn't respond in any way.`
`Natsuhi urged the servants to go.`
`"I'll go talk to Jessica too.`
` ......She is the successor to the head now.`
` I'll have to impress upon her that she needs to be appropriately aware of it."`
`{a:c:`
`"Wait."}`
`As they each started to make their way out of the study, Krauss finally spoke.`
`They stopped walking.`
`"Yes?"`
`"......Wait."`
`".........Yes??"`
`Hadn't she already stopped walking, just like her husband had asked?`
`{n}But despite that, he had once again told her to wait.`
`From those slightly weak words, Natsuhi understood that he had probably stopped her because he wanted her to be by his side.`
`"The rest of you, downstairs.`
` I will stay with my husband.`
` Please call us on the phone if anything happens."`
`"......Certainly."`
`{e:150:"I said {i:wait}!!"}`
`When Krauss suddenly raised his voice, everyone jumped and turned around...`
`Unable to comprehend what she had done to spark her husband's wrath, Natsuhi ran up to him.`
`"What's wrong, dear...`
` Have I said something rude...?`
` If so, please forgive me."`
`"No, no, that's not it, that's not it...`
` Wait a second, give me some time."`
`"Yes, I understand.`
` It's important to have time to sort things out inside your heart.`
` ...We were just going to leave quietly to give you the time you need..."`
`"And I'm telling you to wait before doing that......`
` ......Listen, just no one move.`
` Not even an inch...`
` ......If you're tired, then feel free to sit in whatever chair or sofa you want.`
` So just stay quiet and shut up in silence, don't do anything, just stay right there!"`
`......Those unreasonable words felt like a glimpse of how Kinzo used to be.`
`Natsuhi couldn't hide a slight surprise at those words, which made it seem as though Kinzo had possessed her husband.`
`Natsuhi told the servants to wait for the time being.`
`She ordered them to sit in a sofa a short distance off, approached her husband, and spoke to him in a small voice...`
`"......If you order it, I will wait however long you ask. I won't move.`
` So please, try and calm yourself..."`
`"...No, ......that's not it, that's not it..."`
`Was it really his father's blood, or was he actually being possessed?`
`Krauss's disorderly style of speech strongly resembled Kinzo's...`
`As she watched this, Natsuhi felt with even greater certainty that Krauss was indeed Kinzo's son,`
` and that he was the true successor to the head, more suitable than any other person.`
`".........Natsuhi.`
` Over here."`
`Krauss stood up and headed towards the window, trying to lengthen the distance between himself and the servants waiting on the sofa by even a small amount.`
`Natsuhi realized that he must have something secret that he wanted to talk about.`
`"...Yes, dear?`
` ......What is it...?"`
`"............Dad dying...`
`would be bad."`
`"Would be? But he has already passed away.`
` We can't change reality..."`
`"That's not it.`
` ...Now is...a bad time..."`
`"......What do you mean?"`
`"I've been putting Dad's fortune up as collateral.`
` Once the issue of dividing the inheritance comes up, I won't be able to hide it...!"`
`"Wh‐...what...?`
` C‐collateral, you say?`
` How much...?"`
`"...You remember how I helped out Kondo‐kun with Melody Land?"`
`"Didn't I tell you to break ties with that person?`
` You told me you'd refused him...!`
` Why?!"`
`"There is such a thing as a man's honor!`
` I couldn't refuse!"`
`Krauss claimed to hold honor as a virtue.`
`...However, Natsuhi knew that he most often used this as an excuse after he couldn't bring himself to pass up a deal.`
`"Th‐that wouldn't be a problem if we had plenty of money on hand...!`
` But didn't you borrow quite a lot of money for the plan to turn this island into a resort?!"`
`"Yeah, I did!`
` And there were people here and there who lent me a hand along the way!`
` If I'm going to repay them, I can't just sit around on my hands!"`
`"You need money to repay people!`
` You need money to make money!`
` You can't even get started without money!`
` And even the plan for this island would be proceeding smoothly if only there hadn't been problems with the planning company!"`
`"I had the cooperation of government officials.`
` I even had the governor's personal guarantee that this would become the newest travel destination in the Tokyo Metropolis!`
` The groundwork I laid was completely perfect!!`
` Random chance and bad timing were against me!`
` It was just a bit of bad luck.`
` Like a traffic accident!!"`
`"That was no accident!`
` It was fraud!`
` You were tricked!!`
` They were never drawing up plans for making this island a resort in the first place!!"`
`"That's not true!!`
` Hijikata‐kun's vision was simply overflowing with foresight!`
` The way his eyes always focused on the whole world and the future taught me that things I always believed to be mere dreams were only the tip of the iceberg of what is possible!!`
` Expand your dreams! To the whole world, to the future!`
` You heard him say that too, didn't you?!"`
`"Yes, I did...! And I think I remember telling you what I thought after we returned home!!`
` I said that he was suspicious!`
` That he only spoke of dreams and didn't have his feet planted on the ground,`
` and that you must not have any further relations with him!!"`
`"Hijikata‐kun is a wonderful, pleasant young man!!`
` One could learn a lot from the way he lives!`
` I can respect him despite his youth!`
` I won't have you insulting him!!"`
`"That's what you said about the whole moon tourism thing!!`
` You kept saying it was visionary, that it looked to the future, that it had high aspirations, and what was the end result?!`
` Eventually, even you yourself admitted that it was utter nonsense!!`
` I was sure something was wrong from the moment that strange man showed up claiming to be a high‐ranking NASA official!"`
`"The only issue was that foreigner who was an international swindler!`
` {nobr:Mr. Sonezaki} and I were {i:both} victims of that incident.`
` Even now, his vision isn't mistaken!`
` There will definitely come a time when space tourism will become a popular indulgence for the world's richest.`
` And the very first enterprise in that area will probably be monopolized by a single, private company.`
` That viewpoint is not mistaken!`
` There is simply a group of international swindlers who are trying to take advantage of that fact and deceive investors across the world—"`
`"And I'm trying to tell you that this Sonezaki man was one of them too!!`
` Just how gullible are you? Why do you always just accept these suspicious offers without any doubts?!!"`
`"Take that back!`
` {nobr:Mr. Sonezaki} is a man with a brilliant future ahead of him!`
` There's nothing suspicious about him!!`
` Because the dreams he speaks of anticipate the future, they sound crazy to people who can't look that far ahead!`
` A woman like you can't see into the future!!"`
`"Yes, a woman like me can't see into the future!!`
` But I can see the present!`
` Right in front of me, I can see a pitiful husband who's been taken in by sly, double‐crossing swindlers and still trusts them implicitly even after he's been tricked!!"`
`"Oh, shut up!!`
` You don't understand anything about money or business or economics!!`
` Don't try to butt in on the job of the husband!!`
` All a wife needs to do is the housework!`
` You just keep quiet!!!"`
`"...............!`
` ........."`
`Without another word, Natsuhi fell silent, just as Krauss wanted.`
`{n}She was already far beyond anger and sadness.`
`And the emotion that lay on the other side of those...was an almost indifferent pity.`
`Krauss had always been frightened of Kinzo since the days of his youth, and had come to subconsciously admire the way his father lived.`
`...Without realizing it, he had come to believe that he could only be recognized as a man in his own right if he surpassed his father.`
`However, Kinzo had been a mad genius, the likes of which had never before been seen in the Ushiromiya family's long history.`
`His talent was a gift from heaven,`
` ......and it definitely wasn't genetic, much less something that could be learned.`
`Natsuhi instructed the servants not to tell anyone about Kinzo's death,`
` and dismissed everyone for the time being, to give the two of them a chance to talk alone.`
`Then, she invited Krauss to her bedroom,`
` ......and made him tell her everything about their current financial situation.`
`They were things that Natsuhi hadn't been told about under the assumption that a woman had no business knowing.`
`Natsuhi had herself made a point of avoiding this area in the past, thinking that it wasn't a wife's place to intrude on such matters.`
`However, this might also have meant that she had been remiss in her duty as a wife to protect her family.`
`The depths of this sin had been made quite clear to Natsuhi...`
`Krauss was probably tired of trying to defend himself.`
`{n}Perhaps because he had gotten a headache, he hid his face and sank into silence...`
`Natsuhi noticed that the water in the electric kettle was boiling and stood up to refill her cup with black tea.`
`And when she touched the cup of black tea, she noticed for the first time.`
`The sound of the cup and saucer clinking together told her that her fingers were shaking...`
`Krauss had built up a large debt to obtain funds for his various projects...and to cover the losses when they failed.`
`Of course, he had put the mansion and property up as collateral.`
`However, doing such a thing above board would have resulted in the mortgage being registered.`
`In other words, there would have been a record that Krauss had put Kinzo's wealth up as collateral to obtain a loan without anyone's permission.`
`Krauss couldn't afford for Kinzo, Eva, and the others to learn of such a thing.`
`Therefore, he had been putting those assets up as collateral using the worst possible method.`
`".........I signed over the deeds and power of attorney..."`
`"And...what does that mean......?"`
`What Krauss was saying probably meant that he had, in essence, signed away the rights to their assets.`
`If those assets had been used as collateral for a loan, then Krauss would have had some options under the law.`
`He would have had to deal with a bank, which would have absolutely no compassion,`
` but they would have been able to work something out within the rules set by society.`
`......However, signing away the deed and power of attorney was a whole different story.`
`In short, even the mansion they were living in was at risk.`
` If the person holding the deed were to decide to ignore his agreement with Krauss and sell the mansion to a third party right this moment, they would have no recourse whatsoever.`
`Far from using their house as collateral for a loan, this was basically the same as selling it to borrow money...`
`"...In other words, ...the moneylenders have the power to make or break the Ushiromiya family as they please.`
` If they were to suddenly sell our house on some slight whim,`
` ......we'd have to pack our bags and leave right now, wouldn't we...?"`
`"That is technically true.`
` However, all of the people I have arrangements with are very reputable.`
` They aren't loan sharks.`
` These are transactions based on trust between economically literate men."`
`"I trust them.`
` And they, in turn, trust that by lending me money, I will achieve great success in business and give them massive returns on their investment.`
` I signed over the power of attorney as a sign of good faith and so that they wouldn't have to doubt in the certain success of my enterprises."`
`"What happens if I hesitate now?`
` Wouldn't that mean even I have no confidence in my own ventures?!"`
`".................."`
`If your ventures had been successful, we wouldn't be in debt now, would we...`
`{n}...Natsuhi only barely stopped herself from saying it.`
`"......Father is dead.`
` What happens next?`
` Your debt will be exposed to the light of day, and your siblings will hold you responsible?"`
`"............That won't be all.`
` ......It will probably lead to criminal charges..."`
`"C‐criminal charges......`
` Wh‐why is that......?"`
`".........It's better if you don't know.`
` ......The point is...we can't allow anyone to find out about this......"`
`"..............."`
`Krauss looked at the floor shamefully, shaking his head over and over......`
`If it would come to criminal charges, ...then he must have broken some laws.`
`He had probably been so intent on raising a large sum of money that he hadn't paid any heed to appearances.`
`......Krauss had seriously believed that his many projects would definitely succeed and return huge profits.`
`So he had figured that even if he broke a few laws, he would be able to pay everything back before too long and pretend that the whole thing had never happened.`
`......This might have lessened his resistance towards breaking a couple laws.`
`And now Kinzo's death, the worst possible thing, had occurred, and soon he wouldn't be able to keep it all hidden......`
`"......What will happen to us?"`
`"Th‐there is no need to worry...`
` You may not believe, but conditions are most certainly on the rise now.`
` The value of the city real estate I invested in is rising rapidly."`
`"I have a project in progress to consolidate those and construct a massive business tower.`
` This is the most reliable of all my investments so far, and it's proving to be the most successful."`
`"......However, it will take a little more time for it to bear fruit.`
` It's absolutely certain to do so, but it will not happen immediately..."`
`"......Will the success of that venture be enough to pay back our debts?"`
`"Of course it will.`
` I'll be able to write off all of the debt I've accumulated so far...!!`
` So believe me.`
` I only need a little more time!"`
`"But Father has already passed away!`
` We don't have that kind of time anymore!"`
`"I know, I know that...!!`
` That's why...I have to obtain money from somewhere and pay off those debts right now!"`
`"I need money, that's what it comes down to...`
` Money, a lot of it, right now!!`
` Aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aarr{0}r{0}rgghh{0}h{0}h{0}hh...!!"`
`Krauss roared and clutched his head, writhing about as if in pain.`
`As Natsuhi watched, several conflicting emotions swirled about in her chest.`
`{n}She felt pity for her husband, but at the same time, she felt he was a fool.`
`......And she also felt a mixture of anger and regret towards her own irresponsibility in letting her husband run wild for so long.`
`It should have been clear to him well before today that they were in a very critical situation.`
`And yet he had irresponsibly waited for this moment to come and was now writhing about.`
`......Her husband was so foolish......and pitiful.`
`{n}It was easy to feel frustrated with him.`
` ......However, she was his wife.`
`For a wife to ridicule her husband as a fool would run in conflict with her responsibilities.`
`...If he was a fool, then she would have to support him to compensate...`
`However, she didn't have a clue what she was meant to do about this...`
`If there was a massive amount of money like that within easy reach,`
` there was no way that Krauss wouldn't have already laid his hands on it......`
`It would also be easy to tell him to be a man and give up on everything.`
`{n}But that would also run in conflict with her responsibilities.`
`She was Ushiromiya Natsuhi.`
`......The woman who had become Krauss's wife and sworn to support him, the new head of the Ushiromiya family, for as long as she lived.`
`She had to somehow help her husband in his efforts to raise money.`
`......She understood it logically.`
`But she couldn't suppress the indescribable feeling of dejection that seemed to rise up from the dark depths of her heart......`
`"That's right, D‐Dad's hidden gold...!`
` Ten tons of gold is worth 20 billion yen!`
` If I had that...`
` That's right, if I had that, everything could be resolved...!"`
`"Natsuhi, that's it! The witch's epitaph!`
` Let's solve that, let's solve it together!`
` If we can just find the gold, everything will work itself out!!`
` That's right, it must be hidden somewhere on this island!!`
` If we had that, if we had that!!"`
`"Y‐you're hurting me...`
` Dear,`
` ......p‐please, stop this......"`
`Krauss, acting as excited as if he'd thought up a perfect, brilliant plan, grasped Natsuhi's upper arm tightly.`
`Natsuhi couldn't help but be dumbfounded.`
`It wasn't just because she'd heard something as fake‐sounding as the hidden gold brought up.`
`Krauss usually disparaged the story of the hidden gold,`
` saying that it didn't exist and that it was all a fiction his father had created to borrow a lot of money.`
`Natsuhi was doubly taken aback because of this...`
`"I know, let's have Jessica help us too.`
` Maybe some things can only be solved with the sense of a child!`
` This is a family crisis.`
` All of us have to stick together!!"`
`"Yes, it's just a fanciful little puzzle that Dad created...!!`
` We should be able to solve it... There's no way we can't solve it...!`
` It's the only way!!"`
`"Oh, Natsuhi, this is wonderful,`
` we still have an option left, and right here next to us!!`
` The gold is on this island!!`
` If we had it, everything would be resolved!"`
`"Waha, waha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!`
` Natsuhi, call Jessica here right away!`
` Let's overcome this family crisis as a family!!`
` Yes, right now!!`
` The gold is on this island, it's right beside us!!`
` ......Wah!!"`
`Natsuhi knocked Krauss aside, unable to withstand the pain in the arm he was twisting in his excitement.`
`Krauss tripped over the edge of the bed and flopped pathetically onto the floor...`
`"P‐please get ahold of yourself!!`
` And please calm down...!!`
` Do you really think that this Ushiromiya family crisis......could be solved by saying something as dream‐like as that...?!!"`
`"N‐.........Natsuhi........."`
`"Please, cool your head off and think of a realistic plan to gather money...!!`
` I'm going to go cool my head off as well......!"`
`"...Wait......Natsuhi......"`
`Maybe falling over had knocked the sense back into him.`
`{n}Krauss tried to tell Natsuhi to stop, but she just kept walking.`
`Closing the door forcefully, Natsuhi dashed away......`
`Natsuhi ran through the corridor.`
`She didn't want anyone to see her like this, but she ran headlong into Genji......`
`"......My deepest apologies.`
` Madam, have you been injured...?"`
`"I, I'm alright.`
` Leave me alone...!!"`
`".........Certainly."`
`"Oh, ......Genji.`
` ...What's the state of Father's study?"`
`"......It is just as you left it.`
` Doctor Nanjo is in the parlor."`
`"I see...`
` ......Do you have the key to the study?"`
`"Yes.`
` Right here."`
`"Give it to me.`
` ...Let me have some time alone with Father.`
` If my husband asks where I am, tell him you don't know."`
`"......Certainly."`
`After grabbing the key to the study that Genji was holding out to her, Natsuhi rushed up the stairs.`
`She then flew into the study,`
` ......and finally, ...she cried out loud.`
`".........Father......`
` Please forgive our foolishness...!!`
` My husband and I...`
`...aren't capable of inheriting all that you created...!`
` Please......please,`
` ............forgive us for our foolishness and our crimes...`
` And,`
` ...if you can forgive us,`
` .........please guide the way for us fools......"`
`Clinging to Kinzo as he slept in the bed, Natsuhi cried even harder.`
`She kept imagining Kinzo sitting up suddenly and patting her head.`
`No, Father isn't the type of person to pamper...`
`{n}More likely, he'd yell at me to stop being so noisy.`
`......However, neither of these imaginations would come true.`
`{n}...Because it was an undeniable fact that Kinzo had entered an eternal sleep.`
`{n}But even so, Natsuhi begged the sleeping Kinzo to forgive and help them...`
`It had only been a few hours since his passing.`
`Perhaps his soul was still here, listening to her.`
`......Believing this, Natsuhi begged for Kinzo's forgiveness and help even more earnestly......`
`{a:c:`
`"Noisy woman.`
` Don't I always say that I value silence?"}`
`".........Huh—"`
`That voice made Natsuhi jump up in surprise.`
`When she faced in the direction that the voice had come from, .........she saw Kinzo sitting at the study desk, folding up his reading glasses...`
`"Did you get in a fight with Krauss again?`
` ......Neglecting his wife...that Krauss only inherited my bad traits."`
`"F‐.........Father......"`
`"......What a wretched‐looking face.`
` Wash it.`
` Aren't you the wife of the successor to the Ushiromiya family?`
` You mustn't let the servants see you wear such a shameful expression."`
`"Y‐......yes, Father...`
` ...My apologies......"`
`......Natsuhi understood.`
`This was just an illusion, ...one that Natsuhi had created from her desire to speak with Kinzo and her memories of the man as he once was.`
`No, that's not it...`
`......She believed that just for now, Kinzo's soul had shown itself to her.`
`She was sure that doubting this would cause it to vanish in an instant...`
`"It seems that a family crisis has arisen the very instant the headship was passed on..."`
`"Y‐...yes, Father......`
` I wasn't able to support my husband...`
` ......I am truly...very sorry......"`
`"Hmph.`
` The Ushiromiya family is so very cursed.`
` It was in a terrible state when I succeeded the headship too.`
` The hardships you two are suffering are trivial in comparison."`
`Kinzo's succession to the family headship came suddenly.`
`At the time, he was nothing more than a young man from one of the branch families, far separated from the Ushiromiya main family.`
`The main family might have had honor and tradition, but that was of no relevance at all to Kinzo, and he couldn't have cared less.`
`Then, the principal members of the main family were wiped out in the Great Kanto Earthquake, along with their businesses.`
`On top of that, there was a complicated antagonism between the members of the family at the time,`
` and the elders were all trying to impose their will on the others in that sinking ship.`
`Because of this, they weren't even able to elect a leader to rebuild the Ushiromiya family.`
`They found common ground by selecting Kinzo, a youth with absolutely no ties to any of the opposing elders, to be the head.`
`So the elders hadn't really entrusted Kinzo with the rebuilding of the Ushiromiya family.`
`Kinzo had been nothing more than their puppet, with his arms and legs being pulled in opposite directions......`
`".........Yes.`
` ...I know a lot about your days of suffering, Father."`
`"And then the war started.`
` I was already tired of life at that point.`
` I hoped to die on the battlefield, but I wasn't sent to the front lines.`
` ......However, the state of the war grew worse with every day, and the time for the decisive battle on the Japanese mainland seemed to grow ever closer.`
` As bad as it might sound, I hoped that day would come quickly..."`
`It was said that as Kinzo listened to Death's approaching footsteps day in and day out,`
` ...he started cutting his ties with this world one by one.`
`And then, on that day when he had freed himself from all his attachments to life, and reached a state of enlightenment......`
`...he had a mystical experience.`
`......And he met her.`
`{n}The Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}......`
`"I made a contract with the witch and was given gold and the power of madness.`
` ......On that day, the old me died, and a new me possessing the insane power of magic was born."`
`"...I know.`
` And after the war,`
` you used your ingenious cunning to revive the Ushiromiya family."`
`The now‐deceased elders who knew Kinzo at the time...`
`had whispered to each other that Kinzo must have taken a knock to the head on the battlefield and returned with a different personality...`
`That was how much Kinzo stood out after the war.`
`Whether the story about Kinzo meeting a witch was true or not,`
` there could be no doubt that the extraordinary experience of war had prepared him for death...and let him reach a state of enlightenment.`
`Natsuhi must surely have felt that if Kinzo had decided to describe that resulting mystical experience as a meeting with a witch, that wasn't something she could flatly dispute...`
`"......That's right.`
` ...You returned from the war,`
` conquered the witch {f:5:Beatrice}, and became the head of the Ushiromiya family in the truest sense..."`
`"Correct.`
` Before I met {f:5:Beatrice}, I was nothing more than a puppet and only the head in name.`
` ......I only became the head after conquering the Golden Witch."`
`"......Father......`
` Will this...Golden Witch...aid my husband Krauss now that he's the new head...?"`
`"Oh, she will.`
` Assuming that he has truly succeeded the headship."`
`"Wh‐what do you mean by "truly succeeded"......?"`
`"I mean it depends on whether he bears the responsibility and pride of the Ushiromiya family head in the truest sense.`
` ...Natsuhi, you should understand this.`
` The headship is not inherited by blood.`
` It is inherited through spirit and conviction.`
` ......Even though Krauss is my eldest son, he cannot be called the true head if he does not possess these things!"`
`"And even someone other than Krauss would make a splendid new head so long as that spirit dwelled in their heart.`
` The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} will lend her power to that true head.`
` .........Isn't that right, {f:5:Beatrice}?!!"`
`When Kinzo called the witch's name, ......gold butterflies seethed out of every corner of the room.`
`This fantastical scene had an otherworldly beauty to it.`
`It was like standing in the midst of a blizzard of golden flower petals being blown about a rose garden of gold.`
`As Natsuhi stared at this scene in shock, the gold butterflies gathered and formed a human shape...`
`Then, ......the witch of the portrait appeared...`
`"Indeed.`
` I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......I am free to run rampant!`
` I do not listen to anyone's orders."`
`"And there's only one person in the world who can control her.`
` Me.`
` ......That is why I am qualified to be the Ushiromiya family head."`
`"Hmph.`
` So that pride of yours is what qualifies you to be the head?"`
`"Pride implies self‐confidence and bravery.`
` And, it is the embodiment of the insatiable desire to gain the power to match.`
` ...That is why I control you."`
`".........It is quite pleasant to watch men who speak of pride as they turn that desire into reality.`
` The "quiet man of action" is nothing more than an excuse used by the extremely lucky.`
` ...A true monarch also speaks of what he doesn't have.`
` And he makes sure to turn that arrogance, that pride, into reality.`
` ......If one is to control me, they must possess that monarch's pride."`
`"Do you understand, Natsuhi?`
` A true monarch fears no hardship.`
` They declare that they will overcome anything without fail.`
` Even if they haven't yet figured out how.`
` This gives hope to the weak people.`
` They gather, revere the monarch, and swear to assist him.`
` That is where power is gained and his word is carried out.`
` Engrave that into your heart."`
`"Y‐.........yes, Father......"`
`Natsuhi understood.`
`Through this mystical experience, ...Kinzo was teaching her the attitude required to overcome hardship.`
` ...Even after his own death.`
`Feeling a warm sensation rise up in her chest, she let the valuable words Kinzo had given her echo through her mind over and over.`
`......A true monarch,`
` ...in other words,`
` the true head of the Ushiromiya family...was not to fear hardship.`
`They had to believe that they could overcome any hardship...`
` If they could not believe themselves capable, then there was no reason why they would be...`
`.........Natsuhi suddenly felt very ashamed of the way she had come into this room,`
` sobbing and asking Kinzo what to do...`
`"I......was foolish..."`
`"..............."`
`"...Of course there's no time for crying when an Ushiromiya family crisis is upon us.`
` And now that we have inherited the Ushiromiya family from you, Father, we must protect its honor no matter what."`
`"Hoh.`
` ......Even though you can't even draw a blueprint on how to repay Krauss's debts?"`
`As {f:5:Beatrice} laughed unpleasantly,`
` ......no, that wasn't it.`
`{n}She was testing Natsuhi, to see whether she possessed the mental readiness to be a true monarch.`
`Natsuhi didn't hesitate anymore.`
`{n}She answered clearly, gazing into {f:5:Beatrice}'s eyes.`
`"Yes.`
` At this moment, I have not yet discovered the method that we should pursue.`
` However, my husband is the new head of the Ushiromiya family, and I am his supporting wife.`
` So in my husband's place, I will proclaim it."`
`"Let us hear it."`
`"Ushiromiya Krauss and Natsuhi will definitely overcome these trials and protect the honor of the Ushiromiya family.`
` You have nothing to worry about, Father."`
`"......You do know the scope of Krauss's debt, as well as the disastrous state things are in?"`
`"Yes.`
` Things could hardly be worse—we could even be ordered to leave this mansion tomorrow, and we wouldn't be able to refuse.`
` Once the distribution of the inheritance comes up, his relatives might even file a criminal complaint against us."`
`"However, there is no need to worry.`
` We will repay all of the debts before then and restore our honor."`
`As she stood at attention with a resolute attitude,`
` Natsuhi proclaimed this clearly with Ushiromiya Kinzo and {f:5:Beatrice} as witnesses.`
`For a while,`
` they remained silent, as though weighing Natsuhi's resolve.`
`Then Kinzo chuckled and turned away...`
`"......How vexing.`
` ...Why couldn't this person have been my son..."`
`"The very fact that a woman with such a disposition married your son is another sign of your great luck."`
`"............`
` {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` This is my final order."`
`"Now that you are no longer the head, I am not obligated to obey your orders."`
`"Hoh.`
` In that case, obey the orders of the new Ushiromiya family head."`
`"You are no longer the head, and Krauss is not yet the head.`
` Whom are you suggesting that I serve?"`
`"I will leave that to you.`
` It is up to you to decide who is qualified to succeed the Ushiromiya family head, and who is fitting to bear the mark of the One‐winged Eagle.`
` ......You will be witness."`
`"I refuse.`
` I won't listen to the orders of a man who isn't the head."`
`"No, this is different.`
` This is a will.`
` The last order that the head left behind for you."`
`"......*cackle*.`
` Then it seems I will have to obey.`
` What a good friend I am."`
`"I think not."`
`"Hoh?"`
`"You're only doing this because it caught your interest."`
`"I can't hide anything from you, can I?"`
`"Natsuhi."`
`"Yes, Father..."`
`"Go and overcome your hardship."`
`"...Y‐.........yes."`
`To Natsuhi, that might have been nothing more than a simple response,`
` but to Kinzo and {f:5:Beatrice}, it seemed to carry much greater significance.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} nodded deeply,`
` and with a motion as elegant as her dress, she bowed deeply before Natsuhi...`
`"The Ushiromiya family alchemist, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}, right here.`
` I will give you my aid so that the Ushiromiya family can overcome crisis once again..."`
`"......Thank you.`
` I will need your power.`
` We will most certainly overcome these trials."`
`"I will not hold back on my support for your cause, but there is something I must warn you about beforehand.`
` I understand that your troubles now could be solved if I were to bestow a vast quantity of gold again, like I did when I saved Kinzo from his crisis.`
` However, that is something I cannot do."`
`".........I see."`
`"Sorry, Natsuhi.`
` The contract for {f:5:Beatrice}'s gold stated that it cannot be inherited.`
` It was agreed that it could only be passed on to another if that person solves the witch's epitaph."`
`"The gold is sealed away by the epitaph.`
` As long as that is not solved, I cannot give you the magic of gold."`
`".........I understand.`
` Then I shall search for another method by which we can save ourselves from this crisis.`
` ......My husband said that his plan would take time, but he also said that it would definitely be sufficient to repay our debts.`
` If we can buy enough time for that to happen, we will be able to overcome this trial."`
`"Good, Natsuhi.`
` Continue."`
`"But Kinzo is already dead.`
` The doctor and servants are preparing his funeral,`
` and you will be contacting the family members about it.`
` The window of opportunity for you to raise money will be closed by your own hand.`
` *cackle*cackle*, how charming is a guillotine where you lower the blade yourself..."`
`"..................Ah—"`
`Natsuhi gasped and looked up at the ceiling.`
`There wasn't actually anything there.`
`{n}......But even so, Natsuhi had found something.`
`"So, ......the magical power has descended."`
`"Natsuhi.`
` ......Have you made up your mind?`
` What magic of miracles do you desire from me?"`
`......All of those who had witnessed Kinzo's corpse were once again gathered in the study.`
`Krauss was still very unsettled and clutching at his head.`
`Genji was as expressionless as ever.`
`Nanjo and Kumasawa wore bewildered expressions on their faces.`
`But in stark contrast to all of them, Natsuhi's expression was resolute.`
`"Dear, let me ask you one more time.`
` Your plan for raising money is absolutely certain?"`
`"......Y‐......yes.`
` Give it a year, ...no, just half a year, and it will certainly bear fruit!`
` But it's just impossible to hope for anything right this second......"`
`"Then we will wait."`
`"B‐but you said it yourself.`
` ......Dad is already dead......"`
`"Father hasn't passed away.`
` As you can see, he is as healthy as ever."`
`When Natsuhi said this, everyone looked up instantly, startled.`
`{n}...Because they immediately understood what those words meant...`
`However, Krauss alone didn't get it right away and had to ask.`
`"What......`
`do you mean by that......?`
` Dad is right there,`
` and he's......"`
`"I will say it again.`
` Father is still in good health.`
` He is busy with his research, so he'll be even less able to leave his study than usual.`
` Because of this, we must handle all external affairs ourselves,`
` so that Father can devote himself to his research without being burdened by meaningless tasks."`
`"In short, nothing will change from the way things have been up until now.`
` .........Do you understand, Genji?"`
`"...............Yes.`
` ...The furniture of the One‐winged Eagle will continue to serve the Master."`
`"Kumasawa.`
` And you, Doctor Nanjo.`
` Do you understand what I'm saying?"`
`"......Oh, ...uh, ......ummm..."`
`"I‐......is this really what you want to do, Natsuhi‐san......?"`
`"It may be true that Father passed away today.`
` But if everyone here right now believes, we can use magic to revive Father."`
`"I‐it's impossible, Madam...`
` That's just too much...!"`
`"The time of death will be determined during the autopsy.`
` We can't stop it from looking suspicious...!"`
`"Father will not pass away, so there will be no reason for there to be an autopsy."`
`Of course, she wasn't planning to make Kinzo live forever.`
`The fake life given to Kinzo would only last until Krauss could repay his debts.`
`After that, Kinzo's soul would finally be able to sleep in peace.`
`Nanjo repeated himself that the time of death would be discovered during the autopsy, but Natsuhi said again that this wouldn't be a problem.`
`"Father will not pass away by being reported dead."`
`"A‐.........ah, I see.`
` ......He'll be reported missing...!!"`
`After clapping his hands together, Krauss stood up, shaking his fists.`
`"Yes.`
` Once we've managed to pay back the debt and finish the preparations to lay Father to rest, we will then announce that Father has disappeared."`
`Rokkenjima's vast, uncultivated forest was the perfect place to stage a disappearance.`
`One day, Kinzo would go out to the forest for a walk and never return.`
` ......They would search for him without success and then be forced to report his disappearance...`
`"If he disappears, we can file a report of his death even without a corpse.`
` In other words, we can conceal the time of death!`
` What do you think, Doctor Nanjo?!`
` There won't be any problems this way!"`
`"Y‐......yes, I can see the logic, but......"`
`"...Are you sure about this, Madam...?`
` Y‐yes, if all of us can keep quiet, then perhaps we could keep it a secret that the Master has passed away...!`
` But there are so many ways that one of us could slip up and allow someone to find out...!!"`
`"Kumasawa.`
` Keep your voice down.`
` ......Have you forgotten that Father is sleeping right over there?`
` Are you trying to wake him?"`
`It isn't a corpse.`
` ...Kinzo...is sleeping.`
`As Natsuhi said that,`
` ......Kinzo lay quietly on the bed, as though there was nothing at all odd about her words.`
`"Come, try to remember.`
` What form did you have?`
` What sort of life did you enjoy?!"`
`Once again, a storm of gold butterflies started to swirl, covering Kinzo's cold body...`
`Then, after the butterflies exploded into fine gold powder and disappeared,`
` .........just like those fairy tales that have been told over and over since long ago, ......Kinzo slowly opened his eyes and sat up...`
`".........F‐......Father......!!"`
`"......Natsuhi.`
` Let me first make one thing clear.`
` I did not coax you into doing this because I have an attachment to life."`
`"You liar.`
` Don't tell me you didn't anticipate this at least a little.`
` How does it feel, Kinzo?`
` How is your body?"`
`"It isn't bad, but it feels somewhat like being in a dream.`
` I feel light."`
`"A being not permitted to remain in this world still remains here.`
` You'll have to accept a little discomfort."`
`"...Is your body truly alright?!`
` Are you really...alright...?!"`
`"Mm.`
` Actually, this feels quite pleasant.`
` ......If this is what the world after death feels like, playing the part of a ghost might not be so bad."`
`"How is this, Natsuhi?`
` Kinzo has revived.`
` That means a funeral is unnecessary.`
` Your hardship has been resolved!"`
`"......B‐{f:5:Beatrice}..."`
`As Natsuhi tried to find words of gratitude,`
` {f:5:Beatrice} waggled her index finger and spoke.`
`"There is no need for thanks.`
` A ruler should be proud.`
` I do not pay heed to requests, but I do follow orders."`
`"I'll say it even so.`
` ......Thank you.`
` This way, ......you've bought some time for my husband...`
` ......We will handle the rest."`
`"Be warned, Natsuhi.`
` Kinzo may have revived, but that is not an eternal thing.`
` It will only continue as long as my magic does."`
`"......Be warned that the anti‐magic toxin might destroy the magic.`
` You must understand the laws of magic correctly and work hard to maintain it.`
` I can show you a miracle, but it is your role to grasp it and hold it together."`
`"Of course.`
` We won't neglect the miracle you have given us."`
`"Very good.`
` ...I see... It seems masters do need to be changed every once in a while, just like floor mats.`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` I like it.`
` I shall serve you."`
`"Ushiromiya Natsuhi!`
` I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}...!!`
` Call my name whenever you wish. I shall then appear and grant you a miracle."`
`"Thank you.`
` I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi.`
` I will employ you to protect the honor of the Ushiromiya family...!!"`
