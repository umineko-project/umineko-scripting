`.........All of the pieces from the game board were gathered.`
`All of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, furniture, witches, and the witches on an even higher level...`
`...had gathered in one place.`
`That place was like a solemn cathedral, with an unbelievably high ceiling.`
`White stonework.`
` Golden ornaments.`
`Though there were windows, there were no entrances nor exits.`
`{n}It was a strange, strange place.`
`But for some reason, no one wondered where this strange place was.`
`......Because they were not given the right to think of this place as strange.`
`"Pieces.`
` Are you all gathered?"`
`"All present, ma'am."`
`"Good work.`
` ......What a spectacle.`
` I wonder just how many people there are here."`
`"............No matter how many we see, every being outside the 18 is an illusion."`
`"Making you acknowledge them is what my game's all about.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`The three witches were seated on special thrones set upon a very high balcony.`
`In the center sat the Game Master, {f:5:Lambdadelta},`
` and on either side of the semicircular balcony sat {f:5:Bernkastel} and {f:5:Beatrice}, facing each other.`
`Below them, Erika ran forward, lifted the corners of her skirt and bowed respectfully.`
`"Great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, I thank you for granting my request for an assembly.`
` ......And Great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, my master.`
` You can expect great things from this assembly.`
` Though it may be only for a short while, I will most certainly make you forget about the poison that torments you."`
`"Yes, great things are what I expect.`
` .........Because you are my double,`
` and my piece."`
`Erika and {f:5:Bernkastel} exchanged nasty smiles that would make anyone want to avert their gaze.`
`"Hear me, witches, {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s!!`
` I hereby announce the assembly of a witches' coven! The Court of Illusions is now in session!!"`
`The ruler of the game spoke with words of power.`
`Though her words were spoken inside such a vast space,`
` they rang out with the force of a bell in a bell tower...`
`"Your lives and roles within this game are over!`
` The fifth game is hereby closed, and the 24:00 answer session shall begin!`
` ......I'd love to get started right away, but why don't we have everyone quickly introduce themselves first?`
` Since there's so many of us here."`
`"Eheheheheh!`
` I am {f:5:Lambdadelta}!`
` The Witch of Certainty and the new ruler of this game!"`
`".........{f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` Witch of Miracles.`
` ......My goal is to penetrate {f:5:Beatrice}'s witch illusions."`
`"I am the Endless Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` My goals are to assert my own existence and to protect Natsuhi and Kinzo."`
`"................................."`
`"......Battler‐sama.`
` You come next in rank."`
`".........I'm Ushiromiya Battler.`
` I'm fighting Beato's—no.........I'm fighting the witches.`
` ......That's all."`
`"As I believe you know, you joined in on this game partway through.`
` This means that at the time the coven commenced, you were not yet a participant.`
` Do I need to explain further...?"`
`"I get it.`
` ......You mean I don't have the right to speak for the time being, right?"`
`"Thank you for understanding."`
`Even though Battler held a rank second only to the witches,`
` he sat on the foremost pew with the other relatives, all by himself at one end.`
`He met the gaze of Beato, who was up on the balcony.`
`"You could simply have said you were my arch‐enemy."`
`".........Well, you aren't necessarily my only enemy."`
`"Hmph...`
` .........Let's take this game back.`
` It belongs to us."`
`".....................Yeah."`
`I almost said that I was fighting Beato's witch illusions.`
`{n}............Originally, Beato was my one and only enemy.`
`But now, ......Erika and those witches who started tampering with Beato's tale...`
`...are my enemies as well.`
`Who should I fight and how?`
`{n}Maybe it's a good thing I won't have the right to speak for a while.`
`I'll keep a cool head and calmly watch everything unfold......`
`"I am the detective and the initiator of this coven, Furudo Erika.`
` I will expose the culprit of the fifth game and bring this tale to a pleasing conclusion."`
`Erika greeted the witches above her and the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s behind her once again.`
`"I'm looking forward to your performance too.`
` Okay, remaining pieces, introduce yourselves in whatever order, and make it quick."`
`"{y:0:Human}{n:0:Human}s!`
` Introduce yourselves, all of you...!"`
`Urged by 45 to introduce himself, Kinzo stood up.`
`"......I am Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
` I slipped out of the study window and am hiding somewhere on Rokkenjima."`
`"Ushiromiya Krauss.`
` I have been captured and am currently being confined somewhere."`
`"I'm Ushiromiya Eva.`
` I'm alive."`
`"I'm Rudolf.`
` ......The rest of us are all Ushiromiya too, so let's just skip the family name."`
`"I'm Ushiro—......Rosa.`
` I was killed on the first twilight."`
`"Jessica.`
` Same here, dead on the first twilight."`
`"I'm George.`
` ......Likewise, I died on the first twilight."`
`"Maria.`
` I died, but look, I'm here talking.`
` See?`
` Dying isn't a big deal, right?`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi..."`
`"I'm Ushiromiya Natsuhi.`
` ......I am alive."`
`"............Eheheheheheheheh."`
`"..................kh..."`
`"Hideyoshi here.`
` I was killed just a short while ago."`
`"Kyrie.`
` I'm still alive."`
`"Nanjo......`
` I am also hanging in there..."`
`"My name is Genji.`
` .........I died on the first twilight."`
`"I'm Shannon.`
` ......I'm still alive."`
`"I'm Kanon.`
` I'm also alive."`
`"I, I'm Gohda.`
` Pleased to meet you, everyone......"`
`"I am Kumasawa...`
` Pleased to meet you......"`
`"Now, on to the witches!`
` Everyone, introduce yourselves!"`
`{f:5:Virgilia}'s group could also be seen.`
`There was a second balcony, different from the one Beato's group was on, which jutted out like raised audience seating.`
` They sat there, looking down as though they were at a theater...`
`".........My name is {f:5:Virgilia}.`
` I am {f:5:Beatrice}'s master in magic."`
`"I'm Gaap.`
` Making corpses disappear is my job."`
`"Ronove.`
` I am charged with making the tea.`
` Pu ku ku..."`
`"I greet you in the name of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory.`
` I served in the murder of Hideyoshi on the second twilight."`
`""""""The Seven Sisters of Purgatory, right here!""""""`
`"Let us then have Lady Erika's furniture introduce themselves."`
`"Gertrude.`
` I am an Assistant Inquisitor."`
`"Cornelia.`
` I am an Assistant Inquisitor."`
`The two of them could also be seen on the second‐floor balcony.`
`{n}They sat apart from {f:5:Virgilia}'s group.`
`Then, ......Dlanor, who was seated between the two, slowly stood up.`
`She had a presence and dignity about her, as though she was overseeing everything from that place.`
`"Dlanor A. Knox is my {f:5:name}.`
` .........I am Lady Erika's primary {f:5:assistant}."`
`"........................"`
`"Battler.`
` I am expecting a lot of {f:5:you}.`
` Please do not disappoint {f:5:me}."`
`"......Let's just both give it all we've got."`
`"Most of the time, there will be no need for Dlanor to step forward.`
` However, when the witch side plays around with ugly word games, I'll need to have Dlanor pass judgment on them.`
` ......The miracle in the study will not occur again."`
`"..........................."`
`"And finally, let us introduce ourselves.`
` We are the Chiester Sisters Imperial Guards, who have been tasked with management of proceedings at this coven."`
`"H‐hello, everyone...!!"`
`"Nyeh nyeh{p:0:♪}"`
`"This ends the introductions of all pieces.`
` A total of 38 people are present here!"`
`The number of characters was 38 if you only took the fifth game into account,`
` but if you added all the pieces who appeared in previous games too, it would probably rise even higher.`
`This mysterious game, which had so often been likened to chess, now had far more pieces than a chessboard.`
`"Good.`
` Then I guess we'll get started.`
` Initiator, please begin!`
` ......Oh, excuse me, you, the goat over there.`
` Refill my drink."`
`"......And some popcorn for me."`
`"Oh, that's right.`
` .........It {i:was} you who decided that popcorn was the only proper accompaniment to demonic theater, after all."`
`"Yes, I intend to enjoy this.`
` .........And could I get some black tea and mustard miso?`
` Erika, begin.`
` I'm already starting to get bored."`
`"Yes, my master, leave it to me...!!`
` Order!! Silence!"`
`At the sound of her voice, the Chiester Sisters troops straightened up, lifted their right knees, and stamped down hard on the floor with their heels.`
`It became a low, deep rumble in the ground, which instantly erased all chatter in the cathedral...`
`and turned their eyes and expressions even more hollow and empty.`
`......The room fell back into silence, almost as though they were a collection of wax models...`
`Amidst this heavy silence, there was the sound of footsteps...`
`as Erika walked out into the center where she could catch everyone's attention.`
`When she signaled with her chin, a goat attendant appeared from behind a pillar,`
` .........and carried a single, plain chair out into the front and center of the room.`
`It must have been......the defendant's chair.`
`"I, Furudo Erika, will make an accusation.`
` The murderer of the fifth game is—"`
`"Ushiromiya Natsuhi‐san.`
` You are the culprit."`
`Erika pointed at Natsuhi and spoke......`
`The Natsuhi wax doll alone...twitched and regained its expression.`
`{n}......It was an expression of panic.`
`"Chiester Sisters.`
` Please take the defendant to her chair."`
`"Understood."`
`"Wait, ......what are you doing?!!`
` Let go of me!!"`
`45 and 410 pinned Natsuhi's arms behind her back...`
`and led her to the chair in the center.`
`Natsuhi resisted, but the Chiester Sisters were surprisingly strong, and she couldn't do anything.`
`She turned to the relatives for help, but they just remained silent like wax models...`
`"I, Furudo Erika,`
` will now reconstruct why the crime was only possible for Ushiromiya Natsuhi."`
`".........Beato.`
` Of course, you'll be defending her, right?"`
`"Naturally.`
` I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, {f:5:Beatrice} the Golden.`
` ......Furudo Erika, I accept your challenge.`
` I shall take these false accusations you're trying to place on my master...`
`and tear them apart!!"`
`"B‐...{f:5:Beatrice}......!"`
`"Fear not, Natsuhi.`
` You are my master.`
` And you are the true head, with the One‐winged Eagle engraved in your heart.`
` Do not fear a crime you have not committed."`
`At those words, Natsuhi jerked back, ......and gulped.`
`{n}Her panic finally disappeared, and she stood up straight.`
`"...Th‐that's true...!`
` I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi!`
` I will confront any challenger who would dare blaspheme the name of Ushiromiya!"`
`".........*giggle*.`
` How can you make such an empty boast in a situation like this?`
` ......You really are the bullied kid in every single fragment."`
`"So, Bern.`
` Make your claims."`
`"I, {f:5:Bernkastel}, claim...`
`...that a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, Ushiromiya Natsuhi, is the culprit of this game."`
`"And you too Beato, okay?"`
`"I, {f:5:Beatrice}, claim...`
`that the culprit in this game is not {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}!`
` I am the culprit!"`
`{f:5:Bernkastel}, who smiled daringly, and {f:5:Beatrice}, who smiled firmly, crossed gazes.`
`"Do you hear this, witches, {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s?!`
` Two claims have appeared for a single truth!`
` Is the culprit the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} Ushiromiya Natsuhi?`
` Or is the culprit the witch {f:5:Beatrice}?!"`
`"If the witch wins, the truth of the fifth game will disappear into darkness.`
` If Erika wins, the witch illusion will be wiped from the game board.`
` ......In other words, for Beato alone, this is a battle where losing is not an option. Are you prepared?"`
`"And what am I supposed to be preparing myself for?`
` This is what I've been craving all along...!"`
`......If Erika were to win, the witch illusion would be destroyed.`
`That would mean the existence of the witch would be denied.`
`{n}Beato was fighting for her life.`
`However, this wasn't the only time she had been fighting for her life.`
`{n}.........It had always been a life‐or‐death struggle, even when she fought with Battler.`
`...Because if Battler had won and broken through the witch illusion in any of the previous games,`
` Beato would have been destroyed.`
`"......That's dirty.`
` Erika's the only one with nothing to lose if she fails."`
`"I wouldn't be so certain of that.`
` ......Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} is not a compassionate person.`
` ......I can't imagine she'd give any warm treatment to a piece that didn't perform as she had hoped..."`
`It was inconceivable that the ruthless {f:5:Bernkastel} would place no blame at all on a piece who had suffered defeat.`
`......Erika was probably fighting for her life just the same.`
`The two claims would clash, and one would be weeded out.`
`One would fall...and would not leave this place alive......`
`The only ones who truly had nothing to lose......were those witches.`
`"OK, no problems!`
` Now begin!!"`
`".........In that case,`
` I would like to go first.`
` The murder of Hideyoshi‐san is very simple.`
` It should be impossible to suspect anyone other than Natsuhi‐san.`
` Except for the victim and Natsuhi‐san, all of us were in the same room, correct?"`
`It really was simple.`
`......Everyone except Natsuhi was in the parlor.`
`{n}And because it was so simple, it was decisive......`
`"......No matter how you look at it, the one who killed Hideyoshi was Natsuhi.`
` No, it's the other way around.`
` ......No matter how you look at it, no one except for Natsuhi could have killed Hideyoshi.`
` There's no room for discussion or debate."`
`"I, I'm telling you, you're mistaken...!!`
` It may be true that I don't have an alibi.`
` However, I don't believe a lack of an alibi proves that one is the culprit...!"`
`"Hmph, I understand that Natsuhi is the only one without an alibi.`
` But wait.`
` The scene of the murder was a locked room.`
` It should have been impossible for anyone, including Natsuhi, to have committed the crime in that room.`
` Except for me, since I could have done it with magic."`
`"I'll explain the locked room trick—the howdunit—later.`
` We are starting with the whodunit for the time being.`
` ......So for the reason I just mentioned, it's impossible to suspect any character except Natsuhi‐san for the murder of Hideyoshi‐san."`
`".........Milady.`
` It may be dangerous to press any further on this."`
`"I agree.`
` It's a fact that Natsuhi was hiding in the closet of Hideyoshi's room.`
` ......If they use a repetition request to check her location, we'll be cornered."`
`"......Probably.`
` Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} is the ruler of this game.`
` ......If it suits her fancy, she'll set up Natsuhi as the culprit regardless of the facts."`
`If the typhoon were to pass and the police were to come and perform a scientific investigation,`
` perhaps the true culprit {i:would} be identified and the false accusations against Natsuhi lifted.`
`However, the police would never arrive at this closed‐off Rokkenjima.`
`......In other words, the real truth would never be revealed.`
`Inside a cat box that will never be opened, false charges that everyone accepts have exactly the same value as the truth.`
`"Their aim is most likely to use the simple murder of Hideyoshi to give the impression that Natsuhi‐sama is the culprit...`
`before moving on to the first twilight's reconstruction, which has more uncertain elements."`
`"It's not good at all to proceed while under the Game Master's suspicion.`
` We should take the initiative."`
`"Indeed.`
` ............Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}!`
` As you are well aware, a fair number of murders were committed during the fifth game,`
` and we are skipping the rather lengthy chunk of time from midnight until the early morning."`
`"Skipping to Hideyoshi's murder...`
`and stepping backwards and forwards in time will only lead to confusion.`
` It is my belief that we should follow events chronologically and in order, though the decision is yours, of course."`
`"Objection.`
` Chronological order has no significance in the process of building a case against the culprit."`
`"Objection.`
` Furudo Erika is trying to manipulate perception in her favor by mixing up the chronological sequence."`
`"Ugh, I don't like it when things get all muddled either.`
` I accept Beato's claim.`
` Erika, start with the first twilight instead of jumping to the second."`
`"...............Tch."`
`I definitely saw Erika click her tongue.`
`......Now I understand.`
` This is {i:how the tales of Rokkenjima are created}.`
`After being guided by {f:5:Virgilia} and meeting {f:5:Beatrice},`
` ......now I stand here, at this peak from which I can see everything below me, and I finally understand the truth of this world.`
`"This is......that thing you talked to me about before."`
`".........Yes, that's right.`
` Truth is very fragile in this place."`
`"As long as each side makes its own claim, different truths can exist at the same time..."`
`Yes.`
` This really is a trial.`
`{n}Both sides put forth their own truths.`
`This here truly is the Braun tube trial that {f:5:Virgilia} once used as an analogy......`
`"Then I will follow Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s orders and start from the first crime at the first twilight.`
` As you know, at midnight on October 4th, the first day,`
` following a short break in the family conference, Natsuhi‐san left on her own, saying that she was going to bed early.`
` Therefore, her alibi is completely lost from that time until the next morning."`
`"Oh, is that so?`
` I believe there are several people besides Natsuhi who have dubious alibis.`
` Unless you can clear suspicion from all of them, I cannot allow you to call Natsuhi the culprit."`
`"True.`
` If Erika wants to claim that Natsuhi is suspicious,`
` she should first show that everyone besides Natsuhi has an alibi.`
` Right, Bern?"`
`".........Yes, of course.`
` Erika will provide a complete explanation that covers everyone."`
`"Of course, my master...!`
` In that case, I would like to explain things in order.`
` Let's forget about Genji's murder for now and focus on the crime in the guesthouse.`
` The inclination here is to suspect the servants who were in the guesthouse, yes?`
` On that night, Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san were in the guesthouse.`
` Isn't that right, you two?"`
`She turned to face the direction where those two people were seated, ......and just those two wax models came back to life.`
`When they weren't allowed to speak, they probably weren't even granted a soul.`
`In that case, it would have been much better if Natsuhi's soul could simply have disappeared as well...`
`......Natsuhi, who was in the defendant's chair, kept her soul the whole time, and was constantly hanging her head, looking nervous...`
`Gohda hurried to his feet and answered Erika's question.`
`"Y‐yes, that is correct.`
` On that evening, I was alone in the guesthouse servant room..."`
`"Well, look at my age.`
` Staying up the night would be a heavy burden, so I returned to the servants' quarters in the guesthouse...`
`and went to bed right away on my own... Yes, you'd better believe I did...!"`
`"......Doesn't that mean Gohda and Kumasawa have lost their alibis?!!`
` Kumasawa claims that she was sleeping alone in the servants' quarters.`
` Gohda claims he was alone in the servant room.`
` Either of them should have had enough time to go to the cousins' room and commit murder!!"`
`"N‐n‐nonsense...!`
` Why would we do something like that...?!"`
`"That's right, that's right...!`
` How could we ever kill another person...?!"`
`"Natsuhi said it all.`
` Both Kumasawa, who was sleeping alone in the servants' quarters, and Gohda, who was alone in the servant room,`
` are in the exact same situation as Natsuhi in her room.`
` Both of them have lost their alibis."`
`"Have no fear.`
` I guarantee that neither of these two are murderers.`
` Firstly, Kumasawa‐san—following dinner, she left the mansion with me and the others and went to the guesthouse,`
` entered the servants' quarters, and slept until morning.`
` It's the same for Gohda‐san.`
` Once he finished with his job, he chatted with us in the lounge and went to sleep afterwards.`
` Neither of them had the opportunity to commit murder."`
`"Hmph.`
` So, we're finally here."`
`"......I see that it's time for me to stand up as well.`
` Your turn is over already, Erika.`
` ...Go summon that bodyguard you rely on so much."`
`Beato glanced at where Dlanor sat on the second‐floor balcony.`
`{n}......However, Dlanor just stared back with those usual expressionless eyes.`
`"Repetition requested.`
` "We have absolute proof of Gohda and Kumasawa's alibis"."`
`"Decline repetition.`
` .........Why give a hint to an enemy?`
` There's no way we'd answer."`
`"Hah!`
` Did you hear that, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}?`
` They say they have no proof!`
` Is it acceptable for them to claim that Gohda and Kumasawa have alibis without proof?!"`
`"Good point.`
` What do you say, Bern, Erika?`
` How can you claim that Gohda and Kumasawa have alibis?"`
`"Stay out of this, Erika.`
` My opponent is Dlanor over there.`
` A mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} like you is not fit to argue with a witch!"`
`".............................."`
`"No.`
` There's no need for Dlanor to step forward.`
` .........In fact, it is precisely this, a "mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}" defeating a witch, that will spell the end for the witch illusion.`
` ......So go ahead.`
` Use the red and blue as much as you like.`
` ......I'm ready for you."`
`In response to Erika's challenge, Beato smiled boldly yet gracefully and slowly stood up.`
`And they glared at each other between the floor and the balcony......`
`"{p:2:Gohda and Kumasawa have no alibis.`
` The two of them were in the guesthouse and could have reached the cousins' room to commit murder at any time.`
` Unless you can eliminate that possibility, you cannot treat Natsuhi as the culprit}."`
`Beato's blue truth struck out rapidly.`
`{n}The curtain had finally dropped, and the battle had begun......`
`"......A {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} like Erika can't use any red.`
` How could she turn this around without calling Dlanor?"`
`"Though Erika cannot use it, her master, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, can.`
` ......We mustn't let our guards down."`
`"Blue truth, valid.`
` ......What'll you do, Bern?`
` Will you or Dlanor step in instead?"`
`"It is still not my {f:5:turn}.`
` And it is not Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}'s turn {f:5:either}."`
`"......Yes, that's right.`
` There's no need for us to show up for something like this.`
` ......This is important precisely because a mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} like Furudo Erika will defeat you, Beato."`
`"......Because you'll be defeated by a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, we'll know.`
` We'll all know that the fake witch who calls herself "{f:5:Beatrice} the Golden" is nothing more than a sub‐{y:0:Human}{n:0:human} illusion."`
`"*giggle*giggle*...`
` If you really can do that, it'll be seriously interesting...`
` Okay, Erika.`
` Let's see what you've got...!"`
`"I will begin with Kumasawa‐san. It is extremely simple.`
` Kumasawa‐san, stand."`
`"Y‐.........yes...!"`
`"Kumasawa‐san, from the time you went to bed last night...`
`to the time you were informed about the crime in the morning, did you ever leave the servants' quarters?"`
`"No!`
` I was sound asleep until morning, I really was!!"`
`"The truth is...`
`......after dinner last night, I had a chat with Eva‐san, and she told me something very interesting.`
` ...And I tested it out myself."`
`"What are you talking about...?`
` ......You don't mean..."`
`"That's right.`
` It's what cornered and sealed Kinzo in the study.`
` ......I learned that you can create a seal by putting something between a door and the frame."`
`".........Are you kidding...?`
` Did she actually......do that to the servants' quarters where Kumasawa‐san was sleeping?!"`
`"Erika was in the guesthouse, so there's no obstacle to her having been capable of that."`
`"After all, it was an unsettling night, and a massive amount of gold had just been discovered. Many sorts of crimes might have occurred.`
` ......Where there is a detective, there will be a crime.`
` I foresaw that some kind of crime would take place,`
` so I used this to seal away people whose alibis might otherwise be lost."`
`Erika held a small, folded piece of brown paper high in the air.`
`"After I watched Kumasawa‐san, who returned to the guesthouse with me, say goodnight and enter the servants' quarters,`
` I used this to seal the door."`
`"Then, in the morning,`
` when the crime was discovered and caused a big uproar, I immediately went to check Kumasawa‐san's quarters,`
` where I confirmed that the seal was still intact.`
` Therefore, I can prove Kumasawa‐san's alibi!"`
`".........<Good>.`
` A wonderful alibi. Absolutely airtight.`
` Kumasawa returned to the guesthouse with Erika, went to the servants' quarters to sleep, and never left the room until morning.`
` {p:1:In other words, after Kumasawa returned to the guesthouse, she never went to the second floor until morning}."`
`The proof Erika had shown was elevated by {f:5:Bernkastel} and became red truth.`
`This truth, which had become red, could no longer be overturned, even by Beato...`
`In other words, in that instant, Kumasawa's perfect alibi had been absolutely guaranteed.`
`"Hohoh!`
` Then what about Gohda?!"`
`"Gohda‐san holed up in the servant room right after reaching the guesthouse.`
` I sealed him up in the same way.`
` Then, when Rosa‐san returned at {nobr:1 a.m.}, I happened to notice her when I stepped out into the corridor.`
` I let Gohda‐san, who was still in the servant room, know this."`
`"The seal was intact at that time, so from the time we arrived at the guesthouse until {nobr:1 a.m.},`
` Gohda‐san never left the servant room.`
` And afterwards, he was with me in the lounge until {nobr:3 a.m}.`
` And after {nobr:3 a.m.}, I was upstairs,`
` so I can guarantee that Gohda‐san didn't come up."`
`".........Erika's seal proves that Gohda was holed up in the servant room until {nobr:1 a.m}.`
` And Erika can testify to his alibi from then until {nobr:3 a.m.},`
` because she was passing the time in the lounge with him.`
` And after that point, he never set foot upstairs until the morning after.`
` Erika can attest to this as well."`
`"{p:1:In other words, after Gohda returned to the guesthouse, he never went up to the second floor until morning}."`
`"Red truth, valid.`
` ......Well done, Erika.`
` The alibis due to your seals on those doors have been acknowledged by Bern and elevated to the status of red truth."`
`"Thank you very much, my master.`
` ......I am the detective! A being greater than {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, who can invoke the red truth despite her {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}ity!"`
`"You claim to be greater than {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}......?`
` You conceited brat! Live another thousand years, and then you can talk!"`
`"It'll be a pain to have you try anything funny, so I'll make this clear now.`
` In fact, I should have done this in the beginning.`
` I apologize for being so roundabout.`
` This is the state of the guesthouse at midnight."`
`".........The gold had been found, an emergency family conference called, and Battler‐san had gone to the mansion with the relatives.`
` I, the three cousins, Doctor Nanjo, Gohda‐san, and Kumasawa‐san remained in the guesthouse."`
`"I have already explained Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san's alibis.`
` George‐san, Jessica‐san, and Maria‐san were playing cards in the cousins' room.`
` I actually joined in for a little bit, and I clearly witnessed that they were alive at that time."`
`"My master, I request that you repeat this!!"`
`"Yes, I'll oblige you.`
` {p:1:At 24:00 in the guesthouse, George, Jessica, and Maria were alive,`
` and they were in the second‐floor cousins' room.`
` Nanjo, Gohda, and Kumasawa were on the first floor}."`
`"And, since there's no need to hold off on it anymore,`
` I'll confirm that all the victims so far are dead.`
` {p:1:George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, and Genji—these five really are dead}.`
` How could they be playing dead with their necks sliced open like that?"`
`"Thank you for repeating, my master...!`
` I had to make these things clear, you see, or I might have started hearing about how they were already dead before I guaranteed everyone's alibi,`
` or that they weren't actually dead at all."`
`".........gh..."`
`Unsurprisingly, Beato's side couldn't get away with the simple plan of claiming that the victims were only playing dead.`
`But in order to overcome Gohda and Kumasawa's alibis, it should have been possible to suppose that the crime occurred before those doors were sealed.`
`However, the opponent had predicted this move perfectly.`
`It had now been shown in red that the crime did not occur before the time period covered by Erika's alibis.`
`"Got it.`
` That's the last time the victims were confirmed to be alive.`
` I wish you'd said that in the beginning.`
` ......This means we can ignore everything that happened before midnight."`
`".........To go even further,`
` {p:1:at 24:00, Natsuhi, Krauss, and Genji were in a corridor on the second floor of the mansion.`
` All the remaining people were at the family conference in the dining hall.`
` Of course, at that point in time, no murder had occurred.`
` Genji was also alive}."`
`"That isn't something that Erika observed,`
` but we can't move the game forward without establishing it.`
` Okay, I'll acknowledge that red truth."`
`"Thank you very much for that red truth, my master!"`
`Since Erika had been in the guesthouse,`
` it was only natural that she could explain the situation there.`
`However, since she hadn't been in the mansion at the time,`
` explaining the situation over there would have been extremely difficult for her.`
`......Beato would normally have attacked there with the blue truth,`
` saying that the people in the dining hall had all agreed to keep to the same story,`
` and that someone might have snuck out of the dining hall and committed murder in the guesthouse.`
`However, because Bern had instantly settled that matter with the red truth,`
` Beato had completely lost her chance to strike back......`
`"Damn you............"`
`"......Very troublesome.`
` ......To think we would be put at such a disadvantage..."`
`"This is almost the exact opposite of Riiche's fights with Battler......"`
`"......In fact, the situation might be even worse than it was back then."`
`At a glance, the fight between the two of them resembled our previous fights.`
`However, there were some vital differences.`
`The first was whether or not Beato was the Game Master.`
`The Beato who fought against me was the Game Master.`
`{n}So she knew all the truth.`
`That's why she was able to use the red truth at will.`
`However, the current Beato isn't the Game Master.`
`{n}She's just a single piece on the game board.`
`......In other words, even Beato doesn't know the truth.`
`So you could say that Beato is now in the same position I once was.`
`Also, though Erika may seem to be in the same position I once was,`
` the situation for her is totally different.`
`She's connected to the witch called {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`......Even though she isn't the Game Master, she's capable of elevating Erika's statements to become red truth.`
`Because of this, Erika can use the red truth even though she's neither a witch nor the Game Master.`
`Beato, who's supposed to be the witch, possesses no truth or red she can use.`
`{n}And yet the detective, Erika, can use the red truth.`
`The advantage has completely flipped over to the other side.`
`......You could probably say that the current Beato is in a much worse position than I was when I fought with her.`
`After I got used to the game, Beato stopped responding to my repetition requests,`
` but in the beginning, she responded to almost all of them, giving me quite a few hints.`
`That's why we were able to fight on par.`
`However, {f:5:Bernkastel} is different.`
`She fully understands the rules of this game, and is prepared to corner Beato without even a hint of restraint.`
`.........And all this made me realize.`
`......Beato was going easy on me so that we could fight on par with each other......`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*......`
` This has become quite an interesting fight.`
` ...I see, so I must fight from the position Battler once stood in."`
`".........Beato......"`
`"I once insulted you and called you incompetent.`
` ......I can handle much, much worse than this. *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"It's now impossible to suspect Gohda and Kumasawa.`
` You can't win by arguing that point any longer."`
`"Yep.`
` Let's switch to a different approach."`
`"The next in line would probably be Nanjo.`
` He was also in the guesthouse."`
`"Nanjo was in the lounge with Erika, if I'm not mistaken.`
` ......But the time periods before and after that should be wide open."`
`"That's right, I'll strike there.`
` ......Nanjo.`
` You were relaxing in the downstairs lounge of the guesthouse with Erika and Gohda, correct?"`
`"Yes......`
` I was with Erika‐san the whole time..."`
`"And during what time was this?"`
`"F‐from 1 to {nobr:3 a.m}."`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` Between {nobr:1 a.m.} and {nobr:3 a.m},`
` Doctor Nanjo, Gohda‐san, and I were relaxing in the lounge.`
` ......Repetition requested, my master!"`
`"I'll respond.`
` {p:1:From {nobr:1 a.m.} to {nobr:3 a.m.}, the trio of Erika, Nanjo, and Gohda...`
`spent their time in the lounge on the first floor of the guesthouse}."`
`......Though she had flat out refused Beato's repetition request, she responded to Erika's immediately.`
`The red truth...was starting to corner Beato.`
`......Beato grimaced as though in pain, but she still struck back with the blue truth.`
`......No, she really was in pain.`
`As alibis were steadily established for everyone other than Natsuhi, the witch illusion was also being denied.`
`Beato perceived the denial of her existence as pain...`
`"{p:2:Even so, he shouldn't have an alibi for the time period before and after you were in the lounge!`
` It was possible for Nanjo to commit the crime too}!"`
`"That's right.`
` I get that Nanjo was in the lounge with Erika from {nobr:1 a.m.} to {nobr:3 a.m.}, but what about before and after that?`
` ......Well, Erika?"`
`"Of course.`
` First, the alibi for before {nobr:1 a.m}.`
` This is no problem at all.`
` I played cards with the cousins in their room until midnight,`
` and then went downstairs to the lounge, where I met Doctor Nanjo."`
`"That's right......`
` At midnight, I met Erika‐san as she was coming down the stairs, and spoke with her, learning that she was quite the connoisseur of the mystery genre.`
` I realized that I'd found a kindred spirit......"`
`"When I went into the archive to solve the epitaph's riddle,`
` I noticed that there were several original copies of famous foreign mystery novels stored there.`
` So, I wanted to discuss them with the actual books in hand.`
` We moved to the archive and were talking the whole time.`
` Constantly, until we moved to the lounge."`
`The archive in the guesthouse had enough books in it that you might even call it a small library.`
`In it were several famous foreign mystery novels...`
`that Kinzo had once taken a liking to.`
`Of course, they were all originals and in English, but English was no problem for both Erika and Nanjo.`
`On that occasion, Erika had again borrowed the key to the archive from Gohda in the servant room.`
`She added that she had rechecked the seal at that point and, of course, reset it.`
`Damn her.`
`Even though she keeps it sealed for anyone else to enter or leave, she alone enters and leaves whenever she wants.`
`"I see.`
` So, from midnight until {nobr:3 a.m.} when you went to bed, you were with Nanjo the whole time?`
` That means Nanjo's alibi is the most rock solid of them all."`
`"Yes, that is indeed the case!`
` Repetition requested, my master...!"`
`"I'll respond.`
` {p:1:After 24:00, Erika was with Nanjo the whole time until {nobr:3 a.m}}."`
`At midnight, the crime in the cousins' room still hadn't occurred.`
`So this establishes an alibi for the period before the time he spent in the lounge.`
`"After that, we walked out of the archive and into the hallway at {nobr:1 a.m}.`
` When we did, we just happened to bump into Rosa‐san as she returned.`
` I then told Gohda‐san about that.`
` ......I figured it was probably a servant's responsibility to welcome in a guest."`
`Gohda asked if he should bring a towel, but Rosa refused.`
`She quickly headed up to the second floor.`
`At this point, Erika, Gohda, and Nanjo gathered together and decided to have a drink......`
`Their alibis in the lounge up until {nobr:3 a.m.} have already been proclaimed in red, so there are no problems there.`
`"Let's continue on to after {nobr:3 a.m}.`
` This is Doctor Nanjo's alibi after we split up.`
` At {nobr:3 a.m.}, Battler‐san returned and the people in the lounge went their separate ways.`
` Doctor Nanjo, Battler‐san and I went up to the second floor.`
` I then said good night to Doctor Nanjo.`
` At this time, of course, I put a seal on the door to the doctor's room as well."`
`"And it went unchanged until the crime was discovered.`
` I flew out of my room the moment Battler‐san screamed,`
` and I confirmed that the door to Doctor Nanjo's room was still sealed.`
` Therefore, Doctor Nanjo's alibi is perfect both before {nobr:1 a.m.} and after {nobr:3 a.m}...!"`
`"Splendid, Erika.`
` {p:1:Both your seal and your red truth are perfect.`
` Nanjo had the alibi of being with Erika until {nobr:3 a.m}.`
` And he didn't leave his room after {nobr:3 a.m.} until morning}."`
`Using the seals she had placed on the doors,`
` Erika was granted red truths from {f:5:Bernkastel} one after another......`
`When I gave Beato a repetition request, it was about maneuvering and tactics,`
` ......but it's totally different for Erika.`
`For her, it's like having a trump card which can make red whenever she wants......`
`"This concludes the proof of alibis for all suspects in the guesthouse.`
` ......No problems, I assume?"`
`"I, ......I do have a problem...!!`
` And that problem is, ......umm........."`
`Beato racked her brains to find some point to latch onto, but Erika's red had been ruthlessly perfect.`
`......There was no point she could take issue with...`
`Beato kept thinking hard, trying to fault Erika on something,`
` but her expression was so wrought with desperation that anyone could tell by looking...`
`"I'm overruling you, Beato.`
` I can't sense any problems at all.`
` ......It's totally <pop>, <cute>, and <perfect>!`
` The alibis for all humans in the guesthouse have now been proven."`
`"......Hold it, Erika.`
` You're gonna leave me out of this?`
` I'm pretty sure Ushiromiya Battler also had a chance to commit the crime.`
` ......After all, I was in the same room as the victims all night.`
` There's no way I'll let you carry on this discussion while ignoring me.`
` ......?!"`
`At that moment, an arrow twisted like a golden snake and hit me.`
`It didn't pierce through me, but it slapped me hard on the cheek like a whip.`
`"Battler‐sama, your right to speak has not yet been recognized.`
` Be warned."`
`"......Oooww... Dammit......"`
`"Yeah, I understand, Battler.`
` ......And my apologies. Forgive me.`
` ......Erika!`
` You still haven't shown an alibi for Battler!`
` Battler is the man who was sleeping alongside the victims.`
` Shouldn't he be placed under the greatest suspicion of all?!"`
`"Beato's right.`
` You can't go skipping Battler like that."`
`"My apologies.`
` I had completely forgotten about him."`
`"After Battler returned at {nobr:3 a.m.}, you went upstairs with him.`
` And I believe you also went to your own room and slept.`
` You may have gone to the cousins' room at midnight, but I don't think you went there after {nobr:3 a.m}."`
`"......Will you now claim that you went to crawl into Battler's bed later on?`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` Of course, if you tell me you were looking at Battler's sleeping face all night long to confirm his alibi in the cousins' room,`
` I might just be willing to accept your proof...!"`
`"Yes. I listened to him breathing in his sleep all night long. Got a problem with that?"`
`"......What......?!"`
`"I, Furudo Erika, can prove that Battler‐san returned to the cousins' room at {nobr:3 a.m.},`
` that he went straight to bed afterwards, and that he went straight to sleep.`
` And I can prove that until he woke up, noticed the gruesome situation the room was in, and let out a scream, nothing happened in that room."`
`"So you have no need to worry.`
` Battler‐san isn't the culprit.`
` He's just the charming first discoverer who entered the murder scene without realizing it was one and slept until morning."`
`"That's insane...`
` Even with those seals you love so much, it shouldn't be possible for you to prove that...!`
` How can you prove this?!!"`
`".........It's a load of crap.`
` I entered that room alone.`
` And Erika must have gone into her own room as well.`
` How can she say something like that, as though she saw the whole thing...?!"`
`"She never said that she saw it.`
` ......The room Erika was assigned to—where was it located?"`
`"Erika, tell me, please.`
` How can you prove so much about Battler?"`
`".........*giggle*giggle*.`
` I'd expect no less from a true detective......"`
`"My room was right next to the cousins' room.`
` There was only a single thin wall between them."`
`"Y‐`
`......you don't mean......`
` ......You...put your ear against the wall...`
`...to check what was happening in the cousins' room...?"`
`"Yes.`
` My ears are perfect.`
` Right after Battler‐san entered the room, I put my ear against the wall and listened carefully to make sure nothing out of the ordinary occurred."`
`"......You said you could prove that nothing happened until Battler let out a scream the next morning...`
` ......You don't mean..."`
`"Yes.`
` I put my ear against the wall and listened in on that room until morning, without sleeping a wink."`
`...............Everyone...`
`was stunned into silence.........`
`She put her ear against the wall...`
`...and for the entire time until morning...`
`.....she listened to what was going on in Battler's room......`
`Just what would that have looked like......`
`Until dawn, she had silenced her breathing in a pitch‐black room,`
` clinging to the wall shared with the cousins' room......`
`Like some kind of creepy venomous spider clinging to the wall of a darkened room......`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} alone was grinning in triumph.`
`"......Due to the progression of the game, I realized that Battler, the one who had received the Head's Ring, would be a key player.`
` ......I was sure that Battler would be a victim of the first twilight."`
`"Yes.`
` So, just as my master told me to do,`
` ......I put my ear against the wall until morning without a wink of sleep, checking to make sure nothing unusual happened...!"`
`"Erika has a photographic memory.`
` And her hearing ability is on par with a tape recorder.`
` ......It would have been impossible for Battler to kill George and the others and slit their throats without Erika hearing it."`
`"......It's an accepted power of the detective's authority.`
` I have no choice but to acknowledge it.`
` I'll confirm it in red...!`
` {p:1:Ushiromiya Battler returned to the cousins' room at {nobr:3 a.m.} and fell asleep.`
` After that, until the discovery of the crime, absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened in the room}!"`
`"{p:1:In other words, it was impossible for Battler to commit murder or damage the corpses}."`
`".........nn...`
`...ggghh........."`
`The red from the two of them forced Beato to show an expression of considerable anguish...`
`It was only natural.`
`The red truth they had spoken not only guaranteed Battler's alibi, but a number of other things as well.`
`First off, it meant the murder was impossible for {i:anyone} after {nobr:3 a.m}.`
`And since the cousins were confirmed to be alive as late as midnight, the time period of the crime automatically became...`
`“between midnight and three o'clock”.`
`That also automatically provided a guaranteed alibi...`
`for everyone who wasn't in the guesthouse before {nobr:3 a.m.}`
`".........That one hurts...`
`...a lot........."`
`"After midnight, Erika was in the guesthouse the whole time.`
` So, it should have been difficult for her to prove alibis for all of the people in the mansion..."`
`"It should have been almost impossible to prove alibis for Eva and the others.`
` ...But now, all she has to do is prove that they never visited the guesthouse between midnight and {nobr:3 a.m.},`
` and she can prove those alibis..."`
`"......Anyway, we'll have to construct it so that the murders were possible before {nobr:3 a.m}.`
` And we have to prove that it was possible for one of the people in the mansion to do it...!"`
`The people who were in the guesthouse all had alibis.`
`{n}The crime didn't occur before midnight.`
`{n}The crime couldn't have occurred after three o'clock.`
`In other words, there was no way for the murders to happen unless someone from the mansion committed the crime between midnight and three o'clock......`
`In order to protect Natsuhi, she had to establish that it was possible for someone other than Natsuhi to commit the crime.`
`Ironically, the witch had to prove that a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} could have committed the crime...`
`"............Still, that's a tall order.`
` ......Until {nobr:3 a.m.}, Erika was in the lounge.`
` And you have to pass through there to get upstairs.`
` In other words, she's practically like a sentry for the upstairs floor of the guesthouse."`
`"......This is an unimaginative suggestion, but if it was possible to reach the upper floor without Erika noticing,`
` we would probably be able to prove that the crime was possible for anyone."`
`"It's probably possible for a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} to climb up to the second‐story windows if they really wanted to."`
`Of course, Beato had also thought of striking back that way.`
`......And {f:5:Bernkastel} must have thought this as well.`
`"Battler, Nanjo, Gohda, Kumasawa.`
` We realize that the crime was impossible for all these people in the guesthouse.`
` ......However, what about the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s in the mansion?!"`
`"As I have already said, and as my master has even proclaimed with the red truth,`
` I was in the lounge on the first floor of the guesthouse.`
` And to reach the second floor, one must pass through the lounge.`
` In other words, it was impossible to reach the second floor without me seeing it."`
`"And what if that wasn't impossible?`
` {p:2:For example, what if someone placed a ladder against the outer wall of the guesthouse and snuck in through a second‐story window?!`
` There must be a way to reach the second floor without passing through the lounge!`
` If this is the case, it would be possible to reach the crime scene without you seeing it}...!"`
`Beato finally struck back.`
`Before now, she had let Erika take total control and attack her with the red over and over.`
`During that time, Beato's counterattacks with the blue truth had been few in number, even including this one...`
`"Of course, I knew you'd try saying that.`
` I can't have my lookout in the lounge become meaningless.`
` So first, I must prove that my lookout was perfect."`
`"......Firstly, because of how the guesthouse is constructed,`
` it is impossible to reach the second floor without me seeing it from the lounge.`
` There are no places under cover, and neither are there any physical or mental blind spots.`
` ......My master, I request you repeat!"`
`"{p:1:It is impossible for someone to reach the second floor of the guesthouse without anyone in the lounge noticing it.`
` ......Though of course, this only refers to reaching the second floor from inside the building}."`
`"<Good>, my master!`
` ......So, next is Lady {f:5:Beatrice}'s theory that there might be a way to reach the second floor from the outside.`
` This really does pose a problem.`
` After all, there are trees that could probably be climbed, and someone could have used a ladder.`
` We also can't be certain that crawling up the rain gutter would be impossible.`
` But I {i:can't let you do that}."`
`"Hoh, you won't let me...?`
` And how's that?`
` Did you stay up all night circling the guesthouse?`
` No, you couldn't do that, could you?`
` You were in the lounge...!`
` From the lounge, you can only see a small part of the outer perimeter through the window!"`
`"That's true.`
` I couldn't prevent all methods of climbing up to the second floor from the outside.`
` ......However, I was able to prevent all entry from the second floor."`
`"Prevent...entry...?!"`
`"......I had already foreseen this move.`
` ......Frightening......and so persistent...!"`
`"Because of how the guesthouse is constructed, the only method of entry from the second floor is the windows."`
`"The locks? They don't matter at all.`
` I only had to prove that none of the windows or shutters were opened even once."`
`"After I witnessed the location of the hidden gold, I returned to the guesthouse...`
`and immediately began severing all methods of entry to the second floor that didn't pass through the lounge.`
` .........Yes, it's exactly the same.`
` No different from the rest...!"`
`"......Don't tell me...`
`you used that seal of yours......on all the windows of the guesthouse......?`
` In that weather, ......dressed like that...?"`
`"Well, I did have my swimsuit from when I drifted here."`
`".........She's insane......`
` ...At a house where she was welcomed as a guest, before anything had happened at all, she went out in all that rain,`
` and did something like that......?"`
`"For a normal {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, it would certainly be an impossibly dubious action.`
` ......However, she is the witch's piece."`
`In the middle of all that rain,`
` Erika sealed all the windows from the outside...`
`...to create an alibi showing that no one could have snuck into the guesthouse from the outside.`
`She climbed up the walls herself, ......and did that to all the windows on the first and second floor.`
`{n}No, to all things which could possibly have permitted entry.`
`After hearing that she'd listened to the cousins' room all night long without sleeping a wink,`
` even this bizarre behavior didn't seem quite so impossible......`
`That had probably also......looked like a venomous spider.`
`A repulsive venomous spider crawling eerily over the outer walls of the guesthouse in the middle of a storm......`
`".........You...`
` ......Just what do you think...`
`...of the house of Ushiromiya...?`
` Is this how you repay us for welcoming you as a guest...?!"`
`"To the detective, the Ushiromiya house is nothing more or less than the stage upon which the crime occurs.`
` ......Before the outbreak of the crime, it was important for me to memorize the names of the characters, memorize the lay of the land,`
` and prepare for the upcoming crime by devoting my time towards collecting and creating all possible alibis."`
`"From my perspective, detectives who make no preparations before the outbreak of the crime are pretty third‐rate.`
` After all, we all know that someone will die wherever we spend the night."`
`".........Furthermore,`
` at the moment the crime was discovered, Erika confirmed that none of those seals had been broken.`
` That's why Erika wasn't the first one to reach the cousins' room when the corpses were discovered."`
`"Even without inspecting the corpses, she could be certain of several things thanks to the red truth.`
` It was more important to check the seals and construct alibis."`
`"You are perfect, my master.`
` All I did was prove everything to perfection by following your orders...!"`
`"Well done, Erika.`
` My double, my piece...!`
` What do you think, Lambda?`
` I'd say this proves that Erika's lookout in the lounge contains absolute reliability as far as constructing alibis is concerned..."`
`"......Yeah, I'll acknowledge that.`
` Erika, your seal is perfect.`
` I'll acknowledge it in red.`
` {p:1:It was impossible to reach the second floor of the guesthouse without passing through the lounge,`
` and impossible to reach it at all without Erika, who was in the lounge, knowing about it}!"`
`"Thank you very much, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}...!`
` So, you know what's coming next, Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}!`
` {p:2:Therefore, the time of the crime is limited to the single hour between midnight, when they were confirmed to be alive,`
` and {nobr:1 a.m.}, when our party in the lounge started}!"`
`"Ug...`
`...gah...`
`...ah......"`
`"I've already said it, but at midnight, I went down to the lounge,`
` hit it off with Doctor Nanjo, and was engrossed by a discussion of the mystery genre in the archive until {nobr:1 a.m}."`
`"......It's a bit embarrassing, but I grew so engrossed with this discussion...`
`that I wouldn't have noticed if anyone had passed through the corridor during that period.`
` ......Quite a regretful mistake for a detective."`
`After doing all that maneuvering and setting up seals to guarantee a perfect alibi,`
` she became too engrossed in a mystery discussion and left an opening......?`
`Her relaxed smile was completely shameless, the total opposite of her words.`
`It almost seems like it's the other way around.`
`It's enough to make you think that this is an intentional trap,`
` said in full awareness that only Natsuhi doesn't have an alibi for the hour following midnight...`
`"To put it the other way around, this has the following corollary:`
` the only ones who could have reached the cousins' room and committed the crime...are those who have no alibi between midnight and {nobr:1 a.m.}!"`
`Her eyes clearly hinted that Natsuhi was the only one who fit this description...`
`......It had been a crime that occurred at a completely unknown point during that long night.`
`But because of the alibis Erika had constructed,`
` that time period had been compressed and restricted to the single hour following midnight.`
`Erika left the cousins' room at midnight.`
`{n}This is the last time we have confirmation that George and the others were alive.`
`And after the party in the lounge started at {nobr:1 a.m},`
` it was impossible to reach the cousins' room by any method.`
`"............All this from a mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}......"`
`"This is quite bad...`
` The night has been sealed up into an hour, ......and at this rate, there won't be many pieces left to suspect..."`
`"......Damn you, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}...`
` ...Not bad at all........."`
`"Unlike Battler, I'm not an idiot.`
` ......After this game's repeated five times, I have more than enough cards in my hand.`
` ......`
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"Then let us continue.`
` Let's examine the alibis of the remaining suspects, the people in the mansion.`
` After all, we only have to worry about the single hour between midnight and {nobr:1 a.m}.`
` That shouldn't be difficult at all."`
`"First, midnight.`
` At this time, Natsuhi, Krauss, and Genji were in the second floor corridor, and all of the others were in the first floor dining hall.`
` This has already been given in red truth by my master!"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` {p:1:At 24:00, Natsuhi, Krauss, and Genji were in the corridor on the second floor of the mansion.`
` The rest of them were in the dining hall on the first floor}.`
` And as you know, there was a mysterious knock, and a letter with the One‐winged seal on it appeared.`
` The discussion surrounding that continued on until {nobr:1 a.m}.`
` I will say it with the red truth.`
` {p:1:Of all the people in the dining hall, not one of them left the dining hall until {nobr:1 a.m.}}...!"`
`The time that the crime was possible had been limited to between midnight and one o'clock.`
`And it had been guaranteed that the adults in the family conference did not leave the mansion between midnight and one o'clock.`
` This gave them all proven alibis.`
`"......A‐......and how do you intend to prove that?!`
` Erika's in the guesthouse!`
` Did someone prove it by using one of your favorite seals on the dining hall door?!`
` You have no convincing evidence or proof...!!"`
`"{p:1:The red truth is simply truth, and there is no need to provide evidence, proof, or room for a counterargument}!!`
` ......You made that rule.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*giggle*giggle*giggle*ehe{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!!"`
`This overbearing red truth hadn't only given alibis to the adults in the dining hall.`
`It also gave alibis to Shannon and Kanon, who had come to serve tea,`
` and even guaranteed that they never left the dining hall.`
`In other words, ......the only ones who didn't have proven alibis......`
`were three people: Natsuhi, Krauss, and Genji...`
`No, ......there were only two left.`
`If alibis were proven for Krauss and Genji,`
` it would prove that no one but Natsuhi could have been the culprit...!`
`"Let's move on to Genji.`
` He's a victim, but we can't rule out the possibility that he committed the crime in the cousins' room and then was killed himself."`
`"And furthermore, although he was in the second‐floor corridor at midnight,`
` he then returned to the servant room to transfer the phone call for Natsuhi and was completely isolated."`
`"Which means that it was possible for Genji to commit the crime—"`
`"I'll say it in red.`
` {p:1:When Genji finished transferring the call, he immediately returned to the servants' quarters}.`
` That's just a cold, hard truth, without any evidence, proof, seals or alibis, got it?"`
`"Then, at {nobr:1 a.m.},`
` there was another break in the family conference, and Rosa returned to the guesthouse.`
` ......At that time...`
` I'm truly thankful for your cooperation, Ushiromiya Eva‐san.`
` Please rise...!"`
`".........Erika‐chan wasn't the only one, you know?`
` I was also certain that something would happen that night."`
`"She's the person who taught me how to make those seals.`
` And she helped me to check the alibis of those people under suspicion...!"`
`"During the break at {nobr:1 a.m.},`
` I went to Genji‐san's quarters and used the same seal as Erika‐chan...!`
` In other words, if this wasn't broken,`
` it would mean that no one could have entered or left that room between {nobr:1 a.m.} and the next morning...!!"`
`"Now, Kanon‐san and Kumasawa‐san.`
` Please rise."`
`Kanon rose expressionlessly, and Kumasawa got to her feet timidly.`
`"In the morning,`
` you two went to wake Genji‐san because he had slept in, right?`
` And at that time, you noticed that the door was sealed, broke the seal, and opened the door, correct?"`
`"......Y‐...yes.`
` ......I thought it was some kind of prank."`
`"I didn't think deeply about it at the time."`
`"I'm not asking for your opinions. Just give us the facts.`
` Did you break the seal when you entered the room?"`
`""Y‐yes...""`
`"With the red truth, I'll guarantee that Eva, Kanon, and Kumasawa's statements just now are the truth.`
` {p:1:At {nobr:1 a.m.}, Eva sealed Genji's sleeping quarters, and that seal was broken by Kanon and Kumasawa in the morning when the crime was discovered}.`
` Just to save time, I'll add on some more."`
`"{p:1:During the short break at {nobr:1 a.m.}, the first two to leave the dining hall were Rosa and Eva.`
` Until Eva returned, everyone in the dining hall remained there.`
` After seeing Rosa off, Eva went to the sleeping quarters and sealed it.`
` Of course, she did not enter the room at all at this time}."`
`"This is all information I discovered by gathering it from the people involved.`
` These are not baseless red truths.`
` They are truths I arrived at through proper reasoning constructed from testimony.`
` And not only testimony—I took fingerprints and performed every kind of forensic test available to me."`
`"After all, Kinzo‐san's study is a treasure trove of all kinds of chemicals!`
` I obtained all sorts of scientific evidence, which is truth in its purest form and infinitely close to red truth.`
` However, this isn't a science mystery, so I'll spare you the details."`
`As Erika swaggered around the cathedral, she arrogantly touted her scientific knowledge.`
`She had thorough knowledge of all the chemicals in Kinzo's study and had used them to conduct a scientific investigation,`
` which had now been acknowledged and made into red truth by {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`......Without going into too much detail, the results she had obtained would have been convincing even without the red truth.`
`Fingerprint collection with aluminum powder.`
`{n}Composition analysis on the mud under people's shoes. Various chemical reactions from clinging rain water.`
`......Erika had walked in and out of the study that didn't belong to her several times,`
` using all manner of chemicals however she pleased without asking the family's permission.`
`However, no one could fault her for this.`
`{n}The pieces couldn't hinder any action the detective might take for the investigation.`
`{n}That was the power of the detective's authority.`
`"............You act like you own the place...`
` ......From now on, I'll warn everyone I meet never to welcome in any guest who calls themselves a detective."`
`"I believe that would be wise.`
` Giving shelter to a detective is just about the worst omen of misfortune out there."`
`".........This is proof...`
`that it was only possible to reach Genji's sleeping quarters and commit the crime...`
`between midnight and {nobr:1 a.m}, just as with the murders in the guesthouse.`
` And furthermore, Erika's investigation also proved that it was impossible for Genji to reach the cousins' room."`
`It had already been made clear in red truth that, after transferring the phone call to Natsuhi,`
` Genji had gone straight back to the servants' quarters.`
`Now, based on the results of Erika's scientific investigation, they added a further red truth:`
` {p:1:Genji never left the mansion after 24:00}...`
`This made it clear beyond doubt that Genji couldn't have reached the guesthouse,`
` much less the cousins' room......`
`"That leaves......only Krauss and Natsuhi...!`
` All other people have had their alibis proven!!"`
`"......Im...`
`...possible.........`
` ...............—"`
`Natsuhi's mouth flapped open and shut like a goldfish starved of oxygen.`
`And that was an accurate analogy.`
`......Natsuhi's mind was blank and spinning out of control, and she felt as though she really would suffocate.`
`"......Ushiromiya Natsuhi.`
` ......I'll give you one last chance.`
` Confess that all of the crimes were the work of your husband."`
`"D‐......don't be ridiculous!!`
` Do I look like the kind of woman who would falsely accuse her husband?!!"`
`"......Beato.`
` Natsuhi's denied it.`
` I'll give you the same chance.`
` ......You understand, right?`
` ......Please don't tell me...`
`that you expect to be able to take advantage of the fact that Krauss is missing to try and pull a Devil's Proof on me......"`
`".........gah, ghh............"`
`Beato realized that they were rapidly approaching the end of this battle.`
`Normally, these alibis of Erika's would still have many places that Beato could argue against using the blue truth.`
`However, all of those alibis had been accepted by {f:5:Bernkastel} and {f:5:Lambdadelta} as red truth,`
` and Beato no longer had any room to argue......`
`"......It's like.........Erika's creating the plotline,`
` and those witches are distorting things so that everything matches up with it..."`
`"That's right.`
` If the Game Master, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, accepts a truth, its authenticity will not be questioned.`
` The world that comes after will be formed based on the truth that remains in the end.`
` ......This happens no matter how far this final truth is from the real truth."`
`"There's no way Uncle Krauss is the culprit.`
` He's being held prisoner somewhere.`
` ......W‐wait,`
` we can't deny the possibility that Aunt Natsuhi was skillfully tricked into believing that during the phone call......"`
`"Do you suspect Natsuhi and Krauss, Battler‐kun?"`
`"Well............"`
`"Erika's truth has been constructed in a cowardly fashion, but it is a proper truth.`
` She may be colluding with a witch, but it has still been acknowledged as red truth.`
` In other words, it cannot be a fake truth built only on lies."`
`"......This means that even Erika's truth makes sense.`
` The truth about Natsuhi and Krauss being the culprits is also very possible.`
` It may be a hollow truth, but it is {i:consistent}.`
` ......It's a fiction that holds the same worth as truth.`
` ......Which of those two truths will you believe?`
` That is for you to decide."`
`".........No.`
` ......I'll...............trust Aunt Natsuhi...and Uncle Krauss.`
` I realize that they're in some money trouble."`
`"But even so, ......I don't want to believe that they're the culprits.`
` No, I can't believe it...!"`
`"How do you intend to get Natsuhi out of this position, where she's so cornered by red which is slowly but surely closing in on her?"`
`"I, ......I don't know......`
` But I......seriously don't want to give up...!`
` Aunt Natsuhi's been caught in a cowardly trap, that's all.`
` ...And Erika's reasoning is all part of it...!`
` So whether it's intentional or she's being manipulated, Erika is aiding the true culprit."`
`".........Even if Erika {i:has} accused Aunt Natsuhi of being the culprit, ......and even if everyone else here believes that,`
` ......that's exactly why I want to be the one person who trusts her...!"`
`If everyone assumes it's true, does it become the truth?`
`{n}If everyone accepts a lie, does it become the truth?`
`Must the solitary truth‐teller...`
`be dragged to the guillotine to the jeers of liars?`
`"I......don't like it.`
` ......If no one will believe Aunt Natsuhi, then I will...!!"`
`"Real truth isn't something that's determined when everyone thinks something sounds reasonable!`
` It's something you arrive at after thoroughly investigating both possibilities...!`
` So this trial is a downright lie!`
` It's a kangaroo court that exists for no reason other than to set Aunt Natsuhi up as the culprit!!"`
`"......Beato is doing all she can to plead Natsuhi's case, you know."`
`"Wrong.`
` Beato is trying to refute Erika's argument.`
` ......She's just defending!`
` You can't fight in this trial by simply resisting all of your opponent's claims.`
` This is why Beato always cornered me in the past...!"`
`"She isn't going to beat Erika by finding flaws in her reasoning!`
` She has to find a different truth and show {f:5:Lambdadelta}, the ruler of this game...`
`...`
`that her truth is more correct than Erika's...!!"`
`"Without violating any of the red truths that Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} has shown,`
` can you weave together a truth where Natsuhi isn't the culprit......?"`
`"......I, ......I don't know...`
` But, .......as long as I don't believe that Aunt Natsuhi is the culprit, there's got to be a different truth!"`
`"I don't even care if the culprit for the crime ends up being a witch.`
` That's better than having Aunt Natsuhi be framed by an incorrect truth...!!"`
`".........So, no matter how much red truth you are shown,`
` you won't believe that Natsuhi is the culprit, correct?"`
`"Yeah......!`
` For everything, there should always be some people who believe and some who don't...!`
` No matter how much evidence is stacked up against her, someone has to believe that she's innocent!`
` I'm sure there are countless truths in the world that can't be proven with evidence.`
` I don't ever want to accept that something's true just because everyone says it is!!"`
`How can you be sure that there's nothing on the far side of the moon if you've never seen it?!`
`Is there some reason that you have to believe it?!`
`Until you see the far side of the moon with your own eyes,`
` you can't rule out the possibility that nothing is there,`
` and neither can you rule out the possibility of a thriving culture of space bunnies...!`
`You should never assume something is the truth until you actually check it.`
`This court is maliciously trying to force a single interpretation on a truth that can't be checked.`
`I once believed there was a society on the far side of the moon!!`
`But that was in elementary school, and I was made fun of and laughed at.`
` So I thought it was embarrassing to think that a society lives on the moon......`
`...and I threw away that belief.`
`I'd been told by a book my mom read me that rabbits lived on the far side of the moon,`
` and I believed that for a long, long time.`
`......But when everyone said that was wrong,`
` I abandoned that truth without even trying to check it!`
`......Even without evidence,`
` I abandoned the truth I believed in......!`
`And now, everyone is starting to believe that Aunt Natsuhi is the culprit.`
`Even though not a single piece of decisive proof has been shown...!`
`There's no proof, but Erika's words sound reasonable, so they're probably the truth......?`
` {i:That's} your reason to abandon your belief that Aunt Natsuhi is innocent?!`
`"If no one else will believe, ......then I will...!`
` I believe that real truth only surfaces if you look with both eyes, one denying and one affirming...!!`
` No matter how much they try to make Aunt Natsuhi out to be the culprit, it's my belief that she isn't!`
` And I'll never give that up!!"`
`"...............I understand.`
` Then allow me to grant you a single red truth.`
` This is the single bit of power I will give you, now that you hold the will to fight in the truest sense."`
`"Power.........?"`
`"By the name of the Finite Witch {f:5:Virgilia},`
` .........no, as the former witch {f:5:Beatrice}, I grant you this red truth."`
`{a:c:`
`"{p:1:Ushiromiya Natsuhi is not the culprit}!"}`
`"............!!!!"`
`"Plea bargain.`
` ......If you acknowledge that Krauss is the culprit,`
` Erika will cease her pursuit of Natsuhi.`
` From then on, the investigation will proceed assuming that Krauss, whose location is unknown, is the culprit."`
`"What'll you do, Beato?`
` At this rate, Natsuhi's in serious trouble, right?`
` ......Will you accept the plea bargain?`
` If you're willing to abandon this Ushiromiya family honor thing, Bern says she'll let you off with a draw.`
` She's being really soft on you, you know...?"`
`Krauss was currently missing, and it was unknown whether he was alive or dead.`
`{n}Like Kinzo, he was no different than a "cat in a box" that had disappeared into the mists of the island.`
`The cat in the box is a creature of infinite variation; no interpretation of it can be denied.`
`It is the root of endless interpretations.`
` The true source of the Endless Witch's power.`
`In other words, no matter how much {f:5:Bernkastel} were to claim that Krauss was the culprit,`
` ......she wouldn't be able to make that the sole truth.`
`That is, the Krauss culprit theory and the witch theory could exist in almost perfect balance.`
`......Beato could make the game a draw.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} was......tempting her.`
` She was offering her a second chance if she would abandon the honor of the family she'd sworn to protect...`
`and consent to weaving a fragment that would trample all over that honor.`
`There was no room for false confidence.`
` For Beato, to lose was to die.`
`......Unless she could see herself having an overwhelming advantage in this game, the right move had to be to actively pursue a draw.`
`"......Mmg.........ugh........."`
`"I will not allow you to call my husband a killer!!`
` My husband is the next in line to the Ushiromiya family headship!!`
` The one person who will inherit the glory of the Ushiromiya family!`
` I will never allow you to brand him as a criminal...!!"`
`"......Are you sure, Natsuhi......?`
` .........If you refuse to suspect Krauss, ......then...you'll be the only one left.`
` ...Alibis have been proven for everyone else, ......in other words, Hempel's Raven...!`
` Even without any evidence, ...it will be determined that you are the culprit...!"`
`"And so what if I'm the only one left?!`
` I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi!!`
` I will not run or hide!`
` I am innocent!!`
` And I am the representative of the noble head, with the One‐winged Eagle engraved into my heart!!"`
`"If you wish to insult me, go ahead!`
` If you wish to ridicule me, do as you please!!`
` But none of you can damage my honor with fiction!!"`
`With a dignified voice, ......Natsuhi stated her case openly before the witches above her.`
`However, this response of hers...`
`might have been exactly what {f:5:Bernkastel} had intended...`
`"......Natsuhi refuses the deal.`
` .........And you, Beato?`
` ...You understand, right?`
` The instant Natsuhi is singled out, Lambda will deliver her verdict.`
` As soon as that happens, the witch illusion will be denied, and you'll vanish into mist.`
` ......Do you plan to let Natsuhi's foolish stubbornness drag you down to the depths of hell...?"`
`"...............nn............gah........."`
`"......Riiche.`
` You fought well.`
` ......Now's the time to withdraw.`
` Convince Natsuhi and try to work out a compromise...!"`
`"Both Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} and Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} have boredom, not you, as their true enemy.`
` ......I imagine they would like to play this game over again.`
` If they see that you're willing to make a concession, they will most likely accept it gladly...`
`and move on to the next game."`
`"If we move on to the next game, .........then what will happen to the Natsuhi of this game,`
` ......the Natsuhi of this fragment......?"`
`"Now isn't the time to be worrying about that!`
` Natsuhi is just a piece!`
` Even if she gets removed from this game, she'll show up again in the next one!"`
`"But the same does not hold for you, Milady...`
` Through this game, I believe you have learned the moves that Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} has up her sleeves.`
` It's a more realistic goal to make use of that and aim for victory in the next game instead.`
` ......Accepting Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}'s deal might be your one and only good option right now...!"`
`"Throw away that useless pride of yours!!`
` Neither Kasparov nor Deep Blue won every game!`
` The person that wins more games wins in the end, right?!`
` If a witch gets too attached to a single match, a single life, a single piece,`
` ......that witch dies!!"`
`"............My apologies,`
` .........but I cannot do that.`
` .........I know the strength of a man who believed even though everyone said he was wrong,`
` ......and I know the suffering he went through when he was forced to abandon that belief...!"`
`"I will not abandon Natsuhi!`
` Why?`
` Because if everyone else suspects Natsuhi, then someone has to believe in her!`
` Because truth can only be found in the gap between those who doubt and those who believe...!!"`
`"I won't abandon her!`
` Even if everyone believes that Natsuhi is the culprit, I will still claim that a witch is responsible...!!`
` If I can't even make that claim, my existence isn't worth anything...!!"`
`"......I can't afford to lose.`
` "Truth" isn't for anyone to deny."`
`"......It's something that disappears...when you doubt it and abandon it yoursel{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}lf!!"`
`"Is that your answer, Beato......?"`
`"Yeah, of course I refuse!!`
` Ushiromiya Krauss is not the culprit!!"`
`".........Fool.`
` There'll be no coming back from this, you know...`
` Here's what you get for being a quick‐tempered moron.`
` By the name of {f:5:Bernkastel}, Witch of Miracles, I speak with the red truth.`
` {p:1:Ushiromiya Krauss is not the culprit.`
` And he was killed long ago.`
` Shortly after you heard his voice over the phone, in fact}."`
`"N‐.........no.........`
` ...D‐.........darling...............aaah...aaagghhhaaaaaaaaahhhh........."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel}'s cruel and ruthless red blade gouged Natsuhi......`
`......It was......all too merciless.........`
`The lack of knowledge of whether Krauss was alive or dead had almost crushed Natsuhi with anxiety, but she had at least been capable of believing that he was alive...`
`And now, ......that hope...that expectation.......had been crushed......without any chance for a miracle......!!`
`She had thrown herself into this trap out of concern for her husband's safety.`
`With the loss of her daughter and husband.........she had now lost everything she had gained since marrying into the Ushiromiya family.`
`No, ......even after all this,`
` .........one thing still remained.`
`If her husband was lost, .........then right now, she was the last person who could protect the honor of the Ushiromiya family.`
`She still......couldn't let it end here.........`
`Even wrapped up in so much sadness, ......Natsuhi would do all she could to protect that honor...`
`with her last ounce of strength......`
`"Nope, it's all over!`
` It's been determined with the red truth that none of the remaining people in the dining hall left that room until one o'clock.`
` In other words, alibis have already been proven for everyone except Natsuhi!"`
`"......Well done, Erika and {f:5:Bernkastel}!`
` You've fully proven that the crime was impossible for everyone except Ushiromiya Natsuhi!`
` Why don't I start reading aloud from the verdict."`
`"......At midnight on October 4th, 1986, the defendant, Ushiromiya Natsuhi,`
` left before the others while pretending to return to her room to sleep,`
` and murdered George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, and Genji one after another during the one hour period before {nobr:1 a.m.}!"`
`"Let me add something on.`
` Due to circumstantial evidence, include the murder of Krauss."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` In this situation, it's unthinkable that anyone except Natsuhi could kill Krauss!!"`
`"A revision to the verdict!`
` During the hour before {nobr:1 a.m.},`
` Ushiromiya Natsuhi killed Krauss, George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, and Genji one after another!`
` It's only possible for any of these murders to have taken place between midnight and one o'clock!`
` The only person without an alibi during this time was Ushiromiya Natsuhi...!`
` From this point forward, the game will proceed treating the defendant as the true culprit."`
`"Furthermore, because it has been fully proven that the crime was possible for {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s...`
` {f:5:Beatrice}, the Endless Witch...!!`
` This Court of Illusions hereby denies your existence!!"`
`"You have a chance to plead your case. Can you prove an alibi for Natsuhi?`
` Or can you show the possibility of someone other than Natsuhi being responsible?`
` If you can just do that, Natsuhi will stop at being one shade short of absolutely guilty,`
` and the denial of your existence will be put on hold for this game......"`
`If Natsuhi had an alibi, Beato would have shown it long ago.`
`{n}In fact, wasn't the whole point of that trap to make her lose her alibi......?`
`"Even if her alibi is not proven, ......I will believe in Natsuhi's innocence...!!`
` No matter how much you all try to pin your fake truth on her!!`
` I am the true culprit!`
` Natsuhi is innocent!!`
` Even without any proof!!"`
`"......The truth is known only by the master of the night on this island, {f:5:Beatrice} the Golden.`
` I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi!`
` Now that my husband has passed away, I am the head of the Ushiromiya family!!`
` My spirit will not be broken no matter how you try and humiliate me!"`
`"Why, you ask?`
` It is because Father gave me permission to engrave the crest of the One‐winged Eagle into my heart...!!`
` How can your evidence and alibis negate the honor and the crest engraved into my heart?`
` They cannot!!`
` The Ushiromiya crest emblazoned on my heart is immortal!!"`
`.........Now that Natsuhi and {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`had practically been placed on the guillotine,`
` ......they cried out with all the strength of their determination...`
`However, that did nothing except bring a cold smile to the game master {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s face.`
`Erika had constructed a truth that {f:5:Lambdadelta} could accept.`
`......And no one could construct a more convincing truth to deny Erika's.`
`In that case, the most convincing truth would swallow up everything else......and become the one and only "truth".`
`Even if it happened to be different from the real truth.`
`The truth of those in the past is swallowed up by the truth of those in the future.`
`......Even if that truth is a fiction.`
`{n}As long as everyone acknowledges it to be true...!`
`".........You're all bark and bluster.`
` ......I like it best when witches sob and beg for their lives when they're about to be burned at the stake.`
` When they try and act tough like you do, it's such a buzzkill.`
` So I think I'll send you one final gift: a red truth to crush your bluster once and for all."`
`"Wh‐.........what do you mean.........?"`
`"......D‐`
`.........don't, ...Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}...`
` ......Isn't it already going to be overwritten with the truth you desired......?`
` Your truth and Natsuhi's should be able to coexist...`
` Please don't defile it......`
` .........Please............"`
`"{p:1:Natsuhi.`
` When did Kinzo ever say it was okay for you to engrave the One‐winged Eagle into your heart?`
` Those were just the words of the Kinzo from your delusions.`
` ......The real Kinzo?`
` Throughout his entire life, not {i:once}...`
`did he ever trust you from the bottom of his heart,`
` and not once did he ever consider letting you bear the family crest}!"`
`When that heartless announcement was made.........Kinzo stood up.`
`"Natsuhi!! You need not listen to this!!`
` No one can defile the crest engraved in your heart!!`
` That is yours alone!!`
` Do not ever forget your pride as the final head of the Ushiromiya family!`

`......Although it doesn't deserve repeating,`

`"......Uu, ......uwaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahh......!!`
` Aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ahhhhhh!!"`
`Natsuhi's cry,`
` a mixture of sadness and many other emotions,`
` echoed throughout the cathedral......`
`......Natsuhi could no longer stop her tears.`
`Some last, faint element that had cheered her up until today,`
` that had allowed her to endure as an Ushiromiya, as the wife to the head's representative, ......and as the final family head...`
`......had been torn to bits......`
`Natsuhi no longer...`
`...had anything left.`
`Natsuhi could no longer allow herself to even call herself an Ushiromiya.........`
`The difficult days, the painful days.`
`The days where she still gave everything she could for the family she'd married into despite it all.`
`......The rare happy days that existed among them.`
`All of these flitted through her mind, one after another...`
`......and disappeared.`
`All of those once beautiful memories,`
` ......now crushed by {f:5:Bernkastel}'s red truth,`
` .........smashed into tiny shards that scattered everywhere,`
` ...buried themselves deep into her hands,`
` ......and soaked them red with the blood of sorrow...`
`.........It was...`
`the red of sadness...`
`and truth.`
`"That is all.`
` ......All it takes is the presence of this crime,`
` and a deduction like this becomes trivial for Furudo Erika.`
` ......Your thoughts, ladies and gentlemen...?"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta}...clapped.`
`Then, a little later than expected, {f:5:Bernkastel} began to clap as well, looking satisfied.`
`The expressionless, wax‐figure‐like audience followed suit,`
` and the unshakable verdict was welcomed with great applause.........`
`And so, .........the "truth" of this tale...`
`was decided.........`
`Right now, no humans exist on this island except for those in this parlor.`
`And with one exception, it has been shown that none of them have committed murder.`
`And, the culprit is among these people.`
`"......Whoa, whoa.`
` ...In that case, ...it's conclusive, isn't it...?"`
`"Unless the culprit is a witch who committed murder with magic, that is..."`
`"............It was you?!`
` You killed George, killed my husband?!`
` Why?!!`
` Whyy{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}yyy?!!"`
`"I, ...I didn't kill anyone...!`
` I, I, d‐didn't do...!!"`
`"....................."`
`In a panic, and with a voice that really couldn't be called flowing,`
` ......in a manner that was, to put it coldly, unsightly...Aunt Natsuhi denied the suspicion placed upon her...`
`However, ......there was no longer any way around it...`
`{i:The girl} stood up, ...brushed back her long hair, pointed at Aunt Natsuhi, and said it one more time.`
`"......You are the culprit.`
` Ushiromiya Natsuhi‐san."`
`Red‐faced and tear‐streaked,`
` ......Eva walked up to Natsuhi...`
`...and grabbed her by the collar.`
`Then, wordlessly, she slapped Natsuhi's cheek.`
`Natsuhi, who had never been slapped in her life,`
` was shocked by her first ever taste of iron.`
`It turned into a scuffle between Eva and Natsuhi.`
`Battler immediately tried to stop them,`
` but Eva planted a sharp knee into Battler's gut and he doubled over.`
`"Give them back, give back George and my husband!!`
` Why did you kill them?!`
` You murderer, murdereeeeeeeer!!"`
`Sobbing, Eva kicked Natsuhi, who had fallen to the ground, over and over.`
`Battler tried once more to cut in and stop them, but he was brushed aside,`
` ......and after that, no one tried to stop them.`
`Repeating her son and husband's names over and over, Eva kicked Natsuhi.`
` And kicked her.`
`Then she started grabbing whatever her eyes fell upon and throwing it.`
`......Natsuhi was hit with a steaming teacup,`
` ...then a can of black tea, whose tea leaves fell out all over her.`
`She was kicked, her hair pulled and dragged up,`
` her cheek slapped so many times that it started to swell.`
`No one tried to stop it.`
`{n}It wasn't because they were worried about Eva kicking them too.`
`It was because they thought it an appropriate act of retribution for a person who had lost her beloved son and husband.`
`A proper...retribution.`
` A proper...truth.`
`Everyone in the parlor accepted that Natsuhi was the culprit.`
` ......They accepted the truth that Erika claimed.`
`So it became a proper truth, and Natsuhi was designated as the proper culprit.`
`She had already lost the husband and daughter who would have protected her,`
` ......and even Kinzo, who should have given her a final bit of strength, had already vanished like a bubble in the ocean of illusions......`
`No longer...would anyone protect her.`
` No longer...would anyone believe her. So she was now...the true culprit.`
`Eva's shoulders heaved with her heavy breathing.`
`{n}......Apparently, her anger still hadn't abated.`
`Erika patted Eva's shoulder and made her take a step back.`
`......Of course, this wasn't to protect Natsuhi from violence.`
`It was to further humiliate her, ......now that she had been branded as the culprit.`
`"Natsuhi‐san.`
` I've solved two of the three riddles.`
` The whodunit.`
` The howdunit.`
` The final riddle—the whydunit—must always be confessed by the culprit herself.`
` Please follow the rules of the mystery genre and confess."`
`The whydunit......refers to the motive.`
`"If this was a third‐rate mystery,`
` ......you would let out a high‐pitched laugh about now, confess to the crime,`
` and start telling the story of your sad past.`
` ......Don't tell me you intend to make me explain that part as well?"`
`"......I am not the culprit!!`
` Someone, believe me!!`
` I had my husband taken hostage, and I was blackmailed......I was framed...!!"`
`Natsuhi, with her hair a mess and her face red and tear‐streaked,`
` ......protested to everyone,`
` .........but no one met her gaze.`
`Because it had already been resolved that Natsuhi was the culprit.`
`Because {f:5:Lambdadelta} had acknowledged that the culprit of the tale was Natsuhi and woven it that way,`
` none of the pieces would pay any heed to Natsuhi's......to "the culprit's" words...`
`"Natsuhi isn't the culprit!!`
` I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` I am the one who commands Rokkenjima's night and who has reigned since long before the time you were all still scared of the dark!"`
`"Why can't you just call it my sin? Why must you suspect Natsuhi?!!`
` Acknowledge me!!`
` I committed all the crimes!!`
` It cannot be the work of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}! It cannot beee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}ee!!"`
`The witch illusion had already been crushed, ......and Beato's voice didn't reach anyone.`
`The verdict had already been announced.`
` ......Everything had been decided.`
`"No one can hear you.`
` You're a phantom, a mere illusion!`
` Go back to being a simple portrait!`
` You're a frail illusion of a witch, born when the relatives shared in Kinzo's fantasy!!`
` That is the truth chosen by this world!!"`
`"So, Great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}!!`
` Now is the time for you to bury this presumptuous and foolish illusion that calls itself a witch...!!"`
`"Goodbye, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` .........I made you a witch hoping that you would either become my friend,`
` or help distract me from my boredom.`
` And you've answered my expectations.`
` The second one, that is.`
` ...Eheheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh!!"`
`"......I...`
`...am a witch......`
` Even if you don't acknowledge it, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}...`
` ......I am a witch........."`
`"You wouldn't even have been capable of believing that if I hadn't become your guardian in the first place...!!`
` Okay, it's game over for you now.`
` I'll bury you in accordance with the rules of your game board.`
` ......What happens to the losers in your game, again...?"`
`"Beato has already shown that clearly in a previous game.`
` You get tossed into the goats' dinner party as a lump of living flesh and are chewed to bits."`
`"Now there's a fitting end for you, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` And I did come all the way here just to hear the death cries of one as haughty as you...!!"`
`One by one, a massive number of unspeaking goat attendants`
` slipped out from behind pillars and began to fill the cathedral.`
`The goats paid no attention to Natsuhi, who was seated in the center,`
` but the crowd completely enveloped her.`
`From Beato's point of view up on the balcony,`
` ......it must have looked like a huge boiling pot of goats.`
`"...............Heh,`
` ......*cackle*,`
` ...haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!`
` That's right,`
` ......this was our contract from the beginning...!"`
`"Yep.`
` Our contract said that whenever you stopped entertaining me,`
` you would relieve me of my boredom with your life!"`
`"Come, strip the title of witch from this woman and throw her into the pot of goats!!"`
`Suddenly, there were goats standing right behind Beato.`
`......They lifted her up roughly.`
`"Let me hear some nice screams.`
` You're a bottle of wine we've been saving for this day."`
`"......Then remaining silent will be my final strike back at you..."`
`"Yes! I made her say it!`
` Uhihihahaaah!!`
` The screams of those who gift me that line as their parting shot are the most gratifying of all!`
` ......Now fall!`
` {f:5:Beatricee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeee}......!!!"`
`The goats carrying Beato no longer viewed her as their master.`
`After holding her above the pot of clambering goats,`
` which were snorting heavily in anticipation......`
`...they threw Beato's slender body into the air.`
`All at once, the squirming goats faced the heavens and raised their arms.`
`It was almost as though...`
`devouring her flesh would allow them to forget their pain for just a short while.`
`As she flew through the air, Beato tried to smile boldly,`
` ......but it was so forced that it seemed even more pathetic,`
` greatly pleasing {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`When Beato fell into the pot, the goats caught her.`
`Of course, they didn't do it gently.`
`The arms of countless goats pulled at her flesh to keep it for themselves.`
`They tried to tear her to bits.`
`It didn't have to be flesh.`
`{n}Hair, fingernails, shoes, even bits of her dress worked just fine.`
`The mouths of those goats were the gateway into hell.`
`However, Beato was too big to pass through that gateway.`
`So they had to chew and tear her...`
`into bits small enough to fit into it...!`
`.........Beato let out a bold laugh.`
`{n}She laughed from inside the pot of goats.`
`However, her expression was very different from the one she had intended.`
` .........It was an expression not of a witch, ......but of a single {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} screaming out for the final time.`
`Then, the sea of goats parted.`
`Dlanor leapt forward, slicing all the goats in her path with a single flash of her longsword.`
`......It was a thin slice, like cutting through butter.`
`The goats were surprised by Dlanor's sudden appearance and stepped back.`
`In the center, {f:5:Beatrice} cowered in tatters,`
` ......sobbing......`
`"What's the meaning of this?`
` Inquisitor Dlanor."`
`"My apologies, but I have something to {f:5:say}.`
` There is someone who has an objection to this {f:5:verdict}.`
` His name is...`
`Ushiromiya Battler."`
`All of the goats stared at Battler.`
`"What do you find unsatisfactory about the court's {f:5:decision}...?`
` ......I assume you possess new evidence or truth sufficient to request a {f:5:retrial}...?"`
`"........................gah......"`
`I get it.`
` ......Dlanor is offering me a helping hand.`
`If she hadn't jumped in here, it'd all be over.`
`And I fully understand now how I'm supposed to fight.`
`But it's that very understanding......that makes me unable to fight.`
`Because I know I can't win by simply countering Erika's truth.`
`If I want to deny her truth, I'll need to present a different one.`
`...And I still don't have a clue what that truth is......!`
`"There is nothing that time cannot {f:5:heal}.`
` And there is no truth that cannot be reached if you spend enough time {f:5:searching}.`
` ......However, all courts place time limits upon determining the {f:5:truth}.`
` And a truth that cannot be reached within that time limit cannot become {f:5:truth}."`
`......Yeah, ...I know that......!!`
`{n}By now, everyone is certain that Aunt Natsuhi is the culprit.`
`{n}It might be too late now, ......even for the real truth...!`
`Aunt Eva's violence will probably go unstopped,`
` and no one is even thinking about protecting Aunt Natsuhi.`
`It's no longer a situation where we can say "oh, the truth will eventually be found".`
`And in this world, ......even the time allotted to us to expose the truth...is very short.`
`It's already midnight and the end of the game.`
`The police won't come.`
` The truth won't be revealed!`
`Only the truth decided upon here and now will remain...!`
`"..........................."`
`I slowly stood up,`
` ......walked in front of Beato,`
` ......and faced Dlanor.`
`.........I have no plan.`
` I don't know the truth.`
`......However, ......if I don't jump in now, I won't get another chance to fight...`
`The red used by Erika's group is mercilessly strict.`
`I seriously doubt that I can put together a truth where Aunt Natsuhi isn't the culprit without violating that red......`
`"......Why the uncertain {f:5:face}?`
` How {f:5:pathetic}."`
`"D‐.........dammit........."`
`"......B‐......Battler......"`
`"I'll be the one to kill you.`
` ...I want to keep that promise.`
` ......And yet,`
` ......right now,`
` ......I don't have any plan at all......"`
`"............That's okay...`
` In this world,`
` ......there is no truth.`
` ......The truth is made later on and overwrites what comes before it.`
` Real truth...`
`...doesn't exist anywhere......"`
`"This is a wonderful turn of events, Dlanor.`
` Yes, the execution of a princess would be no fun at all without a knight appearing to rescue her.`
` ......And there could be nothing better than having him beheaded before her very eyes!`
` Bury the old piece and the unneeded player together!!"`
`"As you {f:5:wish}.`
` Glory be to the great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}!`
` I am the Chief {f:5:Inquisitor}, Dlanor {nobr:A. Knox}...!!`
` Step {f:5:forward}, Ushiromiya Battler!!"`
`"D‐......dammit, I've got nothing more to lose...`
` If you wanna see me struggle, here you gooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooo!!"`
`The only reason Erika's theory is so strong is because of those seals.`
`She was given red so quickly just because {f:5:Lambdadelta} easily bought the alibis created by those seals.`
`But the seals aren't red truth!`
`{n}Just sticking paper in a door crack is far from perfect.`
`There's no way something like that can prove anything with "certainty"...!`
`"Begin, Battler!!`
` Ready to let those goats turn you into a pile of meat along with your beloved {f:5:Beatrice}?!"`
`"Oh, and I'll mix the leftovers from your precious sister into that pile.`
` Wouldn't that make for a wonderful stack of meat?`
` ......Then we can wrap it up in a dumpling, steam it and maybe add some soy sauce!!"`
`"No, the best way would be to fry them in a pan with some eggs and ketchup!!"`
`""Ahyahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hhhya{0}hhya{0}hya{0}yhya{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaahhhh!!""`
`"D‐dammiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittt!!"`
`"{p:2:Can't we doubt the reliability of these seals of Erika's?!`
` Something like wedging some paper in a door can't create a perfect alibi!`
` It might be that someone noticed by chance and happened to put it back in the same place}...!!"`
`The blade of my blue truth should have slashed diagonally through Dlanor's chest.`
`...However, Dlanor's expression didn't budge in the slightest, and there wasn't a single wound on her chest.`
`"I was wondering what you'd throw out there, but this is ridiculous..."`
`"......Allow me to explain.`
` This is what I sealed the doors with.`
` ......Did you think this was paper, Battler‐san?"`
`Erika once again held up the thing that looked like brown paper.`
`"This is duct tape.`
` Its adhesive power is extremely strong.`
` ......I scored it with scissors to make sure it tore easily."`
`"Furthermore, across the center seam and the edges affixed to the door and the frame...`
`I wrote my signature, which is impossible to reproduce.`
` Therefore, it's impossible to tear it off without leaving a mark, and it's impossible to reattach too...!"`
`"Applying to unsheathe the Red {f:5:Key}."`
`"Granted."`
`"{p:1:Due to the above, the seals are guaranteed to be {f:5:perfect}.`
` Miss Erika's seals were not broken by anyone, and deception is {f:5:impossible}}!!"`
`"{p:2:I'll acknowledge Erika's seals...!`
` However, Auntie Eva's seal on Genji‐san's room should be different}!!"`
`"{p:1:Eva's seal was of the same type as Miss Erika's.`
` That is because this method of sealing was one that Miss Erika and Eva conceived of together after {f:5:dinner}}."`
`"{p:2:Erika fished through the chemicals in Grandfather's room saying she'd use them for forensic testing, right?!`
` There might have been some kind of solvent among them!!`
` If you used that, you might be able to tear off the duct tape without leaving fingernail marks}!!"`
`"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.`
` {p:1:It is impossible to tear off any of the seals by any method without leaving marks}."`
`"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.`
` {p:1:There were no suspicious marks on any of the seals}...!"`
`"This proves that there was no tampering done to any of the seals.`
` Repetition requested!!"`
`"Yes, gladly.`
` {p:1:All of Erika and Eva's seals...`
`were not tampered with in any way that hindered their ability to act as seals, such as being scraped off}."`
`"......Dammiiiiiiit...`
` damn you, sticking duct tape all over the place that leaves marks on whatever it touches......!"`
`Dlanor isn't my only enemy.`
`{n}There's also her subordinates, Gertrude and Cornelia.`
`{n}And also Erika and her master {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`{n}And even {f:5:Lambdadelta}, the one who hijacked Beato's game!`
`Everyone in this cathedral is an enemy.`
`That fierce rush of red immediately repelled my feeble truth.`
`......It's obvious why. I don't have any alternate truth.`
`{n}Even at this final stage, ......I have nothing...`
`"Were the seals all that you had to {f:5:discuss}?`
` You promised to give me everything you {f:5:have}."`
`"..................kh........."`
`If I only knew a truth that could prove Aunt Natsuhi's innocence...`
`{n}If I could only make a theory that weaves its way through Erika's red......`
`......Dammit, I don't know anything!!`
`".........Do you have any chance of winning...?"`
`"......I left it at home.`
` Mind if I go back and get it?"`
`"I have already lost.`
` ......I am prepared for my fate."`
`"......I promised that I'd kill you.`
` So I won't let anyone else do it.`
` I never break a promise...!!"`
`"That's a lie.`
` ......I will never trust one of your promises again."`
`"Huh?`
` When did I ever make a promise to you and lie about it...?"`
`"............Heheheh, ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` ......After hearing you say that, hell might not be so bad.`
` ......Eha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha, gaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!!`
` Kill us! {f:5:Bernkastel}, {f:5:Lambdadelta}...!!`
` Hyahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"`
`Beato let out a shrill cry, overcome with laughter.`
`{n}......It was a broken laugh, and tears streamed down her cheeks.`
`Battler's words would no longer reach her ears.`
`She kept on laughing insanely, like a broken record......`
`"Is it {f:5:over}?`
` {f:5:Pitiful}.`
` I truly am {f:5:disappointed}, Ushiromiya Battler...!!"`
`"Hyah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha, hiihha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}hya{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahh!!`

`Their red truth is getting more and more perfect......`
`Each time I think I can slip through a chink in their armor,`
` Dlanor smacks me down with the red longsword of Knox......`
`"......Hihihiha,`
` hiihii,`
` ......haha, haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha......"`
`"............Beato......"`
`"That's enough, Battlerr...`
` ......This will at last be...`
`the end of the eternal torture that torments me—no, us.`
` ......Let us fall together into the depths..."`
`"........................gah..."`
`I don't...`
`want to see Beato like this......`
`Her majesty as the ruler of the Golden Land...`
`...and her enthusiasm as my adversary...`
`...are completely gone.`
`She's just a pitiful woman who's been trampled over and who has lost all hope,`
` with tears streaming down her face and a tragic smile that I can't bear to look at......`
`"Does your truth no longer {f:5:exist}?"`
`No,`
` ......I have one...`
`...last thing.`
`"......And that is a different truth, where Natsuhi is not the {f:5:culprit}?"`
`......No.`
` All I can do is prove that Aunt Natsuhi isn't the culprit.`
`I can't show...`
`...what the real truth beyond that...`
`...is at all......`
`"......But even so, ......maybe at least you'll be saved that way."`
`"Why.........?"`
`"......I can show without a doubt that Aunt Natsuhi isn't the culprit.`
` ...But I cannot present a different truth.`
` ......If Erika's truth is dispersed, the crime will return to darkness, and there might still be room for you to exist."`
`"Assuming you can pull it off.`
` .........But if you can't present a new truth, that means you're incompetent and useless as a player.`
` I'll have you vanish from this game board for all eternity."`
`At this point, the Game Master is {f:5:Lambdadelta},`
` ......and she's there too.`
`This probably doesn't mean defeat in a single game,`
` but being banished from this game for all eternity as the loser.`
`From what the witches have said in the past,`
` I can faintly imagine the place "pieces" are sent when they're banished.`
`It's known as the depths of oblivion,`
` ......an eternal darkness that lies on the far side of an eternal oblivion and where there is no concept of life or death...`
`......I'm...going to disappear.`
` But still, ......Beato will remain.`
`As long as Beato remains, no matter how suspicious Aunt Natsuhi is,`
` ......there will always remain space for the witch to be the culprit...in other words, room for Aunt Natsuhi to not be the culprit.`
`......As long as that wiggle room is there, ......someone will eventually expose the truth.`
`It doesn't have to be me.`
`Eventually, ......someone, at least, will smash this fake truth to pieces......!`
`I understood that this...`
`...was the time to abandon myself for the sake of this other person who would eventually appear,`
` ......for the sake of the real truth......`
`"......Well,`
` ......it looks like I'll have to break my promise to kill you after all."`
`"Don't.`
` Don't leave me as the only one alive.`
` I'll disappear with you.`
` Let that be your final tribute to me.`
` ......I beg you, if you just grant this one wish, I won't need anything else......"`
`".........Have you said your last {f:5:goodbyes}?`
` ......I really am disappointed in {f:5:you}, Ushiromiya Battler."`
`"Hurry up and put him out of his misery.`
` We still have to get to my monologue exposing Natsuhi‐san's crimes."`
`"You guys really are interesting.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Ushiromiya Battler."`
`"......But I've gotten tired of you.`
` You aren't needed in {i:our game}.`
` .........`
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*,`
` ehe{0}he{0}he{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahah!!`
` Do it, Dlanor!!"`
`"This is the {f:5:end}.`
` ......If you still have one last bit of power,`
` let me see you muster it now, in your last {f:5:moments}...!"`
`"Nn.........`
`......nnnggaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aagghhhhh!!!"`
`It's a small but brilliant red truth.`
`{n}My last trump card, courtesy of {f:5:Virgilia}...!!`
`Erika......this takes your theory back to square one...!!`
`"Go for it...if you think you can."`
`{a:c:`
`Take thiiiiiiiiiiis}!!!`
`"{p:1:Ushiromiya Natsuhi is not the culprit}!!!"`
`The red truth is simply truth, with no evidence or proof required.........!!`
`This will make Dlanor stagger...!!`
`Even if that's all it does,`
` ......it's the first and last strike I can make...!!`
`"{p:1:Knox's 2nd:`
` It is forbidden for supernatural agencies to be employed as a detective {f:5:technique}}."`
`...............Huh......?`
` My...`
`...red truth...`
`......was blown away by Dlanor's red longsword......`
`"......In this court, if anyone other than witches is going to speak the red truth,`
` they'll have to construct an appropriate proof for it.`
` Erika has been following this protocol, why can't you...?"`
`True, Erika herself hasn't used the red even once so far.`
`......She's always had the witch {f:5:Bernkastel} make those statements by using repetition requests......`
`"Your red truth isn't something you obtained for yourself.`
` ......It's a supernatural truth gifted to you by a paranormal entity.`
` In other words, it isn't reasoning.`
` It's no better than a random thought......"`
`I‐`
`......in that case,`
` ......if I have {f:5:Virgilia}...`
`...say the same red truth......`
`Where is......{f:5:Virgilia}.........?`
`"If you are to present that red truth, you must construct an appropriate {f:5:argument}.`
` ............Can you do {f:5:that}......?"`
`No, .........it's impossible............`
`I just have the truth that Aunt Natsuhi isn't the culprit...`
`.........without any basis or evidence.`
`".........See......?`
` ......Real truth......is a very fragile thing.`
` ......Does real truth exist...?`
` And is it necessary......?`
` ......Even without it, ......the story goes on......`
` ......Battleeer........."`
`"Now, Battler.`
` ......Prove the red you have {f:5:shown}.`
` ......If you cannot, this is {f:5:goodbye}."`
`"............Then...`
`...this is goodbye.`
` ......Sorry,`
` Beato."`
`"......Don't say that.`
` Thanks for sticking around with me.`
` ......It was such a blood‐stained tale...`
`......but it was fun..."`

` <Great equalizer is the DEATH>}!!"`
`Then, the trial for the fifth game was over.`
`{n}The detective, Furudo Erika, accused the culprit, Ushiromiya Natsuhi.`
`There are three riddles that the detective must explain.`
`The first is the whodunit.`
` Who is the culprit?`
`As previously stated, it is Ushiromiya Natsuhi.`
`The second is the howdunit.`
` How did they carry out the crime?`
`During the hour between midnight on October 4th, 1986 and {nobr:1 a.m.} the next day,`
` Ushiromiya Natsuhi went to the cousins' room on the second floor of the guesthouse and the servants' quarters on the first floor of the mansion.`
` There, she carried out the murders.`
`It is only possible for the crime to have taken place during that hour,`
` and for that one hour, alibis have been proven for all characters except Natsuhi.`
`From the sky, a massive, red longsword, even greater in size than the one Dlanor held, came crashing down like a thunderbolt,`
` and pierced through Battler's heart, pinning him in place while he still stood......`
`In that instant, {f:5:Beatrice} vanished in a spray of gold,`
` ......and her former minions disappeared as well.`
`As the heartless witches looked down at the cathedral's center, laughing coldly,`
` ......all that remained was Battler, with the red longsword sticking through him, and Dlanor.`
`"Agh.........nng...`
`...............gghh........."`
`"......Rest in {f:5:peace}, Ushiromiya Battler.`
` It is a {f:5:shame}.`
` I thought you were a more capable person than {f:5:this}."`
`"...............guh........................"`
`Battler blew bubbles of blood,`
` ......closed his eyes slowly,`
` ............and expired......`
`Dlanor stared on in silence,`
` ......then turned on her heels when she saw his life leave him.`
`After that, all that remained was the corpse of this sorrowful man, pierced by the sword that acted as a massive, red grave marker,`
` and lit by the faint glow let in from the cathedral's skylight.........`
`And then, there is the third riddle that the detective must uncover.`
`The final riddle...the whydunit.`
`{n}Why did they commit the crime—`
`the motive.`
`In third‐rate mysteries, there's no need to uncover this.`
`After all, even if you don't expose the motive, the culprit will just confess it when all's said and done.`
`However, Furudo Erika was first‐rate, so she would expose even this.`
`Natsuhi was confined in the parlor, under everyone's watchful gaze.`
`Then, with everyone's assent,`
` Erika diligently and persistently searched all places, even Natsuhi's room, for clues about her motive.`
`"Well, now that we have all gathered,`
` just what is it that drove Ushiromiya Natsuhi‐san to commit these terrible murders?`
` Through my investigation, I, the detective Furudo Erika, have discovered the general outline that explains this.`
` I would like to announce it now."`
`Everyone remained silent, urging her to continue......`
`Erika tossed some of Natsuhi's possessions that had been "confiscated" onto the table...`
`"First, these are past diaries that were discovered in Natsuhi‐san's room.`
` They have barely been used at all in recent years,`
` but they describe in detail the period shortly after she became a part of the Ushiromiya family."`
`"Most of them were locked, but in order to find the full truth behind this crime,`
` I used my authority, which everyone has acknowledged,`
` to destroy the locks on all of them."`
`"......Y‐`
`......you monster......`
` ......Reading...`
`...another person's diary......"`
`"If we're monsters, what does that make you, murderer?!!`
` A criminal like you has no right to privacy!!"`
`"And this is what I found from these diaries.`
` Natsuhi‐san ended up married to Krauss‐san due to special circumstances."`
`"......I imagine that all of you here know much more about this than I do.`
` Natsuhi‐san and Krauss‐san were not married because of love or as a normal arranged marriage.`
` ......If anything, it was more like taking a hostage."`
`"Th‐......that is not true!!"`
`"This is written on the 24th page of this red diary:`
` .........‘I am a hostage being imprisoned by the Ushiromiya family under the guise of marriage.`
` However, if everything can be resolved this way......’"`
`"Natsuhi‐san.`
` Right here, you've already admitted that you were a hostage.`
` ......Kumasawa‐san, you have served Natsuhi‐san since the time she first came here, right?`
` Could you tell me about what it was like at the time?"`
`".........Y‐......yes, that's correct.`
` ...I did catch wind of something similar to what you describe...`
` ......I think that by now, the only ones who would know the details of Madam's marriage...`
`...are Doctor Nanjo and myself..."`
`"Very true......`
` ......That was during Kinzo‐san's golden era, when he did whatever he pleased...`
` He defeated all of his enemies and expanded his financial power.`
` ......Natsuhi‐san's family was one of those enemies."`
`As though the time to talk had suddenly come at hand,`
` Kumasawa and Nanjo openly delved into territory that should never have been touched upon again......`
`It concerned the period during which Kinzo was most feared for his ferocity.`
`Although he was financially very powerful and had many connections,`
` the elite looked down upon him as an upstart, which gave him a complex about his social standing.`
`To combat this, Kinzo wanted to find Krauss a wife from a noble family...`
`and use this to raise the Ushiromiya family's status...`
`He waged a financial war against Natsuhi's family, beat them down, ......and then proposed that a marriage be performed as a method of reconciliation.`
`And the person he picked......was Natsuhi.`
`She was a veritable princess, raised good and true by a family of Shinto priests.`
`By choosing her, not only did Kinzo cause them the worst possible humiliation,`
` he also won what he considered to be the greatest possible trophy.`
`So that marriage proposal was humiliating to Natsuhi from the very beginning......`
`"Regarding the events of this period, both Kumasawa‐san and Doctor Nanjo's claims just now...`
`match with the contents of the diaries."`
`"Therefore, since the time Natsuhi‐san first took the name Ushiromiya Natsuhi,`
` she has held a strong animosity towards the Ushiromiya family.`
` ......What do you have to say, Natsuhi‐san?`
` Do you admit this?"`
`All of the cold gazes turned to face Natsuhi...`
`"I‐......it's true that I thought that at first......`
` I thought I was being forced into a marriage without love, ...a hostage under the guise of a bride......"`
`"However, ......my husband......never viewed me as a mere hostage......`
` ...He understood what I had gone through and gave me compassion and affection......`
` My husband......was the only person who could understand me...!"`
`"......I see.`
` That makes sense.`
` There are indeed a number of places in your diaries illustrating that Krauss‐san knew of your difficulties...`
`and showed concern for you."`
`"However, on page 47 of this diary here,`
` you describe these moments as being unpleasant, correct?"`
`"Let me read aloud.`
` ‘When Krauss tries to show consideration, it only makes me feel more wretched.`
` Sometimes, I think he might even be trying to humiliate me further.’`
` ......From this, we can tell that Natsuhi‐san was repulsed by her husband and the concern he showed."`
`"W‐......wait...!`
` Yes, I may have thought that at the beginning...!`
` Back when I lived every day in fear for my future, I couldn't accept his concern as true...`
`and yes, I may have written of my distrust from time to time...!`
` But I eventually realized he was sincere and grew to accept his feelings...!"`
`"Well, nothing like that appears in any of these diaries."`
`"I, ......I never even wrote it down,`
` those feelings were so secret...!"`
`"Multiple diverse pieces of evidence and testimony...`
`make it clear that you had an intense hatred for your husband.`
` On the other hand, your claim,`
` that you eventually accepted his feelings, is unsupported by evidence."`
`".........I, I loved my husband...!!"`
`"You can't find any testimony or evidence that can be used to elevate that statement to the level of red truth, can you?"`
`"D‐......does a person need evidence to say they're in love...?!"`
`"Nothing can be trusted except for red truth...!!`
` Statements that aren't red don't count as evidence at all, and they can't be trusted at all!`
` All text that is not red is a falsehood that exists to deceive me!!"`
`"‘I love him’?`
` Who would believe a profession of love in white text?`
` No non‐red words can ever be trusted!!`
` The only things that can be trusted in this world are the red truth and the pieces of evidence I offer to my master to obtain it!!"`
`"You lying {y:0:Humans}{n:0:humans} can't speak the truth!!`
` {y:0:Humans}{n:0:Humans} lacking the red truth have no right to speak of love or the heart or truth!`
` Did you know?`
` Men aren't as stupid as you women think they are.`
` Men never really take it seriously when a woman says "I love you"...!"`
`"......What a pitiful person......`
` I see you've never truly loved someone..."`
`"Romance is unnecessary for a detective.`
` I don't think I've ever used the word "romance" except to explain the motive for murder."`
`"No matter what you say, we loved each other...!!`
` I owe my husband an apology for always writing down my complaints and nothing else...!`
` But I gave my heart to him...!!`
` Even if I can't prove it with evidence, ......that is the truth!!"`
`"Overruled.`
` You just don't know when to give up, do you?`
` From evidence and testimony, it's clear by now...`
`that you hated both your husband and the Ushiromiya family."`
`"That's right!!`
` I can't even count the number of times I've heard you complain...!!"`
`"Don't we all...? I remember there being days when you talked behind Hideyoshi‐san's back...!"`
`"You {i:killed} my husband!!`
` How {i:dare} you say that?!!`
` Die! Die so you can apologize to my husband in the afterlife!!"`
`"Please cease your violence, Eva‐san.`
` This is my delectable moment where I question and convict the culprit.`
` It's not yours, okay?"`
`"Now then.`
` Over the next several years, she appeared to have gotten used to her new way of life,`
` but in actuality, an intense hatred still lurked in her heart.`
` Taking that into consideration, there would be nothing odd at all about her deciding to take revenge."`
`"D‐don't act like you know what I'm thinking...!!"`
`Each time Erika read from Natsuhi's diaries,`
` ......she exposed another of Natsuhi's emotions during those painful days.`
`......Natsuhi hadn't written them down to record them for posterity.`
`{n}She had written to forget those memories and seal them away.`
`That was why, after writing down her feelings during those painful days,`
` ......she had locked them up and sealed them away for all eternity.`
`However, Erika claimed that these were Natsuhi's true, hidden feelings...`
`that had been locked away and concealed.`
`Since it had already been "concluded" that Natsuhi was a murderer, everyone accepted Erika's claim.`
`By this point, the red truth wasn't even necessary to establish Natsuhi's motive.`
`{n}As long as the reason seemed plausible, everyone would believe it.`
`No matter how much Natsuhi might object, no one would believe her.`
`No one could accept the truth Natsuhi spoke of, about the days she had spent loving her husband.`
`And so it was being painted over by a false truth, in which she hated her husband and swore revenge against him......`
`The pen of the gods that composes the truth had been given to Erika.`
`"And so what?!`
` Who gives a damn about your past?!!`
` Murderer, murdereeeeeer!!"`
`"S‐stop that...!`
` I can understand how Natsuhi‐san felt...!"`
`"I always thought this day might come, eventually......`
` ...Poor thing, poor thing......"`
`"I think she's another one of the pitiable victims...`
`of Father's wild life."`
`"I knew of the pain in Madam's heart......`
` I always tried to support her......`
`but I failed, and look what has happened......"`
`"......I don't...`
`...even understand...`
`...the emotions of love and hate."`
`".........You will, someday.`
` They can give you a reason to live...`
`and also a reason to kill."`
`"....................."`
`"...........................`
` ......I‐`
`......is Aunt Natsuhi...`
`...really the culprit...?"`
`"Well, now that you mention it, there is...`
`one last person besides Natsuhi‐san that might be the culprit."`
`"Wh‐......what?`
` Hey, are you serious...?!`
` Why the hell didn't you say something that important sooner?!!"`
`"Natsuhi‐san.`
` The truth is, there is one person besides you for whom the crime was possible.`
` ......If you insist on claiming that you aren't the culprit,`
` it means that person must be the culprit."`
`"............Huh......?"`
`"Who is it...?!`
` Who...?!"`
`"Ushiromiya...Kinzo‐san."`
`".........Ah, ............"`
`"Early this morning, Kinzo‐san...`
`went outside through the window of the third floor study, and his location is unknown.`
` Isn't that right, Battler‐san?"`
`"......Mgh........."`
`"Just like Natsuhi‐san,`
` Kinzo‐san has no alibi whatsoever.`
` The truth is, for this crime, it was possible for Kinzo‐san to be the culprit as well."`
`"I simply assumed that he never existed in the first place,`
` so I completely forgot about him until this very moment.`
` Allow me to apologize."`
`She didn't look shy or apologetic in the slightest.`
`Erika bowed in as unpleasant a manner as ever...`
`......Even now, she's still holding a grudge over her defeat in the study...`
`"Natsuhi‐san, you gained Kinzo‐san's trust and are the person who served closest to him, isn't that right?`
` In that case, I think you understand better than anyone else...`
`...that this incident is actually the crime of the family head, carried out by Ushiromiya Kinzo‐san."`
`"Y‐`
`.........you dare...`
`...call Father......a criminal......?"`
`"Don't worry.`
` Even if Kinzo‐san is actually the culprit,`
` I have prepared more than enough evidence and testimony to explain the whydunit.`
` Even if you were to say, for example, that you were putting yourself on the line to cover for Kinzo's crime, I am more than capable of carrying forward such a plot."`
`"In recent years,`
` even the theories created by the detective can sometimes change the plot itself.`
` You really can't afford to be careless in this day and age."`
`"......Branding Father as a killer...`
`...is something I will not allow!!"`
`"Natsuhi‐san.`
` Calm down, place your hand on your chest, and think carefully.`
` ......If you accuse Kinzo‐san of being the culprit, this entire case will be resolved.`
` You will no longer be held accountable for another person's actions, and your honor will be restored."`
`In other words, by pushing the crime onto Kinzo, Natsuhi would be saved......`
`However.........`
`"I, ......I have been entrusted with the honor of the Ushiromiya family......by Father...`
` ...Do you really think......that I would defile Father's honor...the Ushiromiya family honor...`
`just to clear away the false accusations made against me...?!!"`
`Of course, Natsuhi knew that she wasn't the culprit.`
`{n}And she also knew that Kinzo wasn't.`
`So being framed herself and pushing the blame onto Kinzo...`
`were both unacceptable, unbearable outcomes.`
`"Are you sure?`
` As I have already established quite thoroughly,`
` alibis have been proven for everyone except you.`
` If you do not accuse Kinzo‐san,`
` ......then it really will be clear that you are the culprit,`
` and that {i:will} become the truth......"`
`"If labelling me as the culprit is what you call truth,`
` then you can do as you please...!`
` I am certain that God knows I am innocent...!`
` And one day, he will prove it!!"`
`If it came to a choice between her or Kinzo being framed for these crimes...`
`{n}......Natsuhi would sacrifice herself.`
`Perhaps...`
`...that was her way...`
`...of protecting the Ushiromiya family honor.`
`"...............Aunt......Natsuhi........."`
`"And I even gave you a chance..."`
`...............Stupid woman.`
`This future where your name will eventually be cleared...`
`doesn't exist, not for you or any of the other pieces in this game.`
`Natsuhi......had made her decision.`
`If they were going to call her the culprit,`
` ......she would let them.`
`She boldly rejected the thought...`
`of selling Kinzo's honor to gain a momentary truth where she wasn't the culprit......`
`And, therefore...`
`...the tale would be woven with her as the culprit.`
`If, in the future, the accusations against her were to be proven false,`
` this tale would probably be rewritten......`
`However, such a future would never come.`
`......I think...`
`truth is a fleeting thing.`
`Even if I am a good person up until my death...`
`...if some heartless person after my death writes down that I wasn't a good person,`
` and that is shared with everyone else...`
`......then even all the goodness in which I lived my life will be overwritten easily.`
`And so, I think...`
`{n}I must live as a good person for all eternity......`
`"......If you claim that Kinzo‐san was not the culprit,`
` he will need an alibi which proves that the crimes were impossible for him.`
` Otherwise, we cannot truly be certain that you are the culprit, Natsuhi‐san."`
`Erika had to be well aware by now...`
`...that Kinzo was nothing more than an illusion to muddy the waters of the inheritance problem.`
`However, proving him to be an illusion would be very hard.`
`The only way to do this would be to confirm Kinzo's death,`
` ......but Kinzo died a long time ago, as revealed by the red truth of previous games.`
`And in this fifth game, his body hasn't even appeared.`
`Under these circumstances, it wouldn't be easy to prove his death conclusively......`
`If Kinzo's death could be confirmed, ......it would practically erase that defeat in the study.`
`It was the only way Erika had of negating the humiliation of her loss.`
`And there was something that could confirm Kinzo's death almost as certainly as real proof.`
`And that was...............“the confession of the culprit”.`
`She would have Natsuhi herself admit that Kinzo no longer existed in this world.`
`That way, it would be acknowledged that Erika's reasoning in the study was correct,`
` ......that loss would be painted over, and it would be rewritten as Erika's victory......`
`Battler hung suspended by Dlanor's red longsword.`
`Beato had disappeared by having her existence denied, ......and her minions had gone too.`
`Now that they had disappeared from this cathedral,`
` ......only Natsuhi and the witches convicting her remained.`
`"So,`
` ......you still claim that Kinzo is alive and remains somewhere on this island......?"`
`"Yes, I do...!`
` Father is in good health...!`
` No matter what anyone says, I will not change my statement...!"`
`"The red truth from the previous games says that`
` {p:1:Kinzo is already dead}.`
` ......But that's not enough to satisfy you, right, Bern?"`
`"......Yeah, that's right.`
` I'm after a perfect victory.`
` ......So there's nothing interesting about getting a checkmate just because Kinzo's death has been confirmed by the red.`
` ......I want to win by forcing Natsuhi to say that she's resigned.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"Then why don't you try it?`
` Show me what you've got."`
`"My master, let us now achieve a perfect victory...!!"`
`"Of course.`
` ............Natsuhi.`
` You say that Kinzo is certainly alive, but you don't know where he is, correct?"`
`"Yes, that's right...!`
` Father left through the window and his location is unknown...!`
` He is so troublesome sometimes......!"`
`"Lambda.`
` I'm going to make Kinzo's location from midnight until the morning absolutely clear.`
` ......`
`{p:1:From midnight until morning, Kinzo stayed in the same room}."`
`"......?`
` Well, duh, he was a corpse after all.`
` ...........................`
` ...No, I'm sorry.`
` That's right, totally right.`
` I won't butt in.`
` It sounds interesting, so keep going."`
`".........From now on, I will use the word "Kinzo" to mean "a living Kinzo".`
` After all, Natsuhi claims that he's alive.`
` ......I'll say more with the red truth.`
` {p:1:Kinzo does not exist anywhere outside the mansion}.`
` ......Isn't that right? Erika."`
`"Y‐yes, my master...!!`
` I searched for Kinzo all over the premises outside the mansion...!`
` However, I was unable to find him...!"`
`Because of the detective's authority, Erika could "find all clues".`
`Therefore, if Erika was unable to find "a hint that Kinzo existed outside the mansion",`
` it was the same as proving that Kinzo didn't exist outside the mansion.`
`Therefore, {f:5:Bernkastel} repeated that truth of Erika's...`
`"{p:1:Kinzo does not exist outside the mansion}.`
` ............So, Natsuhi.`
` That means that {i:if Kinzo exists}, he must be somewhere inside the mansion.`
` Do you have any idea where Kinzo might be hiding......?"`
`"H‐how could I know...?!`
` After all, think of the weather.`
` After going out into the courtyard, it would not be surprising at all...`
`if he hid somewhere in the mansion to escape the rain...!"`
`"Pfft, ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*.`
` I'm going to repeat that same question several times during this process.`
` ......I'll give you many chances for an honorable surrender.`
` ...If you're too stubborn, you'll lose even your true honor."`
`".........N‐no matter how you threaten me, I will not give in...!!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*.`
` I just love teasing pieces like you.`
` ......Then, let's keep going."`
`"......For these reasons, it is unthinkable that Kinzo‐san might be somewhere outside the mansion.`
` ......After learning that, we performed an extensive search of the third floor, where the study is."`
`"However, there was nowhere he could have been hiding.`
` .........We didn't catch any trace of Dad on the third floor."`
`"So then, where is he, Natsuhi‐san?"`
`"I, I don't know...!`
` If he isn't on the third floor, perhaps he's hiding in the basement...?"`
`"Ah, yes, the basement.`
` We searched all of that suspicious basement, including the boiler room and the underground storeroom."`
`"Yes, I searched too...!`
` I didn't see Father anywhere...!"`
`"I'll ask again.`
` Where is Kinzo‐san, Natsuhi‐san?"`
`"I‐in that case, he was probably on the first floor or the second floor...!!"`
`"I see, process of elimination does tell us that, doesn't it?`
` We then thoroughly searched the first floor.`
` And the result?"`
`".........Nope.`
` We were unable to find Father."`
`"I'll ask again.`
` Where was Kinzo‐san, Natsuhi‐san?"`
`"Th‐then he was probably hiding on the second floor...!!`
` How should I know where Father is hiding?!"`
`"Are you sure about that...?`
` I think you know very well where Kinzo‐san was hiding..."`
`"M‐`
`......Madam knows where the Master was...`
`...hiding......?!"`
`".........That's...impossible..."`
`"That......can't be true......"`
`Both Shannon and Kanon knew that Kinzo was no longer alive.`
`So they didn't have a clue how Erika was planning to corner Natsuhi...`
`using a phantom of a person who didn't exist......`
`"{p:1:Kinzo is nowhere outside the mansion.`
` Kinzo isn't on the third floor.`
` Kinzo isn't in the basement.`
` Kinzo isn't on the first floor.`
` Therefore, the only place Kinzo could possibly exist is the second floor}."`
`"I accept that red truth.`
` ......Natsuhi.`
` Kinzo should be somewhere on the second floor.`
` Will you still not tell us where he's hiding...?"`
`"N‐no matter how many times you ask, it won't change the fact that I don't know!"`
`"Erika.`
` Investigate the entire second floor, starting from one end and going in order.`
` ......Use the detective's authority to avoid missing a single clue and to see through all types of hidden doors and hidden rooms...!"`
`"Yes, my master...!!`
` Natsuhi‐san, you're quite slow, aren't you...?`
` Can you still not see where we're going with this?"`
`"*giggle*.`
` No need to give it away.`
` Come on, Erika.`
` Take everyone with you and begin the investigation...!"`
`Erika used her detective's authority to take everyone, even Natsuhi,`
` up to the second floor to search every room, starting at one end.`
`Even for rooms that were thought to have nothing at all to do with the crime, Erika did not relax her search in the slightest.`
`...Her search was thorough in every single room as they moved through them all......`
`"So, you still won't tell us where Kinzo‐san is hiding?"`
`"Stop saying that!`
` How many times do I have to say that I don't know...?!"`
`"Natsuhi‐san.`
` ......It doesn't matter where we search, we won't ever be able to find Kinzo‐san, will we?"`
`"......?!"`
`Of course not.`
` Kinzo doesn't exist.`
`No matter how long this search continues, it's just a waste of time.`
`This was known by both Erika, who was the witch's piece, and Natsuhi, the one who knew the truth......`
`"In that case, this search will end at the room on the far end of that corridor.`
` ......In other words, it will have been proven...`
`that Kinzo wasn't in any of the rooms except that one. What do you think will happen then?"`
`He isn't on the third floor or the first floor or the basement,`
` and he isn't in any of the rooms on the second floor except possibly the one at the end.`
`So if he really did exist inside the mansion,`
` .........it had been proven that he could not be in any room except for that room at the end.`
`In other words, this was Hempel's Raven.`
`Because it had been established that a "living Kinzo" didn't exist anywhere except the final room at the end of the corridor,`
` that automatically meant that a "living Kinzo" existed in that final room...`
`......And that room at the end of the corridor was......`
`"Oh, ............ah.................."`
`"Which room was at the end of the corridor, again?"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} was munching on another refill of popcorn.`
`"That's Natsuhi's room, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}...!!"`
`"......In other words, Kinzo had no place to hide except inside Natsuhi's room.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*!`
` Do I need to say it in red?"`
`"Of course...!"`
`"{p:1:Kinzo does not exist anywhere outside Natsuhi's room}!"`
`"Well then.`
` That means this room is the only place left.`
` ......From everything we have learned, we now know that Kinzo‐san isn't anywhere outside this room."`
`"B‐......but this is my room!!`
` Where exactly in my room do you claim Father is hiding...?!"`
`In a rage, Natsuhi unlocked the door to her room and pointed inside.`
`......Of course, Kinzo was nowhere to be seen.`
`"Do you see Father anywhere in here?!`
` Look!!"`
`".........Yes, it seems as though he isn't here.`
` Do you think he realized we were coming and escaped out of the window again?"`
`If Kinzo wasn't in this last room, ......it meant that he didn't exist anywhere.`
`"There is no living Kinzo outside the mansion".`
`{n}"There is no living Kinzo inside the mansion".`
`Therefore, “no living Kinzo exists”.`
`However, Erika didn't make that argument.`
`{n}She had brought things to this point, but she didn't make it checkmate...`
`It was because {f:5:Bernkastel} didn't want to win by cornering Natsuhi with the red truth,`
` but by forcing Natsuhi to admit to a humiliating resignation......`
`"I have not only been searching for Kinzo‐san himself all this time.`
` I have been looking for any sign at all that Kinzo‐san hid in these places between midnight and the morning.`
` And no such signs have existed."`
`"......In other words, we know that from midnight until morning,`
` Kinzo was always holed up in the same room,`
` and that was Natsuhi's room!"`
`"It means the checkmate of red truth has finally...`
`trapped the piece known as "the illusion of Kinzo" inside Natsuhi's room."`
`"So, Natsuhi‐san.`
` This means you were with Kinzo in this room until morning.`
` Do you still claim that you didn't know where he was?"`
`"I'll acknowledge it with the red truth...!!`
` {p:1:For the entire duration of the night between midnight and morning,`
` a living Kinzo could not have existed anywhere outside Natsuhi's room}!!`
` Based on this truth, I permit you to continue the debate under the assumption that he could only have existed in Natsuhi's room!"`
`"Plea bargain.`
` ............Come on, Natsuhi.`
` ......Even someone as stupid as you must have realized the fix you're in now.`
` This is your last chance.`
` .........Make Kinzo the culprit."`
`"Call the Ushiromiya family head a criminal and crush the head's honor to save your own skin.`
` If you show that you have the guts to do that,`
` I'll change the plot into one of a tragic heroine taking the blame to protect the family head."`
`"Father is innocent!`
` I cannot call Father a criminal!!"`
`"......Deal refused!`
` Ehehehehehehehe, okay, Bern.`
` Do it...!"`
`"{p:1:For the entire duration of the night between midnight and morning,`
` a living Kinzo could not have existed in any place except inside your bed}."`
`".........Wha—`
`......and...`
`...wh‐`
`...what do you mean...by that............?"`
`"After conducting a thorough search of this room,`
` and detailed forensic testing,`
` I discovered that Kinzo did not exist anywhere in this room between midnight and morning.`
` However, your bed alone is excluded from this."`
`A shocked silence dominated the room......`
`{n}Natsuhi completely forgot to close her open mouth...`
`"Last night,`
` at around the time the gold was discovered—I estimate 23:00—`
`Kinzo‐san escaped from the window on the third floor and snuck into the bed in your room.`
` ......And, as an even more unfortunate result from my investigation,`
` it has been proven that you were also sleeping in that bed."`
`"I'll repeat that.`
` {p:1:For the entire duration of the night between midnight and morning,`
` a living Kinzo could not have existed in any place except inside Natsuhi's bed.`
` And last night, Natsuhi also slept in that same bed}."`
`"Wow, look how close they were.`
` So, you two were so close to each other, you slept sharing the same pillow?"`
`"Blue truth:`
` {p:2:Therefore, we can conjecture that Ushiromiya Natsuhi and Ushiromiya Kinzo had sexual relations with each other.`
` Why else would a man and a woman share the same bed all night long}?"`
`"H‐how dare you!!!`
` T‐t‐to suggest that I would...`
`...d‐do such a thing......with the father I respected so much...`
`...I won't allow you to say such things!!"`
`"Natsuhi.`
` Use the red truth to counter this blue truth.`
` Of course, you aren't a witch, so there's no red that you can use.`
` So I'll speak with the red truth in your place.`
` If you can show me convincing proof...!!"`
`"H‐`
`......how could there possibly...`
`b‐be proof of that?!!`
` How low are you willing to sink to mock me?!`
` Y‐you vile creatuu{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}ure!!"`
`Natsuhi tried to attack Erika,`
` ...but Eva pinned her arms behind her back, so she couldn't do anything.`
`"How unsightly.`
` ......In order to take revenge against the Ushiromiya family,`
` you first schemed to take control of everything the family owned.`
` For that reason, you used your body as a weapon and ensnared Kinzo‐san."`
`"I would never do anything of the sort!!`
` I have never given my body to anyone except my husband!!"`
`"I understand why you'd want to deny it,`
` ............but testimony from several witnesses makes it clear that you have had repeated secret meetings with Kinzo‐san."`
`"I mean, even last night, you and Kinzo‐san...`
`were all alone in his study when you went to "say goodnight to him", weren't you?`
` Not only that, I have obtained multiple pieces of testimony claiming that there were clear traces of sexual relations."`
`"Are you insane?!?!`
` Who was it?!`
` Who said something so ridiculous?!`
` G‐Gohda?!`
` Shannon?!`
` Was it Eva‐san?!`
` Yes, you must be behind something this ludicrous!!"`
`"Who was it?! Whooooo?!`
` Aaaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}hhhhh!!!"`
`"I acknowledge receipt of the relevant parties' testimony.`
` Wow, this is pretty fatal.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*...! No room for doubt now!"`
`"Hey, Natsuhi.`
` Looks like you don't even have a scrap of honor left now.`
` ......I'll give you one final chance before I weave you the worst of all possible fragments.`
` ......Say to me that there was no Kinzo."`
`"Yeah. Natsuhi, you sure are stubborn.`
` ......The Ushiromiya family has already been torn to ribbons, right?`
` ...Are you really that desperate to confuse the inheritance problem by pretending Kinzo exists?"`
`"This is my final trial, entrusted to me by Father......in protecting the honor of the Ushiromiya family...!!`
` My husband's business will definitely......definitely bear fruit!!`
` Until we can use that to repay our debts, I cannot hand over the inheritance of the Ushiromiya family!!"`
`"I will protect Father's honor and my husband's!!`
` That is......my mission!!!"`
`"......Wanting to protect the honor of the dead is an admirable trait."`
`"He's not one of the dead.`
` We're talking about the honor of a convenient delusion inside Natsuhi's head.`
` ......`
`{p:1:The real Kinzo never once ordered Natsuhi...`
`to do anything like protect his honor}."`
`"Waaaaaaaaaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ahhhhhhh!!"`
`As Natsuhi screamed, she fell down to her hands and knees......`
`She no longer...`
`...had any way to reject the fake truth...`
`...that {f:5:Bernkastel} and Erika had weaved......`
`".........By my name as the Game Master, {f:5:Lambdadelta}!`
` ......I acknowledge that Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} is the victor of this game.`
` ......If anyone has any objections, state your name now!!"`
`.................................`
`Of course, there were none.`
` All of those who might have objected had been erased......`
`"No objections!`
` You win, Bern, and what a win it was!`
` Now weave the fragment of truth!!"`
`"Sure.`
` Then I will now weave the truth.`
` ......This is the truth of this sad and foolish tale.`
` ......Although, what I really wanted was for Natsuhi to admit to her crimes while smiling through tears and then tell her own story.`
` After all, that's standard in the genre, right?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
