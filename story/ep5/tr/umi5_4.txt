`"This rose garden really is a masterpiece.`
` It's gotten even more awesome than it was six years ago.`
` You're so lucky to have this as your yard!"`
`"Are you kidding?`
` For me, it just makes it a longer walk to the harbor, which is a real pain."`
`"Hahaha.`
` That's a pretty luxurious worry."`
`"Uu!`
` Getting to say hi to the roses every morning before school, so awesome!`
` You must get late after saying hi to so many roses...!"`
`"Shame about Ange though.`
` I hear her stomach gets upset easily?"`
`"Apparently.`
` It's probably her intestines that are weak.`
` She's always getting diarrhea."`
`"Uu.`
` You shouldn't say something like that about a lady......"`
`"Ihihihihi, sorry about that.`
` Yeah, I forgot, marshmallows are what comes out of a girl's butt, ri~ght?`
` So, Ange got sick, and the marshmallows turned into syrup."`
`"Yeah, that's just—"`
`"Too disgusting."`
`George and Jessica slammed a knee and a fist right into either side of Battler's gut.`
`Whack,`
` smackthud.`
`......The smackthud was probably the sound of his knees hitting the ground and him falling over.`
`Normally, Battler possessed the good sense you'd expect of an 18‐year‐old man.`
`However, it seemed that this reunion had brought him back to the mental age he had been six years ago.`
`And bit by bit,`
` Jessica and George realized that they were also returning to the way they'd been six years ago...`
`This "charming" chat...`
`was being observed by Natsuhi, gazing through an open window in the hall.`
`".........Madam.`
` Krauss‐sama is searching for you."`
`"I'll go in just a bit.`
` ......It isn't even lunchtime yet, ...and I'm already tired."`
`The sparks had been flying between them and Eva's group only a few moments earlier.`
`The others had pounded on Krauss and Natsuhi over and over to get Kinzo out of his study...`
`Apparently, they hadn't been fully tricked at last year's family conference after all......`
`".........There are......no problems with Father, I assume...?"`
`"Correct.`
` ......Leave it to me.`
` Shannon and Kanon are also fully aware of today's arrangements."`
`"......Kumasawa is a good liar, so I'm not worried about her, ...but I am a little concerned about Doctor Nanjo.`
` ......I get the feeling he's bad at hiding things."`
`".........Leave that to me.`
` I intend to support Doctor Nanjo from nearby as much as possible."`
`"It's very reassuring to have you there.`
` .........It really helps a lot.`
` ...Without your strength, we wouldn't be able to succeed."`
`"......I am honored by your words."`
`"Don't worry.`
` The locked‐room barrier on the study is perfect.`
` As long as the barrier remains unbroken, no one will be able to expose Kinzo's secret."`
`".........Yes, I understand.`
` Still, you heard that conversation in the parlor just now, didn't you?"`
`"......Mm.`
` It seems that some considerable suspicions were aroused last year.`
` The terrible toxin has accumulated and is being spread all around."`
`"......It seems this year's conference really will be crucial."`
`"We might be able to overcome this year somehow, ......but there is such a thing as pushing our luck.`
` It's probably best to assume that next year won't be manageable."`
`".........With this much of the anti‐magic toxin filling up the place,`
` it will probably be difficult to preserve Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}'s magic for yet another family conference."`
`"W‐......who are you?"`
`"Oh,`
` no need to be surprised.`
` This man serves as my head furniture."`
`"Greetings, Madam Natsuhi.`
` My name is Ronove.`
` It is a pleasure to meet you......"`
`"This man's reliable.`
` He's also helping to guard the locked‐room barrier."`
`"......Is that so?`
` I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi.`
` I thank you for your cooperation."`
`"Of course, Madam.`
` ......I will be aiding you from the magic world.`
` Please rely on me."`
`"............In that case, I guess I'll introduce myself next.`
` <Hi>, Riiche.`
` Long time no see......"`
`"Ah, Gaap!!`
` It's heartening to see that you're here as well!"`
`"......Well, I only came to have some fun.`
` ......If you need an extra hand, let me know.`
` Nice to meet you, <Madam>.`
` ......This is the first time I've said hello, but I'm always right by anyone's side."`
`"Pu ku ku.`
` Gaap here is quite the prankster...`
` Remember that headache medicine you dropped on the floor of your room and lost as you were getting dressed?`
` Gaap was the one behind that."`
`"Whenever you set something small down somewhere but can't find it later, it's always a good idea to suspect that it's one of her pranks.`
` ......Long ago, she used to tease me all the time!"`
`"I‐...is that so?`
` ......In any event, this is the Ushiromiya mansion.`
` As long as you are here, you will obey us.`
` You understand, correct?"`
`"Of course.`
` We understand.`
` ......Think of me as a Genji of the magic world, and please give me orders whenever you wish."`
`".........I'm pretty sure I know how to be a good guest.`
` ...I won't let the landlord lose face."`
`"You can count on Ronove and Gaap.`
` However, the magic world and the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world are two different sides of the same coin."`
`"I understand.`
` ......Of course, I will do all I can in the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world.`
` Let's work together and protect Father's secret."`
`"Mm."`
`"......This happens every time.`
` We won't get anywhere until the next day."`
`"Hmm?`
` Well, su~re. October 4th is like a preparation turn for me.`
` If you don't feel like doing anything, why don't you just sit around until October 5th?`
` I'll call you after the first six die.`
` *giggle*giggle*......!"`
`......Of course, that was a very irritating way to say it.`
`The fight wouldn't start until the crime occurred.`
`However, waiting for the crimes to start would mean turning a blind eye towards the murders of the first twilight.`
`In other words, it would be the same as being content with the fact that six people would die......`
`"............Did you know?`
` They say that in chess, the player who moves first is twice as likely to win."`
`"Although that can change as the tactics of the match progress.`
` Don't they say that the second player has a much better chance at a draw?"`
`"......Even I know what "the first to strike wins" means.`
` .........Then what are you trying to say?"`
`"Pff, *giggle*giggle*!`
` This is why you're so incompetent."`
`"......Seriously.`
` ......Are you listening, Battler?`
` There is a mystery which can be solved even on October 4th.`
` ......Do you know what that is?"`
`"You don't mean......`
` ............No, but..."`
`"Heheheheheheh!`
` ......Well, watch and see, Battler the incompetent!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*..."`
`I have a general idea what these witches are talking about.`
`......I've tried solving it several times myself in the past, but I still haven't found anything resembling an answer.`
`On the contrary, I still can't even understand {i:why that riddle exists}.`
`.........That's right.`
` ...The reason it exists.`
`{n}Why did Beato...`
`...prepare a riddle like that in the first place......?`
`We all discussed it together from time to time in past games.`
`However, I've been avoiding thinking about it under the assumption that there's no point in investigating the riddle unless we can solve it.`
`......This time, I should change my viewpoint.`
`I shouldn't just focus on the obvious parts...`
`like the truth of the riddle and how to solve it.`
`{n}......What's more important is why that riddle was set up in the first place and displayed for us to see.`
`{n}That's what I should be thinking about.`
`And the one proposing that riddle......is {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`Even if I can't solve it, I should be able to try and figure out what Beato was thinking when she showed it to us.`
`......Alright...this time, I'm turning the chessboard over...`
`{n}The witches keep calling me incompetent.`
`Let them laugh.`
` ......My enemy isn't them.`
`{n}......I'm continuing our match,`
` Beato......`
`"......Oh.`
` Seems like it's finally started raining."`
`"Sheesh...`
` I wish I could keep the downpour limited to the inside of my heart."`
`The people in the parlor noticed that raindrops had started to drip down the window.`
`"So now, we have nowhere to run until the family conference ends."`
`"......The same thing goes for Nii‐san and his accomplices.`
` ......I won't let them escape, you can be certain of that...`
` The cards we're holding aren't bad.`
` Nii‐san is just bluffing.`
` ......I'll make certain that he surrenders..."`
`"Well, the thing about a deal is,`
` you don't go in tryin' to {i:beat} the other guy.`
` ......You get a pitfall ready, praise him a bit, and convince him to stand on it of his {i:own} accord."`
`"......Hideyoshi‐san is right.`
` You pressed him a little too hard just now, Eva nee‐san."`
`"Th‐that was perfectly reasonable considering it's Nii‐san we're dealing with."`
`"Hm? Has Rosa fallen asleep?"`
`"She was complainin' about how early she woke up this morning.`
` Well, guess there's nothin' wrong with taking a nap."`
`"There's a chance we might be forced to spend all night on this.`
` Getting a nap in now is probably a smart idea."`
`Out of consideration for Rosa, who had fallen asleep on a sofa, the others quietly left the parlor.`
`Rosa slept, unaware.`
`After telling Maria to just stay where she was after that tantrum over not being able to find her rose,`
` Rosa slept, unaware that the rain had started to fall......`
`The rain poured down as though it had been saving up for this moment.`
`Of course, Maria noticed that the rain had started falling and was soaking her to the bone.`
`However, that just made her even more stubborn.`
`Unable to find the poor, slightly unhealthy rose that she herself had marked,`
` ......she just couldn't stand having that search be interrupted by something like the rain.`
`So the more the rain fell on Maria, the more stubborn she grew,`
` and she wandered around and around the rose beds...`
`As she did, .........from behind her back, ............came a patter‐patter.`
` ...The sound of approaching footsteps.`
`Then, whoever it was stepped in a very small puddle, making a light splashing sound, and Maria finally heard.`
`However, even the slight distraction that sound caused made her feel irritated, and Maria ignored it despite having heard it.`
`{a:c:`
`"............Hello."}`
`"......ah."`
`Maria turned around, bewildered.`
`......After all, that voice...`
`was one she didn't recognize at all.`
`On this sealed‐off Rokkenjima, ......that voice belonged to no person she knew...`
`"Krauss‐sama, Madam.`
` ......I was looking for you.`
` Something important has come up."`
`Krauss and Natsuhi had been privately discussing what should be done next in a deserted corridor on the third floor.`
`Genji had searched everywhere for them.`
`"What is it?`
` It must be something more urgent than a few sheets getting wet by the rain."`
`"What is it?`
` Has there been some sort of blunder?"`
`"......A short while ago, someone came to the mansion...claiming to have drifted here after an accident at sea."`
`Krauss and Natsuhi couldn't help but go wide‐eyed and look at each other.`
`This was the first time they had ever heard of someone coming to this island uninvited.`
`"Someone drifted here......?`
` Is that true?`
` Poor thing.`
` ......Treat this person politely, like a guest.`
` What is happening now?"`
`"Doctor Nanjo is performing an examination.`
` ......He hasn't finished yet, but from what I could tell by looking, the drifter seemed tired but uninjured."`
`"That's good.`
` Natsuhi and I are having an important conversation right now.`
` We will come to check on this person when we are finished.`
` Please tell this drifter that we want them to feel at home."`
`"Certainly......"`
`Genji bowed deeply and started to leave, but Natsuhi called him to a stop.`
`{n}Genji stopped walking and Natsuhi jogged up to him...`
`".........Genji.`
` ...Is this drifter.........a man?"`
`"No.`
` ......She is a young woman, about the same age as Milady."`
`"...A woman...?`
` .........I see.`
` Very well. Back to your work."`
`The parlor of the mansion was bustling.`
` The adults gathered, concerned about the well‐being of this sudden guest...`
`"Well, if she was able to walk all the way to the rose garden by herself, her life probably isn't in danger."`
`"......It always helps to be prepared.`
` It's probably all thanks to the life jacket.`
` Without that, she might have drowned."`
`"What kind of girl was she?`
` Older or younger than George? Jessica‐chan?"`
`"She was younger than Jessica onee‐chan.`
` She was wearing a life jacket and swimsuit.`
` Looked all tired out...!"`
`"Assuming she washed up somewhere near the harbor, that must've been a bit of luck amid disaster.`
` It would've been terrible if she'd landed on the opposite side of the island..."`
`"......Still, you have to feel sorry for her.`
` With this weather, the boats won't be coming.`
` I imagine she'll also be stuck on this island all day tomorrow."`
`At that moment, the door clunked open and everyone looked in that direction.`
`"Would anyone like some tea?"`
`It was Gohda and Kanon,`
` with the latter pushing a serving cart laden with a tea set.`
`Gohda understood well that doing a little extra at times like this would earn him points.`
`The relatives, hungry for information, crowded around Gohda...`
`Gohda ordered Kanon to serve the tea and became the sole object of the relatives' attention.`
`"Gohda‐san, how's that kid doing?`
` Does she seem well...?"`
`"W‐...well, I don't know about that.`
` But there is no need to worry...!`
` Doctor Nanjo is giving his full attention to taking care of her, and Kumasawa and Shannon are with him.`
` Please, do not worry.`
` Why not relax with some black tea for now...?`
` Come, Kanon‐san.`
` Quickly, quickly, serve it, serve it."`
`"{e:070:...Why do {i:I} have to...}{e:100:"}`
`Kanon knew that this tea was just Gohda's way of earning points,`
` so he lined the cups up with a slightly sullen air.`
`"Uu.`
` I'll help too."`
`"......I‐it's alright.`
` You can just wait there, Maria‐sama."`
`"Uu!`
` I wanna serve tea too!"`
`"Didn't you talk with Doctor Nanjo?`
` Did he say anything?"`
`"Yes. When I met him a short while ago, he said that there weren't any serious external wounds...`
` And from what I could tell at a glance......"`
`Just as Gohda had successfully captured the gazes of all present and was about to start talking knowledgeably on the subject, Nanjo returned.`
`Of course, Nanjo instantly became the center of attention.`
` ......Kanon turned his back on Gohda, who seemed downhearted.`
`"Doctor Nanjo...!`
` How is her condition...?!`
` Does it look like she'll be alright?"`
`"Not to worry, everyone...`
` She is fine.`
` She had no injuries at all.`
` It seems that she is quite worn out, but there shouldn't be anything to worry about, as long as she doesn't develop a fever tonight."`
`"That's good to hear.`
` ......We're lucky enough to have a doctor, but this is no hospital."`
`Everyone was relieved to hear that the girl was in good health...`
`When Nanjo gave the more detailed results of his examination, concluding by saying that she was young and should therefore be fine,`
` everyone who no longer fell under this description nodded in assent.`
`"......Uu.`
` Boats really are scary.`
` Gonna faaall gonna faaall.`
` Battler was right..."`
`"Maria‐chan, let's not tell Battler‐kun about this."`
`"Oh, Madam! Krauss‐sama!"`
`Gohda, who was feeling sorry for himself and handing out cups, called out in an excessively loud voice.`
`Apparently, he was that desperate to get everyone's attention.`
`"......How is the guest?"`
`"Yes sir!`
` Her condition is not serious."`
`"I see. I am glad to hear it.`
` Where is she now...?"`
`"I believe Kumasawa‐san and Shannon‐san were showing her to the bath.`
` And they said they would get her some clothes afterwards."`
`"In that case, they will probably arrive here soon.`
` ......Everyone.`
` This may be the day of the family conference, but we have a guest brought here by an unfortunate accident.`
` She wasn't invited, but I want you all to welcome her."`
`"Who could disagree with that?`
` I'm all for it."`
`"Same here.`
` Didn't Mom always tell us to be nice to girls?"`
`"You take that line way too far."`
`"......It's probably best if we call George and the rest over here too.`
` Let's all greet her together."`
`"I'm not so sure...`
` Wouldn't that just make her feel more timid...?"`
`Eva stood up and made a phone call to the guesthouse.`
`At that moment, they heard the sound of a knock, followed by Genji's voice.`
`"......It is Genji.`
` The guest has arrived..."`
`At those words, everyone fell into silence, and the people who had been sitting stood up straight.`
`Genji came in first, opening the door slowly,`
` .........then moved off to the side, bowing deeply and urging the guest forwards.`
`The guest had Shannon and Kumasawa following by her side,`
` ......and though she looked at the large amount of relatives waiting for her in the parlor, she didn't seem overawed in the slightest.`
`Just this single point...`
`showed that this girl possessed a dignity appropriate for a guest invited in by the Ushiromiya family...`
`"......Furudo‐sama, allow me to introduce you.`
` This is Ushiromiya Krauss, the representative of the Ushiromiya family head."`
`"Welcome to Rokkenjima.`
` Though you arrived due to an accident, you are a guest of the family.`
` We welcome you.`
` Please, make yourself at home and relax however you please."`
`"............Thank you very much.`
` ...Allow me to introduce myself.`
` ......I am called Furudo Erika ({p:0:古戸ヱリカ})."`
`"My deepest apologies for disturbing you members of the Ushiromiya family like this.`
` ......I am truly grateful for the warm welcome I have received despite my status as an uninvited guest."`
`......There was a general sigh of acceptance.`
`The clothes she had been lent were probably Jessica's formal wear from long ago,`
` ......but the composure of her introduction gave the impression of a dignity by no means inferior to the clothes she wore...`
`The girl's name was Furudo Erika.`
`She looked slightly younger than Battler and Jessica,`
` but her composure and mannerisms were beyond what anyone would have expected from a high‐schooler, almost as though she was a well‐to‐do family's daughter...`
`"Wait a sec.`
` ......Who is this person?"`
`"............With someone incompetent like you as the main character piece, the game wouldn't get anywhere.`
` That's why I've placed myself there as a piece..."`
`"Well, it's just a bit of a bonus.`
` Even in a closed circle, it'd get boring to see the same faces every single time, right?"`
`"Quit messing around.`
` This piece doesn't exist on Beato's game board.`
` Beato and I won't acknowledge it...!"`
`"This is Beato's game board, right?`
` If Beato refuses, then I'll think about it.`
` And Beato's opinio~n?"`
`"...................................."`
`Beato was unable to answer.`
`{n}......{f:5:Lambdadelta} grinned as though in triumph.`
`"......Wanna try complaining about the rules and stepping down from the game?`
` Isn't that the favorite move of you mystery people{p:0:♪}`
` If there's even a tiny element that goes against your expectations, you have a tantrum and totally stop thinking."`
`".........Ugh..."`
`".........Don't worry.`
` I'll make a detective proclamation about this piece."`
`"Detective proclamation......?"`
`"{p:1:I proclaim that Furudo Erika is the detective}."`
`"{p:1:The detective is not the culprit}.`
` {p:1:No proof is needed to show this}.`
` ......In short, there is absolutely no need to suspect this girl.`
` With this guarantee, you can theorize the same way as you always did, even now that she's appeared as a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} piece, right...?"`
`"......That's Knox's seventh commandment.`
` ‘It is forbidden for the detective to be the culprit’.`
` There was an exception clause in the original, but for this game`
` ‘`
`{p:1:the detective isn't the culprit}’ has been proclaimed in red, so you don't need to consider the exception.`
` I hate word games, so I'll say it in red too.`
` {p:1:Furudo Erika is not the culprit}."`
`"Repetition requested.`
` ......‘Furudo Erika had no influence on any of Beato's games before now’."`
`"Sure, I'll respond.`
` {p:1:Furudo Erika had no influence on any of Beato's games before now}.`
` She's nothing more than an extra character who appears for the first time this round.`
` {p:1:She does not exist in the worlds before this one, nor does she influence them}."`
`"In that case, what happens to the number of people on this island right now?"`
`"Of course, it's plus 1 over the previous number.`
` But don't worry.`
` {p:1:It has only increased by one person: Furudo Erika}.`
` {p:1:Besides her, the number of people on this island is exactly the same as it was in the previous games}."`
`At that time, the loud sound of people running through the corridor could be heard.`
`It was Battler, George, and Jessica, who had come from the guesthouse after being called here by Eva.`
`They immediately spotted a guest they didn't recognize, and their eyes went wide.`
`"......Whoa...`
` ......Wh‐who are you.........?"`
`"Uu.`
` Guest.`
` She came by faaaall faaaalling."`
`"Huh?`
` Fall fall...??"`
`"...Genji‐san.`
` Who is this person...?"`
`"This is Furudo Erika‐sama, a guest.`
` ......Furudo‐sama,`
` this is the daughter of the family, Jessica‐sama, along with her cousins George‐sama and Battler‐sama."`
`"Umm, oh, ......n‐nice to meet you.`
` I'm Ushiromiya Jessica..."`
`"............Hello.`
` My name is Furudo Erika.`
` I am very pleased to meet you......"`
`Though Battler, George, and Jessica didn't have a clue what was going on and were utterly bewildered, they each introduced themselves...`
`"......Isn't that convenient.`
` This way, the number of people is clear.`
` The people in the guesthouse have joined up with the rest, and now, all of the pieces except for Kinzo—all of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s—have gathered in the parlor."`
`"Looks like it.`
` {p:1:In other words, the number of people in this parlor now is equal to the total number of people on this island}."`
`"There were supposedly 18 humans on the island, ...but since Grandfather was actually dead, that became 17.`
` ......And now that one piece of {f:5:Bernkastel}'s has been added......"`
`The number of humans on this island has returned to 18......`
`"I" glanced around at the humans in the parlor.`
`The guest, Furudo Erika.`
` And behind her, Kumasawa‐san and Shannon‐chan.`
` Off to the side was Genji‐san.`
`Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi were welcoming the guest.`
`Gohda‐san immediately started showing off,`
` and Kanon‐kun was being unsociable, wearing his usual blank expression.`
`There was Dad and Kyrie‐san.`
` Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi.`
` Auntie Rosa and Maria.`
` And Doctor Nanjo.`
`And on either side of me...`
`George‐aniki,`
` and Jessica...`
`This is everyone. The true number of people on the island at the moment......`
`"All of us are Ushiromiyas.`
` So please don't feel obligated to call us by our family name.`
` I'm George."`
`"I'm Battler.`
` Nice to meet you!"`
`"......Thank you very much, George‐san, Battler‐san.`
` ......I'd be pleased if you would call me Erika."`
`"Nice to meet you, Erika‐san...!"`
`Erika was welcomed like a guest,`
` and it was decided that she could borrow the bedroom next to the cousins' room on the upper floor of the guesthouse.`
`In front of all the relatives, she had seemed dignified and a bit stiff.`
`However, as she talked with George and Jessica, her expression began to soften gradually......`
`{m:-5:——}And so,`
` the "detective", Furudo Erika, was placed on the game board......`
`"I'm surprised that Jessica's old clothes suit her so well."`
`"......Kumasawa made the decision on her own to use Milady's old clothes.`
` Please forgive her."`
`The clothes Erika was wearing were Jessica's old formal attire.`
`Though the guest possessed a dignity that would put many adults to shame, her body was still physically similar to a middle‐schooler's.`
` Jessica's old clothes fit her perfectly.`
`"Not to worry.`
` They match this guest perfectly.`
` If she likes them, I should think it would be all right for her to keep them as a sign of friendship."`
`"......Certainly.`
` Thank you very much."`
`"Have you contacted the police and her family?"`
`"Yes.`
` They seemed to have been quite distressed."`
`"............By the way,`
` ......our guest really did...have an accident, right?"`
`"......She said that she fell from a boat as it was returning to port."`
`"Is there anything to back up that claim?"`
`"I checked with the Coast Guard.`
` It seems that she fell from the rear of a pleasure boat, unnoticed by the others on board.`
` We don't know the exact location she fell from, but it was probably somewhere near this island..."`
`".........How foolish, to be out boating with such a bad weather forecast.`
` All the same, ......is it really conceivable that she nearly drowned in the nearby waters and drifted to this island?"`
`"It is not impossible.`
` Tales of drifters washing ashore exist on several of the islands around this area."`
`"..........................."`
`"......I believe it likely that there was an accident.`
` ......This is the middle of a typhoon.`
` There is no place on this island where it would be possible to land a boat."`
`Genji had already figured it out.`
`Natsuhi almost certainly suspected that this mysterious guest, who had arrived during the already high‐stress family conference,`
` might be a pawn in someone's plot.`
`Therefore, Genji had already checked to make sure that the accident was real, that Furudo Erika was her real name,`
` and that there was nothing suspicious going on......`
`"......Very well.`
` My husband has ordered you to roll out the red carpet for her.`
` Make sure that there are no blunders.`
` ......However.........you understand, don't you?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......We will not allow her anywhere near the family conference.`
` After dinner, I will see that she retires to the guesthouse."`
`"Make sure that they don't start talking about letting her meet Father, or anything like that, either."`
`"Of course.`
` I will keep that in mind."`
`".........Hoh.`
` ...Furudo Erika, was it?`
` It's rare for guests to come here to Rokkenjima.`
` She looks as though she'll be entertaining, don't you think?"`
`"She is probably Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}'s piece.`
` ......Though she will follow the rules of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, the player is a witch.`
` We can't underestimate her."`
`"Hmph, there is no problem.`
` Even if she were Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} herself, she is a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, and so she is no match for us.`
` ......After all, we have Gaap with us.`
` {y:0:Human}{n:0:Human}s certainly cannot win against Gaap!"`
`"............Thanks.`
` Still, it's not a good idea to overestimate yourself.`
` ......The definition of a witch doesn't only imply the ability to use magic."`
`"True.`
` ......A joker and the eye of a typhoon.`
` That is what a witch is..."`
`"Hmph.`
` I'm the one who gets to call herself a witch on this Rokkenjima.`
` Only I, the Golden Witch and Endless Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!`
` Let us see how good Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}'s next piece after Ange is.`
` I intend to watch very carefully...!"`
