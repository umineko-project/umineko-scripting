`Knock‐knock‐knock‐knock!!!`
`The sudden sound of someone banging fiercely on the door brought Natsuhi to her senses.`
`She had probably nodded off in the study while planning how they would overcome the next day.`
`But...what could it be...?`
` At a time like this...`
`More importantly, the knock itself was strange.`
`If someone had wanted to contact her, they could have just used the internal phone line.`
`She had told them that she would be here.`
`Realizing that something strange was going on,`
` Natsuhi shook her head one more time, completely throwing off her drowsiness.`
`"Father, Father...!!`
` It's Eva.`
` I have something urgent and vital to talk to you about!"`
`It was Eva's voice.`
`......What is this?`
`I thought I told them to lock the doors and windows of the mansion tightly after everyone left for the guesthouse.`
`So why is Eva here...?!`
`Natsuhi ran up to the door, responded with a small knock, and spoke through the door in a quiet voice.`
`".........What do you want? Keep your voice down."`
`"Natsuhi nee‐san...?!`
` Why are you in Father's study at this hour?!"`
`"......I told you to be quiet!`
` Have you forgotten that the head treasures peace and silence above all else...?!"`
`"Now's not the time to be saying that!!`
` Stop harping on that and open up quickly!!`
` Bring Father out!!"`
`"The head just went to sleep!`
` I don't know what business you have, but I will listen to it tomorrow!"`
`"I don't have any business with you!!`
` Just open up right now!!"`
`Sometimes, all one's schemes and assumptions can fall apart due to the most direct, simple, and emotional of strategies.`
`This is bad...`
`If I open the door, Eva will probably throw herself forwards and rush into the study.`
`Now, I can't even open this door...!`
`At that moment, the phone suddenly rang.`
`I‐it's alright.`
` Both of the keys to the study are here.`
`No one can open this door...!`
`Natsuhi inched away from the door and grabbed the receiver...`
`"H‐...hello!!`
` It's Natsuhi!"`
`"It's me...`
` Things are bad.`
` I want you to come down to the parlor, quickly."`
`It was from Krauss.`
` His tone was strained.`
`......What in the world happened...?!`
`"It seems that Battler‐kun and the guest called Erika...`
`......solved the witch's epitaph and found the gold."`
`"Huh? ........................`
` ...Is, ...is that true?!"`
`"Rudolf and the rest have forced their way in.`
` They're saying that Battler‐kun is going to show us all the way to the location of the hidden gold..."`
`"Right now, Eva‐san is just outside the door, yelling at me to open it...!`
` If I open it now, she might push her way into the study...!!"`
`"...I, I understand.`
` I will be there soon.`
` Don't worry about Eva.`
` Just stay there and don't do anything...!`
` I'll give you a signal once I've gotten Eva away from the door, so leave as soon as you hear that.`
` Be ready...!"`
`Right after that, Krauss came up the staircase, accompanied by Genji.`
`A heated debate started between him and Eva. "Open up!" "No, calm down."`
`In the middle of that, there was a small knock as a signal.`
`......Krauss had skillfully pushed Eva away from the door and distracted her.`
`During that gap, Natsuhi slipped out of the study and quickly shut the door...`
`Eva noticed this, and her face twisted in disappointment,`
` but the heavy sound of the auto‐lock had already rung out, and the door had been sealed.`
`"The gold of the epitaph has been found!!`
` It's only natural that we should inform Father...!!`
` Or else what?`
` Is there some reason you can't tell Father about this?!"`
`"We have strict orders from Father not to wake him after he goes to bed under any circumstances.`
` Following those orders is the duty of the head's representative.`
` Isn't that right, Genji‐san?"`
`"............Yes.`
` The Master's sleep must not be disturbed, no matter the circumstances."`
`"There's a time and place for everything, isn't there...?!!`
` I mean, the epitaph was solved!!`
` Father has a right to know straight away!"`
`"Of course, the two of us will report on everything to the head tomorrow.`
` That's our duty as the head's representatives."`
`"I don't care about that!!`
` Just open this door!!`
` Let me see Father!!`
` Father, Father, can you hear me?`
` It's Eva!!`
` Please open up!!"`
`"Owowow, let go of me...!!`
` Th‐that hurts...!!"`
`"We will bring this to his attention......!`
` Now stop knocking on the door so loudly......!!"`
`"Ouch, owowowowow...!!`
` Let go, let go of me!!"`
`"Krauss‐sama, Eva‐sama.`
` You have been told that the Master is sleeping.`
` Please refrain from disturbing him any further...!"`
`When Genji spoke firmly, the two finally ceased their scuffle.`
`It seemed that Genji, the one who had spoken for Kinzo since they were very young, still possessed an air of dignity strong enough to handle both Krauss and Eva...`
`Eva put her argument aside for the time being.`
`She could worry about that after seeing the gold with her own eyes.`
`{n}After all, not even she had yet seen it for herself.`
`Natsuhi and the others had managed to deal with this crisis somehow.`
`......However, the demons' move which would sneer upon their efforts was already in motion...`
`"Battler.........solved the riddle of the epitaph, you say......?!"`
`"Mm.`
` ......Though he had a lot of help from that Erika girl, Battler was the one who reached the answer.`
` Erika has proclaimed that she will renounce her rights to the Golden Land.`
` ......Therefore, Battler is the one who reached the Golden Land."`
`".........Fate can be truly interesting.`
` To think that Battler‐sama should be the one to reach that place..."`
`"What will you do, Beato?`
` ......You made a promise to stop the ritual if anyone solved the epitaph's riddle."`
`"Mm.`
` ...That was the agreement."`
`".........That is the agreement.`
` Yes."`
`"Apparently, Battler‐sama does not intend to become the master of the Golden Land.`
` ......It now seems that no one will become our master."`
`"That is also fate.`
` It has been several decades since we first manifested in the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world through our bond with Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}.`
` ......It was all very fun."`
`".........Come on, Lia, you sound like an old lady.`
` ......So, what're we going to do?`
` According to Riiche and {f:5:Goldsmith}'s rules, now that Battler's solved the epitaph and decided not to become our master,`
` we've been relieved from duty, right?"`
`"That's true.`
` ......I have no regrets at all.`
` I've been prepared to be kicked down into Cocytus all this time."`
`"Wait.`
` We can't let that happen.`
` ......You might not have any regrets, but I still serve Natsuhi.`
` To let ourselves be relieved from duty just because Battler solved the epitaph would be quite irresponsible.`
` ......Witches aren't allowed to break contracts, but they also must not fail to show gratitude."`
`"......True.`
` We should serve her until the family conference ends."`
`"In that case, you won't be relieved from duty for a while either, Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}.`
` ......Perhaps you should wait until you've overcome this family conference safely, said goodbye to Natsuhi‐sama at the very least,`
` ......and if possible, rewarded her for all her efforts."`
`"...............Hmm.`
` ......She has done well supporting my foolish son."`
`"Aren't you a fallen angel with one of its wings plucked off?`
` Just leave the other wing as a parting gift and go."`
`"......Hmm.`
` ......That is also fitting.`
` Natsuhi might be worthy to bear my wing.`
` ...However, .........we are approaching the critical moment.`
` ......Your reward is waiting for you.`
` Try and overcome this test safely, ......Natsuhi..."`
`The mountain of gold left everyone speechless.`
`Regardless of how strongly they had believed in its existence,`
` ......no one could look at this much real gold and not be shocked...`
`"............To think that a place like this existed........."`
`"I can't believe it......`
` ......That Dad........."`
`Everyone was stunned by the gold.`
`The first one to break the silence and jump around in ecstasy was Hideyoshi.`
`Letting out an excited laugh, he clung to the wall of gold,`
` and he felt the cold, hard touch of it all over his cheek.`
`"W‐waha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!`
` Th‐this is incredible!`
` It's the real thing!!"`
`"......Ha......ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!`
` Damn you, old man, stockpiling all this gold in a crazy place like this!!"`
`"If we have all this...`
`...there's...`
`nothing to be afraid of anymore...`
` Anything life throws at us,`
` ......we can overcome......!`
` Rosaaa......!!"`
`"Nee‐san...... Nee‐san......`
` We'll be able to find happiness with this, right......?"`
`Eva and Rosa started walking towards each other at the same time and hugged each other as they broke down crying...`
`Ecstasy and shock...wonder and sighs.`
`After stepping forward in front of the pile of gold that caused these mixed emotions,`
` ......Erika spoke as though she were an announcer in some show.`
`".........If money is everything in this world, then this gold is the embodiment of happiness.`
` ......Congratulations, everyone.`
` I pray with all my heart that this discovery enriches your lives."`
`"I take my hat off to you......`
` ......To think that you would solve the epitaph within a single day of coming to this island."`
`".........If it wasn't solvable in a single day, then it wouldn't have been solvable no matter how many days I spent on it.`
` After all, it doesn't take more than an instant for your little gray cells to give you a flash of intuition.`
` ......Also, I wouldn't have been able to solve this riddle on my own.`
` I ask that you praise Battler‐san's achievement as well, everyone."`
`"................................."`
`"......I renounce any rights to this discovery.`
` My reasoning was proven correct, and that alone is enough to satisfy me.`
` Therefore, I want to give Battler‐san the full credit for discovering the gold."`
`"......I may be here, but please continue your discussion as though I am not.`
` Battler‐san called all of the adults here, making sure that none of his cousins would notice.`
` That can only mean one thing.`
` ......He must wish for you all to conduct the true family conference."`
`"......Erika.`
` Quit trying to run the show."`
`"Oh, how rude of me.`
` ............In that case, I'll step down as the facilitator of these proceedings.`
` So, who will take my place?"`
`Shrugging, Erika looked around at everyone.`
`......After a short period of silence, Eva made the first move.`
`"I assume none of us have forgotten......the deal we made earlier today."`
`"Yeah.`
` We divide it between the four of us, 2.5 billion each.`
` And then {i:the successor to the head} gets another 10 billion."`
`".........W‐wait just a moment!`
` Who decided that the one who discovers the gold becomes the successor?!"`
`"Hold your horses, you're not gettin' away with that, Natsuhi‐san...!!`
` That's been the basis of all our talkin' this whole time!`
` Sayin' that now is shameful, don't ya think?!"`
`"...That's right.`
` ......Weren't you the one worrying about how if one of the servants solved the riddle, they might consider themselves the successor to the head...?"`
`"But nowhere is it explicitly written that that's the truth!"`
`"You miserable coward!!!`
` That was the way every single one of us interpreted it!!"`
`"She's right, Aniki!`
` Are you really going to do a 180 on that now?!"`
`"Though it was never written down, I believe it was most definitely common understanding between us.`
` I don't see how you can say it's completely irrelevant."`
`"You can't just interpret the head's epitaph however you like!!`
` Where is it written that the one who finds the gold becomes the successor?!`
` The epitaph was decided upon by the head.`
` You have no right to decide these things for yourselves!!"`
`".........Calm down, Natsuhi."`
`"How can I possibly calm down?!`
` I certainly find it very impressive that Battler‐kun solved the epitaph!`
` I do think it would be fair for him to receive some kind of a reward.`
` However, saying that reward should be half of everything here is clearly over the line,`
` and the argument that the discoverer automatically becomes the successor is one that I absolutely will not permit to go unchallenged...!!"`
`"Th‐that's low, Natsuhi nee‐san...!`
` This is completely different from what you were saying earlier today...!"`
`"I agree!`
` It may not have been written down, but the fact that the guy who solves the epitaph becomes the successor has always been our greatest unwritten assumption...!`
` It's not exactly fair to start complaining about that at the last second, is it?!`
` Yeah, not fair at all!!"`
`"At any rate!!`
` This gold belongs to Father!!`
` We are not to decide how it will be split up without Father's permission!!"`
`"No way!!`
` That's real low, Natsuhi‐san!`
` We were talkin' about this on and on earlier!`
` Are you sayin' that whole conversation today was a bunch of bull?!`
` That's just not right!!"`
`"Why don't we just vote on it?!!`
` Battler‐kun, the one who found the gold, is the successor to the head!`
` My husband and I have no objections!!`
` What about you, Rudolf and Kyrie‐san?`
` Rosa?!"`
`"No objections here. Nice going, Battler!!"`
`"I have no objections either.`
` Battler‐kun is the true successor, chosen by the epitaph.`
` If you aren't satisfied, then why don't we just ask Father directly...?!"`
`"That's right.`
` Like you just said, Natsuhi nee‐san, Father is the one who wrote the riddle of the epitaph.`
` And he's also the proper owner of this gold.`
` In that case, we should raise the matter with him, wouldn't you say?`
` What kind of treatment should Battler‐kun receive as the person who discovered the gold?`
` I believe Father is the only one with the right to determine that...!"`
`"B‐...but......!!"`
`"......I told you to calm down........."`
`"Rosa and Kyrie‐san are right.`
` Let's ask Father!!`
` It's time for you two to step aside!!"`
`"Darn right!!`
` Bring Father down to us!!`
` We won't get anywhere with just you two!`
` Let's get the real family conference started!!`
` You think this looks like somethin' you can put off because he's {i:tired}?!`
` We don't do this properly, an' we'll have a massive problem on our hands...!"`
`"Hey, ya listenin' to me?!!`
` I'm sayin' we're through with you two!!`
` Get off your asses and bring Father down right noooooow!!!"`
`"...............Are family conferences always like this?"`
`"......How the hell'd I know?"`
`"They're probably always feeling like this on the inside.`
` .........Heheheheh.`
` Looks like they won't be able to get this figured out right now without Kinzo‐san."`
`"......To think he's still being called out to settle his children's fights even though he's been told he only has a short while to live.`
` ......I wonder how he feels right about now.`
` ......*giggle*.`
` Imagining that...no, deducing that will be a treat."`
`The parents ignored Battler and Erika and kept yelling at each other, on and on...`
`Even though Battler had more or less imagined that this sort of thing happened behind the scenes, this was the first time he had seen it.`
`He had suspected it since six years ago,`
` and he'd been able to get a pretty good idea of what this was like by the darkening expressions on his parents' faces when this time of year drew near...`
`However, this argument his relatives were having before his very eyes...`
`...was much more...`
`...ugly than he had imagined...`
`He was very glad that he'd called the adults out here without letting the cousins catch wind of anything......`
`Perhaps because everyone was tired out from this seemingly endless argument, they took a short break.`
`It was decided that this family conference inside the Golden Land should be moved over to the mansion...`
`This place may have been gorgeous, like a VIP room, but there was no ventilation, and it was a little cold.`
`It wasn't well suited for a long conversation.`
`They thought of the possibility that someone might carry the gold away while their backs were turned,`
` but it wasn't as if anyone could manage much with just human hands and a small amount of time when they had ten tons of gold to deal with.`
`In fact, it even seemed as though having this mountain of gold in the background was robbing them of the ability to make sound decisions.`
`So they agreed to return to the mansion, in part so that they could regain their composure and continue the conference more ruthlessly......`
`"......Well then, I will retire for the night.`
` ......I imagine I would just get in the way if I remained any longer."`
`"Yeah, sorry about this.`
` Did we bother you too much?"`
`"Please let us show our gratitude again tomorrow.`
` Sorry for letting you see such an embarrassing side of us."`
`"I know you said you were turning it down,`
` but we'll still prepare a fitting share, out of gratitude, for you as one of the first to discover the gold.`
` Right, Nii‐san?"`
`"......Mm.`
` We know what you're capable of.`
` I think you can grasp our current circumstances."`
`20 billion yen in gold wasn't something they wanted out in the open.`
`They didn't want an outsider like Erika telling people about it.`
`Of course, Erika had already "deduced" that much.`
`She wore an unpleasant smile on her face, as though she understood all too well...`
`"......It's quite unnecessary for you to worry about me.`
` I have no intention of telling anyone about this, of course.`
` ......And even if I did, no one would believe me without proof."`
`".........I had the pleasure of witnessing something very interesting tonight.`
` It was truly a feast for the eyes, so let me assure you that I'm more than satisfied."`
`"Heheh, I see.`
` Yes, it's not every day you get to see ten tons of gold."`
`......Getting to see the gold was the feast for the eyes?`
` Of course not.`
`{n}From Erika's dark nature, it was easy to guess what she was so happy about seeing.`
`I thought about telling her to get the hell out of here already, but I wanted out myself...`
`I tried to head back to the guesthouse along with Erika.`
`{n}However, Kyrie‐san grabbed my shoulder.`
`"Not you as well, Battler‐kun.`
` You come with us, please."`
`"Darn right.`
` You're a real successor to the head now!`
` You've gotta go see Father and make it all official...!"`
`"Father is the only one who gets to decide that!!`
` Don't make things up on your own!"`
`"......Battler.`
` I know it's a pain, but you're gonna have to stick around with us for a little while longer.`
` Don't say a word.`
` Just stay quiet and keep your head down.`
` Got it?"`
`"............Just do whatever you want."`
`It would have been easy to say that I had no interest in being successor to the head.`
`......But I was sure that would only add more oil to the fire.`
`Even if I hadn't been ordered to keep quiet, I was certain that staying shut up like a clam was the wisest thing to do...`
`In that case, would it really be so bad if they just let me go back to the guesthouse...?`
`Dad put his arm firmly around my shoulder, and I told him to quit crowding me.`
`But it didn't make any difference...`
`".........We solved the epitaph.`
` Just like you wanted."`
`"................................."`
`"When you were the Game Master, we'd always get those letters.`
` ......‘Try and solve the epitaph.`
` If you don't, I'll kill you all’."`
`"................................."`
`.........Why did she want to make us solve the riddle of the epitaph?`
`By solving it, we found a mountain of gold.`
`{n}Yippee for us.`
`And what about Beato?`
`......Does she gain anything......by having us find the gold?`
`Or does she lose something...?`
`"...As far as chessboard thinking tells us, ......people don't make moves which cause them to lose something.`
` That means you must have something to gain by having us solve the epitaph..."`
`"No.`
` {p:1:This child has nothing to gain from having someone solve the epitaph}."`
`"............Are you sure that's alright?`
` Using the red truth like that without her permission."`
`"......It is what she would want."`
`{f:5:Virgilia}, who had suddenly appeared there, gave me an immediate answer to my question with the red truth...`
`"In the past, I sometimes guessed that the reason Beato was trying to make us solve the epitaph...`
`was that she wanted to make us find the gold's hiding place for her so that she could snatch it away.`
` .........Is that wrong too?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......In the first place,`
` {p:1:the gold of the Golden Land belongs to her from the start}.`
` {p:1:She has absolutely no need to make anyone find it for her or to snatch it away herself}."`
`Of course.`
` ......Beato is {f:5:Beatrice} the Golden.`
`She's the master of the Golden Land and the Ushiromiya family alchemist.`
`{n}...That makes total sense.`
`However, if that's true, that makes me even more confused.`
`......Even if someone exposes the answer to the epitaph's riddle, Beato gains nothing.`
`No, to the contrary, she might get her own gold stolen away.`
`"In that case, I'm understanding this less and less.`
` .........I understand the epitaph murders.`
` It could be revenge against the Ushiromiya family, or else a ritual to revive her powers as a witch.`
` ...She's probably got some reason or goal of her own for it."`
`"................................."`
`"But what's the point of her telling us to solve the epitaph?`
` Whether we solve it or not, she gains nothing.`
` ......In other words, the whole issue of whether the epitaph is solved or not is immaterial in Beato's eyes."`
`"......You could say that.`
` {p:1:Whether the epitaph's riddle is solved or not, she has nothing at all to gain from it}."`
`"It doesn't matter whether it's solved or not.`
` ......Doesn't that mean that the epitaph's riddle {i:itself} has no value to Beato...?"`
`"..................`
` ......I suppose.`
` The epitaph's riddle doesn't have any meaning for her.`
` So even if you take the extreme position that it's immaterial and has no value, it may not be possible to argue against your claim..."`
`"................................."`
`Beato......`
`......Why are you making us solve the riddle of the epitaph...?`
`If we liken the witch you are to a pair of scales, the epitaph murders lie on one plate...`
`And the riddle of the epitaph lies on the other plate.`
`Because she's saying that she'll stop the epitaph murders if the epitaph is solved.`
`......In other words, the epitaph murders and the epitaph's riddle are worth the same to Beato.`
`Like two sides on a balanced scale.`
`That means that the epitaph's riddle and massacring the entire family...`
`have equal significance from Beato's point of view......`
`But {f:5:Virgilia} responded with the red text.`
`{p:1:Regardless of whether the epitaph is solved or not, Beato has nothing to gain}.`
`If she has nothing to gain, then this epitaph's riddle...is meaningless and immaterial to Beato.`
`In that case, how much are the epitaph murders, which lie on the other side of the scales and are equal to the epitaph's riddle in value...`
`......worth to her...?`
`......Think, don't stop thinking......`
`The epitaph murders and solving the riddle of the epitaph have equal worth.`
`As long as the epitaph murders, which are Beato's goal each time, have this single way that they can be stopped, a way that she decided on herself, both are worth the same thing to her.`
`X=Y.`
`{n}And whether the epitaph's riddle is solved or not, Beato gains nothing.`
`{n}Y=0.`
`{n}So, in this case, ......what is X......?`
`"................................."`
`"......Wait a sec.`
` ......That means the epitaph murders are also meaningless and immaterial."`
`"......Beginning with politely sending us an advance notice,`
` she's been willing to spend an incredible amount of effort killing us one by one, following the epitaph's steps in order, without getting exposed,`
` every time she performs that bizarre serial murder.`
` So all of that is meaningless to her...?"`
`I've flipped over the chessboard many times exploring Beato's moves.`
`{n}This was always the first place I stumbled.`
`The significance of the epitaph murders.`
`Why did she have to commit serial murders in a way that reproduced the witch's epitaph?`
`If she wanted to kill the whole Ushiromiya family for revenge, it would be much simpler, safer, and more reliable if she just put poison into their dinner,`
` or else went around killing people one by one in the middle of the night while they were sleeping.`
`However, on the first evening, Beato sends us a letter that sounds like an advance notice,`
` and then carries out what could be broadly described as a three‐part serial murder,`
` killing six people on the first twilight, two on the second, and five on the fourth and later.`
`We aren't fools.`
`Once the first murders occur, we barricade ourselves in somewhere to stave off any further murders.`
`Furthermore, we quickly suspect a culprit among us and start analyzing each other's alibis.`
`As the victims increase, the number of suspects decreases automatically,`
` and Beato's chances of completing the serial murder drop closer and closer to zero...`
`Everything about the epitaph murders......is full of useless ornament and empty decoration...`
`...that only seems to make it harder for her to carry out the serial murder.`
`".........She's raising the difficulty of completing her own objective."`
`"That does follow.`
` ......She's a strange child, isn't she?"`
`"Did you know?`
` In mystery novels, there are sometimes murders that follow the events of a poem or nursery rhyme, just like these epitaph murders.`
` ......I think you can split the reasons these "nursery‐rhyme murders" occur into three major groups."`
`"......And what are those?"`
`"The first would be when it benefits the culprit to follow the epitaph and thereby confuse the evidence and alibis.`
` ......The classic technique of pretending to be dead and mixing yourself in with the victims is an example of this,`
` as is committing murders in an order that doesn't follow the epitaph so that you can cause the others to mistake the order and give yourself an alibi."`
`"I see.`
` So she could make it look as though she was carrying out the murders in accordance with the epitaph, ......when she was actually guiding everyone's thinking in a manner that benefited her.`
` That sounds interesting."`
`".........However, in our games, the dead are truly down for the count thanks to the red.`
` ...She might be able to trick everyone in the world of the game board, but she can't trick us up here in the same way.`
` ......In other words, the most traditional purpose for this kind of murder...isn't what we're dealing with here."`
`"In that case, what are the other two reasons for carrying out a nursery‐rhyme murder?"`
`"One is coincidence.`
` ......The culprit carries out a serial murder which just happens to look similar to the epitaph without being intended to,`
` and the witnesses mistakenly think it's a nursery‐rhyme murder.`
` We humans try to find cause and effect in everything we see.`
` ......If we think we know what something is, then that's how it looks to us."`
`"......I see.`
` That's also interesting.`
` ...However, I'm not sure it's convincing.`
` In this child's games, there's always an advance notice of the crime given before the murders of the first twilight.`
` Also, I believe you find letters and circumstantial evidence one after another that clearly show the culprit is carrying out epitaph murders."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` .........It isn't coincidence.`
` From the very beginning, Beato has been intentionally shoving the epitaph murders in our faces as she carries them out.`
` We aren't just misunderstanding.`
` These murders clearly follow the epitaph.`
` So this can't be the reason either."`
`"In that case, ......it must be your final reason."`
`"The last one.........is to show the murders to someone.`
` In other words, to make them feel fear.`
` ...By following the epitaph, she gives the others clear notice in advance that the murders will continue.`
` The survivors are in constant fear of the murders, which they're certain will continue."`
`"...................................."`
`"In other words,`
` ......this child performed these epitaph murders to create a feeling of mortal terror?"`
`"At least, ...putting it that way, everything makes a surprising amount of sense.`
` ......The grotesque mutilation of the bodies and the disturbing displays were all a show to terrify us......"`
`"To terrify whom......?"`
`"Huh?`
` ......Like I said, us.`
` .............................."`
`After hearing that one line {f:5:Virgilia} spoke so casually, ......my thoughts clouded over once again...`
`Is it really enough...`
`to just use the vague word "us"......?`
`There are a lot of people in the Ushiromiya family.`
`There's the head and the one who holds the rank of his successor...Grandfather and Uncle Krauss.`
`Our parents, who have some pull in the business world.`
`......On the other side, you have the young cousins, who usually visit at most once a year,`
` and the unfortunate servants, who just happened to be on duty.`
`......Even if the culprit hated all of us,`
` ......they probably didn't hate all of us equally.`
`In other words, they might have made it clear which of those among us they particularly wanted to take revenge against and terrify.`
`If we liken this to a kid eating dessert......`
`Isn't the strawberry on top of a shortcake the part you should eat last?`
`No one tells you that you shouldn't eat it first, but our mentality leads us into saving it for later.`
`".........In that case, ...the culprit would want to leave the person they hated most until the end.`
` ......Yeah, similar to what was said by my favorite character in this novel I like.`
` Something about how if you start by killing the people closest to someone, make them feel that sadness, then kill that person last of all,`
` that's the worst way to kill someone."`
`"Oh my, that must have been quite a terrifying novel.`
` How frightening......"`
`"......In that case, you could argue that the people who stay alive until the end are the ones Beato hates the most.`
` ......But the order people are killed in gets totally changed every single time.`
` ......I mean, we all die in the end,`
` but if you go through looking for someone who lives at least until the last twilight every time, there's...`
`.....................`
` ..........................."`
`"...................................."`
`......There's only me.`
`".........Let me first speak with the red.`
` {p:1:Battler‐kun, you are not the culprit}.`
` {p:1:You haven't killed anyone}.`
` {p:1:This can be said of all games}."`
`"Then that.........just makes it even more likely that it's about me.`
` ...It means the sole reason she had for bringing about the epitaph murders...was to show them to me."`
`Beato's always making out that she chooses who to kill next by roulette.`
`But I'm an exception. The only exception.`
` ......Though she does kill me in the end, she always leaves me be until the very last moment.`
`In all of these supposedly random games, there's only this one unchanging constant......`
`"She wants.........revenge? Against me?`
` So is she performing the epitaph murders to make me feel fear...?"`
`"That's wrong.`
` ......{p:1:Her goal is not to make someone experience fear}.`
` {p:1:And it isn't to have revenge on someone either}."`
`"In that case!`
` That means the epitaph murders really don't mean anything to her.`
` The riddle of the epitaph is meaningless, and the corresponding epitaph murders are also meaningless.`
` X=Y=0!`
` But even so, she's clearly trying to show these meaningless things to me!"`
`"What could she want from me...which is worth the same to her as something meaningless?!`
` ......I don't get it!!`
` The more I think about it, the less I understand what she's thinking!"`
`"...................................."`
`{f:5:Beatrice},`
` the fickle witch who committed a meaningless, worthless serial murder.`
`Even the riddle of the epitaph, which she made into a condition to suspend the serial murders,`
` is meaningless, immaterial.`
`And......she's thrusting this meaningless, immaterial thing in front of my face.`
`......What is it......that you want from me...?`
`{n}......Or else, what is it that you want to give me......?`
`My idea that Beato must have been taking revenge on me...has already been refuted in red by {f:5:Virgilia}.`
`Both X and Y...`
`{n}Both the epitaph murders and the epitaph's riddle...mean nothing to Beato.`
`X=Y=0.`
`However, since she's thrusting that in front of me,`
` ...it must...`
`...have some meaning.`
`She presents us a pair of scales representing "if you don't solve the epitaph, I'll carry out the epitaph murders".`
`Neither the epitaph murders nor the epitaph's riddle have any significance by themselves.`
`However, it becomes meaningful when she puts both halves on the scales and thrusts it out before us.........no, before me.`
`......In other words, it should be like this:`
`X=0.`
`{n}Y=0.`
`{n}X+Y>0.`
`A scale with meaningless, weightless things on both sides.`
`{n}However, it has weight itself...and gives the rest meaning.`
`"......It's almost like......playing.`
` Like kids playing rock‐paper‐scissors."`
`Rock‐paper‐scissors is the most immediate method of randomly determining a winner and a loser.`
`You usually bet some sort of privilege on the outcome,`
` ......but kids often do rock‐paper‐scissors just to play, without betting anything in particular.`
`Unless you bet something, nothing but a feeling of joy or disappointment will come from a win or a loss.`
`In other words, the two sides of the scale, winning and losing, are both valueless.`
`However, the very act of seeing which way it will tip...`
`is the reason kids play rock‐paper‐scissors.`
`After all, the kids are enjoying the communication that surrounds the game,`
` ......and they aren't purely interested in the value of winning or losing.`
`They aren't overly concerned about who wins and who loses......`
`"That would mean that it doesn't matter to Beato......whether the epitaph murders succeed or not.`
` ......It almost feels like she's just enjoying the process."`
`"........................"`
`"......In the past, ...I would have cursed her, deciding that she was a heartless witch who kept murdering people for no reason.`
` ......But now, I can't imagine that's true."`
`".........Thank you.`
` In that case, I'll give you one more red.`
` ...{p:1:Beato never committed murder for the sake of pleasure}."`
`She didn't do it for pleasure, and she didn't do it to make anyone feel fear.`
`She has nothing to gain from the epitaph murders,`
` and she doesn't care whether they succeed or fail.`
`It's almost like...a random game kids would play......`
`"No.`
` ......It must have meaning.`
` To her."`
`".........And what is...this meaning...?"`
`"I don't know.`
` Even though neither side of the scale has any value, ......the scale itself has some weight to it in her eyes."`
`......Of course it isn't meaningless.`
` Some meaning definitely exists.`
`In the previous game, she urged me to remember my sin of six years ago.`
`......Was that "meaningless" too?`
`No.`
` There's no way that's the case.`
`I clearly remember the serious look in her eyes at that moment.`
`Unfortunately, I didn't have a clue what she was talking about.`
`{n}......And she was devastated.`
`That's right.`
`At that time, I'm sure she even went so far as to say that the crime wouldn't have occurred if I hadn't come.`
`"There is a meaning.`
` .........A meaning to her.`
` And she wants me to provide it."`
`".........................................."`
`I laughed softly and poked Beato lightly on the head,`
` ......then patted her head.`
`"......Next time you want to send a love letter, I suggest that you just write "I love you".`
` ...If you make it too roundabout and confusing, no one's gonna be able to figure it out."`
`".........*giggle*."`
`"I still don't have a clue what she's thinking.`
` ......But even so,`
` I won't stop thinking.`
` ...I've only just started flipping over the chessboard.`
` ......I definitely won't give up......on this journey through your thoughts."`
