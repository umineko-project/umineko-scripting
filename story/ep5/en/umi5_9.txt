`......The sound of crashing waves.`
`The sound of the tide surging.`
` The noise of the sea breeze.`
`Whenever my headache torments me, these are the sounds that fill my head......`
`My inability to bear a successor placed me in a very difficult position within the Ushiromiya family...`
`I tried every medication that was said to promote fertility, every incense or herb,`
` ......but nothing I tried had any effect.`
`Until I was blessed with Jessica 18 years ago,`
` ......I was ashamed to even call myself a wife.`
`"......The creation of a child depends on the efforts of two people and the whims of heaven.`
` It's not fair to place all the blame on yourself."`
`"I still don't know what caused my inability to become pregnant.`
` I even went to see noted physicians.`
` I underwent humiliating examinations.`
` ......But I was always just told that they didn't understand the reason..."`
`"Even though quite some time had passed since your marriage, you still couldn't bear a child.`
` ......I see.`
` It's only natural that Eva, who secretly aspired to become the next head, would start getting ideas..."`
`Eva tried to convince Father that I was a failure as a future head's wife.`
`It was a time when Kinzo was also very disappointed in my husband's repeated business failures.`
`On the other hand, Eva's husband Hideyoshi's business was growing well, completely the opposite of my husband's business.`
`......He was the only person who could bring Father good news.`
`In that case, perhaps there could be no blame placed on Father if he decided to lend an ear to Eva's words...`
`...or even accept them without question.`
`It was all my fault, because I couldn't bear a child...`
`"You are sinless.`
` Aren't babies of this country carried here by storks?`
` If anyone is to be judged, it should be the stork."`
`"...............Thank you.`
` However, ...even though he was still in good health then, the head was already well past his prime,`
` and it's not hard to imagine that he wanted to see his grandchildren's faces as soon as possible..."`
`"Who cares.`
` If he wanted a grandchild, he could have just done what he wanted with that appalling amount of money he had.`
` ......This is Kinzo, the man who always bragged about how money could create anything.`
` If he wanted a grandchild, why couldn't he just manage something with that money he was so proud of...?!"`
`"..................Yes, ......that's right.`
` ......The head......gave up on me when I couldn't bear a child...`
`...and did just that."`
`......Thinking it the duty of anyone in possession of large amounts of money, the head gave a lot to charities.`
`One among these, the facility known as the "Gospel House", had been given an especially large donation, possibly because he had old ties with that place.`
`"Ah, the Gospel House.`
` ......Furniture came from that place quite often."`
`"As part of their work training and public activity,`
` the head employed Gospel House children with exceptional grades as servants.`
` ......All of the servants in the mansion with the character "{ruby:in/on/non:{p:0:音}}" in their names—Shannon, Kanon, Runon, Manon, Renon, and more besides—`
`were children from there."`
`"......There were quite a lot of them, weren't there...`
` Though most quit after just a few years."`
`"That's probably because a few years of wages from working here would earn them more than enough to live on their own.`
` ......Experience as a servant for the Ushiromiya family is a wonderful thing to add to one's resumé.`
` I'm sure it was also the head's desire for them to gain this for themselves and then spread their wings in society."`
`"............I see.`
` ......So, an adopted child........."`
`".............................."`
`"F‐Father......`
` What......did you just say......?"`
`"Accept this infant as my grandchild."`
`"Ohhh...... There, there.`
` There, there..."`
`Apparently, the baby Kumasawa was trying to soothe didn't like the air in the study at all.`
`...It kept on crying as if it hated it here......`
`"M‐...my apologies, Father...`
` ......I'm not sure what you want me......"`
`"Accept this infant as my grandchild.`
` You shall raise it to be the one who succeeds Krauss."`
`"......In other words, ......you want my husband and I to raise this baby...as our own child......?"`
`"That's right.`
` It's clear by now that you are barren.`
` ......Your body must have some sort of defect."`
`"Ooh... There, there.`
` Ooh, there, there......"`
`As though she couldn't hear our discussion in the slightest, Kumasawa kept on persistently trying to cuddle the baby.`
`This made its crying get even louder......`
`"............That's nonsense.`
` If all the responsibility of giving birth rested with the woman, this world would have no need for men."`
`"I've never forgotten the bitter pain I felt that day......`
` ......Of {i:course} I wanted a child......`
` ......But no matter how much I prayed, I couldn't get pregnant......`
` Thinking that something to do with my body might be the cause, I went to see several famous doctors.`
` But even so, no matter how hard I tried, ......I couldn't become pregnant......"`
`"After all that, ......for this to be how you were treated...`
` ............I understand."`
`The baby had been picked up by the Gospel House just recently.`
`Of course, it wasn't that I didn't feel compassion for the child,`
` who was so young and who had already lost its parents' affection.`
`However, .........the pain and sadness I felt were far greater.`
`It would have been another story if I had suffered to bear this child,`
` ......but why...`
`...did I have to cradle this baby,`
` who not only shared none of my blood,`
` but who was not related to my husband in the slightest either......?`
`"I don't hate Father.`
` ......If anything, ......I only hated my own body...!`
` I detested it!`
` I truly detested my own body for being unable to bear a child......!!`
` So I prayed.`
` I prayed to both angels and demons!!`
` And my wishes were granted by both...!"`
`"......What did you pray to the angels?"`
`"I prayed for a miracle in my body...!`
` If there was something wrong with my body, I could accept that.`
` But I wanted to overcome that defect and somehow be granted the miracle of my husband's child...!"`
`"......That wish came true.`
` ......The next year, you gave birth to Jessica."`
`"And......what did you pray to the demons?"`
`"I couldn't stand it,`
` I couldn't stand it......`
` I cursed this body of mine...!`
` And I cursed this baby,`
` ......who was the living reminder of my failure...!!"`
`".........What did you wish for?"`
`"For the first time in my life, I prayed and wished to demons...!!`
` I wished that this baby would simply disappear!!"`
`......Of course, that wish was also granted...by demons.`
`On that day, I left the baby with one of the older servants and went to think about the future in the rose garden.`
`No, that's a lie.`
` ......I just wanted to clear my mind of everything.`
`The baby's cries were aggravating,`
` so I ordered the servant to take the baby to a place where I couldn't hear.`
`......By a place where I couldn't hear, I meant somewhere far away.`
`Yes, I wished.`
`......I wished for the servant to take the baby far away and never return...!!`
`"I see......`
` ......So, a passing demon heard your wish, Natsuhi‐sama."`
`"And then, ......what happened next?"`
`"After that...was a bizarre accident that could only have been granted me by a demon..."`
`The woodland path from the rose garden to the harbor is certainly well suited for a pleasant walk.`
`......And from time to time, if the mood took you, it would undoubtedly feel good to veer off the path and take a walk through the trees.`
`However, .........wouldn't that be venturing a little too far for a walk with a baby in your arms...?`
`"There was a cliff on the other side.`
` It was......about ten meters high, I think.`
` It was rocky below.`
` ...There was even a fence there!`
` Are we to suppose that the servant deliberately walked all the way over there holding the baby,`
` and then leaned against the fence...?!`
` The only conceivable explanation is that she was lured there by the beckoning of a demon!!"`
`"............So she was lured there.`
` ......A demon who heard your wish lured that servant there......"`
`"So then, ......the servant and the baby..."`
`"They died...!!`
` They fell from the cliff, down to the rocks below...!`
` No, they died because I wished it!`
` That means this is my—"`
`"It isn't your fault!`
` There's no need to think about it any further."`
`"But it happened because I wished it......!!"`
`"No, that's wrong!`
` Making wishes is one thing, but it is only at the whims of gods, demons, and witches that they may be granted!`
` You bear no sin.`
` {y:0:Human}{n:0:Human}s bear no sin.`
` You can even claim that I killed them if you so desire.`
` No, I did kill them!`
` I took pity upon your misery, and I lured the servant with the baby to the cliff and led them down it!"`
`"It was simply an unfortunate accident.`
` If you cannot accept that explanation, then blame it on us.`
` That's why demons exist."`
`".........That's right.`
` We're here for your sake.`
` .....It's not like you killed them.`
` We killed them.`
` So you are sinless.`
` ......So please, don't blame yourself, Natsuhi."`
`"Is that true......?`
` Am I truly sinless......?!"`
`"Yeah, you are.`
` Fuhhahahahaha!!`
` Young one who claims revenge for 19 years ago.`
` If you're going to curse someone, curse me.`
` However, witches have a patent on curses...!`
` Let me take on this fight you're trying to pick with Natsuhi!!"`
`{e:090:I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, {f:5:Beatrice} the Golden}!`
`{e:090:If anyone picks a fight with the master I serve, I will fight in my master's stead}!`
`{e:090:Revenge for 19 years ago, you say}?`
`{e:090:I'll make you learn that's not even a blink of an eye for a witch who's lived a thousand years}!!`
`{e:090:Gahahahahahaahahahahahahahaha}!!`
`{e:090:So, you hate Natsuhi for wishing your death 19 years ago}?!`
`{e:090:Let me make you remember just who it was that lured you off that cliff}...!!`
`......As the middle‐aged female servant cuddled the sobbing baby, she walked on a small path through the trees...`
`Natsuhi had told her that the baby was too loud, so she tried to get as far from the rose garden as she could.`
`......She was completely unaware as to why she'd gone out of her way to head in this direction.`
`However, the sobbing baby...`
`...suddenly stopped crying.`
`Something was reflected in its eyes, but the servant couldn't tell what.`
`However, thinking that the baby had stopped because it had taken an interest in something,`
` ......she headed in the direction of the baby's gaze...`
`The baby had seen......a group of gold butterflies disappearing off into the trees.`
`And.........on the other side of the trees, ...the servant saw a woman.`
`.........Who?`
` It was someone she didn't recognize, someone who couldn't possibly have been there.`
`The baby stopped crying and stared in that direction.`
`{n}...Then, the servant's legs started to automatically carry her that way...`
`"Come this way, woman.`
` .........Bring that cursed baby with you."`
`"...........................Ah......"`
`The woman couldn't disobey.`
`......She was completely overwhelmed by Beato's gold‐glowing eyes...`
`She walked lightly, as though through a dream world.`
`......At some point, the scenery around her had changed,`
` ......but she did not notice.`
` She could not notice...`
`Though this should have been Rokkenjima,`
` ......at some point, it had become the garden of a mansion she had never seen before.`
`It was a garden she had never seen before, even grander than the great rose garden of the Ushiromiya family......a garden of gold roses.`
`There stood an arbor,`
` ......and a woman wearing an elegant dress beckoning her.........`
`...There was a man who looked like a butler, and the tea he poured with a beautiful gesture had a very nice and enticing smell.`
`It was as though they were telling her to join their tea party......`
`She couldn't disobey.`
`.........She had to go to the master of this golden rose garden...`
`......and give this child as an offering......`
`"Forgive me, woman.`
` Curse your bad luck for being entranced by a witch.`
` ......And, surrounded by these gold roses, which you would never be able to enjoy in this world, sleep.`
` .........Gaap."`
`".........Yes, understood."`
`When Gaap snapped her fingers,`
` ......a pitch‐black hole opened at the woman's feet, and she was swallowed up along with the baby.`
`The sight that the woman and the baby witnessed in the very next moment probably burned itself into their eyes forever.`
`The two floated in the air......and looked down at the gold rose garden spread out below them.`
`Below their feet was not the ground, but an unobstructed view of a golden rose garden which stretched as far as the eye could see.`
`If one could have this scene imprinted in their mind as their last memory, that would be such a merciful way to die......`
`Then, the woman and the baby were swallowed up by the golden sea.`
`The {i:thud} was remarkably plain, and remarkably quiet for the sound of two lives being taken.`
`......However, it was a perfect fit for the entertainment at a tea party of witches.`
`Darkness swallowed the woman and the baby, ......and slowly expanded to engulf the entire rose garden...`
`The sound of the wind grew stronger bit by bit.`
`...Was that TV static?`
` What was that noise...?`
`......It was the roar of the sea.`
`The two who had died after falling from a great height into a thicket of golden roses...`
`...were gradually engulfed by the roar of the sea, engulfed by the scenery of the beach below the cliff...`
`"I guarantee it.`
` You are completely sinless!!`
` If someone wants revenge for 19 years ago, they need look no further than me!!`
` Wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"...Ee......eeeeeeeeeeeeekkk.........!"`
`When I spotted the two of them on the rocks below, ......I went pale.`
`Then, I dashed back to the mansion......and there was a great uproar.`
`We urgently rushed them to hospital by boat, ......but from that height, it was a miracle that they had even avoided an instant death.`
`Both the servant...`
`...and the baby...`
`......died.`
`In less than three days from the time Father had entrusted me with the baby, ......I had killed it...!`
`My husband was on a business trip.`
`Rosa‐san, who still lived on the island at the time, was away traveling with her friends.`
`......Father and I were the only ones on Rokkenjima!!`
`And before anyone except Father and I knew,`
` ......a baby had appeared out of nowhere...and then disappeared again!!`
`That's right, it was a dream...a nightmare!!`
`I was convinced that Father would blame me.`
`...However, his reaction was somehow strange...!`
`"Heh, ......heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh, fwaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahha{0}hhahaha!!`
` I saw this coming, I {i:knew} this would happen!`
` How long must you struggle?`
` To what lengths will you go to escape being mine?!!`
` Waha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!`
` I have no interest in an empty cage!`
` Throw it away!!"`
`When Father learned of the accident,`
` he kept on laughing and laughing, as though nothing could be more amusing, to the point that just listening to him disturbed me.`
`Perhaps something had come loose in his mind......`
`That was the day that changed him.`
`Father shut himself up inside the world of the occult even more than he ever had before......`
`When my husband came back, he was astonished to see how eccentric Father had now become.`
`However, ......he had already accepted that this would happen sooner or later.`
`Of course, my husband had heard about the baby.`
`However, he told me that it was surely just some whim of Father's, and to forget the whole episode.`
`So I forgot it!`
`It was an unfortunate accident.`
`No, there wasn't an accident at all!`
`I forgot everything, even that the baby had existed in the first place...!!`
`After all, it was a twisted nightmare which lasted not even three days!`
`{n}That's right, it was all a nightmare...!!`
`I don't want to remember any of it!!`
`The cliff, the broken fence, the roar of the sea,`
` and......the wailing of that baby.........!!!`
`"So, that baby.........is the baby of 19 years ago?"`
`"Of course not!`
` I killed that baby!`
` It no longer exists in this world!"`
`"......However, there is no red truth in the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world.`
` In the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world, nothing can be trusted."`
`"............That's right.`
` Beato, you definitely killed that baby.`
` But in the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world, it might still be considered alive.`
` ......Whether {i:it's really alive or not}, catch my drift?"`
`"Are you saying.........that it actually was alive?!`
` After falling to the rocks from that height......?!"`
`"I don't know.`
` But calm down.`
` ......No matter how much that person hates you, the truth is that it was an accident.`
` If he does hate you, that hatred is completely unjustified...!"`
`"But, but...!`
` Even if I didn't lay a finger on him, ......inside my heart, I...!!"`
`"Calm down.`
` ......No matter who the man from 19 years ago hates or what he yells, there's no way the sin he's after actually occurred.`
` So calm down.`
` Why don't I welcome the man from 19 years ago as my guest?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"And just when the riddle was solved and I thought my job was finished.`
` I've got to entertain this final guest of mine!!`
` Kuhhya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya!!"`
`"It's getting interesting.`
` ......Not only are you protecting Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}'s secret, but you also have a 19th guest and a man from 19 years ago."`
`".........That's right—to us who claim that Kinzo is alive, Erika is number 19.`
` And in addition to that 19th piece, we have a man from 19 years ago?`
` How interesting. I'm getting all excited."`
`"We have no lack of opponents!!`
` And I was just thinking it a shame to have only one guest at my tea party!!`
` Come, you fools!!`
` Kuhha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}hahah!!"`
`Furudo Erika is Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}'s piece.`
`{n}In that case, whose piece is the man from 19 years ago......?`
`The voice which could be faintly overheard through the receiver...was Natsuhi's.`
`"I, ......I understand.`
` I'll sleep right now.`
` I won't leave my room, and I won't pick up the phone...!`
` So please, don't tell my husband and daughter......!"`
`When heard through a receiver, even these begging screams which would have shaken the heart of anyone who heard them...`
`......could be listened to with a heart of ice...`
`"As long as you keep our promise, I'll keep your secret, Mother.`
` ......Don't break our promise.`
` .........I'm already very close by.`
` I can easily tell whether you've turned your lights off and whether you're on the phone.`
` ...If I wished to, I could even kiss your sleeping face."`
`"I'll keep it!`
` I'll keep my promise!!`
` So stop it, just stop it!`
` Stop iiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iittt!!"`
`The receiver was set down violently.`
`......“He” knew very well how bad an aftertaste you could leave for the other side just by the way you hung up the phone...`
`"Okay, good night, Mother.`
` ............And there you go!`
` Now Natsuhi won't come out of her room tonight."`
`".........That's a clever trick.`
` You can change your voice?"`
`"*giggle*!`
` Anyone can change their voice.`
` A sweet voice when begging Papa for a favor{p:0:♪}`
` A hoarse‐sounding voice when taking the day off school.`
` An apologetic voice when turning down a friend that you actually hate!`
` {f:5:If you want}{p:0:♪},`
` {p:0:I can do~}`
` {p:0:{nobr:ａｎｙ} {nobr:ｖｏｉｃｅ☆}}`
` at all~!"`
`".........You should stop being a witch and become a voice actress."`
`"Heheheheheheheh!`
` So, are all the pieces set up for both of us now?`
`............‘Furudo Erika’.`
` What a wonderful piece.`
` She suits you so much more than Ange did, Bern."`
`"............Your praise honors me, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}."`
`"The pleasure is mine.`
` ......Mmm, she really is wonderful.`
` Super adorable.`
` I'm dying to break her spirit with my witch illusions and see her face twist in humiliation."`
`"......Hear that?`
` ......Don't embarrass me, okay?`
` Show me that you're a much more useful piece than Ange was."`
`"Yes, leave it to me.`
` Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, my master.`
` ......I'm nothing like that gloomy, dull, utterly charmless piece."`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*!`
` She's so right.`
` The only useful thing that Ange did was get turned into meat chunks to fire Battler up!"`
`"We have no interest at all in family love or sibling love!`
` The game we want to see is more gruesome and sticky!`
` A <grotesque>, <pop>, and <cute> murder case!!"`
`".........If Natsuhi is the king, then I wonder if Beato is the queen.`
` *giggle*.`
` The pack of witches and furniture guarding Natsuhi is less like a set of chess pieces and more like—"`
`"Bowling pins, right?!`
` Kyahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!`
` Illusions of Natsuhi and Beato,`
` Kinzo and the worthless furniture!`
` Entertain us a bit, will you?!"`
`"Especially Beato!`
` We're bored of you now!`
` That "Legend of the Witch" murder game of yours is over!`
` And your time is up too!!"`
`"This game board is Bern's and mine now.`
` It'll suit you to be reduced to one of our pieces and toyed with for all eternity!!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*.`
` Both Natsuhi and Beato are sacks of filthy, rotten truth, just entrails wrapped up in a thin layer of skin.`
` ......Tearing that to shreds and dragging the insides out will be one of my—`
`no, one of {i:our} few pleasures."`
`"Yes, you can have a lot of fun with it.`
` Hey, are you watching?`
` {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` Look at how much fun can be had playing with your board.`
` I'll show you.`
` A fifth game that's actually fun!!"`
`".........It's a bit sad if we're the only ones having a pleasant chat.`
` Why don't you let Beato talk too?"`
`"Hear that?`
` I'll give you special permission to talk.`
` What do you hope to gain from this latest game?!"`
`"......................................."`
`"Ahahahaha!`
` Nothing, she says!`
` That's right, that's right!`
` You're the loser who got crushed by Battler!`
` Leave it to me, okay?`
` I'll put the witch side on top in a snap!`
` But I'm gonna be sacrificing you as a piece in the process!!"`
`"What a dreadful loss of face for {f:5:Beatrice}, keeper of the gold, to have her epitaph so easily solved before the first twilight.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"......Isn't it great that you've been left as a piece as part of Natsuhi's fantasy?`
` ......Well, except that we're treating you as a pin now instead of a piece."`
`"The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} is out of the picture now!`
` In my game, you and your furniture only have a teeny‐tiny role, a loser's role!!`
` You can enjoy getting tossed and thrown around and made into toys for me and Bern!!"`
`".........If that's not what you want, just tell us to stop.`
` And we'll stop."`
`"......................................."`
`"She doesn't mind!`
` *giggle*giggle*!!`
` Pin confirmed!!"`
`"Ahhahaha...ahhahahahahaha!"`
`""Kyahhha{0}hah{0}hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}hha{0}ha{0}hah{0}gwa{0}hyah{0}haha{0}aah!!!""`
`There's no need for a Golden Witch anymore.`
`All that's needed is a sacrificial doll so that we two witches can enjoy some time playing.`
`Die, die, disappear.`
`Confess to your filthy past and your crimes,`
` pour out your sob story of regret and repentance as you throw yourself off a cliff and die!!`
`There will be no more appearances for the Golden Witch......!!`
`Ahhah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haah{0}hah{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!!`
`"......................................."`
`"...............Beato..."`
`This will be......a most horrible game.`
`On the surface, it does look very similar to the usual tales.`
`However, ......there is no respect given to the true main characters of this tale.`
`This is supposed to be the tale to which the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} invited Ushiromiya Battler.`
`However, the host has been lost, and there is no longer a guest.`
`{n}......With both inviter and invitee now gone, only the worst kind of tale remains.`
`{a:c:Welcome to the fifth game:`
`{n}End of the Golden Witch.`
`{n}Welcome to a party with neither host nor guests,{nobr: hijacked by wicked witches......}}`
`".........Ready, Battler?`
` The second day is about to start.`
` Heheheheh! I hate Beato's kind of slow, plodding storytelling!"`
`"Do your worst.`
` ......No matter how much you mess things up, I'm still gonna reach the truth of this game."`
`"*giggle*.`
` .........As you must.`
` For the sake of your little sister, if nothing else."`
`".............................."`
`"Don't worry.`
` ......Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} may be a far more terrifying opponent than that fool {f:5:Beatrice},`
` but I'll be giving you plenty of support, so there won't be any problems.`
` ......Let's work together, and this time we'll expose the witch illusions for what they really are."`
`".........I don't give a damn about you.`
` I won't accept anything or anyone that wasn't a part of Beato's games, and I don't need your help."`
`"Is now really the time to act tough?`
` .........Oh well, let's both give it our all, okay?`
` Together, let's tear the witch illusions to shreds.`
` *giggle*giggle*!"`
`Erika brazenly put her hand out for me to shake.`
`...Instead of just passively ignoring this,`
` I gave her an active and clear answer by knocking her hand aside.`
`".........*giggle*.`
` Looks like he hates shaking hands.`
` Just like Ange."`
`"Don't worry.`
` I'm a far more useful piece than Ange.`
` ......I'm nothing at all like shredded meat that couldn't accomplish anything besides restoring Battler‐san's fighting spirit."`
`"..........................."`
`"*giggle*...!`
` Isn't it great that you've been blessed with such helpful‐looking allies?!`
` In the past, it was {f:5:Virgilia} and Ronove.`
` Then Ange came as well."`
`"And now you have Bern and Erika!`
` There are so many pieces supporting you!`
` And despite all of that, you still can't get even a glimpse of the truth! How does it feel to be that incompetent?! How does it feel?!"`
`".........It doesn't matter.`
` This battle is between me and Beato.`
` Everyone else besides us...doesn't matter."`
`"Oh, is that true?`
` Are you finally standing on your own?!`
` You've always had someone helping you or showing you mercy, so I wonder just how far you'll get on your own!`
` I'm gonna enjoy watching this!"`
`"......I'm taking it back.`
` .........This is our game.`
` ......You two aren't invited!!"`
`"*giggle*.`
` Yes, that's true.`
` .........This is your game.`
