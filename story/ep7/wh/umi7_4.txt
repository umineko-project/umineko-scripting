`"Step it up!! `
`What are you doing, slacking off when the fighting's so close?!" `
`Stars seemed to spin around inside my head. `
`I could just lie down on the floor, but that'd only make him more angry. `
`I've got no intention of being obedient. `
`...Still, it'd be stupid to get myself punched for no reason, so I got up and stood at attention... `
`"............" `
`The fighting's close, is it? `
`You really think the American troops are likely to show up on this forgotten island? `
`Then let them come right now. `
`That's what I've been waiting for all this time. `
`"What's this cowardly look you're wearing?! `
`Is this how afraid you are of death?! `
`Are you so scared of those Americans?! `
`You won't be killin' any of them with an attitude like that!!" `
`"............" `
`I got hit again. `
`...Could you please quit your whining already? `
`Filthy cowards. `
`They let themselves be controlled by this inexplicable anger because it's the only way to distract themselves from their own fear. `
`Heart and spirit aren't of any use when the battle becomes hopeless. `
`When trapped by an insurmountable hopelessness, humans tend to rely on several other emotions to escape their fear. `
`For these young, inexperienced soldiers, anger was a very convenient emotion to fall back upon. `
`Anger is the wine they used to paralyze their fear. `
`It made them chant "damn the British, damn the Americans" as they swung their bamboo spears around and called it "drilling". `
`The more wine you drink, the more you need to drink to get drunk. `
`Their useless anger continued to pile up, day after day, without pause. `
`I...did not fear death. `
`So, I had no need of the wine called anger. `
`This made their cowardice all the more apparent to me. `
`"What's that look on your face?! `
`Ushiromiya, you've lost your nerve down to your very soul!! `
`You're a fish, that's what you are. `
`You've got the eyes of a dead fish!!" `
`However, it went both ways. `
`Just as I was able to spot their cowardice... `
`They were able to pick up on my lethargy. `
`"Is Ushiromiya Kinzo here?! `
`The lieutenant's looking for you!" `
`"Stand up! `
`No slouching about! `
`Double tiiiiime!!" `
`First Lieutenant Yamamoto was the commanding officer in charge of the Rokkenjima garrison. `
`He was just another filthy coward trying to forget his fear with violence, `
`and would often reprimand his subordinates for slacking off at the drop of a hat. `
`Whenever he was in a good mood and started spouting off stories of his life, they were all about how much of a thug he had been, ignoring the rules of society. `
`On and on about how so-and-so was a prick, so he taught him a lesson, or how everyone was so scared of him that he got special treatment. `
`...He kept on talking about what a vile human he was as though it was a badge of honor. `
`Normally, I had nothing to do with this lieutenant who I couldn't respect in any way. `
`He'd always hang around with his non-commissioned subordinates, `
`so as long as I treated him with a snappy salute, I could more or less ignore him for the time being. `
`Now that the construction project on this island has been suspended indefinitely, there's no longer any use for an engineer like me. `
`So, why did the lieutenant ask to see me specifically? `
`At that moment, I couldn't think of anything... `
`"Ah, Ushiromiya! `
`I hear you're good with foreign languages! Is that true?" `
`"I am proficient in both English and Chinese, sir." `
`The lieutenant liked to brag about his education in front of the non-commissioned officers, `
`but he held a bit of a grudge against me for being even more highly educated than him. `
`Since he also felt uncomfortable about having a subordinate who was older than him, `
`I wasn't exactly the type he'd be willing to confide in. `
`Just the fact that I knew several languages must've hurt his pride. `
`"What about Italian?" `
`"I don't speak that." `
`"So, you wouldn't be much help as an interpreter between me and an Italian person, would you?" `
`"It should be possible if they can speak English as well." `
`"...Ah, yes, very true! `
`Have you ever talked with a foreigner in English?!" `
`"I have." `
`Why on earth would he need an interpreter in a cave on an uninhabited island that even our superiors forgot about? `
`His question made it clear that some guest had arrived on Rokkenjima who would need an interpreter. `
`"Good! `
`Ushiromiya, you'll be my interpreter. That's an order!" `
`That evening, I found out exactly what he was talking about. `
`That pointless submarine dock in the cavern that had never been used... `
`was now being approached slowly by a submarine of the Italian Navy. `
`Of course, I knew that the Italians were our allies. `
`However, this was the first time I'd seen anything from their military with my own eyes. `
`"What was the Italian Navy doing here...? `
`Didn't Italy surrender in 1943? `
`What's going on...?" `
`"It was the Kingdom of Italy that surrendered. `
`...However, those who couldn't accept that surrender joined Mussolini and formed the RSI, so that they could continue fighting." `
`"The RSI?" `
`"The Italian Social Republic. `
`Also known as the Salo Republic." `
`"You know your history. `
`...The ignorant often call the Italians cowards, saying that they surrendered first of the Axis powers in 1943. `
`That's not true. `
`The military of the Italian Social Republic fought bravely from the outbreak of war until April 29, 1945." `
`"And Berlin fell just three days after that. `
`Far from being cowards, they gave one hell of a fight. `
`...Still, I'm surprised the RSI Navy even had possession of a submarine that could travel all the way to Japan." `
`"...Even if they did, it's a surprise that they'd come out this far at all. `
`...Why would they come to Japan? `
`To Rokkenjima?" `
`The submarine was both weather-worn and massive. `
`I doubt anyone had even imagined that a foreign submarine would come all the way out here, `
`...when we never even had one of our own submarines dock. `
`All of the guards on Rokkenjima, of which there were only about 30, stood at attention as the submarine docked. `
`"...Never seen the Italian military before..." `
`"I heard a mine or some accident trashed their sub." `
`"From what I heard, it sounds like their ventilator broke down and the cabin got packed with chlorine gas." `
`"The Lieutenant was hinting about there being something veeery important in there..." `
`"You mean like a code machine or the blueprints for some new kind of engine?" `
`"I couldn't care less what they're carrying. I'm more surprised that the higher-ups still remember we exist..." `
`"Hurry up, Ushiromiya!! `
`How are you supposed to interpret from over there?!!" `
`"Yes, sir..." `
`On top of the hatch was a young Italian saluting us. `
`...Normally, this should have been the job of a commissioned officer, but his clothes looked like those of a sailor, `
`and it really didn't look like he had the dignity and composure of a ship's captain. `
`That probably meant that all of the commissioned officers in charge had died in the accident that had befallen this sub. `
`Crew members crawled out of the hatch one by one, but they all looked pale and entirely worn out. `
`I'm not sure how long ago the accident happened, `
`but being crammed together in a tiny sub filled with chlorine gas for any amount of time can't be good for your health. `
`Not only had the ventilators broken, but traveling about carelessly on the surface of the waters around Japan these days would be foolish in the extreme. `
`...It had been like a trip inside a can of poison gas. `
`Almost all of them were unable to walk without leaning on someone else. It looked like a bunch of people staggering out of a hospital boat. `
`"Ushiromiya! `
`Ask them who the captain is! `
`Tell them that I'm in charge of this island!" `
`"<...Welcome to Japan. `
`Do any of you speak English?>" `
`The crew members seemed to understand that I was speaking English, but it looked as though none of them could speak it. `
`Eventually, someone who seemed to be dressed as an officer saluted. `
`"<Welcome to Japan. `
`Are you the captain?>" `
`"<I cannot speak English>... `
`<Please, wait.>" `
`The officer answered in slow, laborious English. `
`...After asking us to wait, he shouted something to his subordinates in rapid Italian. `
`It looked as though he was telling them to get someone among them who could speak English. `
`"Ushiromiya, what're they talking about?!" `
`"They've asked us to wait. `
`They might be looking for someone there who can speak English." `
`At that moment, I heard a high-pitched cough. `
`It wasn't a man's cough. `
`...It was a woman's. `
`"<I speak English.>" `
`As she came down from the hatch, ...a woman with beautiful golden hair said this in English. `
`In this filthy cavern, `
`the appearance of one as beautiful as she was seemed like an angel descending upon us... `
`"<Welcome to Japan. `
`Is the captain there?>" `
`"<The captain is dead. `
`That man over there is the only officer left.>" `
`"<My condolences. `
`Can we do anything to assist you?>" `
`"<We'd like some fresh air and water. `
`Some of us are still having trouble breathing. `
`And we'd like a place to rest.>" `
`"<We would be happy to help. `
`Do any of the others understand English?>" `
`"<The ones who did are all dead. `
`I'm the only one left.>" `
`"Ushiromiya! What's that woman talking about?! `
`Who's the captain? That man from a second ago?! `
`Who is that woman?! Get translating already goddammit!!" `
`The lieutenant has been yelling like that for a while now. `
`...He must've been surprised to see such a beautiful woman appear from a submarine... `
`and more than a little annoyed to see all of her attention focused on me alone. `
`It was a mark...of how divinely beautiful she was. `
`"Sir, `
`it seems that she's the only one who understands English. `
`She will act as their interpreter. `
`Their captain is dead. `
`That officer seems to be acting in his place." `
`"<Who's that loud man who keeps yelling at you? `
`Don't tell me he's your superior.>" `
`"<Unfortunately, he is. `
`He probably doesn't like seeing me have such a beautiful lady all to myself.>" `
`"<Oh? `
`I didn't expect flattery from an Asian. `
`Your English is superb. `
`I imagine you've been brought up very well. `
`Unlike that rude man who keeps on shouting. `
`They should've made you the officer in charge around here.>" `
`"<Oh? `
`And I never expected flattery from a Westerner.>" `
`"<*giggle*! `
`You're an interesting man. `
`What's your name?>" `
`"<Ushiromiya...Kinzo. `
`If you don't mind, may I ask for your name as well?>" `
`"<Beatrice Castiglioni.>" `
`"<Welcome, Beatrice. `
`Welcome to Japan.>" `
`That was when I first met Beatrice, the woman who would capture my heart for the rest of my life... `
`"...So, Beatrice was an Italian." `
`"Yes. `
`She was the daughter of a high-ranking RSI official. `
`Apparently, their most important cargo was her father himself. `
`...Sadly, he had already died by the time they reached Rokkenjima." `
`"Why would a high official like that come to Japan? `
`You're saying he went through the Suez Canal and crossed the Indian Ocean to come all the way here?" `
`"That's a good point. `
`If they wanted to reach one of their allies, Germany should have been much closer. `
`...So, why would they make the long trip to Japan?" `
`"......It may have been part of some grand, outrageous strategy. `
`...I don't know all the details, `
`but shortly after, I learned that this submarine's mission was far from a minor one..." `
`They said that there had been about 60 of them at the time of their departure. `
`However, only about 10 of them, including Beatrice, had survived. `
`Their submarine had apparently hit a mine or something in the nearby waters and sustained a great deal of damage. `
`They told us that it had flooded rapidly with water, which had taken out the batteries and released a large amount of chlorine gas. `
`Their sub had become completely incapable of continuing further, `
`nothing but a massive lump of metal floating by the dock. `
`Since the sub seemed to be carrying "something of immense value", `
`the higher-ups ordered us to investigate. `
`After questioning the Italians, with Beatrice and me acting as double interpreters, `
`we concluded that this thing of immense value must have been her father himself. `
`Apparently, Beatrice's father was extremely high up in the RSI hierarchy, `
`and it was thought that he might have worked alongside Mussolini himself. `
`Though their massive voyage had apparently been part of some top-secret mission, `
`now that the man himself and all of the commissioned officers had died, their reason for coming to Japan remained a mystery. `
`And, our higher-ups were telling us to investigate, which meant that even they didn't know what it was. `
`Their ship had broken down, their mission was unknown, and the high official they had been carrying was dead. `
`And even the Japanese government didn't know why they were here. `
`...The Italians' great and perilous voyage... `
`had come to a meaningless and utterly fruitless end... `
`"<That's a relief. `
`I always assumed the seas of Japan would smell like soy sauce.>" `
`"<What a coincidence. `
`I've always thought Italians had hair made of pasta.>" `
`"<Of course we do. `
`You don't know how hard it is to get that perfect al dente texture. `
`I imagine you Japanese all wear spaghetti al nero?>" `
`"<I see you've done your homework. `
`In Japan, we use squid ink instead of shampoo.>" `
`"<Kyahaha! `
`You really are amazing, Kinzo. `
`It seems you know everything! `
`Have you ever been to Italy?>" `
`"<Never. `
`I have read a lot of books though.>" `
`"<An Asian man reading Italian books?! `
`Wow, what kinds of books?>" `
`"<Niccolo Machiavelli. `
`And Dante Alighieri. `
`So I know, of course, that you're the eternal lady.>" `
`"<Oh, what a surprise... `
`You must be quite the bookworm. `
`Does this mean you came from some Japanese noble family?>" `
`"<......Who knows?>" `
`"<You're completely different from those other savage-looking Japanese soldiers. `
`I can tell! `
`You must've come from a noble family. `
`Are the Ushiromiyas some sort of Japanese aristocrats?>" `
`"<...Of course not. `
`They just managed to strike it rich in the spinning industry in recent generations. `
`I didn't study all that as part of some noble's hobby. `
`...I just did it because I wasn't allowed to do anything except read, `
`play around with roses, `
`and get myself drunk.>" `
`There had been no trace of malice in Beatrice's words. `
`It had just been a curious question asked to a friend from a faraway country. `
`However, ...Beatrice was from a noble family herself, so she could tell. `
`...She could see the faint gloomy look on Kinzo's face. `
`"<Forgive me, Kinzo. `
`I didn't stop to consider why a high-class person like you `
`would choose to take the position of a common soldier.>" `
`"<I...don't give a damn about my family line. `
`When I die, the name Ushiromiya will have no hold on me. `
`Then, I'll finally be free.>" `
`"<......So, you joined the army because you wanted to die? `
`You mustn't do that. `
`Your family would be so sad.>" `
`"<Family? `
`...I have no family.>" `
`I have a wife for the sake of public appearances...and children. `
`However, I've never wanted any of them. `
`...Everything, everything...is a fleeting daydream created by those selfish, greedy elders. `
`...So, at least while I'm on this island, I can forget about all of that...and find some peace. `
`Peace...? `
`But haven't I spent each and every day complaining that I wasn't sent to the front and haven't managed to die yet...? `
`"<...I can't understand the pain you're going through, but I do realize that my thoughtless words have hurt you. `
`Forgive me, Kinzo.>" `
`Forgive me, Kinzo. `
`Yes, those words are probably what did it. `
`All of the Japanese called me Ushiromiya. `
`...It reminded me that I was the property of the Ushiromiya family every time they talked to me. `
`But she was different. `
`She...called me Kinzo. `
`Not Ushiromiya. `
`So maybe, ...just for the time I chat with her like this, `
`...I can forget that cursed family. `
`"<......Kinzo.>" `
`I hadn't meant to make Beatrice feel guilty, `
`but she seemed certain that her thoughtless words had hurt me. `
`"<Thank you.>" `
`"<Huh?>" `
`"<Since you always call me Kinzo, I finally feel like I'm my own man. `
`...I think...that I've finally met a person who truly sees me for who I am.>" `
`"<Kinzo, `
`you may be a foreigner I met in a distant land, `
`...but I can tell that your heart is sensitive and beautiful. `
`If we had grown up in the same neighborhood, I'm sure we would've become fast friends. `
`...I'm happy too. `
`You always call me Beatrice. `
`Not "the daughter of the Castiglioni family".>" `
`We were both in the same position. `
`Her Castiglioni family must have been a rigid place as well. `
`...Though we came from different countries, we had finally found something that we both understood. `
`"<Do you have a nickname that people close to you use?>" `
`"<No. `
`They usually just called me Kinzo.>" `
`"<Well then, you should stop calling me Beatrice. `
`All of my close friends used to call me Bice. `
`I'd like you to call me that too.>" `
`"<Very well. `
`From this point onwards, allow me to call you Bice as a sign of our friendship.>" `
`"<Ah, come on. `
`Don't be all stiff like that. `
`We're already friends, okay?>" `
`A bright smile stretched across Beatrice's face... `
`"No matter how many decades pass, `
`...that smile will never fade from my memory..." `
`"...So, by meeting Beatrice, you managed to regain your sense of self." `
`"Or, as most people would put it, he cheated on his wife. `
`...Nggyaaaahh, ggrrrrkkk..." `
`"If you plan to continue being rude, I suggest you get in the habit of covering your butt." `
`After having his butt pinched once more, Will hopped around in pathetic agony... `
`"So in your eyes, Grandfather, `
`Rokkenjima was always special because you first met Beatrice here." `
`"...Indeed. `
`...If I had never come to this island, I would never have met her. It truly is an island of miracles..." `
`"Is there anything left of that submarine base today?" `
`"Yes, it's still there, near Kuwadorian. `
`It's in the shadows of a cove that can't be seen from the outside. `
`After all, fishermen never approach this supposedly ill-omened island. `
`It's unlikely that anyone besides me still knows of its existence." `
`"Is the two-kilometer-long underground passage between Kuwadorian and the mansion a remnant of that base?" `
`"That is correct. `
`There was some nonsense about fortifying several locations across the island and connecting them with tunnels carved out of limestone caverns. `
`I made use of that underground passage and built two mansions, `
`one at each end of the island." `
`"Two mansions, two families. `
`...The Ushiromiya family mansion...and a mansion for the Kinzo released from the shackles of the family." `
`"......Correct. `
`...It was something I needed. `
`...Another place for me to escape from the cursed name of Ushiromiya." `
`"............" `
`"<Still, I do feel bad for you. `
`It must be awful to have come all the way out here and be unable to fulfill your mission.>" `
`"<I don't really know what Papa's plan was. `
`He said we needed to run far away to hide "it" until the time came.>" `
`"<And what is "it"?>" `
`"<I don't know. `
`..."It" was something very important, `
`and he planned to hide it for many years until the right moment. `
`Oh, and he planned to hide himself along with it. `
`I know because he apologized to me for sending us to live a long time on foreign soil.>" `
`"<Didn't that second lieutenant of yours say that you had no cargo in particular, `
`and that you were transporting your father instead?>" `
`"<Lieutenant Angelo doesn't trust you or the others. `
`Even I know a few things he's kept hidden from you. `
`...He might even know what Papa's goal was...and what the cargo is.>" `
`"<Whatever it is, that's a mission for the Italian military. `
`It has nothing to do with us. `
`After all, we're allies. `
`We should be able to trust each other.>" `
`"<I have no doubts that you're a good person, Kinzo. `
`I even told Lieutenant Angelo that you're a man we can trust, but... `
`...Why is it that men always get so rigid and uptight when they're in a strange land? `
`Normally, they're all very bright and cheery people. `
`Ever since we came here, there's been this strange feeling of tension. `
`...Lieutenant Angelo has ordered that his subordinates be armed at all times. `
`It's almost as though we're in enemy territory.>" `
`That was true. `
`The Italians were clearly the very opposite of relaxed. `
`The Japanese soldiers, watching this, began to suspect that the Italians didn't really trust them at all. `
`"<That's normal for a soldier. `
`This is precisely the time for them to straighten up their guard, so they don't embarrass themselves in front of a friendly army.>" `
`"<They have a person stand watch every time they sleep, `
`and they're still keeping a lookout to make sure none of you approach the submarine, even though it's nothing more than an unusable scrap heap now. `
`It almost feels as though they're clearly prejudiced against the Japanese, and that bothers me.>" `
`True, they had set up a constant sentry by the submarine and had refused to let any of the Japanese soldiers come near. `
`This hadn't made the Japanese particularly happy. `
`...However, submarines are treated as classified in all countries. `
`Maybe it was just natural for them to stop foreigners from approaching it without reason. `
`"<They're probably uncomfortable with being made to live in a way they aren't used to. `
`...The boat that's supposed to take you back to the mainland is still being delayed by weather and problems up the command chain. `
`Just how long will it take before they can send you there...>" `
`We had been told that a boat was being sent for them directly from the mainland, `
`but apparently, thanks to the weather, problems up the command chain, and the recent air raids, `
`they had no ships they could spare on a forgotten island like this. `
`There may have been political issues as well. `
`...After all, the Italians' homeland had already surrendered to the Allies. `
`...I didn't know the details. `
`The only thing I knew for sure... `
`was that they'd been stuck on Rokkenjima for two whole weeks, and no one had come to get them. `
`Of course, we had some small boats on Rokkenjima. `
`There was nothing physically stopping us from taking them to a nearby island. `
`Still, Rokkenjima was technically a top-secret base, and contact with the outside world had been strictly forbidden... `
`"<Well, there's nothing we can do about it, and it isn't all that bad, really. `
`After all, if a boat did come for us, I'd probably never see you again, Kinzo.>" `
`"<...True.>" `
`To me, those two weeks...were the first I'd ever truly lived. `
`The faint 20 years before all seemed to vanish in the sparkle of that pair of weeks. `
`...I realized that she'd have to leave this place eventually. `
`And yet, this single moment felt so rich and dazzling...... `
`that I felt myself wishing it could last forever... `
`Then, I heard a voice calling for Beatrice in Italian. `
`"<...It's Lieutenant Angelo. `
`Looks like he wants you for something.>" `
`"<Probably to scold me. `
`These days, he keeps yapping on about how I shouldn't get too friendly with the Japanese soldiers.>" `
`The second lieutenant approached, saluting Kinzo, `
`and after glancing at Beatrice as though asking her to translate something, he began to speak in Italian. `
`Judging by his tone, it sounded like something serious. `
`"<...Lieutenant Angelo has something very important to say, so he wants to talk with your commanding officer. `
`...He wants your help with something. `
`I don't know what.>" `
`"<Something important...? `
`Got it. `
`I'll go find Lieutenant Yamamoto.>" `
`Lieutenant Angelo had two of his subordinates with him and wore a stern expression on his face. `
`They didn't have to say anything...for us to realize that this had to be something very serious... `
`"That's it!! `
`Lift it up!!" `
`The winch creaked and the thick chains rang out with a dull clang. `
`Very, very slowly, ..."it" was lifted up out of the submarine's cargo hold. `
`"...Now I get it! `
`...So this is why those Italians didn't want us near their sub...!" `
`The first lieutenant and the others looked up at what the winch was slowly lifting up, `
`...all of them wearing unpleasant, forced smiles... `
`"<......Unbelievable... `
`...So this is what Papa brought all this way...?>" `
`"<...I-Incredible... `
`...I've never seen anything like this...>" `
`It was...a mountain of gold ingots. `
`Those carefully-piled bars were being slowly lifted out of the cargo hold, one group after another... `
`This gold had been their true cargo. `
`I don't know where they were planning to take it. `
`They might've been trying to sneak it into Japan, one of their allies, `
`...or they might've been on their way to hide it in some remote area. `
`Was it some sort of strategy? `
`A conspiracy? Embezzlement? `
`Top-secret transportation of wealth? `
`This incomprehensible amount of gold led to all sorts of dark suspicions, but we didn't know anything about the truth. `
`All told, the gold weighed an incredible 10 tons. `
`That was the only truth we could wrap our minds around at the moment... `
`They had strongly resisted showing this to us. `
`However, the submarine could no longer make sea, and it was apparently continuing to take in water bit by bit. `
`Rokkenjima had been outfitted in an extremely slipshod way, so we had no means of repairing it. `
`Also, though we could unload the sub, there was no way we'd be able to lift it up again once it had filled with water and sunk to the bottom. `
`Now that transporting the gold away had clearly become an impossible goal, `
`...they had apparently decided on unloading it. `
`Of course, they made no effort to explain the reason behind all this gold. `
`They just asked us to help them take it out... `
`"<Why would they take so much gold out of the country...? `
`Couldn't they have changed the course of the war with this much wealth...?>" `
`"<...Weapons change the course of war, `
`but after the war, they aren't useful for anything. `
`...Money can also change the course, `
`but it remains just as valuable after the war.>" `
`There's no longer any way to change the course of this war. `
`The Axis powers will probably all surrender, leading to an Allied victory. `
`Anyone could tell that simply by looking at the American planes flying across the sky day after day. `
`However, gold does not lose its value after war. `
`Everyone stared upwards, `
`dumbfounded...`	
`...as the winch slowly lifted the dully sparkling gold... `
