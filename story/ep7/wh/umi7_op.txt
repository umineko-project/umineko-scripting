`{m:-5:—}—Witness to your final dream, `
`{e:080:{f:5:Publius Virgilia Maro}}} `
`The suspects were gathered in a room, and several Inquisitors of Heresy were reporting on the results of their investigation. `
`Their uniforms closely resembled those of Eiserne Jungfrau, but they were slightly different. `
`Also different were the badges signifying their department. `
`Then came the sound of someone clapping their hands once. `
`It was the lead female Inquisitor. `
`She was announcing that all reasoning had been completed. `
`"As has been shown, it is all quite clear. `
`Know that the preceding logic has proven the nonexistence of your alibi." `
`At the other end of her pointing finger was a quivering maid with frightened eyes. `
`Her name was... `
`...no, that's not important. `
`What matters now is that she could've entered the closed room study where the victim was found whenever she pleased, `
`and furthermore, that her claimed alibi for the time of the crime has been proven to contradict the facts. `
`Shaking, the maid tried to continue in her illogical pleading, but all of her statements had already been seen through. `
`"With this, we conclude our proof of the "who dunnit" and the "how dunnit". `
`Know that your position as the culprit is now an unshakable fact." `
`"Y-You must be joking...! `
`Wh-Wh-Why would I kill the Master I loved and respected so...?! `
`I have no motive, no reason...!" `
`"...Who did it and how. `
`Know that establishing these is more than sufficient. `
`Please, allow me to speak. `
`Know that motives are unnecessary in mysteries." `
`The Inquisitor spoke coldly. `
`After finishing her witch's prayer, {f:5:Virgilia} stepped back from the coffin, which lay on an altar bedecked with many beautiful roses. `
`In her place, Battler moved to the front of the coffin, wearing his territory lord's cape... `
`Though the cape was supposed to represent dignity and majesty, `
`it somehow made Battler look smaller. `
`Battler held a book with a majestic binding in his hand. `
`It was...a game record that had just been written. `
`Or, perhaps it was a tale. `
`A game. `
`Or else a Fragment. `
`Written in it...was the "dream" that would be more enjoyable for her than any other... `
`Battler pressed it against his forehead and contemplated for some time. `
`"............" `
`Then, he kissed it... `
`and laid it gently in the coffin. `
`It rested upon her chest. `
`She looked like a little girl clutching her favorite stuffed animal as she drifted off to sleep... `
`"...This is... `
`the sole tale I have to offer up you." `
`This tale will be shut up with you in your coffin, for all eternity. `
`So, no one will be able to read it except for you, there in your coffin. `
`"Shut away in that cat box, `
`the only `
`unchanging, `
`inviolable, `
`...eternal tale." `
`"This way, `
`...no one will be able to defile it. `
`...No one can deny it, `
`and no one can argue against it. `
`...This is just between me and her, `
`...just the two of us, `
`our one and only certain... `
`truth." `
`Those bastards... `
`A man dashed through a town wrapped in twilight. `
`The daytime hustle and bustle of this beautiful village, which combined the traditional with the orderly in the classic style of the last century, now seemed like a mere dream. `
`The orange setting sun was already hidden behind the clock tower, and the narrow alleyway was rapidly descending into darkness. `
`As the gas lights began to turn on, they only made the darkness of the twilight stand out all the more. `
`The man sprinted. `
`There was no time. `
`He had to hurry. `
`He'd had several experiments to do and things he had to check, and it had all taken longer than he'd expected. `
`"Yes, there's no mistake there. `
`The "who dunnit" and "how dunnit" are more than enough in the mystery genre." `
`In the mystery genre, the motive, or the "why dunnit", is given the lowest priority. `
`To have a murder, you need to have a culprit, and he needs to commit a crime. `
`Motive isn't required for that. `
`So, it's usually the most ignored element. `
`In fact, these days, there are even some who call it unnecessary. `
`"If you find the culprit with nothing but the "why dunnit", that's no mystery. `
`That's propaganda. `
`However..." `
`However, just because of that fact... `
`...It doesn't mean you can neglect the motive, ...the heart. `
`"...We both know how much fun she'll be having in her final sleep. `
`So, I doubt anyone could disturb it. `
`...After all, who could possibly disturb a sleeping child smiling at a happy dream?" `
`"............" `
`"Come. `
`...It is time for us to leave. `
`If we're too noisy, we'll wake her from her dream." `
`"...You're right. `
`What else should you do with a sleeping kid `
`except put a blanket on them, turn off the lights, and walk away quietly..." `
`After looking at the coffin one last time, {f:5:Virgilia} turned around quietly. `
`Battler did the same, ...but then he stopped and turned to face the rose-covered altar... `
`"............" `
`Battler offered up his final words within his heart. `
`As long as those words didn't leave his mouth, no one would be able to know what they were. `
`...However, those words of the heart caused Battler's expression to change several times. `
`At first, he frowned sadly... then, his face clouded with remorse... and then changed to a bitter, exasperated smile. `
`...It flashed through several varied expressions. `
`Then, ...the final expression that crossed his face... `
`was, surprisingly, `
`...a gentle smile. `
`"......... `
`............" `
`Something rose to Battler's lips. `
`However, he bit it back down. `
`There could certainly be no words to describe the many feelings he kept in his chest. `
`So, ...saying anything aloud would probably be crude. `
`Battler understood this...and stopped himself from speaking once more with a wry smile. `
`"............" `
`"...Thank you." `
`"Oh, I have done nothing to deserve your gratitude..." `
`"...I'll leave the rest to you." `
`After seeing {f:5:Virgilia} nod back at him, Battler turned away from the altar one more time... `
`...and left the chapel. `
`{f:5:Virgilia} also disappeared, `
`...and with that, all disturbances that might have interrupted "her" blissful sleep had vanished... `
`The Inquisitors of Heresy listened with calm...no, scornful gazes. `
`They listened to the frantic babbling of the maid accused of murdering her master. `
`However, nothing she said could bury the fault in her own alibi. `
`They were all mere emotional arguments. `
`{n}I loved and respected the Master so much. I had no motive for killing him. `
`No matter how much she spoke, `
`it only made her look more and more like the floundering true culprit struggling pathetically. `
`The requirements for the "who dunnit" and "how dunnit" had been satisfied. `
`{n}As for the "why dunnit", the motive, the heart... `
`...No matter how much she spoke of gratitude for her master, who had graciously given her a job when she'd been left by the wayside after various misfortunes, `
`it didn't help her case in the slightest in the mystery genre. `
`Therefore, her motive didn't matter. `
`{n}All of that could just be {i:squeezed out} of the culprit afterwards. `
`An Inquisitor of Heresy took out a roll of parchment and held it forth, cutting off the maid's sobs and protests. `
`"This is how you committed the crime. `
`Know that this indictment has been received by the Great Court and that your arrest has been approved. `
`Here is the warrant for your arrest. `
`Motive is unnecessary. `
`Know that such a thing is completely extraneous to the matter of pinpointing the culprit. `
`Please, allow me to speak. `
`Know that we of the SSVD possess methods of forcing unrepentant criminals to reveal the truth." `
`"With these interrogation tools blessed by the powers of justice, we Inquisitors of Heresy will strap up your limbs, burn you, crush you, stretch you and hang you, `
`and in so doing wring the red truth out of you. `
`...It isn't even necessary for you to confess! `
`Aides, arrest that maid!" `
`"It wasn't me! I didn't kill the master...!! `
`N-No, noooooooooo!!" `
`"Hold it right there. `
`You've got the wrong culprit." `
`A man kicked the door open, and the Inquisitors were all shocked at the sight of him. `
`"...Wh-Why are you here? `
`Know that this case is no longer your responsibility...!" `
`"Quiet. `
`You find one person without an alibi and just assume that she's the culprit? `
`Do you really think there's no need for a motive, for a heart, in crime? `
`Crimes are committed by people. `
`There are no crimes without a heart. `
`I'll never accept a theory that neglects the heart." `
`"Kn-Know that your obsession over the "why dunnit" is simply embarrassing...! `
`The "why dunnit" is unnecessary! `
`Such a thing can be extracted easily through interrogation! `
`Even the Great Court has already acknowledged that this woman is the culprit...!!" `
`"True, the Great Court does assume that everyone besides the maid has an alibi. `
`But that's just because they heard you say so, and they've mistaken your overconfidence and conceit for wisdom. `
`If any one of the other suspects loses their alibi, your evidence so far proves nothing. `
`...Just look at how pathetic some of these other alibis are. `
`Did the clock in the reception hall chime midnight at exactly the right time? `
`Did the dog by the back door bark at everyone?" `
`"So, you managed to prove the maid's alibi false. `
`Congratulations. `
`But does it end there? `
`It may have been possible for her to do it, but does she have any motive at all? `
`Are the alibis for the others absolutely perfect? `
`This maid wasn't the only one with a false alibi. `
`You have to keep on searching if you want to find the others. `
`Was there some sort of grudge against the victim? Or some money-related problem? `
`Don't abandon motive, don't abandon the heart. `
`Dry mysteries where the motive can just be figured out later aren't worth anyone's time." `
`"I-If the maid isn't the culprit, then why did she fake an alibi?! `
`Even asking such a question is a waste of time! `
`Know that we just have to interrogate her, wring out the red truth, and have her sign in red blood to everything that happened at the time of the crime!" `
`"Yeah, you probably can do that. `
`You can just use that torture of yours to squeeze out everything frankly and objectively, as seen from the eyes of God. `
`But you know what? `
`...I'll never accept mysteries and theories that lack heart." `
`"I-I have already taken over responsibility for this case!! `
`I even have a decree right here! `
`Come now, Aides, know that there is no reason to hesitate! `
`I order you to arrest this maid!!" `
`When she gave this order, her subordinates hesitated, looking back and forth between their superior and that man... `
`"I won't let you. `
`The real culprit's a different person. `
`It's possible to use motive to find them, `
`and their alibi trick is an old one. `
`You can't neglect the heart." `
`"Th-There's no need for that...!! `
`We just have to find the suspicious ones who could have committed the crime, interrogate them, and squeeze out the red truth!! `
`On the off-chance that they aren't the culprit, `
`then we just have to interrogate the next suspect...!!" `
`"You call that reasoning?" `
`"Stand back!! `
`We will arrest that woman!! `
`Know that this maid is the culprit!!" `
`"{p:1:It is forbidden for a servant to be the culprit}!!" `
`"Wh- `
`What... `
`...did you say...?!?!" `
`The words of power blasted away the Aides trying to arrest the maid. `
`"{p:1:......Van Dine's Twenty Rules, Rule #11}. `
`...If you want to torture this maid, make sure you double check the alibis for the second wife and her lover first." `
`"Th-Those two already have a clear alibi for the time of the crime...!!" `
`"That, an alibi? `
`Dammit, a fool like you couldn't understand no matter how easy I make it for you. `
`If you want to call yourself the Head Inquisitor, try and figure out at least that much for yourself. `
`Until then, I'll be taking that maid's arrest warrant." `
`"Th-Then what about you?! `
`Can you prove that this maid didn't commit the crime?! `
`Know that she was clearly away from the kitchen at the time of the crime! `
`What was she doing then, and where?! `
`She can't prove it, I can't prove it, and you can't prove it! No one can! `
`That's why we have no choice but to use these torture devices to interrogate her until the red truth is squeezed out!!" `
`"You can squeeze as much blood and truth from the true culprit as you damn well please. `
`However, `
`I won't let you interrogate or torture anyone who isn't that culprit." `
`"Th-This is why everyone says you're too soft...! `
`All the suspicious must be interrogated! `
`That is how we Inquisitors of Heresy conduct our witch trials!!" `
`"That's right, we are Inquisitors of Heresy. `
`Felling evil witches is our job. `
`However, we mustn't risk hurting the innocent. `
`We mustn't put them under suspicion...! `
`All humans have their own personal truths. `
`Those should only be exposed when they commit crimes. `
`We've been given the right to expose them. `
`But there's one thing we can't do." `
`"...Wh-What...?!" `
`"No one, not even God, has the right to expose the innocent truths of those who have not sinned!!" `
`The maid finally realized that he was trying to protect her. `
`"...I-I don't know who you are, but... `
`Th... `
`...Thank you... `
`...very much...! `
`I'm...really not...the culprit!" `
`"Yeah, I know. `
`...Your boyfriend said he'd be willing to give up everything to prove your alibi. `
`You should thank him. `
`That kid said that honor and reputation are worth nothing compared to you." `
`"...B-But, if he does that, he'll..." `
`"It won't come to that. `
`Exposing the secrets between lovers is a job for third-rate magazines. `
`That's not mystery. `
`...I'll never allow for heartless reasoning." `
`Then, for the first time, the man's sullen expression relaxed, and he patted the maid's head roughly. `
`"...I'm sure you two will be happy together. `
`Still, meeting together in secret while on the job is hardly praiseworthy. `
`Try to keep that to a minimum." `
`"...Th-Thank you so much... `
`Thank you so much..." `
`These words were heard only by the two of them. `
`The man had learned of her innocence, which could only be proven by exposing the secrets of a pair of young lovers, and he had rushed about in search of a solution, resentful of the arrogance of those trying to expose this by forcible means. `
`"The point of theory-making is not to create a culprit `
`or to trample the truths that lie in the hearts of those who have not sinned. `
`...If you want to play the detective, don't neglect the heart. `
`Otherwise, we're just intellectual rapists. `
`Don't forget it!!" `
`"Uu...ggh...ggggghhhhh...!!" `
`When the man spoke, the Inquisitors no longer had any way to argue back. `
`This man's name is Will. `
`And yet, that's not what everyone used to call him. `
`Head Inquisitor of Heresy of the SSVD, the 8th District Repentance Enforcement Agency of the Great Court of Heaven. `
`Wizard-hunting Wright. `
`"This is the last thing I have to pass on to you guys. `
`If you want to be the next "Wizard-hunting Wright", remember it. `
`No matter what!!" `
