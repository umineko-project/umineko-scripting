`"Lieutenant Yamamoto, `
`the Italians don't want us to tell the mainland about this gold." `
`"...Heheh. `
`So, they don't want our country to snatch it away from them." `
`"<What did he say?>" `
`"<He's saying your group probably doesn't want it reported...because you fear that Japan will steal it away from you.>" `
`"<Lieutenant Angelo is actually more afraid of Italy itself finding out. `
`To us, our homeland's current government is a mere puppet set up by the Allied Forces. `
`If they find out, the gold will be returned to them. `
`However, that would be the same as handing the gold over to our enemies.>" `
`They'd come all this way to make sure that the gold didn't fall into enemy hands. `
`They needed to hide it from that puppet government... `
`...until their homeland could be truly restored... `
`"Ushiromiya, `
`make a proposal to the Italians. `
`Tell them that we wish to offer our assistance." `
`"What sort of assistance...?" `
`"Let's see if I've got this straight. `
`They want that gold kept secret, so their homeland doesn't find out about it. `
`But they'll need to find at least a transport ship if they plan to carry it off this island. `
`If they try that though, the mainland will hear about it, which means the Italian government will too." `
`"That's right. `
`...In other words, there's no longer any way to take that gold off Rokkenjima." `
`Their mission must have been to hide the gold in absolute secrecy until the day of their homeland's restoration. `
`Later on, several plausible rumors would circulate... `
`...about how Nazi Germany also moved much of its secret wealth to certain hidden areas in South America just prior to its collapse. `
`It was a very natural conclusion to reach. `
`That submarine was their only method of transporting the gold in secrecy, and it's become completely useless. `
`They can't fully stop the water from seeping in, and it'll probably sink completely before much longer. `
`There's no longer any way for them to transport the gold in secrecy. `
`In other words, their mission has ended in failure here in the Far East. `
`So, just how is Lieutenant Yamamoto proposing that we assist them...? `
`"The Rokkenjima base is top-secret, and no one knows about it. `
`The islanders in the surrounding area think this island's ill-omened and deserted, so they never come near it. `
`...Catch my drift, Ushiromiya?" `
`"<What did he say?>" `
`"<As we told you earlier, no one knows about this base. `
`And, as you can see, it's of no use strategically, so the higher-ups have already forgotten about it. `
`...It sounds like Lieutenant Yamamoto's suggesting that you hide the gold on this island.>" `
`Beatrice quickly translated this and told Lieutenant Angelo. `
`He began discussing something rapidly with his subordinates. `
`They didn't look happy. `
`Japan may have been their ally, but they probably didn't want to leave the gold for reconstructing their motherland in Asian hands. `
`Still, it was hard to imagine any other option for them. `
`"<...It's a fierce debate. `
`Some say that there's no other option, while others think we should remain loyal to our homeland no matter the cost. `
`...Lieutenant Angelo is stuck between a rock and a hard place.>" `
`The final order given to them by their fallen homeland was to hide the gold. `
`However, by now, there was no way for that order to be carried out successfully. `
`If the mainland or their own homeland found out, the gold would probably be confiscated by the wrong people, from their point of view. `
`If they really wanted to carry out their homeland's orders faithfully, `
`...Lieutenant Yamamoto's proposal was extremely reasonable... `
`Though he couldn't understand their words, he seemed to realize how divided they were. `
`"Heheheh, if we help out, we'll be able to hide the gold in total secrecy. `
`Fortunately, there's an abandoned tunnel that stretches all the way across this island." `
`"<...He's saying that, if you hide the gold underground and bury it on this island, no one will be able to find it.>" `
`"<Our side is saying that it sounds like a realistic proposal. `
`...However, there seems to be some resistance to accepting Japanese help.>" `
`"...It seems they're having difficulty coming to a decision." `
`"Heheh. `
`Do you really have a choice, Italians? `
`You don't think you can hide that gold without our help, do you? `
`And I doubt you want to leave it lying around on the beach for much longer." `
`"<Lieutenant Angelo wants to minimize the number of people who know about the gold. `
`...He doesn't trust the Japanese, but it looks like he's decided that Lieutenant Yamamoto's plan is the best possible option. `
`But...he seems suspicious.>" `
`"<About what?>" `
`"<He's wondering whether they really intend to move a full 10 tons of gold and swear themselves to secrecy... without any sort of compensation...>" `
`"50%." `
`"...Sir, you can't be-" `
`"Hand over half of the gold to us. `
`With that as our work wages, we'll hide the other half nice and safe for them." `
`"<...H-He's telling you to give us half of it.>" `
`The instant Beatrice translated that sentence, Lieutenant Angelo slammed his hands on the desk and stood up. `
`Instead of flinching, Lieutenant Yamamoto, true to his boasts of once being a thug who everyone feared, `
`actually looked even more relaxed and confident than he had previously. `
`"After all, they really don't have the option of refusing. `
`We could demand 80% if we wanted. `
`I've lowered that to 50% as a sign of good faith. `
`...Of course, we aren't the only ones with leverage here. `
`If the Italians decide to leak this to the outside, all of the gold will probably be taken by Japan or Italy. `
`We won't get even a single yen out of it. `
`This can only work if we're both partners in crime here." `
`"<He's saying we should all be partners in the crime of embezzlement. `
`...By now, he's already moved on to speaking as an individual, not as a soldier...>" `
`"<I don't believe it... `
`So, the gold has blinded him...>" `
`Lieutenant Yamamoto was grinning. `
`It really did look as though he had been blinded by greed, just as Beatrice said... `
`"If they leave it just piled up where it is, you can be sure that it'll be noticed when the boat comes for them from the mainland. `
`If that happens, none of us will profit. `
`They ought to accept our proposal and hide the gold as soon as possible." `
`"<...It sounds like Lieutenant Angelo is dead set on the Japanese and Italian governments not finding out about this. `
`He wants to carry out his duty until the end.>" `
`"<So, what exactly does that mean?>" `
`"<He wants the gold buried deep within the island, even if he has to pay some percentage to buy your silence. `
`...Of course, some of his subordinates object strongly. `
`They're saying that 50% is out of the question.>" `
`"Ushiromiya, `
`how are they doing?" `
`"......They also don't want any more people laying eyes on the gold. `
`...However, they seem to object to the portions." `
`"<Lieutenant Angelo says they'll consider 10%. `
`...Though he's also saying that he's fairly sure Lieutenant Yamamoto won't accept that.>" `
`"Ushiromiya, `
`what's the Italians' answer?" `
`"...They say they'll consider 10%." `
`This time, it was Lieutenant Yamamoto who slammed down on the desk. `
`But the Italians didn't flinch either. `
`...An incredible tension filled the small room... `
`However, despite his violent outburst a second ago, Lieutenant Yamamoto's expression still looked smug and in control. `
`He was probably confident that he now had the initiative. `
`"10%! `
`Now there's a modest proposal. `
`...Okay, sure, I'll give up 10%. `
`We'll split it 40/60. `
`Tell them I won't go any lower than that!" `
`40% for the Japanese. `
`60% for the Italians. `
`The lieutenant was talking tough, but in truth, these negotiations weren't being made on an equal footing. `
`If the Italians had just wanted the gold for themselves, there wouldn't have been much of a problem. `
`But what if... `
`What if they were true patriots... `
`and decided to return the gold for the purpose of reconstruction, even to the defeated puppet government of their homeland? `
`If so, they would probably report the existence of the gold to the Italian embassy. `
`Eventually, the Italian government would petition the Allied nations for the retrieval of their gold. `
`...It probably wouldn't all make it back to Italy, but it might be used effectively to repair and rebuild their battered towns. `
`If that happened, Lieutenant Yamamoto and his friends would only be able to sneak out a few ingots at most. `
`He was greedily planning to make this his own treasure island, so that he and his subordinates could have an enormous fortune all to themselves. `
`...If he wanted to succeed, the Italians would have to keep the presence of the gold quiet. `
`"<But there's one thing I don't get. `
`...If Lieutenant Angelo doesn't want to let anyone have the gold, he could've just let the submarine sink. `
`Why did he have it unloaded?>" `
`"<...I'd rather not think about it, `
`...but Lieutenant Angelo might have started planning to embezzle the gold as soon as he realized that their mission would be impossible to complete. `
`Right now, he's asking his subordinates for their opinions `
`both as soldiers and as individuals with families waiting for them back home. `
`...The more straight-laced soldiers are furious.>" `
`The discussion between the Italians was becoming fierce and emotional. `
`Though their homeland had fallen, they had come all this way in accordance with its orders. `
`They had probably been given this mission because they were particularly faithful and duty-minded troops. `
`It seemed they couldn't just agree to a foreigner's proposal to embezzle and split up the gold... `
`Lieutenant Angelo looked like he was doing all he could to calm the unexpectedly fervent rage of his subordinates. `
`...Looks like the gold is blinding them too. `
`Everyone's mixing up their true feelings with how they want to be seen, and they can't make up their minds... `
`"How's their answer coming?! `
`Ushiromiya!!" `
`"<...Bice, `
`Lieutenant Yamamoto's asking for an answer.>" `
`"<...They're saying they want some time to think. `
`I had you to talk to, so I was able to distract myself from our current situation, but that wasn't true for the rest of them. `
`...They lost a lot of comrades at the end of a very long journey, and now they're here, and in a tight spot. `
`They've even lost their mission, the one thing they could depend on to guide them. `
`They don't know what to do...>" `
`"Sir, `
`...they say they'd like some time." `
`"Heheh, sure, let 'em talk it over all they want. `
`But they'd better not take too long. `
`If we're gonna hide the gold, that'll take time and effort. `
`...Make your decision before noon tomorrow. `
`That's all, Italians!" `
`"<...He's giving you until noon tomorrow. `
`...That bastard, he's practically threatening you.>" `
`"<Lieutenant Angelo says he'll ask for everyone's thoughts on the matter...>" `
`"<Which way do you think they'll go?>" `
`"<It'll probably be tough going. `
`...It seems Lieutenant Angelo is willing to consider splitting it, `
`but his subordinates and the others will probably oppose that. `
`...All of them have lost close friends on their voyage to the Far East. `
`They're firm in their desire to do their duty for our homeland.>" `
`"<...Will they refuse Lieutenant Yamamoto's proposal?>" `
`"<Even if they do, the gold will just fall into someone else's hands. `
`...If nothing is going to be left anyway, Lieutenant Angelo suggests that they each sneak at least one ingot back with them, and some of the others seem to agree, but... `
`Men always get carried away at times like this. `
`Even I can't guess what they'll do...>" `
`"...I imagine the Italians had some complicated feelings about all this." `
`"In their eyes, the Italy that surrendered was probably little better than an enemy country. `
`Letting the gold go back there would make their entire voyage meaningless." `
`"However, `
`embezzling and divvying up the gold would also make their whole voyage meaningless..." `
`"The country they felt obligated to serve had already fallen. `
`That alone destroyed the significance of their journey. `
`Not a happy story for them." `
`"...If it's bound to be meaningless anyway, `
`wouldn't keeping hold of even just a few ingots be better than nothing?" `
`"Sure, if you want to calculate straight-up profit and loss. `
`......But men aren't like that." `
`The Italians were gathered in a cramped room, arguing fiercely. `
`"I don't like it! `
`We must remain true to our soldier spirit until the end, for the sake of our fallen comrades!' `
`"And how do you define "remaining true"? `
`By hiding the gold on this island? `
`By accepting the proposal of those Asians?!' `
`"We can't trust them! `
`Especially that Yamamoto person! `
`We mustn't let our guards down!' `
`"Unloading the gold and letting the Japanese see it was a huge mistake! `
`We should've let it sink with the sub!' `
`"Oh, wonderful idea, let's just sink it right inside a Japanese base! `
`It would've been pulled up eventually. `
`That wouldn't hide anything!' `
`"It doesn't matter. There's no way to get the gold off this island without anyone knowing.' `
`"If we had just taken the honorable path and scuttled the sub, none of this would've happened...!!' `
`"If we had known then that the sub would be broken beyond repair...' `
`"Why did the lieutenant commander contact the Japanese military and ask for help? `
`How was he planning to carry out our mission if they found out about the gold?' `
`"Our mission was a failure from the moment he asked them for help!' `
`"All of us have families waiting for us back home. `
`And we've more than done our part, I'd say, voyaging all the way to this island country in the Far East. `
`You might call this fair and just payment for our services.' `
`"*chatter*chatter*! `
`*chatter*chatter*chatter*!!' `
`"Lieutenant Angelo, `
`...if the Japanese prove to be less than amicable, we need to be prepared to take extreme measures.' `
`"...And what do you mean by extreme measures, Corporal?' `
`Someone gulped. `
`A stiff tension hung over the room... `
`"The Japanese here are pushovers. `
`They're all cowards with no battle experience.' `
`"And we're the elite. `
`We know the layout of almost the entire base, along with the number of Japanese troops and how they're arranged. `
`If Lieutenant Angelo gives the order, we should be able to subdue them quickly.' `
`"Only a few of them, Yamamoto included, look like fighters. `
`The rest are just laborers attached to the military. `
`It may look like they have the advantage of numbers, but we have the greater military force.' `
`"If we kill the Japanese, what exactly are we gonna say when the boat comes to pick us up? `
`You really think that'll work?!' `
`"There should be plenty of ways to work it, as long as the corpses aren't found.' `
`"Lieutenant Angelo, `
`...it'll be easy to subdue this base. `
`If we kill Yamamoto and the few strong fighters, the laborers will probably surrender easily.' `
`"Let's have them carry the gold and bury it. `
`...Of course, we'll have to silence them afterwards.' `
`"Are you suggesting we massacre all of them...?' `
`"Let's do it. `
`If we kill them all, no one will know about the gold.' `
`At that moment, the supposedly locked door opened slightly, and a metal object was thrown in. `
`{a:c:`
`"{ruby:Grenade:Granata}!!!" `
`As the yell rang out, the table was kicked over to be used as a shield, and they all dropped to the floor. `
`However, in this cramped room, it probably wouldn't do them any good. `
`The Italians were all prepared for death. `
`"......?' `
`"A dud! It's a dud!!' `
`Fortunately, the shoddy grenade was a dud. `
`The door was slammed open, and three Japanese soldiers wielding pistols jumped in. `
`"Dammit, it's a dud!! `
`Kill the Italians, kill the Italians!!" `
`"Return fire!! Fire at will!!' `
`In this small room, no matter who shot where, it was bound to hit someone. `
`The exchange of bullets instantly caused a rain of blood, with casualties on both sides. `
`The three who had jumped in were covered with bullet holes and fell over, moaning and thrashing... `
`"Gggghgggghghgh... `
`gghh... `
`.........! `
`*cough*... `
`*cough*...' `
`"Gino!! Gino!! `
`Damn, they got his lung, we can't save him!!' `
`"We should consider ourselves lucky! `
`If that grenade had gone off, we'd all be dead!' `
`The grenade was still rolling about on the floor... `
`It had been a surprise attack. `
`...Lieutenant Yamamoto had probably judged that the negotiations wouldn't go his way and had decided to make the first move. `
`Or, maybe he'd been planning from the beginning to put them in a position `
`where they'd be gathered in one place to discuss his offer. `
`Rokkenjima was their island. `
`If they killed all the Italians, then not half, but all of the gold would go to the Japanese. `
`There was a chance the grenade might go off late. `
`The Italians rushed out into the corridor. `
`They heard gunfire from down the hallway. `
`It was coming from the direction of the submarine dock. `
`Clearly, the troops guarding the pile of gold were being attacked. `
`"Lieutenant Angelo!! What are your orders?!!' `
`"We have no choice!! `
`Kill the Japanese!!' `
`"L-Lieutenant! `
`These guys are good. `
`Those Italians aren't your ordinary sailors!" `
`"Heheh, I see. They needed men good enough to guard that gold, after all. `
`We have the numbers. `
`Keep your cool, surround them, and kill them!! Let's hunt some Italians!!" `
`As soon as I heard the sound of repeated gunfire, I knew. `
`I knew that something, which had been smoldering since the time the gold was unloaded, had finally burst. `
`The eyes of our soldiers looking at that gold hadn't been normal. `
`Yes, those eyes had been entranced by demons. `
`The Italians had been pushed to the limits by the heavy burden they bore. `
`Who wouldn't have snapped after being trapped in a distant land, where you can't understand the language or the writing? `
`Thinking I had to do something, I ran towards the sound of gunfire. `
`...Looking back on it, that was an extremely stupid thing to do. `
`That sound meant that there were people shooting at each other. `
`People killing each other. `
`And yet, unarmed as I was, I dashed towards the sound, as though I was trying to mediate some schoolyard fight. `
`...It didn't take long before I learned how foolish and naive that was in the heat of battle. `
`"...H-Hiraoka?!" `
`Warrant Officer Hiraoka was lying face down, his entire body drenched in blood. `
`Judging by the trail of blood behind him, it was clear that he had somehow managed to crawl here from a different room before dying. `
`No, he was still twitching. `
`He might not be dead yet. `
`...But, on this island without a doctor... `
`...no, even if we had a doctor, `
`who could possibly... `
`save a man who had been shot this many times in the chest... `
`When I looked into the room he must have crawled out of, `
`I saw two more bloodstained Japanese corpses. `
`"A-Aaah...aaaah... `
`Th...They're d..." `
`I fell backwards pathetically on my butt, my mouth hanging open in shock... `
`...Come to think of it, that was the first time I had ever faced death in my life. `
`The entire world was at war. `
`Even though millions were dying both East and West, `
`...this was the first time I'd met with a person's death directly. `
`Ridiculous. `
`...Didn't I join the army hoping to die? `
`Didn't I whine about not being sent to the front lines? `
`Yeah, so rejoice, Kinzo. `
`Isn't this the death you were looking for...?! `
`Why not spread your hands and yell out loud? `
`"Come for me, magnificent death!!" `
`Someone came running towards me. `
`It was a colleague of mine, a Japanese man. Tajima-kun. `
`"R-R-R-R-Ru...!!" `
`He dashed towards me, pale-faced and out of breath. `
`His face seemed horribly contorted with terror. `
`Mine probably looked the same. `
`"Tajima-kun, ...wh-what happened...?" `
`"R-Run away... `
`W-We'll...we'll all be killed!!" `
`Someone yelled in Italian, and at the same time, Tajima-kun let out a scream... `
`Then, he grabbed onto me as he fell to the floor. `
`A red stain was spreading across his back before my eyes... `
`"Tajima...kun..." `
`"...R- `
`Run... `
`... `
`*cough* `
`..." `
`As he spat bubbles of blood, he said that one word...and died. `
`But the shock of seeing someone die right in front of me did not freeze my heart. `
`...At a fundamental level, all living things are unconcerned with the deaths of others. `
`The one thing that matters is whether they themselves die or not. `
`It was the barrel of the gun the Italian soldier was pointing that froze my heart... `
`Tajima-kun's back burst once more as he leaned against me. `
`Flesh tore, blood splattered. `
`The warm splash of it covered my face. `
`Was the Italian still trying to finish him off, even though he had stopped moving for good? `
`How foolish I've been... `
`Can I still not understand the scene in front of me?! `
`Rejoice, Kinzo!! `
`Now you'll finally get what you've wanted all this time...!! `
`The Italian hadn't fired to finish off Tajima-kun. `
`He had been aiming at the man Tajima-kun had fallen on, ...me, Ushiromiya Kinzo. `
`"Uu...uuu...uwaah...!!!" `
`I pushed his corpse aside, scrabbled against the floor, and dashed away, tumbling over myself. `
`My hands had pushed off against the floor hard enough to tear off the ring finger fingernail on my left hand. `
`When faced with death, humans truly can resist with all they've got. `
`I tumbled over and over as I ran, scraping up parts of my body. `
`It was painful, hot. `
`But that didn't matter at all! `
`I heard the yelling in Italian come from behind me over and over again. `
`It felt like they were running, chasing after me. `
`I didn't want to look back. `
`So I kept on running and running, as though the Italians were right behind me. `
`This is...death...!! `
`Didn't you want to die? `
`No, I don't want to die!! `
`Why? `
`Didn't I want to die so badly? `
`But now, I know. `
`I know how wonderful it is to be alive. `
`She taught me. `
`Bice did. `
`I can only be free when I talk with her. `
`No! `
`By talking with her, I finally came alive for the first time. `
`I was born!! `
`I want to live. `
`I want to live, I want to live, I want to live!! `
`I don't want to die! `
`I want to live and see her, right now!! `
`If I don't see her, I'll die! I'll be killed!! `
`...Stay cool, Kinzo. `
`...She might be killed too...! `
`If you live and she dies, you might as well be dead...!! `
`Before I knew it, my face was covered in tears, snot, and saliva. `
`When I stumbled into something and fell, I was finally able to come to my senses a little. `
`"......Haah...haah... `
`......" `
`I could still hear intermittent gunfire. `
`The gunfight was still going on. `
`And, it had spread throughout the entire base. `
`...Bice. `
`...Are you...okay...? `
`I'll find her and take her to a safe place. `
`...The lieutenant will probably kill all the Italians to steal the gold. `
`Bice probably won't be an exception. `
`"Bice... `
`...Bice...!" `
`I lived for the first time after meeting you. `
`I was born. `
`So if you die, I'll die again. `
`I could feel every cell in my body being reborn, not as Ushiromiya Kinzo, ...but as a completely different Kinzo. `
`...Of course, I was terrified that I might really be shot if I went back. `
`But I didn't want to die anymore. `
`To truly die. `
`So, I was able to overcome my fear. `
`"...Biiiiceeeeeeee!!" `
`"Rubens! `
`What on earth is going on?! `
`What is all this?!' `
`"There's no need for you to know. `
`Just stay hidden there. `
`Don't come out until one of your fellow countrymen calls for you!' `
`"I heard an Italian voice!! `
`He's over there!!" `
`"Damn yellow monkeys!!' `
`Rubens stood with Beatrice behind his back and neatly shot the two men rushing at him with two 9mm bullets from his Beretta M1934. `
`However, one of the 8mm bullets from their Type 94 semi-auto pistols went straight into Rubens' chest. `
`All three of the shooters were struck in the chest and fell down in a heap. `
`"N-No!! `
`Rubens!!' `
`"...Go up to the surface... `
`You have to hide in the forest...... `
`*cough*cough*!! `
`Ggh...' `
`"Rubens!!!' `
`"...Heheheh. My, my. `
`Aren't we chatty?" `
`The next person to appear...was the commanding officer of the Japanese soldiers, Yamamoto. `
`The blast of three guns had just sounded. `
`Adding on Beatrice's screams, it was hardly surprising that he had noticed the encounter. `
`"If it had to come to this anyway, we should've taken this woman as a hostage in the first place. `
`Damn annoying, that's what they are!" `
`Yamamoto spat. `
`Beatrice used that moment to snatch up Rubens' gun. `
`"Kyaa...!!!' `
`"Well look at you, reaching to pick up a gun without missing a beat! `
`Italian women sure are scary! `
`Dammit, both of you screwed up...!!" `
`He spat this last part at the two dying men who lay moaning at his feet. `
`However, what had happened to them wasn't particularly surprising. `
`It wasn't the first time it had happened either. `
`In this tiny, cramped tunnel, nearly everyone had met head on. `
`When both sides shot recklessly in such a situation, the result was two corpses. `
`So, whoever sensed another person and pulled the trigger quickest "won". `
`That was the only way to survive this battle without a bullet in your chest. `
`Because of this, both Japanese and Italians had killed each other without hesitation, and they sometimes even pulled the trigger on oncoming allies. `
`In the midst of all this were several Japanese men who had stumbled into the fight, wondering what was going on. `
`It didn't matter whether the other person was holding a gun or not. `
`Everyone had reflexively pulled the trigger at the sight of anyone other than themselves, trying to stay alive. `
`The entire base had been wrapped up in this slaughter... `
`There was a fierce gun battle taking place on the submarine dock. `
`And a massacre resembling a hunt was taking place inside the base. `
`Most of the non-combatants assigned to this base were killed before they knew what was going on. `
`The Italians were indeed quite seasoned troops, but their numbers began to drop bit by bit. `
`Bloodstained corpses were scattered everywhere... `
`At first, it had probably been a proper gunfight. `
`However, as their minds began to grow weary and numb, `
`it devolved into that most basic cause of wars throughout humanity, the desire to kill all foreigners you don't understand... `
`Whenever they heard words they didn't understand, they pulled the trigger. `
`By that point, the screams of foreigners sounded no different from those of man-shaped beasts. `
`After all, they couldn't understand pleading in another language. `
`So, it had long ago turned into a mere massacre... `
`As the number of dead surpassed the number of living, ...silence began to return to the base. `
`Just when it felt as though everyone had died, and you could hear the desolate sound of the wind blowing through the caves, `
`there would be a sudden scream, the crisp sound of a gun, and you'd remember that the massacre wasn't yet over. `
`This happened...over and over again, `
`...and eventually, true silence fell. `
`...It marked the pitiful end for those led astray by gold. `
`The leader of the Italian soldiers, Angelo, had managed to survive somehow. `
`He encountered...nothing but the corpses of friend and foe. `
`All was quiet once more in the base. `
`If he was careless enough to call out, he might be shot from the shadows somewhere. `
`...So, he snuck about like a panther, breathing quietly and searching for remaining enemies... `
`There was no sign or trace of any living person. `
`...Maybe all of the people in this base had died. `
`"...Damn Japanese...' `
`The Japanese struck first, but at that time, we were also talking about killing them. `
`They simply made the first move as military men. `
`So, perhaps we should be grateful for this day. `
`Even if the boat had come to pick us up, there would've been no honor left for us. `
`We would've been mere failures in our mission, unfit to face our dead comrades. `
`Perhaps dying here in the Far East alongside my gun...is a more fitting end for a soldier. `
`I noticed the sound of shuffling feet coming from around the corner and strained to hear. `
`...Is someone seriously wounded and dragging their feet? `
`Noticing them before they notice me greatly helps my chances. `
`At this stage, there's no point in taking prisoners. `
`We must dispose of all the Japanese. `
`I'll dash around the corner, quickly check to see who they are, ...and shoot if it's a Japanese person. `
`Nothing more. `
`I've been hiding my footsteps the whole time. `
`They probably don't know I'm here. `
`Once the shuffling footsteps had come close enough, Angelo leaned around the corner and raised his gun. `
`The voice that reached him...spoke Italian. `
`"R-Run...' `
`"...?! `
`Y-You...!!' `
`"Heheheh, I've been looking for you, Lieutenant Angelo... `
`That makes all of you. `
`I've been counting Italian corpses, you see...!!" `
`"L-Lieutenant Angelo!! `
`Are you okay?!' `
`Blood poured from Angelo's chest, `
`...his gun fell to the floor, `
`then his knees, `
`and then the rest of his body crumpled... `
`and stopped moving. `
`Yamamoto's accuracy with a gun wasn't particularly stellar. `
`However, Angelo had waited until they were fairly close before jumping out, so Yamamoto had made the shot. `
`He had managed to hit, even with a short-barreled handgun in one hand...and a woman as a hostage in the other. `
`"Really, though, our Rokkenjima garrison was pathetic! `
`Am I the only one who's not dead?! `
`Trash, all of them!" `
`"Can't you fight without using a woman as a shield, you brute?!! `
`Let go!' `
`"Quiet! `
`Noisy, these Italian girls. `
`If you'd just be cooperative, I'd at least spare your life. Heheheh!" `
`It was such an obvious lie that even he wore a bitter smile. `
`The Italians were spies working for the enemy, and they all died along with the garrison in a gunfight. `
`Since this was the story Yamamoto wanted to tell, he couldn't afford to have any Italian survivors. `
`By this point, he wouldn't be able to keep the entire pile of gold, `
`but he should be able to grab as many as he could carry. `
`Even that would be worth a huge amount of money. `
`Beatrice suddenly swung her head, `
`smashing Yamamoto's nose hard. `
`"Someone, help! Someoooooone!!! `
`...Kya!!' `
`"...Y-You...bitch... `
`Ngaaah..." `
`She almost managed to escape. `
`However, Yamamoto quickly grabbed her leg and tripped her. `
`She fell onto her back, and Yamamoto mercilessly stomped his foot down on her stomach and pointed his gun at her. `
`"Heheheh, I don't make a hobby of taming tomboys...! `
`Die!!" `
`"Lieutenant Yamamoto, she had nothing to do with this! `
`Let go of her!" `
`Kinzo had jumped out from the shadows. `
`He was holding a gun he had stolen from one of the corpses. `
`"Hmmm? Ushiromiya? `
`Ah, so you're alive!" `
`"Let go! You're hurting her...!!" `
`"...It was you, wasn't it? `
`You tipped the Italians off." `
`"What are you talking about...?!" `
`Yamamoto didn't know that the grenade had been a dud. `
`He had been sure that the surprise attack would work, but it hadn't, `
`so he'd assumed that Kinzo must've tipped them off. `
`"It's your fault the surprise attack failed and we're stuck like this! `
`You turncoat, you traitor to your country... `
`I know you've been working with them through this woman!" `
`"Can't you see that you caused all this because you were blinded by gold?!" `
`"<Run, Kinzo! `
`This man has shot people begging for their lives! `
`He'll shoot you too!>" `
`"Don't talk, Italian! `
`If you open your mouth again, I won't hesitate to shoot." `
`"<...I-It hurts...ggaahhh...>" `
`Yamamoto ground his heel into Beatrice's gut. `
`"Stop it, stop it!! `
`She has nothing to do with this!!" `
`"Oho? `
`Are you pointing a gun at a superior officer? `
`...Stop and think a bit, fool. `
`If we agree to keep to the same story, we can have that pile of gold all to ourselves, okay? `
`...I could only grab a few on my own, but if we work together, we'll be able to sneak off with even more. `
`...I don't mean this as your superior officer. `
`Let's split it equally between us as men." `
`"The last time you offered to split the gold fifty-fifty, you tried to slit their throats!" `
`"Tch. `
`Ushiromiya, `
`looks like you prefer lead to gold!!" `
`Without any hesitation, Yamamoto raised the barrel of his gun towards Kinzo and pulled the trigger. `
`It grazed Kinzo's right ear. `
`If Yamamoto's aim had been just a bit better, the bullet would've slammed into Kinzo's face. `
`"<Kinzo?! `
`H-How could you?!!>" `
`"You...gyah?!?!" `
`Not letting Yamamoto's momentary distraction go to waste, Beatrice lashed out and planted her right foot in Yamamoto's crotch. `
`After moaning in pain, a demonic expression flashed across Yamamoto's face, and he stomped on her chest. `
`"<Bice!!>" `
`"You biiiiitch!! Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiee!!" `
`Beatrice shut her eyes tightly, hoping that she could withstand the coming pain. `
`No one wants to watch the moment they get shot... `
`"Y `
`...Y... `
`You `
`......" `
`*drip*, `
`...*drip*drip*... `
`...A blood splash poured out of Yamamoto's chest. `
`"Just as you took so many lives for your own personal reasons, `
`...I'll take your life... `
`...for mine." `
`Could Yamamoto hear Kinzo's words until the end? `
`In his last moments, he seemed to grin. `
`Then, slowly, `
`...he fell backwards with a spurt of blood. `
`"<Kinzo! `
`Are you okay?! `
`I was sure you'd been shot...! `
`Uggh...ggh...>" `
`Beatrice tried to stand up, but then doubled over and started coughing. `
`"<Bice! `
`Are you hurt...?!>" `
`"<...My ribs are hurting. `
`That brute really was stomping them hard.>" `
`"<Will you be okay...? `
`I hope they aren't broken...>" `
`"<Italian women don't break so easily. `
`...But...thanks. `
`I owe you my life. `
`If you hadn't come, it would all have ended there. `
`...Ggh...>" `
`Yamamoto had shown no mercy. `
`...Her ribs were probably cracked. `
`...We didn't have the option of waiting, possibly for several days, for the ship that was coming. `
`I made the decision to carry her away from the island. `
`The man who kept yelling about preserving the secrecy of the base is lying there dead. `
`...The next island over, Niijima, is close. `
`A small boat should be more than enough to get us there. `
`"<I need to take you to a hospital. `
`...The wound might be more serious than you realize.>" `
`"<...That's interesting. `
`I never knew there was a hospital on this island.>" `
`"<There isn't. `
`A boat should get us to the next island over. `
`...We'll get you to a hospital. `
`As for me, ...unless I cleverly cover up what happened on this island, ...I might end up getting court-martialed just for being here.>" `
`"<I have a request. `
`...Please, don't take me to a hospital.>" `
`"<Why...?>" `
`"<If we go to a hospital and the embassy is contacted, I'll eventually be sent back to Italy. `
`...If that happens, I'll be interrogated about all kinds of things. `
`I won't acknowledge the bastards who let Mama die.>" `
`"<............>" `
`"<There's no homeland for me to return to now. `
`This is the end for me. `
`So, there's nowhere I want to go anymore. `
`...Lieutenant Angelo, `
`Rubens, `
`everyone who was so kind to me... `
`...They're all dead.>" `
`"<And because of that, you want to die here too? `
`I thought you said Italian women weren't weak. `
`Live.>" `
`"<Hey, Kinzo? `
`What does it mean...to live? `
`You're the one who taught me, aren't you? `
`Living is more than just breathing. `
`...I don't want to go back to Italy.>" `
`"<...Bice.>" `
`"<You said that you were dead until you met me. `
`But it's the same for me. `
`...I died in that submarine. `
`My homeland fell, Mama died. `
`Even Papa died. `
`...I prayed that our sub would just sink to the bottom of the ocean. `
`So, when we reached this place, I was actually disappointed that we'd survived. `
`...Then, right after that, `
`Lieutenant Angelo started asking whether anyone could speak English.>" `
`When Kinzo met Beatrice, he finally forgot about dying. `
`And when Beatrice met Kinzo, ...she also forgot about dying. `
`"<Now that I've lost my homeland, my family, and my friends, `
`...my only wish... `
`is for you to kidnap me and take me away with you.>" `
`"<...Bice...>" `
`"<But...I know that's a wish that couldn't possibly come true. `
`...So, at the very least, `
`I want to be with you until the boat comes for us. `
`I don't care about the pain in my chest. `
`After all, when the boat comes and takes me away, ...I'll die.>" `
`Beatrice spoke this, smiling softly. `
`...She did her best to hide the pain in her chest. `
`"<Please, Kinzo. `
`...Just for the few days until the boat comes. `
`...Kidnap me.>" `
`"<...That's a wish... `
`...I can't grant.>" `
`Looking apologetic, Kinzo lifted Beato up and gently sat her in the boat. `
`"<...Coward. `
`...So, Japanese men are weak after all.>" `
`"<You're right. `
`...I am a coward. `
`So, I can only grant you half of your wish.>" `
`With a clunk, he placed "it", wrapped in a jacket, in the boat. `
`"<What do you mean...?>" `
`"<The part about "until the boat comes for you". `
`...That's the part I can't grant.>" `
`"<...Huh? `
`What do you mean?>" `
`"<Kidnapping you. `
`...That part, I will do.>" `
`"<...K-Kinzo...>" `
`There has to be a doctor on Niijima. `
`I'm wearing a Navy uniform. `
`I should be able to pass myself off as a survivor of a boat carrying a VIP that was sunk by enemy ships. `
`If the doctor happens to be of the greedy sort, all the better. `
`...After all, I have right here the golden magic to make people do what I say. `
`A witch...from a distant country...took my lifeless body and gave me a soul. `
`A woman came to me with the gold...and revived me with her magic. `
`"<You...are a witch. `
`...The Golden Witch.>" `
`"<*giggle* `
`Yes, the Golden Witch. `
`Even though I use the same recipe as everyone else, only my alchemy can turn pasta into a smoking black heap.>" `
`"<Haha, hahahahahahahahaha.>" `
`"<...Just like you, I'm nothing but a corpse allowed to live just as long as you're with me. `
`...If you go, I'll die straight away.>" `
`"<I won't let you die.>" `
`"<Really?>" `
`"<No matter what.>" `
`"<Take responsibility, okay? `
`...After all, you're the one kidnapping me.>" `
`"...I see. `
`So, Kinzo-san told you that much." `
`"Then, ...wait, it was you?! `
`You're the Niijima doctor who Grandfather took Beatrice to see...?" `
`"Why so shocked? `
`It should've leapt to the mind ever since the words "Niijima doctor"." `
`"All of a sudden, a soldier of the Navy appeared along with a foreign woman. `
`Of course, I was astounded. `
`...And then, he actually told me to treat her wounds confidentially, since their presence was a military secret." `
`"Was that the first time you met Grandfather...?" `
`"...Yes. `
`That was when we first met." `
`"So, you're the greedy doctor who followed orders for the sake of gold?" `
`"That's a bit harsh... `
`He suddenly brought in a foreign woman patient, explained to me that this was a military secret, `
`promised that he'd pay the medical fees later, and handed me a gold ingot as collateral. `
`I didn't want to get involved with any funny business. `
`I was reluctant to say the least." `
`"I see your point. `
`...But in the end, you did conceal Beatrice, didn't you?" `
`"I may not be as skilled as Kinzo, but I do have some familiarity with English. `
`I managed to overhear part of their conversation, and that was enough to convince me that they were not troublesome people." `
`"*cough* `
`...Of course, if I were to say that the ingot didn't tempt me, that would be a lie. `
`I was much younger then, you see." `
`"What happened to her next?" `
`"I treated her for some time before a messenger from the Ushiromiya family came and said that she would be moved to Odawara. `
`They took her away." `
`"So Grandfather didn't come to get her himself?" `
`"Regardless of how Kinzo explained away the incident on Rokkenjima, `
`he probably wouldn't be able to move about freely for some time afterwards." `
`"Precisely. `
`Kinzo-san has said that deceiving the military was the greatest challenge of his life." `
`"So, Beatrice went to Odawara, and then what...?" `
`"I have heard that she hid in one of their unused villas. `
`...After all, Kinzo already had a family at that time. `
`It must have been tricky to manage." `
`"So, leading a double life was business as usual for Kinzo, even before Kuwadorian. `
`...Whoosh." `
`"What are you doing...? `
`Is your butt itching?" `
`"...Tch." `
`"And later on? `
`Beatrice and Grandfather continued their happy relationship in the villa from then on...?" `
`"I have heard that it was a modest, peaceful life. `
`...Several years later, they had a child." `
`"...So, Kuwadorian's Beatrice was born." `
`"The birth...didn't go well... `
`It was truly a sad tale." `
`"You don't mean...she died?!" `
`"Don't be surprised. `
`Kinzo believed his daughter was Beatrice reborn. `
`...You can't neglect the heart. It's possible to reason it out." `
`"...Y-You're right. `
`...My apologies." `
`"I don't know how many years Kinzo-san spent with her in Odawara. `
`......However, judging by the Kinzo-san we grew to know afterwards, `
`one can tell how deeply he loved her, even if they only had a few years together." `
`"...... `
`...I see." `
`"And then, he made Kuwadorian for his daughter..." `
`"Kinzo-san cleverly made use of the submarine's gold to build up a fortune in a flash. `
`Then, he made use of his considerable skills in English to make connections with the GHQ, becoming immensely wealthy in a short span of time. `
`There's no need to explain this part to you, Lion-san." `
`"...Yes. `
`He used that vast wealth, ...bought Rokkenjima, and built the mansion. `
`The remaining relatives in Odawara scoffed at Grandfather, thinking he was crazy to buy an entire deserted island." `
`"If you could carry 10 tons of gold around in your pocket, Kinzo probably wouldn't have bought Rokkenjima." `
`He hid the gold somewhere in Rokkenjima, `
`built up a fortune with the ingots he'd taken out of it, ...and then bought up the whole treasure island... `
`"Exactly. `
`......And that started the legend of the Ushiromiya gold." `
`"...What about the mark of the One-Winged Eagle that was supposedly pressed into the ingots?" `
`"The One-Winged Eagle... Or, more precisely, an eagle of which only one wing is visible." `
`"What do you mean?" `
`"You see it often in Europe, do you not? `
`A crest or coat of arms with an eagle spreading its wings on it. `
`...The flag of the Salo Republic also had an eagle, ...or was it a hawk? `
`...At any rate, it had some bird of that type emblazoned on it." `
`"So, the imprint was made too lightly, ...or else it was poorly done." `
`"Correct. `
`......They used a rough, wartime press. `
`It was probably supposed to look like the crest of an eagle spreading its wings. `
`It was pressed in at a slight slant, so half of it was too light to see." `
`"So half of the eagle spreading its wings disappeared, ...making it look like a One-Winged Eagle?" `
`"Kinzo thought the seal on the gold of Beatrice, the woman who had changed his fate, looked like a One-Winged Eagle. `
`That must be why he decided to make that his own crest." `
`"...If the imprint had been made correctly, it would have been the eagle of the Salo Republic's flag, `
`...or could it have been the two-headed..." `
`"...No, no, of course not. `
`Passing the night away with Kinzo-san in front of that massive pile of gold, drinking and wondering, was truly an enjoyable experience." `
`"However, Kinzo-san didn't want people using that seal to figure out where the gold had come from. `
`The gold he took outside was all re-pressed with the One-Winged Eagle design he had created." `
`"And all he did was show you the gold? `
`What a cheapskate." `
`"Of course, after he became immensely rich, Kinzo-san came to me once more, saying that he'd pay me in full for the overdue medical expenses. `
`The amount he came with was a bit much for medical fees. `
`Though I did make sure to give him his change." `
`"And you've been friends ever since...?" `
`"Yes. `
`Kinzo-san was extremely grateful to me for keeping his secret and concealing Beatrice." `
`"...Grandfather always says that the old relatives in Odawara were a bunch of greedy liars. `
`...I'm sure he appreciated your strong sense of duty, Doctor Nanjo. `
`I think I understand why a person like Grandfather came to trust you." `
`"I also had some interest in foreign countries, as well as a hobby of playing chess. `
`Kinzo-san and I have gotten along well ever since. `
`It was a friendship that built up gradually, but grew strong before we knew it. `
`Yes, we have been friends a very long time..." `
`"People who deal with large amounts of money tend to be quite mindful of small amounts as well. `
`...When you refused to accept anything more than the medical fees, that must have earned you his admiration." `
`"Ridiculous. `
`I was just frightened by the large quantity of the money. `
`I began to regret it later, ...wahahahahaha. `
`It seems I've never had real guts." `
`"No need to worry there. `
`Guts are one thing you've got no shortage of." `
`"You think so? `
`Well, I appreciate the flattery." `
`"That wasn't flattery." `
`"...?" `
`...For at least one whole year after Kinzo's death, Nanjo had taken part in hiding the secret of that death. `
`Of course, Natsuhi must have given him some hush money. `
`Still, there could be no doubt that he'd had enough guts to withstand pressure from Kinzo's children for a long time, without slipping up once... `
`"Now that's something that'd take real guts. `
`That sense of duty must be part of your personality." `
`"...Hahahah. `
`Perhaps that is my only redeeming quality..." `
`"I think Grandfather was blessed with a good friend." `
