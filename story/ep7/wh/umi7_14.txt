`"............" `
`"...This form is..." `
`"I'm lending it to you. `
`After all, I hate idiots. `
`...*giggle*giggle* `
`Call yourself Clair, as a temporary name. `
`Or would you prefer Beato?" `
`"...... `
`...You have my gratitude. `
`This way, I won't have to expose my pitiful form." `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} had given Clair a fake form. `
`It was a temporary form, for the person acting the part of {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`A fake to fool those who still hadn't discovered {f:5:Beatrice}'s true form... `
`"...Then... `
`is this a tale... `
`about me in another world?" `
`"Lion, `
`...this is indeed a tale of you in another world, and also my tale. `
`...The tale of a world where I live as a witch, not a Human..." `
`"......I am capable of imagining "what if" scenarios for my own life. `
`...However, `
`the tale you tell... `
`...is beyond `
`anything I can imagine..." `
`"Even so, `
`...it's the life that another "you" has led." `
`"But still! `
`That doesn't mean I can accept it easily." `
`Lion suddenly yelled and looked at the floor. `
`Lion already knew. `
`Because of the Fragments lent by {f:5:Bernkastel}, Lion knew. `
`There was a different world, where Lion lived as the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`And, in this world, ...eventually, `
`......on the day of the 1986 October family conference, `
`...she would be the ringleader of a terrible crime. `
`"...Even if it is a different world, `
`...you're saying that I get my entire family and all of the servants involved in a terrible crime that I'm the mastermind of! `
`How am I supposed to deal with that?!" `
`"......Be quiet, listen, and figure it out." `
`"In a different life, I end up as a servant! `
`And if that wasn't enough, I suddenly become a witch! `
`And then, I eventually carry out several terrifying murders...! `
`How am I supposed to understand that?!" `
`"............" `
`"Yeah, I see where you're coming from. `
`...I doubt anyone could understand. `
`...This person here thought that no one would ever understand. `
`That's why you're here. `
`...That's why {f:5:Bernkastel} brought you two, two people who never should have met, together like this." `
`"......It's not like I had any deep reason for it. `
`It was just a whim." `
`"This is a motive that no one else can understand, Lion, so you need to be the one to understand it. `
`I'm not the main character in this tale. `
`You are. `
`...I'm just here to help you understand." `
`"You said that you understand the culprit's motive." `
`"...Yes." `
`"Is that motive... `
`a satisfying explanation for why I'd kill my entire family...?!" `
`"Who knows. `
`That's for you to decide. `
`Even if I say it's satisfying, that doesn't mean it'll satisfy you. `
`...You have to decide that for yourself." `
`"I really don't have a clue what's going on...! `
`I've seen several crimes called game boards that {f:5:Beatrice} supposedly carried out. `
`And now, I'm hearing another me talk about a different life from mine. `
`But there's no connection between that and the crime! `
`I don't understand!!" `
`"......At this point in the tale, ...even I... `
`could not have dreamed that I would eventually carry out such terrible crimes. `
`In fact, even if I had been able to dream of it, `
`...I did not have the power to commit those crimes at that time." `
`"Probably. `
`...Your misfortune probably came... `
`when you solved the epitaph's riddle." `
`"......Huh? `
`You mean that epitaph about the hidden gold, which Grandfather supposedly wrote...?!" `
`"There exists a system for gaining different accomplices for each crime. `
`...Reasoning can lead us to the possibility that the culprit possessed a vast amount of money. `
`We can also envision another system, `
`...which involves inviting all to the Golden Land... `
`...and making all loves bear fruit." `
`"...So, it wasn't just the motive. `
`You've already seen that far as well." `
`"That's the answer to the final riddle from the 4th game. `
`...Your greatest misfortune was solving the epitaph, `
`...reviving as the Golden Witch in the truest sense, and gaining magical power." `
`"...Looking back, ...was that really misfortune after all? `
`...I do not know. `
`However, as long as the fact that Battler-san returns in 1986 remains unchanged, `
`...some sort of tragedy would certainly have occurred." `
`"That's right. `
`...If Battler had returned a year earlier or later, `
`...that incident might not have occurred." `
`No, some small incident probably would have occurred. `
`And it would surely have been a mysterious, impossible incident, which no one could have explained. `
`But even so, compared to the Rokkenjima serial murders, it would have been a tiny thing... `
`"...If Battler-kun... `
`...had returned a year earlier or later, `
`...then what?" `
`"...... `
`...Fate can be so filled with irony. `
`...It made me walk the path of a witch, ...and when I solved the epitaph, I became a true witch. `
`...Then, six years passed, and I learned of his return. `
`...If all of that was fate, `
`...then this crime must have been inevitable and inescapable for me." `
`"In 1980, `
`Battler was resentful because of the death of his mother, Asumu, and his father's remarriage that came too soon, so he left the Ushiromiya family. `
`For six whole years, he had no direct contact with them." `
`He convinced his grandparents on his mother's side to help him and went by his mother's maiden name. `
`Then, when those grandparents passed away, he finally made up with Rudolf...and returned to the Ushiromiya family again in 1986... `
`"That bad luck...gave birth to your motive for the crime." `
`"...I did wonder. `
`...Why, after six whole years, `
`...did he finally come back?" `
`"I understand. `
`In a way, ...it would have been better for you if he had never come back." `
`"Of course, my suffering would have continued. `
`...However, I may not have tainted myself with the unforgivable crime of mass murder." `
`"......How could Battler-kun leaving `
`create a motive?" `
`"You've got it backwards." `
`"...Backwards?" `
`"The crime didn't occur because Battler left. `
`...It happened because Battler came back." `
`"...... `
`...The more I think about it, `
`...Ushiromiya Battler... `
`was quite a disagreeable man. `
`More than anything else, because he never realized that the outbreak of the crime was his fault." `
`"He did remember, in the end. `
`...However, that was long after you gave up and disappeared." `
`"...If that is so, `
`...then it would give my heart some peace..." `
`"I don't have a clue what you two are talking about anymore. `
`...But I'd like to ask you bluntly. `
`I want to know. `
`...What on earth happened to you that made you decide to commit a crime?" `
`"Yes. `
`That's the most important part. `
`...It's just like how Ushiromiya Battler respected the "why dunnit" in mystery novels. `
`......That's where the answers to all the riddles are hidden, ...both in the tale of the Golden Witch and in the game." `
`"In that case, `
`......allow me to continue. `
`...1980. `
`...Six years before I resolved myself to committing the crime." `
`"...Battler-sama... `
`...has left the Ushiromiya family...?" `
`"That's what Krauss-sama and Rudolf-sama were saying! `
`What a shock!" `
`"I have no intention... `
`of criticizing your way of life or your family situation. `
`However, Father is in a towering rage. `
`Disinheriting a son is one thing, but I've never even heard of a child becoming fed up and leaving the family on his own." `
`"...That Battler can be surprisingly stubborn. `
`Sort of like someone else I know." `
`"If you are unable to understand Battler-kun's feelings, one might question your right to be a father." `
`"Enough, Natsuhi. `
`I'm sure Rudolf was just trying to show how dedicated he was to raising Kyrie-san's child, in his own way." `
`"I would have nothing to say if this were happening next year. `
`...But why this year? `
`He's still in his period of mourning. `
`...If you consider the timing of this pregnancy, one must acknowledge that Rudolf-san has acted disgracefully." `
`"...Come on, don't be so harsh. `
`...This is my way of atoning for what I've done..." `
`"Battler-kun's trying to protest against you on the behalf of his departed mother, Asumu-san. `
`...I deeply understand how he feels. `
`If he were here, I would want to hold him and cry along with him." `
`Natsuhi's words were sharp. `
`They pierced Rudolf mercilessly. `
`Rudolf had no retort. `
`His relationship with Kyrie had been adulterous, plain and simple. `
`...According to Rudolf, he had been close to Kyrie longer than Asumu. `
`And, even after his marriage to Asumu, that relationship had not disappeared... `
`What the hell does that mean?! `
`You old bastard!! `
`So, you've just been betraying Mom from the start!! `
`Sure, I know Kyrie-san. `
`You've told me that she was your business partner and a friend whose advice you could always rely on! `
`If you're trying to say after all this time that she was more than that, then why should I give a damn?!! `
`After Mom's death, you could've done whatever you wanted! `
`I'm right there with you, saying that you should live life as you please! `
`But just when did Kyrie-san get pregnant?! `
`Back when Mom was still alive, right?! `
`Yeah, now I finally see! `
`So this is why you always make me want to vomit! `
`Are you glad that Mom's finally dead now? You are, aren't you?! `
`I'm sure it would've been so hard on you, keeping your infidelity and even a kid secret while Mom was still alive!! `
`But now that Mom conveniently kicked it, you get to marry Kyrie-san, and I get a new little brother or sister?!! `
`You can bet that Mom's crying in heaven!! `
`You bastard, you're embarrassing!! `
`I'm embarrassed!! `
`So embarrassed I can't stand to have the same last name as you!! `
`The kid is completely guiltless. `
`It'd be too sad if he or she doesn't have both parents together. `
`Go ahead, build a new family and raise that kid to have a happy life!! `
`But I'll never forgive you!! `
`Mom isn't here to hate you anymore!! `
`So I'll hate you in her place!! `
`With all of my body and soul!! `
`So long, old bastard!! `
`"............" `
`"That is enough, Natsuhi. `
`...Rudolf hasn't lost the affection he feels for Battler-kun. `
`...It may take some time, but he wants to fix their relationship one day." `
`"As any father should. `
`...If it were some complete stranger, that would be one thing, but this is your own flesh and blood son. `
`It's clearly your responsibility." `
`"...Go ahead. `
`Despise me all you want. `
`I won't argue. `
`...That's the only way I can atone." `
`"At the very least, make sure you give the new child a happy life." `
`"...The kid who's going to be born...and Battler. `
`...They're both my kids." `
`"Wedding Kyrie-san after Asumu-san's death may have been painful for Battler-kun, `
`...but it was the best choice you could make for the coming child. `
`...I understand why you did it." `
`"And I understand why Battler-kun felt like telling you that you were happy Asumu-san is dead." `
`"Stop, Natsuhi. `
`...Rudolf has already been scolded enough by the person most fit to do so." `
`"...Now then, how about some black tea? `
`Could you go ask someone in the kitchen to make us some?" `
`"......Understood." `
`Natsuhi took this as a signal to leave the room and did so. `
`Once she left, Krauss relaxed slightly. `
`"......I feel bad for Asumu-san, `
`...but if we consider the timing of that soon-to-be-born child, this might have been quite the coincidence." `
`"Almost as though... `
`...Asumu knew that, and stepped down from the stage of her own choosing. `
`...Did I kill Asumu...? `
`...If so, ...how long has it been since I started killing her..." `
`"If you still treasure Asumu-san's memory, `
`...then no matter how many years it takes, you must fix your relationship with Battler-kun." `
`"...Yeah. `
`...I know." `
`"And be sure to pour just as much affection on Kyrie-san and the new child that is to be born. `
`...While also bearing Asumu-san's cross." `
`"...... `
`...If they have reserved seating in hell..." `
`"...Hmm?" `
`"If they do, `
`...I'd like to reserve myself a VIP spot..." `
`"............" `
`The news that Battler had abandoned the Ushiromiya name swept across the family. `
`"And poor Battler-san, too... `
`I do believe that he'll make up with them eventually, but..." `
`"...This is a matter for the family. `
`It is not something servants need concern themselves with. `
`Instead, we should focus on memorizing the face of the newest member of the Ushiromiya family, Kyrie-sama." `
`"Yes, that's true. `
`She will be coming to the family conference this year..." `
`If the person who just joined the Ushiromiya family would be coming to the conference... `
`...Then what about the person who just left the family...? `
`"That means Battler isn't coming, right?" `
`"That seems the most probable outcome. `
`How lonely is the loss of a single, noisy man." `
`Though most people felt a bit lonely to see Battler leave the Ushiromiya family, they didn't think any more about it than that. `
`However, ...what about Shannon? `
`Wasn't Battler supposed to come for her on a white horse...? `
`I was surprised at first. `
`I thought that, since he had left the family, he might not be coming to this island anymore. `
`...If we consider Battler-san's feelings, this is only natural, I guess. `
`I understand painfully well why he wanted to leave his family... `
`But...does that really mean he won't come to Rokkenjima anymore...? `
`What on earth is going on? `
`{n}Will he really never return? `
`Unable to ask him this directly, I was forced to live each day fretfully... `
`...Battler-san. `
`I understand how you feel... `
`But...... `
`......To say that you'll never return because you've abandoned your family... `
`...That's a lie, right...? `
`I was so confused that the world seemed to be spinning around me... `
`I had a tight feeling in my chest...and couldn't think about anything. `
`When I happened to touch my cheek, `
`...I was surprised to find it hot and wet. `
`...While wearing a truly miserable expression on my face, `
`I was... `
`crying... `
`{a:c: `
`Shannon, `
`......Shannon......} `
`From far away, ...I could hear someone calling to me. `
`{n}But it was a very strange sort of distance. `
`Though it felt very far away, ...the voice also seemed to be coming from right beside me. `
`"...Shannon, `
`I know...your heart..." `
`"It's okay. `
`...It's just a fight between a boy and his father. `
`And I'm sure the rumors blow everything out of proportion. `
`Everything's just being exaggerated." `
`"Indeed. `
`There are none who can say with certainty that Battler will not return to this island. `
`You would do well to remain strong." `
`...Where...is this place...? `
`I seem to remember it somehow. `
`I think it reminds me of the scenery from a strange dream I once had. `
`...Then...this must be another dream... `
`I was there, under an arbor surrounded by a golden rose garden, `
`and two witches in white and red dresses were showering words of encouragement upon me... `
`"You can be sure that those rumor-mongering young servants are embellishing the story however they please. `
`So, he has changed his name, they say?! `
`Surely, this can be nothing more than a family quarrel." `
`"......... `
`...Thank you. `
`...I wish I could believe that..." `
`"Of course it's true. `
`He's a boy, after all. `
`You can hardly be surprised that he's had a few arguments with his dad." `
`"Precisely, as you say. `
`Clearly, they will make it up to each other once they cool their heads." `
`"When men argue, it's always fiery at first, but they burn out quickly." `
`"In contrast, an argument between women burns like a steady flame, but the fuel never goes dry. `
`Men's arguments are fierce but short! `
`Quick and easy." `
`"...You're right. `
`...I hope Battler-san and Rudolf-sama... `
`...make up soon..." `
`"Oh, they will! `
`Haven't you heard Battler mentioning it all the time? `
`He always fights with his father! `
`This is just another of those fights. `
`The death of his mother and his father's remarriage have merely upset him." `
`"It sounds as though he's gone to live with his mother's parents, but after he's cooled his head for a few days, he'll come back. `
`It's like a kid running away from home, see?" `
`The two witches kept saying that Battler's fight hadn't been anything huge. `
`...If it had been a mere family quarrel, the rumors wouldn't have started in the first place. `
`Taking an optimistic view here isn't likely to prove useful... `
`"Either way, `
`this is a problem between Battler and his father. `
`If you're patient, time will heal all wounds! `
`There's no point in you feeling bad over it." `
`"Just because Battler happened to be absent today doesn't mean we can be sure he'll never come back. `
`All this means is that Rudolf came alone today." `
`"True. `
`Of course, he will be at the next family conference, as energetic as ever! `
`By then, Rudolf will probably bring that Kyrie here too. `
`Battler may be sulky about it, but I am certain that he will come as well!" `
`"...You're right. `
`...Yeah. `
`...I'm sure...you're right." `
`How nice would it be if they were right... `
`In fact, if I could, I'd like to flip through the calendar until autumn right now and check to see whether he does come to the next conference. `
`If he does, then all of my fears are groundless. `
`It would mean the rumor-mongering family members and servants have just blown things out of proportion... `
`If Battler-san was right here, I'd want to question him right away... `
`...Hey, it isn't true that you'll never come to Rokkenjima again, right...? `
`And then, if he said that of course he would come again, ...it would be such a relief... `
`I don't know the phone number for Rudolf-sama's house, but I could probably look it up if I tried. `
`However, as a servant of the family, I have no excuse for making such a call. `
`And anyway, I have no way of knowing the phone number for Battler's grandparents' house... `
`I can't do anything except wait for Rudolf-sama's family to come visit and hope that my fears are groundless... `
`However, will I be able to make it through the day feeling like this...? `
`No way. `
`I doubt I'll sleep a wink tonight. `
`Just waiting around, feeling like this, ...when I don't know when my next chance will come... `
`I can't do that... `
`Will it be next month? `
`Or the month after? `
`...In the worst case, I might have to wait until the next family conference. `
`And I have to wait that long...while holding back this suffocating feeling... `
`...I can't bear it... `
`"Hey, Shannon. `
`Sorry to ask this out of the blue, `
`...but when you made up your mind to do something by the next year, that something wasn't just quitting work as a servant on this island, right?" `
`"...Uh, ...that... `
`......" `
`I...made the decision to start a new life. `
`I didn't want keep on being a servant by force of habit. `
`I made the decision to step into a new life...and to leave my old life as a servant behind. `
`"And Battler promised that he'd come here on the day of your decision, right...?" `
`"...Ummm, `
`...yes..." `
`"Tact is not one of my strong points, so I shall speak frankly. `
`You made the decision and resolved yourself to starting a new life with Battler, correct...?" `
`"...A new life... `
`...with...Battler-san..." `
`"You are afraid that Battler will not come for you on the day of your decision. `
`However, there is more to that day of decision than just Battler coming to see you." `
`"It's also the day for you to show that you're determined to spend the rest of your life with him." `
`"This determination is something you must create for yourself. `
`It won't bear fruit simply because Battler shows up." `
`"...Shannon, `
`do you now have the determination to spend the rest of your life with him? `
`You decided to put it off until the next family conference because you didn't have that determination last time, right?" `
`"What does it mean to live life with Battler? `
`Have you ever thought seriously about it in detail?" `
`"Well, ...uh..." `
`As long as I'm working as a servant on Rokkenjima, my opportunities for meeting him are limited. `
`We're both underage, so it's too early to talk about...umm...marriage. `
`However, if I quit working as a servant, I should have many more opportunities to meet him. `
`Once I quit work here, ...I'll return to the Fukuin House. `
`I have my wages from serving the family, so I should have more than enough to travel to Battler-san's house to play. `
`And when I graduate from school, I can rent an apartment near Battler-san's house. `
`Then, well, ...I can work while going to school. `
`That life would be a lot more difficult than I first thought. `
`...However, I'd be able to see Battler-san much, much more often. `
`If not every day, then every week. `
`I won't be a servant anymore, so there won't be any difference in class. `
`...I can call him whenever I want. `
`And I'm already doing both school and work. `
`Thanks to my experience here, I know more than enough to do simple housework... `
`"...Doesn't that sound like a fun life? `
`You can rent a humble abode, and once you've built up your own home, you can invite Battler over." `
`"And then, the time you spend together, the world the two of you make, will begin. `
`Doesn't that sound wonderful?" `
`"...Y- `
`Yes. `
`...It does sound a bit... `
`...wonderful..." `
`This was the first time I had ever imagined that future clearly. `
`My love for him, and my honest desire to live my life with him. `
`...Earlier, I was able to consider both of these deeply. `
`However, now that I'm clearly imagining the future I plan to choose, I finally understand. `
`I must be aware of how much determination will be needed to reach that future. `
`"You dream of marriage `
`eventually, don't you?" `
`"Hoh! Hoh! `
`Girls these days, dating with marriage in mind at such a young age...!" `
`"W-Well, that's a bit, umm...!" `
`"Don't deny your dreams, okay? `
`There's no point in taking a first step if your eyes are closed and you don't look to the future." `
`"If a girl's in love with a man, there's nothing wrong with thinking "I wanna marry him"! `
`That's a young girl's natural right." `
`My face had turned bright red. `
`Earlier, I thought that considering marriage really was a bit premature, so I tried as best I could not to think about it. `
`...However, when the witches encouraged me to imagine it, that image was both exciting and vivid. `
`I felt an indescribable feeling of refreshment and awakening, `
`...like the gentle breeze that washes over you when you go outside during a brief spot of sunshine on a rainy day. `
`That's right, I didn't actually have the determination to go that far. `
`I need to strengthen my determination by the time the next family conference comes around. `
`If I can't do that, then sticking around as a servant on this island is no more than I deserve. `
`"And at the same time, this is also a trial." `
`"True. `
`A trial to be overcome." `
`"...A trial...? `
`Why is that...?" `
`"Fool. `
`Battler promised that he would come for you at the next family conference, did he not?" `
`"He said he'd come on a white horse, right?" `
`"...Y-Yes..." `
`"You're thinking that Battler will not come anymore. `
`In other words, you have no faith in Battler's promise." `
`"That's why this is a trial. `
`To pass through this trial, you'll have to show that you can trust him and wait." `
`"......A trial..." `
`I hadn't thought of it that way. `
`Since he promised to come for me in a year... `
`Then I need to believe that he'll come for me in a year. `
`...If I doubt that, I don't have the right to wait for him in the first place. `
`............ `
`"In fact, Battler might have left the Ushiromiya family... `
`because he's set his sights on a future with you." `
`"Oh, why would that be?" `
`"If he knows that you will live together and eventually exchange marriage vows, `
`having the name Ushiromiya would cause problems, since Shannon is a servant of the Ushiromiya family." `
`"Ah, I see! `
`He realizes that there'll be all kinds of trouble if he decides to marry a servant girl, so he's abandoned the Ushiromiya name beforehand...!" `
`"What do you think, Shannon?! `
`That way, everything makes sense! `
`Battler has abandoned the Ushiromiya name for your sake! `
`This sudden argument with Rudolf was just an excuse." `
`"What splendid reasoning! `
`Nice going, Riiche!" `
`"Wahahahahahahahahaha...! `
`What do you say, Shannon? `
`There's no reason to feel down! `
`On the contrary, it's as though Battler has shown his determination first!" `
`"...*giggle* `
`...*giggle*giggle*giggle*..." `
`A smile had finally returned to my face. `
`{n}Of course, I hadn't taken the witches seriously and let myself be reassured. `
`It was closer to the opposite. `
`It was almost funny that they could think up such ridiculously convenient explanations for everything. `
`However, they had made all of those ridiculous theories to cheer me up. `
`...The witches are right when they say that I must trust Battler-san... `
`and that there's no point moping about just because I've heard a few rumors. `
`Until the next family conference, I intend to strengthen my resolve. `
`And, ...I believe that he'll accept my feelings and come for me. `
`The idea that Battler left the family so that he could be married to me some day... `
`...was laughable, of course. `
`But right now, I should try and feel confident enough to accept even crazy ideas like that. `
`"...Thanks so much. `
`...I feel a little better now." `
`"That is well. `
`I cannot stand watching you cry yourself to sleep." `
`"Thanks for coming into my dreams to encourage me." `
`"Indeed. `
`...It will be morning soon. `
`This is all a dream. `
`You won't remember any of it when you wake. `
`However, your heart will be at peace." `
`"......Yes. `
`...I'll believe in him...and wait. `
`...So, I won't listen to every little rumor." `
`"Very good. `
`Wait until the next conference while improving yourself. `
`If you think of it as training to become a wife, all of your everyday chores will grow more meaningful!" `
`"*giggle* `
`...Thanks a lot." `
`"...Riiche, `
`it'll be morning soon." `
`"Is that so? `
`Then so long, Shannon. `
`...You may not remember me, `
`but I will always be by your side, watching over you..." `
`"Thank you... `
`...Yes, thank you..." `
`"...The next family conference will be here in a flash. `
`...Wait for it at your leisure... `
`Battler will certainly keep his promise..." `
`"Pleased to meet you. `
`...My name is Kyrie. `
`I hope we can all become quick friends." `
`"I've known your name longer than I've known Asumu-san's. `
`I hear you're Rudolf's old girlfriend." `
`"*giggle* `
`Yes, we've known each other for quite a long time..." `
`"...Welcome to the Ushiromiya family. `
`I hope you find it easy to grow comfortable here." `
`"Yes. `
`I'd like to grow comfortable quickly, so that I can support my husband." `
`"But look at how cute that little girl is. `
`What's her name...?!" `
`"This is Ange-chan. `
`What a cute name." `
`"......So, you two couldn't make up after all." `
`"I thought this would be the perfect chance to bring him back, but... `
`...He's as stubborn as Dad." `
`"Will Battler-kun ever come back...? `
`I'll miss him." `
`"Nothing wrong with a man havin' enough backbone to find his own way in the world. `
`I'm sure he'll have made it big by the time he comes back...!" `
`"You think so? `
`Right now, Battler-kun's home isn't home for him. `
`The place he comes home to is somewhere else now." `
`"...Enough. `
`This concerns Rudolf's family only. `
`It is not our place to meddle." `
`"Thank you, Krauss nii-san. `
`...This is an issue for our family alone. `
`However, I intend to do all I can to see that Battler-kun and Rudolf-san can live together again someday. `
`After all, he's Ange's one and only big brother." `
`"...Yep. `
`When that kid gets stuck on something, anything you say to him will have the opposite effect. `
`...Asumu's father has a bit of a short temper. `
`Looks like he's been adding fuel to the fire." `
`"It'll be okay. `
`I'm sure he'll understand your feelings before too long." `
`"We can't do anything except cheer you on. `
`...Even if he doesn't come back, we're all prayin' that the two of you will make up quickly." `
`"...It's a bit boring without Battler." `
`"Yeah. `
`...I hope he and Uncle Rudolf can make up soon." `
`"...Thinking about how Battler-sama feels, ...it must have hurt." `
`"His family basically got swapped around. `
`...It probably doesn't feel comfortable at home anymore." `
`"All men need to go out on their own one day or another. `
`It might just be that Battler-kun's time has come." `
`"Do you think so...?" `
`"I do. `
`It's not cool for a guy to hang around at his parents' for too long. `
`You've got to leave the nest in a flurry and make your name in the world. `
`...I planned to do that eventually, but it looks like he's gone and done it first." `
`"A-And when he makes his name in the world and becomes a great man, ...will he come back?" `
`"It may be...that he never comes back. `
`After all, this might be leaving the nest to him." `
`"...Leaving the nest......" `
`"Battler didn't come, did he..." `
`"Oh, how terrible. `
`And I kept telling Shannon that he was sure to come. `
`...I'm sure she's very upset over Battler's absence. `
`And it's all because I got her hopes up...!" `
`"She's been looking forward to this day... `
`It pains me to think of how she must feel." `
`"......Thanks, you two. `
`...I'm...okay." `
`I had been reunited with the witches once again in that dream world. `
`...Though I could never remember anything during the day, now that I was in the dream world, I somehow knew that this was a reunion. `
`The witches both looked apologetic. `
`Though they had tried to cheer me up by saying that Battler would come today, `
`now that he hadn't come, it was like they'd been lying, and they seemed to regret it heavily. `
`"Shannon, `
`...umm... `
`...well..." `
`"...Thanks for your concern. `
`I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sad, `
`...but I'll be okay." `
`"A-Are you sure? `
`Really sure? `
`...That would be splendid, but..." `
`"Clearly, Battler's fight was so over-the-top that he couldn't bring himself to back down so soon. `
`Men are so stubborn." `
`"Y-Yes, that is true...! `
`He tried to act tough before running away, so his stubbornness is preventing him from taking back what he said so easily! `
`He'll probably regret not coming today. `
`Yes, that must be it...!" `
`For some reason, ...they seemed nearly desperate in their attempts to encourage me. `
`It was almost funny to watch. `
`...I couldn't help but giggle. `
`"Thanks a lot, both of you. `
`After all, ...you're the ones who told me in the first place. `
`That this is a test, ...a trial to be overcome." `
`The truth was, I couldn't really fool myself so easily. `
`When will he come back? `
`When will he come for me? `
`When...isn't the question. `
`...Will he come for me, ever? `
`If I start moping right now, the uncertainty and sadness will probably tear me apart. `
`But they've taught me. `
`This is...a trial to see whether I really believe in him or not. `
`The very fact that I feel uncertain and anxious is a betrayal of my resolve...and of his promise to come for me someday. `
`"George-sama said something about it. `
`...He said this might be the same as leaving the nest for Battler-san." `
`"That's right. `
`This is his chance to leave behind the Ushiromiya name and spread his wings as his own man." `
`"If you really think about it, ...we're still very young. `
`Even if we want to be tied together, we're still lacking many years of social experience and trust. `
`If Battler-san is really and truly taking this seriously, ...then it's too soon for him to come for me now." `
`"Well done. `
`Yes, that's the right attitude...! `
`You have done well to reach this understanding." `
`"...I haven't reached anything... `
`...However, I've decided to think of it that way for now. `
`This is a trial...to see whether I trust Battler-san or not." `
`If he had come today, `
`...then today, I would have had to tell Madam that I wanted to quit my job as a servant. `
`However, was I really prepared to do that? `
`Last night, I kept worrying about whether Battler-san would come or not. `
`Thanks to that, not only did I not have the resolve to quit my job, I hadn't even started on the paperwork to do so. `
`...In short, I still don't have the "determination" that I promised him that day. `
`I'm sure that God knew that. `
`Battler will come for me when I've found my determination. `
`I wasn't determined, so it's only natural that he didn't come today... `
`............ `
`...Yeah. `
`...It all makes sense now. `
`"So, `
`...I'm sure Battler-san didn't come today...because I wasn't determined enough. `
`It's only natural, since I couldn't even truly believe that he would come..." `
`"I'm sure Battler was the same way. `
`He did not yet have the determination and resolve to come for you." `
`"...God is not heartless. `
`When your feelings truly do draw close, I'm sure they'll bring the two of you together." `
`"Just like Orihime and Hikoboshi...!" `
`"Yes, it's as though the weather just happened to be bad during this year's Tanabata, keeping those lovers apart for another year... `
`...That's how I'd like to think about what happened today." `
`That's how...I'd like to think about it. `
`...I have no other choice. `
`............ `
`...Battler-san... `
`"But Battler-kun didn't come back for..." `
`"Six years. `
`...Still a long way to go until then." `
`"...So, you had to wait six whole years feeling like that...?" `
`"When one waits every year for something to happen the next, and then the same thing the next year and the next, `
`...it becomes the same as waiting for an eternity." `
`"...Pretty pathetic, don't you think? `
`After all, this promise you thought you made with Battler seems to be something he knew nothing about, right?" `
`"Battler-kun does tend to use melodramatic phrases, just like Uncle Rudolf. `
`...His roundabout way of putting things might have led to a misunderstanding..." `
`"Some girl's gonna stab Battler in the back someday. `
`...Well, I guess that's more or less what this tale is." `
`"...When words can mean different things, they can turn a person's life upside-down. `
`...There are times when careless talk costs lives." `
`"............" `
