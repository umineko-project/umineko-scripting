`"So, did you figure out `
`who killed Beatrice?" `
`"Yeah. `
`More or less." `
`"You don't mean the Head, `
`do you?" `
`"{f:5:Bernkastel} isn't asking about the two Beatrices involved with Kinzo. `
`She's talking about who killed the {f:5:Beatrice} of 1986." `
`"...I'm not really sure what you mean by "the {f:5:Beatrice} of this year". `
`What's all this about a witch called {f:5:Beatrice}? `
`And then there's what we were just talking about, and that epitaph too. `
`Isn't it about time you explained all this to me?" `
`"All right. `
`No point stringing you along." `
`"Let's start from the beginning. `
`...Who is this witch {f:5:Beatrice}?" `
`"Strictly speaking, it isn't a person. `
`It's the concept known as "{f:5:Beatrice}, the Golden Witch"." `
`"You mean the ghost stories themselves?" `
`"To be more specific, even the ghost stories are only one of the elements that create the concept." `
`"You've lost me." `
`"Ghost stories are normally told in the second-person or third-person. `
`However, someone started telling those in the first person." `
`"You mean someone started claiming that they were {f:5:Beatrice}...?" `
`"The legend of Rokkenjima's evil spirits, and the made-up story for keeping kids out of the forest... `
`These were combined with Kinzo's constant cries of "Beatrice, Beatrice" and gradually became the legend of the witch. `
`Ushiromiya Maria became entranced by that fictional witch and begged for a chance to meet her. `
`...And then, someone `
`answered her call." `
`"...I'm still not following, but I'll just nod and tell you to keep going. `
`...What do you mean by "answered her call"?" `
`"Because of Ushiromiya Maria's unfortunate childhood history, she became obsessed with the occult. `
`...Someone felt sympathy for her, acted the part of {f:5:Beatrice}, and played with her." `
`Maria tends to recognize people by their behavior, rather than their physical appearance. `
`Though Rosa is only one person, Maria calls her mother "the black witch" when she gets violent, and at these times, Maria views Rosa as a different person, separate from her mother. `
`In other words, `
`even when a person visually looks the same, she tends to view them as multiple different people depending on their attitude. `
`This fact puts the scene where Maria first met {f:5:Beatrice} in a new light. `
`After being chased out of the mansion by the adults, Maria decided to have some tea in the rose garden. `
`At that time, someone probably started talking to Maria. `
`Then, ...when they heard this occult-loving girl talking happily about how she wanted to meet the witch {f:5:Beatrice}, `
`...this person acted as though {f:5:Beatrice} was possessing them. `
`On the outside, they didn't look like {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`However, when their manner of speech and behavior changed abruptly, Maria would recognize them as a different person. `
`That's why "her" appearance was so sudden. `
`"We can probably view Maria's love of witches and the occult as a form of escapism. `
`...She believed the power of witches could bring about change in her unfulfilling and incomplete life. `
`That's why she wanted to believe that witches exist. `
`She thought that believing could make her happy." `
`"...It's true that Aunt Rosa brought up Maria by herself, and that she was always busy with work. `
`I do feel sorry for Maria, but still..." `
`"Don't neglect the heart. `
`...Maria believed for the sake of believing. `
`She believed in {f:5:Beatrice}'s conjuring trick from the bottom of her heart. `
`That probably comforted her a lot. `
`...And, at that moment, the witch {f:5:Beatrice} was born." `
`"Someone saw that Maria-chan wanted to meet a witch, so they decided to play witches with her...?" `
`"That's right." `
`This marks the birth of Beato the Elder. `
`All of that about living a thousand years and being bound to Rokkenjima... `
`That was mixed into the story of ghosts wandering the mansion at night, which was part of the legend of Rokkenjima's evil spirits. `
`As Furudo Erika guessed, the two ghost stories had fused. `
`Someone fused the two stories together and acted the part. `
`So, {f:5:Beatrice} held traits from both ghost stories: she was the master of the mansion's night, while also fearing spiderwebs. `
`"So, when {f:5:Bernkastel} asks us who killed {f:5:Beatrice}, `
`she means who killed the kind person who acted the part of {f:5:Beatrice}?" `
`"That's close, but not quite. `
`She doesn't mean someone acting a part. `
`We're talking about two different people. `
`...Just like how, in Maria's eyes, her mother and the black witch are different, separate people, `
`{f:5:Beatrice} and the person who played that part are also different people." `
`It was just like Mariage Sorci√®re. `
`One person would be the creator, and the other would acknowledge those creations, thereby nurturing the illusion. `
`The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} was also created by one person, and then nurtured when Maria acknowledged her. `
`"So, killing the role that was being acted out...wouldn't mean the same thing as killing the kind person who was playing the part?" `
`"Even if {f:5:Beatrice}'s vessel is lost, that isn't the same as {f:5:Beatrice} being killed. `
`...It's easier to understand if we use a telephone as an example. `
`Let's say I call you on the phone. `
`From my perspective during the call, the phone is you, in the sense that it's what I talk to." `
`"But what if I break the phone?" `
`"...I see. `
`If you kill the phone, you won't be able to talk to me, but that doesn't mean you've killed me." `
`"We know Maria once offered to let {f:5:Beatrice} possess her, early on in their relationship. `
`That clearly shows that {f:5:Beatrice} didn't look like the portrait at that time." `
`"So, if the person acting the part and the witch character they play are different people, ...we're talking about killing just the witch character itself. `
`...Is that even possible?" `
`"Only the actor can kill the character. `
`In other words, the person who killed {f:5:Beatrice} is the person who played the part of {f:5:Beatrice}." `
`"You mean that the person who played witches with Maria-chan is the culprit {f:5:Bernkastel}'s talking about?" `
`"That's it. `
`......But, as if that wasn't confusing enough, this chapel is now a world inside a cat box. `
`The culprit is the cat. There are now two cats existing at the same time: one alive, and one dead." `
`"...Confusing is right. `
`I'm still lost, but keep going. `
`You're saying that there are two culprits?" `
`"Right. `
`...The human who can create and kill {f:5:Beatrice}... `
`...and the human who never gave birth to {f:5:Beatrice} in the first place, who can kill the entire concept of {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`Both of those humans are here." `
`"Then let me ask. `
`In this {f:5:Beatrice} murder case, `
`who are the two culprits?" `
`"Let's start with `
`the dead cat." `
`"Who is it?" `
`"You." `
`"...Wh- `
`What `
`...?" `
`"It's painfully easy to guess. `
`Your world is the only one where the witch {f:5:Beatrice} doesn't exist." `
`"I don't understand." `
`"Both Maria and Jessica told me stories about the witch {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`However, when they talked about the ranking system at the dining table, you weren't there." `
`"I...wasn't there...?" `
`"Maria came to visit Rokkenjima with Rosa. `
`And Rosa was sitting next to her. `
`That's impossible. `
`...If you exist, then Lion comes after Rosa, then Jessica, then Maria." `
`There should be two people between Rosa and Maria in rank. `
`In that case, they should be sitting on opposite sides of the table and separated by one seat. `
`...In other words, in the world where Lion exists, it's impossible for Maria to be sitting next to Rosa. `
`"It was the same in Jessica's story. `
`If you were added to the ranking system, then when looking down the table towards Kinzo's seat, you should be on the left side and Jessica should be on the right. `
`After that comes George on the left side and Ange on the right. `
`...Jessica and Ange will be sitting next to each other whether you're there or not. `
`However, which side of the table they're sitting on changes." `
`In the world where Lion exists, Ange's seat is on Jessica's left. `
`However, if Lion doesn't exist, then Ange's seat is on Jessica's right. `
`"Every time someone talked about the witch {f:5:Beatrice} of 1986, they were all talking about a world where you don't exist. `
`And, in your world, there are no ghost stories about a witch. `
`To you, Beatrice is either Kinzo's mistress or his benefactor, not a wandering ghost." `
`"The Head loved Beatrice deeply, did he not? `
`I can't imagine why she would be made into a ghost story." `
`"Exactly. `
`If you exist, the witch {f:5:Beatrice} doesn't. `
`Your existence `
`"kills {f:7:Beatrice}"." `
`"Are you saying I'm the culprit who killed {f:5:Beatrice}...? `
`That's...just crazy. `
`How can I be the culprit if I don't even understand her and have never met her?" `
`"Flip it around. `
`...If you don't exist, {f:5:Beatrice} will be born." `
`"Flip it? `
`Are you trying to say {f:5:Beatrice} and I are two sides of a coin?" `
`"That's a good way to put it. `
`That's it exactly. `
`You're a coin, and {f:5:Beatrice} is on the other side." `
`"I don't get it at all." `
`"At first, I didn't get your existence either. `
`...But, I've formed a theory about you, after hearing all this. `
`The key is that you're 19 years old." `
`"...I don't remember telling you my age, but you got it right. `
`...How?" `
`"Jessica said you were already the student council vice-president when she joined your school...and that you became the president the next year. `
`That means you're one year older than Jessica." `
`Jessica is 18 years old, ...so Lion must be 19. `
`"I see... `
`And what sort of theory can you make, now that you know I'm 19?" `
`"The theory I can make...is that you aren't Ushiromiya Natsuhi's child." `
`"...... `
`...How rude. `
`I don't know what game you're playing, but I won't allow you to insult both me and my mother like that." `
`"Why are you the Successor, instead of Krauss?" `
`"I will succeed the Headship when I come of age. `
`When I have a kid, I'll probably pass the title down to them when they come of age." `
`"Then why didn't Kinzo give the Headship to Krauss when he came of age?" `
`"......You heard what our Head said. `
`He was used by the cunning elders of the Ushiromiya family and suffered much. `
`That's why he decided that only young people should inherit the Headship from now-" `
`"In the world without you in it, there is no silver ring for the Successor. `
`...That silver ring proves that Kinzo had a strong desire, which he didn't show in any other world, `
`to see that you became the next Head." `
`"...I can't deny that you may have a point there. `
`The Head always seemed to adore me particularly, `
`and I was very young when he first promised to make me the Head when I came of age. He was very strict when he told me to keep up in my studies in preparation for that day." `
`"...But I don't think my father was any less talented. `
`Why did Grandfather skip over him and make me the Successor? `
`......I've thought it strange from time to time, but since it's always been that way, I never said so aloud." `
`"Do you know why Kinzo wanted you and not Krauss to become the next Head?" `
`"How could I know? `
`...Are you trying to tell me to stop neglecting the heart again? `
`Do you think you understand how the Head's heart works?" `
`"It's because you're the child of Kinzo and Beatrice." `
`"...Well done. `
`...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*." `
`There was a crisp applause and a mocking laugh. `
`"{f:5:Bernkastel}." `
`"...That was faster than I expected. `
`I thought you'd let me play a bit longer." `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} appeared sitting on the altar, `
`...almost as though it had become her own personal chair. `
`"When did you realize that Lion shared Beatrice's blood?" `
`"As soon as I realized that Lion was 19. `
`...It was the same number as "the baby from 19 years ago", the hint that appeared in the 5th game." `
`"...Didn't that baby fall off a cliff?" `
`"Lion is the baby who was accepted by Natsuhi and didn't fall off the cliff. `
`In other words, if Natsuhi rejects the baby, Lion doesn't exist." `
`"You're saying...I'm not Mom's child...?! `
`That's insane... `
`......" `
`"You say that, but you don't look too sure. `
`...*giggle* `
`That's right. `
`Ushiromiya Lion is not Natsuhi's child. `
`This is the grown-up version of the baby Kinzo got from somewhere 19 years ago." `
`"Not "somewhere". `
`...Lion clearly shares Beatrice's blood. `
`The proof is the silver ring, which is only ever given to Lion across all of the many worlds." `
`"Why does the ring prove that I share Beatrice's blood?" `
`"In all of the many worlds, you are the only one who receives it. `
`That means that, in all worlds, you are the most important person to Kinzo, second only to Beatrice. `
`And his love for you is clearly greater than it is for his son, Krauss, or his granddaughter, Jessica. `
`And you are 19 years old. `
`...In other words, if we look back to see what happened 19 years ago, it can lead to a certain theory." `
`"19 years ago? `
`What's supposed to have happened at the time I was born?" `
`"...You heard it too, didn't you? `
`You even heard it today. `
`And Will was with you, right?" `
`"...... `
`...You don't mean...Aunt Rosa's story?!" `
`"That's right. `
`Rosa's story came out in the 3rd game, and when the age of the baby in the 5th game matched that date, a certain theory became possible. `
`The fact that Kinzo brought a baby from somewhere and tried to add it to his family... `
`proves that the baby was somehow important to him." `
`"And I'm... `
`the child... `
`...of the Kuwadorian Beatrice..." `
`"The Kuwadorian Beatrice was the daughter of the Beatrice who arrived in that submarine. `
`...But Kinzo didn't think of her as a daughter. `
`He believed she was the same person, Beatrice reborn. `
`...When that "reborn Beatrice" reached the same age as the first Beatrice, and truly looked like Beatrice's double... `
`Kinzo made a terrible mistake." `
`"...I-I don't want to hear it!" `
`"That's how it is. `
`Kinzo got Beatrice pregnant with Beatrice, `
`and then he got that Beatrice pregnant with you. `
`...So, you're both Kinzo's child and Beatrice's grandchild." `
`".........!" `
`"If we consider Kinzo's heart, this is the inevitable theory we reach for explaining why he treated you so specially. `
`He regretted his mistake so much that he tried to make you his proper grandchild." `
`"...In almost all cases, Natsuhi's pride is brutally hurt, and she refuses to raise Lion. `
`Because of that, you almost always fall from the cliff and disappear." `
`"...I-I heard... `
`...that I was the child they were finally blessed with after so long... `
`and that Jessica was born the next year..." `
`"If you really never suspected that Natsuhi wasn't your mother, `
`...then you should thank her in this world. `
`The reason you never realized the truth is because she's shown as much affection to you as she did to Jessica." `
`"...There's no need to thank her. `
`...After all, it took a dizzying span of time just to find a Fragment with you in it. `
`Mathematically speaking, `
`there's actually a 2,578,916/2,578,917 chance of her refusing to raise you. `
`You should probably be thanking me for creating this miracle, not Natsuhi. `
`...*giggle*giggle*." `
`"Enough with your stupid probability games." `
`"Oh, I'm sorry." `
`"............" `
`"No matter whose blood you bear, that doesn't change the debt you owe to the family that raised you." `
`"I realize that. `
`...Still, I would like some time to calm down and think things through. `
`...That is, if you'll refrain from ignoring my heart." `
`"...Sure." `
`Lion took a deep breath and looked upwards. `
`...Anyone would be shocked... `
`to find that their parents weren't who they believed them to be. `
`Still, Lion should be grateful. `
`Grateful towards the family that raised a child who wanted for nothing... `
`"It is pretty interesting. `
`...Hard to believe that the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} might've lived such an ordinary life, `
`even at such absurdly low probabilities." `
`"Isn't it? `
`I think moments like this are hilarious..." `
`Will had said it plainly. `
`Ushiromiya Lion...is how the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} appears in a different world. `
`The baby Natsuhi rejected 19 years previous... `
`If she'd accepted that child, this is the future that would have occurred... `
`However, if she doesn't accept that child, ...the witch will be born. `
`The baby whose birth was not celebrated becomes a witch... `
`"Lion is the dead cat. `
`...However, Lion's existence has nothing to do with what you're interested in, the Rokkenjima Serial Murders. `
`...In other words, Lion is the cat that disappears when you open the cat box." `
`"...*giggle* Exactly. `
`Lion is just a disappearing cat. `
`But this was pretty fun for a side-trip, don't you think?" `
`"You're the only one having fun. `
`...If I wasn't trapped here, I wouldn't even worry about reasoning this out." `
`"...... `
`...I think I know why I was chosen to be your partner in this strange detective game. `
`...It seems this {f:5:Bernkastel} witch `
`enjoys toying with people's fates and sneering at them." `
`"Wow, incredible. `
`...It's rare for someone to understand me on the day we meet. `
`...*giggle*." `
`"Apparently, ...I become something that gets called a witch in another world. `
`And, apparently, I'm the cause of some sort of crime. `
`Is that my sin?" `
`"It's no sin of yours. `
`You are you. `
`How things would be if the coin were flipped the other way isn't your problem." `
`"Thank you. `
`Even so, I don't think anyone would be pleased to hear `
`that they caused some sort of trouble in a world of a different fate. `
`...Please, tell me. `
`What do I do in that other world?" `
`"......{f:5:Bernkastel}?" `
`"Should we show the Fragments to this kid?" `
`"............" `
`Will opened his hand... `
`and something that looked like a pale-blue, glowing shard of a crystal appeared there. `
`It was a memory...no, a game record...of all the games so far. `
`"...Touch this. `
`You'll be able to see your fate in other worlds." `
`"...Your face is telling me... `
`that I'd be happier if I didn't touch it." `
`"Of course. `
`...You've probably guessed, but the story here isn't a happy one." `
`"Even so... `
`...Even if it is another world, ...it's still about me." `
`"...You have both the right to know and the right not to know. `
`If you can convince yourself that the one similar to yet different from you is a separate person, ...then touch it." `
`"Don't you want to know...? `
`About the fate you might've reached?" `
`"......I ask this as your partner. `
`Would you show that to me?" `
`"As your partner, I'd say "look". `
`...But as a friend, I'd say "don't"." `
`"Unfortunately, `
`I'm not your friend." `
`"Then, as a partner, I have one last question." `
`"What?" `
`"Are you... `
`...a boy or a girl?" `
`"...Well, that was abrupt." `
`"I could see you as a fairly slender boy. `
`But then again, I could also see you as a no-nonsense sort of girl. `
`...Even {f:5:Bernkastel} has been intentionally keeping it a secret. `
`She made Jessica call you "our Successor-sama" all the time, instead of Nii-san or Nee-san." `
`"...*giggle* `
`You are quick." `
`"People often ask me about my gender. `
`So, I always give the same irritated response. `
`...Which do I look like to you?" `
`"...In the 5th game, you're supposed to be a boy. `
`But in many other games, you're thought of as a girl. `
`...In the sixth game, when Ushiromiya Battler was the Master, two demons of different sexes appeared, but we didn't know which was which. `
`...In fact, strictly speaking, it started all the way back in the very first game. `
`......Your gender is one of the hidden mysteries that exists outside the games themselves." `
`"I'd hate to give you an answer so easily, so I won't. `
`We're partners, right? `
`Does it really matter if I'm not the gender you'd prefer?" `
`"...... `
`...You're right. `
`If we're working together on this, I don't care what your gender is." `
`"Thank you. `
`...I've developed a bit of a complex about it, so I'm glad to hear you say that." `
`"I'm all for gender equality. `
`......If someone's a waste of space, I'll smack 'em no matter who they are." `
`"And of course, I'll pinch rude people no matter which gender they are." `
`Slowly, ...Lion reached out and touched the Fragment. `
`A moment later, Lion seemed to undergo a violent bout of dizziness...and silently slumped over like a puppet with its strings cut. `
`It was no surprise. `
`When people who don't understand parallel universes have many different fates jammed into their heads, `
`they tend to feel like their brains are swelling and their sense of self is melting away. `
`...Lion seemed to have lost consciousness. `
`"So, ...Lion had what it took to learn everything." `
`"A perfect piece to be your partner, wouldn't you say?" `
`"I'll continue my reasoning. `
`...I've talked about the dead cat." `
`"Very true. `
`Next up is the living cat." `
`"The only one who can kill the {f:5:Beatrice} of 1986 is the one who created her." `
`"There are tons of hints. `
`If you think about it, they've been coming since back when {f:5:Beatrice} was running the games." `
`"That's true. `
`...In the 4th game between {f:5:Beatrice} and Battler, {f:5:Beatrice}'s origin became clear. `
`And, at that point, I learned who {f:5:Beatrice} was, and about that person's heart." `
`"What do you mean by heart?" `
`"...The motive. `
`...The reason why {f:5:Beatrice} had to commit a game-like crime on October 5th, 1986, `
`putting even her own fate on the line." `
`"Impressive. `
`So, you figured out the "who dunnit" and the "why dunnit" as early as the 4th game. `
`...Then what about the "how dunnit"?" `
`"Once you know who the culprit is, theorizing about the "how dunnit" isn't impossible. `
`...Those linked closed rooms in the third game were a pretty nice job. Almost made me feel like applauding." `
`"And the "who aaam I?", `
`from the end of the 4th game...?" `
`"The "culprit" who can kill everyone at 24:00 on October 5th, no matter where they are. `
`By that moment, it's possible to form a certain sort of hypothesis. `
`...You might call that the other treasure of the Golden Land." `
`"...Ooh? `
`So, you say you can reach all of the answers by the 4th game? `
`In other words, with just {f:5:Beatrice}'s games?" `
`"It's possible. `
`...After that, {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s game and Battler's game were filled with even more hints. `
`...As is this game of yours." `
`"*giggle*giggle*... `
`...Well now, why don't you stop stalling for time, and just tell me? `
`...Who iiis... `
`the culprit?`
`At that moment, ...though there hadn't been anyone but them in the chapel, small footsteps rang out. `
`That silhouette slowly walked up to Will and {f:5:Bernkastel}... and gave a small bow. `
`"......So, you've come." `
`"Did you call this person here?" `
`"Yeah. `
`..."Who dunnit". `
`"How dunnit". `
`And "why dunnit". `
`...I've understood this person's motive." `
`"...And are "you" going to give up just because he's found out your motive...? `
`There's no concrete evidence, right? `
`You could make a flashy fight of it, with red and blue." `
`"That's not what this person wants anymore." `
`They nodded slightly. `
`Their wish...was to be noticed. `
`Once that happened, they had no need for trivial excuses or pointless word games... `
`"I believe that I understand your motive, `
`...your heart. `
`...I'm going to describe it now. `
`I called you here... `
`to listen... `
`and correct me in your own words if I've gotten anything wrong." `
`"............" `
`The two of them nodded to each other once more. `
`"In your four games, I found your message. `
`...And in the three games with different Masters, I was able to picture the strange sort of fate that must have toyed with your life. `
`...It left me speechless. `
`...In every game, you die, without revealing that truth to anyone." `
`Having this person confess in this empty chapel might be pointless. `
`However, even so, ...I believe it will give her some sort of salvation. `
`People are only saved when someone understands them. `
`No one understood this pitiful witch even after her death, even years later, and including the man she wanted to understand her most. `
`......It's about time someone forgave her. `
`At the end of the 5th game, Battler finally understood. `
`...However, `
`...it took him so long, `
`...and he didn't make it in time. `
`So, even though she's alive here and now, Battler cannot save her. `
`So, Battler isn't here at {f:5:Beatrice}'s funeral. He won't come. `
`...He won't make it in time. `
`"...This is {f:5:Beatrice}'s funeral. `
`You will confess, `
`...the divine Master will hear, `
`...and I will forgive you. `
`...That's supposed to be Battler's job, but he didn't make it in time. `
`So, you'll have to settle for me." `
`"...And Beato gave Battler so many hints, too. `
`Lambda also gave that idiot a ton of hints. `
`...I even got a good laugh in at Battler's game of repentance for missing so much. `
`...But I won't make anyone laugh. `
`I'll just dispassionately...carry out your funeral." `
`"No more talking from you. `
`That's my job." `
`"......*giggle*." `
`"If you're ready, let's begin. `
`...No one will rush you. `
`......{f:5:Bernkastel} has closed off time for eternity until your funeral ends. `
`You have as much time as you need to prepare yourself emotionally..." `
`The silhouette slowly shook its head. `
`It had come here because it was already prepared. `
`Will nodded to show he understood. `
`...Then, the two looked into {f:5:Bernkastel}'s eyes, `
`...and Will spoke out clearly. `
`{a:c: `
`"This is the culprit."} `
