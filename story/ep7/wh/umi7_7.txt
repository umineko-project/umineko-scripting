`"Ah...heheh. `
`I apologize for our Successor-sama's lack of courtesy back there..." `
`"It's not going to leave a mark, is it? `
`Talk about merciless." `
`"...Did you say something, Jessica?" `
`"O-Of course not...! `
`I've already, uh, learned my lesson, okay?!" `
`Lion, who had apparently been chatting with the adult siblings, spun around with a smile and stared at Jessica. `
`...Looks like the older sibling's firmly in control around here. `
`"...Those are some sharp ears. `
`I think I'm finally getting this Lion person." `
`"Yeah, yeah, yeah! `
`Our Successor-sama's always been weirdly sharp! `
`And the adults are always gushing about that kid! `
`And I'm always getting compared to that, both at home and at school!" `
`"Come to think of it, Lion was the student council president during both middle school and high school. `
`And the head of the badminton team too." `
`"So everywhere you go, you get compared to Lion, and it doesn't match up too well for you." `
`"I said it as soon as I got into middle school. `
`Our Successor-sama was already the vice-president of the student council. `
`I said "if you're planning to become council president next year, that'll just put more pressure on me, so stop it!" `
`But the next year rolls around, and guess who announces their candidacy and wins by a landslide election?! `
`"Same thing again in high school! `
`I said "please, just give it a rest this time, you're already vice-president"! `
`But when year 3 rolls around, our Successor-sama gets the council president job again! `
`Dad was oh-so-proud! `
`Mom kept saying "now you make sure you do your best as the little sister", over and over and over again!! `
`Nngyaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!" `
`"But even so, you were still proud to be Lion's little sister, weren't you?" `
`"I-I-It's not like I ever thought of it that way! `
`Yeah, of course not, why would I...?!!" `
`"It can be tough to be compared against perfection. `
`But other people are other people, and you are you. `
`There's no point letting it get you down. `
`Live how you want to with all you've got, and you'll be fine." `
`"Of course! `
`But Mom and the others are always going on about how I need to follow in Ushiromiya Lion's footsteps as a little sister. `
`...They keep telling me to go join the student council, to go play badminton..." `
`"You don't play in a rock band, do you?" `
`"Wh-What?! `
`Sh-Shhhhhhh! `
`That's a secret, okay...?!" `
`Apparently, she's keeping it a secret from her family. `
`Interesting. `
`...People tend to blame things on their family and how they were raised, `
`but this Jessica girl always likes doing the same thing, even in a different world and a different family. `
`It's admirable that she has such a true and constant interest in something. `
`"I loved it. `
`That "pettan, pettan" song. `
`That "dokkyun, dokkyun" song." `
`"Wah, wah, wah!! `
`Shh, shh, shh!!" `
`Nothing wrong with the extraordinarily accomplished sort, like Lion, but kids who act their age do have their charms. `
`"That's the best way to go through life. `
`Enjoy your youth to the fullest." `
`"...Th-Thanks." `
`Apparently, no one had ever told Jessica that they approved of how she lived, `
`and the direct way Will had put it made her turn red and hang her head in embarrassment. `
`"I want to ask you two now." `
`"The same thing you just asked Maria-chan?" `
`"Yeah. `
`Please tell me everything you know about {f:5:Beatrice}." `
`"...Well, you can see how much Maria-chan loves witches and the occult. `
`For her, {f:5:Beatrice} is a symbol to be admired, like an anime heroine. `
`Whenever some trivial thing happens, she believes it's some witch pranking her with magic." `
`"You really are an adult. `
`And so is the fact that you'd never say that to Maria, even if you think it." `
`"Of course. `
`Childhood dreams only happen when you're a kid. `
`I think respecting that precious experience is an adult's responsibility." `
`"Looks like the two of us will get along well." `
`George's position was that {f:5:Beatrice} was nothing more than a fairy tale. `
`However, that phrase, ..."respecting a child's dreams is the adult thing to do"... That might be worthy of further scrutiny. `
`When she got candy from {f:5:Beatrice} by magic, Maria probably got excited and told George and the others. `
`Then, the adults followed his lead and actively supported that story "as adults should". `
`However, we can conceive of a similar situation coming up besides an adult interacting with a child. `
`For example, what about a subordinate interacting with a superior? `
`...If Kinzo, tyrant of the Ushiromiya family, claimed that {f:5:Beatrice} existed and had revived, `
`perhaps the other members of the family would actively support that story "as his subordinates should". `
`Though {f:5:Beatrice} only appeared directly in front of a limited number of people, `
`...it's probably safe to say that the concept of her existence penetrated deeply within the Ushiromiya family, even among those who had never seen her. `
`However, no matter how deeply that concept penetrated, she was only viewed as a sort of fairy tale character. `
`It would be necessary to transform the concept of that character from an imaginary fairy tale into reality. `
`So, a person attempting to do this would need to perform acts that no one could explain without magic. `
`These acts...were the witch incidents, starting with the window-opening pranks played by Beato the Elder... `
`and ending with the closed room murders. `
`...Beato the Elder talked about this, saying that the anti-magic power filling the mansion would be weakened bit by bit the more she made her existence known. `
`{f:5:Beatrice}. `
`Why were you willing to go so far to make everyone besides you accept your existence? `
`Because that fiction will become the truth if everyone acknowledges it? `
`Because at that moment, the being called {f:5:Beatrice} will be acknowledged and will become Human? `
`In that case, until {f:5:Beatrice} is acknowledged by all people, she's less than Human. `
`She's furniture. `
`Why would furniture want to become Human? `
`I seem to remember this being a theme in the previous game. `
`It's because...they want to gain a right. `
`Furniture cannot ****. `
`So, they try to become Human because they want the right to ****. `
`......... `
`It's extremely simple. `
`...After all, it's directly connected to the reason chick Beato was born in the first place. `
`"...... `
`...I see. `
`...I understand, but it's complicated." `
`Yeah, ...you can't neglect the heart. `
`"I feel bad for saying this at {f:5:Beatrice}'s funeral, `
`...but truth be told, I don't know enough about this person called {f:5:Beatrice} to tell you much about her. `
`My apologies." `
`"Jessica-chan does live here, so she might know a little more than I do. `
`...Speaking of which, have you introduced yourself to this gentleman yet, Jessica-chan?" `
`"Nah, not yet actually. `
`...There's this idiot going around pinching people's butts, so I didn't really have the chance...ehehe..." `
`A bit late, Jessica looked embarrassed for acting rudely in front of an unfamiliar guest. `
`She cleared her throat and made a beautiful bow that didn't fit well with her normal attitude. `
`She even lifted the corners of her skirt in a curtsy. `
`"P-Pleased to meet you. `
`...My name is Jessica. `
`Allow me to welcome you to the Ushiromiya family on this splendid day... `
`umm, I mean, please enjoy our hospitality...and..." `
`"...Willard. `
`Call me Will." `
`"Huh? `
`......Huh? `
`......Wah-" `
`Jessica's greeting had been of the old-fashioned sort, `
`so Will also treated her like an old-fashioned lady, `
`bending down on one knee, taking Jessica's right hand, and kissing it. `
`"Wah, wah...waah..." `
`Not expecting her greeting to be returned in such an old-fashioned and formal way, Jessica turned red and was unable to speak. `
`...However, Will had returned the greeting in what he thought was a perfectly serious way, `
`so he didn't understand what was making Jessica's face glow. `
`"Have I done something strange?" `
`"No, no, not at all...a-ahahaha..." `
`"I want to hear what you know about {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`......Nn." `
`A sparkle leaked around the edges of Will's right hand, which was grasping Jessica's hand. `
`Looks like the theatergoing power is having its effect on Jessica. `
`...Didn't mean for that to happen. `
`Oh well... `
`"{f:5:Beatrice}, is it...? `
`Well, I can tell you, ...but will you promise me something? `
`Promise you won't laugh. `
`Thinking about it now, ...it sounds more than a little crazy." `
`"What is it you know? `
`I won't laugh. `
`Tell me." `
`"S-Sure... `
`...Umm, where should I start..." `
`To me, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} is... `
`sort of like one of the "seven mysteries" of the Ushiromiya family. `
`You've heard of those, right? Almost all schools have a set of tall tales or ghost stories that get passed down. `
`Like "on some days, the piano in the music room will start playing by itself", or "the skeleton in the science room dances around at night". `
`Everyone's heard of them. `
`But of course, that doesn't mean they believe in them. `
`The stories about {f:5:Beatrice} were the same. `
`It was just one of those strange tales about our way-too-big mansion. `
`The servants would sometimes talk about seeing things during their night patrols. `
`Sometimes, I felt a bit annoyed about them turning my home into a place for ghost stories, but I didn't pay it any more attention than that. `
`That's how little it mattered to me. `
`So, during my normal, everyday life, I would completely forget about the name "{f:5:Beatrice}". `
`Of course, when that huge portrait was first hung, it definitely felt creepy. `
`Even I tried not to meet her eyes after dark, `
`so it's no surprise that the servants found it eerie. `
`But that only lasted for a short while. `
`We all walked by the portrait every day. `
`We gradually got used to it, and eventually bored of it. `
`I didn't really care anymore about the portrait of the mistress from Grandfather's delusions. `
`"I get that. `
`I'll bet it was different for the other relatives, who only came a few times a year." `
`"Exactly. `
`That's why every time the family came for a family conference, they'd always stand in front of that portrait and talk about {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`So, I was reminded of it every now and then." `
`"Uu-, {f:5:Beatrice}!! `
`I've come to play again...! `
`I've written a new spell. `
`Take a look at it later, okay?! Uu-!" `
`"You really do like {f:5:Beatrice}, don't you? `
`You've been in such high spirits ever since Grandfather had this portrait hung." `
`"Huh? `
`Where's Ange?" `
`"She went back with Aunt Kyrie to take some medicine." `
`"Her body really is frail. `
`...Totally the opposite of Battler." `
`"She's the sort that gets sick whenever she's stressed. `
`I also used to get sick on big holidays or trips." `
`"Maria's really tough by comparison. `
`...She's been talking about {f:5:Beatrice} non-stop since we left Niijima. `
`...Don't you think she's taking this a bit too far?" `
`"It's not so bad, right? `
`It's normal for kids to have an active imagination. `
`If a kid told you that she'd met Santa Claus, `
`would you tell her she's a liar?" `
`"...Well, of course I wouldn't go that far." `
`Maria kept talking to the portrait as though it was an old friend. `
`She promised to play with it later, as if she was talking to a living human. `
`George, a man, seemed to think that this behavior from a younger member of the opposite sex was cute. `
`...But, to be perfectly frank... `
`Jessica, who was the same sex as Maria, `
`found this behavior a bit unpleasant, even though she realized that she was dealing with a younger girl. `
`At one time, even I was fascinated by anime heroines and other fictional characters. `
`However, ...Maria's behavior seems to signify something more direct than mere fascination. `
`...It's something more definite, `
`...more vivid. `
`Am I the only one who notices something odd about her? `
`...I'll bet the others all notice too, but try to ignore it because of that adult dignity George nii-san is always talking about. `
`"...My apologies, everyone. `
`The Head is quite busy with his noble research. `
`He wishes to eat lunch in his study today." `
`Until a second ago, Kinzo's children had been complaining that eating lunch with their father would give them indigestion. `
`But now that they knew he wasn't coming, they started grumbling about how he should at least spare the time to come down during the annual family conferences. `
`"Then let us begin lunch, everyone. `
`I, Gohda, have made use of all my talent and experience `
`to make sure that you guests, who have come from so far away, will be entirely satisfied with your meal..." `
`No one's stomach would fail to rumble after hearing that from the Great Chef Gohda. `
`By the time the splendid dishes were laid out, everyone had stopped talking about Kinzo's absence... `
`It was now Ange's absence that was being discussed. `
`Apparently, her stomachache had gotten so bad that both she and Kyrie couldn't make it to lunch. `
`"Poor thing. `
`...Gohda, `
`make sure you talk to Kyrie-san later and have some porridge made." `
`"Thanks for the concern. `
`...Sorry about all this. `
`It seems she just can't handle much stress." `
`"That's how it is with young'uns. `
`They're cute, at least when they're not regurgitatin'." `
`"George used to do that all the time. `
`He really was frail, way back then. `
`Right?" `
`"Let's not talk about the past... `
`It's not exactly a mealtime topic." `
`"Uu-. `
`Poor Ange. `
`So she won't get to eat this yummy food?" `
`"Yeah, poor kid. `
`Let's make sure we play with her a lot when she gets better." `
`"Uu-, no way. `
`She can't play with me." `
`"Wh-What are you talking about? `
`Why?" `
`"Because I'm gonna play with {f:5:Beatrice}, of course. `
`So I can't play with Ange." `
`"Play with {f:5:Beatrice}... `
`...You mean you're gonna go off on your own again to mumble to yourself and read some book?" `
`Jessica slightly regretted that she hadn't been more tactful. `
`However, she couldn't wipe away that uncomfortable feeling she got every time Maria talked about {f:5:Beatrice}, `
`and that feeling slipped out through her words... `
`"Uu-!! `
`I don't do it on my own! `
`Beato is there too!!" `
`Maria may be young, but she does know how to read a person's tone. `
`She immediately burst out in anger, drawing the attention of everyone in the room... `
`Normally, Rosa would have stopped her at this point. `
`However, she happened to have gone to the bathroom at that moment. `
`So, there was no one to calm Maria down... `
`"Kihihihihi!! `
`Poor Jessica, you're just a clump of the toxin! `
`With Beato's weak magical power now, she'd burn to a crisp if she ever appeared in front of you! `
`But she will appear before you eventually. `
`Yes, in front of everyone else too!! `
`Kihihihi, and then the door to the Golden Land will open!! `
`But who knows if you'll be invited in? `
`Of course, she will take me there, to the Golden Land! `
`But not Jessica, not Jessica!! `
`Not someone who makes fun of {f:5:Beatrice}, not an unenlightened, stupid, confused, filthy, toxin-stained Human!! `
`Kihihihihihihihihihihhihhihhihhi!!" `
`"...When someone makes fun of {f:5:Beatrice}, it's like Maria becomes a totally different person." `
`"There was a theory about Maria having multiple personalities, wasn't there?" `
`"Multiple personalities! `
`Yeah, that probably describes it perfectly. `
`Or maybe that was Maria's idea of an ideal personality." `
`"You mean that thing about "creating another self" the way you want to be...?" `
`"Huh? ...How'd you know my motto?" `
`"Don't think too hard on it. `
`You'll just get a headache." `
`It was something Jessica once told Kanon. `
`She had been talking about how anyone can create another "self" in the image of the person they want to be. `
`...I think we heard those words somewhere near the beginning of the second game. `
`Now that I think about it, some very interesting stuff's been mentioned since very early on... `
`"Everyone has a "self" they really want to become. `
`But they can't do it. `
`...Their current self is always surrounded by their lifestyle and the limits placed on them, `
`so they have no way of changing themselves." `
`"True. `
`Changing yourself means changing your environment as well. `
`...That's not easy to do." `
`"So, my idea was to leave "who I am now" alone. `
`...I'd create another self, one that I really wanted to be." `
`"You felt suffocated, forced to live the life of a rich family's daughter, `
`and you envisioned the "self" that you wanted to be." `
`"But I couldn't do anything outlandish at home, of course. `
`Mom would just start yelling at me. `
`...So, I made my plan. `
`At home, I'd obediently do what my parents said, `
`...but I'd also create a second "self" to do what I wanted." `
`"At home, you did everything your parents told you to, and outside, you did what you wanted. `
`That's a good way to live. `
`You should be proud." `
`"Heheh, thanks... `
`And, well, ...if there's something you really want to be, and if you really work for it, it's easier to do than you'd think. `
`I figured Maria was pretty much the same." `
`"You think Maria's doing the same thing when she gets excited and starts talking and talking?" `
`"Sometimes, `
`I think that's the person Maria really wants to be." `
`"...As the youngest member of the family, she's adored, but not respected." `
`"Every time she learns something, there's always someone in the family who already knows it. `
`She doesn't get to show off her knowledge about anything. `
`...Whenever she does learn something new, we try to smile and praise her, `
`...but that might actually have hurt her." `
`"So, Maria wanted to become an authority on something?" `
`It's something that all young boys and girls think, when they want to shake off their childhood. `
`It's not a bad feeling when you learn something new and your parents praise you. `
`...But when you realize that your parents already knew that thing, it sometimes feels like they're talking down to you. `
`When a kid learns their one-digit times table, their parents will probably praise them. `
`However, inconsiderate parents will sometimes ask mean questions, like "then what is 11 times 11?" `
`or "what is 16 times 16?" `
`or something similar. `
`If that happens, the kid will lose his feeling of accomplishment...and will start to feel as though he could never surpass his parents... `
`"So, it's easy to guess why Maria got interested in the occult, something no one else knew about, `
`and started learning more and more about it. `
`...I think the person Maria wants to be `
`is an authority on the occult who everyone respects." `
`"And if she talked about the occult during her everyday life, Rosa would hit her. `
`...So, like you, she's been hiding this other "self" most of the time." `
`"That's what I think she's doing at times like this. `
`...Maybe I should say that this is her real self slipping through the cracks to cover up her normal self. `
`Actually, I've had some experience with that myself. `
`...I've thought at times that it'd be nice to become a frail, secluded lady, ...so I'd pretend to cough a lot, and it sort of became a bad habit." `
`"Because everyone would be nice to you if you started having coughing fits?" `
`"Haha, no... Whenever the conversation turned to something I didn't like, or something that made me feel uncomfortable, I could do that to change the subject." `
`"I see. `
`And that's another "self" you wanted to become." `
`"Haha, I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone about that." `
`Then, `
`...just what is Maria's "other self"? `
`An authority on the occult who can out-argue even adults? `
`Or else, ...does it have to do with her relationship with witches? `
`...Either way, denying {f:5:Beatrice} in front of Maria is clearly taboo. `
`...In her search for something more than her everyday life, `
`Maria found it in {f:5:Beatrice} and inside herself. `
`In that case, is going to the Golden Land with {f:5:Beatrice}... `
`Maria's wish? `
`............ `
`"Looks like we've gone off track. `
`Anyway, Maria kept up that tantrum until Aunt Rosa got back. `
`...I should've let her be, but I fought back." `
`"You said there was no way {f:5:Beatrice} could exist?" `
`"Something like that. `
`"If she exists, then just let me see her". `
`...Of course, once Maria started crying, I realized I'd gone too far." `
`"And then?" `
`"At the end of the family conference, I was the only one still upset. `
`...Maria acted as though nothing had happened. `
`Instead, she went off somewhere on her own...and came back talking happily about how she'd played with {f:5:Beatrice} again." `
`"Everyone, me included, decided not to contradict her. `
`By that time, it was best to just accept it and ignore it." `
`"Is that all you have to say about the family conference?" `
`"About the conference, yes. `
`What I want to talk about is what happened after the conference was over and everyone left." `
`Even after the conference ended, I still felt a bit uncomfortable. `
`If Maria had just stayed mad, `
`we would've made up with each other, and I could've put it all behind me. `
`But since Maria got over it, it felt like I was the only one unsatisfied... `
`"Oh, Milady. `
`Why the gloomy face?" `
`"...Oh, it's you. `
`It's nothing important. `
`...Did everyone make it back okay?" `
`"If they're still on schedule, they should have reached the Niijima airport by now. `
`...You've done your part well, Milady." `
`"I haven't done anything. `
`It's you servants who've done a great job." `
`"...... `
`Are you still upset by that fight you had with Maria-sama yesterday?" `
`"Nng, ...sorta." `
`"She's just a kid, right? `
`It's not something you need to worry about, all grown up and in high school." `
`"Do you think all that...was just a kid's nonsense?" `
`"...You mean... `
`about {f:5:Beatrice}-sama?" `
`"See, even you call her "sama"." `
`{f:5:Beatrice} is the name of Grandfather's mistress, the person he's still infatuated with. `
`...I realize that, as a servant, Kumasawa-san can't speak of her indiscreetly. `
`Still, ...that's now become the name of the fictitious witch who lives in this mansion, `
`...and it's almost natural for people to call her "sama". `
`"{f:5:Beatrice} is just a ghost story created by the adults to stop us from wandering into the forest. `
`...Maria just thought it was interesting one day and decided to act like it was true." `
`"Hohoho... `
`If you say such things, you'll end up regretting it. `
`After all, {f:5:Beatrice}-sama "exists"." `
`"Again, when you say stuff like that, you're just freaking me out. `
`I may not be George nii-san, but I'm not gonna go around shouting that Santa couldn't possibly exist. `
`But that doesn't mean he actually exists." `
`"...You'll find you're wrong there, Milady." `
`"Wrong...?" `
`"Oh yes. `
`The gods dwell in all things. `
`...In the same way, {f:5:Beatrice}-sama dwells in this mansion. `
`Like the gods, {f:5:Beatrice}-sama will do you no harm if you respect her. `
`As you say, it will be as though she doesn't exist... `
`However, if you ever fail to show proper respect, her curse will descend upon you. `
`...Of course, this doesn't apply only to {f:5:Beatrice}-sama." `
`"Heh, if there's a curse, let's see it. `
`I'd just love to meet her." `
`"M-Milady...! `
`You mustn't say such things...!" `
`"Ah, Milady..." `
`"You did a fine job today..." `
`"Shannon, Gohda-san. `
`You guys know about {f:5:Beatrice}, right?" `
`"...Huh?" `
`"W-Well, I do know of her, of course. `
`...Why do you ask?" `
`The two looked at each other. `
`They looked like a pair who had just heard a clueless person suddenly utter a forbidden word... `
`"Let's have it straight. `
`Does she exist? `
`That ghost?!" `
`"...If it's a question of whether she exists or not, `
`...I would have to say that she doesn't, `
`...probably." `
`"I... `
`...I'm sure... `
`...she exists." `
`"Why?! `
`Have you ever met her?" `
`"...I-I've never met her directly, ...but..." `
`Shannon spoke in detail of how she'd sometimes feel a strange presence or see a silhouette while doing the midnight rounds. `
`And each time she started, Jessica would immediately cut her off, `
`saying she must've seen it wrong or been mistaken. `
`"You haven't met her either, right, Gohda-san?!" `
`"...O-Of course not... `
`...However, `
`...well..." `
`He was being very evasive. `
`Even a man as big as Gohda was apparently unable to deny the existence of someone he'd never met. `
`...This really didn't sit well with Jessica. `
`She was a resident of this mansion herself. `
`They were acting as though someone else, someone she didn't know, was living here. `
`...Of course she didn't like it. `
`"Nn, wait a sec. `
`Tell me that story one more time." `
`"Huh? `
`Which do you mean...?" `
`"Th-The story about the VIP room...?" `
`Gohda and Shannon had been recounting several ghost stories about {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`One of those drew a reaction from Jessica... `
`"Yeah, that one. `
`Sounds pretty cool...!" `
`Gohda and Shannon glanced at each other. `
`After all, it hadn't been a "cool" story to either of them. `
`"You mean... `
`that you mustn't enter the VIP room `
`at 2:00 in the morning?" `
`"The one about how {f:5:Beatrice}-sama returns to the VIP room every morning at 2:00, `
`so you mustn't go near it?" `
`"Yeah, that's it. `
`Pretty cool. `
`All the other stories are about people saying they heard or saw something {f:5:Beatrice}-like, but this one isn't. `
`This one says that, if you go to the VIP room at 2:00, you can actually meet {f:5:Beatrice}-sama...!" `
`"W-Well, ...I-I wonder..." `
`"Milady... `
`They say that servants who speak ill of {f:5:Beatrice}-sama are cursed. `
`Furthermore, the VIP room is {f:5:Beatrice}-sama's room..." `
`"...Even you, Milady, ...should probably reconsider..." `
`"The VIP room is locked now, right? `
`Where's the key?" `
`"Was that key...in the key box...?" `
`"I-I think Genji-sama keeps that key by his own chair." `
`"The master key can unlock it too, right? `
`Let me borrow yours." `
`"B-But...I c-cannot do that...!" `
`"Milady, there's no need to approach such an ill-omened place without reason..." `
`"Hey, don't you go calling my house ill-omened. `
`Anyway, I've made up my mind. `
`If you can't give me your master key, there's still that key for the VIP room, right? `
`Let me borrow it." `
`"......M-Milady..." `
`To Jessica, the expressions worn by the pair felt more like an ill omen than anything else did. `
`In Jessica's eyes, the ill-omened thing wasn't the witch or the VIP room. `
`It was "them", Maria and the others who believed in witches. `
`In the end, Jessica forced them to agree, and she made them bring her the key to the VIP room... `
`"So you went on a classic test of courage, to see if {f:5:Beatrice} would really appear in the VIP room or not." `
`"Pretty much. `
`...Still, I wonder why I was so fixated on doing it. `
`I must still have been brooding over that fight I had with little Maria." `
`...Of course, the weather just had to be terrible on that particular night. `
`To be honest, I slightly regretted sticking my nose into something so pointless. `
`But I'd already said so much...and even borrowed the key from them. `
`I couldn't just go to Shannon the next day, have her ask me how it went, `
`and answer 'well, I gave up 'cause it was too scary, `
`tehehe...' `
`That'd just be pathetic. `
`Normally, I go to sleep long before 2:00 AM. `
`If Mom found me wandering the corridors at that time of night, she'd definitely yell at me. `
`So, I waited in my room, staring at the hands of my clock as it ticked closer to 2:00. `
`Outside, the rain was incredible, and the wind strong. `
`The swaying, rustling trees were particularly eerie. `
`I'd complained to Shannon and Gohda about making up ghost stories about my house, `
`...but I was starting to feel like those ghost stories might not be so impossible after all. `
`...The Ushiromiya mansion is huge. `
`Honestly, I can't think of the entire mansion as my own house. `
`As Mom says, the hallways of the Ushiromiya mansion should be treated like public roads. `
`In other words, my own room is part of my home, ...but the hallways and the rooms I don't usually enter are "outside". `
`So, while part of me felt that this VIP room ghost story was ridiculous, `
`...another part of me was so creeped out that it kept frantically trying to convince itself that the first part of me was right. `
`Only 10 minutes left 'til 2:00. `
`If I wanna be inside the VIP room at 2:00, I need to get there before then. `
`"...Guess it's time. `
`...Sorry, but I'm not giving up that easy." `
`Nothing's going to happen. `
`I know that. `
`It'll just be a stupid waste of time for a few minutes. `
`I touched the doorknob to the door of my room... `
`and was startled by how unpleasantly cold it was. `
`As long as I stayed in this room, I could laugh off anything. `
`After all, this was MY room. `
`But it wouldn't be like that in the hallway. `
`...That's...outside my territory. `
`And the doorknob, the barrier between the two, is ice-cold... `
`...Idiot... `
`What are you so scared of, me? `
`You aren't taking Shannon's, Gohda-san's, ...or maybe Kumasawa-san's gossip seriously, are you...? `
`I'll prove it! There's nothing strange in the VIP room...!! `
`The corridor was only dimly lit. `
`Before "lights out" time, the hallways were brighter. `
`But to avoid wasting energy or something like that, we kept the lights to a minimum at night. `
`So, even though I was inside my own house, `
`...it was very clearly "the middle of the night" here. `
`...If Mom found out that I was wandering around at a time like this to do a test of courage in the VIP room, which I'm not even supposed to go in, `
`I'd get in a lot of trouble. `
`To make sure she didn't find out, I tried to hide my breathing and my footsteps. `
`...So, the silence felt unbelievably loud. `
`Even though it was so quiet, ...that eerie sound of the wind was noisy. `
`The sound of twigs rustling. `
`The sound of some pillar in this old mansion creaking. `
`What's that sound like a beak tapping against glass? `
`Though it was so quiet, ...all of the little, suspicious sounds made it seem noisy. `
`Damn, I'm an idiot. `
`Why couldn't I have brought a flashlight, at least? `
`A flashlight to use inside my own home? `
`...Hah, that's even more idiotic... `
`I mumbled this to myself, hoping it would drown out the sound of the wind just a little... `
`......Then, ...I saw it. `
`The door to the VIP room. `
`...This was the VIP room, the room for important guests. `
`However, as far as I knew, it had never been used before. `
`None of the guests who came to this mansion...were important enough to be given use of this room. `
`Though I'd been clutching that key the whole time, it didn't feel warm at all. `
`It still ruthlessly and icily tormented me. `
`Or maybe that was a warning. `
`"...If you go back to your comfortable room and hide in your bed, this night will pass like any other..." `
`"...Don't mess with me. `
`I can't give up after coming this far." `
`Even though the key was freezing in my hand, telling me to go back... `
`...It slipped into the keyhole quite easily. `
`All that's left... `
`...is to turn the knob, `
`open it, `
`...and I'll be inside the VIP room. `
`...It's not like I've never been in there before. `
`Long ago, I explored and played hide-and-seek all the time, `
`and this room that I rarely entered seemed unusual and exciting. `
`However, I got in trouble for going in, and was told that this room was important, so one mustn't enter without reason. `
`After that, they made a rule of locking up unused rooms, and I couldn't go in anymore. `
`...So, ...it's probably been several years since I've gone into the VIP room. `
`In fact, ...it might be more than ten years since the last time. `
`The inside of the room has probably changed from how I remember it. `
`...Come to think of it, even then, I felt that there was something unsettling about it... `
`Slowly, I pushed the door open. `
`The door was light, ...and even after I let go of it, it kept opening by itself, as though beckoning me in... `
`Beyond it...was a darkness as thick and heavy as ink... `
`Even the dim light that peeked in from the corridor seemed bright in contrast. `
`...*gulp*. `
`...I stuck my head in, feeling about for the light switch next to the doorway. `
`This was a horribly awkward and uncomfortable way to do it. `
`All I really had to do was step inside and search for the switch from there. `
`Unwilling to take even a single step into the room, `
`...I timidly stuck just my arm into the darkness and felt along the wall... `
`"......There..." `
`*click* `
`The switch, which was hardly ever used, felt stiff and lifeless. `
`However, once the light turned on, the darkness vanished in an instant. `
`And there, `
`...exactly as it had been, `
`...as though not a thing had changed in all these years, `
`was the VIP room. `
`...The curtain and bed cover might have been slightly different, and maybe the chairs and the like had changed too. `
`Still, ...if I had to put it in words, I'd call it the feel. `
`...The stiff, lifeless feel of this room hadn't changed. `
`If I hang around here, someone might find me. `
`...I'd rather not have Mom find me here. `
`I readied myself, `
`...and though I couldn't even bring myself to enter this room when the lights were out, `
`...I finally entered. `
`As soon as I closed the door, I felt an oppressive, suffocating sensation. `
`All right, ...I've shut myself up in the VIP room. `
`Bring it, {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`"...What time is it now...?" `
`I looked around the room, but I couldn't see any clock. `
`I'm not in the habit of wearing a watch around the house. `
`...Damn. `
`Now I'm not sure what time it is. `
`Still, I know there's only a few minutes left at most. `
`I tried to suppress my desire to use "going to get a clock" as an excuse to run away from this place... `
`...Even so, just standing around like this was boring. `
`When I looked around again, searching for something to sit on, ...I found something strange. `
`"......What's this?" `
`It had been placed on the side table next to the bed. `
`...If this room had been used often, I'd have thought it was just one of the owner's personal belongings. `
`But no one lived in this room. `
`So, ...this can't belong to the room's owner. `
`"...What is this, an offering or something? `
`...Creepy..." `
`It really did look like an offering. `
`A small French doll was sitting on the side table. `
`The doll's hair...was gold. `
`...It was wearing a black dress. `
`Just who managed to find this doll, and where? `
`There's no doubt that someone placed the doll here to symbolize {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`Does that mean...this doll is supposed to be the owner of this room, or something...? `
`And, looking like an offering to that owner, `
`...there sat a small plate with several cookies and wrapped chocolates. `
`It was all set out neatly, and there was no dust piled up on the doll. `
`...In other words, both the doll and the offering were taken care of on a regular basis by the servants, `
`kept in good condition along with the rest of the room. `
`Taken care of? `
`...No, it's more than that. `
`It looked like an offering...no, like some sort of worship, `
`a prayer saying "please don't curse us"... `
`...So, even though the doll was more than eerie enough by itself, `
`...viscerally, it was even more unnerving to imagine it being been kept safe and worshiped in a place like this. `
`"Stupid. `
`...Am I supposed to clap my hands together and say "please don't curse me"?" `
`Jessica forced herself to look away from the bizarre doll. `
`...She couldn't bring herself to sit on a bed that wasn't hers. `
`Then again, she didn't really feel like sitting down on a chair either. `
`She had lost any desire to sit on anything in this room. `
`I wandered about aimlessly, `
`...then peeked out the window through the gaps in the curtains to stare at the dark, rainy night. `
`...What the hell am I doing? `
`Hanging about in the VIP room this late just because that fight with Maria is still eating at me... `
`This is totally pointless... `
`{f:5:Beatrice}. `
`Just when did that strange witch start living in this mansion...? `
`...Grandfather's always yelling about {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`Since it's apparently the name of his dead mistress, people started talking about how her ghost must haunt this mansion. `
`There's that kids' horror story about the witch in the forest, `
`which might be a ghost story made by the adults to stop the kids from going in there. `
`The portrait Grandfather had hung in April was really striking. `
`And there was also that weird epitaph. `
`...The creepy words on that, which sounded like some sort of ceremony with human sacrifices, made the name of {f:5:Beatrice} seem all the more unnerving. `
`At some point, those stories mixed together, and now people say that the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, exists. `
`...I don't believe in {f:5:Beatrice}... `
`because I know she's just a fictional person made by the fusion of a few horror stories. `
`The Beatrice who was Grandfather's mistress probably did exist. `
`But she wasn't a witch. `
`The story of the witch of the forest was made up by the adults to prevent their kids from getting lost in the woods. `
`But that was just a made-up story, not reality. `
`In fact, I've heard that the adults here once scared the kids with stories about wolves living in the forest. `
`Apparently, the kids realized that wolves couldn't possibly be there, so it was changed to the witch. `
`When the portrait was hung, `
`that once-vague character suddenly had a face, `
`and people acted as though she'd been around since long ago. `
`...That's right, it's all a ghost story someone made, a fiction. `
`And Maria calls {f:5:Beatrice} her best friend, and the servants worship her like a household shrine. `
`I just don't get it, and it creeps me out... `
`".........! ........." `
`The sudden ring of the phone made me jump so hard I thought my heart would explode. `
`There was a phone on the bedside table across from the one with the doll, `
`and it was ringing noisily. `
`However, I was only surprised by the first ring. `
`By the time it had rung three times, I'd regained my cool enough to grumble about this being a prank done by someone trying to scare me. `
`...If I rush to pick it up, I'll probably hear someone laughing at me, saying "were you scared?" `
`I thought about ignoring it instead, ...but it kept on ringing incessantly. `
`It was a pretty loud sound to have going on and on this late at night. `
`If Mom somehow manages to hear it from her room, I'm screwed. `
`"...Okay, okay, I've got it, I've got it. `
`Might as well say "ya scared me" or whatever..." `
`I decided to pick up the receiver. `
`I'll just say "that surprised me, wahahaha", `
`and maybe follow that up with "looks like {f:5:Beatrice} didn't show up after all".`	
`After all, this is my victory, in a sense. `
`"......Hello?" `
`"Uu-! `
`Hi, {f:5:Beatrice}...!" `
`"Huh? `
`...M-Maria...?!" `
`I don't get it. `
`Did I hear that wrong...? `
`Why would Maria be calling here...?! `
`"H-Hello...?!" `
`"Thanks for teaching me that fun song last time. `
`In return, I'm gonna sing you a song, {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`I just learned this one! `
`Uu-!" `
`The voice, the intonation, the manner of speech...all of it clearly belonged to Maria. `
`But...what's she talking about, all by herself...? `
`Maria just kept on talking happily as I stood there, stunned and unable to interrupt. `
`Eventually, Maria started singing an old, familiar kids' song that even I knew. `
`I don't...get it. `
`"...Maria? Hello...? `
`Wait a sec, stop singing...! `
`What's going on? `
`I don't get it...! `
`Hello?! `
`Ah-" `
`The voice and the lights...everything disappeared. `
`In the pitch-black, I couldn't see anything, couldn't tell what was happening. `
`I don't get it, what's going on?! `
`"What... `
`......the hell... `
`...was that...?" `
`Does being in darkness really slow us humans down so much...? `
`I know it's dark, ...but I really have absolutely no idea what just happened. `
`...What was that shuffling sound just now? `
`I-I'm not sure... I can't explain it. `
`I heard an incredible slithering sound, like someone crawling out of a bed. `
`I didn't "think" I'd heard it. `
`It wasn't that vague. `
`I definitely heard it happen, right next to me, clearly. `
`However, there was no change to the bed. `
`No one had been sleeping there in the first place, and the sheets were still perfectly straight. `
`Someone had crawled out of the bed... `
`...and had laughed in a creepy voice before leaving the room... `
`......That's... `
`...what it felt like. `
`Felt like? `
`I'm here, and the bed's right there. `
`I'm not only in the same room, I'm right next to it. `
`...So, why am I so unsure about what happened just a few seconds ago?! `
`I gripped the receiver, which had gone completely silent, `
`...and waited there alone, unable to move, in a quiet room that seemed exactly identical to the one I'd entered... `
`......Huh? `
`...What...? `
`If nothing's changed since the beginning, ...I can just pretend that the last minute or so didn't happen. `
`And yet, `
`...if something has changed, `
`...that would prove that something really did happen... `
`"...The hell? `
`...Where'd... `
`...it go...?" `
`Did it fall to the floor...? `
`No, it's not there. `
`...No matter where I look, from whatever angle, ...it's not there. `
`The offering plate with the cookies and chocolate is still here, `
`...but the thing they were being offered to... `
`The doll is gone. `
`"...No way......" `
`Then, ...what just happened...? `
`Is the {f:5:Beatrice}-sama doll supposed to have cackled out loud and left the room...? `
`No, that crawling sound was too loud to have been made by a doll. `
`It was a noisy sort of sound, like a kid playing with a blanket and using it as a cape. `
`Then, what...? `
`Is that {f:5:Beatrice}-sama doll... `
`supposed to have turned into a human... `
`...and then run cackling from the room...? `
`"No...way......" `
`After that, nothing happened. `
`The doll alone disappeared, ...and nothing else changed. `
`In a VIP room that had remained completely unchanged and was filled only with the sound of wind and rain, `
`...I stood there, too shocked to move... `
`"Did you ever find that doll?" `
`"...I looked everywhere, `
`even under the bed. `
`...But I didn't find it." `
`"Just what did you think had happened in that room?" `
`"I don't think it was actually {f:5:Beatrice}-sama's curse. `
`...It might've been a prank done by the servants." `
`"A prank?" `
`"Maybe they recorded Maria's voice beforehand. `
`They then called at exactly 2:00 and pushed the play button. `
`They could've cut the power at the switchboard or something. `
`...Then, someone who'd been hiding in the VIP room would make a creepy laugh, take the doll, and leave. `
`......If that's how it happened, everything fits." `
`"Doesn't sound like you're really convinced." `
`"No kidding. `
`...After all, if that was just a prank to scare me, the scale was way too large." `
`They made Maria sing beforehand and recorded it. `
`Then, someone called the VIP room and replayed that recording. `
`Then, someone waited until exactly the right time and tripped the breaker for the VIP room. `
`To turn off the power to the VIP room, you'd have to go to the basement. `
`...There's a switchboard booth down in the boiler room. `
`There's no phone line down there, so you'd need a different person to play back Maria's tape. `
`And you'd need another person to hide in the VIP room and cackle before leaving. `
`And...just how long would this last person have to hide in the VIP room beforehand...? `
`How long would they have to hide in the pitch-black VIP room--under the bed, for example-- `
`waiting to scare Jessica, who might or might not even come...? `
`"...There's no way it could be a witch's curse. `
`...But still, `
`to me, it's even creepier to imagine `
`that many people planning everything down to the slightest detail... `
`and waiting for several hours in the darkness just to scare me..." `
`"I agree. `
`A curse would be better. `
`...Did you ask the servants about that later on?" `
`"What's the point? They'd just play dumb, of course. `
`...And there had to have been at least three of them... `
`On that day, Genji-san, Gohda-san, Kumasawa-san, and Shannon stayed the night. `
`So three of those four helped out with that creepy prank? `
`It doesn't make sense...! `
`That's why...I couldn't ask about it." `
`"............" `
`True, it had been a strange experience for her, but it wasn't something completely impossible for humans to do. `
`...Even so, it really must have been more unnerving to imagine a large number of people planning so carefully just to scare Jessica. `
`...It's no surprise that Jessica found this scarier than {f:5:Beatrice}'s curse. `
`"Do you still believe the servants tricked you?" `
`"......No. `
`I was probably scared and mistook what I saw and heard. `
`The doll probably just fell somewhere, and I just had trouble finding it." `
`"Are you trying to say you imagined the whole thing...?" `
`"Other than the doll disappearing, there was no other proof that anything had changed. `
`...Later on, I talked to Maria, and she said she didn't know anything about that song or the phone call. `
`I don't know if she was lying or not, of course. `
`...Anyway, what happened that night... `
`...is just something I thought happened, `
`...and there's no proof of any kind." `
`"That's ironic. `
`Even if you claimed to have met {f:5:Beatrice} directly, you would've been just as unable to prove it." `
`"The shock lasted for a while, ...but as time passed, `
`I began to think that lightning or something must've shut off the power for a second, `
`...and maybe one of the trees in the garden fell, which I mistook for that slithering sound." `
`"And the laugh?" `
`"Maybe some strange bird. `
`...Anyway, I might've misheard something to get that sound... `
`...I act tough, but you wouldn't believe how much of a coward I actually am. `
`That's why I let my imagination get ahold of me. `
`...I tried to use that as an excuse to help me forget everything that happened that night." `
`"And everything is enshrouded in darkness..." `
`"......People are actually pretty good at forgetting things if they try. `
`...After that night, I'd feel uncomfortable every time I heard the word "{f:5:Beatrice}". `
`But I tried hard to not let it show on my face." `
`"............" `
`"......That's all. `
`I can't tell you any more than that." `
`"It's kinda embarrassing, so please don't tell anyone. `
`...I don't want them knowing I'm a chicken." `
`"Sure thing. `
`...I have one last question." `
`"About the VIP room?" `
`"No. `
`About the dining hall." `
`"The dining hall?" `
`"On the day of the family conference, just before your ghost story, all of the relatives were gathered in the dining hall, right?" `
`"Yeah. `
`Except Battler hadn't come back to the family yet. `
`Everyone else was there. `
`...Everyone except Grandfather, of course." `
`"And Ange wasn't in the room because of her stomachache. `
`...Her seat was next to yours, wasn't it?" `
`"Yep." `
`"Was that the seat to your right?" `
`"Yeah, the seat to my right. `
`Why does it matter? `
`......? `
`...Hmm? `
`Wait... `
`...That's strange, why to the...?" `
`"That's enough. `
`...Try not to think. You'll just get a headache." `
`"What's up, Jessica? `
`Why the confused look...?" `
`"...Well, uh... `
`...right... `
`...left... `
`......???" `
`"Hahah, you're so weird. `
`How's it going, Will? `
`Have George nii-san and Jessica told you anything useful?" `
`"A bit. `
`That ghost story about {f:5:Beatrice} was pretty fun." `
`"A ghost story? `
`What kind of story?" `
`"The one about {f:5:Beatrice}'s ghost appearing in the VIP room at 2:00 in the morning. `
`It was pretty creepy." `
`"I've never heard of that. `
`...I don't know who put that out there, but that'd be really rude, making up ghost stories about the woman our Head is indebted to." `
`"A model answer. `
`............" `
`".........? `
`What?" `
`"Do you know about the epitaph, Lion?" `
`"Epitaph? `
`What epitaph?" `
`"That epitaph by {f:5:Beatrice}'s portrait." `
`"...My apologies, `
`but I have no idea what you mean." `
`""Behold the sweetfish river running through my beloved hometown"." `
`"...What on earth... `
`are you talking about?" `
`"So, in your world...no, in this world, `
`the portrait exists, but not the epitaph." `
`"Of course, I know about the large portrait of Beatrice hanging in the entrance hall. `
`...But I haven't heard of this epitaph. `
`What is it?" `
`"...... `
`...That's a very interesting difference. `
`......You've lived on Rokkenjima all your life, right?" `
`"Of course. `
`What's your point?" `
`"When you were a little kid, you were told not to go near the woods. Threatened about it." `
`"Yes. `
`They always said to stay away, since it would be dangerous if we got lost." `
`"Because a witch lives in the forest?" `
`"A witch? `
`What witch?" `
`"The Golden Witch, ruler of Rokkenjima's night. `
`{f:5:Beatrice}." `
`"...Beatrice is a woman to whom Grandfather owes a great debt. `
`Don't you think it's a bit rude to treat her like a witch or a ghost?" `
`"......You don't know about the witch {f:5:Beatrice}?" `
`"I know about the Beatrice who came here in a submarine along with the gold, and about her daughter, who was raised in the hidden mansion. `
`We just learned about those two together a short while ago, right? `
`Where does the witch come in?" `
`"...... `
`I see, so that's it. `
`...Then how did they scare you...to keep you from going into the woods?" `
`"They said that wolves lived in the forest." `
`"...Wolves, `
`...but not a witch. `
`...I see. `
`That's interesting." `
`"Not to me. `
`What are you talking about? `
`What is this witch?" `
`"I'm just talking to myself. `
`I have one more question." `
`"Please, go ahead." `
`"During the family conference, who sits to your right at the dining table?" `
`"My little sister, Jessica, sits across from me. `
`The next in rank is Aunt Eva's son. `
`So, George nii-san is the one on my right... What's your point?" `
`"I get it. `
`...It's all mashed together in a confusing mess. `
`But it is interesting." `
`"Well, I'm still in the dark here." `
