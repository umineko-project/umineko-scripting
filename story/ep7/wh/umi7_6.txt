`"...I think... `
`I've learned just how much the woman called Beatrice influenced Grandfather's life." `
`"We haven't learned anything. `
`"Who killed {f:5:Beatrice}?" `
`Unless we figure that out, we'll never be able to get out of here." `
`"...You're right. `
`We need to finish this quickly. `
`The funeral is already over, after all." `
`"...... `
`You've got it all wrong. `
`...This is `
`the funeral." `
`"You mean, what she's making us do...?" `
`"All of the Beatrices we've heard about so far weren't killed at all. `
`...We're trying to understand where the word "killed" factors in. `
`That's the real funeral, as far as {f:5:Bernkastel}'s concerned." `
`"......No one knows about her being "killed". `
`And that's the truth we're trying to expose?" `
`"You're...pretty sharp, aren't you? `
`It hardly feels like I'm talking to a piece from the lower plane. `
`So, this is why I was given you as my Watson. `
`......Ouch!" `
`"Don't call your partner a piece. `
`...So, what next, `
`Willard Holmes?" `
`"Step one of holding an investigation is questioning witnesses, of course. `
`There's still a {f:5:Beatrice} we need to ask about." `
`To indicate whom they should talk to next, Will nodded in the direction of George, Jessica, and Maria. `
`Maria seemed to be lecturing the others about something. `
`"Wow. `
`{f:5:Beatrice} sounds pretty incredible." `
`"Yeah! `
`And then, inside an upside-down cup, `
`she made tons of candies appear out of nowhere!" `
`"Inside the overturned cup? `
`Amazing. `
`Sounds like magic to me." `
`"...Maria-chan really does love witches and magic." `
`"We could hardly avoid consulting our local authority on witches." `
`When looking for someone to ask about {f:5:Beatrice}, Maria rose to the top of the list. `
`The {f:5:Beatrice} she spoke of wasn't the real Beatrice, the one Kinzo and the others had talked about. `
`However, here and now, on the Rokkenjima of 1986, the name {f:5:Beatrice} probably refers to the person Maria's always talking about. `
`"...I don't see Battler anywhere." `
`Ushiromiya Battler. `
`...The one who was forced to fight as {f:5:Beatrice}'s opponent in many games, and the most important person in this game, ...this tale. `
`A Battler in this world would probably be the piece version, but even so, it should be possible to get some vital information out of him. `
`...Will probably wanted to talk with Battler too, but he was nowhere to be seen in the cousins' group. `
`"Battler-kun did not attend this funeral. `
`It's a shame, seeing as he's the cousin closest in age to me." `
`"Are you two on good terms?" `
`"Yes, of course." `
`"...And you pinch his butt every time he says something perverted." `
`"Oh, how did you know? `
`Did your detective instincts tell you that?" `
`"Poor guy." `
`...{f:5:Bernkastel} said that everything we needed was gathered here. `
`Since Battler isn't here, that probably means it's possible to find out everything without asking for his side of the story. `
`Or, maybe she's intentionally hiding the core elements and making us take the long way around, as part of some fickle witch's game. `
`"Since he isn't here, ...that probably means there's no need to hear his story for the time being. `
`...Let's talk to Maria and the others. `
`...I won't say anything perverted, so keep your hands off my ass." `
`"Then why not try choosing your words a bit more carefully?" `
`With a roguish smile, Lion pinched the air, index finger against middle. `
`"Ah, it's our Successor-sama. `
`Are you done babysitting the old geezer? `
`...Gyaah!" `
`At least Lion was impartial. `
`No mercy, even for Jessica. `
`Will felt a bit gratified. `
`"...I see. `
`Since you're the Successor and Krauss's child, ...then Jessica is your little sister." `
`He was so used to Jessica being an only child that, though the scuffle between the two looked perfectly natural, `
`something didn't feel quite right about it. `
`"Jessica, `
`can't you talk a bit more like a little sister's supposed to? `
`And while we're at it, why not try talking more like a girl your age. `
`How many times do I have to tell you to stop calling me Successor-sama?" `
`"Sh-Shut up! `
`I'll live the way I want to! `
`I'd suffocate if I had to act all refined like you, Successor-sama...! `
`Eep?! `
`Ouch! `
`Owowowowow!! `
`Stop it, don't pinch me! `
`This is little sister abuse... `
`pervert... `
`stop it... `
`owow!" `
`"Jessica! `
`Why are you talking like that in front of a guest...?! `
`Do you want Mother to scold you again?!" `
`"...Looks like those two are close, in their own special way." `
`"Well, Lion is an excellent person to be the Successor, without any faults. `
`...I guess I understand how Jessica-chan feels. Lion might be a bit too perfect sometimes." `
`"She gets compared to Lion no matter what she does. `
`And that made her rebel?" `
`"If Jessica-chan had been born an only child, I'm sure she would've become a composed, quiet young lady. `
`...Ahaha, that's an interesting thought." `
`"Don't worry. `
`That wouldn't be enough to change her personality." `
`"George onii-chan, `
`...who is this person?" `
`"This is the first time we've met, right? `
`But you seem to know a lot about our family. `
`I'm George, `
`and this here is Maria. `
`Pleased to meet you." `
`"Call me Will. `
`I'm investigating {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`Please tell me what you know." `
`"{f:5:Beatrice}?! Uu-!! `
`See?! `
`{f:5:Beatrice} exists! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!!" `
`Though Maria had looked hostile towards this unfamiliar man, `
`as soon as she heard the name of the witch she loved pass his lips, her eyes began to sparkle. `
`"Hey, Maria-chan. `
`You've got to greet our guest properly." `
`"Hello! `
`My name is Ushiromiya Maria, uu-! `
`I'm glad to meet someone who knows {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`Handshake, uu-!" `
`"Nn." `
`Maria suddenly stuck out her small hand, and Will reached out for it reflexively. `
`As soon as he did, ...he felt a bright light seeping out from the gap between their hands. `
`The theatergoing power that {f:5:Bernkastel} had given him had affected Maria. `
`"{f:5:Beatrice} is the witch of Rokkenjima...! `
`She plays with me every time I come here! `
`She's my best friend, and a fellow member of Mariage Sorci√®re! Uu-!!" `
`The light grew brighter and brighter... `
`This time, he could feel himself being drawn into Maria's world... `
`I'm Ushiromiya Maria. `
`My Mama is Rosa. `
`My Papa... I don't have a Papa. `
`I think I remember Mama showing me a picture long ago and saying "this is your Papa". `
`It was a picture of a man with a dark suntan, on a beach wearing a swimsuit. `
`...Later on, when I learned what "Papa" meant, `
`I asked Mama to show me that picture again, but she said it didn't exist. `
`But it had to have existed. `
`When I drew a picture of it and showed it to Mama, `
`she got really mad and said it didn't exist, or that, if it did, she had already thrown it away. `
`Ever since then, `
`...she kept saying that I didn't have a Papa. `
`"...Did you know? `
`People say you need a Papa and a Mama to have a baby, but that's a lie." `
`"Virgin birth, is it..." `
`"'Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, `
`and they shall call his name Emmanuel'. `
`...If I was a boy, that might've been my name." `
`"Book of Matthew, chapter 1, verse 20." `
`"No, verse 23. `
`Verse 20 is 'But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, `
`saying, Joseph, thou son of David, `
`fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: `
`for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost'." `
`"...So your father is the Holy Ghost." `
`"Everyone said that everyone has a Papa. `
`They said it was strange to not have a Papa, that I was a weird, pitiful child. `
`But when I asked Mama, she said I didn't have a Papa, that he didn't exist. `
`She got mad and hit me even though all I did was ask. `
`So...I didn't really understand who gave birth to me. `
`...I was...an immature and misplaced creature, not a proper Human. `
`I realized I was a strange, pitiful girl, different from everyone else." `
`"It doesn't matter who your parents are or what other people say. `
`You are who you are." `
`"It must've been hard to teach that to a young, immature kid. `
`My kindergarten teacher might've said that to me when I cried after being bullied. `
`...But even those words of encouragement couldn't fill the blank space... `
`no, the questions. `
`Those words couldn't answer the questions in my mind." `
`"And the Book is what gave you the answers?" `
`"A priest came to see me." `
`It was probably part of some lesson, to enrich the minds of children through an edifying tale. `
`To most of the children, it was just an ordinary fairy tale they might've heard from one of their teachers. `
`...Actually, I think we were just bored because it was too hard to grasp. `
`Then, at the end, the priest said something important. `
`"That God knows everything?" `
`"Yep. `
`So I asked him. `
`...I only have a Mama. `
`I...don't have a Papa. `
`Mama gave birth to me without a Papa. `
`Was that a strange, sad thing? ...I asked." `
`The priest taught me. `
`There's nothing strange about a child having no Papa. `
`After all, Jesus Christ was born of a virgin. `
`And the one who gave birth to him... `
`was the Virgin...Maria...? `
`I was surprised! `
`Maria, the name I was given, had been showing me the answer all along. `
`"I was so shocked, I asked the priest to say it again. `
`...He said that the Virgin Maria gave birth to a baby by herself! `
`So, I asked him if that meant I could give birth to a baby all by myself too." `
`"And how'd he answer that?" `
`"He said the Virgin Maria was with child because of the Holy Ghost. `
`The second part of the Book of Matthew, chapter 1, verse 20. `
`"For that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost". `
`...That surprised me again! `
`What do you think that means?!" `
`"...You interpreted this to mean that `
`Ushiromiya Maria had no Human father. `
`...That your real father was the Holy Ghost." `
`Regardless of the Bible's original meaning, `
`...this young, sad girl, whose lack of a father had caused her to lose her sense of identity, `
`had finally created a way to understand herself. `
`"Once I realized that, I knew why I was different from all the other kids! `
`The ones who made fun of me were all children of Joseph. `
`But I alone was different! `
`I wasn't worse than everyone else...! `
`I was a child of God, a child of the Holy Ghost!! `
`When I got back, I told Mama. `
`I had no Papa. `
`Mama gave birth to me thanks to the power of God." `
`It was probably painful for Rosa when Maria asked about her father. `
`Why did Maria have no Papa, when everyone else had a Papa and a Mama? `
`Every time she was asked this, Rosa flew into a rage and changed the subject. `
`...Then, for some reason and all on her own, Maria had found an answer that satisfied her. `
`She had no Papa. `
`She was the child of Mama and God. `
`It isn't too difficult to imagine that Rosa, after hearing this young girl's explanation, might go along with it as though it were true... `
`"Beato said that the minimum number of people needed to create a world is two. `
`I thought she meant that you need two parents to create a child. `
`...That's when I thought of it. `
`Beato may be a witch, but she's a witch born of a Human. `
`Beato isn't a child of the Holy Ghost." `
`"But I'm different. `
`I was born from Mama alone. `
`I was born of the Holy Ghost! `
`...Beato can't create a universe without me. `
`But `
`"God is always by your side". `
`I can make a universe all by myself, along with the Holy Ghost!" `
`"Beato called me the Witch of Origins. `
`And she also said that eventually, I might become a Creator, who could create anything alone. `
`All by myself, I can create something out of nothing! `
`Beato can take that and extend it into infinity! `
`Ange was the witches' apostle, who would spread the word far and wide!" `
`"And that was Mariage Sorci√®re." `
`"There's a huge difference between one and infinity. `
`That's why Beato is so great. `
`However, compared to the difference between existence and non-existence, one and infinity are nearly the same thing. `
`I am the child destined to become the best witch, ...no... `
`The greatest Creator in the world...!" `
`"Mariage Sorci√®re was the nest to prepare me for that! `
`I am Ushiromiya Maria!! `
`Maria, who stands by God's side!!" `
`...If we liken Maria's sense of identity to a universe, `
`...then this endless stream of words coming from her might be like the Big Bang. `
`She spent so long tormented over how to interpret her lack of a father. `
`...Then, by chance, she saw a line in the Bible that looked like it secretly referred to her, and she finally formed an understanding for herself. `
`The sad girl, who had hated herself for being different from all of her classmates, finally found a meaning for her existence. `
`At that moment, Maria's universe, which had once been nothingness, was born as a clump of ultra-hot, ultra-high pressured energy. `
`...Then, later on, she went to Rokkenjima, met the Endless Witch who called herself {f:5:Beatrice}, `
`...and the clump of energy exploded in a Big Bang, giving birth to their magical compendium. `
`...That was the universe known as Mariage Sorci√®re. `
`"...... `
`...We're jumping about a bit too fast. `
`Let's take things one at a time." `
`"Sure. `
`Where do you want to start?" `
`"After you decided that you were the child of the Holy Ghost, it's easy to imagine that you gradually became more and more interested in the occult. `
`......And then what? `
`Once you reached that state, where did you meet {f:5:Beatrice}, and how did the two of you interact?" `
`"It really did happen all of a sudden, one day. `
`...I wanted to meet the witch called {f:5:Beatrice}, who lived on Rokkenjima. `
`I wanted to meet her as a fellow witch." `
`"At that time, you already knew you were a witch?" `
`"I did. `
`Even then, when it came to the Bible and the occult, I already knew as much as an adult. `
`So, even though I couldn't use magic, I believed that I was a witch. `
`...Kihihi, it's a bit funny, isn't it? `
`That's why I was only a witch apprentice." `
`"When did you meet {f:5:Beatrice}?" `
`"I don't really remember when. `
`But I do remember what it was like. `
`It was really, really sudden." `
`"......Huh?" `
`"So, you are...Ushiromiya Maria, I presume?" `
`It was so very `
`sudden. `
`I was just drinking some milk tea, all alone in the rose garden arbor. `
`Mama said she had to talk about something important with Uncle Krauss, `
`...so she told me to go outside and play. `
`Suddenly, ...she was sitting right there. `
`I didn't know anyone who spoke that way. `
`I quickly realized that she was someone I didn't know at all... `
`"...Who...are you?" `
`"You're the one who wanted us to meet. `
`Here I am, welcoming the witch who came to visit my island, and yet you ask my name? `
`*cackle*cackle*." `
`"...... `
`B... `
`...{f:5:Beatrice}... `
`...?" `
`"Precisely. `
`I am {f:5:Beatrice}." `
`"Yeah, that is pretty sudden." `
`"Yep. Really, really sudden. `
`...There are witches and spirits right next to us all the time. `
`They just choose not to show themselves. `
`And, when they do show themselves, ...it's always sudden, as though they've been there the whole time. `
`...That's what I learned that day." `
`"And then, you and {f:5:Beatrice} became friends?" `
`"Yeah. `
`She stayed and chatted with me the whole time, until Mama was done with her work. `
`We talked about magic...and witches. `
`And about how I was a child of the Holy Ghost." `
`"...And what was your impression of {f:5:Beatrice} then?" `
`"I don't like saying it, `
`but my knowledge, at least, was better than hers back then. `
`At first, I thought she wasn't a very good witch. `
`...Well, that was just my conceit. `
`There are so many different kinds of magical compendiums. `
`Plus, mine was based on self-study. `
`I probably only viewed Beato that way because her magical compendium was different from mine. `
`It wasn't long before I came to regret that and apologized." `
`"Apologized? `
`...Did {f:5:Beatrice} do something to win your respect? `
`......I see. `
`So, she showed you magic." `
`We moved to the beach and talked lots, sitting at a table under an umbrella. `
`"Very interesting. `
`...Maria, `
`I see you have been quite diligent in your studies. `
`At your age, to be capable of teaching a thousand-year-old witch such as myself is truly an accomplishment worthy of admiration. `
`...So, what sort of magic can you use?" `
`"...Magic?" `
`"If you call yourself a witch, you must be able to show me some sort of magic, correct?" `
`I was stunned for a second. `
`Of course, it should have been obvious. `
`I was a child of the Holy Ghost, and since I'd studied so much of the occult, I was also a witch, not a Human. `
`Until that day, I had been so sure of both of those things. `
`So, when I was asked what sort of magic I could use, it left me in a daze... `
`"When one knows of magic and can speak of it, they finally reach the rank of apprentice. `
`...One is only a witch if they can put such knowledge into practice and use magic, correct?" `
`"...So, ...I'm not a witch yet...?" `
`"You have studied well. `
`And, I can sense a very rare talent within you. `
`One day, you may become a witch so great that even I could not compare, `
`...or perhaps even a Creator as you have told me. `
`However, you are still young and immature. `
`...You are...yes. `
`You are an apprentice. `
`A witch apprentice, you might call it." `
`"So, does that mean you can use magic, Beato?" `
`"Of course. `
`I could not call myself a witch otherwise." `
`"Incredible... `
`...Show me! `
`I wanna see your magic!!" `
`Until this day, Maria had never doubted the magic-themed idea that she was the child of the Holy Ghost. `
`...However, no one had ever proven to her that occult phenomena actually existed. `
`Maria could create a universe all by herself. `
`...However, she wanted to share it with a second person, so that she could believe in it even more strongly. `
`"Once, I could have drawn a rainbow in the sky, `
`transformed it into seven colors of candy, and eaten them at my leisure. `
`However, my power has weakened so much that I cannot even preserve my form to my satisfaction." `
`"You told me about that. `
`You can't use your full power because of the shrine." `
`"It will take quite some time before my power returns. `
`At this moment, I cannot turn rainbows to candy. `
`...However, perhaps I can show you a bit of that power with some simpler magic." `
`"I wanna see...! `
`I wanna see your magic...!!" `
`"Very well. `
`However, I must ask for your assistance. `
`As I have already told you, `
`no matter how pure your soul might be, all Humans are tainted and filled with the toxin that resists magic." `
`"Yeah, I remember. `
`You told me about the anti-magic toxin. `
`It wasn't in any of the books I've read. `
`You must really be incredible to know so much." `
`{f:5:Beatrice} lifted up an empty teacup, `
`then turned it around in front of Maria to show that there weren't any tricks or strings. `
`"Right, the magic to make candy appear inside an overturned cup." `
`"How did you know?! `
`You're incredible, Will! You even know about witch magic!" `
`"...It's...the most basic sort of witch magic, after all." `
`"It was just a normal cup, without any tricks in it. `
`I wanted to see. I wanted to see true magic." `
`There was a thing Maria desired. `
`To strengthen her belief that there was an occult side to her, she wanted to see the occult outside herself as well. `
`That's why she agreed to help {f:5:Beatrice} with her magic. `
`She didn't want her own toxin to ruin her chance of learning the miracles of magic. `
`"Good. `
`...Then try looking inside that cup." `
`"......Ah. `
`...There's candy. `
`...There's candy...!!" `
`"As a gift to mark my meeting with a new witch, and as a sign of our friendship, I offer this to you." `
`This...was a true miracle of magic. `
`For the first time, I felt shame and embarrassment at my conceit. `
`I could feel that sense of omnipotence disappear, `
`the idea that I was the child of the Holy Ghost and the most important and special person in the world. `
`...Instead of a child of the Holy Ghost who can't actually do anything, `
`I'd rather be a witch who can use magic...! `
`Ushiromiya Maria wants to become a witch...!! `
`Starting off as a witch apprentice!! `
`I was already fascinated by Beato. `
`"I want to become a real witch too! `
`I want to be your disciple!!" `
`"How modest. `
`You already have an abundance of talent and diligence. `
`Also, though it may have been different when I was at my full power, I cannot take on a disciple in my current state." `
`"...So I can't become a witch's disciple...?" `
`"Correct. `
`You cannot become my disciple. `
`...However, you can become my friend." `
`"Really...?!" `
`"Indeed. `
`From this point forth, we shall be friends. `
`Let us continue to discuss the deep and profound world of witches." `
`"Uu-!!! `
`Thank you, Beato!! `
`Can I eat this candy?!" `
`"No, let that be a souvenir. `
`Instead of eating it, keep it in that adorable bag of yours." `
`"Okay. `
`I'll eat it at home...!! `
`Uu-, uu-uu-uu-uu-!!" `
`"Maria, `
`that candy was brought into being by magic. `
`Therefore, it is fragile. `
`If you deny my existence with that toxin of yours, it will melt and fade away." `
`"Uu-... `
`No. `
`I don't want Beato's precious magic to disappear." `
`"Then be sure that you do not forget your meeting with me. `
`...As long as you keep a little promise with me, `
`I shall be here to greet you when you return to this island." `
`"Uu-! I'll keep it. `
`What's the promise?!" `
`"Well, to start... `
`When you get home, wash your hands. `
`Then, rinse out your mouth. `
`You must not complain about this, for it is an important part of a witch apprentice's training." `
`"I'll do it! `
`Every day, when I come home, I'll wash my hands! `
`I'll rinse out my mouth! `
`If I do that, will I see you again?!" `
`"I promise it. `
`If you keep your end of the promise, `
`your body will be cleansed, and I will regain even more of my magical power. `
`...If that happens, I will show you even more incredible magic the next time you come." `
`"Uu-! `
`I'll keep my promise! No matter what!! `
`I'll do it! `
`I'll become your friend and a witch apprentice!" `
`"Your resolve is heartening, Ushiromiya Maria. `
`I hope you will grow to become a full witch and my close friend soon." `
`"I think that was the first time I met {f:5:Beatrice}." `
`"And was that candy still there when you got home...?" `
`"Yep. `
`...But I doubted a little, so it was all melty. `
`I regretted almost doubting her. `
`If I'd doubted her more, the candy would've disappeared completely. `
`I almost lost the proof of the magical miracle that had happened before my eyes." `
`"A piece of candy...melted?" `
`"I think it was more of a caramel than a normal candy. `
`It was all lumpy, just starting to melt." `
`"About what time of the year did this happen?" `
`"I'm not too sure. `
`But I remember that the milk tea had ice in it. `
`...Why does that matter?" `
`"Never mind. `
`...Did you tell Rosa about your meeting with {f:5:Beatrice}?" `
`"Yep. `
`I told everyone about it at dinner that day. `
`Uncle Krauss laughed at me. `
`Then, Mama, who was sitting next to me, got mad and told me to stop talking about it. `
`...Uu-." `
`"Next to you...? `
`By your family's ranking system, your seat shouldn't be next to Rosa's." `
`"It wasn't a family conference. `
`It was when just Mama and I came to visit. `
`So, there was only Uncle Krauss's family, Mama, and me. `
`There were fewer people, so we didn't sit in the same spots as a family conference." `
`"...... `
`...And Rosa was sitting in the seat next to you?" `
`"Yeah. `
`...Why does that matter?" `
`"......It doesn't. `
`...Have you ever met with {f:5:Beatrice} outside Rokkenjima?" `
`"No. `
`After all, Beato's body is fragile, so she can't go wherever she wants. `
`I said I wouldn't mind letting her possess me, `
`but she said she couldn't, because she couldn't leave the island." `
`"And after that, you met her every time you came to Rokkenjima." `
`"Yeah. `
`We became really good friends. `
`The more I talked to Beato, the more I realized what an amazing witch she was. `
`She showed me wonderful magic every time I saw her. `
`Then, she told me about a magical compendium that was different from mine, and we both talked together about the mysteries of magic. `
`I wanted to reach her level as soon as I could. `
`I wanted to become the kind of witch Beato was." `
`"Did you ever introduce {f:5:Beatrice} to your mother?" `
`"Nope. `
`She said Mama's toxin was too strong, so they couldn't meet each other yet. `
`...Almost all adults are no good when it comes to the toxin. `
`Because they're all tainted. `
`Kihihihihi." `
`"Was anyone other than you able to see {f:5:Beatrice}?" `
`"They couldn't at first. `
`She said her magical power was weak, so her body would crumble if even a little bit of the toxin reached her. `
`...But she gathered magical power bit by bit, and she could eventually appear in front of other people who had small amounts of toxin." `
`"And who was that?" `
`"Hmmmmmmm... `
`...There weren't many of them. `
`Just a few of the servants." `
`"Specifically?" `
`"All of the servants here today. `
`...Uu-? `
`But not Gohda-san, I think." `
`"So, there were four of them: Genji, Shannon, Kanon, and Kumasawa." `
`"And Doctor Nanjo too." `
`Apparently, they would sometimes come to visit Maria and {f:5:Beatrice}'s witch tea parties. `
`Of course, they had only come by for minor things, like bringing some more tea. `
`However, they were certainly aware of {f:5:Beatrice} and even talked with her. `
`"...How did the servants react to {f:5:Beatrice}? `
`She was a guest who shouldn't have existed. `
`Weren't they surprised?" `
`"Of course not. `
`After all, {f:5:Beatrice} is the other master of the mansion." `
`She said that the servants treated {f:5:Beatrice} as an honored guest. `
`And sometimes, they were permitted to witness new miracles of magic along with Maria. `
`"So, on the Rokkenjima of 1986, the ones who could actually meet with {f:5:Beatrice} were you, Nanjo, and the four servants excluding Gohda, `
`for a total of six?" `
`"Yeah. `
`Beato said she'd need to store up much more magical power before she could appear in front of anyone else." `
`"So, she intended to show herself in front of more people sometime in the future?" `
`"Yep. `
`She said the day she made all of the Humans acknowledge her...would be the day of her resurrection." `
`"............" `
`Maria, the servants, and Nanjo had acknowledged her. `
`She had probably appeared before new Humans one by one, starting with those whose anti-magic toxin was weakest. `
`{f:5:Beatrice}'s game was to increase the number of Humans who could recognize her, `
`until she could make everyone on the island acknowledge her. `
`Of that, there can be no doubt; in that case, the last person {f:5:Beatrice} needed to appear in front of... `
`would be Battler, the one said to have the strongest anti-magical power. `
`...Does this mean {f:5:Beatrice} thought Battler would be the hardest to convince...? `
`It seems true that Battler was one of {f:5:Beatrice}'s goals. `
`...However, if we go with that chessboard thinking Battler loves so much... `
`{f:5:Beatrice} is trying to make people acknowledge her existence, therefore you might say that she's a character who can't exist unless people acknowledge her. `
`Battler reached this idea himself as soon as the first game. `
`Yes, there's something different about the {f:5:Beatrice} of 1986. `
`She's different from the Italian Beatrice or the Kuwadorian Beatrice, both of whom certainly did exist. `
`The {f:5:Beatrice} of 1986, the one we're so familiar with in a mysterious way, yet who has no existence... `
`What does it mean to "kill" this {f:5:Beatrice} who has no existence? `
`...The minimum number of people required to create a universe is two. `
`However, Maria said that even a single person could give birth to a universe. `
`And yet, Maria desired a second person. `
`A second person to nurture the world she had given birth to alone. `
`Because if it was born and not nurtured, it would die and disappear? `
`...Let's replace the word "universe" with "{f:5:Beatrice}". `
`The minimum number of people required to create {f:5:Beatrice} is two. `
`However, even a single person could give birth to her. `
`And yet, that single person desired a second person. `
`A second person to acknowledge the {f:5:Beatrice} created by the first person. `
`That meeting with a second person is the scene Maria has just described. `
`The single person who created {f:5:Beatrice} looked for a second person to acknowledge {f:5:Beatrice}... `
`and selected Maria. `
`We don't need Furudo Erika's heartless reasoning to know that the tea cup magic was a sleight of hand. `
`Maria, believing in the story about the anti-magic toxin, would close her eyes whenever magic happened. `
`Any sleight of hand would be possible while she had her eyes closed. `
`...The caramel Maria had been given as proof of her meeting with a witch had melted a little because Maria had doubted. `
`In a season where one was likely to put ice in their tea, it was only natural for a caramel left in a bag to melt. `
`Ushiromiya Maria, the girl who's too trusting and will accept a story easily... `
`{f:5:Beatrice} appeared first in front of this girl, who had, in the language of witches, `
`very little of the anti-magic toxin... `
`The creation of {f:5:Beatrice} can be thought of as an egg being laid. `
`When a single person creates her, it's little more than a daydream. `
`She's still inside the egg. `
`If and only if a second person acknowledges her, the shell will crack, and she'll appear. `
`She'll only appear if a second person comes to warm the egg. `
`When Maria acknowledged {f:5:Beatrice}, she finally hatched, and the chick was born. `
`In that case, Mariage Sorci√®re, which nurtured {f:5:Beatrice} and her magical compendium, was like a nest. `
`This is {f:5:Beatrice}, a woman with a dignified presence, who calls herself the witch of Rokkenjima and who claims to have lived a thousand years. `
`...That sounds less like the chick Beato, who appeared in the previous game, and more like Beato the Elder. `
`So, did the meeting Maria has just recounted...mark the birth of Beato the Elder? `
`The egg itself had already been created by "the first person". `
`Between then and the meeting with Maria, it matured immensely inside its shell into a "character" with the dignified presence of a thousand years. `
`Then, when Maria acknowledged it, it hatched, `
`...and the witch of Rokkenjima finally gained a form. `
`Perhaps...that moment marks the birth of the {f:5:Beatrice} of 1986. `
`...The younger chick Beato was born out of love for Battler. `
`Since that birth hasn't yet occurred at this point in time, `
`the birth of Beato the Elder and the existence of {f:5:Beatrice} at this moment must have nothing to do with Battler. `
`......... `
`Are you enjoying this reasoning, `
`{f:5:Bernkastel}...? `
`If you are, let's at least have some applause from the spectators. `
`...Great, thanks a bunch. `
`"I wished for Beato to grant me a lot of things with magic. `
`That's why I'm helping with her resurrection." `
`"...What is it you wished for?" `
`"Lots and lots. `
`Kihihihihihi. Not telling." `
`"So, you wanted to protect your Mama from the black witch." `
`"How did you know that? `
`You're incredible. Uu-!" `
`"...And you're already sure that you'll never be able to get that world back `
`without a witch's help?" `
`"Yep. `
`I love Mama. `
`She's so nice. `
`I want to be with her forever. `
`For all eternity." `
`"...... `
`...Now I'd like to hear about Mariage Sorci√®re." `
`"............" `
`"...... `
`...What's wrong?" `
`"Don't wanna." `
`"...Huh?" `
`"I'm thirsty, so I'm gonna go get something to drink. `
`See you later." `
`Maria became suddenly formal, bowed her head, and left without waiting for a reply. `
`...It was a very un-Maria-like thing to do. `
`"............" `
`I see. `
`So, the Game Master has moved the piece. `
`...Apparently, she's telling me to ask about something different. `
`At some point, Lion had started chatting with the other family members. `
`Jessica seemed to be getting irritated at having her butt pinched so much, and George was trying to calm her down. `
`...Jessica and George. `
`Guess I'll hear their stories next. `
`Compared to Maria, the anti-magic toxin is very strong in these two. `
`At least at the beginning of the other games, they didn't acknowledge {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`Maria showed me the point of view of one who believes. `
`Now to hear from those who don't. `
