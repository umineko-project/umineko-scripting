`"Yeah, seriously. `
`Not only was Yasu slow-witted, that kid also lost stuff all the time." `
`"But even so, Yasu always had this look, like someone else had taken whatever it was away. `
`It really pissed me off!" `
`"That kid just didn't know how to concentrate. `
`If you always act in that dreamy way without thinking, it's no surprise that you'll do bad work." `
`"But it was only like that in the beginning, right...? `
`After some time, that kid started concentrating, and all of that bad stuff stopped happening..." `
`"Hmm, really? `
`Well, it was all stuff that anyone should be able to do anyway." `
`"Learning to do things that everyone can do is part of growing up. `
`I doubt the rest of you were so clever about everything when you first started, yes?" `
`"...Are you kidding? `
`If we weren't clever, we'd never have been selected to work for the Ushiromiya family." `
`"We're supposed to be the elite!! `
`The fact that Yasu was young was no excuse." `
`"That's right. `
`...If Yasu is supposed to learn cleverness by growing up, then that should've been done before coming to work for the Ushiromiyas." `
`"Come on... `
`That kid worked really hard to balance school and work... `
`I think you're all being too harsh..." `
`"We were selected because we made it through a harsh process, right? `
`There's no need for us to pamper Yasu." `
`"I'm sick of this. `
`I don't get why someone as dull-witted as Yasu was chosen!" `
`"Being selected as an Ushiromiya family servant was an achievement that all Fukuin children respected. `
`The older servants had achieved glory by making it through the strict selection process. `
`Yasu was so clumsy that they all wondered why that child had been chosen." `
`"...Of course, Yasu was working very hard for a child of that age. `
`However, before long, `
`the unsatisfied older servants started being mean to Yasu whenever they got the chance. `
`Even after getting used to life on Rokkenjima, Yasu didn't manage to make a single friend. `
`At least, not any Human friends..." `
`"Hohohohoho. `
`Yes, that can sometimes happen, and always when you're busy. `
`Perhaps a fairy is pulling pranks on you." `
`"...It's a witch pulling pranks on me. `
`I mean, I knew I'd put it right there, and when I looked away for just a second, ...it had disappeared..." `
`The witch had pranked me again. `
`I left my master key behind, `
`Madam found out, and I got in a lot of trouble. `
`...But I always put my master key in my pocket after I use it... `
`...Why was it in a place like that...? `
`And this is the third time it's happened. `
`The last two times, I realized that it wasn't in my pocket and managed to find it before anyone found out. `
`But the third time, Madam found it. `
`I was really mad and frustrated with that witch in the red dress. `
`"Hohoho, {f:5:Beatrice}-sama's pranks can be quite troublesome. `
`But if you're dealing with a witch, shouldn't a ritual of some sort do the trick?" `
`"A ritual...?" `
`Kumasawa-san started fishing through the kitchen cupboards, saying "now where did that get to". `
`The thing she finally found and brought to me...was a kite string. `
`She stretched it out for me to see, then used a knife to cut off a 50 cm piece. `
`"Try tying this end to the key... `
`Then tie the other end to your pocket button or some other place that doesn't stick out. `
`...This charm represents the ritual of the spiderweb." `
`"A spiderweb? `
`Like the ones the evil spirits of Rokkenjima fear?" `
`"Good, I'm glad you remember. `
`It is said that the spiderwebs on this island are imbued with magical power, and that they can be quite effective at repelling evil. `
`See? If you stretch it out like this, it looks like a spiderweb, doesn't it? `
`Hohoho, this way, that spiderweb-hating {f:5:Beatrice} won't be able to prank you anymore." `
`That...does make sense. `
`It really does look like a spiderweb when pulled tight. `
`......Since Kumasawa-san says so, it must have some pretty strong evil-repelling power. `
`I can just ask her to make several of these kite strings for me, and then I can tie them to everything I don't want to lose. `
`...But, of course, that wouldn't be very practical. `
`I'd have strings all over me. `
`"What about things I can't keep tied to me, `
`...like pencils and erasers?" `
`"Hohoho, for times like that, there's a different ritual. `
`All you have to do is make a house for Mr. Pencil and Mr. Eraser." `
`Make a house...? `
`...You mean, build a roof and a bed and stuff?? `
`"You aren't actually building a house, you're giving them one. `
`...For example, take the knife I cut the string with. `
`"I wanna go hooome!" `
`Heheheh, he's such a lonely kid that he wants to go home the moment he steps outside. `
`So, if you leave him anywhere else, he'll get lost and start crying." `
`"...See, we just left Mr. Knife lying there, so he got lonely and started crying." `
`"...Poor thing. `
`We have to get Mr. Knife home..." `
`"Mr. Knife's house is right here. `
`See, his whole family of knives is waiting for him. `
`"Mama-, I'm hooome." 'Welcome baaack.' See?" `
`Kumasawa-san returned the knife to the knife-holder under the sink. `
`Even though she had done something so ordinary, I felt slightly moved, as though the lost little knife had finished his adventure and finally returned home. `
`Once he slid into the spot he was supposed to be in, `
`all the knives would be together and could have a party... `
`Then, Kumasawa-san said we should give them their privacy, `
`and shut the door... `
`"The poor things hidden by the witch must get lonely easily. `
`So, when the witch tells them she'll take them somewhere fun, they're happy to go along with her. `
`How can you stop them from doing this?" `
`"Take them home right away..." `
`"Exactly. `
`They're lonely, naughty kids, so they'll go with the witch if they get the chance. `
`So, you must always take them home quickly." `
`"...Look at that Mr. Key you just tied to a string. `
`He's sitting there all alone, crying and asking you to put him in his home in your pocket." `
`*sob*sob*... `
`I'm lonely. `
`The voice of the lonely master key finally reached my ears. `
`I hurried to pick it up, `
`took the other end of the string and tied it to my pocket button, and put the key in my pocket. `
`"See, "I'm hooome". `
`Mr. Key gets lonely so easily, so let's take him home right after we use him, okay? `
`If you keep making little friends like this, even {f:5:Beatrice}-sama won't be able to prank you much longer..." `
`*clink*!! `
`When break time was over and I stood up to see what I should help with next, `
`I felt a tug, and the key ring with the master key fell to the floor. `
`...Once again, I had left the master key on the side of the sofa and forgotten it was there. `
`The instant I stood up, the string pulled on it and it fell to the floor. `
`Without Kumasawa-san's spiderweb charm, `
`I would probably have left that master key lying here again. `
`The master key left all alone would have been led away by the witch and disappeared... `
`Whew, that was close... `
`And, once again, I heard the master key, who had almost been left on its own, `
`cry and tell me that it wanted to go home... `
`"...I'm sorry. `
`Come on, let's go back home to my pocket..." `
`Yay, I'm home! `
`Back at last! `
`............ `
`...Thank goodness. `
`...I almost got pranked by the witch again... `
`"Oh, what's this...?! `
`What an amusing notion, using string like that!" `
`All of a sudden, I heard a wild, shocked voice from over my shoulder. `
`It was a voiceless voice. `
`A witch's voice, the kind you can't hear unless you try. `
`"...{f:5:Beatrice}...?" `
`"That's me, my friend. `
`You forgot about your key again, and just when I was about to tease you a bit..." `
`"It's a spiderweb charm that Kumasawa-san showed me. `
`Apparently, it does its job well." `
`"Indeed. `
`I hate to admit it, but it does. `
`I certainly wouldn't want to touch that. `
`After all, you wouldn't want to put your finger on a razor and slide it across, would you?" `
`"...Uwa, ...that's a scary example... `
`My finger hurts just thinking about it..." `
`"But good for you. `
`You didn't have to get yelled at by Natsuhi for losing your key again. `
`*cackle*cackle* You should be thanking me!" `
`"Why?" `
`"Because I annoyed you, you learned of that ritual, correct? `
`Thanks to that, you've managed to avoid the screw-up of forgetting where you'd left your key once again. `
`In other words, it is all thanks to me. `
`Wahahahaha, don't I deserve some gratitude?" `
`"Nng, ...nnnnn..." `
`I really don't like it, but she does have a point. `
`Because of all the trouble {f:5:Beatrice} caused me, I talked to Kumasawa-san and learned the ritual from her. `
`Even without the witch's pranking, `
`...if I didn't have that ritual, I would've gone to my next job and left the master key here. `
`If that happened, ...then surely, I wouldn't have been able to find the key, and it would've been a big mess. `
`"We call this "punishment to make an example". `
`By magnifying your mistakes, I've shown you what they are, as a friend! `
`Don't you see how much you've grown?" `
`"...Nng, nnnn... `
`I get the feeling that Kumasawa-san is the one I should be thanking, not you." `
`"My, my. `
`What a thankless job we witches have. `
`*cackle*." `
`"Anyway, `
`I win this time. `
`Okay, I need to get back to work now." `
`"Very well, my friend. `
`We'll call this your victory." `
`"However, I'm bad at giving up. `
`I'll keep watching you, even more closely now, until I can even the score. `
`Prepare yourself. `
`There are still several small items that a person like you is likely to forget. `
`You can't attach strings to all of them. `
`*cackle*cackle*...!" `
`"The spiderweb ritual isn't the only one I have. `
`...I also learned the "take them home" ritual. `
`I won't let you have your way anymore." `
`"Hmph. `
`Let's see how well you actually do. `
`Even so, `
`that's quite the bright smile you've got there. `
`When a witch appears, it should be time to cry, not laugh. `
`Your break time is over. `
`See if you can manage to do your job today without slowing down the older servants." `
`"Sure. Today is Sunday, and the weather is wonderful. `
`I'd better do my best." `
`"Indeed, go to it with all you can manage. `
`Oh, that's right. Sanon's been in a bad mood all morning. `
`You'd better try and avoid eye contact with her. `
`Also, your fortune for the day is "water hazard". `
`Make sure you take care when standing near buckets of water. `
`...This is you we're talking about. `
`I'll be waiting for you to knock over a bucket and get scolded just like usual." `
`"*giggle* `
`...Thank you, {f:5:Beatrice}." `
`Back when I still couldn't "see" her... `
`I simply hated this prank-loving witch. `
`But now that I could talk with her, ...it felt as though she wasn't all bad. `
`Of course, there was no need for me to be grateful to her. `
`To the witch called {f:5:Beatrice}, who despises boredom, mocking the misfortune of others is like what eating food is to us. `
`Humans and witches are different. `
`Incompatible beings. `
`And yet, ...it felt as though we could become friends. `
`Of course, she's still a witch. `
`I mustn't get careless. `
`And yet, not being careless is a good thing. `
`Thanks to the tricks and rituals I use to keep her at bay, I'm able to concentrate. That could hardly be a bad thing. `
`Those things will be useful for my job and my life, even when I don't have to worry about the witch's pranks. `
`I see, so this witch called {f:5:Beatrice} really is like a demon. `
`Apparently, it's possible to build up a friendship even while speaking hostilely to each other... `
`"Ever since then, there was an incredible change in that kid." `
`"Because of all the rituals?!" `
`"Hohohoho. `
`That's right. `
`That child was quite faithful when it came to obeying rules... `
`and flawlessly followed all of the rituals I taught." `
`"You mean, by attaching strings to everything? `
`And by doing that "going hooome" thing all the time?" `
`"Yes. `
`That kid would sometimes say it out loud. `
`It was really cute, like watching someone play house with a bunch of tools." `
`"Just like a kid!" `
`"But they were a kid, right?" `
`""Ahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!"" `
`"With adults, you can say something one way and all of them will understand. `
`However, there really are many different types of kids, and you need many different ways to teach them things. `
`If you can find just the right way, they learn quite easily." `
`"Some kids learn better when they're punished, and some learn better when they're praised." `
`"I used to scare a neighborhood kid and tell him that a fairy would take his things if he didn't keep good track of them. `
`Hohoho, this was the same, except the fairy became a witch..." `
`"Still, doesn't that sound like fate?!" `
`"After all, you knew this kid was Beatrice's child, didn't you?" `
`"Yes, I did know." `
`"It must have been strange... `
`to tell Beatrice's child that the witch {f:5:Beatrice} would play pranks on you unless you put your stuff away neatly." `
`"Hohohoho... `
`When the child came and told me that a witch was stealing things and pulling pranks, it made me think." `
`"I took it as a sign that the late Beatrice-sama had become a witch... `
`and was coming to teach her child to keep track of things. `
`...That's why I thought this the best way to teach that child." `
`"That kid started out with a bad reputation for forgetting and losing things, `
`but got a lot more cheery after overcoming those bad habits." `
`"By surpassing weaknesses, those weaknesses become strengths, `
`and that is how people gain confidence and grow up. `
`...Those small spurts of growth `
`made me feel as though this was my own grandchild." `
`"""Thank you, Genji-sama.""" `
`"...Good work with the big cleanup today. `
`We never know when an important guest might come and borrow one of the rarely used rooms. `
`It is important that you do not slack off in your cleaning." `
`"Of course. `
`All of us are fully aware of this fact." `
`"...I hope that is the case. `
`When I looked around, I found this. `
`Whose is it?" `
`Genji took a master key ring out of his pocket. `
`...Apparently, someone had dropped their master key. `
`All of the servants swung around to look at me, the usual offender. `
`"Come on. Yasu again?" `
`"Y-You shouldn't be so quick to judge." `
`"I have mine, of course. `
`There's no way I'd drop something that important. `
`And the rest of you?!" `
`"I have mine..." `
`"Got it!" `
`"So, it was you, Yasu! `
`Do you still not get it, even after that scolding Madam gave you?! `
`You're just so...!" `
`"...Normally, `
`I would cower and apologize under their glares, whether I was guilty or not. `
`However, I've changed. `
`So, I proudly held up the key with the string still attached..." `
`"......Hoh. `
`...A device to keep yourself from dropping it? `
`A commendable precaution." `
`Genji-sama's face was as expressionless as ever. `
`However, those were unmistakably words of praise. `
`"*giggle* That's right. `
`You won't drop them anymore. `
`After all, you have your ritual now." `
`...That's right. `
`"I nodded proudly, a huge smile on my face. `
`The proud experience of that day, of that moment, `
`would be engraved into an unforgettable page in the memory of my young life... `
`So, whose key did Genji find...?" `
`"......!" `
`There was only one servant who hadn't raised their key. `
`As she muttered "It has to be Yasu's key, not mine" `
`and fished in her pocket, `
`her face went pale... `
`"You mustn't slack off, even when doing your everyday tasks. `
`But everyone makes mistakes from time to time. `
`I will not press the point, but blaming your teammate instead of reflecting on your own actions is not something I would consider praiseworthy." `
`"M- `
`My... `
`apologies..." `
`The older servant turned red and hung her head. `
`Behind her, ...though no one else could see it, was the witch. `
`"*cackle*! `
`My friend will not make the same mistake again. `
`After all, even though I've always got my eyes on this kid, I can never find a chance to try anything! `
`But it's a shame. `
`If this girl here has lost her key, I should've tried pranking her long ago...!" `
`"Please don't prank people other than me." `
`"Huh? `
`Did you say something?" `
`"N-No, nothing..." `
`"I tried not to feel vindictive, `
`but after being called dull-witted for so long, I was finally able to hold my head up high. `
`On that day, for the first time, I truly felt as though I'd gotten used to life as a servant of the Ushiromiya family..." `
`"When people compliment you, it feels like they've acknowledged you!" `
`"It's very important. `
`People can't grow without it." `
`"And what happens when people grow?" `
`"First, it becomes possible for them to find some leeway. `
`Jobs that used to make them scared, that made them worry about whether they were doing things the right way or not, can then be carried out with confidence." `
`"That's right! `
`Once things become easy, that gives you some latitude!" `
`"And what happens next?" `
`"It gives you a chance to enjoy your time more. `
`As Genji might say it, it gives you time to relax your mind." `
`"If you're tense all the time, that just wears you out! `
`It's good to take it easy for a bit, if you can!" `
`"You mean, you learn so much that you can start slacking off on the job?" `
`"It sounds bad when you put it that way. `
`However, there's nothing wrong with cleverly carrying out your tasks quickly and using your free time to enjoy yourself. `
`Times like that are what enriches a human's life." `
`"Come to think of it, Gohda plays crosswords a lot between jobs!" `
`"He also invents dishes with the leftover ingredients!" `
`"Playing a bit and refreshing yourself can also be good for your efficiency. `
`You might say that inventing dishes combines work and play." `
`"Even Genji slacks off when no one's looking. `
`He'll watch TV or swipe some of his master's drink. `
`And he reads complicated books." `
`""Even Genjiiiiiii?!"" `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`In short, it's all about cleverly using the gaps between jobs to play. `
`If it goes too far, it can turn to laziness. `
`However, people only become mature when they learn to balance work with pleasure. `
`Simply put, if all you care about is work all the time, you're not fully mature." `
`"So, that kid learned how to play between jobs?" `
`"It's hard to imagine that overly serious kid slacking off at work!" `
`"It started with learning how to interact with people. `
`That kid formed a relationship with Kumasawa, the person who was always kind, `
`and started borrowing books from her and talking together about them." `
`"Even I had friends at school, but because of my work, there was no chance to deepen our friendship. `
`Jessica was always kind and modest, but there was Natsuhi's stern order to think of, so we couldn't play together very much." `
`"...So, at that time, Kumasawa, the one who was always as kind as a mother to me, was the person I felt closest to." `
`"Kumasawa was old enough to have grandchildren. `
`They couldn't exactly run around and play together. `
`You developed an interest in Kumasawa's hobby." `
`"And what's Kumasawa's hobby?!" `
`"Books. `
`It might be hard to believe, but Kumasawa was a huge mystery novel fan." `
`"So, the kid wanted to find out what sorts of books they were and started reading them?" `
`"That's right. `
`The nice thing about mystery novels is that you can talk about them while you read them. `
`Even Kumasawa, who already knew the answer, `
`must have enjoyed listening in and hearing what sorts of theories a young intellect could create." `
`"Of course, I didn't start right away with the complicated books Kumasawa read. `
`First, I asked for her recommendations and got books from the school library. `
`I would even bring them into the servant room and read a bit during every break." `
`"Every time a new theory popped into my head, I told Kumasawa about it, `
`and she, who already knew the answer, would nod at my theory and grin. `
`...That was a lot of fun for me." `
`"Are you going to take a bath? `
`Bath time's almost over." `
`"...Yeah, ...just a bit more... `
`Another one of the Indian figures just disappeared..." `
`"*giggle* `
`You've become a total mystery nut. `
`If you get too excited reading, you won't be able to sleep again." `
`"......According to Kumasawa-san, the culprit has already appeared... `
`But I don't have a clue who it is..." `
`"What's that book called?" `
`"It's by Agatha Christie. `
`"And Then There Were None". `
`...It's really interesting. `
`Almost like it's a crime happening on Rokkenjima." `
`"That's a really famous mystery novel, isn't it? `
`Wasn't that one a perfect crime, at least until the culprit confesses to the truth in a message bottle at the end? `
`An incredible book." `
`"Shhh, `
`shhh! `
`I'm enjoying myself, so don't spoil me! `
`Go take a bath now, I'll go by myself later...!" `
`"Okay, okay. `
`...See you later then. `
`Don't forget to take a bath, okay?" `
`Holding a change of clothes, Shannon smiled amusedly as she left the room. `
`I probably won't be able to read the whole thing tonight. `
`Even though I know that, I just keep turning the pages, unable to find a good place to stop. `
`My new joy, the mystery genre. `
`The mental game of thinking and theorizing. `
`And also talking about it with Kumasawa-san. `
`...All of that left me enraptured. `
`"It would seem you've become a complete bookworm. `
`Well, if you do stay up and get sleepy, that just makes my job easier." `
`"We can't have that. `
`I'd better find a place to stop soon." `
`"*cackle* `
`......In the ancient times I was born in, pleasures such as mystery novels didn't exist. `
`I've been reading over your shoulder, and this truly is a captivating read." `
`"Beato, who do you think is the culprit?" `
`"In "And Then There Were None"?" `
`"Yeah. `
`Who is this U. N. Owen, I wonder..." `
`"The culprit who lured the victims to the island, of course." `
`"There are no more than ten people on this island. `
`And U. N. Owen doesn't exist." `
`"Someone must have stranded them on the island and waited somewhere far away for them to die of starvation." `
`"No, that's not right. `
`He or she is on the island. `
`They're one of the ten people. `
`I just don't know who..." `
`"How do you know that there are only ten people on the island?" `
`"...That's just how it is." `
`Since, if you doubt that, you're stuck, or it's just a standard rule of the mystery genre, ...or...hmmm... `
`"The culprit owns the island, correct? `
`They may be hiding in some hidden room. `
`Or perhaps they're like me! `
`They may be a thousand-year-old witch! `
`No, no, if they went to such lengths to kill a mere ten people, they couldn't be a thousand years old. `
`495 years old at best, I'd say. *cackle*cackle*!" `
`"Closed rooms do appear a lot in mystery novels. `
`And books often use the phrase "it could only conceivably have been done with magic". `
`...And here I am, with a witch right before my eyes. It's a complicated feeling." `
`"Pft, *cackle*cackle*! `
`Very entertaining, these closed room murders. `
`...Once you read the answer, it becomes a tale of humans, or a mystery novel. `
`But, if you take out the part that reveals the answer, `
`it becomes a tale of witches, or a fantasy novel." `
`"...Hmmm? `
`That's an interesting way to look at it. `
`So, there's only a tiny difference between human novels and fantasy novels?" `
`"If a trick exists, it becomes a human novel. `
`If there isn't one, it's a witch novel. `
`Simply take out the last few pages of that book you're reading, `
`and you might think of Lady {f:5:U. N. Owen} as a witch on the same level as myself...!" `
`"...That might be surprisingly wise, coming from you. `
`...So, the culprit of an answerless detective novel is a witch." `
`"All of the dark places in this world belong to us witches. `
`So, I could reign as the culprit for all detective novels across the world." `
`"Except, if you reason it out right and find the true answer, then the witch is done for." `
`"*cackle*cackle* `
`These detective novels can be quite intriguing, it seems. `
`This looks to be a truly entertaining thinking game." `
`"That's right. `
`This is a thinking game. `
`You fight against the book, make a theory, and then compete against friends who have also read the book." `
`"Perhaps, but it's also a fight between humans and witches. `
`Will you allow for or deny the magic of my closed room murders? `
`Call it a chess match of mystery!" `
`"...... `
`...So, it isn't a book I'm reading, but a challenge against you?" `
`"Indeed! `
`As Shannon said a short while ago, `
`this story apparently has the truth revealed by a message bottle at the end. `
`So, if you can't expose the truth of the tale before that point, you lose." `
`"After all, the message bottle just happened to drift somewhere that it could be seen. `
`If it got smashed and sank before anyone saw it, this would be a perfect crime, `
`or in other words, a witch's crime that's impossible for humans." `
`"...That's a fun way to look at it. `
`A fight between me and the witch. `
`......Yeah. `
`I really like thinking of it that way." `
`"*cackle*! `
`Starting now, and until you finish reading, `
`I am Lady {f:5:Owen}, the 495-year-old witch! `
`Can you see through my deserted island murder tricks? `
`Ahihhyahahahaha!" `
`"...I do have one theory: `
`you want to play with me, don't you? `
`I've been reading books so much, you've gotten lonely." `
`"That too!" `
`"Pft-" `
`""Hahahahahahahahahahaha..."" `
`...Incidentally. `
`The game Beato and I played around "And Then There Were None" ended with my defeat. `
`In the end, I wasn't able to build a satisfying theory, and I had to learn the truth from the message bottle. `
`Luckily, it did manage to drift into human hands. `
`If it had sunk to the bottom of the ocean, as Beato had suggested, I would've had no way of knowing the truth. `
`In other words, I was forced to acknowledge U. N. Owen as a witch. `
`Mystery. I once thought it was just a genre for novels. `
`To think that it can so easily become a fight between witches and humans, truth and fantasy. `
`I was instantly enraptured by this new "game". `
`As the months passed by, I read through all of the mystery novels in the school library... `
`and started to read mystery novels for adults. `
`I discussed them with Kumasawa. `
`I discussed them with Shannon. `
`I played my game of theory chess, the fight between witches and the truth. `
`Those days...were so much fun... `
`Oh, I am one yet many. `
`Here's to the fun game of the mind that enraptured me... `
