`"I've brought Willard-san." `
`"........." `
`Kinzo and Genji could be seen in the VIP room. `
`Kinzo was sitting back in a chair, his eyes closed as though in a troubled sleep. `
`"...Master, `
`the guest has come to see you." `
`"............Nn." `
`Kinzo slowly opened his eyes.`	
`...Those eyes were red from crying. `
`They regained their focus and slowly fell on Will. `
`"...I am...Ushiromiya Kinzo." `
`"...Will." `
`"I'm Willard. `
`Allow me to express my condolences." `
`"...So, you came here to attend Beatrice's funeral. `
`...Just who are you?" `
`"I'm no one. I have no connections with anyone. `
`Don't think too deeply about it. `
`You'll just get a headache. `
`...Ow." `
`"I ask that you choose your words a little more carefully. (*smile*)" `
`"...Hmph, what a strange guest. `
`So? `
`What business do you have with me?" `
`"I want to ask about Beatrice." `
`"What......?" `
`Kinzo's gaze grew sharp. `
`Lion felt a bit lightheaded and wondered why this guy had to be so direct. `
`"Why do you ask? `
`You're no one, aren't you? `
`Why do you want to know about Beatrice? `
`What is your purpose?" `
`"Because I'm no one, `
`I can listen to your tale impartially and record it. `
`You'll probably leave this world before too long. `
`If you die without telling anyone anything about Beatrice, `
`your children will adorn Beatrice with whatever tale they please, writing that into their memories." `
`"Pft, hahahahahahahahahaha! `
`You entertain me, boy. `
`Do you plan on writing my will for me?!" `
`"But that is none of your business. `
`Beatrice is mine alone. `
`No matter what other people say, `
`no one can defile our tale. What they say is of no consequence! `
`No matter how Krauss and the others misconstrue it, it will be neither painful nor vexing to me." `
`"...Willard-sama, `
`the Master is not fond of wills. `
`He is not one to abandon anything while he still lives." `
`"...Probably true. `
`I thought it sounded a bit unlike you." `
`"The ability to struggle on as long as we have life is what makes us human! `
`You think I would give up so soon and leave behind a will? How laughably absurd!" `
`"Yes, that does sound a bit more like you. `
`...It's not your style to ask someone to write about the past, just because you think your death is drawing near." `
`"...We know how deeply you loved Beatrice-sama. `
`You are the model most worthy of respect that any of us know, and an example for us to follow in every aspect of our lives. `
`Please guide our wandering souls and tell us just how much you loved her, Grandfather. `
`How you were able to live through everything you faced because of her love. `
`...I only ask for you to guide us by showing us that love's strength..." `
`"You're pretty good at this." `
`"It's your fault for being so tactless." `
`"Boy, `
`what do you know of Beatrice? `
`A truly ignorant person wouldn't even be interested in learning more. `
`The mere fact that you know Beatrice's name shows that you are neither ignorant nor unconnected." `
`"Good point. `
`...The Beatrice I know of... `
`is the woman you loved, the one you met before the mansion on Rokkenjima was even built. `
`However, she probably departed from this world, leaving behind a daughter. `
`And that's the girl who was raised in Kuwadorian." `
`"...Oho." `
`"Willard-sama, `
`there is no building known as Kuwadorian on Rokkenjima." `
`"...That name, Kuwadorian... `
`...You mentioned it when we were talking with Aunt Rosa too. `
`...What in the world does it mean?" `
`"You should have an idea by now. `
`It's the name of the hidden mansion deep in the forest where his mistress's daughter lived." `
`"Interesting. `
`...So, you actually know the name of Kuwadorian. `
`...Continue. You have sparked my interest." `
`Kinzo shrugged and grinned... `
`"The one living in Kuwadorian was probably Beatrice's daughter. `
`However, it seems that you, at least, didn't think of her that way." `
`"Oho. `
`...Then how did I think of her?" `
`"When Ushiromiya Rosa went to Kuwadorian, Beatrice told her a little about herself. `
`...In that conversation, she referred to you as Kinzo. `
`It was the same when she spoke to you directly. `
`Though she said that she thought of you as a father, she didn't call you Father. `
`...She either chose not call you that, or she wasn't allowed to call you that. `
`That can only mean one thing." `
`"And what might that be...?" `
`"Reincarnation. `
`You didn't think of your daughter as a child Beatrice left behind. `
`You believed that the dead Beatrice had revived into a new body. `
`...Genji, `
`once in the past, you spoke in front of Natsuhi and several other family members, `
`stating that there had never been a child between Kinzo and Beatrice." `
`"...I have no memory of saying this." `
`Of course, "this game's Genji" probably wouldn't remember that. `
`However, near the end of the first game, when the survivors had all gathered in Kinzo's study... `
`Genji was asked whether Kinzo and Beatrice ever had a child together, `
`and he denied it, saying "I have not heard of anything like that". `
`"That may have been a lie, but in a way, it was a model answer for one of Kinzo's confidants. `
`...After all, in Kinzo's eyes, she wasn't a daughter, `
`but Beatrice reborn."`	
`"Will...! `
`I don't know what you're talking about, but I will not let you slander the Family Head!" `
`"This isn't slander. `
`It's reasoning. `
`...However, I understand the heart. `
`In your eyes, Beatrice was the woman you loved most. `
`She remained that way even after death, for all eternity, and without fading in the slightest. I doubt you thought of her as Beatrice reborn at the moment of her birth." `
`"However, it wouldn't be strange if you slowly began to wonder whether that child, `
`whose blue eyes and beautiful blonde hair reminded you of a younger Beatrice, `
`might actually be Beatrice reborn." `
`"......Master, `
`shall I...?" `
`Shall I drag this rude child out? `
`Genji asked Kinzo. `
`For a while, Kinzo hung his head in silence, as though remembering something from his own past. `
`"Your daughter grew to be beautiful, and nearly identical to her mother. `
`You must've been ecstatic. `
`However, I doubt you'd be completely satisfied by that alone. `
`...After all, though she was Beatrice reborn to you, `
`she didn't think of herself that way." `
`"...How can you know that?" `
`"Whenever she was called Beatrice, she got this feeling she couldn't shake away, a feeling like something was out of place. `
`...People never feel anything out of place about the name they're given at the time of their birth. `
`However, she did have that feeling. `
`That must mean she was aware that the name Beatrice wasn't hers." `
`In Kuwadorian, she asked both Kinzo and Rosa about who she was. `
`'Who am I? `
`...Everyone calls me {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`...And that does indeed seem to be the name of a great witch, as you say. `
`...But that isn't me. `
`I cannot use any magic. `
`...I simply have the soul of that witch sealed inside my body.' `
`"......Her memory... `
`would have returned eventually. `
`...She must truly have been Beatrice reborn. `
`...Her memory was coming back bit by bit. `
`My magical ceremonies were helping her regain her memories one little bit at a time..." `
`"...H-Head-sama..." `
`"There's no need to be surprised. `
`If you line up the information in all the games so far, this is the obvious answer you get. `
`...The high-level {f:5:Beatrice} talked about this. By metaphor, she said that Kinzo refused to let the witch's soul escape even after death, `
`and instead caught it and locked it up in a body of flesh. She also said that her power and memory had been sealed. `
`If you match that interpretation of hers to this theory, it all makes sense." `
`"......Willard-sama, `
`thanks to powerful magical ceremonies, the Master gained a reborn child of the dead Beatrice-sama. `
`That cannot be denied." `
`"I won't deny the stork. `
`And I don't intend to doubt the depths of Kinzo's love for this woman called Beatrice. `
`...How a man shows his affection for a child who's the only living reminder of her mother is no one's business. `
`If she grew to look more and more like Beatrice, and Kinzo's love gave rise to a new, special emotion, `
`I find that a very human reaction." `
`"......You think... `
`you can understand my love...?" `
`"I'm not qualified to understand it. `
`However, I'm also not qualified to deny it." `
`"......Oooh, `
`...Beatrice... `
`...Please, `
`...forgive me..." `
`Kinzo sobbed quietly for a while, wiping away his tears... `
`Because of love, `
`he believed she was Beatrice reborn... `
`and raised her that way. `
`However, somewhere in his heart, `
`...he might have felt ... `
`pangs of conscience, `
`telling him that he might be forcing his emotions on someone who wasn't really Beatrice. `
`Then, the Beatrice of Kuwadorian had an unexpected guest, Rosa. `
`That woman simply couldn't believe that she was the Beatrice Kinzo desired. `
`She couldn't stand the fact that she didn't understand who she was, and she wanted to escape to the outside world. `
`Then, ......she fell from the cliff...and died. `
`"Genji handled that death, which couldn't become public knowledge, very quietly." `
`"............" `
`"Funerals aren't for the dead. `
`...They exist so that those who are alive can sever their ties with the dead. `
`...You could never do that. `
`That's why it festered within you." `
`"...Beatrice... `
`...ooooooooohhhh..." `
`"...G-Grandfather......" `
`"You lost your mistress's daughter... `
`...no, you lost Beatrice twice. `
`Unable to let that sorrow show on the outside, you kept it locked up in your heart, `
`...and it eventually festered and turned to madness. `
`That's what spurred on your abnormally strong interest in the occult in your later years." `
`"Oooooooooohhhh!! `
`Beatriiiiiiiice, Beatriiiiiiice!! `
`Why?!! `
`Why did you leave me twice?! `
`Your smile, `
`that beautiful hair, `
`those eyes... `
`...Why did you die in my arms not once `
`but twice?!" `
`"Is that how much... `
`...how much you... `
`...ooooooohhhh, `
`oooooooooooooooooooooooohhhh...oohhh..." `
`By now, Kinzo wasn't even trying to suppress his sobs. `
`He sometimes scratched at his head in anguish. `
`Sometimes faced the heavens like an opera singer. `
`Kinzo yelled over and over again, repeating Beatrice's name... `
`At that moment, there was a quiet sound of a door closing. `
`...When they turned around, she was already there. `
`Kumasawa had appeared. `
`"......If they already know that much, `
`perhaps we can tell them the rest...?" `
`"...Though, if they know that much, `
`I don't believe there is anything more to tell..." `
`"No, we should tell them. `
`As a woman, `
`...I've always thought that the heart of Kuwadorian's Beatrice is a story that should be told. `
`And now, someone has appeared who is worthy to hear it. `
`I believe that now is the time to tell all, without holding back." `
`"........." `
`"Kumasawa-san, do you know something? `
`About Beatrice...?" `
`"Of course she does. `
`...In the fourth game, we have testimony from the ferryboat captain saying that Kumasawa went in and out of Kuwadorian. `
`I'd be willing to bet that Kumasawa had different work shifts at the mansion and Kuwadorian. `
`There was a young girl to be taken care of. `
`Kumasawa, with her long experience in taking care of children, must have been of immense value." `
`"......That is correct. `
`You might even call me her wet nurse." `
`"No way... `
`...I can't believe it. `
`...So, ...everything Will-san is saying is the truth." `
`"...Yes. `
`It is a fact. `
`...A secret mansion was constructed on the opposite side of the island for Beatrice-sama. `
`Kuwadorian's existence...is truth." `
`"I don't know when Kinzo married his official wife, `
`but at that time, he already had an enormous store of wealth and had bought Rokkenjima whole. `
`He then built two mansions and set up two separate lives." `
`Kinzo's children had also been aware of Kinzo's clandestine eccentricities at the time. `
`It probably hadn't been easy to maintain two separate lives. `
`Moreover, Kinzo's wife had been suspicious and had sniffed around all the time... `
`"The Master stayed in Kuwadorian as much as time allowed. `
`He would sometimes pretend to go on a business trip and stay there for several days, `
`treasuring the time he spent with Beatrice-sama. `
`...It was not a father-daughter relationship. `
`You could sometimes catch a glimpse of his great love for the dead Beatrice-sama, and it was a heart-warming thing." `
`"The way you say it makes it sound like he sometimes treated her `
`as a substitute for the dead Beatrice." `
`"Oho. `
`If it sounded that way, my apologies. `
`...Beatrice-sama probably accepted her father's love. `
`However, I will not deny `
`that she was sometimes forced to bear a love she didn't understand." `
`Kumasawa's tone made it sound as though she was scolding Kinzo. `
`As a mother who had raised many kids, Kumasawa had probably spotted that Kinzo's love was sometimes misplaced. `
`However, the more she grew to look like her mother, `
`the more distorted and twisted Kinzo's heart became... `
`Because of his deep love, `
`it grew very, `
`very... `
`...twisted... `
`"......You are right to scold me, my friend. `
`......I understand. `
`My love is eternal and undying. `
`...However, I must acknowledge... `
`that I poured that affection `
`onto the wrong person..." `
`"...Grandfather... `
`...Wait, ...you don't mean..." `
`"Lion-sama, `
`all humans in this world are tied to each other. `
`Even if they do not notice, there is always some sort of tie. `
`Those ties...wrap themselves around people and bring them together." `
`"No way...... `
`......Grandfather......" `
`Just as Kinzo had done, Lion also wiped away tears and stared down at the floor. `
`Apparently, the truth had been too much of a shock for the young Successor to handle... `
`"...Master, `
`the time to speak has arrived, has it not?" `
`"...... `
`...I see. `
`So, that time has come, ...my friend." `
`"Unless you tell us, `
`none of the truth will become clear." `
`"......Master, `
`...I believe they may have the qualifications and the right to know." `
`"I know. `
`Perhaps on this day of my fickle funeral, Beatrice in heaven has given me a chance to atone... `
`...Forgive me for not telling you this before now." `
`After taking a deep breath, Kinzo finally lowered the hands that had been covering his face... `
`and looked at Will and Lion with those red eyes. `
`"............" `
`"...Grandfather..." `
`"You listen too, Lion. `
`...Guest. `
`Willard, was it?" `
`"Yeah." `
`"...I thank you for giving me a chance to speak of the truth while I am still able. `
`...You must surely be a messenger from heaven sent by Beatrice... `
`...You have my gratitude..." `
`"Beatrice isn't the one you have to thank. `
`It was just a witch. `
`...Well, I guess they're both witches..." `
`"Hmph, ...I do not care who it was. `
`I have been given a chance. `
`That is enough. `
`Thank you, Willard." `
`Kinzo slowly stood up and held out his right hand. `
`He was offering to shake hands. `
`It must have been Kinzo's way of expressing his gratitude... `
`Will responded. `
`Then, the two hands gripped each other tightly in silence. `
`When they did, ...a bright light poured out from the gap between the two hands. `
`"......Nn-" `
`Will felt as though something the size of a grain had burned itself into his palm. `
`...It was the power that {f:5:Bernkastel} had given him. `
`The light grew brighter and brighter. `
`However, it seemed that Kinzo and the others couldn't see it. `
`"...Now, I will speak. `
`I met Beatrice... `
`Beatrice Castiglioni...just before the end of the war. `
`She came from across the sea..." `
`"............" `
`"...Are you...Kinzo?" `
`"It's how Grandfather looked in the past. `
`I've seen photos. `
`...Just what on earth..." `
`"It's the theatergoing power that {f:5:Bernkastel} gave me. `
`...Don't try to understand." `
`"I'll just get a headache?" `
`"You're getting the hang of this." `
`At one time, Genji told Battler that he looked like Kinzo in his youth. `
`Sure enough, though the young Kinzo wasn't exactly the same as Battler, they looked very similar. `
`"...Allow me to introduce myself again. `
`...I am Ushiromiya Kinzo." `
`"Grandfather..." `
`Even the voice seemed to resemble Battler's somehow. `
`Clearly, Battler had inherited Kinzo's blood more thickly than any other... `
`"I had no desire to succeed the Ushiromiya Family Headship. `
`...My being chosen as the Head was nothing more than a prank of fate." `
`"...In the Great Kanto Earthquake, those in charge passed away, and you were selected from the branch families." `
`"That's correct. `
`After all, Grandfather was wise despite his youth, and he already possessed a dignity fitting for the Headship." `
`"Fuhahahahahahahaha... `
`Ridiculous. `
`...Those greedy elders kept looking out for their own personal interests and couldn't decide on a new Head at all. `
`It was as foolish as arguing about who the new captain should be on a sinking ship." `
`"So, since you had no connections with anyone in the main family, you were selected right out of the blue." `
`"It's all because of my toes. `
`If only I'd had one less toe on each foot, my life may have turned out quite differently..." `
`In the Ushiromiya family, polydactyly was seen as a mark of good fortune. `
`After all, many of the great ones in their family history had possessed it. `
`"It was all very pathetic. `
`The elders didn't care whom they dragged in as long as it wouldn't benefit any one of them particularly." `
`"So, they just happened to hear that someone in one of the branch families had six toes, `
`and decided that would do well enough." `
`"Precisely. `
`The elders didn't care what sort of novice became the next Head, `
`as long as they could make him their puppet. `
`In fact, the more this person was ignorant of leadership, the better it would be for them." `
`"...Grandfather..." `
`"Lion, `
`it is quite different in your case. `
`...You will be the one who inherits everything I have. `
`That is the fate you were granted on the day of your birth. `
`That is why I gave you that silver ring and raised you so strictly. `
`...You are quite different from me. `
`You are already a splendid Successor, of whom no one could be ashamed..." `
`"...Y-Yes sir..." `
`"A puppet for a Head... `
`...I doubt that could've been easy." `
`"...Heh, `
`...hehahahahahahahahaha..." `
`As he pondered about where to begin, Kinzo laughed bitterly. `
`It would probably bring back painful memories no matter where he started from... `
`"It...lasted for so long, that span of gray days. `
`That dizzying stretch of time I spent dead, like moss growing on a rock..." `
`I became the rope in the tug of war between the elders, who thought of nothing but their own profit, `
`...and I probably could have snapped at any moment. `
`However, people are far more resilient than one would think. `
`Though I spent so many days as though I had been killed, ...I was not killed. `
`So, I was forced to search for death on my own... `
`Before I realized it, I had reached an age at which the young would laugh at me if I tried to call myself young. `
`That dizzyingly long stretch of gray was left completely empty. `
`It lasted for a full 20 years. `
`In 20 years, a person can be born, find a purpose, and even become their own man with their own place in the world. `
`In short, ...if one truly becomes a human only when they have become a working adult... `
`Then I spent a period of time long enough to create a human... `
`doing nothing but playing the part of those greedy elders' puppet. `
`Ironically, though that time aged my body, it did not age my mind. `
`My mind alone... `
`was still as young as it had been during those rich, happy days before I was summoned to Odawara. `
`And yet, my body alone grew older and older. Eventually, the vast gap between the two reached almost incomprehensible levels. `
`So, I could hardly believe that the worn-out man in the mirror was really me. `
`No, it really wasn't me. `
`The "Head of the Ushiromiya family" was just a name. `
`It had no power. `
`It didn't require that I have any independence. `
`There was no need for me to get involved with anything. `
`I was just a doll sitting there on the doll rack, gathering dust. `
`I remember nothing but lazily flipping through Western books I liked, locking myself up inside my own world, `
`...doing nothing but playing with roses and drinking terrible drinks. `
`And it lasted a full 20 years. `
`Before I knew it... `
`I suddenly had a wife I did not know. `
`...It wasn't any wife I had chosen. `
`It was the daughter of some noble family that the elders had chosen and forced on me for their own reasons, `
`...but that did not matter to me. `
`I did not love my wife, but neither did I dislike her. `
`...I just didn't care. `
`I fathered a few children, but that wasn't out of love for my wife. `
`They were just born before I knew it. `
`...That's all there was to it. `
`None of it mattered. `
`No, that's not quite right. `
`...Everything was decided by someone other than me, and I simply obeyed. `
`That was the job... `
`of the "Ushiromiya Family Head"... `
`"Yes. On some level, I did feel as though I was being slowly and quietly killed." `
`"I can't believe it. `
`To think that you, the one who has been praised for being such a bold and wise ruler, lived life like that for so long..." `
`"...Lion, `
`there is nothing so long and faint as a life you do not live for yourself. `
`And yet, it slides on by in the blink of an eye. `
`...Do not forget this." `
`"A life...you live for yourself..." `
`"Living means having your own will. `
`...You probably were dead during that time." `
`"Precisely. `
`I wanted to live. `
`No, I wanted to die. `
`...How can a puppet die?" `
`"...... `
`...By cutting...the strings." `
`"Correct. `
`That would be death, and it would also be life, `
`...since it would mean being free." `
`Before I realized it, trouble was brewing in the world. `
`World War II. `
`The Pacific War. `
`Japan had extended their war fronts too far to the East and West, and the tide of war was changing. `
`Thanks to the influence of the elders, I was able to avoid conscription. `
`...Of course, this was not out of compassion for me. `
`It was because I was their precious puppet. `
`So, the war never really felt that close to me. `
`However, when I personally decided to abandon their protection, it was very easy. `
`At that time, the Ushiromiya family had almost completely collapsed, `
`and since the elders had apparently gathered enough of the scraps to last them the rest of their lives, `
`they seemed to care little for what I did, now that they no longer had any use for me. `
`So, I realized that I had finally found my time to die. `
`One by one, `
`I cut the threads I was hanging from, `
`...and began to search ... `
`for a place to end my life. `
`"So, you searched for death on the battlefield?" `
`"...I thought that if I was going to die anyway, I should try to be of some use to my country. `
`...No, that's a lie. `
`I probably just lacked the willpower to end my own life. `
`War was a suitable excuse for death." `
`"I heard that Grandfather had knowledge necessary for public works projects and construction, `
`so he was tasked with setting up facilities for the Navy construction team." `
`"Hmph, and what a foolish mistake that was. `
`If only I had just said that I had no useful skills, I could have been sent to the dangerous front lines right away..." `
`"So, you didn't need to go to the front lines?" `
`"Some of the others were overjoyed at their luck. `
`It was the opposite for me. `
`I had only wanted to get drunk on the liquor known as dying for the sake of one's country. `
`...The US planes did nothing but cut across the skies of that forgotten island. `
`...They didn't have even a bullet to spare for me, much less a bomb." `
`"Is this the time you met Beatrice, Grandfather...?" `
`"Correct. `
`She came to me from the sea..." `
`"Where did you meet her? `
`You mentioned an island." `
`"Yes. This island. `
`That's where she arrived." `
`"...So, you met here, on Rokkenjima?" `
`"What's going on...? `
`...I heard that Rokkenjima was uninhabited until you bought it, Grandfather. `
`I never knew there was a Japanese military base here." `
`"Pft, hahahahahahahaha... `
`Ah, yes, you could hardly call that a military base. `
`It was just a cave. `
`I was one of the guards of that cave." `
`1944. `
`Due to the honorable defeats at Saipan and Guam, Japan's Absolute National Defense Zone strategy was in shambles. `
`Where had the gallantry shown at Pearl Harbor gone? `
`The old attackers were now the ones on the defensive. `
`At that time, it was said that the last trump card for the Japanese military was a type of manned torpedo known as the Kaiten. `
`It was said that these ultimate weapons, packed with 1.55 tons of explosives, `
`were capable of sinking any kind of warship with a single blast. `
`To strengthen homeland defense, `
`the Navy drafted a plan to build a string of hidden bases from Hachijo Island to Yokosuka, all to house submarines loaded with Kaiten torpedoes. `
`"I knew that there was a Kaiten base constructed on Hachijo Island, `
`but was there actually one on Rokkenjima too...?" `
`"What fool decided it would be a good idea to plant a base on this desolate island? `
`...To better preserve its secrecy? `
`Hmph, ridiculous. `
`...I could never understand what the higher-ups were thinking, and I didn't particularly want to." `
`The Kaiten, which could finish off a large warship with a single strike, truly was an ultimate weapon. `
`It was hoped that the presence of submarines capable of loading these weapons in the waters just off of Japan would allow for a powerful sea ambush as a final line of defense. `
`So, to aid in the establishment of a base with absolute secrecy, the uninhabited island Rokkenjima was raised as a possible candidate. `
`An investigation of the island resulted in the discovery of a large cave in the cliffs, `
`and this was apparently deemed to be a suitable location for a submarine base. `
`"So, you were tasked with aiding in the establishment of that base?" `
`"Establishment? `
`Certainly, if you can call digging out a cave "establishment". `
`Not only that, the base was abandoned before its completion." `
`"Why?" `
`"Wahahahahaha! `
`Because at that time, Japan no longer had any submarines large enough to transport a Kaiten torpedo. `
`How truly laughable. `
`What's the point in having a submarine base if there aren't any submarines left? `
`If there's one thing that never changes, it's politicians and their meaningless projects." `
`The base on Hachijo Island was outfitted with Kaiten torpedoes and became a base for direct attacks, `
`but Rokkenjima was never supplied with any. `
`Furthermore, the construction was eventually suspended, `
`and a minimum number of men were stationed on the island, waiting for orders from above that never came. `
`Could the fact that it was a hidden base actually have sealed our fate? `
`The higher-ups had already completely forgotten about this useless and pointless cavern. `
`We were nothing more than guards for a mere cave. `
`We spent our days farming, fishing, and playing with the dirt, `
`all the while gazing up at the American formations flying past. `
`...Some of our group were relieved at the prospects of the war ending before anyone remembered we were here... `
`and before any of us had to face a real battle. `
`Of course, it was the opposite for me. `
`I hoped and hoped for the American troops to advance and kill me as soon as possible. `
`Those days were empty and blank. `
`Let us go back. `
