`......When I came to, all was silent. `
`The room was dimly lit. `
`And yet...it was massive. `
`...Where on earth...is this...? `
`I was sitting in what seemed to be a very short sofa. `
`It was very constricting, and looked like there were several more of them off to each side of me... `
`Once I noticed that, I realized that I was in a theater. `
`"...Where on earth...am I...?" `
`I don't know how long I've been here. `
`And, more importantly, I don't know where this is. `
`...Beatrice's funeral ended, `
`everyone went back to the mansion, and... `
`...And after that, my memory gets fuzzy, and I can't recall anything else. `
`Then, I was surprised to notice the presence of another person. `
`Apparently, I wasn't the only one sitting in the audience seating of this vast theater. `
`...The sound had come from a seat to the side of mine. `
`When I looked, I saw a girl sitting several seats off to my left. `
`It was a face I had never seen before. `
`...Who is she? `
`She looked like a high-schooler or a college student, `
`about the same age as I was. `
`"......Nnn..." `
`She groaned. `
`Apparently, she had just woken up... `
`I didn't want to scare her, so I decided to introduce myself first... `
`"...Hello." `
`".........!!" `
`Apparently, she was equally surprised to find someone other than herself here. `
`She jumped when she heard my greeting. `
`"...Who the hell are you?" `
`"I feel the same way. `
`...It seems that neither of us is here of our own accord." `
`"......Is that...the One-Winged Crest...?" `
`"Huh? `
`...Do you recognize this crest?" `
`She looked suspiciously at the One-Winged Crest emblazoned on my collar. `
`Her stare, which was unmoving but not openly hostile, wasn't exactly pleasant for me. `
`"Allow me to introduce myself first. `
`...I am Ushiromiya Lion." `
`"Ushiromiya, ...huh? `
`What?" `
`"Lion. `
`Written as "{p:0:睆御}", but pronounced "Lee-on". `
`...Pretty strange name, don't you think?" `
`"...No stranger than mine. `
`But I'll have to apologize. `
`I don't know who you are." `
`"That's hardly surprising, `
`since I don't know you either." `
`"That's not what I meant. `
`Who are you? `
`There's no one like you in the Ushiromiya family." `
`"And why are you so sure? `
`Do you have something to do with my family?" `
`"I'm a member of the Ushiromiya family." `
`"...But that's..." `
`She showed me her left sleeve...and the crest of the One-Winged Eagle emblazoned upon it. `
`"...I regret having to ask the same question, but who are you? `
`I've never seen you in the Ushiromiya family." `
`"...... `
`...First they tear me into little bits, then they make me read... `
`...What's next? `
`Which witch am I supposed to be entertaining this time?" `
`She spat out those words and seemed to be complaining about something. `
`"Ange. `
`...I'm Ushiromiya Ange. `
`Rudolf and Kyrie's daughter." `
`"What?! `
`...A-Ange-chan...?! `
`But you're supposed to be six years old..." `
`"......I was six during the year of the final family conference on Rokkenjima. `
`...Now I get it. `
`So, you're a person from the year 1986. `
`I'm 18 years old. `
`And I'm from the year 1998." `
`"I-In other words, ...you're the Ange-chan...of 12 years in the future...?" `
`"I'm glad you believe it. `
`But, unfortunately, I don't have a clue who you are. `
`...Who are you? `
`Who are your parents?" `
`"My father is Krauss. `
`Natsuhi is my mother." `
`"That would make you Jessica onee-chan." `
`"Jessica is my little sister." `
`"...... `
`...What's going on? `
`Wasn't Jessica onee-chan an only child...?" `
`By this point, I was starting to figure out the situation this Ange had come from. `
`...She's probably from the world where I awakened as a witch, ...the world where Lion doesn't exist. `
`"It will be a bit difficult to explain, ...but think of it this way. `
`In a world slightly different from the one you know, I am also a member of the Ushiromiya family. `
`In your world, a different fate leads me to walk a different path through life, so that I do not live as an Ushiromiya family member." `
`"......Are you...a witch...?" `
`"Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm just an ordinary human. `
`...What I just told you is something I heard from the witch called Bernkastel-san." `
`"......Bernkastel? `
`That one with the long, blue hair and the gloomy face...?" `
`"...Y-Yes. `
`That probably fits her, I think..." `
`"......In other words, `
`I've been forced to play along with another witch's farce. `
`...Just where is this place?" `
`"I only woke up a second ago myself. `
`...I'm wondering the same thing." `
`"It looks like a theater. `
`...Are we supposed to watch a play or something?" `
`"...I'm really not in the mood now. `
`Let's look for an exit." `
`"......You haven't noticed yet? `
`Look." `
`"Huh? `
`......Ah, these are..." `
`*clank*. `
`I finally noticed. `
`Both of my wrists and ankles had chains attached to them. `
`As long as I sat here, I had enough slack that I could move about a little, but it looked like there wouldn't be nearly enough for me to get out of this place. `
`"...When did...? `
`...Who would do something like this...?" `
`"......Once a witch has made you her piece, `
`you'll be their plaything forever. `
`...There's no way to escape." `
`Ange crossed her legs, making the chains clank together. `
`She realized that no amount of struggling could have broken those chains. `
`...Getting panicky wouldn't accomplish anything. `
`She must've had nerves of steel. `
`"What do you mean, a witch's piece?" `
`"...It's like being their slave. `
`...I made a deal, once. `
`...I said I wanted to see my family, to bring them back from that day. `
`In exchange for making that a possibility, that witch turned me into a witch's piece. `
`......At least the witch kept her promise. `
`I was able to see Onii-chan again." `
`"...You mean Battler-kun...?" `
`"Well, I wasn't even able to tell him who I was. `
`...And, in exchange for that short bit of time, I'm now trapped inside the witches' toy box for all eternity. `
`...Looks like you are too. `
`...Did you make some sort of contract?" `
`"N-Nothing of the sort..." `
`"Did you ever ask a witch to grant a wish for you?" `
`"Never. `
`......She taught me what a miracle my existence is. `
`That's all." `
`"...Either way, neither of us is getting out of here. `
`...Okay, witches! `
`What kind of show do you have for us this time?! `
`Have we moved from reading aloud to theatergoing? `
`Am I supposed to watch someone else read aloud this time, or what?! `
`If that's it, then start it up already. `
`I'm bored enough as it is!" `
`Ange yelled this to the pitch-black stage. `
`Her voice reverberated throughout the theater, but no one gave an answer... `
`...No, someone did. `
`And that was also in a voice that rang out across the theater. `
`However, that voice sounded theatrical, as though someone was announcing the start of a play. `
`"What happened on that day, you ask? `
`I'm not telling. `
`If only you'd just give up and die!" `
`"...Whose voice was that...?" `
`"That old hag. `
`It was Aunt Eva's voice." `
`"What does she mean by "what happened on that day"?" `
`"...She's talking about the 4th and 5th of October in the year 1986. `
`...The day of the final family conference on Rokkenjima." `
`"In other words, ...today." `
`Today is October 4th, 1986. `
`As a prelude to the family conference, Beatrice's funeral was held... `
`"That's a surprise. `
`So, you've come here from October 4th, 1986? `
`Tell me. `
`What happened during those two days...?!" `
`The answer she seeks is inside the cat box. `
`All I can tell her about is my close call with a sad life. `
`However, I doubt that explanation will satisfy her. `
`Then, ...a pillar of bright light pierced the stage. `
`There stood a white shadow. `
`...That white dress was obviously Clair's. `
`Of course, Ange didn't recognize her. `
`She looked suspicious, apparently wondering who in the world this was. `
`However, even I felt as though something was wrong. `
`...Didn't she settle all of her regrets in that funeral a short while ago, before being sent off into the next world...? `
`She stood all alone in the narrow beam of light in the center of the stage, and the expression on her face was lifeless. `
`The light began to grow brighter and brighter. `
`It shone more and more fiercely on her, until it became blinding just to look at her. `
`The world was enveloped by a light so bright that we couldn't open our eyes, `
`surrounded by a sound like wind or television static, `
`...and our minds began to go blank... `
`"Whoo...! `
`They're bloomin' wonderfully again this year!" `
`"It must be a pain to take care of all these. `
`Pretty easy for us though, just looking at 'em." `
`"*giggle* I agree. `
`We've got to thank the people who take care of them for us." `
`"But it is a bit lacking in grace. `
`I prefer the way it used to be, before Nii-san decided to pile so much on." `
`"The old look did have its own charm, didn't it?" `
`"Uu-! `
`I love roses! `
`I'd like them even more if they didn't have thorns! `
`Uu-!" `
`"Whoa! `
`This rose garden really takes me back! `
`I'd totally forgotten about it these past six years...!" `
`"I guess it really has been that long. `
`Both you and this garden have changed so much." `
`"Ah, let me introduce you! `
`This is Kanon-kun, one of our servants! `
`This is the first time you've met Battler, right?" `
`"...Pleased to meet you." `
`"You can just call me Battler! `
`Nice to meet you!" `
`"Shannon's here too, today. `
`Remember when we used to play together?" `
`"Ah, ...Shannon-chan! `
`I'd totally forgotten... That really takes me back! `
`How's she been doing?!" `
`"She's grown more and more beautiful these past six years. `
`You should say hi to her later on." `
`"Shannon and George onii-chan are reeeally good friends! Uu-!" `
`"Maria, shhh! `
`That's a secret!" `
`"If you would, everyone, allow me to guide you to the guesthouse." `
`After enjoying the lovely welcome provided by the roses, the relatives followed Gohda in the direction of the guesthouse... `
`October 4th, 1986. `
`Rokkenjima. `
`In a world without Lion. `
`...On the day of the Ushiromiya family conference. `
`Maria read a mysterious letter aloud after dinner, just as she had been told to. `
`The writer of the letter claimed to be the Golden Witch Beatrice and challenged the family. `
`Try and solve the riddle of the epitaph. `
`Otherwise, I will take everything. `
`It was Beatrice's announcement of the game's start, the same as the usual games. `
`Had an unknown person appeared, related to the problem of the inheritance's distribution? `
`Where was the 20 billion yen worth of gold hidden? `
`What was the purpose of this letter? For what goal had it been written? `
`Who on earth is this Beatrice? `
`It was the usual dinner on October 4th, ...where several bits of suspicion and paranoia intertwined. `
`"George-kun, `
`I'm sorry, but could you go to the guesthouse with the others? `
`My apologies." `
`"...Shannon, `
`take the children to the guesthouse. `
`We will move straight on to the family conference." `
`"Y-Yes. `
`As you wish..." `
`"Beatrice, the Golden Witch... `
`What a fascinating letter you've sent us..." `
`"She's telling us to solve the epitaph...? `
`Ridiculous. `
`That gold belongs to us. `
`Why would we ever give it up to some outsider...?!" `
`"...If we could just find that gold, we'd all be happy. `
`No one would have to lose anything." `
`"Let's go, everyone. `
`They'll be having an adult conversation from here on out..." `
`"...Sheesh. `
`Sounds like it's gonna get complicated." `
`"Come on, Maria... `
`Let's go..." `
`"Beato's ceremony has begun... `
`Kihihihihihihi..." `
`"Okay, everyone, ...I shall guide you to the guesthouse..." `
`"...What's...all this about...?" `
`"Probably a replay of one of the old games, ...or else an entirely new game. `
`In all the games, October 4th happens in pretty much the same way." `
`"...A new game? `
`You mean, a tale that hasn't appeared in any of the Fragments so far?" `
`"There's no way they'd go to the trouble of chaining us down if they just wanted to show us a game we already know. `
`...It's probably a new game. `
`That means there should be a Game Master. `
`...Who is it? `
`...That witch? `
`Bernkastel...?" `
`"I...can't imagine so. `
`...Clair should have vanished already. `
`There should be no need to spin up a new tale..." `
`"Beato's game board was hijacked by those evil witches long ago. `
`Even Beato is nothing more than a piece in their games." `
`"...Just who is behind this, ...and what are they after? `
`What do they want to show us...?" `
`Before this tale began, `
`Clair definitely appeared on the stage. `
`She is the teller of the tale of Beatrice's game. Beatrice, the "me" from a world of a different fate. `
`However, didn't she entrust everything to Will, who solved all of the riddles? `
`There should be no need for her to make new riddles... `
`...In that case, is Bernkastel using this tale to test me...? `
`Along with Will, I have at least touched the deepest depths of this tale...and understood the culprit's heart. `
`So, even if an entirely new tale presents itself, I should be able to see through the riddles. `
`...Is that...what my role is...? `
`Is my role to teach Ange about the truth of this tale...? `
`"...Do you know? `
`...Do you know the truth of this tale?" `
`"I have several theories. `
`Still, none of those can give a conclusive answer. `
`The truth is always inside the cat box. `
`I can't say anything for sure." `
`In this world, Ange is absent on this day. `
`So, it's only natural that she doesn't know what happened. `
`However, at the very least, I do know who the culprit is...and what they were trying to do on this day... `
`"...I think... `
`I've finally understood my role in this." `
`"What do you mean?" `
`"Apparently, you're here as a theatergoer, and I'm here as a commentator." `
`"Then as a commentator, what exactly is it you're going to explain for me?" `
`"After all, ......I know who's behind the crime that's about to occur." `
`"What did you say...?" `
`"Thinking about it straightforwardly, `
`...the only explanation I see is that someone's trying to make us solve the epitaph, hoping to then snatch the gold for themselves." `
`"I agree. `
`If they'd already solved it, they could just take it. `
`There'd be no need to challenge us to solve the riddle." `
`"It's a prank by one of the servants. `
`They must be hoping to pick up the scraps from the celebration if the gold is found." `
`"I cannot imagine that any of our servants would do such a thing..." `
`"...Or, maybe one of us sent the letter, pretending to be a servant." `
`"If that's it, you're the most suspicious one. `
`You schooled Maria-chan on her part and made her read the letter, didn't you?" `
`"I-I wouldn't do that...!" `
`"Give that a rest, Eva. `
`We can't jump to conclusions. `
`Isn't this the time for us all to stick together?" `
`"That's right. `
`The aim of this strange letter is probably to disrupt our unity. `
`The more we let it affect us, the more things will go the way of this "Beatrice" who sent it." `
`"Kyrie-san's right. `
`Wouldn't it be best to simply ignore a letter like that from the start?" `
`"That is what I have been saying this whole time. `
`This sort of prank is not worth considering!" `
`"Yes, that's it exactly. `
`If a couple improbable claims for damages get ya flustered, you'll never be able to sell anythin'!" `
`"My husband's right. `
`This is a child's prank, and taking it seriously is just a waste of time. `
`If someone really wanted to shake up the inheritance issue, they'd come forward boldly instead of using something this roundabout." `
`"You've got it right there. `
`Someone probably wants to make us think there's another person trying to make demands about the inheritance, when their real goal is just to pick up the scraps." `
`"...I wonder if they'll ask for some hush money in exchange for staying out of the inheritance issue." `
`"If that were the case, they should have written it into the letter." `
`"And the letter is just a challenge, telling us to try solving the epitaph or else hand over everything." `
`"The culprit is tryin' to make us solve the epitaph's riddle! `
`Nothin' more, nothin' less." `
`"So, it's simple. `
`If we worry about this letter, we lose." `
`"Indeed, I agree. `
`...After that big mysterious show, like something out of a mystery novel, we've all gotten a bit too wrapped up in this. `
`...Hahahaha. `
`It seems we're all taking this too seriously." `
`"But who did it? `
`...Such an aggravating thing to do." `
`"If it wasn't a servant, then one of us must have written it. `
`I'm not naming names, of course." `
`"St-Stop it. `
`I really know nothing about this...!" `
`"Settle down. `
`Anyway, what this letter says does make a bit of sense. `
`...All of us need money. `
`And, if possible, we need it right away. `
`No one here has any objections to that, right...?" `
`"...Of course not. `
`Whether it's money or love, you can never have too much." `
`"We don't know when Father's inheritance will come to us. `
`...However, the gold of the epitaph is different. `
`If we find it, we could just split it then and there." `
`"In a sense, `
`it's even closer to us now than the inheritance is." `
`"Assuming we can solve the epitaph..." `
`"...Everyone here has tried solving it on their own, yes?" `
`Kyrie asked the room at large, and everyone wordlessly nodded back. `
`"Here, we have four people who have inherited the blood of the one who made that riddle, ...and each has tried solving it on their own. `
`That doesn't sound very efficient, does it?" `
`"...True. `
`We've all been greedy and tried to go it alone. `
`...However, `
`we've already reached a decision about how we'll split the gold up if it's found. `
`And about acknowledging Aniki as the Successor." `
`"Though you demanded quite a lot in exchange." `
`"...I wonder if we can solve that epitaph...if we pool our efforts and work together..." `
`"Two heads are better than one. `
`And here, we have seven." `
`"Today, we reached a general agreement about the inheritance problem. `
`...Why not take a shot at the epitaph for a bit of fun on the side?" `
`"Nice idea. `
`Let's give it a try and call it a break." `
`"...Ridiculous. `
`Of course there's no hidden gold..." `
`"Take it easy. `
`Just think of it as a game. `
`Let's have Gohda-san bring us something cool to drink. `
`We can take a break and all play with riddles as a big, happy bunch of siblings for once." `
`"Hmmm. `
`Well, the night is long. `
`It would at least be more productive than pointless inquiries into Father's health." `
`"I'll ring up Gohda-san. `
`He can bring us something." `
`"Let's have tea and sweets. `
`...Oh, and a map of Taiwan." `
`Two shadows could be seen in the rose garden arbor. `
`...It was George and Shannon's secret meeting. `
`"I want you to take this ring." `
`"...G-George-sama..." `
`"I swear to love you all my life. `
`...Not just now, while we're young. `
`I swear to love you and keep you happy until we get old and go to our graves." `
`"...And are there any lies or exaggerations in your words?" `
`"No, not one. `
`I'm confident in my resolve to love you and build a happy household together with you." `
`"And what would this happy household be like?" `
`"Well, `
`it will be full of happiness. `
`We'll have a house, with a car and a yard. `
`And one dog. `
`The yard will have a vegetable garden. `
`The kids will run around, and we'll smile down on them from the balcony. `
`That's what our typical future Sunday will look like." `
`"That...would be wonderful..." `
`"Whaaaat?!! `
`Those two're going out?!" `
`"Shhh! `
`Why are you so damn loud?! `
`Maria'll wake up...!" `
`"I-I see. `
`So that's how it is... `
`Now that you mention it, they seemed to have a pretty good mood going on there. `
`...That's right, we're about the age where you fall in love." `
`"We've changed a lot in the last six years. `
`George nii-san used to be a bit unreliable, but he isn't anymore." `
`"That's what I thought. `
`George-aniki's got that "air of dignity" thing going." `
`...But still, Shannon-chan and George-aniki. `
`That's a bit unexpected. `
`They played together often enough six years ago, but I didn't think they were that close. `
`"...Well, six years is a long time." `
`"These six years have been huge for all of us." `
`"Yep. `
`...A lot's happened to me these six years, and to be honest, I've forgotten almost everything about Rokkenjima." `
`"And I'd forgotten almost everything about you too." `
`"Now that really hurts, ihihi!" `
`Talking together like this, it felt as though we'd been teleported six years into the past. `
`Six long years, so long that I forgot almost everything. `
`And yet, it's coming back to me, bit by bit. `
`......Shannon-chan. `
`Six years ago, you were part of our group, and we played together a lot, didn't we... `
`Back then, I think I might've...liked Shannon-chan. `
`That was the age when we were all overly self-conscious, in love with love. `
`Bittersweet memories of jokes involving melodramatic, flippant words. `
`"...That takes me back. `
`I think I remember saying all kinds of stuff that I'd be way too embarrassed to say now. `
`Gyaaah, just remembering it is making my face go red!" `
`"Hihihi. `
`Shannon might be a scatterbrain, but her memory's incredible. `
`Guess I'll just have to ask her all about your dark, embarrassing history." `
`"Qu-Quit it. `
`That was six years ago, the statute of limitations has gotta be up...!" `
`...I see. `
`So, Shannon-chan is going out with George-aniki. `
`......... `
`What am I thinking? `
`Could this be...jealousy? `
`I didn't really think about it until now, ...but that thing Shannon-chan and I had back then...was probably my first love. `
`Well, it's not like I have any right to be jealous, after forgetting the whole thing until we met again. `
`"Everyone knows that Dad's hometown was Taishou in Taiwan." `
`"He still chews areca nuts from time to time in memory of that place. `
`Apparently, he got hooked on that instead of smoking when he was young." `
`"...But there must be several rivers there with sweetfish swimming in them." `
`"It has several mountain streams that are famous sweetfish fishing spots. `
`...Anyway, you could probably find sweetfish living anywhere the water was clean. `
`We're completely stuck." `
`"Maybe it was just some nearby creek Father played in as a kid. `
`He said sweetfish, but maybe we're lookin' for somethin' more like carp." `
`"...Or, it could be some sort of metaphor. `
`The river isn't necessarily a river with water flowing through it." `
`"What do you mean by that...?" `
`"Well now... `
`...Who knows?" `
`"Kyrie has a point there. `
`Isn't it a bit too early to be sure that Taiwan is this homeland, or that this sweetfish river is a river with water flowing down it?" `
`"If we look at it that way, we're just stuck again. `
`The more you think about this riddle, the harder it gets." `
`"...That's it. `
`This is just a riddle. `
`...Kyrie-san is right. `
`We need to be flexible in our thinking..." `
`"If we're looking for a river near Taishou, ...that would have to be Danshui River..." `
`"Are you even listening?! `
`We just said that it might not be the kind of river with water flowing down it! `
`Is there any proof that this river is a sweetfish river?!" `
`"Y-You're right... I-I'm sorry..." `
`"...Well, it probably did have sweetfish in it. `
`After all, "danshui" does mean freshwater. `
`Makes sense that a freshwater fish like sweetfish would be swimming in it." `
`"Sweetfish are freshwater fish. `
`So, a sweetfish river would be a freshwater river. `
`...Is that how we get Danshui River? `
`Hahahaha, quite the word game." `
`"Now that's an interesting theory. `
`...Let's advance our reasoning a bit further. `
`As you travel down the river, you will see a village. `
`...What's the name of the town at the mouth of Danshui River?" `
`"......It says "Danshui" here." `
`"I went sightseeing in Danshui. `
`It was a calm and gentle harbor town. `
`Beautiful sunsets." `
`"Did you find "the shore the two will tell you of"?" `
`"...Not really. `
`It doesn't ring any bells." `
`"I guess the beloved hometown wasn't in Taiwan. `
`It might have been Odawara after all." `
`"If we can't discount any possibilities, ...then we won't get anywhere. `
`We can't even get past the first line of the epitaph." `
`"Quiet, you're distracting me! `
`...It has to be Taiwan. `
`Father wouldn't describe any other place as "beloved"!" `
`"...That is one thing we can agree upon. `
`To this very day, Taiwan is the homeland of Father's heart." `
`"It's probably best if we don't spend too much time on the first line. `
`I'm going to take a look at the others. `
`...Just a quick peek, starting at the first twilight." `
`"...Me too. `
`I'll leave the sweetfish river to you, Aneki, and have a go at the second half." `
`"On the first twilight, offer the six chosen by the key as sacrifices... `
`How mysterious." `
`"...I-I've got it." `
`Eva suddenly muttered. `
`All of the others spun around to look at her. `
`Eva was flipping through the pages about Taiwan with incredible force, `
`then found the page she was looking for and slammed the book open so hard that it almost tore. `
`This whole time, the book had been opened to the page with place names. `
`As far as the overall mass of information went, this seemed the most useful page to start from. `
`However, the page Eva opened to was very limited in the scope of its information. `
`It was...a map of railway lines. `
`"...As you travel down the river, ...there's a village, ...a village. `
`......!! `
`There it is, the village!" `
`"...Wh-What are you talking about, Eva? `
`Explain yourself." `
`"Quiet!! `
`There's a shore too, and a mouth...! `
`I'm not sure what it means by "the two", ...but there definitely is a village and a shore and a mouth...!! `
`This has to be it... This is definitely the village where the key to the gold sleeps...!!" `
`"C-Calm down...! `
`Explain it so we can understand too!" `
`"...The Danshui Line? `
`...I see. `
`So, the sweetfish river was actually a railroad called the Danshui Line?" `
`"Well, I doubt there are any sweetfish swimming there..." `
`"Look!! `
`If we follow the Danshui Line down, there's a station that used to be known as Kirigan! `
`Look at the characters it's written in!! `
`There's a village ({p:0:里}), a mouth ({p:0:口}), and a shore ({p:0:岸})!!" `
`"Sh-She's right...! `
`There's a village, mouth, and shore...!!" `
`"......As you travel down the river, you will see a village. `
`...True, that's the only station on the Danshui Line that has the character for village in its name." `
`"I see, it's like a code pointing towards this station's name..." `
`"This has to be it! There's no doubt...!! `
`We just need to look a bit further, and we'll definitely find out what "the two who speak" means...!! `
`...L-Look!! `
`This is it! This is it!" `
`"The region around the station has the same name, except with a mouth in the second character. `
`...That makes a total of two mouths in Kirigan. `
`Are those "the two who speak"?" `
`"...I-Incredible, Nee-san. `
`This has to be it..." `
`"Does this mean that the key is hidden somewhere in this town of Kirigan...?" `
`"I wonder. `
`...The whole riddle so far has been a word game. `
`If so, isn't it likely that the sleeping key is also a word game?" `
`"I agree. `
`On the first twilight, the key selects six sacrifices, right? `
`So, it's hard to imagine that it's actually something key-shaped...!" `
`"...Whoo. `
`...This is getting...damn interesting..." `
`"Offer up the six chosen by the key. `
`...Let's think of a key that's somehow related to this! `
`And let's break down this name, "Kirigan"! `
`I'm absolutely sure that this is a word game! `
`It has to be...!! `
`Think, everyone!!" `
`"That's interesting. `
`...Though this rain would get me down if I were alone, it feels nice and cool when you're by my side." `
`"...It's about time for us to head back. `
`I'm keeping Kanon-kun waiting." `
`"You're right. `
`And I've probably kept Jessica-chan and Battler-kun waiting." `
`"It brings back good memories. `
`Remember when the four of us used to play together? `
`...It was a lot of fun back then too." `
`"To me, it's a lot more fun now. `
`Because I get you all to myself." `
`"*giggle* `
`...Oh, George-sama." `
`They laughed at George's melodramatic line. `
`However, George's laugh seemed just slightly forced. `
`"...George-sama?" `
`"Hmm? `
`...Oh, I'm sorry. `
`......Well, `
`I guess I still have a bit of an inferiority complex when it comes to Battler-kun." `
`"An...inferiority complex?" `
`"Like Uncle Rudolf, he's lively, interesting, and just full of energy. `
`He's much more attractive than I am. `
`...I can tell how much he outshines me when we're together." `
`"That's not true. `
`You're very accomplished and attractive. `
`You aren't worse than Battler-sama in any way." `
`"...Really?" `
`"Yes. `
`Really." `
`"The truth is... `
`...When I first heard that Battler-kun would be coming back this year, ...I wasn't happy about it." `
`"Why not...?" `
`"...Six years ago, `
`...Battler-kun was the one who was really close to you. `
`I wanted to get closer to you, but I just couldn't manage to get between the two of you. `
`...You two just looked so good together that I could do nothing but watch on longingly." `
`"Is that how it was...? `
`Wasn't it just Battler-sama making fun of me one-sidedly..." `
`"...Of course you looked incredibly good together. `
`There's no doubt about that. `
`...I was sure that you two were going out." `
`"That never happened. `
`You're overthinking it..." `
`"......I really am pathetic. `
`I was afraid that when I handed you this ring today, you'd refuse." `
`"Why is that? `
`...Why should I refuse your ring, George-san?" `
`"Because...Battler-kun came back. `
`I was afraid that you might like Battler-kun even now... `
`...and that, now that he's here, you wouldn't have any use for me." `
`"......George-san? `
`Please, look at this. `
`You see this silver glint on my ring finger? `
`What do you think that is?" `
`"...You're right. `
`Sorry. `
`What's got me so shaken, I wonder. `
`...I'm probably still jealous of him, now that he's gotten even cooler these past six years. `
`...How pathetic." `
`"No, it's okay. `
`Those feelings are a sign that your love for me is so strong, you don't want to give me up to anyone. `
`...If you're worried about my feelings switching to Battler-sama, `
`just love me all the stronger so that such a thing would be unthinkable. `
`...Love me so much that I don't have time to think about other men." `
`"I'm scared too. `
`I'm sure you'll meet many women in the future who are much more attractive than me. `
`Or, you might tire of me when I don't match up to your expectations. `
`It scares me to think that I might not be able to grasp hold of your feelings for the rest of my life." `
`"There's no need for you to be scared of that. `
`I swear to love you all my life." `
`"But even though I swore the same thing, you're having trouble believing it just because Battler-sama came back." `
`As Shannon giggled, `
`George finally realized that his own lack of confidence had hurt her... `
`"...I've fallen for a wonderful man named Ushiromiya George-san. `
`And this is a man who has sworn to love me all his life, and who has given me a ring as a sign of this oath. `
`With this ring here on my ring finger, I can give an honest confession." `
`"Sure." `
`"Yes, as you said, `
`...I did like Battler-sama six years ago. `
`I think I probably liked him more than you." `
`"However, `
`that was six years ago. `
`Now, things are different. `
`In these six years, I've sorted out my feelings for Battler-sama, and cut myself off from them along with the memories of the past. `
`Now, I exist only to love you." `
`Shannon spoke clearly and strongly... `
`George gave a single, uncertain laugh. `
`It was probably the same sort of laugh the George of six years ago had made. `
`Then, he stretched resolutely and hugged Shannon without saying a word. `
`In that moment, he said goodbye to the person he had been six years ago... `
`"I've got the ladder...! `
`Here we go!" `
`"<Quadrillion>. `
`...This is the only place you'll find that number written on this island." `
`"One tenth of ten quadrillion... `
`How suspicious." `
`"If our idea is right, there should be some sort of device embedded in that relief." `
`"We just need to check. `
`Who's going up?" `
`"I'll go. `
`Hold that ladder down, okay?" `
`"Be careful. `
`It is fairly high up..." `
`Rudolf climbed up the propped-up ladder. `
`Step by step, as the rain poured down on him... `
`"Look at the "q". `
`See anything? `
`Some sort of device?" `
`"Nnn... `
`Ladder's a bit shaky. `
`...Hmm? `
`Oh boy..." `
`"What is it?! `
`Did something happen?!" `
`"...Heheh... `
`Bingo. `
`Take a look at this." `
`Rudolf tossed the "q" down. `
`It hit Krauss on the shoulder and landed in a puddle. `
`"This is...the key!" `
`"What does it mean?! `
`Rudolf-kun, `
`don't tell me you can take out the other letters too?!" `
`"...Yeah, looks like it. `
`Guess our crazy theories weren't far off after all! `
`What's the next letter to take out?!" `
`"U-Ummm, "i"! `
`And then "l"!" `
`Following her instructions, Rudolf removed the six letters of the first twilight... `
`Now that they'd gotten this far, ...nothing stood in the way of them solving the riddle. `
`By trial and error, ...they finally reached the final stage. `
`"It says to gouge starting from the head, which must mean going from left to right." `
`"Rudolf-san! `
`Starting from the left, turn the keys before taking them out!" `
`"Got it...! `
`Now, we've massacred all of the letters. `
`We reached the ninth twilight, and none are left alive." `
`"So?! `
`Did something happen?" `
`"It felt like something clicked, but nothing changed. `
`Did a hidden door open up somewhere?" `
`"H-Hey! `
`Look at that! `
`It moved, I'm sure it did!!" `
`"......?! `
`Everyone, look! `
`The lion statue's facing the other way...!" `
`"Wh-What is going on? `
`Is there some secret inside the lion statue...?!" `
`"...That's not it. `
`It's probably telling us to look where the lion's pointing. `
`See? `
`Look that way." `
`"That lion's facing a different way too...! `
`What does it mean?!" `
`"It's guiding us, stupid! `
`We have to go in the direction the lions face...!" `
`Eva dashed forward. `
`The others all chased after her. `
`...The gold was right in front of them. `
`"...Now this is a surprise. `
`Who would have thought that a hidden stairway like this existed?" `
`"It makes sense now. `
`Father didn't like people going near the chapel..." `
`"...I wonder how long that device has been there. `
`Judging by the feel of this underground passage, probably for quite a long time..." `
`"I imagine it was built at nearly the same time as the mansion itself. `
`...The riddle of the epitaph was probably also planned many decades ago." `
`"Well, this is Dad we're talking about. `
`...I try not to let the things he does surprise me, but this..." `
`"Just how far does this stairway go...?" `
`"Hey, maybe that old rumor was true. `
`...You know, the story about him having a mistress in a hidden mansion somewhere in the forest." `
`"I see. `
`It's likely that this underground passage goes all the way there." `
`"...I wonder if it connects to the mansion from that day..." `
`"I think we've found the goal. `
`...Look at that filthy door. `
`Something's written on it." `
`"...Whew. `
`Bingo." `
`Something was written on the door in red paint. `
`On the tenth twilight, at journey's end, you shall attain to the power of the Golden Land's treasures, once and for the last time... `
`"Does it open...?" `
`"It does. `
`...Ready? `
`I'm going to open it." `
`"So, we've finally reached the gold..." `
`"We can only hope...that such a sweet deal's really true." `
`"Let's open it, Nee-san." `
`"Right. `
`I'm opening it." `
`The heavy door...opened slowly... `
`Then, the gold-filled underground VIP room showed itself... `
`They only had an instant to admire its splendid furnishings. `
`As soon as the mountain of gold next to the canopy bed came into sight, they all froze, stunned. `
`After a second, the stunned silence faded and was replaced by cries of astonishment and wild joy... `
`"......Incredible!! `
`Haha, hahhahahahahahaha!!" `
`"I-I can't believe it... It's 20 billion yen in gold...!! `
`It really...does exist!!" `
`"What a shining mountain. `
`It almost blinds the eyes..." `
`"Uhhahahahahahahaha!! `
`We did it! We did it!! `
`We win this game!!" `
`"......Y-You mustn't touch it without permission! `
`This is Father's gold!!" `
`"Oh, really?! `
`Then why don't you call Father down here now! `
`Right away!! `
`The time for your farce is over and done with!!" `
`"Natsuhi nee-san, `
`let's put an end to the obvious lies, shall we? `
`We have a real mountain of gold right here! `
`Shouldn't we all be honest with each other?" `
`"Fortunately, we're all in a good mood and feeling very gracious now. `
`Just give it up already!" `
`"Nng...!" `
`A pile of gold this massive carries magical power within it. `
`That power draws out the most honest feelings within people. `
`The light from the chandelier glinted off the golden mountain, lighting them up with its golden sparkle. `
`It was as though the sparkle controlled everyone present. `
`For some time, they forgot their age... `
`and howled and laughed, running about and rolling around like a bunch of excited kindergartners at a park... `
`"...What is all this? `
`What's it supposed to mean?" `
`"Before the crimes, ...the epitaph has been solved, ...and by all of the siblings together..." `
`"That hasn't happened in any of the games before now." `
`"...Supposedly, Beatrice decided not to commit the crime if the epitaph was solved..." `
`"Yeah, supposedly. `
`...Hmph. `
`We'll see about that." `
`Ange snorted, ...but I believed. `
`...This is what Clair decided. `
`Because she entrusted everything to the roulette of fate, she'll obey the result. `
`She let the roulette decide her own fate specifically because "they" couldn't decide on their own. `
`So, she'll do what it says. `
`She'll follow her own rule. `
`She'll definitely keep her promise. `
`"I don't think `
`the crime will occur." `
`"...Are you sure about that?" `
`"Yes. `
`...Her roulette has already made its decision. `
`This is the end of her game." `
`"If it's the end, what happens next? `
`Do they all become happy rich people and leave the family conference unharmed? `
`Does my family get an ingot that isn't chocolate as a parting gift before coming back to me? `
`Will it be a happy end for everyone? `
`You think those witches would chain us to chairs to show us a naive dream like that?!" `
`"......Nnn..." `
`When she showed off the chain on her wrist with a clank, I was unable to counter her with confidence. `
`But I want to believe. `
`Though this might be the least exciting ending, Clair's game has now reached an end. `
`...Perhaps, just once at the end, she wanted to show us a world where no crime occurs. `
`Now that she has disappeared with no regrets, `
`is she leaving us a parting gift in the form of a game where no crime takes place, in a sense, the most peaceful sort of game? `
`I want to believe. `
`...If only these heavy, cold chains weren't holding us in place in this theater. `
`"I-Is someone there?!?!" `
`Rosa's shrill cry brought the celebrating to an immediate stop. `
`Rosa knew she'd seen it. `
`The curtain against the wall had fluttered, and a shadow had been there behind it. `
`"...C'mon, don't do that. `
`You're just imagining things..." `
`"Is someone there?! `
`If you are, come out...!" `
`When Eva yelled, `
`...the curtain shook. `
`And then, ...a witch wearing a black dress appeared from the other side... `
`In an instant, everyone realized that the dress was the same as the one worn by the witch of the portrait, `
`...and they realized one more thing. `
`This person...was the owner of this room. `
`"...Welcome to the room of the gold." `
`Her face and her voice were expressionless, blank. `
`The others all looked at each other, wondering who should respond. `
`Rudolf was the first to speak. `
`"...So, you are Beatrice." `
`"Indeed." `
`"A-And you're the one who gave Maria that letter...?!" `
`"Indeed." `
`"...Is Father behind this?" `
`"No. `
`This is my...game." `
`"If that's so, then we've won. `
`We've solved the epitaph's riddle and found the gold...!" `
`"We've accepted your challenge and won...! `
`That means this gold belongs to us, right?!" `
`"Indeed, it is as you say. `
`...You have solved the epitaph splendidly and discovered the hidden gold. `
`This game ends in your victory. `
`...This gold no longer belongs to me, but to all of you..." `
`"...It seems you're a graceful loser." `
`"Hey, you. `
`...If we hadn't solved the epitaph's riddle, what were you planning to do?" `
`"The letter said that you'd take "everything of the Ushiromiya family"." `
`"Yes. `
`I planned to take all of your wealth...and all of your lives. `
`...I planned to do as I pleased with everything that exists on this island." `
`...The witch walked towards the table next to the bed. `
`Then, for the first time, the others realized what sat on that table. `
`They were...four rifles. `
`There was also a case filled with bullets... `
`The witch picked up one of the lead bullets lying on the table and played with it, her face still expressionless, as she spoke. `
`"If `
`this night ended before you managed to solve the epitaph's riddle, `
`...I planned to follow the epitaph and commit 13 murders." `
`"...Wh-What did you say...?" `
`"...That's what I thought when I first saw that epitaph. `
`...It almost looks like something you'd find in a serial murder mystery novel. `
`...That's right. `
`If you had killed 13 people to match the epitaph, ...that would've made for quite a mysterious crime..." `
`"Th-There's no way you could do that all by yourself...! `
`No matter how many guns you had, killing 13 people...that would just be...!!" `
`"...I formed my plan with great care and constructed several alternatives. `
`I envisioned all of the actions you might take from tonight and through tomorrow... and prepared a mystery to deal with each of those. `
`......I'm afraid I cannot reveal those at this point, but it really was a tightly-knit set of pleasant closed room murders." `
`"If there were just a few of us, you probably could've gunned us down in our sleep. `
`But there's no way you could've killed 13 of us...! `
`We aren't that stupid." `
`"......It would seem so. `
`At any rate, I predicted that the epitaph being solved before the first twilight was the most unlikely result." `
`"It would seem that us reaching this place was a miscalculation on your part." `
`"No. `
`...Even this was one of the results of the roulette I wished to create. `
`This is probably the best outcome for all of you. `
`No one will die, and you can leave this island with the gold. `
`...Congratulations. `
`This game ends with a perfect victory for you all." `
`If no one could solve the riddle, she planned to take a gun and commit a serial murder. `
`Everyone gulped as they watched the witch emotionlessly make her confession... `
`"...If this confession of yours is the truth, `
`that means you were trying to kill us." `
`"Yes. `
`That is true." `
`"The hell... `
`How can you just say it like that?" `
`"You couldn't possibly expect us to treat you favorably after revealing that much to us, right...?" `
`"I am prepared. `
`......You may do as you will with me. `
`...If you hadn't solved the epitaph, I would have done the same to you, so it is only fair." `
`"...This girl's got guts." `
`"I planned this game because I was prepared to bet my life. `
`I am satisfied with the result. `
`...If you wish to kill me now, I am prepared." `
`By now, she didn't even treasure her life. `
`As the witch spoke and walked near the others, they automatically stepped back... `
`"The gold belongs to all of you. `
`I planned to give everything to the one who discovered it first, but I didn't expect there to be seven of you. `
`...I leave the decision of how to split the gold to you. `
`I will not involve myself. `
`...And..." `
`The witch walked even closer. `
`The group parted, and she walked up to the antique clock behind them. `
`The clock was large and had a dignified feel to it. `
`The witch patted it and spoke. `
`"...Allow me to explain the device within this clock. `
`...For you have gained not just the gold, `
`but the entirety of this island." `
`"What...do you mean by that?" `
`"...... `
`If you read it like a murder case up until the eighth twilight, then only 13 people are killed. `
`But by the ninth twilight, `
`...it clearly says that none are to be left alive." `
`"What does that mean? `
`That she...was planning to massacre all of us?" `
`"...Don't tell me, that clock..." `
`"As you have guessed, `
`...it is linked to a set of explosives." `
`"Are you the one who set that up? `
`...Or was that Ushiromiya Kinzo?" `
`"Kinzo is the one who set up the device. `
`It's the source of his mad magical power..." `
`"...I-I don't have a clue what you're talkin' about." `
`"In other words, `
`...Dad set up this bomb, `
`and if he ever went broke, he was prepared to die in a blast that would wipe away everything including himself......?" `
`"On this island, Ushiromiya Kinzo made a contract with the Golden Witch and obtained the gold. `
`However, that was not all he gained." `
`"...Wh-What are you talking about...?" `
`"Wait, ...don't tell me... `
`........." `
`"There is that rumor about the remains of an old Japanese military base existing on Rokkenjima... `
`Could it be..." `
`"Your guess is correct. `
`...Beneath this island sleep the remains of an underground Japanese military base from the time of the war. `
`Along with 900 tons of explosives." `
`"...N-Nine hundred tons?! `
`Th-That's unbelievable! `
`If that exploded, the result would be unimaginable! `
`Forget just the mansion blowin' up, ...it'd leave a massive crater!!" `
`"I believe an expert's estimate put it at a hole several dozen meters deep and a kilometer across." `
`"...There wouldn't be...even a trace left..." `
`"Those explosives can be ignited by a special device. `
`...One connected to the activation switch I just flipped." `
`The witch toyed with a switch on the top part of the antique clock. `
`"...If 24:00 arrives when the switch is in this position, the bombs will explode." `
`"U-Umm, it's almost 24:00 now..." `
`"In other words, it won't explode X hours after you flip it. `
`...It's a time limit bomb that only explodes at midnight. `
`"Indeed. `
`...It is almost 24:00 now. `
`If such an explosion is what you desire, you need only leave it like this." `
`"Who would want that...?!! `
`Turn it off!" `
`By this time, Kinzo was probably the only one who knew. `
`The secret base on Rokkenjima had started out as a submarine base. `
`However, when that plan reached a standstill, it was redefined as a top secret base for homeland defense. `
`A huge plan had been drawn up to have the army and navy perform a pincer attack on American forces if the latter decided to land on Kujuukuri Beach and press towards Tokyo. `
`As a trump card for this massive defensive maneuver, the navy started stockpiling large quantities of explosives and fuel in absolute secrecy. `
`And the Rokkenjima base was the location of that top-secret stockpile. `
`The buried explosives weighed 900 tons in total. `
`Also, fearing that the Americans might find out the island's secrets and seize the explosives, `
`they set up a system for the self-destruction of the entire island... `
`Kinzo, who knew all of this, decided not to remove this device, but to tie it in with this strange clock that could trigger such an explosion any night at midnight. `
`...Kinzo was famous for building up his funds using a vast store of gold, `
`then using those funds in several sink-or-swim gambles, one after another. `
`Just what did his stockpile of gold...and the 900 tons of sleeping explosives mean to him? `
`At this point, we can only guess. `
`Perhaps the true source of Kinzo's mad power...wasn't the gold after all. `
`If he lost a big gamble and all that he owned, he could erase this entire island from existence with this device. `
`For the rest of his life, he must have put the gold and everything else he had on the line... `
`Kinzo probably stared at this clock at times, ...sometimes flipping the activation switch and letting it tick down. `
`Maybe, whenever he came up against a troubling problem, he would hide in here...and flip the switch... `
`...With the intention of blowing everything away if he didn't think of a brilliant plan before 24:00 came. `
`He could gaze at this mountain of gold, listening to the clock tick towards his death as he searched for an idea... `
`Perhaps Ushiromiya Kinzo's real study wasn't the one in the mansion, `
`but this place instead... `
`"...That sort of switch sounds just like Dad. `
`...So, maybe each time Dad worried about something, all of us kids were put on the line as well..." `
`"This is Father, ...so it wouldn't be unthinkable..." `
`"This device now belongs to all of you. `
`...If you desire a massive explosion, use it whenever you please." `
`"A-Are you crazy...?! `
`Who'd want a big explosion...?!!" `
`"...These explosives are half a century old, right? `
`Would they really go off?" `
`"Yes, of course. `
`The explosives and the fuses are still working. `
`...I tested them myself." `
`"You tested them...?" `
`"...You mean...that?" `
`"I see... Now I finally understand. `
`So, that's why the shrine disappeared without a trace..." `
`That summer, the shrine had disappeared completely, along with the reef under it. `
`Though people found it odd that the waves could have wiped it out so completely, no one paid it much mind. `
`And now, this piece fits perfectly into the hole that caused that strange feeling... `
`"Indeed. `
`......I used that shrine to test whether the explosives were still working after half a century. `
`I believe you are all aware of the result." `
`"............" `
`"The little bit I used was enough to make that entire reef vanish. `
`It's easy to see how 900 tons of that would cause an explosion large enough to rewrite the map..." `
`"...If an explosion like that were to occur, it would certainly kill all of us. `
`But what about you? `
`I doubt you were planning to commit a group suicide with us..." `
`"This underground VIP room is connected by a subterranean passage to the remnants of the military base. `
`If you go straight along that, you'll come out at the hidden mansion on the opposite side of the island, Kuwadorian. `
`It's about two kilometers away. `
`If you make it all the way there, you should be able to escape the blast." `
`"...I see. `
`So, you planned to escape to there just before the blast." `
`"I have only said that such a thing is possible. `
`...You may not believe this, but if the ninth twilight ended before any of you could solve the riddle, `
`...I planned to die along with everything else." `
`"...There's something seriously wrong with this girl..." `
`"She's insane... `
`There's no point overthinking it! `
`If we hadn't solved the epitaph, she would've used those guns, `
`or else that switch, `
`to massacre all of us, right?! `
`There's no doubting that now!!" `
`"You are correct. `
`...You have ended this game in the best possible way, without there being even a single victim. `
`...I wish to convey my respect and admiration. `
`There may have been seven of you, but you did solve that riddle, which took me so long to solve, in a single night. `
`...That is worthy of praise." `
`"And I admire you for your graciousness and honesty in defeat. `
`......We'll decide how to deal with you in the future, but I intend to do all I can to reach a gentlemanly agreement." `
`"...Pay me no mind any longer. `
`I am already one of the dead, who was already prepared to kill everyone and die myself." `
`The Golden Witch Beatrice solved the epitaph, reached this room, and revived. `
`And now, `
`...new people had solved the riddle and reached this room, ...so her role was finished. `
`When the epitaph's riddle was solved, ...Beatrice's illusion of the witch ended. `
`Most likely, no one in this room was capable of understanding her grim determination. `
`...She herself was probably the only one who understood. `
`As long as the many selves inside of her understood, that was enough. `
`......I am one yet many. `
`I abandoned myself to the magical roulette of endless possibilities. `
`The result...the answer...is this. `
`This is what the tarot cards known as the epitaph ceremony have shown me. `
`...Beatrice is already dead. `
`They did not kill her. `
`I killed her myself, ...in accordance with fate's command. `
`They will never understand, ...for all eternity. `
`............ `
`The witch stared up at the ceiling without speaking for a while, then looked as though she'd suddenly remembered something. `
`She grabbed at the sleeves of her dress and took out some sort of card. `
`"Oh, yes. `
`I forgot. `
`...I have no need for money after death. `
`I will give this to all of you as well." `
`"...A cash card?" `
`"I have converted a portion of the gold to cash. `
`This is for the account that the money is in." `
`"I see. `
`So this is source of the Golden Witch's magical energy." `
`"How much?" `
`"I've forgotten the details. `
`However, there is more than a billion yen." `
`"A billion...! `
`Now that really would be magic!" `
`"True. `
`There's nothing you couldn't do with that much money." `
`"Very true. `
`The strongest magic to counter the Humans' anti-magic toxin is this magic of gold. `
`...It may be that this card holds greater power than the ingots." `
`"Certainly. `
`Cash would be much more agreeable than ingots." `
`"Here you go. `
`......I have no need of this anymore." `
`The card she held out...was not taken by any of them. `
`Who would ever just hand over a card with a billion yen in it? `
`The mountain of gold, the device for blowing up the island, the card with a billion yen... `
`...All of these surpassed their understanding. `
`So, ...no one could bring themselves to take it. `
`"...I don't like it." `
`"...What don't you like?" `
`"Here you go, here's a mountain of gold. `
`And I'll turn off the explosives and give you a card worth a billion yen while we're at it. `
`...It sounds far too good to be true. `
`...You're trying to trick us somehow, aren't you?" `
`"I have no desire to trick you, but I won't try and force you to believe. `
`...I have offered you everything, revealed everything. `
`What you believe and what you do is now for you, the new masters of the gold, to decide. `
`You are even free to disbelieve all I say and leave this place." `
`"Eva, `
`I can't imagine that she's lying." `
`"And how could you know that?! `
`I don't like how relaxed she's acting! `
`It's as though she thinks she's already won! `
`...I just had an idea, a second ago!! `
`What if she's lying about which is the "off" side of the switch?!" `
`"Wh-What do you mean, Nee-san...?" `
`"Just a second ago, this woman flipped the switch to the side she said would turn off the bomb! `
`But what if that actually armed the bomb?! `
`We solved the riddle, so you turned the bomb's switch to "on", trying to blow us and everything else up, right?!" `
`"...... `
`...If that is what you think, then feel free to flip the switch on this clock. `
`It will be 24:00 in one minute. `
`...The clock will show you the truth." `
`"...Wh-What did you say...?" `
`"H-Hey, what're we supposed to do...? `
`Is the bomb set to "on" now? `
`Or "off"?!" `
`"I can't imagine that she's lying...! `
`It's inactive now. `
`We shouldn't flip it...!" `
`"But I don't like it!! `
`Why is she so resigned to her fate?! `
`Why's she offering us things one after another?! `
`She's tricking us to buy time!! `
`She wants to buy time until 24:00 so that she can go down in flames along with us!!" `
`"............" `
`"Wh-What about the switch itself? `
`Is there some way to tell if it's on or off...?" `
`On the upper part of the antique clock was a metal switch that could slide right or left. `
`Right now, it was set to the left. `
`However, there were no marks in particular on either side to tell one which was "off" and which was "on". `
`"Hey, tell us the truth!! `
`Which way is off?!" `
`"...Left. `
`It's off now." `
`"You idiot! `
`You really expect an honest answer from her?! `
`It's the opposite... It has to be!! `
`The right side must be "off"!!" `
`"W-We don't have any more time, Nee-san...!!" `
`"Quit it, Eva!! `
`Don't touch the switch! `
`It's set to "off" now!!" `
`"Eva-san, take your hand off it!!" `
`"I agree. `
`It's "off" now. `
`If she wanted to kill us with a bomb, she wouldn't have told us about it." `
`".........!!! `
`...B-Beatriiiiiiiice...!! `
`Don't think you can trick me...!!!" `
`"...... `
`...5. `
`...4...3." `
`"Nng, aah...aaaaaaaaaarrrrgggghh!!!" `
`The second hand of the clock...ticked past 24:00. `
`October 4th ended...and the curtain rose on October 5th, 1986... `
`The switch was still pointing to the left. `
`...The witch's words had been proven correct. `
`"...Have I gained your trust now...?" `
`"......Y-You bitch!" `
`With a hideous, sweat-covered expression, Eva snatched the cash card away from the witch's hand. `
`"...How about a bankbook and seal? `
`We can't withdraw anything with just a card!" `
`"All you need is the PIN. `
`It's eight digits long." `
`"W-Wait a second!! `
`I'm writing it down...!!" `
`Eva and Kyrie both took out a pen and notepad and began writing the eight digit number the witch told them. `
`"......That is everything I have to tell you and to give you. `
`...I will say nothing more. `
`All of my tasks have been completed." `
`After saying this, the witch spun around...and sat down on the bed. `
`She wasn't even looking at the others anymore. `
`She sat there like an empty husk which had, just as she had said, finished everything it existed to do... `
`For a while, everyone watched the witch to see if she would remember something else and start talking. `
`However, she said nothing else. `
`The witch who had called herself one of the dead was now little more than a large French doll wearing a black dress... `
`Gold is the only physical embodiment of magic that can exist in the human world. `
`Since ancient times, even a small bit of it could control men with its magic. `
`In that case, how much magic power would dwell in it... `
`if it was piled up in a mountain so high you'd have to look up to see the top? `
`"Don't be stupid, we'll split it evenly! `
`Isn't that the obvious solution?!" `
`"Didn't we say that half of this pile would belong to me, and the other half would be split between the four of us?!" `
`The yells of the humans dancing around the gold reverberated throughout the underground room... `
`In front of the pile of gold, they were arguing about how it should be split. `
`"Did you solve the riddle all by yourself, Nii-san? `
`You didn't, right?! `
`The four of us siblings solved it together! `
`Of course we'll split it in four equal parts!!" `
`"Coward! `
`Weren't you the ones who first made that proposal about the gold's distribution?!! `
`How can you disregard that so easily...?!!" `
`"You really think you're in a position to bargain? `
`When you're the ones hiding Dad's death...?!!" `
`"Y-Yeah, yeah...!! `
`You've been swindling us this whole time, treating Father's wealth as if it were your own...!" `
`"All you need to do is split the gold evenly, and we'll drop all the rest, including that particular issue. `
`It sounds very fair to me." `
`"Well, if you insist, go ahead and try splitting it four ways. `
`Let's divide this pile up right now, and you can all take your own shares home. `
`I hope you have pockets that can hold 2.5 tons of ingots...! `
`It seems you've all been driven mad by the gold and lost all ability to make rational judgements." `
`"What do you mean by that, Krauss nii-san?" `
`"Look at this ingot. `
`As you can see, there are no official markings, just Father's crest. `
`...How do you intend to turn unmarked gold like this into cash?" `
`"Nnng, ...well..." `
`"Have you finally figured it out? `
`This pile of gold may be worth 20 billion yen. `
`However, that's only if you can trade it for cash. `
`Are any of you capable of exchanging this many unmarked, unidentified ingots for cash at the proper rates?!" `
`If it was a necklace or a ring, exchanging it for cash would have been a manageable problem. `
`However, doing that for several tons of unmarked gold that couldn't be made public...would be impossible for any normal person. `
`...However, Krauss could do it. `
`Among the several business friends that remained from Kinzo's generation, there were some who had black market ties and a lot of financial power. `
`The billion yen tied to the cash card that the Golden Witch had held out a second ago... had already been turned to cash thanks to one of Kinzo's connections... `
`However, none of the other siblings had any connections like that. `
`They would have to rely on Krauss to get cash for the gold. `
`"Now you're finally seeing it. `
`I apologize for hiding all of those things about Father. `
`However, you're in no position to take advantage of that weakness." `
`"...Y-You really think you have such an advantage just because of something like that?!?!" `
`"What do you intend to do with that gun? `
`Please, you're scaring us." `
`Eva was gripping the gun so hard it looked like it might snap. `
`...The four guns that the witch had placed in this room were now in the hands of the relatives. `
`Just as the gold had led their hearts astray, `
`it seemed these guns had the magical power to turn their hearts to violence... `
`Finally, a scuffle arose between Eva and Krauss. `
`Off to the side, Natsuhi started arguing with Rudolf and his wife, and the grand underground VIP room was filled with thundering jeers... `
`"............" `
`After being forced to watch this scene for so long, Ange's face was starting to contort with pain. `
`It was only natural, after being shown this abusive argument between her parents and her other relatives. `
`"...What on earth......?" `
`It was painful for Lion too. `
`Lion would have tried to intervene and calm them, if that had been possible. `
`The gold isn't going anywhere, right? `
`If you just slow down and think, you'll be able to resolve this. `
`Going by what Eva and the others said, it's clear that'll they need a lot of money before the end of the year. `
`However, the billion yen cash card should be more than enough to pay for that. `
`That would handle their emergency expenses, so they could then convert the gold to cash at their leisure...and just split it amongst themselves. `
`Sure, maybe Krauss was the only one capable of converting the gold. `
`That might give him an advantage over the other siblings. `
`However, this gold couldn't be dealt with by open means. `
`In addition to attracting public attention, it would also lead to various legal problems. `
`It was better for this secret money to remain secret. `
`If they wanted to get the largest portions possible, then they should all agree not to tell anyone about this gold. `
`In other words, to maximize their profits, they would all need to make a gentleman's agreement...to keep this secret. `
`Krauss did have a slight advantage. `
`However, it was possible for the other relatives to refuse to cooperate and tell the world about the gold. `
`And then, ...there was also the concealment of Kinzo's death to consider. `
`Krauss was an investor. `
`He needed not only financial clout, but also a certain degree of public confidence in him. `
`His advantage isn't big enough for him to act so overbearing. `
`"...The mountain of gold...has made everyone lose their ability to think rationally. `
`...This isn't an argument between adults. `
`...It's just a fight between kids." `
`"What's so fun about showing us this...? `
`Or is this the game of some new witch...? `
`Are they watching us suffer from somewhere and laughing?!" `
`"............" `
`By now, ...even I didn't have a clue who was showing this to us, or for what reason. `
`At the very least, this new tale didn't seem to be overflowing with affection. `
`...At first, I thought it was a tale of a beautiful world, where no crime occurred and Clair's regrets had vanished. `
`But something's different. `
`This tale is clearly filled with ill will towards us. `
`I'm sure of that much now, ...but I don't have a clue who would want to show us this. `
`Suddenly, an explosion rang out. `
`...I didn't think it was the sound of gunfire. `
`After all, ...people living a normal life never hear that kind of sound. `
`*drip*, *drip*drip*drip*. `
`It was the sound of thick raindrops hitting the floor. `
`...There was no rain in this underground room. `
`...It was blood dripping down...from Natsuhi's right eye. `
`The bullet had gone in through her right eye...towards the back of her head... `
`"...N-Natsuhi...?" `
`"...I-It's your fault...for jumping at me..." `
`The gun, ...which fell from Eva's grasp, ...landed on the floor with a hard metallic clang. `
`As though in response to that sound, Natsuhi's head slowly turned to face the ceiling... `
`"...N-Natsuhi... `
`...Natsuhiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!" `
`Natsuhi flopped backwards. `
`When the back of her head hit the floor, a red splash spread out beneath it, ...forming a single flower to adorn her dead face... `
`"Natsuhi...nee-san..." `
`"Wh-Why did you shoot her?! `
`Why? Eva?! Evaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?!?!" `
`Krauss howled, raised his gun, and ran at Eva. `
`At the same time, Hideyoshi leapt between them. `
`A scuffle broke out between the two men. `
`"How could you?! Natsuhiiiiiiiiiiiii, nngaaaaaahhhhh!!" `
`"K-Krauss nii-san, you've got it wrong... You've got it all wrong... It was...just an accident...!!" `
`"Evaaaaaaaaaa, how could you?!! `
`I'll kill you! I'll kill yooooooouuu!!" `
`"I......I didn't shoot... I didn't... `
`Even though I told her to stop, she just jumped at me...!!" `
`Krauss, who had just seen his wife killed before his eyes, had lost all traces of rationality in his expression. `
`He was so furious that, if he had knocked Hideyoshi aside and jumped at Eva, he might have torn her throat out. `
`"Why did you kill her?! Why?! `
`Evaaaaaaaaaaaa!!" `
`"It was an accident, ...an accident...!! `
`Calm down, Krauss nii-san...!! `
`...Owowowow......nngggggghhhh..." `
`Another explosion rang out. `
`Hideyoshi's face was covered with blood. `
`The two of them had been fighting over the gun Krauss held, trying to push it away from themselves. `
`When the barrel had turned to point at Krauss's chin, ...the sneering, formless reaper, master of the room of gold, had swung its scythe once more. `
`A line of blood...trickled from Krauss's mouth. `
`"U...Uwaaaaahhhh, ...hyaaaaaaaaahhhhh...!!" `
`The two fell down, with Krauss's body on top of Hideyoshi. `
`Letting out a cowardly cry, Hideyoshi backed away before Krauss's body could cover him... `
`"...D-Dear...!!" `
`"I didn't do anything!! `
`Krauss nii-san's finger just got caught on the trigger...! `
`It's an accident, ...an accident I tell you...!!" `
`"Th-That's right, an accident... This was all an accident...!!" `
`As the pair of them broke down sobbing and repeatedly claiming that it was all an accident, Rosa and the others were unable to say a thing... `
`The witch also watched this scene, but said nothing, and appeared to be completely disinterested. `
`"...I-It wasn't our fault...! `
`It was just an accident...! `
`You saw, right?! Right? Right?!" `
`"You saw that, didn't you, Rosa?! `
`Krauss nii-san and Natsuhi nee-san both let their emotions get ahold of them and charged at us...!" `
`"...Who knows? `
`I couldn't say either way." `
`"Stupid Rosa!! `
`You saw, didn't you?! `
`You saw it from right there, so you must know!!" `
`"I'm sorry. `
`I can't tell if it happened by accident...or if you killed them and tried to make it look like an accident." `
`"R-Rosa, you...!!!" `
`"Rudolf-kun...! `
`You saw! `
`You know what happened, right?! `
`Right?!" `
`"...... `
`...Sorry, but I agree with Rosa. `
`We can't tell if it was an accident or intentional." `
`Rosa's and Rudolf's gazes looked very cold and indifferent to Eva and her husband. `
`"What are we going to do? They were shot to death...! `
`Saying it was a simple accident won't convince anyone...!!" `
`"Th-The forest! `
`We'll say they went to the forest and went missing! That will buy us some time...!" `
`"That won't get us off the hook, right?! `
`The police will just search the whole forest!! `
`And anyway, why would those two go off into an uncultivated forest like that?! `
`It'll look suspicious from the start! `
`There's no way we'll get away with it!!" `
`"It'll be okay...! `
`If we hide the corpses here, no one will be able to find them! `
`If we all play dumb, it'll work!" `
`"It won't... `
`There's no way you can fool the police. `
`If the two of them disappear during a family conference where we were arguing over the inheritance problem, `
`...the police won't just put it down as a case of missing persons." `
`"...... `
`...I-I just had an idea..." `
`Though Eva had been scratching at her head, overcome with emotion, `
`...her arms suddenly fell as though their strings had been cut. `
`"...Wh-What did you think of?" `
`"...An accident. `
`...We just need to make it look like an accident." `
`"Idiot...! `
`What kind of accident...?! `
`There are clear gunshot wounds on both corpses, right?! `
`Even if we burn them to make it look like they were caught in a fire, it'll still be obvious that they were killed by guns!!" `
`"...A fire? `
`That's not good enough. `
`...We need more. `
`A much more massive accident." `
`"...A-A massive accident...?" `
`Eva slowly walked forward, ...tapped it, and spoke. `
`"An explosion accident. `
`...We just need the sort of accident that will leave no traces of their corpses." `
`As she played with the switch that would cause an automatic explosion at 24:00, `
`...Eva spun around to look at them, a crazed expression on her face... `
`It was truly...a mad flash of inspiration. `
`If they flipped the switch to the right and waited for 24:00, the 900 tons of explosives would wipe out the mansion without a trace. `
`There wouldn't even be anything left of the corpses. `
`There certainly wouldn't be any way to tell that they had died by gunshot wounds before the explosion. `
`"It's an unshakable fact that this island is still filled with explosives from the war! `
`Then, by coincidence, tomorrow night...something will set it off by chance and the whole thing will explode!! `
`Yes, it'll be an accident! `
`An explosion accident!! `
`What do you say?!! `
`There's no way the police will find out the truth!! `
`This way, we can pull it off!! `
`We can hide the manner of their deaths!!" `
`"Ha...hahaha... That's...crazy..." `
`Shaking, Hideyoshi frantically searched for a counterargument, hoping to shut down Eva's mad idea. `
`......But he couldn't find one. `
`If they blew everything up, the facts would all be muddled... `
`They could make it look as though Krauss and Natsuhi had died in an explosion accident...! `
`"It's perfect, just perfect...!!! `
`After all, it was an accident that they died anyway! `
`We're just changing the type of accident!! `
`Isn't that right? `
`We can think up any story we want!! `
`By chance, the rest of us will happen to be in the hidden mansion tomorrow night! `
`Then, when the explosion accident occurs, we'll be lucky enough to survive!! `
`That story should work!!" `
`"...J-Just what sort of story are you planning on? `
`...What kind of story could explain how the two of them alone remained here `
`while the rest of us conveniently went to the hidden mansion and managed to escape...?!" `
`"That's what we've got to think up now, stupid Rosa!!! `
`It doesn't matter what it is, as long as we all agree to it!! `
`I'll think of something... I {i:am} thinking... You all think too!! `
`Someone think of somethiiiiiiiiiiiing!!!" `
`"C-Calm down, Eva... `
`I'll think about it, and so will everyone else! `
`We'll definitely think of something, and it'll all work out! `
`We'll share the burden. You won't have to carry it all yourself...!! `
`It'll all be okay... It will!! `
`I know we'll think of a good excuse!" `
`"...What kind of excuse? `
`We took the kids and all the servants to go exploring an underground passageway, leaving just the two of them behind, `
`and the rest of us all decided to spend the night in the hidden mansion? `
`How could any excuse work? `
`...It's insane!" `
`"And thinking up that insane thing is our job!! `
`Why are you acting like this has nothing to do with you?! `
`You think of something too!!!" `
`"......Nee-san, `
`let me ask you a question. `
`...If you blow up the island, what will happen to this gold?" `
`"Nnng, ...w-well......" `
`"We've finally gotten our hands on 20 billion yen of gold. `
`And you want to blow it all away...?" `
`"We can just carry it away...yeah, that's right!! `
`The explosion will happen tomorrow at midnight! `
`We have a full day!! `
`If we all carry it together, we might-" `
`"You realize there's 10 tons of it, right? `
`...Just how much do you think our small group can carry `
`back and forth across this long, underground passage that goes all the way across the island? `
`You're being absurd." `
`"H-Here!! `
`We have this card, right?! `
`The card worth a billion yen, the one that woman gave us!! `
`We'll just carry as much gold as we can! `
`We have the card with a billion yen on top of that! `
`If we split that three ways, we'll have more than 300 million each! `
`That should be enough for all of our purposes!!" `
`"I don't like it." `
`"...Y-You don't like what...?" `
`"We have a mountain worth 20 billion yen right here. `
`Why should we be satisfied with just 300 million each?" `
`"...R-Rosaaaaa..." `
`Eva's face twisted in anguish...and was met by Rosa's look of cold unconcern. `
`"...If we gave Krauss nii-san his share, `
`we'd each have a share of 5 billion. `
`Subtract the 300 million from the card, and the rest of my share is 4.7 billion. `
`...If you agree to pay that much to me, then you can do whatever you want with this mountain of gold." `
`"What do you think you're saying?! `
`So, you don't intend to cooperate?!" `
`"Nee-san, `
`please calm down and listen. `
`This plan will let both of us leave with the maximum amount of money." `
`"Wh-What...?!?!" `
`"I want you to go to the police and turn yourself in, admitting that you got into a scuffle and the gun went off." `
`"A-Are you crazy?! I don't want to go to the police!!!" `
`"Of course, we don't want to say that the crime happened here. `
`The police would find the gold. `
`...Yes, how about the rose garden? `
`It's pouring rain now, so the police probably won't find any contradictions at the crime scene." `
`"I'll let you think of an excuse for why you and Nii-san started fighting while you were holding guns in the rainy rose garden. `
`...Please, don't try to get us and our shares involved just because you want to hide your own crime." `
`"R-Rosaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!" `
`"It's not so bad, right? `
`After all, it's not like they'll keep you in jail for several decades. `
`It was an accident, right? You'll be able to get out after just a few years. `
`...When you've paid for your sins and come back, then you can do whatever you want with your 5 billion." `
`"No, I'd never do that!! `
`What would happen if we were arrested?! `
`What would happen to my husband's company?!" `
`"Who cares about the company? `
`With 5 billion yen, working any longer would just be a waste of time, right?" `
`Rosa had never intended to go along with Eva's proposal. `
`If it was a question of maximizing each person's portion, no one had anything to gain from an explosion accident. `
`An explosion would conceal Krauss and Natsuhi's deaths. `
`...And it would serve no further purpose. `
`From Rosa's perspective, the ideal outcome would be for them to confess to their crimes, without any unnecessary tricks. `
`All she wanted was to change the crime scene from here to a different place. `
`However, Eva didn't want to be arrested. `
`She didn't like having her share shrink from 5 billion to 300 million, `
`but even that was more than enough to cover the amount she had been trying to wring out of Krauss in the first place. `
`She wanted to hide what had happened here, even if it meant blowing away 4.7 billion yen. `
`What would happen if they were arrested? `
`The life, the company and the trust that Eva had worked so long to build...were things that couldn't be bought back with money. `
`So, she wanted to hide Krauss and Natsuhi's deaths, even if it meant blowing up all 4.7 billion yen worth of her gold...! `
`But from Rosa's perspective, that was just irrational nonsense. `
`"R-Rosaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!" `
`"What do you think you're doing with that gun, Nee-san? `
`...Are you going to have me die in the explosion too? `
`That'll make finding an excuse even harder. `
`In fact, it'll make it harder to explain away the other two deaths as accidents too..." `
`"Three whole deaths means it'll be quite a large-scale crime. `
`...It would probably get you the death penalty. `
`Or life in prison, if you're lucky. `
`Even in the best case, you'll probably be put away for more than a decade, right?" `
`"Turn yourself in. `
`If you do, this will be no more than a pair of unfortunate accidents. `
`Of course, your jail term won't be too terrible either. `
`...Don't worry about George-kun. `
`We'll take good care of him. `
`And we'll make sure that your entire share of 5 billion yen is waiting for you when you get back." `
`Eva ground her teeth and glared. `
`The Rosa she knew should've been shaking and obeying her commands. `
`And yet, ...Rosa wasn't scared. `
`Her blank expression... `
`no, that faint smile...was one that Eva had never seen before. `
`"Put the gun down, Nee-san. `
`Once you calm down, you'll see that my plan is the best one. `
`...Jail isn't so bad, right? `
`Think of it as a financial strategy." `
`"Even if they put you in for ten years, there will be 5 billion waiting for you when you get out. `
`That's like working for a 500 million yen salary, right? `
`If you think of it that way, won't you enjoy your job more?" `
`"Liar!!! `
`You just want to steal my share away while I'm in there!! `
`Like your man did to you!!!" `
`"H-He has nothing to do with this, okay?!?! `
`I won't run away... I'd never run away with someone's money... `
`...Ooohhh, ...I'll never do iiiiiiiiiiiit!!!" `
`Rosa's once-frigid face was filled with rage. `
`The two howling people pointed their guns at each other, shouting insults... `
`You could smell the gold room's reaper slinking closer. `
`The smell of gunpowder, the explosive smell of death, ...filled the room... `
`*drip*. `
`A bubble of blood dripped from Rosa's mouth. `
`Then, ...she fell over lifelessly, like a mannequin someone had pushed over. `
`"...E-Eva...?!" `
`"...I-It wasn't me! `
`I swear I didn't even pull the trigger!" `
`"......The round in the chamber of your gun was spent when you fired at Natsuhi-san, right...? `
`You never reloaded, so even if you pull the trigger, that gun won't kill anyone. `
`Have no fear." `
`As Kyrie said this, she maneuvered the lever action with a practiced hand, and a smoke-smelling shell casing was ejected... `
`It hit the floor with a small, metallic sound. `
`That tiny sound had a disturbing ring to it... `
`"Rosa-san's analysis was a little naive. `
`...She has no idea how difficult it would be `
`to exchange this many unmarked gold ingots for money." `
`"...Back in Dad's day, even just showing this gold to get funding was enough to create the massive rumor called the Ushiromiya Legend of the Gold. `
`...Exchanging this for cash is impossible. `
`A pile of gold you can't use is no better than a pile of crap." `
`""10 tons of gold were exchanged for cash on the black market, and the Successor and his wife died mysterious deaths." `
`Expecting that to go unnoticed is what's really unbelievable. `
`...We don't want to get the police involved. `
`We'll blow up this island and destroy all the evidence. `
`If it's tough parting with the gold, feel free to grab as much as you can hold. `
`The billion yen on the cash card is more than enough. `
`...In other words, Eva nee-san was right." `
`"I......I'm glad... `
`...It looks like we're on the same page... `
`...I-If the police get involved, who knows what might happen? `
`It's the same with cashing in the gold. `
`I'm sure that would have tripped us up somewhere, so we had no choice...!!" `
`"The 1 billion that woman over there exchanged for cash is the only money we'll be able to get our hands on! `
`And even splitting that billion, it'll be more than enough for what we need...! `
`On top of that, now that Rosa is dead, our shares have increased even more...! `
`We can each leave this island with 500 million...!" `
`"Exactly. `
`As long as we don't let our greedy desire to cash in the gold control us, `
`...we can pretend that everything that occurred on this island never happened. `
`We have a way to do that right here." `
`By this point, neither deaths from accidental discharges nor shooting murders meant anything on this island. `
`Everything would be erased equally by the explosion accident. `
`No matter what happened between now and midnight the next day, everything would be rewritten. `
`"...And you told me...to turn myself in?! Stupid Rosa...! `
`You weren't satisfied with just 300 million? `
`This is what you get for being too greedy... `
`...Y-You brought this upon yourself..." `
`"But Kyrie-san, ...there was no need to shoot her, right...? `
`Even Rosa-san would've figured it out if you'd just told her..." `
`"I did need to shoot her. `
`After all, Rosa-san's the only one who didn't fire her gun." `
`"...What does that matter...?" `
`"The guns lying at your feet are Krauss nii-san's and Eva nee-san's. `
`Both of those have been fired. `
`However, Rosa-san's gun can shoot if you just pull the trigger. `
`It's hard to reload one of these if you aren't used to a lever action. `
`An amateur would have some trouble pulling it off." `
`"Kyrie-san, what are you talking about...?" `
`"Y-You...!!" `
`They finally realized what Kyrie meant. `
`"Rosa had the only gun that could still fire, so I shot her first." `
`Oh, how foolish we were... Why didn't we realize sooner? `
`Even though we knew there's a mechanism for erasing everything that happens on this island... `
`Eva and Hideyoshi hurried to pick up the guns that lay at their feet. `
`At the same time, fire spat from Kyrie's gun once more. `
`Hideyoshi let out a short scream, clutched at his chest, and fell over face-down. `
`"Dear?! `
`Dear...!! `
`...Wah, ...why is this-" `
`Eva fiddled with the lever action, trying to imitate something she vaguely remembered from a western movie, `
`but something seemed to be caught, and the still-open lever didn't budge. `
`"See? `
`It's pretty hard." `
`"...Y-You...!!!" `
`Kyrie finished reloading with a fluid motion. `
`The way she held it was as innocent and sure as a kid playing with a squirt gun. `
`With another heartless cry of gunfire, the puppet called Eva slumped down to the floor `
`as though its strings had been cut... `
`"...Rudolf-san, `
`the billion yen card." `
`"Sure..." `
`The cash card with a billion yen, which Eva had just grabbed from the witch... `
`That alone was worth more than enough. `
`The 20 billion yen pile of gold had skewed everyone's sense of value. `
`Just a few million yen is enough for people to kill over. `
`And this was a billion yen. `
`"Rosa-san, `
`those were some famous last words there. `
`"Just 300 million?" `
`...You were too greedy." `
`"Heheh... `
`No kidding. `
`...Ah, lucky me. `
`I don't have to fish through her corpse." `
`As Rudolf walked up to Eva's body, he found the card lying beside it...and picked it up. `
`"So, this flimsy little card is worth a billion yen... `
`...Sticking with the company would be a waste of time. `
`So, do we close up shop and spend the rest of our lives in some southern country?" `
`"I'm sure you'd get bored right away. `
`Besides, I like seeing you get all worried about some problem, then leap around like a little kid when you finally overcome it." `
`"Heheheh...! `
`Sure you do..." `
`"Thank you, Ms. Golden Witch. `
`...Rudolf-san and I will make good use of this billion." `
`"............" `
`"Krauss nii-san promised to treat you in a gentlemanly fashion. `
`But I haven't made any such promise." `
`...She pulled the trigger without a trace of mercy. `
`When the ringing of the gunfire died down, ...blood trickled from the witch's mouth, and she fell over onto the bed. `
`Once again, Kyrie ejected the used shell casing. `
`The four metal sounds of used shells hitting the floor seemed to symbolize the fact that Rudolf and his wife now possessed all shares of the gold... `
`"...All of them were really slow-witted... `
`...From the moment they heard about the bomb, they should've known that they wouldn't be leaving this island as a big, happy family." `
`"Sorry 'bout this, Aniki, Aneki, Rosa. `
`...Well, that's life for you. `
`Give me a break, okay? `
`Aniki and Aneki get into a fight, Rosa gets dragged in, `
`and I'm the one who picks up the pieces. `
`...Just like it's always been, right?" `
`It wasn't as though Rudolf and Kyrie had planned to kill everyone and take everything for themselves from the start. `
`Kyrie had quickly realized, by the length of the barrel of the gun in her hands, that it would probably hold five rounds at a time. `
`......Yes. `
`Kyrie and Rudolf were both very familiar with this gun. `
`Rudolf, whose interest in guns from old westerns came from his Father, owned a shotgun of the same model. `
`Even Kyrie had earned the qualifications to use that gun, becoming familiar enough with it that they could go shooting together for fun... `
`Including the witch, there had been eight people there. `
`Six people besides the two of them. `
`Each gun held five rounds. `
`...That was one short. `
`They didn't have enough to kill everyone. `
`"...To be honest, it really surprised me when they got into a fight and one of the guns went off." `
`That coincidental accident...had provided the missing bullet. `
`It wasn't the second shot. `
`The very first shot, which had accidentally killed Natsuhi, had guaranteed that this massacre would happen... `
`In this smoke and corpse-filled room of gold, the two of them wore easygoing smiles, hardly any different from those they usually wore... `
`"...What `
`do we do now?" `
`Rudolf picked up Rosa's gun. `
`Then, he fired a test shot at the wall and ejected the old shell with a smooth motion like Kyrie's. `
`Kyrie went to the box of bullets on the table, casually picked up a few, and loaded them one after another into her gun. `
`"Set the bomb switch to "on". `
`Then, we just need to wait 24 hours." `
`"Everyone's gonna run wild when morning comes and they can't find us." `
`"Then we just need to make sure they don't." `
`"Guess so. `
`...What about Battler?" `
`"He's your son. `
`Not mine." `
`"Don't say that. `
`Look how attached he is to you. `
`He really respects you." `
`"Then think of a clever way to trick him. `
`I'll worry about Ange. `
`You worry about Battler-kun. `
`Fair enough?" `
`"Nng, ...sure." `
`"I'm kind to my own children, `
`...but it's a real pain to be nice to Asumu-san's kid. `
`You understand, I hope?" `
`"............" `
`Kyrie's voice had grown cold. `
`She had acted warmly towards Battler because that had been the adult thing to do. `
`He was Rudolf's son, so she tried to avoid being hostile, nothing more. `
`But underneath, he was the son of Asumu, a woman Kyrie still hated even though she was dead. `
`Now that she had given birth to Ange and finally built up a new family, `
`......was Battler's return really such a happy thing for her...? `
`"Get yourself ready. `
`Now that we've come this far, `
`...we can only go for the billion yen or die trying. `
`If you can't convince Battler-kun, I'm sorry, but I won't be taking any chances." `
`"...No need to threaten me. `
`I'll take care of it. `
`I'll find a good story to tell him." `
`"Make sure you do. `
`...I know Ange will be very sad if she's forced to hear about Battler-kun dying in an accident." `
`"Sure... `
`......... `
`...How do we start?" `
`"We have nothing to gain by waiting for morning. `
`Now is the best time." `
`"...Oh, wonderful. `
`Not even time for a break." `
`"...A test? `
`What's this supposed to be? `
`At this time of night? `
`Starting now?" `
`Battler yelled wildly into the receiver. `
`When he said "at this time of night", George and Jessica turned to look. `
`According to the clock, it was past midnight. `
`It might be a normal time to be told to brush their teeth and go to bed, but he couldn't understand what this test thing was all about. `
`"Okay, I'll hand it over. `
`...Here, George-aniki. `
`It's my dad." `
`"...Hello, `
`this is George speaking." `
`"Ah, hey, George-kun. `
`Sorry to call so late. `
`You weren't sleeping already, were you? `
`You're all still up chatting away?" `
`"Pretty much. `
`Maria-chan is sleeping...oh, wait, it looks like she just woke up. `
`So, what did you want to talk about? `
`Battler-kun said something about a test..." `
`"Ah, yeah. `
`Dad can be such a pain sometimes. `
`He suddenly came down from his room. `
`A bunch of stuff happened, and by the end, he was talking about which grandchild would make the best Successor." `
`"...But isn't Uncle Krauss the Successor?" `
`"He says the four of us aren't up to the job, `
`...so he's gonna skip us adults and choose one of you grandkids instead. `
`It's all so sudden, we're really freaking out here. `
`Aniki and the others are all arguing about it across the room. `
`I'll bet you can hear Aneki shrieking in the background, huh?" `
`"...I-Is that so? `
`If that's what Grandfather says, then there's no way around it, I guess... `
`In that case, what should we do?" `
`"He says he wants to call you out one by one, starting with Jessica-chan. `
`...Oh, wait a sec. `
`............... `
`...Okay, you still there? `
`It looks like you and Jessica-chan will be the first up to bat. `
`He wants Jessica-chan to go to the parlor in the mansion. `
`You're supposed to go out in front of the chapel." `
`"It's so sudden, I hardly feel ready... `
`What sort of test is it?" `
`"It looks like Dad made some kind of crazy quiz. `
`...Some weird questions about what it means to be the Head." `
`Of course, a few things about this seemed off to George. `
`However, Kinzo was famous for doing radical things on a whim. `
`...Even this strange test seemed plausible once he heard that it was a sudden idea of Kinzo's. `
`...But even so, if he wanted to test them one by one, why wouldn't he call them out one by one? `
`They could have just had everyone wait in some reception room to be called in one at a time. `
`Why would two people be called to different places at the same time? `
`The plan didn't seem to make sense, and George felt he was missing something. `
`"Still, I wonder why he wanted to meet you in front of the chapel, of all places. `
`...He expects a lot from you. `
`I think he wants to talk to you alone, not sure what about." `
`"...Grandfather...wants to talk to me?" `
`"I wonder what he's got to say. `
`I mean, you're the most talented of all his grandkids. `
`He's probably got something to tell you in particular, right? `
`...Anyway, that's what he says. `
`Get over there right away. `
`I'm supposed to go to the chapel too, `
`so let's get this over with, `
`or we're both gonna catch colds." `
`"......I see. `
`Okay. `
`Then I'll head towards the front of the chapel, `
`and Jessica-chan will go to the parlor. `
`...Sure. `
`I'll see you in a bit, then." `
`What sort of test or private conversation...could Kinzo possibly want to have at this time of night? `
`Then again, it's a well-known fact that Kinzo doesn't have long to live. `
`It wouldn't be so strange if he wanted to give some sort of will to each of his descendants individually... `
`Inside George's mind, the faint feeling that something was wrong...was replaced by a desire to meet Kinzo directly and hear about this in more detail. `
`George set down the receiver and quickly explained to the others. `
`"It's as you heard. `
`......Grandfather says he wants to give us all some kind of test." `
`"Uu-? `
`A test...?" `
`"After hiding in his study all these years, he suddenly decides to give us a test this late at night? `
`...Damn that old geezer. `
`What's he thinking?" `
`"It seems our parents feel the same way. `
`It sounds as though they're very worked up about it." `
`"Well, I doubt getting worked up about it will change Grandfather's mind." `
`"Exactly. `
`...We might as well accept it. `
`It's Grandfather's order, after all. `
`Let's obey it. `
`...To start, Jessica-chan and I are being called out. `
`I'm going to the chapel. `
`Jessica-chan is supposed to go to the parlor in the mansion." `
`"What about Maria and me?" `
`"I think they'll contact you later. `
`Wait here." `
`"Uu-! `
`A midnight test! `
`What could it be?! `
`What kind of test is it?! `
`A quiz? `
`A puzzle? `
`I'm really good at wolves and sheep puzzles! `
`Uu-!" `
`Maria, who was now fully awake, seemed to be very excited about this unexpected midnight test. `
`"Then we'll just hang out here." `
`"Yes. `
`Okay, I'm going. `
`It sounds like they're already waiting for us." `
`"...So, he's making one of his grandkids the Successor. `
`Sounds great to me. `
`Now I can let one of you guys deal with it!" `
`"I'm gonna become the Successor! `
`I wanna do it! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!" `
`"Ahaha. `
`Having Maria as the Successor wouldn't be so bad." `
`"Bye. `
`See you later." `
`Rudolf put down the receiver and stood up. `
`"Okay. `
`...Guess I'm going to the spot in front of the chapel. `
`It's damn cold out there. `
`...Gohda-san, `
`have some coffee waiting for me when I get back, will you?" `
`Next to Rudolf, ...Gohda was lying face-up. `
`His face was covered by a crossword puzzle book. `
`However, its pages were stained with blood, and you didn't need to move the book to imagine how he had met his pitiful end... `
`"How was it? `
`A nice script, don't you think?" `
`"Yep. `
`We should be thanking Dad. `
`If we just say it was him being fickle, no one's gonna doubt us." `
`"*giggle* `
`Then let's split up. `
`...I'll take care of Jessica-chan. `
`You take care of George-kun." `
`"You got it. `
`...Let's get this over with quickly, so we can relax and have some coffee." `
`"There won't be any problems, yes? `
`...No sudden pangs of conscience?" `
`Kyrie smiled coldly... `
`It probably would have been safer to call them out one by one and finish them off together. `
`...However, Kyrie had chosen to have her husband work separately. `
`She wanted to measure Rudolf's resolve. `
`If she was the only one who got her hands dirty, and Rudolf just watched, his heart wouldn't be as dedicated to this venture. `
`By having him dirty his own hands, she could make him truly determined to see this thing through. `
`...Kyrie understood this sort of mind game better than anyone else. `
`Rudolf reflexively averted his gaze from the cold glint in her eyes, but then he just shrugged and answered her question. `
`"Of course. `
`......We have a billion yen riding on this. `
`And I'm a man. `
`I'm not gonna miss a chance that'll never come again in my lifetime." `
`"...I expected no less of you, Rudolf-san. `
`...I love people who seize chances when they come. `
`That's why I fell in love with you." `
`"Th-Thanks... `
`I'm glad." `
`"Rudolf-san." `
`"What...?" `
`"Stay like that...always, okay?" `
`"Huh? `
`What did you say?" `
`"Always remain the same Rudolf-san I love, `
`...okay?" `
`"...Of course. `
`When have I ever let you down? `
`...You should be worrying more about what kind of champagne we'll use to toast our victory." `
`"I'll do that. `
`......Take care, now. `
`If you really treasure Battler-kun, don't kill George-kun in front of the chapel, okay? `
`It'll be a pain if he finds the body." `
`"...Yeah, I know. `
`...I'll lure him away somehow. `
`We'll be outside, and it's raining. `
`Should be some way to do it." `
`"And you aren't a villain in some old western, got it? `
`Don't grant any last requests or take down any final messages, okay?" `
`Kyrie lifted up her gun again and ran the lever... `
`...To eject the casing from the round she had killed Gohda with. `
`"......Dear... `
`...Deeeeeeeeear... `
`Waaaaaaahhhhh..." `
`Eva was holding Hideyoshi's body and crying. `
`She hadn't been shot at all. `
`The bullet had grazed her head...and missed. `
`She hadn't been playing dead. `
`She really thought that she'd been shot. `
`When Kyrie's gun spat fire, Eva felt something fierce skim past her head... `
`before feeling light-headed and fainting. `
`Then, she had awoken in the now silent room of the gold. `
`The remains of her beloved husband lay beside her. `
`As well as Krauss, Natsuhi, and Rosa's corpses. `
`It was a room of death and piled up bodies... `
`When she had cried all she could over Hideyoshi's body, `
`...she realized that she still had something she needed to do. `
`"...George is in danger... `
`...George, ...George...!" `
`They're trying to use the bomb to blow up everything, to bury this whole island with an "explosion accident". `
`...Of course. `
`As Eva had expected, the switch on the clock was set to the right, which meant that it was active. `
`Eva moved to flip it to the left...and stopped. `
`That's right. `
`As long as this switch points to the right, ...everything that happens will disappear in this night of illusions. `
`Yes, this is an illusion. `
`No matter what happens tonight, everything will become muddled and hidden away. `
`"They're probably going to kill everyone else. `
`That has to be it... I'm sure of it...!" `
`When she looked at the table with the box of bullets, `
`she saw signs that they had roughly grabbed a bunch of bullets before leaving. `
`It clearly showed...that they planned to use that many bullets. `
`...I have to fight. `
`...If only to protect just the life of my precious son... `
`The gun that I dropped when I was shot is stuck with the lever open. `
`No matter how hard I pull, it won't open any further, and it won't close again. `
`...Apparently, a bullet has gotten jammed, breaking it. `
`...It's just as Kyrie said. `
`Loading a bullet is tough if you aren't used to it. `
`"Please, `
`dear... `
`Lend me your strength... `
`...Lend me your strength, `
`so that I can protect George..." `
`In Hideyoshi's hand was Krauss's gun, which he had been trying to pick up. `
`Eva took it, ...prayed to her husband one more time, and tugged on the lever handle. `
`...With a light metallic sound, `
`...the golden casing spun through the air... `
`and bounced off the ground. `
`When she timidly tried to push the lever back, `
`...this time it returned to its original place without any resistance. `
`...There was another metallic clang. `
`It was the sound of a new bullet being loaded... `
`"...Hmph. `
`I figured it'd be something like this. `
`...Someone's scheming to show me the game that'd disgust me most, just to mock me..." `
`In the games so far, various people have been suspected of being the culprit or an accomplice. `
`The only difference now was that Rudolf and Kyrie were those suspects... `
`However, to Ange, that was the most infuriating plot twist possible. `
`"............" `
`Even Lion was full of painful thoughts. `
`Solving the epitaph was supposed to be the only miracle that could lead to a game without a single victim, `
`...but ironically, the tragedy hadn't been averted even so. `
`Does this mean we aren't allowed to have a future where we all happily return from this island alive, `
`...even if the epitaph is miraculously solved before the crime occurs...? `
`A miracle certainly will not occur. `
`...Those words, which I had heard in one of the Fragments Bernkastel had shown me, raced through my mind... `
`"Bernkastel-san... `
`You showed me how wonderful my world was... `
`...I don't want to believe that you created this tale just to hurt Ange..." `
`"...By now, even I realize that you're the Game Master here. `
`...Please, tell me. `
`...Why are you showing us this game...?" `
`Of course, no one answered Lion's muttered question. `
`The game created to mock Ange continued emotionlessly, `
`...with more terrible twists that didn't betray anyone's expectations anymore... `
`"Ha! `
`Show whatever terrible game you like! `
`You're trying to say that this is one of the endless possibilities inside the cat box, right?! `
`Just do whatever you want...! `
`I won't let something like this get to me!! `
`Someday, I'll find out the truth of what happened on October 5th, 1986!!" `
`After meeting Kyrie in the parlor, Jessica was told that the test would be held in the dining hall, and she followed Kyrie there... `
`"......Aunt Kyrie, there's no one here." `
`"He'll be here soon. `
`Sit over there." `
`"............" `
`Jessica sat in the chair she had been offered, looking nervous and agitated. `
`Kyrie was by far the calmer of the two. `
`Kyrie closed the door behind her, revealing the gun that rested behind it. `
`Jessica was facing the other way, so she saw nothing... `
`"...Did you hear anything about this, Aunt Kyrie? `
`Like what kind of test this is?" `
`"Yes. `
`It'll be over soon." `
`"I sure hope so." `
`As she complained, Jessica turned her head around, and the tip of her nose bumped into cold metal. `
`"......Huh-" `
`"U-Uncle Rudolf...?! `
`What...are you doing...?" `
`"Heheh. `
`I guess shooting people in the back just isn't for me after all." `
`"...H-Hey, ...that was dangerous. `
`What on earth are you doing...?!" `
`"Come on, why else would someone point a gun and pull the trigger?" `
`Rudolf reloaded rapidly and pulled the trigger again without any sign of hesitation. `
`As the sound of gunfire thundered through the rain, George grabbed at his side and fell to his knees... `
`"Unnggg...ggnhh...!!" `
`"That's weird. `
`I guess it really does shoot low. `
`...This gun's really got it bad." `
`"S-Somebody...!! `
`Help me, ...Uncle Rudolf is...!!" `
`George started stumbling away, still clutching at his side. `
`His voice as he called for help was weak and thin. `
`In comparison, Rudolf, who stood behind him, looked perfectly calm as he fiddled with his gun and checked his sights. `
`"...It hurts... ...It hurts... `
`...Gah, ...nngg...!" `
`It felt to George as though something had been gouged into his side. `
`It was so painful that he could barely stand and walk... `
`He leaned against the trunk of a tree. `
`After he crouched down, trying to cover his wound, ...he was no longer able to stand back up. `
`George didn't have a clue what was going on. `
`However, he had felt as though something was wrong this whole time. `
`Of course it was strange that he'd be called out alone to a place like this, at a time like this. `
`...And yet, `
`...how could he have known that something was wrong...? `
`After all, `
`...his own uncle... `
`had told him that his grandfather was asking him to join the family conference. `
`...How could he have suspected...? `
`"...Sorry 'bout this, George-kun. `
`It hurts, doesn't it? `
`If I knew it'd come to this, it would've been kinder to blow out your brains from behind. `
`I thought it'd be too cruel to finish you off before you knew what hit you, but it looks like I got it backwards." `
`"......Wh- `
`Why, `
`Uncle Rudolf...? `
`Why would... `
`...my kind uncle... `
`do... `
`this......?" `
`"Forget about this. `
`By tomorrow night, all of it won't have happened." `
`With a quick use of the lever handle, he loaded another bullet. `
`The casing of the bullet that had pierced George's side fell heartlessly in front of him... `
`"Everyone's gonna die in a sudden, unfortunate accident. `
`Until that moment, we'll all be a big, happy family. `
`...That's how it's gonna be. `
`So don't worry about this. `
`Forget it all." `
`Of course, George didn't have a clue what Rudolf was talking about. `
`All he knew was that Rudolf wanted to kill him, and that he showed no trace of hesitation... `
`...His image of Rudolf as the ideal cool, joke-loving adult... `
`didn't match up with the man standing in front of him, holding a gun. `
`No, maybe this feels wrong because it fits him too well. `
`He has that same smile, as though he's about to tell some hilarious joke, `
`...but he's pointing a gun at me. `
`...Why would that kind, `
`...funny Uncle Rudolf... `
`...do this...? `
`It made him feel unimaginably sad, ...and tears flowed from his eyes. `
`"Uu, ...uuuuuu...Uncle Rudolf... `
`......I......admired you so much......" `
`"Haven't I always told you, George-kun? `
`...Make sure you don't end up as an adult like me. `
`Now you see why. `
`In the next world, make learning how to spot villains your first priority. `
`...I know you can do it. `
`After all, it's just another kind of studying." `
`"Uu...*hic*...gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!" `
`He bit down the pain in his side. `
`...With the last of his strength, George threw his whole body into a roundhouse kick. `
`At the same time, fire spat from Rudolf's gun. `
`...The bullet pierced George's chest. `
`George spun around as he fell amidst an outpouring of blood. `
`He moaned wordlessly, clenching bloodstained teeth. `
`A frigid gun was pressed harshly against his temple. `
`"So long. `
`...Go become a great man in the next world. `
`Don't get blinded by money like me." `
`"...I can't believe... `
`...that my uncle... `
`...would kill for money... `
`Aaaaaaaahhhhh......" `
`"You're so innocent. `
`...People can kill... `
`over money." `
`The ruthless trigger forestalled any further questions. `
`George's hands, which had been covering his wound, dropped lifelessly... `
`When Rudolf saw the last glimmer of life leave him, he sighed deeply and looked tired. `
`"Heh, ...hahahahahahahahahaha. `
`......That was easier than I'd thought." `
`Rudolf looked up into the dark, rainy sky, the rain drops hitting him full in the face, `
`...and laughed with an indescribable expression, his tongue hanging out. `
`"I thought my conscience would bug me more. `
`...Now that it's over, it was pretty easy." `
`*giggle*giggle*, `
`gahahahahahaha. `
`Rudolf laughed. `
`This was probably just the thing Kyrie had hoped for. `
`It had taken considerable effort to kill George. `
`...He may have been merciless, but the last traces of a conscience in Rudolf's heart had probably slowed him down. `
`However, now that he had killed someone with his own hands, a turning point that few people ever reach, ...Rudolf had finally awakened. `
`...No, he finally understood. `
`"...It's just like squeezing dough out of a bunch of morons. `
`...The same old game of musical chairs. `
`If there's a pile of money in front of you, the first one to reach it wins. `
`The slow ones just get kicked down to hell." `
`Haven't I driven dozens of poor fools into debt with my earlier swindles? `
`Several of those probably ended up bankrupt, and some of those might've hanged themselves. `
`And I always laughed like it was none of my business. `
`And that's all there is to it. `
`The only difference now is that, for the first time, `
`...I've dealt the final blow with my own hands. `
`"...Thanks, Kyrie. `
`...You're always the best at cutting away my naivety. `
`...Heheheh, ...hehhahahahahahah! `
`Hyahhhahahahahahahahahaahahahaha!!!" `
`Rudolf's evil laugh rang out. `
`The laugh was so purely evil, it was almost soothing. `
`Hypocritical evil that still contains some pangs of conscience is far more repulsive to behold. `
`If a man's committed to doing great evil anyway, how much more pleasant and gallant it is when he's wholly devoted to his goal. `
`In that sense, Rudolf's evil smile and laugh... `
`were pleasant and gallant indeed... `
`Which means... `
`The brutal, bloody stage of the dining hall...must have been soothing as well. `
`A clang. `
`A thud. `
`A crack, a squish. `
`...A strange mixture of these sounds kept repeating over and over at the same tempo. `
`...Each time, a red splash landed on the tablecloth dangling nearby. `
`"Jessica-chan, ......can you hear me...?" `
`Kyrie asked this with the sort of smile any aunt might make to her niece. `
`However, Jessica didn't answer. `
`There was nothing particularly surprising about this. `
`...After all, by now, `
`...her nose had been broken, `
`her eyes had been smashed, `
`...her teeth had been knocked out, `
`and not only her nose, but her entire face was now hardly recognizable as a face, `
`...just a lump of bloody flesh... `
`Kyrie finally stopped her task of repeatedly smashing Jessica's face with the stock of her gun. `
`Still sitting on top of Jessica, she tossed her gun to the side, ...pulled a compact out of her pocket, and looked at her own face in the mirror. `
`Then, finally, ...she realized that her face was covered by speckles of fresh blood. `
`"How terrible. `
`These clothes will have to go too. `
`...*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!" `
`With a muffled laugh, Kyrie shakily rose to her feet. `
`Jessica wasn't moving anymore. `
`...She had been convulsing a bit until a second ago, but now, she was as still as stone. `
`"...Smashing a woman's face `
`is nothing new to your aunt, okay? `
`Sorry about that. `
`...If you hadn't resisted, I could've given you a much cleaner death." `
`Kyrie pulled the tablecloth off and used it like a towel to wipe the blood from all over her body. `
`However, instead of taking the blood off, it just smeared it around... `
`and did nothing to remove the stench of blood and death that covered her. `
`When she got tired of rubbing the tablecloth against the blood, Kyrie walked over to the extension line telephone in the corner of the room. `
`Then, she dialed the number for the cousin room in the guesthouse... `
`"......Hello. `
`It's me. `
`...It's your turn now, Battler-kun. `
`Go to the spot in front of the chapel, please. `
`......Yes, that's right. `
`I haven't been given any instructions for Maria-chan. `
`Have her wait there. `
`......*giggle* `
`Yes, keep your wits about you. `
`...I'm rooting for you to be chosen as the Successor, Battler-kun." `
`With the same smile as usual and the partly-wiped splashes of blood still covering her face, ...Kyrie finished her call to Battler. `
`When she set down the receiver, there was a small knock, and Rudolf came back into the room. `
`"...Hey, you look like shit." `
`"Jessica-chan has better reflexes than I gave her credit for. `
`I didn't think she'd be able to fight back from a situation like that." `
`"It's a bit of a shame she had to end up looking like this. `
`...What a waste of a good, Natsuhi-esque woman." `
`"And how about your end? `
`Did he give you much trouble?" `
`"No problems there. `
`Plain and simple." `
`When Kyrie heard Rudolf's instant response, she favored him with an evil smile. `
`Yes, the man she loved was the sort who could do it if he tried, without letting cheap emotions get in the way... `
`"I love you, Rudolf-san. `
`I wouldn't have it any other way." `
`"It's hard to imagine an easier job to net you a billion yen. `
`...It's like Dad always said. `
`In the life of every man, there comes one day when he has to be willing to kill." `
`"In other words, always be determined to survive, even if you have to kill to do it. `
`...That's my favorite line of his." `
`"What's next? `
`My rifle is hungry for blood." `
`"You've got a big job coming up. `
`Convincing Battler-kun." `
`"Ah, that's right. `
`That'll be a pain. `
`Hope I don't have to end it by pulling the trigger." `
`"I've really enjoyed `
`life as a three-person family with Ange. `
`...But, if you really want Battler-kun to join in on that, ...give it your best." `
`"Sure. `
`...I'll make sure we don't have any complaints from him. `
`Don't worry, I've worked out a scenario to trick him good." `
`"Good luck. `
`Even I hope that Ange's beloved big brother doesn't get caught up in the explosion accident." `
`"I know. `
`Then, I'll head back to the chapel." `
`"Rudolf-san." `
`"What...?" `
`"......If you can't convince Battler-kun..." `
`"...... `
`...I know, I know. `
`If that happens, bang." `
`"Battler-kun is independent enough that he left the family out of protest when I married you, remember? `
`...If you can only convince him halfway, and if things get nasty later on, `
`...he'll prove fatal to us." `
`"I know. `
`Believe in me." `
`"...And if... `
`If I decide that Battler-kun is growing suspicious, `
`...I'll kill him myself. `
`He's not my kid, after all." `
`"...Yeah, `
`I know. `
`...So, `
`promise me one thing, Kyrie." `
`"What's that...?" `
`"If...I can trick Battler, and the three of us make it off this island..." `
`"...If that happens, what?" `
`"...... `
`...Never say that Battler isn't your kid again. `
`...After all, ...you're his mother. `
`...Please." `
`"...... `
`...Sure, I promise." `
`Kyrie shrugged and answered as she loaded bullets. `
`"You go to the chapel. `
`I'll wait until Battler-kun has left, and then clean up everything inside the guesthouse." `
`"Are you sure you'll be okay doing that alone?" `
`"That's my line." `
`Battler left the guesthouse under an umbrella. `
`He had been called to the area in front of the chapel, just like George had been. `
`Not even 30 minutes had passed since the time George and Jessica had been called out. `
`...Apparently, this test didn't last too long. `
`"...Damn geezer. `
`First you never come out, not even for lunch, and then you show up in the middle of the night with a test. `
`...I'll bet living as a shut-in's got his sense of day and night all backwards." `
`Complaining all the way, Battler strolled off into the rain. `
`Almost immediately, he was swallowed up by the darkness of the rose garden and passed out of sight... `
`......And then... `
`Kyrie could be seen coming out from the darkness of the rose garden. `
`Her right hand held a gun. `
`Her left an umbrella. `
`Her inner pocket contained the master key ring she had stolen from Gohda. `
`Her right pocket had a handful of bullets. `
`Her left held a knife she had taken from the kitchen. `
`She was a carefully and perfectly outfitted murderer. `
`Another bolt of lightning struck down from the swirling skies. `
`It lit up only half of Kyrie's face. `
`Her cheek...was still covered with Jessica's blood... `
`Under the eaves, Kyrie folded up her umbrella, smiled, and spoke to no one. `
`"Hey everyone, I'm home." `
`Rudolf could be seen under the eaves of the chapel. `
`He had hidden his gun in the nearby shadows and was now smoking a cigarette... `
`"...Should be easy to trick that dimwit. `
`...And if it doesn't work, that's just too bad." `
`He glanced over at the place he had stowed his gun. `
`The cigarette smoke began to pleasantly cloud his mind. `
`...Battler isn't a kid anymore. `
`He's an adult, who can choose his path through life as he pleases. `
`When animals grow up, it's normal for them to form a group and go on a journey. `
`Humans are the only ones that keep treating their young like kids even after they get big... `
`"...If I'd known it'd come to this, `
`I never would've begged for you to come back. `
`...I regret...dragging you back into the family..." `
`He puffed out those words... `
`...along with the smoke. `
`When Battler came, he didn't intend to voice those regrets of his. `
`Rudolf was already determined to play the part of the evil murderer who kills for money... `
`"...He's still not here. `
`...What's taking him so long?" `
`At that moment, he heard the sound of someone stepping on gravel. `
`He looked up, thinking that Battler had finally arrived, ...but the sound had come from the direction opposite of the mansion. `
`"............!" `
`"...Rudolf... `
`...How could you... `
`do that...to my husband...?!!" `
`"Aneki... So, you're alive..." `
`"Sorry that I'm alive! `
`Too bad! `
`But my husband wasn't so lucky... `
`How could you... `
`How could you...?!!"`
`With a face obscured by anger and tears, Eva slowly walked closer, her gun raised. `
`Her husband had been killed right in front of her. `
`She probably wouldn't even hesitate. `
`Realizing that a gun, quivering with anger, was pointed right at his chest, Rudolf backed away. `
`As he pretended to retreat, ...he approached the gun he had hidden in the shadows. `
`"C-Calm down, Aneki... `
`Put the gun down... `
`...I never wanted that to happen. `
`Everything happened so fast. There was nothing I could do...!" `
`"How can you tell such half-baked lies?!!" `
`As Eva had said, it really had been a half-baked, pointless thing to say. `
`Rudolf would have said anything if he thought it would calm Eva's emotions before she pulled the trigger, which she looked capable of doing at any moment now... `
`...Then, Rudolf's foot came in contact with his gun. `
`"L-Let's just talk this over. `
`...George-kun should be here soon. `
`...Oh. `
`...Hey, George-kun, we're over here." `
`Rudolf waved, as though George was coming from behind Eva. `
`Let Eva's attention turn in that direction... `
`...That idiot. `
`My simple, big sister has always been a sucker. `
`Die!!! `
`Gunfire. `
`...Then, a bit later, the sound of something heavier than rain drip-dropping onto the cobblestone. `
`"......Agh, `
`......nggg..." `
`"...Rudolf... `
`I've always been able to see through your tricks...!!" `
`The bullet Eva fired went straight into Rudolf's chest. `
`The bullet Rudolf fired at Eva missed, landing near her feet. `
`"Guess I was...right... `
`This gun... `
`does shoot `
`low..." `
`He dropped the gun into a puddle with a splash, staggered backwards, and leaned against the wall of the chapel. `
`"Nah, that's not it... `
`...All good westerns end...with the bad guy's bullet missing..." `
`Eva dashed up to him, kicked away the gun that had fallen into a puddle, and grabbed Rudolf by the collar. `
`"What about George?! `
`Where is he?! `
`I won't let you kill him...!!" `
`"......Sorry, Aneki. `
`...Already...got him." `
`"Liar!!" `
`"...Did it in the bushes over there. `
`...Go take a look. `
`You'll see soon..." `
`"......R- `
`Rudolf, `
`...you......" `
`Eva, who claimed to know all of her little brother's tricks, `
`...also knew that Rudolf's final words, as his consciousness began to fade thanks to the bullet wound, were not a lie. `
`"How could you... George, ...Geoooooooooooooooooorrge!!!" `
`An empty shell casing bounced off the cobblestone. `
`The furious gun barrel was pressed against Rudolf's forehead. `
`"...Go ahead and shoot. `
`...I doubt that'll bring you much peace though." `
`A bolt of lightning turned everything white. `
`However, the wall of the chapel was stained blood red. `
`A red splash, like a crushed tomato, came out from the back of Rudolf's head and covered the wall... `
`Then, leaving a red trail behind him, `
`...Rudolf sagged downwards, `
`sat on the ground, and fell over. `
`"George, Geooooooooorge!! `
`Geooooooooorge, uwaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!" `
`Eva dashed off towards the bushes. `
`...She found George's corpse almost immediately, screamed, and broke down sobbing. `
`...Rudolf's bloody corpse was exposed to the rain that ran down off the eaves. `
`His eyes were still wide open. `
`A fist-sized, flesh-covered hole was open in the back of his head, ...and his insides were exposed to the open air. `
`Inside was a mixed jelly of flesh, brains, and spinal fluid. `
`That goop, which looked like someone had mixed it up with a spoon, dripped from his eyes, nose, ears, mouth, and the hole in his head... `
`"...Dad, ...Dad... `
`...Aaaaaaaaahhh...!!!" `
`Ange clutched at her head, sobbing and moaning. `
`Her father had dirtied his hands with murder over money, and on top of that, he had faced such a cruel end, and Ange had been forced to see his corpse. `
`It was hard to imagine a more painful experience for a daughter to go through. `
`...I'm totally fed up with this. It's completely meaningless. `
`"Bernkastel-san...! `
`I know you're here somewhere! `
`Please, make this game stop...!! `
`There's no point to it!" `
`As if in answer to that yell, ...a black shadow appeared a few seats in front of them. `
`Or perhaps she was sitting there the whole time. `
`Maybe we just couldn't see her until we were aware of her. `
`It was, without a doubt, the back of Bernkastel's head. `
`"Bernkastel-san...!!" `
`"...Pipe down back there. `
`Can't you watch the show quietly?" `
`The witch turned around with bored eyes. `
`...As though the two people yelling were the strange ones. `
`"Please stop this...! `
`We realize that this is the sealed cat box world of October 4th and 5th...!" `
`The games are like messages. `
`Or maybe more like a roundabout love letter. `
`A single message can be conveyed over several games. `
`But now, we understand. `
`We know that endless tales can seep out of the sealed, two-day cat box. `
`And beyond that, I even know the culprit and the motive. `
`That has already been revealed, and it doesn't even have anything to do with this game. `
`"We both know the answer, that this is a cat box tale...! `
`So, there shouldn't be any need for any further games...!! `
`If this is supposed to be a game between you and us, then we already know the answer...!! `
`The game should be over!!" `
`"Just shut up already. `
`Didn't you hear Bern tell you to be quiet?" `
`Another shadow appeared in the next seat over, turned around, and scolded the pair. `
`"......There is a point. `
`If you just watch, you'll see it. `
`...*giggle*giggle*." `
`"Are you the Game Master...?!" `
`"...Not at all." `
`"Then who is it?! `
`Could it be...Clair...?" `
`"If you watch, you'll see. `
`Not much longer now. `
`...*giggle*giggle*." `
`"The tragedy has already reached its climax. `
`Who'll survive, I wonder? `
`Heheheheheheheheh..." `
`Bernkastel isn't the Game Master...? `
`Then who is? `
`Could Clair have created this cruel tale...? `
`Or are there even more witches playing around with this cat box...? `
`The guesthouse...was wrapped in silence. `
`There were no sounds. `
`No trace of anyone's presence. `
`No breathing from anyone alive. `
`There wasn't anything to be heard anymore... `
`If anything could be heard... `
`...It was the sound of the murderer's feet stepping across the floor... `
`Kyrie slowly passed through the lounge. `
`In her right hand...was a gun. `
`In her left hand...was a knife. `
`The knife was stained with blood, and some was still dripping from the tip, `
`...leaving behind red tracks like a demon's footprints... `
`Her hands were filled with tools of murder. `
`So, she wasn't capable of doing anything but murder. `
`In that sense, at that moment, she was clearly and purely a murderer. `
`...The murderer went to the entrance hall, and then, only after reaching the front door, looked down to see the two bloodstained hands of a killer. `
`Those hands gripped the tools of death that had performed a cruel massacre. `
`Then, at last, the murderer realized that it wouldn't even be possible to open the door like this...and tossed aside the knife... `
`Then, the murderer reached out to the door, turned around calmly, ...and spoke. `
`"Sorry, everyone. `
`...But don't worry. `
`A few days later, the newspapers will be talking about an unfortunate accident. `
`...And I'm sure the news shows, the papers, and rumormongers everywhere will be sure that you spent your time in happy ignorance until the instant of the accident. `
`...In other words, you'll all have had a good time until midnight on October 5th." `
`So said the one who had stained that bloody guesthouse red. `
`"At this hour, the cousins are all staying up late and playing around. `
`...And the servants who have to get up early are all snoring. `
`The ones on the late shift are probably filling in the log or taking a break about now." `
`"...That's how it is. `
`From where I am now, I can hear laughter coming from the cousin room. `
`......*giggle*." `
`Humans outside the cat box would probably never understand what Kyrie was saying. `
`Only she, shut inside the cat box of the explosion accident, could know what it really meant... `
`Outside, the rain poured down heavily. `
`Kyrie almost picked up an umbrella, but then stopped suddenly, as if she'd just thought of something. `
`Then, she started walking out into the rain, not caring at all whether she got wet or not... `
`Did the murderer not want an umbrella to get in the way of her gun? `
`...Or was she hoping that the rain could act as a shower to get the blood off her? `
`"............" `
`Kyrie stopped walking. `
`As though something unexpected had caught her attention. `
`However, this time, it was no whim of hers... `
`"......How could you... `
`...kill my husband...?!!!" `
`"Oh, `
`...Eva nee-san. `
`...That's surprising. `
`How could I have missed you from that distance?" `
`"I'm just as surprised. `
`I didn't think I'd survive." `
`"...You came here from the underground stairway behind the chapel, right? `
`...In that case-" `
`"That's right. `
`I bumped into Rudolf in front of the chapel!" `
`"And how was he doing?" `
`"Oh, just wonderful. `
`We managed to have a friendly sibling chat for the first time in a while." `
`"...... `
`...I see. `
`...He's such a show-off, but so unreliable in a tight spot. `
`...Looks like he can't do anything without me after all." `
`After that short exchange of words, Kyrie already knew that Rudolf had been killed. `
`However, no trace of urgency or panic rose to her face. `
`She just closed her eyes with her usual unconcerned expression, `
`...and when she opened them again, she had regained her composed smile. `
`"...Thank you. `
`I'm grateful. `
`This way, I really can have everything to myself." `
`"What's that blood on your clothes...? `
`You just came out of the guesthouse, didn't you...? `
`...Don't tell me..." `
`"Yes, that's right. `
`...I'm right in the middle of a murder case at the moment." `
`"You killed them?! `
`All of them?!! `
`Even Maria-chan...?!" `
`"There was no need to let them live until morning. `
`When morning came, there would be an uproar, and that could be a pain. `
`They might've used a radio to contact someone off the island and gotten help. `
`...So, this was clearly the optimal move to take. `
`If you spin the chessboard around and look at it that way, right...?" `
`"Monster!! `
`I can't believe you could be so blinded by greed that you'd commit murder...!!" `
`"You weren't doing so bad yourself." `
`"That was an accident!! `
`I didn't mean to kill them! `
`Unlike you!!" `
`"No, just like me. `
`...If that gun hadn't gone off, you would've kept on arguing and jumping at each other. `
`Then, the rest of you would've eventually reached the same answer as me, just a few steps slower." `
`"I'm not a murderer!!" `
`"Not true. `
`You're just a murderer who didn't get a chance. `
`You've just been saved by that accidental discharge. `
`......If it weren't for that bit of good luck, and if I hadn't moved before you did, `
`...then you would've played the same role I'm playing now. `
`That fact won't go away, no matter how much you try to deny it. It's the truth of a different future." `
`"D-Don't try and confuse me!" `
`However, ...on the inside, Eva understood. `
`Back then, she had probably been saved by that accidental discharge, by a coincidence. `
`If the argument had continued much longer, she would surely have grown a desire to kill Krauss and the others, and might even have carried it out. `
`...She simply could not deny the existence of that demon deep within her heart. `
`Only the theatergoers knew. `
`They knew that she could become a killer in another world. `
`Kyrie, who didn't have the theatergoing ability, knew this fact as well. `
`...Maybe there really was something extraordinary about her after all. `
`So, for some time, Eva could only grind her teeth in silence, still pointing her gun... `
`"...I don't understand. `
`You're also a mother. You've felt the pain of giving birth to your own child. `
`How can you not know how precious a life is...?! `
`How are you capable of doing all this...?!" `
`"That's the thing about kids. If you just sleep around, they get made all by themselves." `
`"That's not what I'm talking about...!!" `
`"They say that children are bonds, right?" `
`"What?!" `
`"Children are bonds used to tie you to your husband. `
`...She was a bond to make Rudolf-san acknowledge me, so I could take him back from that woman." `
`"But you've killed Rudolf-san now. `
`...You understand what that means, right?" `
`"What do you mean, `
`...I understand?!" `
`"Just that right now, `
`I'm the wife of no man, and I have no intention of being a mother. `
`...I am me. `
`Kyrie. `
`Now that Rudolf-san's dead, I'm not even an Ushiromiya anymore. `
`I live to benefit me." `
`"Right, Rudolf is dead, so maybe you aren't a wife anymore. `
`But you still have Ange-chan, don't you...?! `
`You're still a mother, aren't you...?!" `
`"Didn't you hear what I just said about bonds? `
`Now that Rudolf-san is gone, Ange is of no use to me." `
`"...Y- `
`You, `
`...how can any mother say that about her own daughter?!" `
`"Eva nee-san, `
`let's put a stop to this. `
`We can be honest here." `
`"Honest...?!" `
`"Did either of us marry because we wanted children? `
`We didn't, right? `
`We married because we wanted to live with the man we loved. `
`And, once you've married, you never want to let that man go, for the rest of your life, correct? `
`Children are just weapons to be used for that goal." `
`"I'd never have children for a reason like that...!!" `
`"But people can have children for just that reason." `
`Kyrie kept on speaking emotionlessly, ignoring the falling rain... `
`Her relaxed smile didn't falter for an instant. `
`"Ange was just a chain I used to tie Rudolf-san to me. `
`...Or, you could call her a chess piece, someone to play the role of the kid in our family drama. `
`...To me, Ange was nothing more than a piece, necessary so that I could act the part of the good mother in front of Rudolf-san." `
`"...You... ...Could you say that to Ange-chan's face?!" `
`"That would be just a bit too sad, so I won't say it to her directly. `
`I plan to write her a letter asking her to forgive her bad mother, then vanish from her life. `
`You've seen what Rosa-san and Maria-chan are like, right? `
`Now that Rudolf-san's gone, Ange's just a chain tying me down." `
`"...I'll go back to being just Kyrie, and enjoy the rest of my life at my leisure. `
`A new challenge, and a new life. `
`And maybe even a new love. `
`*giggle*......" `
`"...And you call yourself human... `
`...You call yourself Ange-chan's mother?!" `
`"*giggle*giggle* `
`Who gives a damn about Ange? `
`I've never liked `
`that little brat." `
`"...H-How can you..." `
`"You've been released from your family drama too, haven't you? `
`Let's sing the praises of a woman's freedom. `
`You should thank me for having George-kun killed for you too." `
`"...Y-You...monsteeeeeeeeeer!!" `
`"Ahhahhahahahahhaaahhhyahhahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!" `
`The two yells...and the sound of gunfire...thundered across the dark rose garden. `
`...Slowly, Eva fell backwards. `
`Then, she landed in a puddle, ...scattering countless drops of water. `
`Across from her, Kyrie spun around as though dancing. `
`Beautiful, black rose petals scattered around her. `
`The petals...were a dark, dark red. `
`...As they sprayed from her throat, she spun around in a circle, `
`...and slowly crumpled. `
`Then, she fell to the ground, sending muddy water flying. `
`The two women had shot...and fallen...... `
`However, when the thunder roared, only Eva sat back up... `
`"......*pant*... `
`...*pant*... `
`...*pant*..." `
`Eva hadn't been shot. `
`Kyrie's intensity had made her fall backwards, ...but the bullet had once again slipped right past her... `
`Eva cursed her good luck. `
`Why couldn't this luck have saved her husband or her son? `
`"......Die there, ...for Ange-chan's sake as well. `
`......You'll be killed in the explosion accident. `
`Until the moment of your death, you worried about the daughter you left behind. `
`...Yes. `
`I'll write that into the lid of the cat box......" `
`"..............." `
`When Kyrie heard this, ...blood dripped from her grinning mouth, and she seemed to say something in response. `
`However, her voice came out only as globs of blood from the hole in her throat, not words... `
`"M... `
`Mom... `
`...Mom, `
`uwaaaaaaaaahhhhhh...! `
`It's... `
`a lie... `
`...It's all a lie...!! `
`Aaaaaaagggghhhhhh...!!" `
`"Ange, ...please, calm down...! `
`This is just a game...! `
`That couldn't possibly be what your mother truly feels...! `
`It's just something that the Game Master made Aunt Kyrie's piece say...!!" `
`But saying that did nothing to calm Ange's sobs. `
`I don't blame her. `
`Even if she knows it's just a game, ...she's been forced to see, not only her mother's death, `
`...but also her mother announcing that she was the culprit of a mass murder, who didn't even love her own daughter. `
`Anyone would sob after hearing that... `
`"Bernkastel-san!! `
`Enough of this!! `
`I don't care who the Game Master is!! `
`Stop this pointless game right now!!" `
`When Lion yelled this, the theater suddenly went pitch-black, swallowed in darkness. `
`However, that wasn't enough to shock Lion. `
`Lion continued to yell Bernkastel's name into the darkness, telling the witch to stop this game. `
`Then, a single beam of light shone down upon the stage. `
`There was Clair, the one who had appeared for just a second right before this cruel game began. `
`"Clair...!! `
`So, ...you were the Game Master after all?! `
`...I don't get it. Why?!" `
`Clair didn't answer. `
`...In fact, ...it looked as though she hadn't even heard. `
`Her eyes were blank, and you couldn't tell what she was looking at. `
`In fact, she was even forgetting to blink... `
`...She looked...just like a doll... `
`Then, another beam of light lit up the side of the stage. `
`Beneath that light...stood Bernkastel. `
`At the same moment, though there appeared to be no one in the audience, a thunderous applause rang out... `
`"......*giggle*." `
`Bernkastel raised her right hand in response to the applause. `
`She kept doing so until it died down... `
`"Bernkastel-san!! `
`So, ...you were the Master of this game after all...!!" `
`"...Lion, `
`how many times do I have to tell you that I'm not the Game Master?" `
`"Then are you saying it's Clair?! `
`That's impossible...!!" `
`"Yep. `
`Of course it's impossible. `
`After all, `
`Clair died. `
`...We were just conducting her funeral. `
`Did you forget that...?" `
`"Then just who is standing there...?" `
`"A corpse. `
`She's not a mannequin. `
`So, of course, she still has her insides. `
`...She's hiding it under a beautiful exterior, but she's actually packed full of guts." `
`When Bernkastel raised her right hand, ...a light fell on it, and a black, shining scythe appeared there. `
`It was a cold, merciless, and cruel object, like something a classic grim reaper might hold. `
`"...Wh-What are you planning to do...?" `
`"...When they're alive, you can enjoy watching them struggle. `
`When they're dead, you can enjoy tearing out their guts. `
`Tales are things you get to enjoy twice. `
`...That's what it means to be a witch of theatergoing." `
`Bernkastel pressed the blade of her reaper's scythe against Clair's stomach... `
`and slowly slid it across. `
`Then, along the line she traced, Clair's dress was sliced open. `
`It was now clear that the scythe she held was not a fake one for theatrical use. `
`...And, it was clear just what she planned to do next that made her cruel smile so fitting. `
`"Ange, `
`can you hear me?" `
`"......I hear you... `
`You tear me to bits, make me read! `
`What's next?! `
`Are you showing me this worst possible tale to hurt me even more?! `
`Is this fun for you?! `
`Yeah, I'll bet it is. `
`I had a blast too...! `
`You think...that I'd give up after that?! `
`You think...I'll sit around crying any longer because of that disgusting game of yours?!!" `
`"...Both you and Lion... `
`seem to have the wrong idea. `
`I'm not the Game Master. `
`This tale is not one that I created." `
`"Then that woman in the dress is the Game Master?!" `
`"No, she isn't...! `
`That can't be! `
`Then who is the Game Master?! `
`Who wove this disgusting tale?!!" `
`"You still don't understand?" `
`"What don't we understand?!!" `
`"Ange, `
`you gambled everything on a faint chance of a miracle, throwing yourself forward. `
`...I invited you to October 4th and 5th of 1986 out of respect for your courage." `
`"...What was your goal? `
`To take your family back. `
`...That would be a very difficult thing, and without the blessing of a miracle, a thoroughly impossible one. `
`You were prepared for that, weren't you?" `
`"Yes, I'm prepared...!! `
`And I still haven't given up on Onii-chan, Mom, and Dad!" `
`"Whether you give up or not is your choice. `
`That's your own game, after all. `
`I won't support you, and I won't even watch. `
`I've already enjoyed my fill of games that use the piece you are, so I have no need for you any longer." `
`"Glad to hear it. `
`Then why am I here? `
`Aren't you the one who invited me?!" `
`"Yes, that's right. `
`I invited you here. `
`...To thank you for entertaining me for a while, as my piece." `
`"To thank me?! `
`Hah, so this is how witches show gratitude!! `
`Sure, this has been loads of fun, you beast! `
`How could you make this kind... `
`this kind of game... `
`and do that to Dad and Mom?!!" `
`"Ange, `
`you made a wish, hoping to take your family back. `
`However, you also made another wish. `
`Remember?" `
`"No, I don't!!" `
`"You wanted to know what happened on that day." `
`What happened on Rokkenjima on October 4th and 5th, 1986? `
`Didn't Ange leave on her journey with Amakusa because she longed to answer that question? `
`"That's right... `
`So what's your point?!" `
`"...You don't...mean..." `
`Lion realized what Bernkastel was getting at. `
`Realized...and was unable to say any more... `
`The Game Master is neither Bernkastel nor Clair. `
`Then who is it...? `
`That's the wrong question. `
`There is...no Game Master. `
`That could mean only one thing... `
`"Ange, `
`you still don't understand?" `
`"...What...?" `
`"This is the truth. `
`The insides of the cat box of October 4th and 5th, 1986. `
`Afterwards, Eva survived the explosion by escaping to Kuwadorian. `
`...And, since she never spoke of the inside of the cat box no matter how much you wanted to know, that truth was shut within the cat box for all eternity." `
`"What...are you saying...?" `
`"Only Eva returned alive. `
`Even though the police claimed it was an accident, the public didn't believe it. `
`Then, she took over her husband's company, and the harder she worked to make it more and more successful, the more enemies she made. `
`A public image of her as a great queen of conspiracy grew stronger and stronger." `
`"...I'm sure she wanted to tell people about the truth. `
`That truth that no one would ever believe without proof. `
`...Bit by bit, Eva's heart began to snap. `
`You rejected Eva, so she rejected you in turn. `
`The relationship between the last two members of your family was strained to the limit. `
`Each time she compared you with her beloved son, she grew more and more twisted and broken." `
`Then, a strange message bottle was picked up and became a topic of conversation. `
`It contained a bizarre story, one that told of a mysterious serial murder connected to Rokkenjima's gold. `
`Everyone rejected the explosion accident theory and started to think up conspiracy theories. `
`Some of those theories named Eva as the culprit, which tormented her even more. `
`However, Eva used even that...to build up the cat box. `
`And until the moment of her death, she protected it. `
`She protected the lock that held the cat box shut. `
`So, no Human would ever reach the truth inside the cat box. `
`Not unless those witches who cross the sea of Fragments opened the lock... `
`"This is the truth." `
`"......You're lying... `
`...You're lying, ...lying...!! `
`If this really is the truth, you should be able to say so in red!! `
`There's no way you can, of course there isn't!! `
`Nngyyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!" `
`"Ange...!! `
`Ange, calm down...!! `
`Uu, ...ah...?!" `
`Ange writhed with such strength that the chains on her arms and legs looked like they might snap. `
`All over her body, ...a red, gooey liquid started to seep out. `
`It was as though cracks had opened up all over her and blood was leaking out of all of them. `
`"What's that? `
`You want me to announce it clearly with the red truth? `
`Then I'll say it just for you. `
`{a:c: `
`{p:1:That this is all truth} `
`} `
`{a:c: `
`"Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!" `
`} `
`Ange's yell covered up Bern's red truth. `
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*, `
`ahhahahahahahahahahaha...!! `
`Stupid kid. `
`If only you hadn't made me say that, you could've shut it up inside the cat box. `
`But you just had to ask, right? `
`I knew you would, of course. `
`And I so wanted to see you scream like that. `
`...A lovely expression like that should keep me laughing for about a hundred years. `
`...*giggle*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!! `
`Go back to being scrap meat. `
`Ahhahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!" `
`"Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh, gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!! `
`Mom, Dad, `
`...it's a lie, right?! `
`Lies, `
`...lies... `
`...gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh......" `
`"A-Ange...! `
`Ange...?!" `
`As Ange held her head and screamed, the blood dripping from her finally grew so thick that it started scattering all over the place. `
`Then, bit by bit, her body began to melt...no, to fall apart. `
`Then, bits of her began to pile up on the chair, ...until she was nothing but a pile of guts and scraps... `
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahahahah, aaaahhahahahahaaaaahhaahaha!! `
`Is the truth really that sacred? `
`How absurd, how foolish!! `
`Why can't Humans control their own truth? `
`They stupidly search for the truth like that's all that matters, and when they finally find it and can't stand it, they turn themselves into scrap meat!!" `
`"Hey, are you watching? `
`Clair? `
`......You wanted to hide this truth too, didn't you? `
`For fun, you wrote several cat box tales... `
`and planned to seal them in message bottles like the end of a mystery novel you loved. `
`Then, you threw them into the sea. `
`To save those who would suffer if they knew this truth...!!" `
`"You sealed everything in a cat box, and Eva provided the lock. `
`*giggle*giggle*!! `
`And I've sliced that box open for you...!! `
`Ahhahahahahahahahahaha, `
`all that effort you spent to hide it has gone to waste!! `
`I've exposed all of the truth you hid with your death!! `
`Ahhahahahahahhahhahhahhahha!!" `
`"Is that...what you've been after?! `
`You did all of this just to mock Clair's death?!! `
`And then, ...you showed it to Ange to make her suffer...?! `
`You really were...an evil witch after all!!" `
`"I've been a witch the whole time. `
`A traveler whose only goal is to escape boredom. `
`...Care for it and love it while it's alive, then eat the guts when it's dead. `
`That's how witches live!" `
`"I cannot forgive you for what you've done...!! `
`You've hurt Ange and humiliated Clair, ...the person I would become in another world...!! `
`I won't forgive you...!!" `
`"Lion, `
`you're still Clair's hope. `
`Even after her death." `
`"............!" `
`"From the moment Clair got thrown off that cliff, her fate was already sealed. `
`I'm sure she felt a little bit of salvation `
`to know that another "her" lives in happiness in another world." `
`"...That's right. `
`I'm her salvation...! `
`So, I must live life to the fullest...for the both of us...!" `
`"Lion, `
`...let me show you just a bit more of this tale of the truth." `
`"I'm not interested!" `
`"No, it'll be very interesting. `
`...After the duel between Eva and Kyrie, the guesthouse is wrapped in silence. `
`Let me invite you to the parlor at that point in time." `
`"The parlor...? `
`The one in the mansion?" `
`Bernkastel snapped her fingers, and the scene of the mansion's parlor unfolded before them. `
`In the cruel tale they had just been shown, the parlor hadn't been particularly important. `
`Jessica had been summoned to the parlor, but she was then immediately led to the dining hall and killed there. `
`So, there hadn't been anything to see in the parlor. `
`And, in fact, there was nothing to see in the parlor now appearing before Lion. `
`"Just what's supposed to be here?" `
`"*giggle* `
`...As you can see, there's nothing here. `
`But watch. `
`I'm about to show you something interesting." `
`"If you call it interesting, that's a sure sign that it isn't." `
`"*giggle*giggle* `
`...Go on, take a look. `
`...It's right there. `
`Right in that corner." `
`Bernkastel was pointing...at nothing more than a corner of the room. `
`There was nothing there. `
`She had told Lion to look there, so the latter was expecting something terrible to be there, `
`...but there really was nothing there at all. `
`"............??" `
`"...That's right, there's nothing there. `
`At least, not in this world. `
`But what if we peek into the next Fragment over...?" `
`"............?!" `
`On the white, blank wall, `
`...bit `
`by bit, `
`...a splash of blood seeped into view. `
`Then, right there, ...a corpse appeared. `
`But...that couldn't be... `
`"...Th- `
`This is... `
`...m- `
`me...?!" `
`It was Lion, ...lying dead against the wall... `
`Ushiromiya Lion's corpse lay there exposed... `
`"Wh-What's going on here...? `
`Why am I here...? `
`This is supposed to be Clair's world, not mine...! `
`Clair and I can't exist at the same time, right...?!" `
`"Yes, that's right. `
`That's because I just switched worlds, ...switched Fragments. `
`Switched to your world, that is." `
`"...I don't understand!" `
`"It's very simple. `
`They both end the same way. `
`...*giggle*giggle*!!" `
`"I don't get it!! `
`Why should I be dead here?!!" `
`"In your world, `
`on October 4th, 1986, `
`Beatrice's funeral was held just before the family conference." `
`"Yes, I know that. `
`And for me, that happened today, a short while ago!" `
`"I wonder what will happen between that time and late that night..." `
`"Nothing at all!! `
`The cousins will all play together, and the whole family will have dinner together!" `
`"Then comes the family conference after night falls. `
`......You were going to succeed the Headship when you turned 20, right? `
`Was the entire family satisfied with that, I wonder...?" `
`"......I don't know if they were satisfied, but the decision had been made. `
`...The Head made it himself." `
`"Looks like even you don't really believe they were satisfied. `
`That's it right there. `
`...Kinzo adored you more than anything, ...so he tried to make an exception and have you succeed the Headship directly. `
`Of course, his children wouldn't have been happy with that." `
`The siblings objected to having Lion succeed the Headship. `
`Even Krauss joined in, saying that Lion was still too young. `
`Then, on the night of the family conference, Kinzo tried proposing a difficult riddle... `
`"Could it be......?" `
`"That's right. `
`The riddle of the epitaph. `
`......As you can tell by the mechanism set into the chapel, Kinzo thought up the epitaph trick near the beginning, when the mansion on Rokkenjima was being built. `
`...He had the romantic idea of someday using it as a test to select his successor." `
`Kinzo decided to present that riddle at the family conference. `
`Did he plan to give the position of Successor to the person who solved it? `
`Or did he promise to reconsider Lion's position as the Successor if it was solved? `
`Either way, Kinzo was confident. `
`He was confident that no one would be able to solve this tough riddle, which he had created himself. `
`"After that, everything happened exactly like the truth you just saw. `
`The siblings solved it right away, and there was a quarrel over the pile of gold. `
`*giggle*... `
`Then, Kyrie and Rudolf decided to prevent any chance of the crime being discovered the next morning and an outcry being raised... by committing murder late that night. `
`......They used the phone to call the kids out from the cousin room one by one, then killed them." `
`"...As the first of the cousins, you were the first to be called out. `
`Then, Kyrie shot you dead right here in the parlor." `
`"...No, that's not quite right. `
`You're the Ushiromiya Lion from the early evening of October 4th, 1986. `
`So, I'll say it this way. `
`...Tonight, Kyrie will shoot you dead in the parlor." `
`"That's......insane... `
`It's... That's right, probability! `
`Just like Lion can be born from Clair thanks to a rare miracle, `
`Aunt Kyrie only commits murder with a tiny probability, close to zero! That must be it! `
`Aren't you the witch who specializes in finding extremely improbable worlds?!!" `
`"That is correct. `
`I had to find one Fragment out of 2,578,917 in order to discover the miracle that is you. `
`...However, `
`it was very, very easy to find this result for your world. `
`After all, probability isn't a factor. `
`...I'm a witch who can find any miracle, no matter how unlikely it is." `
`"But I can't find things that don't exist. `
`...If the Witch of Certainty really guarantees that something is certain, even I can't win against her." `
`"But... `
`...then... `
`...I'm......" `
`"With a 2,578,916 out of 2,578,917 probability, `
`you live in the world where you're Clair, get toyed with by an inescapable fate, and reach a tragic end. `
`And, with a 1 out of 2,578,917 probability, you live as Ushiromiya Lion... `
`and are killed by Kyrie tonight." `
`"...In other words, your fate...no, the fate the two of you share... traps you in an inescapable dead end, a hell of fate, with a 2,578,917 out of 2,578,917 probability. `
`To put it another way, it's a certain fate, with absolutely no chance for a miracle! `
`*giggle*, eheheheheheheheheheh!! `
`Sucks for you, Clair. `
`Or should I say, Beatrice." `
`Just when a bright light seemed to turn the world white, the scene suddenly changed back to the theater. `
`On the stage, Bernkastel's reaper scythe slid across Clair's stomach as the latter stood absolutely still. `
`A red line was drawn across the white skin, exposed now that the dress had been cut, and black blood began to seep out... `
`"Beatrice. `
`Trapped in that inescapable, certain, locked-away pair of days, you became a witch who could give birth to endless possibilities within that two-day cat box. `
`...In exchange, it was absolutely certain that you would not be saved or rewarded. `
`However, you had a dream. `
`...You dreamed of Ushiromiya Lion. `
`...You consoled yourself with the thought of a miracle world, where you could've lived in happiness without ever becoming Clair!" `
`"......I had to work hard to find Lion. `
`Just as Beato dreamed, Lion's existence is a true miracle. `
`And, at the end of your funeral, I wanted to show you. `
`...To show you that, even with that miracle, you couldn't have escaped from tragedy!!" `
`Through the small crack between the bars of the jail that imprisoned her, `
`the witch called Beatrice dreamed of a world where she might have been happy... `
`However, the space she could see through that crack in the bars... `
`was just another part of the same jail... `
`"The more I hear, ...the less I understand about you...! `
`Why...would you do something like this...?!" `
`"I lost a game to Beatrice, so I wanted to get back at her. `
`...*giggle*giggle*!! `
`Yeah, now I feel a lot better about losing that game...! `
`Hey, Beato, are you watching? `
`Can you see this?! `
`And do you remember? `
`Remember when I promised you that a miracle wouldn't occur, with certainty?!" `
`"Ahhahahahahahahah, ahhahahahahaahahahahahahahaha!! `
`So, Lion! `
`Allow me to return you to your world, right before Beato's eyes!! `
`It looks like the theatergoing witches are all sick and tired of those happy family get-together scenes. `
`So, I'll send you to the moment just before Kyrie shoots you! `
`Then, I'll make Beato watch that moment!!" `
`"Ahhahahahahahhahhahhahaha!! `
`Die, scum Lion! `
`The last hope of that scum Beato, uhyahhahhyaahhaaaaaaaaahhh!!!" `
`Bernkastel raised her reaper scythe, `
`...swung it down with gusto, `
`...and plunged it deep into Clair's stomach... `
`"Did you think you'd get an easy death? `
`Hehihihihihihihi!! `
`But humiliating and tearing out a corpse's guts is my specialty...!!" `
`She took the blade end of the scythe and heartlessly, ruthlessly, brutally...raised it up into the air. `
`...Along a vertical line from Clair's stomach to her chest, `
`...the blade cut deeply, `
`...slicing Clair open. `
`The red-black insides... `
`jutted out, `
`...then burst like a dam breaking, covering the world with dark red entrails... `
`"S-Steal the Italians' gold, you say? `
`You coward, Ushiromiya! And you call yourself a soldier of the Empire?!!" `
`"...F-Father...? `
`I-I do love and respect you, Father... `
`B-But...your feelings are something I, ummm..." `
`"Why...?!! `
`Why did you save me?! `
`Why didn't you let me die?! `
`Because of that terrible injury, ...I've been forced to live in a body like this!! `
`I never wanted to live in a body like this!! `
`This body that isn't even capable of love...!! `
`What's...what's the point in living like that?! `
`This isn't a Human's life...!! `
`It's like being furniture!!" `
`"That's right, I'm...furniture...!! `
`Furniture...!! `
`Why...why didn't you let me die back then?!! `
`Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh...!!!" `
`"......Huh-" `
`When I came to, `
`...I was in the parlor of the mansion. `
`When did I get here? `
`...I heard a sound behind me, then slowly turned around... `
`And there...... `
`"Sorry. Please don't take this personally." `
`"......Huh-" `
`I could see down the frigid barrel of the gun Aunt Kyrie was pointing. `
`Then, `
`...she slowly... `
`...pulled the trigger... `
`I could feel a razor-sharp wind pass through my body, like a knife slicing through butter. `
`...Prepared for death, and hoping to see my fate until the end, I slowly opened my eyes... `
`...The world had been cut in two. `
`Kyrie was frozen in place like a statue, still pointing her gun with a cold smile on her face... `
`...and had been cut in half at an angle, the top part of her slowly sliding off to the side. `
`No, that wasn't quite right. `
`That wasn't right at all. `
`It wasn't just Kyrie. `
`The whole world had been sliced in half at an angle...and was slowly sliding off to one side. `
`Then, immediately after fissures seemed to appear across the world, it shattered. `
`"......?! `
`...Y-You...!" `
`"...When you own a cat, you tend to pick up their habits." `
`He pointed at Bernkastel with the tip of the pitch-black sword that had sliced the world, glaring at her. `
`"*giggle*giggle*... `
`...What's this? `
`Are you saying you came back here on a whim...?" `
`"...There was no way you'd end things on a happy note. `
`Do you really hate Beatrice so much?" `
`"You think I'd let her win and get away...? `
`I have to pay her back in full for the humiliation she caused me. `
`When I hold a grudge, a mere century isn't long enough for me to forget it." `
`"You're a gloomy person." `
`"Come on, you mustn't neglect my heart. `
`...*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!" `
`"Are you okay, Lion? `
`......Hey, what's wrong?!" `
`Lion had suddenly doubled over, groaning. `
`"......My chest... `
`...hurts... `
`...It's..." `
`Will roughly grabbed the hand that was pressed against Lion's chest and tore it away. `
`Blood was seeping out from where Lion's hand had been. `
`...It was the place that the bullet would have entered if Kyrie had shot Lion. `
`"*giggle* `
`...Looks like Lion's body `
`is almost ready to accept its fate." `
`"Lion, hang in there! `
`...Damn these chains...!" `
`When Will tried to pick Lion's body up, he finally noticed the chains attached to each wrist and ankle. `
`"What's this? `
`Are you trying to take that kid and escape? `
`I won't let you. `
`I'm about to let everyone watch as Lion coughs up blood, despairing at the fact that there's no hope in any of the many worlds, `
`before finally dying in agony." `
`"Lion isn't a show." `
`Will swung his pitch-black sword and destroyed the chains binding Lion. `
`The chains and shackles shattered into little bits like glass, ...then vanished. `
`"You intend to get in the way of my fun...?" `
`"You aren't God. `
`All you can do is sneer at fate. `
`...Lion's fate is gonna be decided by Lion. `
`You can't treat a human's fate like a toy." `
`"......*giggle*giggle* `
`Hahhahahhahahahahahahahaha...!! `
`You've got guts, saying that to the great Bernkastel, witch of the Senate! `
`I have no more use for you either, get it...?" `
`"You've shown that Beato's fantasy is a mystery and cut it to pieces. `
`You've fulfilled your role. `
`I would've let you be, if only you'd just left quietly. `
`Now that you've strolled back in here, you can hardly complain if I make you my plaything." `
`"Come to me, my cute kitties. `
`...Scratch them up and tear off their skin. `
`Peel them like grapes...!" `
`When Bernkastel clapped her hands twice, countless pairs of glaring jewels appeared all around Will and Lion. `
`They were clearly cat eyes, but the way the drool hung from their mouths looked far more terrifying than any cat... `
`"...Will... `
`...Aahhnn..." `
`"I'll handle this. `
`Trimming kitty nails is nothing new to me." `
`The number of jewels surrounding them already reached into the thousands. `
`Will pointed his sword in one direction after another, warding off the surrounding cats... `
`"Get a grip, Lion. `
`You haven't been shot. `
`Don't acknowledge that you have been...no, that you're going to be shot...!" `
`"......Nngggghhh..." `
`Lion tried to fight an incredible tearing pain. `
`No, ...it was a fight against the promised future that Bernkastel had shown. `
`However, the stake of that future, which the Witch of Miracles had guaranteed would contain no miracle, was firm and merciless... `
`Bit by bit, and yet unceasingly, it continued to pierce into Lion's chest... `
`"...Listen up. `
`...I'm going to break through their perimeter for just a second. `
`When I do, you need to run with all you've got. `
`It doesn't matter where. `
`Just make sure you get far away from this place, `
`and keep on running no matter what happens." `
`"......I'll try... `
`to the best of my ability... `
`...If I can't do it, `
`...please forgive me..." `
`"...If you can't do it? `
`Enough whining. `
`I won't forgive you. `
`Neither will Clair. `
`...Did you forget that you're Clair's 1 in 2,578,917 chance? `
`If you give up, you're betraying all the other "yous" in countless worlds...!! `
`So don't lose heart! Keep on struggling and struggling...!! `
`Don't look for a miracle... Be one!!" `
`"...Be...a miracle..." `
`"You're going to reach a happy future. `
`Don't give up, don't complain. `
`Just you try complaining again. `
`This time I'll pinch your ass...!" `
`"......O-Okay..." `
`"*giggle*giggle* `
`Ahhahahahahhahhahhahhahha!! `
`How very confident you are, telling this kid to be a miracle when you stand before the Witch of Miracles...! `
`Miracles are no more than fantasy! `
`Grovel in this world that has been convicted as a mystery, and die horribly like a worm! `
`The witches of theatergoing are looking forward to watching it!!" `
`"...Hmph. `
`You call that mystery? `
`You think I'd ever accept a mystery without heart? `
`Let the cat who wants to be made into a shamisen strike first." `
`"Aah, what a pain. `
`Let's have all of you at once! `
`I'm Willard H. Wright, SSVD's Head Inquisitor of Heresy. `
`This will be the final time I draw my sword...!" `
`"Trash him, kitties." `
`At once, all of the cat eyes opened wide, undulating and spinning in a spiral, then swallowed Will up. `
`But Will and Lion weren't swallowed up. `
`The cats that had flown in at them from all directions were now being launched away, like they were a balloon popping around the pair. `
`"...Oh, not bad." `
`"I don't give a damn about your kitties. `
`It's just the mama cat I care about. `
`......Bernkastel, Witch of Miracles!! `
`It's about time someone trimmed your claws!!" `
`Another flash of the black blade spun in a dark tornado and scattered the cats once more. `
`Lion, realizing that this was the opening Will had planned, ran all out, still clutching at a heaving chest. `
`"...Will, ...I'm running!" `
`"Diana has a weak stomach. `
`Make sure you only give her milk that's warm." `
`"Huh?" `
`By the time Lion asked Will to repeat what he had said, he had already leapt onto the stage and was now confronting Bernkastel. `
`It was like the climax of a show. `
`...Loud cheers erupted from the pitch-black audience seating. `
`On either side of Clair, who lay with her insides exposed, `
`...stood Will, with his pitch-black sword, and Bernkastel, with the scythe that could harvest miracles from fate. `
`"Kyrie and Rudolf are the culprits, and they massacred the people on the island? `
`They called Lion out to the parlor, then shot Lion to death? `
`Sorry, but I can't acknowledge this "truth" of yours as a mystery. `
`This is all fantasy." `
`"Fantasy? `
`You're calling it that to try and let Lion escape fate? `
`By all means, try. `
`*cackle*cackle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*!! `
`Ahhhahhahhahhahahahahahahahaha, hiiyaaaaaaahhaaaaaaaahhh!!!" `
`"{p:1:Rule #1. It is forbidden to have a crime without all clues presented.}" `
`...Surely, Will's black sword must have cut through Bernkastel's body. `
`However, it had no effect, ...like cutting the reflection of the moon on the water. `
`"What's this? `
`What do you mean by "clues"?" `
`"I won't accept your "mystery" with Kyrie and Rudolf as the culprits. `
`...You won't find clues showing that they're the culprits no matter which game you look at." `
`"Of course you won't. `
`Even if they did exist at one point, the whole island blew up." `
`"Which means there aren't any clues. `
`And that means this is no mystery. `
`It's fantasy." `
`"...Huuh...?" `
`It's impossible for an unprovable truth to become truth in the Human world. `
`In other words, even the actual truth cannot cross the boundary of a cat box. `
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`Are you trying to shut the truth inside the cat box? `
`*giggle*giggle* Is this how the mystery genre is supposed to fight? `
`Ahhahhahhahhahahahahahahahaha! `
`Hiiyahhhahahahahahaaaaaaaaahhh!!" `
`With a laugh like the howl of a wild animal, Bernkastel carelessly tossed her scythe aside. `
`"Fighting itself is a waste of time. `
`Get over here, scum. `
`Try and cut me all you like. `
`I'll listen to all you've got to say." `
`"...The twenty wedges will pierce every part of your heartless mystery. `
`Here it comes." `
`"And when you realize that you can't defeat me with those twenty wedges, ...you know what'll happen next, right? `
`*giggle* Come on. `
`I'll play with you, ...if that's what you want!" `
`"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!" `
`Trying to ignore an incredible pain in the chest, ...Lion kept on running and running without stopping. `
`I dashed out of the theater of the theatergoing witches, then ran through an incomprehensible world of blackness. `
`Before I knew it, I was running through a place that looked like a sea of stars, `
`...or maybe the bottom of the ocean with stars scattered around. `
`If I get careless for a second, I'll probably trip. `
`No, if I get careless, I won't be able to tell if I'm running... `
`or just making running motions as I free fall, endlessly sinking deeper into the ocean of stars. `
`I just kept on running, without any goal or target. `
`I mustn't stop moving. `
`I mustn't fall down here. `
`If I fall, ...I'll crush the hope of the 'me's in countless worlds... `
`There's a happy world that the Beatrices dreamed of. `
`And I'm their last hope, the only one who can reach that world... `
`...Even though I understand this, ...the "truth" thrust in front of me by the witch who controls miracles, who says there can be no miracle, `
`is cruelly gouging itself into my chest... `
`"...... `
`...Sorry, ...Will... `
`...My body's...already......" `
`Then, Lion finally... `
`...succumbed to the fierce pain and fate... `
`...and fell over... `
`Lion's body was held roughly from behind and lifted up. `
`".........!! `
`...W-Will...!! `
`You're okay...!" `
`"No, not really. `
`...Don't you give up. Didn't I tell you I'd pinch your ass?" `
`"...Sorry... `
`...I'm really sorry... `
`...But... `
`on that day, in that place, I was fated to be killed..." `
`"That's right. `
`All humans are fated to die in the end. `
`Does that mean their lives are meaningless? `
`Of course not. `
`What a person's life means, what it's worth, what it is...these are things each person decides for themselves. `
`...No matter what sort of fate is forced upon them. `
`Don't accept it. `
`Create your own world...for yourself...!" `
`"......Will, ...your...left arm...!" `
`"Ah, right... Must have forgotten it. `
`It'd be a pain to go back and get it now." `
`There were rips all over Will's body. `
`Also, his left arm had been brutally torn off from the elbow, his clothes were in tatters, ...and he looked like a bloodstained scarecrow... `
`Then, Lion noticed. `
`Though this place had once felt like a sea filled with stars, both above and below them, `
`...those stars had now gathered together and were surrounding them... `
`It was a huge, even number of stars, all glaring at the two of them... `
`Will was holding Lion with one arm. `
`He couldn't take his sword out. `
`However, he didn't let go. `
`...He was determined to let Lion escape from here, to lead Lion towards the happy tale that the Beatrices had dreamed of. `
`Behind the cats whose eyes glowed out of the empty darkness, ...the queen of cats who permitted no miracles appeared... `
`"......Willard, `
`put Lion down. `
`If you do, I'll let you go." `
`"Go file a protest with the Great Court. `
`You can put it up for debate." `
`"...Will, `
`...I..." `
`"I won't leave you behind. `
`...I need to tell you. `
`To tell you why I quit SSVD." `
`"...Come to think of it, even I don't know that. `
`...Why'd you do it?" `
`"It's because I got fed up with all those damn sob story mysteries. `
`...We'll survive and reach a happy ending." `
`"I'll show her. `
`Beatrice died in despair, thinking that there were only bad endings. `
`I'll show her that a happy ending can exist. That's why I'll never put you down." `
`"......Will..." `
`"You can take the rest of my left arm, cats. `
`I'll give you my legs too, if you want them. `
`...But I'm not letting go of Lion here. `
`...I'll take Lion away from the bad ending you represent, even if I have to crawl my way out of here...!" `
`"Are you okay with this, Lion? `
`Will's planning to die protecting you. `
`You don't want that, right? `
`Go ahead and tell him to leave you be and save himself." `
`"......Will..." `
`"Yeah." `
`"...Please, ...don't leave me here...! `
`...I'll certainly survive! `
`And so will you...!!" `
`"That's the spirit." `
`As he said this, Will held Lion tight. `
`"There you have it. `
`We'll keep struggling on, Bernkastel." `
`"We won't give up on the chance of a miracle...!" `
`"You're saying that? When the Witch of Miracles has promised with certainty that there will be no miracles? `
`......*giggle*giggle* `
`Hehehehehehahahahahahaha!! `
`So long, you two. `
`Go collect dust in the depths of oblivion, unable even to die, and disappear!!" `
`"Come, my kitties. `
`I won't order you to kill them. `
`Just clean up the two pieces whose role has ended." `
`A hundred million, a trillion, ten quadrillion cats all bared their fangs. `
`In the starry sky of cat eyes, countless flesh-colored mouths opened, exposing countless teeth. `
`{a:c:...The world was wrapped in flesh and blood and fangs.} `
