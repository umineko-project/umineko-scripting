`"Yasu, `
`what'd you do with the small broom?" `
`"...Didn't you use it to clean the window frames?" `
`Ah, ...... `
`The small broom is a little, thin broom that looks like a large paintbrush. `
`We use it to clear out the dust in small corners, like window frames. `
`It's one of the cleaning tools I was put in charge of... `
`"Come on, that's your responsibility! `
`What have you been doing, idiot?!" `
`"Quickly, go and find it... `
`You have to do it before Madam finds out..." `
`"What's up?" `
`"Yasu lost the small broom again. `
`The kid must be some sort of genius at losing things!" `
`"That's why I'm always telling you, never give things to Yasu. `
`Yasu's always careless and losing things." `
`"Don't say that. Can't you see that this kid's working hard...? `
`Go on, hurry and find it. `
`I'll wait for you." `
`O-Okay... `
`Not wanting to hear my fellow servants complain even more, I spun around and headed off. `
`If you lose a tool, you get in trouble. `
`If no one knows who did it, we all get yelled at, `
`so one of them will probably tell Madam that it was my fault. `
`Still, it really is my fault that I lost it in the first place. `
`I wonder when I lost it. `
`When, when... `
`We cleaned out the entire chapel today. `
`The chapel is a large building behind the mansion. `
`However, no one ever goes near it normally. `
`Even so, we are ordered to clean it a few times each year. `
`Kinzo calls it a sacred building, so Natsuhi is very strict about it... `
`We'd cleaned every little nook and cranny, from top to bottom. `
`It had taken all day. `
`I had been in charge of cleaning the window frames, but I had also been given many smaller tasks. `
`While those small jobs were keeping me busy, I completely forgot about the small broom, `
`and I must've left it lying around somewhere. `
`...I began to hate myself for it. `
`This isn't the first time this has happened. `
`It happens all the time. `
`Every time I set something down, it always disappears. `
`It goes somewhere else. Vanishes. `
`I thought it was probably the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, pranking me. `
`The ghost of the witch gained power from Rokkenjima's evil spirits and was reborn. `
`Until Kumasawa-san told me, I never knew the meaning of the shrine on the rocks by the sea...... `
`"Kumasawa told an old, old tale, passed down among the local fishermen. `
`Rokkenjima used to be known as Akujikishima, `
`and terrible evil spirits who ate human souls lived there..." `
`"Hey, Kumasawa! `
`Let us hear too!" `
`"Tell us the scary, scary tale of Rokkenjima's evil spirits!" `
`"Hohoho, very well, very well. `
`Rokkenjima was once called Azukishima. `
`However, even deeper in the distant past, it was known as Akujikishima. `
`It was rumored that sailors who went too near the island were dragged down to the bottom of the sea and had their souls eaten. `
`...Yes, frightening spirits such as those do exist on this island. `
`Hohohoho." `
`"It was Kumasawa's favorite ghost story. `
`Every new servant who came to the island heard about it. `
`......Such stories are usually laughed off, `
`but when stormy nights visited Rokkenjima, bringing an eerie howling to that lonely island where nothing exists except the Ushiromiya mansion, everyone would listen meekly." `
`"The shrine by the coast was there to seal the evil spirits away!" `
`"And the Master had that creepy occult hobby!" `
`"And the mansion was so spooky, it was easy to picture something hiding in the shadows!" `
`"Hohohoho. `
`True, true. `
`The traveling shugenja monk was only barely able to suppress those spirits. `
`The seal just managed to hold them, but to this very day, they wander through the mansion, night after night, searching for a victim. `
`Hohohoho..." `
`"Have you seen the Master's study?!" `
`"I have! `
`It's like some kind of demon laboratory!" `
`"There's that rumor about the Master researching demons!" `
`"They also say he's researching how to revive his mistress, Beatrice!" `
`"Didn't they say he was gathering children to be sacrifices for his magic experiments?!" `
`"Waah, scary! `
`What'd you do if the Master asked you to come into the study alone?!" `
`"I heard that, long ago, one kid went into the study and never came out!" `
`"That must've been a victim of an experiment to give Beatrice's ghost a new body!" `
`"Hohoho. `
`Very true. {f:5:Beatrice}-sama has become a ghost...and wanders around searching for a body. `
`The VIP room on the second floor is where {f:5:Beatrice}-sama dwells... `
`You must always be respectful when cleaning that room... `
`If you aren't... `
`...uhihihihihhihhiii!" `
`"In the eyes of teenage boys and girls, with their powerful imaginations, the ghost story was both terrifying and fascinating. `
`It gave them a sense of solidarity, since they all got to experience the same tale. `
`Then, that sharing became an obligation, `
`and accepting the story became a rite of passage for joining the community. `
`This was something that had been passed on since long ago." `
`"That's right. `
`Back when I first started work at Rokkenjima, `
`I heard that story from Kumasawa-san and the older servants." `
`"I heard about it too, mostly from Nee-san." `
`"I heard it too. `
`From Kumasawa-san, mainly." `
`"So, not only the timid-looking Shannon, `
`but a boy, Kanon, and a big adult, Gohda, believed in the ghost story?" `
`"Well, I didn't really..." `
`"There are tales of ghost stories and jinxes in all jobs. `
`There were several stories of the sort at the hotel I once worked at." `
`"So, you thought it was silly, and you didn't mind it at all?" `
`"...I think there was a need to blend with the community." `
`"That's it. `
`Ghost stories and jinxes are the local rules of your workplace. `
`If a newcomer breaks those rules, they can't expect to be welcomed in." `
`"Exactly. `
`...If I said witches couldn't possibly exist, that the whole idea was ridiculous, then I'd get into a fight with Nee-san. `
`It was easier if I just appeared to go along with it." `
`"Come on. If you think that way, you'll be cursed... `
`There was one servant who got seriously injured..." `
`"Hahaha, all workplaces have stories like that. `
`No matter how incredible the ghost stories and tales about the company founder are, you accept and believe them. `
`That's what it means to blend in with your new workplace." `
`""Wow! `
`Everyone's so mature!"" `
`I went to each window around the chapel in the order I had cleaned them, searching carefully in all the places I might have left it. `
`I had been cleaning the windows with it, so it had probably been set down near one of those. `
`When did I leave it behind, I wonder... `
`Now that I think about it, I don't think I had it anymore when I reached the last window, `
`so I must've completely forgotten to clean that window frame. `
`"......Ah." `
`Through the window, I could see the others leaving one after another. `
`Shannon turned around and glanced up, looking worried. `
`...I don't want to be responsible for making everyone wait, so I'm actually glad they're leaving without me... `
`If I said I wanted them to wait for me, I'd be relying on them too much... `
`The sun's beginning to set, and the chapel's getting darker and darker. `
`I don't want to hang around in a place like this all by myself. `
`I'd better find the small broom fast. `
`No, that's not all. `
`I also need to clean the window frames I forgot. `
`Madam is strict. `
`She'll probably check all of the windows carefully. `
`If she does, I'll be the one who gets in trouble tomorrow. `
`But really, where did I lose it? `
`Why did I lose it? `
`The darkness grew and grew. `
`...When it became dark enough that I would need a light before long, I began to panic. `
`I dashed around and around the chapel, tears streaming down my face... `
`As I stumbled about pathetically, `
`I could feel the presence of a prankster witch, giggling at me from the crack of the door and gaps in the ceiling. `
`The ghost of {f:5:Beatrice}, the Master's mistress, wanders about in search of a body to this very day. `
`As she absorbs the power of Rokkenjima's evil spirits, her strength steadily grows, and she waits for the day of her resurrection. `
`And, ...for some reason, she's peeking out at me, `
`and if I ever take my eyes off something for a second, she snatches it away and hides it. `
`This isn't the first time this has happened. `
`Whenever I look away, ...keys, handkerchiefs, pencils, erasers... `
`all of them vanish almost right away. `
`Even though I was planning to use them later, or just wanted to put them in their proper place, `
`they disappear as soon as I turn around. `
`It isn't someone hiding them as a prank. `
`It's happened many times when I'm the only person around. `
`...Everyone always says I'm too careless and forgetful, and they laugh at me, ...get mad at me. `
`I do try to be alert, `
`but like some kind of bad joke, I lose things easily when I forget about them for just a short while. `
`So, sometimes, I think "this eraser is gonna disappear sooner or later", and I stare at it. `
`But at those times alone, it doesn't disappear. `
`Nothing disappears when I'm alert. `
`But as soon as I think I'm safe, and the tension relaxes just a bit, then something else will disappear...! `
`Why is it always me...?! `
`{a:c: `
`*giggle*giggle*, `
`...hehehehehahahaha...} `
`...Yeah, I hear you. `
`I can tell that the witch is laughing at me as I lamely run around in circles... `
`{a:c: `
`*giggle*giggle*, `
`...hehehehahahaha... `
`Ahahahahahahahahahaha...} `
`Listening to that voiceless laugh, I finally slammed my hands against the wall, crying tears of frustration. `
`"Please, just stop it...!! `
`Why do you always hide my things and get me in trouble?!" `
`And, the witch answered. `
`Fool. `
`...Isn't it obvious? `
`Why else, except to entertain myself by watching you wander about pointlessly? `
`*cackle*cackle*, hyahhahahahahahahahhahhahha...!! `
`I couldn't bear it. `
`Even though I knew what she said was true, hearing it said directly was incredibly annoying. `
`I understand. `
`That small broom probably is somewhere in this chapel. `
`No, that's not quite it. `
`I'm sure that the moment before I reached this window, it was right there on the windowsill. `
`That's right, I'm sure I put it by this window. `
`But the prankster witch {f:5:Beatrice} used her magic, `
`and just before I reached this spot, she instantly teleported the small broom to the next window over. `
`The instant I approached that window, `
`a hole appeared beneath the small broom, swallowing it up. `
`And it came out by the next window after that. `
`It landed right inside it, as though it had been there the whole time. `
`And this happened over and over again! `
`As I ran up to that window, the small broom fell into a magic hole and went to the next window. `
`And when I went to that window, it went to the next window...! `
`And I realized that she was just making fun of me! `
`So no matter how much I searched, it would be useless. `
`But if I stop searching, it'll be just sitting there by one window or another. `
`So, this isn't a search. `
`It's a test of endurance. `
`I kept chasing after the small broom, `
`and {f:5:Beatrice} kept making it escape to the next window over, trying to make me give up. `
`This is an eternal chase...that'll end only when one of us gives up...! `
`So, I kept going around and around, even to windows that I knew I'd already searched. `
`If it's not by this one, then try the next one, and the next one. `
`And the witch kept moving the small broom to the next window, and the next...! `
`"Just give it a rest...!! `
`How long are you going to make fun of me? `
`This isn't the only time... You always do this!!" `
`{a:c: `
`*giggle*, `
`heh `
`heh `
`hah `
`hahahahahahahahahaha...!!} `
`The shrill, voiceless laugh of the formless witch continued to mock my sobbing. `
`The witch is right beside me, laughing at me. `
`As I dash around the chapel, she's following along with me, taunting me. `
`Then... `
`she must be... `
`there. `
`She's right behind me, just over my shoulder, `
`still cackling away. `
`I know that turning around won't help, since she has no form. `
`I can try to look, but I mustn't look with my eyes. `
`Once my eyes tell me there's nothing there, I won't be able to "see" anymore. `
`I learned that from the Director of the Fukuin House. `
`...You mustn't try to see with your eyes. `
`...You must "see" with the eyes of your heart. `
`The whole world is filled with God's love. `
`In the many blessings of everyday life, one can see God, angels, and the Holy Ghost. `
`If you try to look with your eyes, you won't see them, so you won't be able to "see" them. `
`So you won't be able to feel them or understand them. `
`With the eyes of the heart, you will quietly understand. `
`You don't look at their image. `
`You "see"...and draw them with your heart. `
`In this way, I learned how to recognize beings not of this world at the Fukuin House. `
`...It doesn't just mean being able to "see" God. `
`This power lets one "see" all of those not of this world. `
`"...Please, stop it now. `
`Stop this prank." `
`"......Hoh. `
`...So, you can speak to me?" `
`"I'm clumsy, bad at my job, ...and I do put things down and forget about them a lot. `
`...But I know which things were my fault, and which things were because of your pranks." `
`"How amusing... `
`Not only can you perceive me in my formless state, but you even understand my little game. `
`......It seems you're a more interesting creature than I thought, `
`Yasu." `
`...I'm usually called Yasu when one of the older servants is laughing behind my back at some mistake I've made. `
`So, when I hear that name, it feels bad. `
`She called me, not by the blessed name given to me by the Fukuin House, but by that unblessed name. `
`Upsetting the heart is a classic move that evil beings make. `
`They do it to make it harder for people to notice their presence. `
`To beings like witches, being understood is like shoving them out into the light of day. `
`"...It won't work. `
`In the Fukuin House, I learned how to perceive those not of this world. `
`So, I'm already able to understand you." `
`"Very interesting. `
`......You've taken me, a being so faint that I'd fly away if you blew on me, and trapped me, perceived me. `
`...You're an interesting kid, Yasu!" `
`"It won't work. `
`I've now understood and perceived you. `
`No matter how many unpleasant things you say, you'll just expose the ugliness of your heart." `
`Without turning around, ...I slowly let my range of vision fill the entire chapel. `
`It was as though the viewpoint of my soul was floating out from the shell of my head. `
`...See? `
`...Inch by inch, `
`...my range of vision is floating out of my head... `
`...and drifting upwards. `
`As I looked down at myself, standing there with head hanging and eyes tightly shut... `
`...my mind's eye... `
`...very slowly... `
`...rose up to the ceiling of the chapel. `
`And when I looked down from there... `
`I saw myself, standing in the center of the chapel, ...and the witch standing behind me. `
`...Apparently, the witch realized that I could "see" her. `
`She turned around... `
`...and raised her eyes to look at the eyes of my heart, floating by the ceiling... `
`...At last, `
`I could see the witch {f:5:Beatrice}... `
`...with the eyes of my heart... `
`"A mere Human... `
`...that can perceive my form...?" `
`The demonic lips...twisted in an ugly curve. `
`It was clearly a challenging, repulsive...demon's smile... `
`She wore a blood-red dress and hat. `
`The design was completely different from anything Humans wore. `
`Her hair was blonde. `
`It had countless beautiful curls, like a princess from a picture book, `
`...but there was no trace of cuteness about her. `
`"...I did think you were a bit different from the other Humans, `
`but it seems I was mistaken." `
`"............" `
`"Forget just "a bit", you're nothing like those other Humans. `
`*cackle*cackle*...!" `
`"You sad witch, who can be seen by no one, heard by no one. `
`...Have you been pulling these pranks all the time just to catch the attention of Humans...?" `
`"I use what little magic I have to interfere when Humans aren't looking, but no matter what I do, none of them think it's magic. `
`...They decide that they just made a little mistake, `
`and blow my existence away like the candles on a cake." `
`"If so, then I've just saved you. `
`Because I understand you...and have perceived you." `
`"...Saved me? `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*! `
`To me, this meeting with you is nothing more than a new way to kill time." `
`"It's getting dark. `
`I don't have time to play with you anymore." `
`"Oho. `
`My apologies. I was so engrossed that I didn't notice the time." `
`"...Please give it back. `
`My cleaning tool." `
`"That small broom, or whatever you call it? `
`It's right there, by the next window." `
`"But as soon as I get close, you'll move it to the next window over." `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`My form is elusive, as is my magic. `
`With a snap of my fingers, I can do anything...!" `
`The witch snapped her fingers, and various things throughout the chapel were sucked into a black pitfall beneath them, disappearing. `
`No, they didn't disappear. `
`The instant they vanished into the dark holes, other dark holes appeared in completely different parts of the chapel, and the vanished objects fell out of those. `
`Chairs, musical scores, clocks, and vases started appearing and disappearing all across the room. `
`It made it feel as though countless tools were flying about the chapel... `
`"I can do things like this, but don't. `
`After all, this would be a bit beyond a mere prank, don't you think...?" `
`I wonder what the difference between a prank and magic is to a witch. `
`When she snapped her fingers again, all of the loud, flying objects returned to their original spots, `
`and silence fell. `
`"I've taken a liking to you. `
`...You've perceived and captured me? `
`*cackle*cackle*! `
`It works the same in reverse. `
`I've perceived and captured you." `
`"............" `
`The Fukuin Director told me not to try and "see" evil beings. `
`If you "see" them, they will possess you. `
`Now that I understood this witch, a bond had been formed between us. `
`"That is correct. `
`Now that you have acknowledged my existence, I have formed a bond with you. `
`...After all the years I've spent in boredom, it will be nice to have a young kid like you to talk to." `
`"I'll talk to you from time to time. `
`So, will you stop pulling pranks like this?" `
`"No, I'm not here to talk to you, but to play with you! `
`*cackle*cackle* And if we're playing, pranks are just part of the game, right?" `
`"............" `
`"Heheh. `
`...Very well. `
`I've had enough fun for one day. `
`The sun has sunk and the moon is full. `
`I'm a bit tired after appearing in front of you for so long. `
`Let us call it a night. `
`Look how much fun we had with just a single broom...!" `
`"Please, give it back." `
`"No way. `
`I'll keep this as a token of our meeting. `
`Got a problem with that?" `
`"...If I said I did, would you give it back to me?" `
`"I never listen to Humans! `
`...However, I might lend an ear to a friend." `
`"...If you give it back, ...I'll acknowledge you as a friend." `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...! `
`Foolish Human, did you actually think that alone would make me want to deal...?! `
`...If you want to make a deal with me, try drawing a mysterious magic circle or two! `
`...And yet, I might consider your proposal." `
`"What do you mean, you might...?" `
`"I'll take my time in deciding whether you're worthy to be my friend. `
`...After all, to be a witch is to be a contrarian, an amanojaku! `
`If you ask us for an answer, we'll never give one right away. `
`*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"...Understood. `
`Then, ...I'll leave the small broom with you. `
`Please give it back when you decide to become my friend." `
`"Very well. `
`Will this broom become a bridge of friendship between us, or not? `
`...I will hang onto it for now, making my decision in my own good time." `
`When the witch snapped her fingers, the broom for which I had searched so long fell out of a hole in the air, `
`landing between the fingers she had just snapped... `
`"This is goodbye. `
`...This game with you was far from boring. `
`Let us play again sometime." `
`"If you're my friend, that is." `
`"When a cat toys with a mouse, does it try to become friends with it first? `
`*cackle*cackle*, ahahahahahahahahahaa!!" `
`The witch faded away... `
`As she did, the eyes of my heart shut themselves... `
`When I returned to my body, I felt suddenly tired and let out the breath I'd been holding. `
`...Of course, when I turned around, there was no one to be seen. `
`I couldn't feel the witch's presence anywhere anymore. `
`It had gotten very dark by this time. `
`I decided to leave the chapel. `
`There's no point in searching for the small broom any longer. `
`...Not until the witch decides to give it back. `
`I went out of the chapel. `
`The chapel key had been left in the lock. `
`I used it to lock the door. `
`...What am I going to do about the small broom? `
`There's nothing I can do. `
`I can't even blame the witch. `
`I must acknowledge that I'm responsible for giving the witch a chance... `
`"......Nn-" `
`When I happened to glance downwards, ...I saw a small broom lying there by my feet. `
`It was the broom I had been searching for all this time. `
`...Don't tell me... `
`that it'll be swallowed up by a dark hole the instant I bend over to pick it up...? `
`No. `
`This is...a sign from the witch. `
`A sign that she acknowledges me as a friend. `
`I picked it up. `
`Oh, I am one yet many. `
`"The first friend I made after coming to the island was apparently not a Human at all. `
`However, when I think back on it, it was only natural. `
`What other sort of friend would you expect to make on a witch's island? `
`This was the first meeting between me and {f:5:Beatrice}." `
`"...However, as some of you listeners may have noticed, this was not a meeting with the real {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`The witch I then called {f:5:Beatrice} would later be known by another name." `
`"...However, she was clearly not human. `
`And being bonded with one who is not human means being bonded with their world. `
`I still had no way of knowing the varied fates that waited for me on Rokkenjima..." `
