`The months and years slid by. `
`In my new, more colorful life, I smiled at the spring sunshine peeking through the trees, gazed up at the column of summer clouds, `
`enjoyed the piles of fallen leaves in autumn, and played in the winter snow the few times it did fall. `
`As these days passed one after another, there was a considerable change to my environment. `
`The servants coming from the Fukuin House had switched. `
`There weren't specific grades like in school, so there was no rule saying how long a servant could work before quitting. `
`Each servant made their own decision about when they would "graduate" from Rokkenjima. `
`Some of those who couldn't stand the environment would quit in as little as three days. `
`After all, life on Rokkenjima was strict. `
`It was also strict in the Fukuin House, of course, but there were a lot of Rokkenjima-only rules, `
`and Natsuhi, the one who supervised the servants, was also very authoritarian. `
`It was probably easy to feel trapped. `
`That trapped feeling and the money sat on opposite sides of the scale that they used to decide the time of their graduation. `
`And sometimes, someone from the Ushiromiya family would use their influence to secure someone a new job, encouraging them to spread their wings and start a new life. `
`The cycle usually lasted two or three years. `
`No one decided this, but it was one of the goals most servants shot for, an unspoken rule. `
`However, I was an exception to that rule. `
`I continued to go to school on Niijima while still living as a servant... `
`That year, all of the Fukuin House servants quit at once. `
`It wasn't at all rare for friends to quit at the same time as each other. `
`All of my fellow servants from the Fukuin House graduated from the island at once, leaving only me behind... `
`Of course, I wasn't on particularly good terms with them. `
`On the contrary, it was annoying to be treated like a kid and called Yasu all the time. `
`Though some new servants had come after me, `
`the older ones had already gotten them believing that "Yasu loses things all the time", `
`so it wasn't really any more pleasant to have new comrades. `
`Those unpleasant older servants, as well as the ones who started at the same time or after I did, all quit at once. `
`The Ushiromiya family made no effort to stop them from leaving. `
`Adult servants were easier to handle in the first place. `
`The Fukuin House servants were only accepted so that they could be trained. `
`And so, all of the servants besides me left, and no one tried to stop them... `
`"Later, Yasu. `
`Don't go losing stuff again." `
`"...I don't lose things anymore." `
`"Hmph, later. `
`Make sure you listen to what Madam says. `
`Don't you go troubling the next group of servants." `
`"...You know, it's still a mystery. `
`Why was Yasu recommended for this job?" `
`"It's even more surprising that Madam let Yasu stay this long." `
`"It must've taken some guts to not give up and run away. `
`Keep it up, Yasu." `
`"I-I...hate being called Yasu..." `
`At the very end, ...I finally said the one thing I'd always wanted to say to them. `
`However, they basically ignored me, and just picked up their things and left... `
`"............" `
`"...I guess you never got a chance to become friends with them." `
`"I didn't even want to." `
`"Yeah. `
`I'm sure they feel the same way, so you're even. `
`Let's just forget about those people. `
`They no longer have anything to do with us. `
`So, there's no reason to think about them." `
`"...Yeah. `
`...You're right." `
`I felt just a bit disappointed. `
`I never got a chance to prove to them that I could take care of myself. `
`"It's hard for people to throw off their first impressions. `
`...That's just how it is. `
`No matter how wonderfully you grow, `
`those people would've probably always called you Yasu and made fun of you. `
`There's no reason for you to want their admiration." `
`"...Yes. `
`Yeah, you're right, Shannon. `
`I'll completely forget about those people." `
`"Good. `
`You have two great friends, Kumasawa-san and me. `
`And if you want to prove that you can take care of yourself, prove it to the new servants who are coming." `
`Shannon was exactly right. `
`Ever since that day when I held the key with the spiderweb charm up high, I'd regained my confidence and pride. `
`...I am now the most experienced Fukuin servant. `
`The new servants who come will still probably be older than me, `
`but I need to teach them the ropes as the more experienced servant. `
`Genji-sama even told me to lead the newer servants as a senpai... `
`Okay. `
`...I'll give it my all. `
`"That's the right attitude. `
`Let's give it our all together." `
`"Yeah!" `
`"My name is Asne ({p:0:明日音}). `
`Pleased to meet you." `
`"My name is Belne ({p:0:靘音}). `
`Pleased to meet you." `
`...... `
`The newly arrived servants looked...a bit superficial. `
`When I first joined the Ushiromiya family, I was incredibly nervous. `
`However, I couldn't see any trace of that nervousness on these girls... `
`"That's right. `
`Usually, kids with good grades and behavior were selected." `
`"How were they selected? `
`Who did it?" `
`"The board of directors came and interviewed them. `
`And they were judged on other things, like their everyday conduct..." `
`"So! As long as they acted like good kids in front of the adults, they could pass?" `
`"...Well, `
`ummm, `
`...there were times that they passed because the adults watching them decided they would do fine..." `
`"All of the children who came from the Fukuin House were highly individualistic. `
`They polished that attitude while they worked as servants, `
`and eventually grew to be servants who would not shame the Ushiromiya family." `
`"However, encouraging this behavior was the role of the more experienced servants. `
`...Since I was the only one with experience, it was my responsibility to guide them." `
`"What were the new kids like?" `
`"They were the elite, of course! `
`Of irreproachable conduct!" `
`"...I think they were like that when Madam and Genji-sama were around. `
`However, `
`...when their superiors weren't around, `
`...well, they didn't take things quite as seriously..." `
`"Asne-san, `
`...make sure you put your tools on the cart when you're done using them." `
`"Kyahhahahahaha! `
`...Huh? `
`Suuure. Sooorry." `
`I also have to be alert as a more experienced servant. `
`"And Belne-san, you shouldn't set your key down in a place like that. `
`You'll lose it." `
`"I'm not gonna lose it. `
`I never forget where I put things." `
`When I first arrived here, the older servants would often tell me off just as I had done now. `
`They would probably have been mean and obnoxious about it. `
`I had hated that, so I tried to be more gentle when admonishing them, but they wouldn't take me seriously... `
`"L-Listen up. `
`You know there's a witch living in the mansion, don't you...?" `
`"Oooh, {f:5:Beatriiice}!" `
`"Kyahahahaha! That sounded just like him!" `
`"Don't tell me `
`you believe in that too, Shannon-chan?" `
`"Y-Yes, she really exists... `
`If you leave things lying around, the witch will prank you and hide them..." `
`"It's true. `
`I've gotten into trouble many times because of it..." `
`"A witch hiding things?" `
`"That's totally impossible." `
`"After all-" `
`"There's no way witches could exist! `
`Kyahhahahahaha!" `
`"There's no way they could exist. `
`...Witches." `
`"...I thought they were just pranks. `
`No, ...it was just easier to think of it that way." `
`"Do you think the witch {f:5:Beatrice} actually existed...?" `
`"I don't believe it." `
`"...I don't know if it was {f:5:Beatrice}, `
`but I do think that something inhuman... `
`really did exist in that mansion." `
`"Do you think there's a chance that this nonhuman thing was {f:5:Beatrice}...?" `
`"Ridiculous." `
`"...I wish I could say it was ridiculous." `
`"That must've been a prank of Yasu's. No, not a prank, revenge." `
`"I did think that at first, but..." `
`"Did something happen that couldn't be explained away as a prank...?" `
`"...It was persistent. `
`...And creepy." `
`"What kinds of things happened, specifically?" `
`"Things I set down would disappear as soon as I looked away for a second." `
`"Didn't Yasu just hide them?" `
`"I thought so at first. `
`It was only natural to think that. `
`But I started getting this feeling that something wasn't right. `
`I kept thinking...could such a timid kid really get away with something so obnoxious?" `
`"Can you tell us what happened?" `
`"...When my key ring disappeared, it was easy to think that Yasu snatched it when I wasn't looking. `
`...But when a single key disappeared off my key ring and reappeared somewhere completely different, `
`I couldn't think of it that way." `
`"Maybe Yasu just pulled that one key off while you weren't looking...?" `
`"Is that even possible?! Practically speaking?! `
`Hiding the whole ring is one thing, `
`but if you really think about it, taking a single key off the key ring isn't that easy! `
`The keys would clatter together. `
`I was standing right next to them, just facing the other way, get it? `
`If you took your time removing a key when I was that close, even an idiot like me would've noticed!" `
`"But a single key just vanished without a sound. `
`...At that moment, I finally realized. `
`This wasn't Yasu trying to get back at me, `
`...it was something... `
`...worse... `
`than that." `
`"And where did you find this disappearing key?" `
`"It was... `
`...in my locker." `
`"Well, you can be pretty absent-minded, Belne... `
`Are you sure you didn't just take that key off and put it in your locker...?" `
`"Why would I take that key off the ring?! `
`Have you ever taken a key off or put a key on your key ring, Asne?! `
`I tried doing it myself. `
`It's really stiff! `
`I'd never go to all that trouble. `
`There'd be no point! `
`Am I a sleepwalker or something?! `
`How could I not remember something I've done?!" `
`"I may be stupid, but I'm not that stupid! `
`I don't forget about things I do that easily!! `
`And anyway, I know I had my key with me when I entered the room! `
`Otherwise, how could I have unlocked the door?!" `
`"...Okay then... `
`Yasu, careful not to make any sound, `
`slipped the key off... `
`and hid it in your locker. `
`That has to be it..." `
`"That's what I thought at first! `
`I jumped at Yasu, telling that kid not to mess with me! `
`But even as I said it, I realized. `
`Isn't there something completely wrong here?!" `
`"After all, on that day, we were cleaning that room with Yasu the whole time, right?! `
`There wouldn't have been time for Yasu to noisily remove a key! `
`It was impossible for Yasu! `
`In fact, it should've been impossible for anyone!!" `
`"M-Maybe the ring was missing a master key when you got it..." `
`"I already told you!! `
`The key really was there in the beginning! `
`I was the one who unlocked that room! `
`So it must have been there! `
`...And then, I went into the room! `
`I'm stupid, and since I hate having the keys clattering around, I placed the ring on the bed...!" `
`"Then, when we finished cleaning, I picked up the ring, tried to lock the door, and it was gone! `
`I may have turned my back on the ring, but it was right next to me! `
`So, if someone tried to pull a prank by removing just one key, I'd have heard the clinking! `
`And yet, just the key for that room vanished and appeared again in my locker!!" `
`"...So okay, let's say that Yasu managed to sneak it away. `
`It's easier to think of that way. `
`...But still! `
`How could Yasu have put it in my locker?! `
`Yasu and I were together the whole time, right?! `
`When I started yelling about it being gone and ran all over the place looking for it, Yasu was with me until the moment I found it in my locker, get it?!" `
`"I'm telling you it's impossible!! `
`Even as I jumped at Yasu, I began to feel it. `
`I mean, Yasu's eyes seemed to be saying it silently. `
`...According to Yasu, the reason things used to go missing all the time wasn't because Yasu was forgetful, as everyone said, ...but actually... `
`it was because... `
`impossible things would suddenly happen, just like they had to me, `
`...and...and...!" `
`"...Yasu was with you the whole time, so there was no chance for Yasu to put the key in the locker?" `
`"Did other strange things like that happen?" `
`"Yeah, they did. `
`Afterwards, other things happened...and not just things disappearing... Over and over... `
`...Of course, I started getting nervous and made sure not to put things down in places like that, ...but that didn't help." `
`"...At first, I was angry at Yasu, `
`...but at some point, I began to realize that I was mistaken. `
`One time, a key even disappeared from a ring that I'd left in my pocket! `
`Then, I realized. `
`...These weren't Yasu's pranks. `
`The same thing that happened to Yasu was now happening to me...!" `
`"C-Calm down a bit... `
`I think some of those were Yasu's fault, `
`and the others were just you being clumsy. `
`...It's true that the mansion's always dark and eerie, `
`...and it does feel like the sort of place you'd find a curse. `
`I'm sure that's what made you scared like that..." `
`"You saw it too, didn't you?! `
`Remember that vanishing white shadow we saw in the VIP room that rainy day?!" `
`"...Y-Yes, I saw, `
`but couldn't that just have been Madam or Milady wearing something white...?" `
`"What do you mean, something white?! `
`Have you ever seen either of them wearing something like that?! `
`And besides, that VIP room is always locked! `
`They don't have keys to it! `
`That had to have been some kind of ghost... `
`...no, the silhouette of the witch!" `
`"...... `
`...Ha...hahaha... `
`So, basically, ...Belne started acting like this. `
`Totally scared. `
`...I've got more street smarts than her, `
`so the more scared she was, the more I thought that witches were stupid and couldn't exist." `
`"...Still, I had to be careful about what I said. `
`...I mean, I realized that this wasn't something I should talk about carelessly. `
`...All ghost stories and curses sound stupid to outsiders. `
`...But to the people who believe in them, it's absolutely not a joking matter. `
`It really was...no joke." `
`"...Asne didn't believe a word of what I said. `
`So, I eventually stopped telling her about it...and confessed to Yasu instead. `
`I told Yasu "I thought you were the culprit, but it couldn't have been you". `
`I said that something... `
`...strange...was happening to me...!" `
`"...And what was that kid's answer?" `
`"Yasu said that the same thing had happened many times already, but no one else believed any of it...! `
`In the first place, the older servants always made fun of Yasu, but that kid clearly wasn't as clumsy or stupid as they said. `
`I hated having a younger person tell me what to do, so I always resisted, but Yasu always got our work done flawlessly. `
`I've always thought it strange that people made fun of Yasu for losing things...!" `
`"I was sure then. `
`It "existed"! `
`Some strange, inhuman thing "existed" in this mansion!" `
`"And that thing was the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}...?" `
`"If that's what you want to call it, I'll believe it. `
`Anyway, something that couldn't be explained away by human actions definitely "existed" there! `
`People who didn't understand kept calling Yasu and me forgetful! `
`They didn't get it... They just didn't get it!!" `
`"...St-Still, `
`...it did freak you out for a while, but then you got a lot better... `
`After that, all that fuss about you losing things went away, right...? `
`So it must've been your imagination all the time..." `
`"You're wrong!! `
`I talked to Yasu, to Shannon, and Kumasawa-san and the others about it! `
`And they said that the witch really did exist..." `
`"The old servants all made sure to respect her! `
`They said I'd been cursed because I'd stupidly gone around saying that {f:5:Beatrice} didn't exist...! `
`So I reformed! `
`Yasu taught me how to give offerings to the doll in the VIP room! `
`I asked Genji-sama for permission and prayed at the shrine by the sea! `
`And then it all stopped, all at once!! `
`You were okay, Asne, since you stopped making fun of the witch partway through, `
`but if you'd cluelessly gone on making fun of her, you'd surely have been cursed next! `
`Yes, I guarantee it! You definitely would've been cursed...!!" `
`"...I guess... `
`even I was creeped out by you two... `
`I never said it out loud, but..." `
`"You just don't get it! `
`You really don't!! `
`So, I made sure to teach all the newer servants well! `
`A witch called {f:5:Beatrice}-sama lives in this mansion...! `
`If you make fun of her, you really will be cursed...!!" `
`"......Belne..." `
`"When...things disappeared, that was a sign that the witch was close by and watching us... `
`If you said it was a prank, or that witches couldn't exist, `
`you'd be cursed even more...!! `
`It was like that for both Yasu and me! `
`When the key disappeared, `
`...that was a sign that the witch had appeared...!!" `
`Belne-san carelessly tossed her key ring on the bed again, humming as she started to clean... `
`No matter how much I warn her, she doesn't change her ways. `
`She's always making fun of me and calling me Yasu, so she won't listen to what I tell her... `
`Why won't she listen to what I say...? `
`You mustn't leave things lying carelessly about. `
`If you lower your guard, the witch will prank you... `
`"...Ahyahhyahhya! `
`Look at that delicious key ring..." `
`"St-Stop it, please...! `
`That's Belne-san's key! `
`Keep your pranking to me alone. `
`Let the others be...!" `
`"With how cautious you've grown, you're no fun anymore. `
`...*cackle*cackle* Just kidding." `
`"Still, how unpleasant these people are, refusing to listen to my friend's kindly advice. `
`Any insult to my friend I take as an insult to myself...!" `
`"...Are you planning to steal Belne-san's key...? `
`Please, don't do it...! `
`She'll think I hid it again...!" `
`"She thinks my magic is naught but the scheme of a child like you...?! `
`*cackle*cackle* Very well then. `
`Let's just show her something that would be impossible for a Human...!" `
`"Let's show her my magic!! `
`Foolish Belne! `
`I'll make you regret not listening to my friend's advice! `
`This flimsy body is not enough! I'm borrowing yours!! `
`It's been too long since I've shown you real magic! `
`Let my body return to the land of the living for just a moment!" `
`"Huh? `
`Ah, ......!" `
`A shiver ran up my whole body like an electric shock. `
`From that moment onwards, ...I couldn't move any part of my body by my own will. `
`Like a moment of shock after a blackout, `
`I could do nothing but accept the fact that I had lost control over myself... `
`All of the cells throughout my body felt tingly. `
`...It felt as though my body had been transformed into someone else's. `
`...I realized that the witch {f:5:Beatrice} was using my body as a vessel to revive for a short period of time... `
`"...Hmm, very nice. `
`That ticklish feeling of the air on my skin... Having a body is simply wonderful!" `
`...Wh-What are you trying to do?! `
`Please, don't do anything mean... `
`This time, everything was backwards. `
`My words were spoken inside my heart. `
`And the witch's voice was coming out of my mouth...! `
`"Fear not. `
`I'll give your body back soon enough. `
`I just need to teach her a lesson with a little prank. `
`I won't do anything foolish that might earn you her suspicion...! `
`Come, try and remember. `
`Where have you been sleeping?!" `
`Everything went completely white, and my mind stopped. `
`Once again, that tingling sensation slid up my body. `
`I could feel it all gather in the fingers of both of my hands...and come out the tips of my fingers. `
`It was an unfathomable, `
`indescribable, `
`...unknown sensation. `
`My head went blank, and I couldn't think at all. `
`I could do nothing but abandon my soul to the sensation. `
`I finally understood. `
`This is... `
`what it's like... `
`to use magic... `
`"Come, try and remember. `
`Where have you been sleeping...?" `
`My finger was moved like a puppet's...and danced around as though I was conducting music. `
`I never knew that having my body move without my control could be so exciting... `
`When Beato lifted my finger as if a string was attached to it, `
`the key ring lying on the bed stood on end. `
`...Belne-san...didn't notice. `
`...Neither did Asne-san. `
`They were fully occupied by their happy chat as they cleaned the room... `
`I doubt that either of them would have dreamed that a witch was right behind them, `
`readying herself to use magic. `
`They probably couldn't even imagine... `
`...the key ring doing a little dance right behind their backs. `
`It was like a cartoon fairy tale I'd seen once as a kid. `
`The happy way the keys danced and spun made it look as though they had a will of their own. `
`I could feel the fun of making those keys dance with my fingers wash over me... `
`Yes, this is...pleasure... `
`As I powerlessly watched the witch control me, `
`...I couldn't help but surrender myself to this new joy called magic... `
`"Whoops, that won't do. `
`If the whole ring disappears, my friend will be suspected again. `
`...All we need... `
`yes, we just need the key to this room to disappear." `
`Beato controlled my fingers, controlling the magic. `
`...And thereby controlling the keys. `
`The key ring slumped down on the bed, `
`...and then just the mansion's master key stood on end. `
`"Well now, what shall I do with this? `
`...Merely erasing it would be quite boring. `
`So, ......*cackle*cackle*! `
`Why don't I throw it into her locker?! `
`That will give my friend, who's been working here with her the whole time, a splendid alibi!" `
`"Come, try and remember. `
`Where have you been sleeping?! `
`Yes, it was a warm, dark place..." `
`"The inside of Belne's locker!! `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!" `
`When Beato snapped her fingers, the key burst and became a gold butterfly. `
`...A gold butterfly...? `
`I see, it's gold because she's the Golden Witch, who gave the Master all of his gold. `
`And butterflies are scared of spiderwebs. `
`...So, it's a gold...butterfly. `
`The minions of the witch {f:5:Beatrice}...are gold butterflies... `
`After flitting into the air, it burst into a shower of gold sparks and disappeared. `
`And then, the vanished key...was in Belne-san's locker... `
`Though it was far away, in a changing room locker, I could tell exactly how it had happened. `
`It wasn't by sight or by touch. `
`It was by some other sense inside my heart, which couldn't be explained by the five senses. `
`A completely new sensation that I'd never felt before. `
`It was the completely alien concept...called magic. `
`A completely unknown pleasure that left me in a trance. `
`"...That's enough, my friend. `
`I'll give this body back to you..." `
`Nng, ......ah... `
`"............" `
`It felt as though I had been spinning through space... `
`until gravity suddenly came back and threw me to the ground. `
`Like when you're having a great dream, but you wake up suddenly, `
`...and all you remember about the dream was that it was fun. `
`...That sort of lonely feeling. `
`Though Beato had been borrowing my body, it was my own body that used magic. `
`I could still feel that sensation in my hands. `
`The key ring over there had danced along with the movements of my fingers. `
`No, that's not quite it. `
`The key ring and my fingers had danced together. `
`That fun, that excitement... `
`...still tingled slightly in my hands... `
`"Whoops, that was close." `
`Saying this, Belne-san suddenly turned around and picked up the key ring she had thrown down on the bed. `
`She must have realized that I was staring at it. `
`"Almost had Yasu complain that I shouldn't leave keys lying about like this. `
`I'd never put something down and forget about it." `
`With a grin, she put the key back into her pocket. `
`However, she still hadn't noticed. `
`She probably couldn't even imagine... `
`...that just a single key had vanished while her back was turned for a second... `
`It's not easy for a Human to do things like that. `
`...But, with magic... `
`With just a little dance of the keys and a butterfly popping, ...it had disappeared. `
`"Okay, fingertip inspection! `
`Bed, okay. `
`Curtains, okay!" `
`"Tools, okay. `
`And keys too! `
`See? `
`Nothing wrong, right?" `
`"Y-Yes, that's good... `
`Then let's go on to the next room. `
`...Ah, ...Belne-san, `
`...could you lock up this room for me?" `
`"Hmm? `
`Suuure." `
`...Did Belne-san's key... `
`...really disappear by magic? `
`Was that fun magic just a daydream I had...? `
`I was so scared of that being true...that I tested it. `
`"...... `
`......Huh...?" `
`"What's wrong? `
`Why're you taking so long?" `
`"...Huh? `
`...Huh? Huh?? `
`...Wait, are you kidding me?" `
`"What's wrong...?" `
`"...It's not this one. `
`...And it isn't this one. `
`...Huh? `
`What the...?" `
`"What is it? `
`Do you want me to lock it?" `
`"I-I don't get it. `
`What's going on? `
`...My master key's gone. `
`Just my master key is gone. `
`Wh-Why...?! `
`This ring's so stiff... There's no way it'd come off...!" `
`I could faintly feel that tingling sensation... `
`...run across my fingers again... `
`That night. `
`...As I gazed at the ceiling from the bed in my dorm room, `
`...I looked at my hands. `
`I couldn't sleep. `
`The excitement from the time those keys danced was still there in my fingers... `
`Is this... `
`how {f:5:Beatrice}... `
`how witches... `
`always feel? `
`...I have a friend who's a witch, called {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`She always used to pull pranks on me with her strange magic. `
`Because I saw this all the time, `
`......I thought I knew what magic was. `
`But today... `
`...She had possessed my body and used magic with it. `
`The sensation of magic that I finally felt at that time...still held my heart entranced. `
`It was a completely unknown pleasure. `
`After all... `
`By moving my fingertips, `
`......I could make the key dance as I wished. `
`It was a strange, strange miracle of magic, something Humans could not do. `
`I still couldn't let go of that excitement... `
`............ `
`"......Shannon, `
`......are you awake...?" `
`"...... `
`...What is it?" `
`Shannon was still awake. `
`Shannon is always early to bed, early to rise. `
`By getting to bed early, all of her weariness disappears by the next day. `
`...She lives a model life, one that all servants should respect and admire. `
`...If I want to become a loved, respected servant like Shannon, `
`...I'll need to act that way too. `
`However, ...I wasn't confident that I could do that anymore. `
`"I guess... `
`...I can't become like you after all." `
`"...What do you mean? `
`This is a bit abrupt." `
`"You were my ideal. `
`Always." `
`"...Yeah." `
`"Everyone in the Fukuin House loves you and is kind to you. `
`...Since you always played with me, you're the only friend I've ever had. `
`And you're also a wonderful servant, who can carry out any task in the Ushiromiya mansion both flawlessly and gracefully. `
`You were the target I longed to reach. `
`...That's...what you were to me." `
`"Yeah. `
`...Let's give it our all together. `
`As they say, perseverance prevails. `
`Everyone will grow to acknowledge you more and more. `
`So let's aim to become wonderful servants together." `
`"...... `
`...I'm...gonna stop being a servant." `
`"...Huh?" `
`"Instead of a servant, `
`...I'd rather be a witch." `
`"Wh-What do you mean `
`by witch...?" `
`"I did...and still do... `
`wish I could be a servant loved and relied upon by everybody. `
`...But right now, `
`I want to be a witch... `
`even more." `
`"Well, that's... `
`...ummm... `
`...huh...?" `
`Shannon was confused. `
`It was hardly surprising. `
`...All this about quitting as a servant was at least understandable. `
`But she didn't know how to answer after hearing that her roommate wanted to become a witch... `
`"A witch. `
`{f:5:Beatrice}. `
`...You see, today, {f:5:Beatrice} possessed me and used my body to do magic. `
`That unknown world felt so...thrilling. `
`It was much more thrilling when I learned that I'd been selected as an Ushiromiya family servant. `
`It was like learning about a new world. `
`...As though I'd been living in a world of darkness all my life and thought I knew what the world was like, `
`then finally learned what light was and saw the world for the first time. `
`It was...joy. `
`...Excitement." `
`Beato had only used my fingers, made a key ring dance, `
`and turned a key into a butterfly before hiding it in a locker. `
`But I'd understood it with my body. `
`If I'd moved my fingers a different way, the ring could've flown into the air instead of just dancing, `
`and I could've turned it into a scurrying lizard instead of a butterfly. ...I could've done anything. `
`True, {f:5:Beatrice}'s magical power was still weak. `
`It had all happened in the little world behind the backs of the servants, who were filled with anti-magic toxin. `
`However, inside that tiny, short-lived world, I could do anything at all. `
`Beato just happened to settle on making them dance and turning the key into a butterfly. `
`But if she'd wanted to, she could've done anything else! `
`The endless sensation of that free, unrestricted power... `
`I could still feel it in my fingertips. `
`Could it be that, along with that sensation, a fragment of that magical power might also remain...? `
`I can tell. `
`It's still there. `
`...There's still just a bit of it there, along with that sensation. `
`I can do it. `
`...I can still...do it... `
`"......Ah..." `
`A single spot of golden light suddenly lit up in this dark room. `
`It was right between my clasped hands. `
`When I slowly opened them, `
`...I could see a single dot that sparkled gold. `
`"What... `
`...is... `
`...?" `
`Shannon didn't know what the light meant. `
`How could light appear from the palm of my hands? `
`And yet, even with this miracle right in front of her, `
`...she couldn't understand what it was. `
`She just sat there with her mouth open in disbelief. `
`However, to me, `
`...this was just the return of that bit of sensation in my fingertips. `
`The golden dot... `
`spread out... `
`...and became a small, gold butterfly. `
`It flapped its wings and scattered gold sparks about like a cartoon fairy. `
`To Shannon, it probably just looked as though a gold butterfly was flapping its wings. `
`...Of course, that alone was a miracle that she could hardly grasp. `
`But to me, it was like a remote-control plane in the shape of a butterfly. `
`I could control that gold butterfly however I wanted. `
`Not clumsily with threads. `
`...I could make it flap, dance, play through the air as I wished. `
`I was taking a walk through the air as that little butterfly. `
`The golden glint of it pierced the darkness of the small room as it danced about freely. `
`...It was an entrancing pleasure. `
`...However, that sensation in my fingers began to weaken. `
`I could tell that the few magic butterfly scales left in my fingers were going away. `
`Finally, the gold butterfly flashed and turned to dust like a firework run out of juice, `
`falling down and disappearing without a trace... `
`"Wh-What on earth just happened...?" `
`"This is magic. `
`...It's really fun." `
`"...M-Magic......" `
`"Yeah. `
`Magic. `
`...There was still some magic left in my fingers, so I was able to use it. `
`...But if I became a real witch, ...I'll be able to use it whenever and however I want...to do anything. `
`Now that I've learned how fun this can be, `
`I don't want to go back to being Human. `
`Being a servant is just too boring. `
`So, ...I'm going to become a witch." `
`"B-Become a witch...? `
`...W-Wait...!" `
`"I've already made my decision, Shannon. `
`It's been fun. `
`I'll give you this room. `
`You can use it by yourself. `
`Later. `
`Goodbye." `
`"W-Wait...!!" `
`As Shannon called out repeatedly for me to wait, ...a massive planetarium swallowed me up. `
`In the sea of the pitch-black starry sky, I was alone. `
`I...we...are alone here. `
`"I'm done acting the part of the servant. `
`......I'm going to...modify this world." `
`"...Indeed. `
`Understood. `
`In that case, what will you do?" `
`"Being a wonderful servant like Shannon wouldn't be bad. `
`...But now that I know how fun it is to be a witch, that feels like a boring dream. `
`I can't go back anymore." `
`"What will happen to Shannon?" `
`"...Shannon can just be Shannon, and stay as a respected servant. `
`She'll stay the same. `
`But from now on, it won't be the two of us together, but her alone." `
`"Farewells are sudden, is that not the phrase? `
`...Very well. `
`Being fickle makes life more entertaining. `
`And what of you?" `
`"I want to become a witch. `
`I want to become Beato." `
`"But I am already {f:5:Beatrice}." `
`"You'll still be a witch and my friend. `
`I'm modifying the world so that Beato is me." `
`"So, I'll be a witch who is a friend of {f:5:Beatrice}?" `
`"Pretty much. `
`So, from now on, you're a different witch." `
`"I understand. `
`Then, what will be my new name?" `
`"...... `
`I'll put that on hold until I can think of one. `
`You'll be nameless for a while. `
`Sorry about the trouble." `
`"Not at all, not at all. `
`This is my precious name we're talking about. `
`You had better take your time and think carefully about it. `
`*cackle*." `
`"You've been {f:5:Beatrice}'s friend since she was young and couldn't use magic yet. `
`When we first met each other, you'd always hide my things and make fun of me." `
`"I see. `
`And when {f:5:Beatrice} finally learns the ways of magic, I become a friend on an equal footing with her. `
`Perhaps that would make me a sort of big sister to you." `
`"Yeah, that sounds nice. `
`...What are we going to do about how we talk?" `
`"{f:5:Beatrice}'s voice is that of a woman of high station. `
`Shall I give that to you as well?" `
`"Yeah. `
`I'll inherit the way she talks." `
`"Indeed, I comprehend. `
`...Or perhaps I shouldn't say it like that. `
`...I'll need to find a good way to sound like {f:5:Beatrice}'s big sister-like witch friend." `
`"Yeah. `
`...Or should it be... `
`...indeed." `
`"Heheheheheh. `
`Now there's a nice, dignified voice." `
`"Okay, then how about...no, wait. `
`Then what of my appearance?" `
`"Good point. `
`I've got a sort of blood-red witch look. `
`Why not choose a different color for yourself?" `
`"...When {f:5:Beatrice} wanders the mansion at night, she is often seen dressed in white." `
`"Yes, I suppose ghosts are classically white." `
`"A witch... `
`...in a white dress... `
`...Let's try putting it all together." `
`I need a different look than the witch in the demon-red dress. `
`A white, noble witch. `
`...Unlike the time with the red witch, I'm thinking about my own look now, `
`...so I'd like to make it beautiful and cute if I can. `
`A white dress. `
`A noble look. `
`Like one of noble blood, but with a dark, sarcastic streak... `
`No, she's like a tomboy princess, so her voice is a mix of formality and rudeness. `
`Then the dress should be the exact opposite, to make a nice contrast... `
`"...... `
`...Then what of this form?" `
`"Is this the form of the new {f:5:Beatrice}?!" `
`"How beautiful! `
`Just like a noble princess!" `
`"Hmmm... `
`...I've taken a liking to this form. `
`This will be quite satisfactory." `
`"...Not bad. `
`You look great, Beato." `
`"Hmm. I like it. `
`I truly do like this form..." `
`"Now, if you can keep this up and give me a wonderful name, that'd be great. `
`If I have to go around nameless for too long, I'll get all sulky." `
`"Fear not, I shall find you a splendid name! `
`But first, there is something I must consider. What shall be the form of my magic?!" `
`"Hiding objects and transporting them instantaneously is your theme. `
`So, I must think of my own particular theme of magic. `
`...When I use magic, gold butterflies will flit about. `
`I'm not backing down on that part...!" `
`"*giggle* Perfect. `
`That really would make you a Golden Witch. `
`...Then the weaknesses such as spiderwebs and the sacred mirror in the shrine will also go to you?" `
`"Indeed. `
`Even an all-powerful witch needs a few small weaknesses to keep things interesting. `
`Then let us do it like so. `
`If I touch a spiderweb, it will burn me." `
`Silently, a silvery spider dropped down vertically. `
`Beato, now in her new form, lightly touched the silver spiderweb that trailed out behind it. `
`As she did, ...there was a faint sound of flesh burning, and a thin burn was left across her fingers. `
`{f:5:Beatrice} can't stand spiderwebs. `
`That was one of the weaknesses of the evil spirits Kumasawa-san spoke of. `
`Since the witch {f:5:Beatrice} had revived thanks to the power of those evil spirits, `
`she had also inherited their weaknesses. `
`Therefore, sacred mirrors are another one of my weaknesses. `
`...However, that sacred mirror in the shrine isn't too likely to appear in front of me often. `
`That's not so fun. `
`"...Then, while mirrors with sacred power will obviously be a weakness, let us make mirrors themselves a weakness too." `
`"You often hear that mirrors have magical powers. `
`Isn't that nice? `
`Sounds just like a witch." `
`"If I look at a mirror, it feels as though my magical power is being sucked out, so I shall try to avoid them. `
`Indeed, that could be quite amusing." `
`...If I really think about it, `
`I'm bad with mirrors whether I make that rule or not. `
`No matter who I want or strive to be, `
`...the only face that will ever show in a mirror... `
`is the heartlessly pathetic and realistic face of Yasu. `
`Mirrors, which always force me to face my shabby reality, are something I always want to avoid. `
`That's right. `
`...I hate mirrors. `
`...I don't want `
`to see `
`my pitiful self. `
`"You don't need to decide everything at once. `
`It's fun to build up a world one little bit at a time." `
`"True. `
`I understand. `
`I shall enjoy life as a witch as I slowly expand my world." `
`"That tiny, dark room is no place for you to sleep now." `
`"Indeed. `
`I am the Golden Witch! `
`I am the ruler of Rokkenjima's night, and the nighttime mansion belongs to me. `
`That is where I should make my home, is it not?" `
`"A room for {f:5:Beatrice}? `
`Haha, isn't it obvious?!" `
`"Yeah, that's right! `
`That wonderful room on the second floor of the mansion..." `
`"The VIP room of the witch just has to be {f:5:Beatrice}'s room!" `
`"Oh, that's right. `
`From this evening forward, that room in the nighttime mansion shall be my dwelling place...! `
`Why didn't I think of that myself, hahaha, hehahahahahahahaha...!!" `
`"Then let's go, Beato. `
`If we're going to drink tea together, we'll need a much better room than that cramped one." `
`"Indeed. `
`That room is too crude for entertaining friends and serving tea. `
`We shall change rooms. `
`Let us go, my friend...!" `
`"...So, this is goodbye to Shannon." `
`When I looked at my feet, ...I could see my own dorm room far beneath me. `
`I could see Shannon, who had dashed up to the bed I lay on and had been saying "wait" at the moment time froze. `
`She was as rigid as a doll. `
`Looking down at it from this height, it really did look like a small dollhouse... `
`"So long, Shannon. `
`...The days I spent as a Human, with you as a goal and a constant comfort, were truly fun. `
`...If I had never learned the joys of magic and awakened as a witch, `
`everything would doubtless have remained as it was." `
`...I was your only close friend too, wasn't I? `
`Please forgive me for erasing that friend so suddenly. `
`As a parting gift, ...I will erase "me" from your world. `
`Starting now, this will not be a two-person room. `
`It will be a single-person room, with just you in it. `
`I hope you continue to strive for your ideal and try to become a kind, `
`reliable servant loved by everyone. `
`Yasu, the stupid, clumsy servant who lost things all the time, ...doesn't exist anymore. `
`So long, Shannon. `
`When I mature as the witch {f:5:Beatrice} and stride through the nighttime mansion where I will, `
`...I may bump into you as you do your nighttime rounds. `
`However, when I meet you again, `
`it will not be a reunion. `
`It will be our first meeting. `
`After all, though you have heard the rumors of the witch {f:5:Beatrice}, you have never met her... `
`So long, Shannon. `
`Let us meet again sometime and spin up some fun tale...... `
`"Wait...!! `
`Wai... `
`...t... `
`... `
`............" `
`............ `
`......What... `
`was I doing...? `
`Was I...talking in my sleep...? `
`Apparently, I had gotten out of bed, stretched my hand out towards it, `
`...and said "wait". `
`This isn't the first time I've woken up to find myself saying something strange, but... `
`...I don't remember ever waking up to find myself out of bed and standing up. `
`Could this be what they call...sleepwalking...? `
`Am I just tired...? `
`...Gotta sleep. `
`Gotta get back to sleep. `
`I turned around to face my bed. `
`............? `
`My bed wasn't there. `
`There was no bed in this room except the one I had just turned my back on. `
`If I'm the only one in this room, and the only bed is the one behind me, `
`...that must mean it's my bed. `
`...That feels wrong, for some reason. `
`The bed sheets are all disarranged, as though someone had slipped out of them. `
`Who did...? `
`This is a single-person room with me in it, right? `
`So, that there is my bed, and the traces of someone crawling out... `
`mean that I was just sleeping there until a second ago...? `
`...But, for some reason... `
`that bed... `
`doesn't feel like my bed. `
`However, though all the other kids shared rooms, I, Shannon, was given a single-person room. `
`So, there's only one bed. `
`And it must be mine. `
`............ `
`"...Am I just... `
`...tired?" `
`...I wonder. `
`I must just be half-asleep. `
`School starts early tomorrow morning. `
`And, when school ends, I want to go to the mansion, help out with some work, `
`and talk to Kumasawa-san about the mystery novel I just read. `
`"Time to sleep. `
`I'm probably just so worn out that I'm imagining things. `
`...Goodnight, Shannon. `
`Just crawl in bed and close your eyes, `
`...and you won't have to think about anything complicated..." `
`I went back into my bed. `
`It felt a bit uncomfortable to crawl into a bed that wasn't mine. `
`Still, it might just be because I'm getting so sleepy, but it's starting to feel as though this is my bed after all. `
`...I'm just half-asleep... `
`I am...Shannon. `
`A lonely servant. `
`I mess up from time to time, `
`...but I want to become a kind servant whom everyone loves... `
`......Goodnight, `
`...me... `
`Oh, I am one yet many. `
`I've had enough of playing the servant. `
`I've had enough of being Human! `
`From this night forth, I am {f:5:Beatrice}! `
`The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}, who has lived for a thousand years! `
`Praise me, servants. `
`Have fear when you are chosen for the night shift! `
`In the nighttime mansion, everything is mine, for that is my time...! `
`Oh, I am one yet many! `
`Yes, let our world swallow up everything. `
`It is like the raging seas! `
`Well now, let us drink the mysterious moon dry tonight, with this Human book as a side dish! `
`You call this a mystery? `
`You call this a closed room? `
`You call this "a crime impossible for Humans"? `
`Don't make me laugh! `
`With all these holes and weak points, you call this a crime impossible for Humans?! `
`Is there no splendid closed room magic that can do my name justice? `
`No, not here, not here, not there, not there either...all of them pathetic! `
`It's enough to make one giggle, but now I'm not sure which is the side dish, the moon or the book! `
`If I get tired of mystery, I can change myself into a butterfly! `
`I can flit about the island, the mansion, the vast forest at will. `
`I'll follow those cowardly servants as they do their nighttime rounds, `
`and when they check to see that a window is locked, `
`they'll see me laughing at them in the reflection on the glass! `
`I can be fickle, and do as I please! `
`Pranks at night should be a lot of fun. `
`Okay, I've decided. Let's play like that starting tonight! `
`*cackle*cackle* How amusing! `
`What amusement this night shall bring! `
`In the world of witches, the only limits to your fun are the limits of your imagination! `
`My imagination shall become the source of my magical power! `
`Splendid, it shall all be so fun! `
`I shall expand it infinitely. `
`And let it swallow the whole island. `
`The island's night will be all mine!! `
`Oh, how refined and pleasant are the days of a witch! `
`Oh, I am one yet many! `
`Kihahahahahahhha, hyahhaha!! `
`Here's to the wonderful world of witches!! `
