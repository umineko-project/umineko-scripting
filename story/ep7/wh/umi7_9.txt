`"......Listen. `
`I am one yet many. `
`What I speak is our tale. `
`However, this is a small world, sealed by glass and cork, with no one to hear. `
`None shall lay eyes upon it, and my entire tale shall be sealed away, `
`set adrift in the sea of my heart until it disappears amongst the seaweed..." `
`"Ah, where is this place?! `
`And who am I?!" `
`"Then let me ask! `
`Where do you want it to be? Who do you want to be?!" `
`"Any place, so long as it will wrap itself around me gently! `
`Anyone, so long as I am treated kindly!" `
`"Yes, for us...!" `
`"For us...!" `
`""Where and who we are hardly matter!!"" `
`"Correct. `
`For us, it's such a trivial matter. `
`At least until that day comes to pass. `
`Why must we be thrown in the path of a new fate? `
`Fate's pronouncement was sudden and abrupt." `
`"It wasn't the fate I'd wished for." `
`"But it did make your heart pound...!" `
`"Where will the new fate take me?!" `
`"It doesn't matter where!" `
`""So long as that place is kind to us...!!"" `
`"When we were brought to the temporary dwelling where sad, parentless children gather, `
`was that a sign of God's salvation, or a lure into the demon's game where the new fate would torment us? `
`We have no way of knowing." `
`"And yet, we want to believe. `
`We want to believe it was God's salvation sent to us, a sign of the good news, the {ruby:fukuin:Gospel}." `
`"But why me? `
`I have no religion!" `
`"Then it wasn't the Gospel, but a demon's lure!" `
`"And yet, we cannot go against fate. `
`Oh, I am one yet many. `
`I pray that the new fate brings us blessings. `
`The time is 1976 AD, in April. `
`At a time still too cool to be called spring. `
`In a strange new land, we were tormented by the same stale air and drafts..." `
`"Those are the family rules. `
`They may be strict, but I believe that the discipline you learn in this house will serve you well in the future." `
`"""Yes, Madam.""" `
`The servants who would start working this April all called out in unison. `
`The rules of the Ushiromiya family are no more or less strict than those of the Fukuin House. `
`However, we get paid a lot of money here. `
`They also give us a lot of help in finding our next job. `
`We work for the Ushiromiya family, store up money, use their influence to get a job at a good company, and start on a new, happy life. `
`...That was the dream, and it was a very realistic one, held by all of us at the Fukuin House. `
`However, not everyone can become an Ushiromiya family servant. `
`Only kids with a record of exemplary conduct and good grades are recommended. `
`So, all of the kids who want to be sure of leaving the Fukuin House to live a happy life are feverishly devoted to their studies... `
`"That's enough for today. `
`Tomorrow, you start early. `
`Make sure the lights are all out at the appropriate time. `
`That is all." `
`"""Yes, Madam. `
`Thank you very much.""" `
`After bowing until Natsuhi was no longer in sight, `
`the new servants all followed the lead of one of the more experienced servants and raised their heads. `
`"Okay, we're done for the day. `
`Starting tomorrow, you'll be following your shift schedule. `
`The Madam is very strict about time. `
`If any of you sleep in, it'll be my responsibility. `
`So if you do, I'll kick you awake. `
`Got it?!" `
`Of course, this experienced servant was one of the older girls from the Fukuin House. `
`She's been here for two years, apparently. `
`That's probably why all the other new servants, who are older than me, seem to know her well. `
`"That Madam looks so strict." "Dang, I'm tired." "*giggle*giggle*." `
`"...By the way, who exactly is this kid? `
`Why were you chosen to be a servant?" `
`The older servant pointed at me and asked the room at large, a dubious look on her face. `
`It's no surprise, really. `
`Most of us become servants when we graduate middle school or high school. `
`But I'm just starting elementary school. `
`The others will be working as servants every day of the week, according to their standard shift schedule. `
`However, on weekdays, I was going to go to the elementary school on Niijima with Milady, `
`only working on weekends and when I had free time. `
`It was an exception among exceptions, something that had never happened before. `
`...It was clear at a glance that the others, who had obtained their positions after a rigorous selection process, `
`didn't like the fact that I was here too. `
`"...Both Madam and Genji-sama have told me that you are to put your studies first. `
`But you're still getting paid. `
`Doesn't make any sense." `
`If you're going to talk behind someone's back, at least do it behind them. `
`She didn't even try to hide her discontent. `
`"Is this kid really that smart? `
`A child prodigy, or something?" `
`"I never heard anything about that." `
`"Well, that kid supposedly gets sick easily and is kept isolated most of the time. A total outsider to the rest of us, even back at the House." `
`"...Now that you're here, you're part of the collective responsibility system. `
`If you screw up, it's the same as everyone from the Fukuin House screwing up. `
`Make sure you don't, okay?" `
`I nodded weakly. `
`...I'd never been threatened by someone this much older than me, and I was very frightened. `
`"Don't worry. `
`I'll be there with you. `
`Let's give it our all together, `
`okay?" `
`Shannon smiled at me as she spoke... `
`"Isn't Shannon scared too? `
`This house looks pretty strict...!" `
`"Nah, there's nothing scary about it. `
`You just thought it was scary, so it got scary." `
`"Then if I thought it was fun, would it get fun?!" `
`"Yeah, it would. `
`So here too, let's give it our all with a smile." `
`"...Shannon was my only friend in the Fukuin House. `
`She was confident and popular. `
`The complete opposite of me. `
`I was embarrassingly dull-witted, and no one wanted to be my friend." `
`"I would never have made it through those days in the Fukuin House had it not been for her encouragement. `
`...So, I would probably make it through here too, with her by my side." `
`"Well, isn't it about time we got ready for bed? `
`I've got work early tomorrow morning, but you have a different job." `
`"That's right. Unlike everyone else, I have to go to school. `
`When I spend the night on Rokkenjima, I have to get ready for school and wait for Milady at the dock." `
`"Milady looks like an energetic person. `
`I hope you get along well!" `
`"D-Do you think I will...? `
`I'm so scared of school, so nervous...!" `
`"...I had grown used to life in the Fukuin House, so the more relaxed rules at school made life easy. `
`But until I grew used to it, everything was new, and everything made me nervous." `
`My new life on Rokkenjima probably deserves an explanation. `
`It was completely different from the comfortable yet stagnant life I'd lived at the Fukuin House. `
`In addition to the time I spent as a servant to the Ushiromiya family on Rokkenjima, I also traveled to the elementary school on Niijima on school days. `
`It was the start of a time that was both rushed and busy, with hardly a moment to relax. `
`Unlike the time I spent at the Fukuin House, I didn't get to sleep in the same bed every day. `
`Half of the week, I slept in the servant waiting room in the Rokkenjima mansion. `
`I would return from school with Milady, go to the mansion, and work there as a servant. `
`I would then stay the night and go to school with Milady again the next day. `
`When I didn't have work, I would return to the dormitory on Niijima, where I could have some time to myself in the room that I was assigned to. `
`There was an adult dorm mother who strictly controlled mealtimes and lights-out, `
`but I was already used to that sort of life, so it wasn't hard for me. `
`The rooms were slightly larger than average and housed three people each. `
`However, either because of the number of people or some lucky chance, I was not given a three-person room. `
`"Looks like we'll share a dorm room too." `
`With Shannon by my side, I felt like I'd be able to manage well enough... `
`"Correct. `
`Every year, new servants came from the Fukuin House, replacing some of the old ones." `
`"It was something Father worked out with the House all on his own. `
`The rest of us weren't allowed to meddle." `
`"And after all, our family would strictly discipline these children without families and support them on their path to adulthood, `
`which I always viewed as the rich Ushiromiya family fulfilling its obligations to society." `
`"What sort of kids came to serve the Ushiromiya family?" `
`"I'm sure they were serious, `
`cute kids of irreproachable conduct!" `
`"It seemed to me that there were a lot of glaring hyenas among them." `
`"Let us say they had high ambitions. `
`They were pitiable children without families. `
`All were determined to use this rare opportunity to launch their careers, so that they could take control of their lives." `
`"Did all of them have to balance school and servant work?" `
`"That must be tough! `
`You wouldn't be able to get much work done!" `
`"Before that child, there were no cases of a servant going to school while they worked." `
`"To be honest, I was fairly surprised when that kid first came to greet me. `
`So obviously young. `
`The others were all around 16 or 18 years old, but that kid alone looked 10 years younger." `
`"That one extraordinarily young servant came to the family mainly for experience, `
`so not much was expected of that child's ability as a servant." `
`"Indeed. `
`You certainly couldn't rely on that kid as much as you could an adult, seasoned servant." `
`"To think that we would accept a child who hadn't even started school... `
`No knowledge of housework, no practical experience, and not even finished with mandatory education. `
`I don't know what Father was thinking, but I always thought there was something clearly odd about it." `
`"I spoke to Father about it. `
`I asked if it might be better to wait for this servant to graduate middle school before starting here." `
`"And what did Kinzo say?" `
`"Come on, we all know what he said." `
`""Oooooh, {f:5:Beatriiiiice}!!"" `
`"Hahaha... `
`By that time, he was already a complete shut-in inside his study, obsessed with the occult. `
`If you tried to talk to him when he didn't want you to, he'd yell and tell you to stop interrupting "the journey of his mind"." `
`"And Father's decisions are absolute. `
`...However, the case of this particular child just didn't make sense." `
`"I even asked the Fukuin House about it. `
`They said to ask Genji-san. `
`I then asked Genji-san, and he said to ask the Master." `
`"And then you asked the Master, and he said "{f:5:Beatriiiiice}"!" `
`"Ahahahaha! `
`No one knows the truth!" `
`"Jessica was the only child on the island. `
`The servants would often play with my daughter, but she wanted a friend of her own age. `
`Someone she could play with at home, as well as at school." `
`"...I began to think that Father employed this servant out of pity for Jessica. `
`...But if that were the case, why wouldn't he talk to us about it beforehand? `
`We should be the ones to decide which friends are suitable for our daughter." `
`"Scaaary! Ahahahahaha!" `
`"Natsuhi must've really hated taking her kid out in public!" `
`"We should probably view this as an arrangement planned by Genji." `
`"...Probably. `
`...Genji-san knew that the "me" in this world carried Grandfather's blood, `
`so he probably arranged for that "me" to be summoned to Rokkenjima." `
`"Are you feeling okay now?" `
`"...It was a really big shock, that's all. `
`...I just feel a bit dizzy now." `
`"In this world, you're the Successor. `
`But if we move to a different world, you're a servant...or maybe a witch. `
`...You do have a troubled fate." `
`"No kidding... `
`I don't regret learning about it, but if I could forget it now, I would." `
`"*giggle* Isn't it interesting? `
`Even though you're a servant, you're actually an illegitimate child of the Head... `
`Isn't that romantic, like some fairy tale?" `
`"...Romantic? `
`...Considering how Mom must have felt, I'm not sure what to think." `
`"Heheheh, true. `
`In Natsuhi's eyes, the Lion of this world is nothing more than the baby she hated and was forced to raise. `
`And in this world, she rejected that child. `
`...Natsuhi must adore her natural child Jessica a bunch more. `
`A baby that doesn't share your blood is nothing more than a dirty, lukewarm sack of filth." `
`"Have some decency. `
`Next time, I'll be the one pinching your butt." `
`"...Thank you, Will. `
`...I think I understand, more or less. `
`And that's exactly why I need to be grateful to my mother. `
`She's raised me fairly all these years." `
`"Though at a probability so low it'd take a miracle to happen. `
`...Animals are always brutal towards children that don't carry their blood. `
`Lions do that too, don't they? ...*giggle*giggle*." `
`"We can probably sketch out Genji's line of thinking. `
`...The Lion of this world is a true, blood-related member of the Ushiromiya Family. `
`He must have wanted to let that child live on Rokkenjima somehow. `
`However, it wasn't as though he could just suddenly show up with Lion and tell everyone who this was." `
`"...Yeah. `
`Maybe he wanted me to live on the island until I was used to it, and then reveal everything when the chance presented itself." `
`"However, the Lion of this world was not given special treatment. `
`The silver ring doesn't actually exist." `
`"I wonder if that means Grandfather never heard about me." `
`"That might mean that Genji never found a good opportunity `
`to reveal the truth..." `
`"Genji must have wanted to tell the truth one day, `
`to tell that the orphan of Kinzo's beloved Beatrice was still alive. `
`However, that was not an easy thing to say." `
`"Why wasn't it easy?!" `
`"Dummy, what would happen if Natsuhi found out?!" `
`"Oh, right, if Lion suddenly appeared, Jessica wouldn't be the Successor anymore!" `
`Strictly speaking, Jessica wasn't the Successor, but since she'd be able to select the future Successor, it all came to the same thing. `
`"The more one learns, the less simple this tale becomes. `
`There were some who celebrated my birth, and some who did not. `
`...Genji could only wait in silence for the proper day to reveal it all." `
`"Was it a tale hidden only within Genji's heart?" `
`"Lion and Kinzo and Natsuhi and Krauss and Jessica and everyone else! `
`None of them knew this tale!" `
`"Thus, the curtains slowly rise on this curious tale in the year 1976. `
`Oh, I am one yet many. `
`Why must fate abandon us and continue on its merry way...?" `
`People only found the young servant strange for the first month. `
`Natsuhi and Krauss's protests came to naught. `
`After all, there was no actual harm in it. `
`So why not indulge Kinzo's whim...? `
`Eventually, everyone grew accustomed...and began to accept this slightly abnormal everyday life. `
`"However, it was not so for the other Fukuin servants, who were always close by and who believed that everyone should be treated equally. `
`Their small bits of discontent over my special treatment began to accumulate as time went on..." `
`"Nice work, Sawachii. `
`How'd it go today?" `
`"Madam was really pissed off. `
`She was, like, running her finger across the windowsills!" `
`"Yeah, and getting on Tadacchi's case for cleaning slow. `
`Come on, give us a break!" `
`All of the kids in the Fukuin House are supposed to treat each other as family. `
`Because of this, everyone hides their original names and uses their new "blessed names". `
`Maybe because the {p:0:音} character is in the word "Fukuin", `
`that character is almost always combined with at least one character from the child's original name to make their new name. `
`...Still, just giving a person a new name doesn't mean they'll accept it so easily. `
`Boys and girls, who have lived in isolation and through various trials, `
`sometimes feel as though their real first and last names are a bond that's worth holding onto. `
`So, most of the Fukuin children hate their "{p:0:音}" names, calling each other by nicknames based on their original names. `
`Of course, that's only done privately. `
`When in the presence of the House Director or other important people, only the "blessed names" are used. `
`On the job, the "blessed names" are used. `
`And off the job, informal nicknames are used. `
`Everyone's very used to living with two names like this, so they're all comfortable with how the system works. `
`"Whoo, you stink. `
`Go take a shower." `
`"Dang, why's it so cramped in here? `
`Can't they get a bigger dorm if they have that huge mansion?" `
`"Hey, Garashi-saaan. `
`Why's Yasu the only one who isn't in a three-person room?" `
`By "Yasu", they probably mean me. `
`I can't remember my parents at all, since they were gone as far back as my memory goes, ...but I was given the last name "Yasuda" ({p:0:安田}). `
`And, apparently, my nickname comes from that. `
`"How should I know? Genji-sama's the one who decides the rooms. `
`I don't like it either." `
`"Yes, seriously! `
`Wouldn't it normally go 2 and 2?!" `
`"I mean, who exactly is Yasu anyway?" `
`"It looks like that kid's job is going to school with Milady or something. `
`...So what, is being a school friend a profession now? `
`Doesn't make any sense." `
`...Of course, on days when I am given work, `
`I return to the mansion right after school and work alongside all the others. `
`I help out with caring for the garden and cleaning up the mansion. `
`I can't do any jobs on my own, so I'm always just helping out. `
`...Maybe because I'm young, the adult servants are always kind to me. `
`My fellow Fukuin servants don't seem too happy about that though. `
`"Don't you think Kumasawa-san's obviously soft on Yasu? `
`It's like she's mistaken Yasu for her own grandchild or something!" `
`"And why on earth does that kid get paid the same as the rest of us? `
`I don't get it!" `
`"...I realize that you have school to worry about, `
`but don't forget that you're a servant too, okay? `
`You need to stop being a helper and learn to do work by yourself like the rest of us. `
`We aren't going to let you take it easy forever, okay?" `
`............ `
`I have been trying my best. `
`However, I'm not very strong yet, so I can't carry heavy things. `
`I can't carry a lot of things, either. `
`I can't fold clothes right, and I'm not good at using a dustpan. `
`I just can't do it as well as everyone else... `
`As my face turned red, `
`...I spotted Shannon, who was watching from the sidelines and not joining in. `
`...Shannon is my only ally. `
`Unlike me, she can do everything well. `
`However, she'll never pamper me. `
`She'll show me how things are done, but she'll never steal my jobs from me. `
`She really is incredible. `
`I really want to be like Shannon, as soon as I can. `
`...She never talks behind people's backs, and no one talks behind her back. `
`She's kind, and she gets along with everyone. `
`I want to be like her. `
`And she's always kindly watching over my efforts to become like her. `
`"...Why...did I end up here?" `
`"I don't know." `
`Though I'd just been muttering to the ceiling, `
`Shannon gave me an honest answer. `
`"I guess there's no way to say it, except that it's part of God's plan." `
`"Is this another test from God...?" `
`"Yep. `
`Think of it as a test to help you grow into a wonderful human being. `
`After all, you're a special, chosen person." `
`"...Am I... `
`...special?" `
`"Of course you are. `
`After all, everyone else here is huge, but you were the only one special enough to be chosen young." `
`"Why am I the only one who's little? `
`I can't do any jobs by myself." `
`Everyone complains that I'm just there to play with Milady. `
`And yet, Madam made it clear that I am not to think of Milady as a friend or speak to her in a casual manner. `
`"You may be ten years younger than everyone else, `
`but that means, if you keep it up until you're the same age as the others, `
`you'll be much more experienced than the new people who come later. `
`Even Genji-sama will acknowledge your talents, and you'll become a leader who can teach the new kids who come from the Fukuin House." `
`"And then, I'm sure that everyone will respect you. `
`By that time, even Madam, the Master, and Krauss-sama will acknowledge your skills. `
`That's your future." `
`"...You mean like the ugly duckling becoming a swan?" `
`"That might be it. `
`After all, it was very unusual for you to be chosen as an Ushiromiya family servant. `
`...In fact, that rumor might be true, `
`and you might be the secret child of someone in the Ushiromiya family. `
`*giggle*." `
`Shannon laughed, saying "Wouldn't that be cool" and "Then you'd be super-rich too". `
`But that didn't seem quite right to me. `
`After all, ...if that was the case, why have I had to live all alone, here in the Fukuin House? `
`Shannon and people like the House Director are the only ones who will play with me. `
`I don't have any other friends to play with, ...and I've spent all my time by myself, in my isolated room. `
`Maybe it's because I'm frail and always sleep a lot, ...but it has been lonely. `
`"Hey, Genji! `
`Exactly how much did you know?" `
`"You never talk about anything, but you've known everything since the beginning, haven't you?" `
`"............" `
`"19 years ago, `
`you heard from Natsuhi that a servant had fallen from a cliff holding a baby." `
`"You went to the bottom of that cliff and realized that the baby was still alive, didn't you?" `
`"...I was not qualified `
`to determine whether it was alive or dead." `
`"Then who was?" `
`"The doctor, of course!" `
`""What do you say, Doctor Nanjo?!!"" `
`"...... `
`...Are you certain? `
`...Is it all right for me to speak?" `
`"...If you are willing to tell the story yourself, `
`...then I ask it of you." `
`"...... `
`Very well." `
`...I was contacted by Genji-san immediately after the accident...and asked to conduct an examination in secrecy. `
`"In secrecy?" `
`"Why?" `
`"...Both the Beatrice of Kuwadorian and her child were unregistered people who weren't supposed to exist. `
`It would lead to various problems if it went public..." `
`"I had started the procedures to have the baby registered, but they were not complete at that time. `
`...It was a very unfortunate time for the baby to die." `
`"So, the servant who fell was treated as having died alone in an accident?" `
`"Natsuhi wouldn't talk to anyone. `
`It would've been easy to set up!" `
`"But that baby was alive, wasn't it?" `
`"Correct. `
`...Of course, the child was gravely injured. `
`It was a miracle that it survived that wound. `
`If the angle had been slightly different, `
`or if Genji-san had been any slower in carrying the baby to me... `
`That baby only managed to survive thanks to a series of miracles." `
`"......I had given up. `
`I didn't believe the baby could have survived that." `
`"But it did." `
`"How strong and resilient is life!" `
`"No, this is fate." `
`"Fate! `
`So the baby was fated to live on and eventually accomplish something great?!" `
`"............ `
`...Yes, `
`I did think it was fate. `
`I thought the blood of the Kuwadorian Beatrice-sama, whose life ended on Rokkenjima, `
`must have imparted something onto this child to make it survive." `
`"However, Genji did not tell his master, Kinzo, that the child had survived. `
`He simply said that it had fallen to its death in an unfortunate accident. `
`Kinzo mourned, but his mourning was more one of madness than of sorrow..." `
`"Ooh, {f:5:Beatrice}, why have you run away from me once more?!" `
`"Why, even though I swore I'd never make the same mistake again, why?!!" `
`"There was one matter in which Genji did not trust the master he so respected. `
`That matter was whether Kinzo would be capable of accepting Beatrice's grandchild as her grandchild." `
`"Genji had served the Kuwadorian Beatrice for many years as well. `
`He was very aware of what she had felt. `
`He knew that she had accepted the favor Kinzo had bestowed on her and respected him as a father." `
`"However, her love was not the same as Kinzo's love. `
`Kinzo thought her to be Beatrice reborn... `
`and tried to use her to satisfy the many feelings he had felt for the late Beatrice. `
`Of course, the Kuwadorian Beatrice could not accept those feelings. `
`In the end, she had her chastity stolen `
`by the one she thought of as her only family and respected as a father..." `
`"She thought he was her father, and he thought she was his wife!" `
`"Oh, what irreconcilable, forbidden love!" `
`"...This is not to say that I was incapable of understanding how Kinzo-sama felt. `
`At the moment of her birth, even he did not plan on taking advantage of her... `
`due to her resemblance to the late Beatrice-sama." `
`"He...even spoke to me about it a few times when we were drinking. `
`I always thought he was just joking." `
`"Was he surprised to find that the daughter grew to look more and more like the mother?" `
`"As the daughter grew, did he suffer from a forbidden emotion he couldn't suppress?" `
`"...I thought... `
`...that he might commit the same mistake again. `
`...That was my view." `
`"............" `
`"Beatrice-sama suffered much. `
`And yet, she never truly understood the difference between her feelings and Kinzo's. `
`...Beatrice-sama consulted me many times, laying bare her deepest feelings. `
`However, I was unable to tell her." `
`"That would be hard to say!" `
`"Imagine telling her that the one she respects as a father wants to use her as a replacement for her dead mother!" `
`"...Let me say this for the sake of Kinzo-san's honor. `
`He also suffered greatly. `
`It pained him when he found that he could no longer think of his daughter as a daughter. `
`...I told him to love her as a father. `
`I think Kinzo-san followed his logic and his conscience...and fought for quite some time..." `
`"Kinzo loved her. `
`He poured his affection onto the daughter that Beatrice had left behind. `
`He did so as a father. `
`And yet, if so, why did he give the daughter the same name as the mother?" `
`"Yes, Kinzo's sin started from the moment she received life. `
`She was born, and Beatrice died. `
`...He passed the name down from mother to daughter. `
`From the moment of her birth, Kinzo had already decided that she was Beatrice reborn..." `
`"So, then we get Lion. `
`...Kinzo, trying to atone for his sin, `
`tried to make Lion a proper member of the Ushiromiya family." `
`"...Exactly. `
`I get the feeling I'll get my butt pinched if I talk about other Fragments, `
`...but what if there was a Fragment... `
`...where Lion is accepted... `
`and Kinzo commits the same sin again? `
`Wanna see if we can find one of those? `
`*giggle*giggle*..." `
`"Who would want to see something like that?! `
`...Is this your job, mixing up the worst possible delusions and possibilities for every part of a person's life and sneering at them?!" `
`"Unfortunately, that's the sort of demon she is." `
`"How rude. I'm a witch. `
`*giggle*..." `
`"......Genji foresaw that worst of all possible futures, and, trying to secure a better future, he intentionally lied about the baby being dead." `
`"Right. `
`Kinzo was a man so impulsive that he used his own daughter. `
`Genji, who knew Beatrice's feelings and felt sympathy for her, couldn't trust Kinzo so easily." `
`"Even Genji, Kinzo's most devoted servant?" `
`"Genji draws a clear line between the professional and the personal. `
`While he served Kinzo faithfully, he also felt that the mistake Kinzo had made with his daughter was not one to be forgiven easily." `
`"...Could be. `
`And to make sure that Lion wouldn't be found out easily, Genji lied about the kid's age, lowering it by three years." `
`"That's a good point. `
`In this world, I'm just entering elementary school in 1976. `
`I was actually supposed to become a 4th year then." `
`"If your frailness wasn't the reason, ...then Genji must have been careful to disguise the year of your birth. `
`Not only Kinzo, but also Natsuhi, ...wouldn't easily forget the baby from 19 years ago. `
`If a suspiciously young servant of that age came to the island, Natsuhi's woman's intuition would definitely have picked up on it." `
`Had the child been too sick to go to school for three years? `
`Or had the age been faked, so that Natsuhi wouldn't figure everything out? `
`"Either way, we know that your age has been lowered by three in this world." `
`"...Correct. `
`The age of this world's Lion has been altered by three. `
`...This is a small, feeble kid we're talking about. `
`An underdeveloped kid. `
`It would've been more possible to pull off than you'd think." `
`"Genji decided to wait and see. `
`In the end, would Kinzo be able to accept Beatrice's child as an actual child, or not? `
`He had the child live in the Fukuin House until a suitable age, and then summoned the child to the island as a servant. `
`Both father and child had no clue who the other was. `
`Genji had an idea: `
`if Kinzo truly felt affection as a parent, `
`he would notice traces of that deceased mother and daughter in this child." `
`"That way, they would surely regain their parent-child relationship, without anyone having to expose the truth to them. `
`That's what he thought. `
`...Or, perhaps, the time might come naturally. `
`When that happened, he could tell the truth to both father and child. `
`Believing that this day would eventually come, Genji told nothing of this to anyone. `
`...He watched over Beatrice's child, waiting for the fated day..." `
`And time continued to pass. `
`Days slid by as he quietly watched over Beatrice's child... `
