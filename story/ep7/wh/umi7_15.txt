`"Seriously! `
`Why do guys turn into total morons when they get together?!" `
`Jessica's room was filled with laughter. `
`"It was one hell of a reality check...! `
`I thought this guy was a bit cool, a bit adult-like. `
`And then I see him with some of the other guys in our class, talking about dirty stuff with this creepy laugh!" `
`"It's true that boys always act like little kids when they're together." `
`"Well, it's not like girls are any different!" `
`""Ahhahahahahahaha!!"" `
`The fun chat between girls continued without end. `
`Tonight, Krauss and Natsuhi were out late at a meeting on Niijima. `
`Most of the time, Natsuhi was always watching, so Jessica would always make sure to be curt with the young servants, `
`but when Natsuhi wasn't around, Jessica never did that. `
`She had invited the servants of similar age to her room, and they were chatting away noisily... `
`At that age, everyone wants to know about love. `
`Thanks to the rigid and constricting way Jessica had been brought up, she enjoyed talking about it all the more... `
`"But you're pretty incredible, Milady. And you're that age! `
`Aren't there any boys you're interested in?" `
`"W-Well, I'd like to fall in love, but there really aren't any...g-good ones around...!" `
`"I think you should be a bit more proactive about it. `
`You can act all relaxed now, but that's not gonna last long, okay? `
`Once one of your friends starts going out with someone, it'll turn your world upside down." `
`"Th-There's no way that'll happen... `
`None of my friends are traitors... `
`I-I think." `
`"Ah, no, no, no! `
`The outbreak of love is the one time you can't rely on friendship between girls! `
`If you met someone you liked, you'd betray your friends and go out with the guy without a second thought, wouldn't you?!" `
`"A-Ahahahahahahahahahahaha... `
`Wh-What about you, Shannon...?! `
`It's not fair if I'm the only one who has to talk!" `
`"I, umm, ...don't have anyone like that around..." `
`...Not around. `
`He's far, far away, ...and like Orihime and Hikiboshi, I don't get to see him very often. `
`In fact, ...I don't even know when I'll be able to see him again. `
`...However, I believe that he'll come for me someday. `
`...I believe it. `
`"Don't you betray me, okay, Shannon?! `
`If we get boyfriends, we'll get them together, you got that?! `
`Right? Right? We promised, right?!" `
`"Well, you might not believe it, `
`but it's not at all rare for girls just like Shannon-chan to get a head start! `
`*giggle*giggle*!" `
`"Shannon, confess!! `
`You aren't going out with anyone, are you?! `
`You aren't, right?!" `
`"I-I'm not. Really..." `
`"Really?!" `
`"R-Really..." `
`"We'll get boyfriends together, okay? `
`No matter what happens, okay?! `
`Anyone who lies has to eat porcupinefish!!" `
`"Y-Yes... `
`I promise..." `
`"Now there's the face of a liar! `
`I'm willing to bet Shannon-chan beats everyone else in this room! `
`I can tell. `
`It's always the quiet ones that go first...!" `
`"Shannon, how could you?! `
`Confess, confess!!" `
`"P-Please stop, Milady...! `
`Th-That tickles...! `
`A-Ahahahahaha...!!" `
`...And so, another Sunday afternoon passed by. `
`I worked my way out of the fight and looked up at the sky through the window. `
`...Is Battler-san happily chatting away with his friends somewhere right now, `
`just like I am? `
`As I think of you like this, `
`...are you thinking of me...? `
`But if I ask that, it's the same as admitting that I don't trust you. `
`......I'll wait. `
`And, when you do come for me, I'll announce then and there that I'm quitting my job. `
`I've already prepared myself to do so. `
`...But...you haven't come yet. `
`That isn't because you won't come, ...but because I'm not determined enough yet, right? `
`It's because I haven't clearly envisioned a future with you, right? `
`I'll wait. `
`...No matter how long. `
`...Until you come for me, riding a white horse... `
`I will always treasure our promise. `
`The promise of our precious resolve... `
`"Never make a promise with a guy. `
`You can't count on them!" `
`Thinking that she had read my mind, I spun around. `
`Of course, she hadn't, but... `
`"Well, for stuff like that, `
`I think guys and girls have different ideas of what's important." `
`"No, that's not it. You've got it all wrong. `
`On the whole, girls tend to be dreamers, and guys just do stuff without thinking." `
`"I guess understanding between the sexes is pretty much impossible after all." `
`"At least, I think it's pretty hard. `
`Girls often have the bad habit of thinking they know exactly what the guy is thinking right away. `
`They search for hidden meanings behind words that guys say for no reason in particular, `
`and just get the wrong idea." `
`"Ah, yeah, I've known girls like that. `
`Those girls who hear something that anyone else could tell them was trivial, but think it means the guy is totally into them. `
`Yeah, I see it all the time." `
`"It's a bit sad when a girl gets the wrong idea for no reason." `
`Ahhahahahahahahaha. `
`The pair of them laughed together. `
`...When a girl...gets the wrong idea. `
`Could that be...me...? `
`No, that can't be. `
`After all, Battler-san clearly made a promise. `
`He said he'd come for me riding a white horse. `
`...I mustn't...doubt. `
`I'm sure this conversation I'm hearing is just another one of God's trials. `
`So, I won't listen. `
`I won't care about it. `
`"If there's one thing I never want to be, it's one of those poor girls who thinks a guy's heart is linked to hers for no reason." `
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahahaha." `
`Those demonic sneers tormented me and tried to lead me astray. `
`...I'm sure he'll come to the next family conference... `
`But Battler-san didn't appear at the 1982 conference either... `
`Bit by bit, things were changing from the way they'd been at the last family conference he'd come to. `
`Everyone had gotten completely used to Kyrie-sama, Rudolf-sama's new wife, `
`...and she came down off the boat with a familiar stride. `
`Her daughter, Ange-sama, was growing well, and all of the family focused their attention on her. `
`Even Maria-sama, though she was still tiny, was already five years old. `
`She was full of energy and old enough to enjoy playing with George-sama. `
`Jessica-sama and George-sama had already stopped talking about Battler-san's absence. `
`It was the same with the other relatives too. `
`...No one touched on the subject, as though they had forgotten that Battler-san was missing. `
`Maria-sama had only been three when she'd last seen Battler-san. `
`It was doubtful whether she even remembered him. `
`...In just two years... `
`All trace of your existence...has been erased from the Ushiromiya family conference. `
`That made me sad. `
`And so... `
`"...So, it looks like Battler-san didn't come back this year either." `
`"True. `
`...Feeling a bit lonely?" `
`"Well, ...umm..." `
`"Uncle Rudolf and Aunt Kyrie don't even bring him up anymore. `
`...It looks like Battler-kun was much more serious about it than we thought." `
`"I wonder if he really will stay away forever." `
`"It looks like that was him leaving the nest after all. `
`He's spread his wings and left for a new stage of life. `
`Don't you think so?" `
`"...He's always been crazy and reckless. `
`Well, what more'd you expect from a guy?" `
`"Well, we know Battler-kun. `
`I'm sure he's adapted to his new life and is enjoying himself. `
`So, I don't think there's any reason to worry." `
`When George-sama said that with a smile, `
`I felt a bit uncertain. `
`What does he mean by "there's no reason to worry, I'm sure he's enjoying himself"...? `
`"This is Battler we're talking about, so you can bet he's forgotten all about us and is having a great time." `
`"Yeah, I'll bet he is. `
`And I think that's for the best. `
`Thinking for himself, his family, and his late mother, Battler-kun decided on his own to find a new life. `
`So, I hope he lives that new life to the fullest. `
`If he forgets about the Ushiromiya family, that's just perfect." `
`George-sama smiled at me, as though expecting me to agree. `
`...After a moment of shock, I smoothed my expression over and found the expression he was expecting. `
`Is Battler-san...living happily, `
`...having forgotten about the family, about me, about our promise...? `
`That can't be true. It just can't be. `
`Battler-san must be looking forward to that day of decision just like me. `
`I'm not mistaken about that. `
`He promised me. `
`He said he'd come riding a white horse. `
`I never asked him to say that. `
`He said he'd come for me on the day I resolved myself to live life for his sake. `
`He made that promise himself. `
`For two years, `
`I've believed that. `
`I've done all I could to make it through God's trials and the whisperings of demons that tried to throw me from my path. `
`And yet, ...the things both George-sama and Jessica-sama are saying...are so cruel. `
`Battler-san has forgotten about us and has started a new life? `
`Why are they telling such lies...? `
`But that night... `
`I dreamed of Battler-san for the first time in a long while. `
`The Battler-san in my dream...wasn't the Battler-san I believed in. `
`...It was the Battler-san that George-sama and Jessica-sama had spoken of, `
`...the one who had forgotten everything and started a new life. `
`Morning. `
`I woke up with a tear-stained face. `
`The face I saw in the mirror...cried and told me it couldn't wait any longer. `
`If I've managed to wait this long, why can't I wait any longer...? `
`This is a trial. `
`...So, we must believe in him and wait. `
`But the me in the mirror spoke. `
`...It was sharper than a fragment of glass. `
`...I talk about this promise with him, ...but did we ever really make such a promise...? `
`Wasn't Jessica-sama talking about it? `
`That some girls are dreamers who get the wrong idea? `
`And wasn't George-sama talking about it too? `
`...He said that Battler-san had gotten used to his new life and had forgotten about the Ushiromiya family. `
`...And by now, he isn't the only one who's forgotten. `
`Unless I ask about it, everyone on this island has forgotten his name. `
`Even Rudolf-sama doesn't say his name anymore. `
`If I weren't here to remember his face, `
`...perhaps his existence would have been erased from everyone's hearts. `
`...I don't believe it. `
`So, I won't doubt. `
`Battler-san must still remember his promise. `
`We're both waiting for the day of decision, the day we'll be together. `
`......Battler-san. `
`I've firmly made up my mind. `
`Does the fact that you're not here mean that, after all, I'm not determined enough? `
`No. `
`...It's because you and God are testing me, isn't it? `
`In that case, I will endure. `
`Until that promised day inevitably comes. `
`...So, ...please. `
`Battler-san. `
`I want some proof...that you haven't forgotten me... `
`It was the crack that ran across my ceramic-like heart. `
`I had to acknowledge it now. `
`...It may be...that I'm pretending not to notice something terrifying and sad. `
`Battler-san...makes me yearn for him. `
`Battler-san...makes me sad. `
`Battler-san...makes it hurt... `
`Battler-san. `
`...Do you still remember me, now...? `
`And then...came the third family conference since Battler-san left. `
`If the number of beds was going to increase, we would've been told about that when setting up. `
`The fact that nothing has changed in particular...means that he probably won't be here this year either. `
`Clinging to a final bit of hope, I stood by the docks, watching the boat draw closer. `
`"Hey, Shannon-chan. `
`You're looking as pretty as ever." `
`"Careful, Ange. `
`Watch your step." `
`"Hey, Shannon. Ah, I really do love Rokkenjima...! `
`I can't wait for Uncle Krauss to turn it into a resort." `
`"There's no need for that. `
`It'd be such a waste." `
`"Heheheh, you've got a point there. `
`How have you been, Shannon-chan? `
`I think you've gotten a bit taller since last time." `
`"...Thank you very much." `
`"And the weather's good again this year...! `
`It's so great, havin' every single member of the family together all nice and cheerful." `
`"Please allow me to guide you to the mansion..." `
`So, after all, ...Battler-san has been so thoroughly forgotten that he might not have existed in the first place. `
`I'm sure the sadness will show on my face. `
`Not wanting anyone to see it, ...I turned my back to the family and led the way up to the mansion by myself. `
`Then, ...suddenly, someone mentioned Battler-san's name, and I jumped. `
`"What, you saw Battler-kun?" `
`"How's he doing...?!" `
`"Yeah. `
`He's doing very well. `
`I took Ange and had some tea with him the other day." `
`I was surprised. `
`...So, Kyrie-sama was in touch with Battler-san. `
`According to her, both Battler-san and Rudolf-sama had long since calmed down after their fight, `
`but both were so stubborn that they hadn't found a good chance to make up. `
`And, since Battler-san had gotten used to living with his grandparents and going to school there, `
`and considering that those grandparents might make things even more difficult, going to convince Battler-san to come home wouldn't be easy. `
`"...It's just too bad. `
`I think Asumu-san's parents were even more angry than Battler-kun was. `
`This isn't just an issue between Battler-kun and Rudolf-san anymore." `
`"Then will Battler be coming back sometime soon?" `
`"He will make up with Rudolf-san, but it looks like he doesn't intend to return to the Ushiromiya family. `
`...Such a shame. `
`Though I do understand how he feels." `
`It was a bit of a relief to hear that some of the bad feeling had died down in these three years. `
`If we take Asumu-sama's parents into account, it's no surprise that things haven't gone as well as they could. `
`But if Battler-san doesn't hate Rudolf-sama anymore, ...then someday... `
`...Surely he'll come back. `
`He'll have grown so much. `
`My resolve will not waver anymore. `
`For some nights these past three years, I've felt sad and resentful. `
`But now, ...it feels as though those three years were something I needed. `
`After all, ...the seeds of love, the faint feelings I once had for you... `
`have budded powerfully, waiting for the day that we'll be reunited. `
`This is how honest my feelings for you are now. `
`...I...love you. `
`I want to see you again as soon as I can. `
`Until that time, ...I'll keep that bud of love warm and growing for you... `
`I won't doubt the coming of that day anymore. `
`Just as I think of you, under the same sky... `
`I believe that you are thinking of me. `
`...I'm sure this news about him is a sign that God is cheering me on. `
`So, I asked God one more time, inside my heart. `
`Since my feelings for Battler-san have not wavered for a day these past three years... `
`Let me know that he feels the same way. `
`I know that asking for that is a sin. `
`However, now that we've reached a three-year turning point, `
`...I want some gift from God, any gift, to show that I have not waited in vain. `
`That is what I prayed. `
`"Oh, that's right. `
`It's been so long since Battler-kun last saw you all, right? `
`I thought you might be feeling lonely, so I told him to write you letters. `
`Here they are." `
`......Huh...? `
`Did God...really hear my prayers? `
`I felt as though my heart was going to leap out of my chest. `
`"A letter from Battler? `
`Awesome! `
`What'd he write?!" `
`"Did he say anything about how he's been doing lately? `
`I can't wait to read it." `
`Kyrie-sama pulled a brown envelope out of her bag and handed it to George-sama. `
`Just one? `
`When George-sama opened it, several folded letters came out. `
`"Looks like this one's addressed to me. `
`...They all have different names on them. `
`Here, this one's yours, Jessica-chan." `
`"Thanks!" `
`"And this one's for Maria-chan. `
`Can she read yet...?" `
`"I'll read it to her later. `
`Thank you." `
`"There's even one for Ange-chan. `
`Now of course she can't read." `
`"*giggle* `
`I'll give it to her when she does learn." `
`"He says he's doing great and having a blast...! `
`Good for him." `
`"...Umm, `
`...is that... `
`all of them...?" `
`"Yep. `
`Looks like that's all of them. `
`Thanks a lot." `
`George-sama handed me the empty envelope. `
`...Apparently, he thanked me because he thought I was offering to throw it away for him. `
`And, clearly, ...there was nothing inside it. `
`There was no letter for me... `
`"Whoa. `
`The more I read, the more fun it looks like Battler-kun's been having. `
`Living every day to the fullest." `
`"That's what it looks like in mine, too. `
`If he's happy, then I guess that's what counts." `
`"*giggle* `
`That's so mean of Battler-kun. `
`It sounds like he forgot about us until you told him to write those letters, Kyrie-san." `
`"Well, you know what he's like. `
`It sounds like he was living life to the fullest. `
`And I hear he's popular with the ladies at school, too." `
`"Wow...! `
`That's incredible!" `
`"There should be plenty of girls who like those hilarious, melodramatic lines of his. `
`Makes sense to me." `
`"I wonder if he really does plan not to return to the Ushiromiya Family." `
`"It looks like it. `
`In mine, it says he doesn't think he'll return to Rokkenjima again." `
`I knew that all of these letters... `
`were trials from God. `
`The fact that there was no letter for me... `
`and the fact that he was enjoying life and had forgotten about Rokkenjima... `
`were just more trials. `
`He is... `
`God is... `
`...testing me. `
`The fact that there was no letter for me alone is proof of that... `
`......That's... `
`...what I want to think... `
`...But... `
`...now it's just... `
`Too much...... `
`"...It might've been an important promise to you, `
`...but it looks like it wasn't for Battler." `
`"............" `
`"...No way. `
`...Then, that promise about him coming for you was..." `
`"I was a dreamer. It was just an illusion I created..." `
`"To Battler, they were probably just meaningless words to make him sound cool." `
`...To anyone but her, it would have been such a funny story to hear. `
`That promise with Battler might have been an illusion the whole time. `
`In the first place, we don't know if they both felt the same way about each other at all. `
`Love is an illusion. `
`However, if both sides are seeing the same illusion, that love becomes true. `
`However, when the feelings of each side are different, ...then it's nothing more than a joke. `
`"This is Battler's sin." `
`"...Making Shannon think...that it was a promise." `
`"Wrong." `
`"...Huh?" `
`"...It's that he didn't even remember." `
`"If he simply broke his promise, ...I could have taken him to task for it. `
`I could have regretted my mistake, or I could have won him back. `
`...However, you can't question someone about something they don't even remember." `
`"............" `
`"I am unable to hate Battler-san. `
`...After all, Battler-san didn't even break his promise." `
`"There just wasn't...any promise to start with." `
`"...It was nothing more than a sad...joke." `
`...I kept on crying and crying. `
`I dug my fingernails into my pillow, soaking it with my tears. `
`How much easier it would be to hate something... `
`But I can't hate anything. `
`I just couldn't get over my miserable arrogance, `
`which had led me to believe for three whole years that he felt the same as I did. `
`"...I am to blame for this. `
`...My irresponsible words led you to believe that Battler made a promise..." `
`"No...... `
`This isn't anyone's fault. `
`...It's all because I assumed that he felt the same way I did..." `
`"Battler made no promise. `
`And yet, his feelings were surely sincere! `
`Though there might have been a difference in degree when compared to yours, `
`it is true that he liked you! `
`Of that, there can be no doubt." `
`"...Please, ...just stop it... `
`...I've believed that he liked me the way I liked him, without ever doubting that. `
`...Please don't try to cheer me up. `
`...I'd rather...that you mocked me..." `
`Before I knew it, `
`...a dull, inescapable pain had pierced my chest. `
`When I pressed my hand against my chest, I realized what that pain was. `
`It was the bud of love, whose seeds I had sown and nurtured in my heart. `
`Its roots had spread all the way across my chest, `
`...tormenting me like a metal wire wrapped around my heart. `
`They looked less like roots...and more like fissures running through my heart. `
`I can only hold back the pain by tearing out the root of love. `
`But no matter how much I scratch at it, I'm only scratching at my chest. `
`...The root of love doesn't move at all. `
`If I started hating Battler-san, without any lingering interest or regrets, `
`...I'd be able to pull this root out easily. `
`Once I did, it would probably leave a hole behind, but at least it wouldn't hurt me anymore. `
`But I can't pull it out. `
`...Even though it hurts so much, those roots of love are still stuck in my heart. `
`"...Shannon......" `
`"I... `
`...Even now, `
`I... `
`...love Battler-san. `
`...I want to see him. `
`I want him to come back... `
`I believe he will come back someday, `
`and I want to wait for him... `
`...But right now... `
`it's just... `
`too much..." `
`As I sobbed, the tightness in my chest grew even stronger. `
`As long as I like Battler-san, that pain will always continue. `
`Because I like him, I want to hold onto that pain forever. `
`But, ...it was written right there in the letters for George-sama and the others. `
`Battler doesn't plan on returning to the Ushiromiya family. `
`He's forgotten about me and Rokkenjima... `
`and has started a new life with a different name. `
`I must wait for him for all eternity, `
`...despite how painful, aching, excruciating this is... `
`"Is this another trial...? `
`Is God telling me... `
`to wait for him forever...? `
`I can't do that... `
`I... `
`...want to be with Battler-san. `
`But if this is the trial... `
`that I must go through for that, `
`...then it's just `
`too painful..." `
`"............" `
`{f:5:Beatrice} hung her head in shame. `
`If she hadn't encouraged Shannon so much, it probably wouldn't have been this painful. `
`Shannon may have been the one to sow the seed of love in her heart. `
`However, {f:5:Beatrice} had irresponsibly watered it and told Shannon not to give up. `
`...{f:5:Beatrice} scratched at her chest, trying to share Shannon's pain... `
`"......This is...my fault." `
`{f:5:Beatrice} mumbled to herself. `
`"...What's your fault?" `
`"For three years, I tortured you with the illusion of a promise that never happened. `
`...If I had not nourished the bud of love within you, you would not have suffered so." `
`"............" `
`"Shannon, `
`this may sound harsh, ...but listen." `
`"...What is it...?" `
`"Forget Battler. `
`...There was no bud of love in the first place." `
`"...No. `
`I'm the one who nourished it. `
`...No matter how painful it is, I can't forget it." `
`"But you cannot bear that pain any longer, can you...?" `
`"............" `
`Wordlessly, Shannon held her chest and hung her head. `
`I...love Battler. `
`That feeling burns inside me, `
`...so that I still cannot let it go no matter how much it hurts. `
`And, I've spent three years pretending that I didn't feel that pain. `
`Now, I know that I feel it. `
`And since I know, ...I can't bear it... `
`"So, you cannot throw away your bud of love for Battler?" `
`"......Yes." `
`"However, at this rate, the bud... `
`...the root...will kill you." `
`"............" `
`"People need a universe to survive. `
`...And one person cannot create that universe alone. `
`Two are needed." `
`"...A universe..." `
`"Together with Battler, you created the universe of that bud of love. `
`...Now that one half of that pair is gone, your universe has crumbled. `
`...People cannot...complete a universe on their own." `
`"However, `
`...Battler-san, the other person who creates my universe, `
`...won't come back..." `
`"Then you must create a new universe with someone else." `
`"...You mean, ...create one with someone other than Battler-san?" `
`"I will give you such a person." `
`"...Which...person...?" `
`"A creature to bury the pain in your heart and heal you. `
`...He will not betray you. `
`...Yes, ...let it be a sibling. `
`...I will give you a little brother." `
`"A little brother......" `
`"A boy you have always been close to at the Fukuin House, whom you love as if he were your real brother. `
`...That, I shall give to you. `
`...Together with him, you will create a new universe." `
`"...Will that little brother...make me forget about the pain of my love for Battler-san...?" `
`"Correct. `
`...You need a universe." `
`"Then, ...what will happen... `
`to the bud of love in my heart? `
`...My feelings for Battler-san won't change. `
`...I can't make them wither." `
`"...... `
`...I shall... `
`accept that bud and those roots in your place." `
`"...You will......?" `
`"You can forget the pain of love and create a new universe. `
`...I will accept the bud of love in your place. `
`...It means that I will accept the pain as well, `
`...but I will learn of the single element I do not possess, love." `
`{f:5:Beatrice}...wanted to know love. `
`She wanted to feel what Shannon had felt in the world of humans. `
`"...And, `
`if Battler ever does return, `
`if the bud still has not withered and you still desire it, `
`I shall return it to you. `
`...What do you think of that?" `
`"............" `
`Still hanging her head, ...Shannon gave a small nod, but said nothing. `
`It would mean release from this unbearable pain. `
`And, it would mean giving the bud of love to the witch, to hold in her place... `
`Shannon spread the hands that she had held to her chest. `
`As she did, a faint light popped out of her chest and floated in the air, `
`...gradually swallowing everything with its brightness. `
`As the brilliant light began to fade away, Shannon and {f:5:Beatrice}, still facing each other, `
`were now inside a vast, starry sphere, like a planetarium. `
`They were the only ones in this pitch-black starry sea. `
`...Shannon felt as though she'd seen this place once before, but she couldn't remember. `
`Then, I made another announcement. `
`"Modify this world. `
`...Let the bud of love travel from Shannon to {f:5:Beatrice}." `
`This way, Shannon won't be tormented by the bud of love anymore. `
`And, furthermore, she will be given a little brother, ...with whom she can create a new universe. `
`The design for the little brother will be a younger boy at the Fukuin House, with whom Shannon was close. `
`For a name, ...let there be the {p:0:音} character, as the Fukuin House rules state. `
`......Yeah, I've decided. `
`...That's a perfect name to go with Shannon's. `
`He'll be...a quiet, reticent boy. `
`He'll come to Rokkenjima as a new servant. `
`There, he'll open his heart to Shannon. `
`As a duty-minded boy who loves Shannon like a big sister, he'll always be there for her... `
`Let's have him be a special servant like Genji, who is permitted to serve Kinzo directly. `
`...Yeah. `
`That sounds kinda cool. `
`Then, {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`From now on, you will carry the bud of love. `
`In other words, ...the role of being infatuated with Battler and waiting for his return will go to you. `
`While you are still the witch who reigns over Rokkenjima's night... `
`You have also been waiting for Ushiromiya Battler, ever since that day three years ago. `
`Along with this change in setting, I'll give you a new form as well... `
`He did tell us what his ideal woman would look like once, remember? `
`...A woman with a good figure and long, golden hair, like a foreign model. `
`Golden hair. `
`Long hair. `
`A good figure. `
`...Yeah. `
`Something like that. `
`That's what the new {f:5:Beatrice} will look like. `
`Come now, hold that bud of love in your heart as you wait for Battler. `
`...This way, you will learn of love, in exchange for earning pain. `
`Yes, this will be the setting for my new world. `
`For Shannon, a new servant like a little brother will come. `
`He will be a silent, reticent boy. `
`A duty-minded kid who loves Shannon as a sister. `
`And the bud of love that has tortured Shannon...will go to the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`She will just be holding onto the bud of love for the time being. `
`However, while she holds onto it, she will be a maiden in love with Battler. `
`For that time, you will be able to learn what love is... `
`Come, let the world be modified. `
`Oh, I am one yet many. `
`Awaken, us. `
`And stretch your wings in this new world... `
`...Slowly, ...I opened my eyes to the gentle rays of the morning sun. `
`............ `
`How long has it been since I last saw such a pleasant morning. `
`...The face in my mirror is tear-stained and pathetic. `
`However, ...my heart is as clear as the morning sun. `
`I could still clearly remember that strange dream. `
`However, I can feel myself forgetting it rapidly... `
`The place I was in my dreams...had been such a strange place. `
`A peaceful, calm place. `
`...There, ...I had left behind the pain I had carried in my chest until yesterday. `
`So this morning, my heart was at peace... `
`"Good morning, me..." `
`My tear-stained face really is pathetic. `
`However, my expression is bright and cheery. `
`Even now, `
`I... `
`like Battler-san. `
`But, ...for some reason, `
`...I've calmed down. `
`It feels like I've put something precious safely away in the place it belongs. `
`......Battler-san. `
`When will you come back, I wonder... `
`When you do, I'd like to talk about mystery novels again. `
`...Oh, I almost forgot. `
`A new boy servant will be coming today, right? `
`One of the rare servants who will serve the Master directly. `
`What kind of kid will he be? `
`I hope we get along well... `
`What was his name again? `
`I'm pretty sure it was, umm... `
