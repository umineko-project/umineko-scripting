`Quietly, quietly. `
`...The rain fell down. `
`The rain of sadness dripped down the outer walls of the chapel, quietly washing away the dust of the world of the living. `
`The chapel doors were open. `
`During a wedding, only those with invitations are allowed inside. `
`However, during a funeral, the doors are open to all who remember the deceased. `
`...So, this must be a funeral. `
`A shadow holding an umbrella approached the chapel. `
`It was...Will. `
`"............" `
`A reception desk had been set up at the chapel's entrance. `
`As the shadow approached, Kanon, who had been sitting at this desk, stood up and welcomed him with a bow. `
`"...This is the reception desk. `
`We are collecting the names of all mourners. `
`If you would sign in here..." `
`"Sorry, `
`but I'm not a mourner. `
`...I'm here to meet with someone." `
`You came to a funeral to meet someone...? `
`A dubious expression rose to Kanon's face. `
`Will pulled an envelope from his pocket and showed him the sender's name. `
`"...My apologies. `
`Please, enter." `
`"Thanks. `
`...Could I at least have one of those?" `
`"...Thank you very much. `
`...I am sure she will be pleased." `
`Kanon handed him one of a set of golden roses, which were being handed out to all the mourners. `
`Will took it, `
`...silently bowed his head, and entered the chapel. `
`Inside the chapel, several people who appeared to be the family of the deceased were gathered, `
`and they all seemed to be recalling memories of the departed. `
`"Oooooooohhh... `
`Beatriiiiice... `
`Why, `
`whyyyyyyyy... `
`oooooooohhhhh..." `
`"Father, please, take care... `
`Why don't you rest in the waiting room for a bit..." `
`"............" `
`"I killed her... `
`...I did it...!" `
`"Absurd...! `
`How could that be, Rosa-sama...?" `
`"Father's really bawling." `
`"...Yeah. "Beatriiiiice", huh?" `
`"I'm sure he didn't cry this much when Mother passed away." `
`"Hey. `
`Now's not the time to say things like that." `
`Some sobbed, unable to conceal their tears, `
`and some spoke softly of old memories. `
`...They were all remembering the dead in their own way, ...it seemed. `
`When Will approached the altar, several people turned around. `
`Of course, none of them knew who Will was. `
`Paying this no mind, Will walked in front of the casket on the altar, which seemed to be buried under golden roses. `
`...Inside the casket, there was no corpse. `
`Instead, as though it lay there in place of a body, `
`...was a single, thick book with an extravagant binding. `
`The space all around it was filled with countless golden roses. `
`There were words printed on the book's cover. `
`'To my beloved Beatrice. `
`October 5th, 1986' `
`"...<Miss> Beatrice. `
`If it was <Mrs>, then forgive me. `
`...I've never met you. `
`However, allow me to express my condolences." `
`He took the rose he had received from the reception area and placed it in the casket. `
`...He had absolutely no connection to the woman called Beatrice. `
`However, since he had come to visit a funeral, he had to show this minimum amount of respect for the dead. `
`As part of this, Will prayed for the passage of the dead into the next world... `
`"Pardon me, `
`...but who might you be? `
`I am Ushiromiya Krauss. `
`I'm serving as the chief mourner. `
`This is my child, Lion." `
`"Pleased to meet you. `
`I'm Ushiromiya Lion." `
`"...Lion? `
`...Who the heck are you?" `
`"It's written as "{p:0:理御}", but pronounced "Lee-on". `
`...I guess it is a bit strange for a Japanese name." `
`"............" `
`Will stared at Lion's face, wearing a confused expression. `
`He hadn't seemed particularly interested in Krauss, but Lion had apparently drawn some sort of reaction from him. `
`Rather than interest, it was more as though he felt like something was out of place. `
`"...Krauss-sama, `
`Madam says it is about time..." `
`"Ah, I see. `
`...Ladies and gentlemen. `
`If we're too noisy in here, it may disturb the dead. `
`I've been told that the waiting room has been readied. `
`Shall we move over there?" `
`When Krauss called out to everyone, they began to move towards the chapel waiting room. `
`"My apologies. `
`Lion, could you entertain our guest for now? `
`I will guide the others to the waiting room." `
`"Yes, Father." `
`It looked like a natural conversation, with no awkwardness for either father or child. `
`"Father and child, is it?" `
`"Yes, but why do you ask...?" `
`"Ushiromiya Krauss's child is supposed to be Jessica." `
`"Jessica's my little sister. `
`Do you need me to call for her...?" `
`"...... `
`...No, that won't be necessary." `
`Apparently, ...some sort of game was already being played right off the bat. `
`Scratching at his head with an irritated look on his face, Will glanced around. `
`"...Pardon me, but what sort of relation did you have with the deceased?" `
`"None at all. `
`...It's a real pain." `
`"......Then why did you come to this funeral?" `
`Since Lion was a fairly mild person, Will's behavior was met with nothing more than a blank expression. `
`...A normal person would probably have put on a dubious look long before this. `
`Will scratched his head again and yelled angrily at someone other than Lion. `
`"I'm here. `
`Isn't it about time you showed your face?" `
`The members of the Ushiromiya family had already followed Krauss's instructions and moved to the waiting room. `
`By now, no one could be seen in this cold, vast chapel decorated with gold roses except for Will and Lion. `
`"...So, you've come, `
`...Wizard-hunting Wright, `
`Inquisitor of Heresy." `
`The girl's voice came suddenly from behind the pair. `
`When Lion turned around in surprise, a girl had appeared out of nowhere and drifted down on top of the altar. `
`She landed softly on the sacred funeral altar as though this was perfectly normal, `
`crushing the golden roses under her shoes... `
`Of course, Lion didn't know this girl. `
`...Just why on earth were all of these people unrelated to the funeral... `
`popping up one after another? `
`"I'm already retired. `
`If you have a job you need doing, go ask the new Wright." `
`"No. `
`You're the one I want to ask. `
`I'm giving this case to you. `
`...Did you read the "tale" I sent you...?" `
`"...I skimmed it." `
`"I-I don't know who you are, but please get down from there. `
`That's a sacred altar." `
`Snapping out of a daze, Lion told the girl to get down off the altar, but she ignored this completely. `
`On top of that, Will kept on talking to the girl as though Lion wasn't even there. `
`"I hear this is Lion. `
`Who is that, exactly?" `
`"You've already heard who." `
`Ushiromiya...Lion. `
`There's no case of a person with that name appearing in any of the previous games. `
`"Is this your piece?" `
`"No. `
`It's a true and proper piece of this game board. `
`A character appearing in the story." `
`"You're the Game Master. `
`That means it's your piece." `
`"*giggle*... `
`...I've just moved from Beato's cat box into a larger cat box. `
`Lion is one of the pieces who has a possibility of appearing inside it." `
`"...Ah, I see. `
`...In other words, it's your piece." `
`"It's a piece I've placed...would be the correct way to say it." `
`"So you're saying this piece isn't your subordinate, like Erika." `
`"...Erika? Who's that? `
`...*giggle*giggle*." `
`"........." `
`"...Erika...san? `
`????" `
`"Don't try to understand. `
`You'll just get a headache." `
`Lion didn't have a clue what they were talking about. `
`However, though neither person was familiar, it seemed clear that they both knew a lot about the Ushiromiya family. `
`"I-I don't know what you two are talking about... `
`Anyway, you, girl. `
`Please, get down off the altar. `
`I ask this as the Successor to the Ushiromiya Family Headship." `
`Even Lion was finally forced to speak in a raised voice to that girl, who continued to chat while casually standing on the altar. `
`However, the girl ignored this completely. `
`On the other hand, Will did show a reaction. `
`"...The Successor is supposed to be Krauss." `
`"My father, Krauss, will be the acting Head until I turn 20. `
`Then, I am to succeed the Headship." `
`"First I've heard of this. `
`Can you prove it?" `
`It seemed that even Lion was starting to get ticked off by now. `
`That calm expression appeared to twitch slightly. `
`"This is the Successor's Silver Ring of the One-Winged Eagle. `
`Is that proof enough for you?" `
`"......A silver ring? `
`The golden Head's Ring has appeared several times, but I've never heard anything about a silver ring for the Successor. `
`...I don't remember Krauss or Jessica ever wearing one of those." `
`"*giggle*... `
`I'm glad. `
`For someone who's just skimmed it, it seems you've read it pretty well." `
`"When a witch hands you a story, you never know when something absurd will pop up. `
`Especially when it's a great witch from the Senate." `
`"...Wh- `
`Who in the world... `
`are you two?! `
`Sorry, but I don't have a clue what you're talking about. `
`If you've finished offering flowers for the departed, please make your exit. `
`It seems you two aren't worthy of our family's hospitality." `
`Lion finally ran out of patience. `
`These were the strictest words that this gentle kid could unleash. `
`However, Will and the girl seemed not to care at all... `
`"I didn't come here because I wanted to." `
`"We're wasting time, so let's move onwards. `
`...Wright, `
`try and beat this game. `
`As the Game Master, {f:5:Bernkastel}, I invite you to join in." `
`"I refuse." `
`"Why?" `
`"I'm retired now. `
`...Reasoning and mysteries aren't my business anymore." `
`"How do you intend to spend the rest of your life? `
`Is Wizard-hunting Wright going to give up witch hunting?" `
`"...There's still fox hunting and clam hunting to look forward to. `
`I didn't come here to discuss the rest of my life with you." `
`"So, you came here to refuse?" `
`"Know that your powers of deduction are truly a sight to behold..." `
`"Then do as you will. `
`Go wherever you please. `
`...That is, assuming that you can leave this place." `
`"......Tch. `
`...So? `
`What are the terms and payment?" `
`In truth, Will had resigned himself from the beginning. `
`He knew that he was incapable of refusing an invitation from the Great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}. `
`""Who killed {f:5:Beatrice}?" `
`That's my game. `
`In payment, I'll forgive you for your insolence and let you leave this chapel." `
`"I hear that boredom-hating witches just love being spoken to rudely." `
`"That's only for hags who've tired of life after a thousand years. `
`I'm still plenty young, `
`so I love thinking up horrible fates in which to trap rude men like you..." `
`"...Tch. `
`So? `
`Who's my enemy?" `
`"There is none. `
`There's no one to stand in your way. `
`I just want to sit back and watch you make your beautiful checkmate in this game... `
`I've even found you an ally. `
`That's what this Lion is for." `
`"...?" `
`After hearing that name spoken out of the blue, Lion frowned once more. `
`Apparently, they were moving things along without Lion's knowledge or understanding, which the latter seemed to find truly irritating. `
`"Lion is a member of the Ushiromiya family... `
`and should prove to be a useful ally, seeing as no one in the family knows you." `
`"...I'm not sure what this is all about, but I can hardly be of assistance until I know what's going on here." `
`"There, see? `
`...With help like this, it'll be a piece of cake." `
`"Entertain me...and my master, Wizard-hunting Wright. `
`...Auau may be a polite theatergoer, `
`but I might throw popcorn at you if I get bored, okay...?" `
`"............" `
`Will scratched at his head with a displeased look on his face. `
`He wasn't at all interested in getting involved, `
`...but by now, he realized that he couldn't disobey {f:5:Bernkastel}'s orders. `
`Then, he approached the casket... `
`and pointed at its rose-filled insides. `
`"You ask me to solve the case of {f:5:Beatrice}'s murder, but... `
`{p:1:Van Dine's Twenty Rules, Rule #7. `
`It is forbidden to have a crime without a corpse}." `
`"{p:2:That's a Devil's Proof. `
`Maybe it just isn't inside the casket? `
`Unless you can prove that no corpse exists, this is mystery}." `
`"{p:1:Rule #1. It is forbidden to have a crime without all clues presented}." `
`"{p:1:Don't worry. `
`Everything is gathered here}." `
`"........." `
`Though there was no change to Will's unsatisfied expression, `
`...he seemed to have understood the general pattern of this place. `
`...The simple fact that a mere Inquisitor of Heresy had been summoned by an uninhibited, fickle, cruel great witch of the Senate... `
`meant that he'd be treated as no more than a mere underling. `
`All along, he had possessed no way to refuse her... `
`"...So, who killed the owner of this empty coffin...? `
`...I'll answer that question. `
`However, you'll let me do things my way." `
`"As you like." `
`"First off, ...I need to make you understand the current situation." `
`"...Yes, that would be extremely helpful at the moment." `
`Lion's expression seemed nonplussed, angry, and confused, `
`all at the same time. `
`"Over here. `
`...It'll be faster to see it for yourself." `
`"...Wonderful. `
`Please, lead the way." `
`Will signaled with his chin for Lion to follow him and spun around. `
`After snorting once in an unsatisfied manner, `
`Lion followed him, as though resigned to see Will's little show. `
`...As she watched them leave the chapel, `
`...{f:5:Bernkastel} sneered silently at them, a cold smile on her face. `
`"......As the miko of the great Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating, {f:5:Featherine} Something {f:5:Auaurora}, `
`and as the Witch of Miracles, ...I, {f:5:Bernkastel}, `
`announce the start of this game." `
`"...The tale's title is "Requiem of the Golden Witch". `
`...Spin a tale fitting for Beato's funeral. `
`...*giggle*giggle* `
`Well now, let's see just how you drag out the guts." `
`She watched until the pair had left the chapel. `
`{f:5:Bernkastel}'s form evaporated into the empty air, just as she had arrived. `
`All that remained was her unpleasant cackling... `
`Outside, it was still raining. `
`When Kanon saw the guest and the Successor approaching the reception desk, he bowed deeply. `
`"...Good work. `
`You can take a break now, so would you mind leaving? `
`Umm, `
`........." `
`"......It's Kanon. `
`Yes, as you wish." `
`Kanon bowed deeply, then disappeared. `
`"Don't you remember the names of all your servants?" `
`"...Our family has many young servants coming in and out, and they're usually replaced quite frequently. `
`Well now. `
`What are you trying to explain to me? `
`Who are you, and what business do you have with this family? `
`Of course, there's no need to convince me. `
`Feel free to head on home, if you want." `
`"There is no going home. `
`Not for me, `
`...not for anyone." `
`"Could you please give that a rest? `
`Stop speaking in confusing riddles like that all the time. `
`Even I have limits to my patience. `
`If you don't want me to see you off, should I call Genji or Gohda?" `
`"Don't freak out. `
`...Look at this." `
`"Yes, I can see that. `
`It's one of the memorial roses. `
`Are you going to show me some kind of magic trick?" `
`Will took one of the flower offerings, `
`then showed it to Lion, as though pointing out that there were no mechanisms or tricks. `
`Then, he slowly lifted it upwards. `
`"...Watch." `
`"Yes, I'm watching. `
`Is a dove going to fly out of it? `
`Or is it going to be flags and fireworks? `
`...Huh?" `
`Will threw the rose. `
`Anyone would have expected it to fly in an arc... `
`and land in some puddle. `
`It didn't, which was why Lion had been struck dumb. `
`The rose thrown by Will certainly had flown in an arc. `
`It should have sped on rapidly through the air. `
`However, as soon as it passed out from the shade of the eaves and was about to reach the rain, `
`...it stopped right in midair, `
`as though the air surrounding it had turned into syrup. `
`That wasn't all. `
`As it hung in midair, the rose's beautiful golden petals began to darken one after another, `
`...and it became a black husk, like burnt charcoal. `
`And, even after this happened, it remained suspended there in the air... `
`"...What sort of trick is this? `
`...Ah-" `
`"Don't move." `
`Lion had moved closer to try and touch the remains of the rose, which still hung in the air. `
`Will had roughly blocked the way with his arm. `
`It was as though he was telling Lion that leaving this place meant certain death. `
`"...This chapel has been cut off from the Fragment. `
`We're currently locked in a concentrated loop of time." `
`"What... `
`...do you mean by that...?!" `
`"...Explaining's a pain, so I'll just give you the short version. `
`Basically, unless we play along with that witch's game, no one can leave this place." `
`"...Wh-What...?! `
`The funeral is already over! `
`I'm sure some people will want to return to the mansion or the guesthouse. `
`We can't be locked up in here!" `
`"If you've got a bone to pick, that witch is the one you're looking for. `
`Being stuck in a place like this isn't any more pleasant for me." `
`"That girl's your friend, right?! `
`Make her stop all this weirdness." `
`"She's probably sitting in a spectator's seat with a bucket of popcorn about now. `
`She won't come if we just call her." `
`"Wh-What on earth is going on?!!" `
`That short sentence described all of Lion's feelings at that moment. `
`However, Lion had seen the rose Will threw wither in an instant in the rainy darkness. `
`...Lion tried doing the same thing with another rose, but the effect was exactly the same. `
`No one would want to use their own body to test this fearsome something that could make roses crumble instantly... `
`"There's only one way for us to be released from here. `
`...We have to play along with {f:5:Bernkastel}'s game." `
`"...You mean the one about who killed Beatrice?" `
`"That's what she's telling us to investigate. `
`If you could fill me in, this'll go more quickly. `
`...That fickle witch will be completely satisfied. `
`You'll be able to get rid of the two of us, and I have a date with Diana when I get back. `
`...If I keep her waiting too long, she'll start tearing up the sofa again." `
`"Who killed Beatrice, you say...? `
`That's hardly something you should go barging into a funeral and asking the family about." `
`"Questioning the family is one of the basics of the mystery genre. `
`Just give up and accept it. `
`...I do know that Beatrice is the mistress of Kinzo, the Family Head." `
`"...... `
`You really are a strange person. `
`...How do you know so much about this family? `
`...Are you sure you have no connections with us...?" `
`Will knew this much about the Ushiromiya family...because {f:5:Bernkastel} had shown him all of the Fragments so far. `
`Of course, he had no sort of connection with the Ushiromiya family himself. `
`The very plane of his existence was on a different level. `
`"However, Beatrice died a long, long time ago. `
`According to Genji, she passed away before the mansion was completed, `
`but the reason for her death is unclear. `
`......To be honest, this is the first I've heard about her being "killed". `
`...Tell me about it." `
`"...My name is Ushiromiya Lion." `
`"Willard. `
`Call me Will." `
`For the first time, Will introduced himself. `
`Their mutual introduction was finally complete, and Lion was finally able to talk with him on an even footing. `
`...However, Lion took a deep breath and looked up at the sky, wearing a vague smile. `
`"Will-san." `
`"Call me Will. `
`I'll call you Lion." `
`"...Will. `
`To be honest, ...even I don't know much about this person called Beatrice." `
`"......I see. `
`I guess it's called a game for a reason." `
`If only Lion could've told him everything, revealing the truth without any effort from Will... `
`Apparently, things wouldn't be so easy after all. `
`"Everyone who enters the Ushiromiya family knows the name and image of Beatrice." `
`"That's because of the massive portrait hanging in the entrance hall, isn't it? `
`That portrait was first displayed in April of 1984." `
`"Seriously, ...how is it that you know so much? `
`...Ah, well. `
`It's about time I stopped finding that odd. `
`I'm sure you'll just start speaking in riddles again." `
`Lion was the Successor and lived in the Head Household. `
`That made conversations with Kinzo an everyday occurance. `
`Because of this, Lion must have been used to chatting with people who were moody or hard to follow. `
`With the understanding that getting stuck on the details would be nothing but a waste of time, `
`the conversation naturally fell into a pattern as though Lion and this unknown man Will were long-time friends... `
`"Everyone knows Beatrice. `
`And yet, no one knows her. `
`Kinzo's the only one who's ever met her." `
`"...The Head seems to be particularly cranky today. `
`I'll introduce you to him when the chance presents itself, so I ask that you develop an appropriately discreet attitude, Will-san." `
`"That was quick. `
`...I thought you'd resist a bit more than that." `
`"I'm used to speaking with the Family Head. `
`I've learned to accept most unreasonable situations and just go with the flow." `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} had set up a "barrier" cutting the chapel off from the rest of the world. `
`To destroy that, they would have to find out "who killed {f:5:Beatrice}". `
`For Lion, who had already experienced many of Kinzo's rantings, understanding this much was more than enough... `
