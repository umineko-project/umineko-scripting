`Two white pieces were set on the chessboard. `
`...The countless black pieces surrounding them were now just packed together, not even placed on the squares. `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} tipped the two white pieces over... `
`and took them off the board. `
`"Is it really okay to end it like this?" `
`"...Yes. `
`Yes, as usual, your reading truly does fall comfortably on my ears, my miko." `
`"As you wished, I've scraped out even the inner parts of the guts. `
`Was that enough of an answer check for you?" `
`"Indeed. `
`...I am quite satisfied. `
`Using the answer you have revealed as a key, I will go back through all the tales so far, `
`opening the closed rooms like treasure boxes, one by one." `
`"...It's fun finding the key. `
`And it's even more fun to stick it into all the locks. `
`You have done very well, my miko. `
`From now on, let me enjoy my thoughts alone. `
`This has been enough..." `
`The Witch of Theatergoing sat back in her rocking chair, a satisfied smile on her face, as though enjoying a pleasant aftertaste. `
`There was no need for a game board anymore. `
`She just had to go back in her mind, through the whole set of tales, to check whether her theory was right or not. `
`It seemed to leave her pleasantly drunk, even better than the most expensive wine... `
`"...Are you done with me now?" `
`"You have done well, my miko. `
`I absolve you of your duty. `
`...I will return to my slumber. `
`I'd like to enjoy this pleasant dream for a few more centuries." `
`"And when I grow tired of that, `
`...you will find yet another tale to keep me entertained. `
`...For those centuries, which will pass in the blink of an eye, `
`I grant you your freedom." `
`"Heheheheheh... `
`Splendidly done, {f:5:Bernkastel}, my cute, cute miko..." `
`"...It's not like I care. `
`Go ahead, dry up and die. `
`So long, for the rest of time." `
`"You call a few mere centuries "for the rest of time"? `
`*cackle*cackle*... `
`......" `
`{f:5:Featherine}'s consciousness slowly faded away. `
`As the owner of the study's slumber grew deeper, `
`...the lights about the room slowly darkened. `
`"Good night forever, Auaurora. `
`......You don't need this game board anymore. `
`I'll take it." `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} reached out towards Beato's game board, which lay on the table in front of {f:5:Featherine}'s rocking chair, and tapped it twice. `
`The game board and the pieces flew into the air, folded up and put themselves away, then landed on {f:5:Bernkastel}'s outstretched right hand. `
`"...I still haven't had a chance to do any real Game Mastering. `
`...I just did Beato's funeral. `
`That, and tearing out the guts. `
`...I still haven't done anything." `
`{f:5:Bernkastel}'s smile twisted evilly. `
`Then, the game board floated up once again, ...and a world unfolded itself above {f:5:Bernkastel}'s palm... `
`"Hey, pieces of Beato's game...? `
`I'm gonna have you spin a incredibly brutal tale that I'll find incredibly entertaining. `
`Tremble in fear of the certain fate you've been promised. `
`...By the name of {f:5:Bernkastel}, Witch of Miracles, `
`...and as the final Game Master of Beato's game, I proclaim it." `
`"...Though just saying it would be boring. `
`...Maybe I should follow Beato's rules and say it in red." `
`"Are you sure? `
`There might still be some witches with naive hopes." `
`"Ah, Lambda. So you're here? `
`Of course, you're always wherever I am." `
`"Go on and say it. `
`You tell those naive dreamers." `
`"Yes, I will. `
`......As the Witch of Miracles, and as the final Game Master, I proclaim the start of the final game... `
`and make you this promise." `
`{a:c: `
`{p:1:I won't give this game a happy ending.}} `
`*sob*. `
`...*sob*sob*... `
`A single girl...was crying in a desolate, quiet chapel. `
`She was a small girl. `
`...Only six years old. `
`The girl who would, for 12 years starting now, `
`lament the fact that she wasn't on this island during October 4th and 5th, 1986... `
`Then, `
`...a single man appeared... `
`The man noticed the girl, `
`walked up to her quietly, trying not to scare her, `
`...and put his arms gently around her shoulders... `
`"......Onii-chan......" `
`"I've been looking for you, Ange..." `
`The girl jumped into her big brother's chest and started crying again... `
`"What's wrong? `
`...Why are you so sad?" `
`"Today, a kid in class bullied me... `
`He said the people on TV were saying Mom had ties to bad people. `
`...So, he said that Mom and Dad were the culprits, and that they probably killed everyone... `
`...I asked Aunt Eva, hoping she'd say it wasn't true, but she didn't say anything... `
`...Mom and Dad aren't bad people, right? `
`Right...?" `
`"Poor kid... `
`...Everyone keeps saying whatever they like about what might've happened on that island on that day... `
`...Sit over here." `
`"......Okay..." `
`When the man pointed to the floor, a cloud of gold butterflies gathered there and created a chair. `
`The girl obediently sat down on it... `
`"...You know, don't you, Onii-chan? `
`You know that Mom and Dad aren't bad people, right?" `
`"Yeah. Of course I know that. `
`...I know that none of them were bad people." `
`"Then tell me. `
`What happened that day? `
`What happened on Rokkenjima?" `
`"Okay. `
`...I'll tell you. `
`This is what happened on that day." `
`"Is it...a scary story...?" `
`"Of course not." `
`"Is it a sad story...?" `
`"Not at all." `
`"Then...what kind of story is it...?" `
`"You can decide that for yourself when you hear it. `
`It definitely isn't a painful story. `
`So listen up." `
`"Okay, `
`Battler onii-chan..." `
`"On that day, we all went to Rokkenjima. `
`There were a lot of us. `
`It was an important day, the day of the family conference. `
`...Hmm, where should I begin?" `
`{a:c: `
`This is... `
`The final game, made just for Ange. `
`} `
`{a:c: `
`Listen, Ange. `
`This is what happened on Rokkenjima on that day. `
`It isn't sad or painful at all...... `
`} `
