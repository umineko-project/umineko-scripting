`The Ushiromiya family members were relaxing here and there around the waiting room. `
`A light buffet-style meal had been set up, but it was a bit stale, and not particularly appealing. `
`Even so, those voracious kids seemed to find it intensely interesting. `
`The cousins had set up camp around it, with Maria at the center. `
`The adult siblings had also formed a group in a different corner. `
`Perhaps because of Kinzo's absence, everyone seemed to be a little more relaxed. `
`"...Lion, `
`where did you go? `
`...And who is that?" `
`"Mother, `
`I was entertaining this guest of ours. `
`Will, this is my mother, Natsuhi." `
`"No introductions needed. `
`Just tell me what you have to say." `
`"Huh? Did you say something?" `
`"No, he said nothing. `
`This is Will-san. `
`It seems he knew the deceased." `
`With a smile, Lion casually smoothed over Will's words. `
`"He wants to know more about Beatrice. `
`...Do you know anything about her, Mother?" `
`"...... `
`...Lion, the departed is an individual to whom the Head owed a great debt. `
`Nothing more, nothing less. `
`This funeral is a ceremony for the Head to repay his benefactor for all he received while that person still lived. `
`That is what I have been told, and there is nothing more to it than that." `
`"...Thanks, Mother. `
`Will, that's all my mother knows." `
`Natsuhi was eager to deny the scandal about Beatrice being Kinzo's mistress. `
`However, she also had enough sense to realize that this scandal was probably true. `
`Picking up that Natsuhi was in a bad mood and didn't want to talk about this anymore, `
`Lion brought an end to that conversation before Will could say something rude again. `
`"Will, `
`this chapel belongs to the family." `
`"So you're telling me to follow the family's rules?" `
`"Speak in a manner appropriate for a guest of the family. `
`Let me be the medium for all of your conversations. `
`I ask that you follow those two rules." `
`"I'll work on that." `
`"...The mess this {f:5:Bernkastel} witch or whatever has dragged us into is a real pain. `
`Because of that, I'm willing to help you. `
`But we're equal partners in this job, and you'd best not forget that." `
`"And here I thought you were just some well-bred rich kid. `
`Seems you can speak up after all." `
`"I must be prepared to shoulder the Ushiromiya family's future, after all." `
`"......Got it. `
`Let's solve this crime together, Watson." `
`"I'm glad I can help. `
`I wouldn't want to keep your dear cat Diana waiting. `
`Won't she need to be fed soon?" `
`"I gave her extra food today, `
`so she should be good for a while. `
`......I'm surprised you realized Diana was a cat." `
`"I figured it'd be just a bit too eccentric for her to be a human woman who scratches at sofas when you keep her waiting." `
`"...Hmph." `
`"So? `
`Who will you talk to first?" `
`"Anyone. `
`Everyone. `
`...Those ones over there are Krauss's siblings, right?" `
`"From right to left, there's Aunt Eva, `
`Uncle Hideyoshi, `
`over there is Uncle Rudolf, `
`Aunt Kyrie, `
`and over there is-" `
`"Ushiromiya Rosa. `
`...When she was a girl, she once got lost in the forest and bumped into a woman calling herself Beatrice in a hidden mansion." `
`"...I know I shouldn't be surprised anymore, `
`but you really do know everything, don't you?" `
`"So, you know about that story too?" `
`"I managed to overhear her saying that today. `
`...It looked as though it was bothering her, so I pretended not to hear." `
`"Real model student, you are. `
`...Introduce me. `
`I want to ask about it." `
`"You're asking this of the model student who pretended not to hear because it just might be a painful topic?" `
`Even this outrageous arrogance is nothing compared to Kinzo. `
`After muttering this several times mentally, Lion shrugged and nodded at Will. `
`"Oh, it's our Successor-sama. `
`And who is this...?" `
`"Oh, Aunt Eva. `
`This is Will-san. `
`He came to offer flowers for the departed." `
`"But who cares about that. `
`Tell me everything you know about `
`...nngah-" `
`"He says he wants to know what sort of relationship the Ushiromiya family has had with the deceased." `
`Lion spoke with a bright smile after pinching Will's butt. `
`Will silently protested, as though saying "I saw that coming, but damn that hurt" `
`, but Lion just played dumb and smiled at Eva like a model student. `
`"Her connection to the Ushiromiya family? `
`"Well, `
`"It probably makes more sense to say "her relationship with Father"." `
`"No need to beat around the bush. `
`She was Father's mistress." `
`"If you call her that, Natsuhi nee-san will yell at you again. `
`He's "indebted" to her, right? `
`*giggle*" `
`"Yep, that's right. `
`Wahahahaha." `
`"...Well, there you have it." `
`"I have no interest in anyone but Rosa, `
`gghh-" `
`"I do believe...that you said you met with Beatrice, Aunt Rosa." `
`"........." `
`This whole time, Rosa had been hanging her head. `
`Lion's words made her shoulders quiver. `
`"She just suddenly came out with it today. `
`It's a bit hard to believe." `
`"It's the truth...! `
`I killed Beatrice!" `
`"Perfect, our work here is finished." `
`"Don't get ahead of yourself." `
`Rosa broke down crying and laid her head on the table. `
`Kyrie and Hideyoshi tried to console her... `
`"Rokkenjima is covered by a dense forest. `
`We only know about one tiny portion of it. `
`Just the mansion, the rose garden, `
`and the little path that leads to the harbor." `
`"For years, there's been stories about how Dad built a hidden mansion somewhere in the vast forest that no one knew about, `
`and that he had a mistress living there." `
`"Rosa-san probably stumbled on the hidden mansion by chance..." `
`"But Aunt Rosa, why would you say you killed Beatrice...?" `
`"If I hadn't taken her out with me, she never would have died...! `
`She was so innocent, like a chick. `
`I took her out, and she just followed along obediently! `
`She stayed right behind me, trusting me completely...! `
`And because I made her take such a dangerous path...!!" `
`"Did you make her walk that way because you were hoping she'd slip and fall from the cliff?" `
`"I never meant to do that! `
`I just thought she'd like to see the ocean...! `
`No, `
`it just looked like the path would be hard to walk, `
`and I thought it would be easier going if we went down the cliff first...!!" `
`"That's not what it means to kill someone. `
`It was an accident." `
`"An accident she never would have had if I hadn't brought her with me, right?! `
`It's my fault!! `
`And then, I abandoned her when she was covered in blood and ran home!!" `
`"It isn't your fault. `
`Beatrice had never seen the ocean before. `
`...You showed her that for the first time ever. `
`She was probably so excited that she just happened to take a bad step." `
`"...H-How can you know that...?" `
`"Beatrice might thank you for what you did, but she would never hate you." `
`"...... `
`Really? `
`...Is that... `
`really true...?" `
`"She's the one who begged to see the world outside the fence, right? `
`Though it was only for a short while, you made that dream of hers come true. `
`If I were Beatrice, I'd thank you for that short bit of time. `
`If she knew that you've been suffering all this time for it, she'd probably feel sorry for you." `
`"...Beatrice is grateful for what you did. `
`You're the one who taught her that the sea is blue." `
`"......Is that... `
`...true...?" `
`"I guarantee it." `
`Will made that statement openly and boldly. `
`It wasn't clear how Rosa took those words. `
`However, ...it had apparently been enough to remind Rosa to take a handkerchief out of her pocket and wipe her eyes with it. `
`"...Thank you." `
`"Those are the words Beatrice is whispering to you even now." `
`"......Thank you..." `
`Rosa wiped her eyes with the handkerchief one more time and hung her head. `
`It no longer looked like a fit of sobbing, but more as though she was speaking with the Beatrice of that day within her heart, `
`...one last time. `
`"...You really have no problem making claims you could never back up, don't you?" `
`"Back up? `
`Is that really necessary to comfort a woman?" `
`"...... `
`It seems I underestimated you." `
`How many years did it torment Rosa? `
`Now, finally, `
`...she would probably be able to face that innocently smiling Beatrice, who had seen the ocean for the first time in her life. `
`She was the only one who could forgive Rosa. `
`Now, the two of them could finally speak together... `
`"...I don't know who you are, but thank you. `
`...I wonder if she'll forgive me." `
`"You've worried about it for nearly 20 years. `
`That's far too long. `
`She'd tell you that you've suffered more than enough already." `
`"...That's right, Aunt Rosa. `
`The sadder you are, the sadder Beatrice would be." `
`"......You too... `
`Thank you. `
`...I don't know if I'll be forgiven, `
`...but I'll keep on speaking to my heart to see whether she'll forgive me or not. `
`...Thanks, you two. `
`Sorry for showing you such an embarrassing side of me." `
`"And I'm sorry to say this right after saying something so pretty, `
`...but I want you to talk to me. `
`Tell me what happened back then." `
`"...Will-san!" `
`"Thanks, but it's fine. `
`...I'll talk. `
`Hiding this and keeping quiet about it for so long might have been my greatest sin." `
`"Exactly when was it that you met Beatrice?" `
`Upon hearing this question, ...Rosa closed her eyes lightly, reaching back to a past she didn't want to remember... `
`"...It was about 20 years ago. `
`...20...or wait, it might have been 19 or 18 years ago. `
`...I'm sorry. `
`I've tried to force myself to forget it for so long that I've nearly forgotten that part completely." `
`"It should have been 1967." `
`Ronove had guaranteed that with the red truth in the 3rd game. `
`"Th-That's right... `
`It was probably about 1967. `
`I can remember what happened as clearly as a picture... `
`I'll never forget..." `
`"If it's tough for you, don't feel like you have to tell us." `
`"Yes, clear as a picture, if you don't mind. `
`......Ngah! `
`...Dammit, that hurts, Lion." `
`"What does?" `
`"At the time, I was in a state of shock, since my tutor told Mother about something that was supposed to be a secret. `
`On that day, I became reckless, and I kept on running deeper and deeper into the forest." `
`This tale has also been told in a previous Fragment. `
`Back when Rosa was just a kid, she went deep into the forest, `
`...found a hidden mansion, and met with a mysterious woman who called herself Beatrice... `
`"...But that forest is so thick, even pushing your way through a bit of it is hard, right?" `
`"I even surprised myself... `
`To think that I made it so far into such a dense forest. `
`...I was tormented by twigs and sharp leaves over and over again." `
`"However, that wasn't enough to bother me on that day. `
`...After all, I wanted to disappear into the forest and vanish forever. `
`...If, by some chance, there really was a witch's mansion in the depths of the forest, `
`...I hoped that she might take me to the some paradise, or else turn me into a frog and make me a resident of the forest." `
`"So, you then reached the hidden mansion, Kuwadorian, `
`and met a woman who called herself Beatrice." `
`"...Yes. `
`I met her." `
`"Was that Beatrice the same as the one in the portrait?" `
`"...... `
`...Yes. `
`They were the same person. `
`Beautiful blue eyes. `
`Golden hair. `
`A black dress. `
`It truly was the person in that portrait. `
`...When Father first had it hung, `
`...I realized that the 20 years I'd spent trying to forget...must have seemed just as long to Father, if not even longer, `
`and I became even more fearful of my sin..." `
`"Stop there. `
`...Are we sure that this is the same Beatrice that Rosa-san met?" `
`Immediately, Kyrie spoke the question that Will had been thinking of. `
`It would be too rash to assume that the Beatrice Kinzo met and the one Rosa met... `
`were the same person. `
`The time and generation didn't match up. `
`"Beatrice is supposed to be that lady of leisure who lent Dad all that gold shortly after the war, right?" `
`"By usin' Beatrice's gold as a foundation, Father revived the Ushiromiya family and got super rich. `
`Then he bought Rokkenjima and moved over. `
`Rosa-san meetin' her must've been at least 10 years after that." `
`"A woman who could do as she pleased with 10 tons of gold could hardly be some little girl. `
`And 10 more years passed before she met Rosa. `
`...Rosa, `
`about how old did the Beatrice you met look?" `
`"...She looked older than I was at the time, `
`...but even so, it looked as though she might just be reaching adulthood. `
`Yes, just the sort of age of the Beatrice in the portrait." `
`"Did she look middle-aged or past her prime?" `
`"If I had to call her an adult or a child, she was clearly closer to being a child. `
`There's no way she was middle-aged." `
`"And isn't that strange? `
`We have the Beatrice you met and the Beatrice who gave Father the gold, `
`but their ages don't match." `
`"In other words, they're different people." `
`"Different people...who look very similar and have the same name..." `
`"It might've been her daughter. `
`A kid would obviously end up lookin' like her mother." `
`"His mistress's daughter... `
`It is possible. `
`Perhaps Father had an illegitimate child with the Beatrice who gave him the gold." `
`"And then, Rosa bumped into Beatrice the Second. `
`...That way, the ages fit just fine." `
`"............" `
`"I see... `
`In other words, there are two people who can be called Beatrice." `
`Kinzo secretly raised his mistress's child in a hidden mansion. `
`It made sense. `
`Everyone nodded, agreeing. `
`...However, Will's expression was slightly unsatisfied, and he scratched at his head... `
`"So, it would seem that `
`this funeral exists for the two Beatrices he couldn't mourn, because they were kept secret..." `
`"Rosa, `
`I know you probably don't want to remember, but tell me about that accident. `
`After Beatrice fell, was she still breathing?" `
`"No. `
`...Her eyes were open wide. `
`She fell upside down, head first, and knocked her head against a sharp crag on the rocky beach. `
`And she fell from such a height... `
`Her skull had split and caved inwards. `
`...That beautiful golden hair was stained red with blood almost instantly..." `
`"Was it the sort of wound that clearly showed that she was dead?" `
`"Yes. `
`I saw the insides of her cracked head! `
`It had caved in deep enough to fit your fist inside it...! `
`No one could be naive enough to see that and still hope that she was alive!" `
`"...Will, `
`do you really need to ask anything more?" `
`"That's enough for the time of the accident. `
`What did you do afterwards?" `
`"I dashed away at full speed. `
`...I can't say I was thinking about calling for help. `
`...I wanted to escape from that place as fast as I could. `
`Half-crazed, sobbing, and out of breath, I kept on running about at random. `
`...Eventually, I came across a familiar lion statue." `
`"Oh, the one in front of the chapel?" `
`"No, the one behind it. `
`...Anyway, I made it back to the mansion. `
`I couldn't tell anyone, and I didn't want to. `
`I stayed quiet until nightfall. `
`It was so horrible of me. `
`If I had hurried and told someone, they might have brought her a first aid kit, and she might have been saved..." `
`"How is a first aid kit going to help with a crushed cranium? `
`...You didn't kill her. `
`Don't worry about that anymore." `
`"............" `
`"Then, ...what did you do next?" `
`"...That night, I turned over in my bed so many times. `
`I couldn't sleep. `
`...Late that night, I quietly... `
`...called Genji-san on the phone and told him..." `
`"...What did he say?" `
`"He told me to let him handle everything and to speak of this to no one. `
`...I spent the next several days terrified that Father would call for me and scold me brutally. `
`But...he didn't. `
`Genji-san kept on doing his job quietly, just like normal. `
`...Father stayed locked up in his study, not knowing any of it..." `
`"At the very least, none of us ever heard about it." `
`"...Genji-san probably managed to clean everything up nicely." `
`"After all, they couldn't let knowledge of that child go public..." `
`"Hmmmmm... `
`Even if she was an illegitimate child, she was still his daughter by blood. `
`It must've been tough for Father, not bein' able to hold a real funeral for her..." `
`"...I suppose that's why we're having this funeral." `
`"And then?" `
`"That's all I know." `
`"...... `
`And that's all I know too." `
`"I'm not hiding anything else. `
`I've told you everything. `
`...I swear it." `
`"............" `
`Will scratched at his head, letting his gaze wander. `
`It had taken Rosa a lot of determination to make this confession, but it was nothing particularly special for Will. `
`It had apparently been little more than a review of information he already knew... `
`"Thanks, Aunt Rosa. `
`...Is that enough for you, Will? `
`Are you satisfied?" `
`"That's enough. `
`It was a nice review." `
`To Will, Rosa's memories gave only information that was already known. `
`This was the first time he'd heard all that about her running back to the mansion after Beatrice fell to her death, `
`but none of it was particularly surprising. `
`Apparently, Rosa didn't know any more than this... `
`If he wanted to learn more than what was in the Fragments {f:5:Bernkastel} gave him, he would need to find new testimony. `
`"Lion, `
`tell Kinzo that I want to talk to him. `
`It looks like we won't get anywhere without asking the man himself." `
`"Where are you going?" `
`"...Off to cool my head and organize my thoughts. `
`Don't follow." `
`"Well then, pardon me. `
`Please take your time." `
`After giving an elegant bow, Lion made a face, tongue sticking out. `
`Unless Will had eyes on the back of his head, he couldn't have seen this last bit... `
`Will returned to the chapel by himself. `
`The cold air and the monotonous sound of the rain were comforting. `
`{a:c: `
`"...So, how's the game going?"} `
`And he had come here for a little peace and quiet... `
`As soon as he let out a sigh of relief, that voice rang out. `
`"That's my line." `
`It was as though she had been sitting there all along. `
`...{f:5:Bernkastel} appeared on top of the altar once more. `
`{f:5:Beatrice}'s altar must've been extremely comfortable. `
`"...Battler annoyed me over and over with his incompetence. `
`You're quite competent compared to him, so it's much more relaxing to watch you work." `
`"Unlike Ushiromiya Battler's games, I have nothing standing in my way. `
`It's easy." `
`"That sort of game has already ended. `
`Tales can be enjoyed twice. `
`First you love them. `
`Then you tear out their guts. `
`...*giggle*giggle*." `
`"Tch. So I'm a butcher now." `
`"So? `
`Do you think you've figured out who killed {f:5:Beatrice}...?" `
`"Rosa's confession is something I already know from a previous Fragment. `
`There was no brand-new information. `
`...We're still at square one." `
`"*giggle*giggle*..." `
`"Unless Ushiromiya Kinzo tells us what really happened, we won't get any further than this. `
`Don't tell me that arguing with Kinzo and persuading him to spill the beans `
`is supposed to be part of this game." `
`"That'd be fatally boring. `
`...Kinzo refuses to speak of the truth and is himself the king protected by his castle, `
`but it wouldn't be any fun to have that stand in the way of your game..." `
`"...I won't torture. `
`It's not my style." `
`"I know. `
`As the Game Master, I will grant you power. `
`So that you can get the truth from Kinzo, of course." `
`Still wearing shoes, {f:5:Bernkastel} stepped into the casket, picked up one of the flowers that had been set as offerings, `
`...and blew hard, as though scattering fluff from a dandelion. `
`Then, a single petal broke off and drifted down towards Will, `
`no longer gold, but with the shine of a transparent crystal... `
`"The "detective's authority"?" `
`"Hmph, what, that pathetic ability? `
`...No. `
`This is an invitation to the grandstands." `
`"..."Theatergoing authority"? `
`...That's supposed to be forbidden without authorization from the Senate." `
`"I'm the one giving it. On my game board. `
`Who's going to stop me...?" `
`"...Hmph." `
`Though the crystal flower petal danced in the wind, it wouldn't fly away until Will accepted it. `
`He remembered how useless it was to argue with witches and snatched it up. `
`When he did, the petal flashed brightly for an instant, melted into Will's palm, and disappeared... `
`"Entertain me if you can. `
`And try and enjoy yourself. `
`...You must also be interested in seeing what the guts of {f:5:Beatrice}'s game board look like, right?" `
`"Not really." `
`After Will's rude answer, `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} vanished into thin air, leaving behind an obnoxious laugh... `
`"...Tch." `
`After clicking his tongue, Will turned around unhappily. `
`...When he did, it felt as though his gaze had crossed that of a shadow standing right in front of him, near the door that led outside. `
`"Who is it?" `
`"Ah, ...p-pardon me... `
`I heard a voice, s-so I wondered who it was..." `
`"Ah, Shannon. `
`So you're running the reception desk this time...?" `
`"Yes. `
`I've been taking it in turns with Kanon-kun to run the reception desk..." `
`"And Kanon?" `
`"A short while ago, he was ordered by, umm, `
`...L-Lion-sama to take a break, so he's resting now." `
`"...So, you don't know Lion either?" `
`"Huh? `
`...No, that's not..." `
`"Ushiromiya Lion is the Successor, the one who wears the silver ring. `
`...Why are you stumbling over that name when you've worked here for 10 years?" `
`"...Th-That's..." `
`"Don't worry. `
`I don't recognize Lion either. `
`...Krauss is supposed to be the Successor. `
`Jessica is supposed to be his only child. `
`There hasn't been a single Fragment with anyone named Lion in the Ushiromiya family." `
`When she realized that Will didn't recognize Lion either, Shannon relaxed. `
`Apparently, she was a bit relieved to find that she wasn't going crazy by herself. `
`...However, her expression quickly grew uncertain once more. `
`"Wh-Where...is this place...? `
`I think it's the Ushiromiya family chapel. `
`...However, something feels different about it. `
`Also, I never knew that someone named L-Lion-sama existed. `
`...And yet Madam, Krauss-sama, ...the Master, Milady, and all the relatives all talk as though it's perfectly natural... `
`I just...don't understand what's happening..." `
`"...Lion is a piece placed by {f:5:Bernkastel}. `
`She also said that, in order to place that piece, she switched over to a larger cat box. `
`...On top of that, it seems this world isn't a proper world, but one made out of several different Fragments sewn together." `
`It's as though...this is a special stage set up specifically for this game. `
`...I'm sure she's nodding at my thoughts right now, laughing and chomping down popcorn. `
`"How long have you worked here in this world?" `
`"...T-Ten years." `
`I see. `
`So it really is a special stage. `
`After all, right when I entered the chapel, I spotted Kinzo. `
`Since Shannon has been working here for 10 years, this world takes place in 1986, the stage of Beato's game. `
`In that case, Kinzo shouldn't exist. `
`However, he definitely was here a few minutes ago. `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} promised that all of the information needed for reasoning was gathered here. `
`She must've really packed it together to fit everything in... `
`I see, so it really is a special stage. `
`"You've served the Ushiromiya family for many years. `
`So, just how much do you know about Beatrice?" `
`"...I know the Master loved her deeply, but other than that..." `
`"Is that all?" `
`"A-And, umm, `
`......they say that she's the master of Rokkenjima's night `
`...umm..." `
`"That's right. `
`The name of the ghost rumored to wander the mansion night after night is also {f:5:Beatrice}." `
`That brings the number of Beatrices to three. `
`The first is the Beatrice from more than 30 years ago, who is said to have given Kinzo the gold. `
`The second is the Beatrice from 20 years ago, who met Rosa. `
`The third is the {f:5:Beatrice} of the ghost stories, who is rumored to be the master of the night on Rokkenjima. `
`"...Furudo Erika's reasoning was probably correct. `
`It started out as a legend of evil spirits on Rokkenjima. `
`Later on, elements such as Kinzo's occult hobbies, the name and portrait of the mysterious woman, Beatrice, `
`and the epitaph got mixed in, and it was all integrated into the Legend of the Golden Witch." `
`"...Then, the darkness of the night gained the personality of a witch. `
`That's the third {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`This became the veil for the serial murders." `
`"...Uh, umm......" `
`Apparently, she didn't understand a word of Will's sudden monologue. `
`Shannon tried to follow along, but she seemed to be having difficulty. `
`"Don't waste your time trying to understand. `
`You'll just get a headache." `
`"M-My apologies..." `
`"Kanon doesn't know Lion either, right?" `
`"......Yes. `
`Kanon-kun was the same as me." `
`Shannon...and Kanon, is it... `
`"...... `
`...Call Kanon over here. I want to talk to the pair of you about something." `
`When Will said these words, Shannon's face went blank and her eyes went wide. `
`"My apologies. `
`We aren't allowed to leave the reception desk unmanned, so I can't leave to go get him." `
`"Then find a replacement and have them take over the reception desk until you get back. `
`You, me, and Kanon. `
`...We, the three people who don't know Lion, need to talk." `
`"..............." `
`"........." `
`"...We've been told that one person is enough to run the reception desk." `
`"But no one told you there was anything wrong with two people manning it, right?" `
`"We're low on helpers today, so we were told that having two people at the reception desk would be unnecessary." `
`"Who gave you that order? `
`Kinzo? Krauss? `
`Or was it Lion? `
`I will check with them." `
`"It was...the one who orders me. `
`I cannot disobey or{f:5:ders}." `
`"Who is this person? `
`I'll negotiate with them." `
`"You cannot...{f:5:negotiate}. `
`It i{f:5:s} the o{f:5:ne} who or{f:5:ders us}." `
`"Call Kanon over here. `
`...I hate theatergoing just as much as I hate torture." `
`Slowly, ...Will pulled his right hand out of his pocket. `
`When he slowly opened his fist, `
`......a small, bright glow emanated from it. `
`The flower petal given to him by {f:5:Bernkastel} had become a glowing, sparkling mark on his hand... `
`He held that hand out towards Shannon...and slowly approached her. `
`"Call Kanon. `
`I want to check something with you two." `
`"{f:5:I ca  nnot call him. Do you sti  ll... want me to}...?" `
`"If you don't call him, I'm going to use my authority." `
`"{f:5:If you insi  st, ......I can c al   l him speci ally for  you, but}..." `
`"............" `
`"       ." `
`There was some kind of incomprehensible tension between the two. `
`Will stood there, his left hand still in his pocket and his right palm glowing and stretched out towards her. `
`Shannon just stood there, her hands still folded politely in front of her, `
`...her posture beautiful. `
`And yet, ...it felt oddly as though windswept drops of rain were sparking and crackling in midair... `
`"{o:0:{e:85:{f:0:{g:0:{m:6:I WI}{m:15:LLG}{m:31:OCA}{m:0:LL KAN}{m:21:ON‐K}{m:22:UN.}}}}}" `
`"{o:0:{e:85:{f:0:{g:0:{m:13:ARE YO}{m:26:U ABSOLUTELY}{m:41:cer}{m:71:TAIN?}}}}}" `
`"........." `
`Will's expression had remained unchanged the whole time. `
`Shannon's face was still kind and gentle. `
`And yet, the tension was as icy as a frozen lake... `
`...Beginners in chess will sometimes move their king into check without noticing it. `
`One might mercilessly capture the king in this situation, ...but high-level players are supposed to calmly tell their opponent about their mistake. `
`'If you take one more step, `
`...you'll get captured'. `
`This was...similar to that... `
`"........." `
`...I see. `
`So, after all... `
`"I get it. `
`That's enough. `
`...You guys can take it in turns to run the reception desk." `
`Slowly, ...Will lowered his hand. `
`"Thank you for understanding." `
`The glow slowly vanished from Will's palm. `
`That completely incomprehensible tension melted away... `
`...like a sugar cube in water. `
`However, nothing had changed since the beginning. `
`Will's expression and Shannon's expression...were the same as they always had been. `
`"Oh, are you leaving?" `
`Footsteps approached them. `
`It was Lion. `
`"Just having a casual conversation. `
`I wanted to ask her something." `
`"...What could that be? `
`Did you find what you were looking for?" `
`"...... `
`Yeah." `
`"I'm honored to have been of service." `
`"........." `
`"That's a shame. `
`If you were looking for an umbrella, I could've gotten you one right away." `
`"Did you convince Kinzo?" `
`"...I told him that a rare guest wanted to greet him. `
`He says he'll meet with you." `
`"Did you tell him that I wanted to ask about Beatrice?" `
`"Isn't that your job?" `
`With a slightly mischievous look, Lion turned away. `
`Will scratched his head and shrugged, looking annoyed. `
`"...Ah, well. `
`Guess I'll get a chance to try this out at least." `
`Will opened his right hand and showed it to Lion. `
`It was just a hand, without anything remotely remarkable about it. `
`Lion's head tilted to the side in bafflement at this strange gesture. `
`"Good work. `
`...Umm, `
`...wait, your name was..." `
`"It's Shannon." `
`"That's right, Shannon. `
`Please take over at the reception desk. `
`And make sure you keep warm." `
`"Thank you very much, Lion-sama." `
`Shannon bowed deeply in response to Lion's kind words. `
`There was not even a trace of tension in her manner... `
`"Let's go, Will. `
`You don't want to miss this chance. `
`...The Head's mood changes quicker than the autumn sky." `
`"Good luck." `
`"...Here we go." `
