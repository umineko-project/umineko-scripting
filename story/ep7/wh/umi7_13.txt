`"Did you check the bathroom amenities?" `
`"Yep, went down the whole list." `
`"Did you make sure they were facing the right way when you set them down?" `
`"Yes, of course. `
`Everything's as the list says." `
`"*giggle* Thanks. `
`Genji-sama, the guest rooms are ready now." `
`"Good work. `
`Make sure you check over everything with your own eyes, Shannon. `
`Also, Madam has ordered us to change the tablecloth in the dining hall again." `
`"My, my. Why again, when we all worked so hard to change it earlier today...?" `
`"The color of that tablecloth simply does not fit. `
`Once I saw it against the backdrop of the room, I could see that it matched terribly. `
`We should use a different tablecloth." `
`"Oh, and did you make sure to clean the chandelier in the parlor? `
`I don't want Eva-san looking up and saying `
`"Oh, is that dust? And even a spiderweb?" again...!" `
`"Do not worry. `
`It has already been carefully cleaned and checked. `
`I will now perform a final check on everything myself." `
`"Is that so? Very well. `
`I will also check everything over at the very end. `
`Shannon, take the young servants and prepare a new tablecloth. `
`Try to find something white, with a bit more of a clean feeling." `
`"Y-Yes, as you wish." `
`Natsuhi was even more high-strung than normal and walked about barking orders here and there. `
`Even though the sky was beginning to get dark, the servants moved hurriedly about. `
`Tomorrow is the annual family conference. `
`It isn't particularly rare for each of the individual families to visit the island, but this is the only time that they all come together. `
`It was the most important day of the year for both the Ushiromiya family and Rokkenjima. `
`Natsuhi, who was short-tempered on top of being high-strung, kept ordering that the servants redo this or that, `
`since it really didn't look good after all. This would keep them going until late into the night. `
`Now that Shannon had many years of experience and Natsuhi had put her in a position of responsibility, `
`she was called over many times to have strict orders showered on her... `
`So, when Shannon finished her shower and lay down on the bed in the servant waiting room, she fell asleep almost immediately... `
`...I can hear the sound of wind...coming from somewhere far away. `
`...It's a bit different from the sound wind outside a room would make. `
`It's almost as though...I'm sitting in a deck chair in the rose garden, `
`turning over in my sleep, ...with the feel of the wind in my hair. `
`That's right, the feel. `
`...This isn't a sound, it's a feeling. `
`Then is this... `
`a dream...? `
`Just as I was about to accept this theory, ...I thought I heard someone talking to me. `
`"My, my. `
`It seems the work of a servant is just as boring as it ever was. `
`Not only boring, but difficult, strict, constraining, joyless... `
`All you get in return for your years of service is some level of respect from the newer servants. `
`And even that is far from sufficient to repay you for all the hard work you've done... `
`{a:c:`	
`"Why do you not tire `
`of this life?"} `
`Huh? ...Who...? `
`She wasn't just imagining someone talking to her. `
`...She was shocked to find that it was real. `
`When Shannon opened her eyes, ...she gulped. `
`"...Th- `
`This place......" `
`She couldn't say any more. `
`...She was literally stunned silent. `
`Shannon, who had been sleeping on a bed, ...was somehow in a rose garden. `
`However, though this rose garden somehow resembled the rose garden on Rokkenjima, it was also completely different. `
`After all, ...the roses were golden. `
`And it wasn't just the flowers, but the dancing butterflies too. `
`It was a golden rose garden of mysterious beauty. `
`Somehow, Shannon was sitting in a chair under the arbor. `
`It was as though she'd taken a nap there and woken up from a dream. `
`...But it felt strange. `
`Is this golden rose garden a dream? `
`For some strange reason, it felt as though my entire life up to this point had been a dream, `
`and that I had finally awakened here... `
`{a:c:`	
`"Welcome, Shannon. `
`Welcome to my golden rose garden..."} `
`There was that voice again. `
`Shannon looked around to find who it was. `
`As she did, a golden butterfly landed on the seat across from her and instantly created a human form... `
`"It has been quite some time, Shannon. `
`Have you been well...? `
`Of course, I know you have been. `
`After all, I have been watching all of you, every day." `
`This woman laughed as though she was an old friend of Shannon's. `
`However, Shannon obviously didn't remember this strange gold rose garden, and she didn't remember this person's face either... `
`"Indeed. `
`You no longer remember me, do you?" `
`"......Have I forgotten about you...? `
`If so, please forgive me..." `
`"There is no need to apologize. `
`I made you that way, so it is no sin of yours. `
`...Let me introduce myself. `
`I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}." `
`"...B-Beatrice...sama...? `
`Th-The benefactor of the Ushiromiya family, whom the Master always speaks of...?" `
`"Not that Beatrice. `
`I am the Golden Witch, the one who rules over Rokkenjima's night. `
`...I am the other master of the mansion, the one you always pay homage to." `
`"Y- `
`You are... `
`{f:5:Beatrice}... `
`sama..." `
`"Hahaha... `
`You need not fear. `
`The two of us used to be friends...no, roommates, did we not? `
`At one time, I idolized you and tried to be the best servant I could." `
`"...I've always had a single-person room, so I couldn't have had a..." `
`"When we last parted, I stole away your memory. `
`However, I have not forgotten that we were once roommates. `
`...I also remember that I was the one who destroyed our friendship and left." `
`"So as to not leave you alone in sadness, `
`I erased all of your memories and the very world of our days together." `
`"............" `
`"You do not need to understand... `
`But believe this. `
`I have not called you here to do you harm." `
`"I-Isn't this inside one of my dreams...?" `
`"You may think of it that way. `
`Strictly speaking, I beckoned your soul to my garden while you were sleeping. `
`To invite you to be a resident of this world." `
`{f:5:Beatrice} snapped her fingers, `
`and a storm of gold butterflies all rose up around the rose garden. `
`As the cloud of butterflies danced over the table, a gorgeous tea set appeared. `
`There were tea cups and a tea pot, more elegant even than those used by the Ushiromiya family. `
`The tea was filled to the brim and had a sweet rose scent, one which Shannon had never smelled before. `
`Before there was even time to be amazed by that scent, `
`butterflies started gathering one by one on the table, and a tea stand sprouted right out of it. `
`It was like watching a magical mushroom from a fairy tale kingdom grow out of the ground. `
`It was a many-layered tea stand, filled with beautiful cakes, like edible jewels. `
`Of course, there were also several lovely, light-brown scones. `
`The honey truly was golden honey, with bits of gold leaf dancing through it... `
`"It seems the Ushiromiya family holds tea parties from time to time, but those cannot compare to mine." `
`"...I-Incredible... `
`I've never seen anything like this..." `
`"*cackle*cackle* `
`Even if you did, it would only have been as a waitress. `
`You are my friend. `
`I need no waitress. `
`After all, I am a witch. `
`That is more than enough. `
`Come, do not be shy. `
`Stuff yourself to your heart's content." `
`"Th... `
`...Thank you... `
`very much..." `
`That was all Shannon managed to say. `
`...It would be hard for anyone to say much more after being suddenly invited to such a beautiful witch tea party. `
`"Let us begin with black tea. `
`The milk is fresh, and the sugar is so delectable that you'd almost want to eat it raw. `
`But I recommend you try your tea straight first. `
`With nothing more than a single rose petal floating on the top, `
`it will surely be so delicious that you'll be unable to drink the black tea of the human world ever again...!" `
`Laughing happily, {f:5:Beatrice} opened, not a sugar pot, but a rose petal pot, `
`picked up a single crimson petal, and floated it on her tea after relishing its scent. `
`Shannon did the same, picking up a single petal and smelling its aroma. `
`"...It smells so wonderful... `
`...Is this...really the scent of the roses in this world?" `
`"I am glad you enjoy it. `
`I bred this rose simply for the purpose of using the petals with black tea. `
`If you crush them, they're also splendid for making jam! `
`That goes better with scones than anything else imaginable. `
`Do you want to try?" `
`"Uh, ah...sure, just a bit." `
`Shannon had been invited to this witch tea party suddenly. `
`However, the witch seemed so truly innocent, and her smile as she played the hostess was so happy that it made Shannon want to smile too. `
`The tension in Shannon's heart gradually faded, and she started to enjoy her chat with this witch... `
`"Servant work really is tiring. `
`I remember it well. `
`Particularly cleaning the windowsills in the chapel." `
`"How surprising. `
`So, you worked as a servant once too?" `
`"For a short time. `
`You probably don't remember, but I worked alongside you. `
`I was a clumsy fool who always lost things. `
`You were my idea of a perfect servant, and the person I looked up to." `
`"...That makes me even more sorry that I can't remember." `
`"There is no need for apologies. `
`Here, you are not a servant, but my friend and guest. `
`There are no inconveniences here, no trials nor boredom. `
`I can give you anything you desire. `
`That is how much power I currently possess. `
`...I wanted to let you know that I have now reached that level." `
`"...I'm truly grateful to you `
`for welcoming one with so few redeeming features in such an extravagant way." `
`"*cackle*! `
`Think of it as a reward for all of the painful days you have withstood. `
`Come, gold butterflies! `
`Don't let my friend get bored! Show her a little dance! `
`When you have tired of that, allow me to call the band to perform any song you would like. `
`When you have tired of that, my refined familiars will show you some conjuring tricks. `
`Fear not, for time is endless here. `
`And I can grant your wishes endlessly. `
`My tea party has no end...!" `
`In a truly good mood, the witch told Shannon several strange stories. `
`They were all stories Shannon had never heard before. `
`Very interesting stories. `
`And, they were all odd, bizarre fairy tales. `
`Shannon felt as though she had become Alice in Wonderland. `
`The time she spent at this tea party was strange, pleasant, and relaxed. `
`No, `
`the clocks have no hands at this tea party. `
`So, the time passed like a Sunday morning, when you can wrap yourself in your blanket for as long as you want... `
`"...I can't express how grateful I am to you for this." `
`"There is no need for thanks. `
`In the human world, words of thanks go along with words of farewell, do they not? `
`There will be no end to this tea party. `
`So, there is no need for thanks either." `
`"*giggle* `
`I'll still thank you. `
`Thank you so much, {f:5:Beatrice}-sama, for this wonderful tea party. `
`...But all dreams must end, and so must this one." `
`"Hoh. `
`And why must they end?" `
`"Because, ...I start early tomorrow. `
`If I stay here talking too long, I'll sleep in, `
`and Madam will give me a good scolding..." `
`"Pft, hahhahhahahahhaahahahahaha! `
`Why are you so anxious to return to the world of that short-tempered Natsuhi? `
`Really, now. `
`Are you truly saying you want to return to the Human world, where it's all work and no rewards?" `
`"But I am Human. `
`I can't impose myself on you forever." `
`"Shannon, `
`it seems that you do not understand. `
`I invited you here, but I have no desire to chase you away again." `
`"Here, time is eternal. `
`You are not obligated to say farewell, not ever. `
`I will never tire of enjoying tea with you. `
`On the contrary, it is quite agreeable to have you here to talk to." `
`"I'm grateful for your words, but I am Human. `
`I must return to my own world." `
`"Why do you want to return to that colorless world, `
`where you waste all your time with school and your job and the family works you to the bone?" `
`"Despite all that, ...it's still my world." `
`"Shannon, `
`does that sort of world really need to be yours? `
`Let me be honest with you. `
`...Shannon, `
`I didn't just invite you here. `
`I came to take you home." `
`"Take me home...?" `
`"Once, I tried to become a good servant like you. `
`...Then, I became fascinated by witches `
`and became one myself, learning all the pleasures of magic. `
`...And now, I have come to take you home." `
`{f:5:Beatrice} spoke quietly and slowly rose from her seat. `
`"Shannon, `
`...the world of witches truly is more fun than being a servant. `
`This tea party is nothing more than a mere welcoming party for an old friend. `
`We can hold as many fun festivities as we desire. `
`That is the endless, the eternal." `
`"...Now that this golden rose garden has been completed, I have reached my goal. `
`This place is paradise. `
`Yes, let us call it the Golden Paradise. `
`Now that it has been completed, I have come to welcome you in. `
`There's no need for any inconveniences, any perseverance or hard work. `
`Here, you and I can enjoy ourselves for all eternity. `
`It will be like a never-ending fairy tale..." `
`"...I'm truly grateful for your splendid proposal. `
`...However, I need to go back to my original world." `
`"Why?" `
`"Because this isn't my world." `
`"I acknowledge it. `
`This is not the world you have lived in until now. `
`That's why I have invited you here! `
`From this point forth, this will be our world. `
`You are no longer a guest. `
`You are the second master of this world. `
`You need show no restraint for my sake. `
`We'll just live in this endless world like we once lived as roommates..." `
`"I regret that I have no memory of that time. `
`...However, I'll have to turn down your invitation." `
`"Why? `
`...What responsibility forces you to return `
`to the world of Humans?" `
`True, the world of Humans, or the world of servants, is busy all the time. `
`Madam is strict, high-strung, and has a short temper. `
`It'd be a lie if I said the everyday chores weren't a pain, and having to balance work with school makes it even harder. `
`{f:5:Beatrice} had watched over Shannon's painful days the whole time. `
`She had seen those constantly tired shoulders heave in a sigh over and over. `
`That was why she had invited Shannon here. `
`To this Golden Paradise. `
`She had tried to give Shannon a perfect welcome, to truly make her happy. `
`...So why had Shannon selected her original world over this one? `
`{f:5:Beatrice} was overcome with shock and completely unable to understand. `
`"I have given you the perfect welcome to this paradise. `
`And the days to follow will be even more fun." `
`"...So, since you still choose the Human world over all of that, do you find something there that is even more fun than the pleasures of witches?" `
`"...That's right. `
`There are things in the Human world that are even more fun than magic." `
`"Absurd... That cannot be...!" `
`"...Yes, `
`it's true." `
`Shannon's expression was soft. `
`However, her words were firm. `
`There was something wonderfully fascinating in the Human world. `
`And, that something was apparently not in this paradise, where everything was supposedly just as they wanted it... `
`"......Absurd... `
`...I don't... `
`understand..." `
`As {f:5:Beatrice} muttered, she shifted restlessly several times. `
`However, no matter how often she said it, Shannon's smile didn't falter, and {f:5:Beatrice} couldn't think of an answer... `
`"In that case, ...it's time for me to leave. `
`Your tea was delicious." `
`"......I don't...understand. `
`...I am the great Golden Witch, the one who can have anything endlessly. `
`You tell me that I cannot give you what you want?" `
`"......Yes." `
`"I want to know. `
`I believed I had everything, so tell me what it is I lack...!" `
`"I think...that you already know. `
`Isn't that why you invited me here...?" `
`"...Are you trying to speak in riddles to a witch? `
`...Heh, ...*cackle*." `
`"That's all for now then... `
`I can't live here, but I would be glad to come over whenever you invite me for tea." `
`"I won't call for you again... `
`Have no fear of that." `
`{f:5:Beatrice} snapped her fingers, and Shannon popped out of existence. `
`Shannon's soul had returned to the dream of her original self. `
`While humans have many dreams in a night, they can remember none of them. `
`The tea party in this paradise mixed in with many other dreams and vanished. `
`The next morning, Shannon would not remember this tea party. `
`However, Shannon's cup remained here. `
`The witch who had lost her guest and was standing alone looked all the more lonely... `
`"............" `
`The witch dug her fingernails into the tablecloth. `
`That grimace as she bit her lower lip made it clear... `
`that she still hadn't solved the puzzle Shannon had left behind. `
`"Riiche, `
`there's no need to worry about it." `
`A black hole opened above Shannon's empty seat, and the owner of that voice fell out of it. `
`"...I do worry. `
`Ah, come on, how could she say it with such certainty..." `
`"Maybe she just wanted to get back to sleep quickly, since dawn is coming soon." `
`"...What pleasure could Shannon know that I do not?! `
`What is this "something" that can be found in the Human world but not in my paradise?! `
`I don't understand! `
`...I want to know!" `
`"Thinking about complicated stuff will just fuel your headache. `
`I can be of service in Shannon's place. `
`Let's enjoy a tea party together." `
`"I don't feel like it anymore. `
`...I'm bored of having tea parties with you." `
`"...Aw, she's cranky." `
`The witch shrugged and laughed, then took a bite out of a scone. `
`She then blew into it, and it swelled up like a balloon before finally popping. `
`Golden ribbons and butterflies flew out, but {f:5:Beatrice} didn't appear to notice... `
`"...Just what is it that I do not possess? `
`...What...?" `
`"Watch your step there." `
`"Thank you, captain. `
`Make sure you take good care of yourself." `
`"I've got a friend who sells this stuff that's supposed to be great for stiff shoulders. `
`I'll bring you a sample next time...!" `
`"Oh, no need to trouble yourself... But thanks for caring." `
`"Hey, brats! `
`How long are you gonna mess around up there? `
`Let's go." `
`"Hey, Maria. `
`Come down off the boat with Mama..." `
`Maria, who Rosa led by the hand, was still too young for kindergarten. `
`However, she seemed to notice that her cousins, whom she rarely ever saw, were playing all around her, and she was very excited. `
`Battler and George had the energy of middle-school or nearly middle-school kids. `
`Those two, along with Jessica, who had met them on Niijima, were clambering about on the boat. `
`"You okay, Asumu? `
`...You really don't like riding things, do you..." `
`Rudolf lent an arm to his wife, Asumu... `
`"...Welcome to Rokkenjima. `
`Thank you for making such a long journey." `
`The whole family had gathered for the conference. `
`At this point in time, Rudolf's wife was still Asumu, and Ange hadn't been born. `
`Gohda and Kanon hadn't yet been employed by the Ushiromiya family, `
`and the witch's epitaph, which would toy with the family's fate, hadn't appeared yet. `
`They probably couldn't even imagine `
`the bizarre crime that they would encounter several years later... `
`"Krauss-sama, Madam. `
`The family has arrived." `
`"Good... `
`Should I call for Father?" `
`"Please do. `
`I will go welcome everyone. `
`...Oh, Shannon. `
`Who cleaned this window frame?! `
`It still has dust on it...! `
`Quickly, wipe it off!" `
`"A-As you wish, Madam." `
`...Oh, come on. Natsuhi's making her work so hard again. `
`Just what good does she find in such a limited, ulcer-inducing life? `
`I wanted to know. `
`...Shannon, `
`what is it that you found? `
`And what did you mean when you said I already knew what I was missing? `
`Shannon, `
`is this something I must learn by learning about you...? `
`"What's different about the day of the family conference on Rokkenjima?!" `
`"It's gotta be the noise! `
`There's never this many kids around!" `
`"...It may have been a tension-filled day for the adults, `
`but to us kids, it was a wonderful day, the only time we got to see all of the cousins we loved." `
`"In the summer, we'd play with our cousins on the beach, and even in the winter, there were plenty of games we could play! `
`The family conferences were tons of fun for us." `
`"Same here. `
`Mom was always yelling about how there must be no mistakes, `
`but to me, it was just the day I got to play with all my cousins. `
`After all, there's usually nothing at all to do on Rokkenjima." `
`"Back when I was still a little brat, `
`I was always jealous of Jessica, getting to live in this huge mansion with a private beach. `
`But now that I try putting myself in her shoes, it must've been a pretty constricting place to live." `
`"Probably... `
`There's hardly anything on Rokkenjima. `
`No friends' houses, no next door neighbors, no neighborhood. `
`If you think of how Jessica must have felt, you have to feel a little sad for her." `
`"That's why the family conference was so special to me. `
`Jumping around, messing around! `
`It felt like I was at a festival. `
`We played tricks on each other all the time." `
`"If the adults always talked about adult things and told you to go play somewhere else..." `
`"Then you were three cousins at about the same age. `
`Of course you'd horse around!" `
`"No, not the three of us. `
`The four of us." `
`"But I thought Ange wasn't born yet, and Maria was still too young to play with you?" `
`"You've got it wrong, Furfur. `
`The cousins weren't the only ones at the same age." `
`"Shannon-chan was the fourth. `
`She was about the same age as the rest of us." `
`"Mom was always going on about not talking with the servant kids, `
`but Shannon and I started to get close. `
`After all, she was the girl closest to me in age on Rokkenjima." `
`"All four of us played together. `
`We played at every family conference. `
`Right, Shannon?" `
`"...Right. `
`I knew that Madam would scold me if she found out, but..." `
`"I wouldn't have let her! `
`You were always the one close friend I had who could understand me...!" `
`"Thank you for your words, ...Milady..." `
`I simply could not hide my shock. `
`How had she formed a relationship with the children of the family, despite being only a servant? `
`Natsuhi had probably been very careful to prevent such a relationship. `
`However, it's no surprise that Jessica, all alone on this island, `
`would want to be friends with a kid her age. `
`And Shannon was also alone on this island, without any friends her age. `
`Though they both understood their relationship as master and servant, they somehow managed to strike up a friendship... `
`Then, at the family conference, Jessica had introduced Shannon to George and Battler. `
`All of the adults had their hands full with their complicated discussion in the mansion. `
`During that time, Shannon was able to set aside her role as a servant for a little bit, `
`acting her age with Jessica, George, and Battler. `
`I didn't even know that Shannon had constructed this new world so quickly. `
`As a butterfly hiding in the shadows, `
`...I observed this new world of Shannon's. `
`"That day, we ran all around the rose garden and the beach." `
`"Just running around and playing was a blast." `
`"Yep. `
`Those were the only times that Shannon-chan smiled like a girl her age." `
`"I might have...gotten a bit carried away. `
`It's embarrassing..." `
`"Battler's insanely huge now, but back then, Shannon and I were both taller and stronger than him." `
`"I just grew slowly back then." `
`"*giggle* `
`They say that those who start late end up the tallest." `
`"Ihihi! `
`Yeah, totally! `
`Back then, your chest was nothing like this, right?" `
`"That's not true... `
`Shannon already had plenty of womanly charm back then. Right?" `
`"U, ah...wh-who knows..." `
`"What the hell do you mean by "womanly charm", you perv?!" `
`"Well, I was still pretty cute back then myself. `
`That bra strap you could see through the shoulder of her summer clothing set off the lightning of youth in me...! `
`I remember whispering with George-aniki that night about how big her tits might be! Ihihi!" `
`"I-Is this true, George-sama...?!" `
`"*cough*, *cough*cough*!! `
`I believe there has been some sort of misunderstanding...! `
`A-All I remember was lecturing him, as the older and more knowledgeable cousin, about the differences between how boys and girls grow, *cough*cough*!! `
`And so, rather than dirty talk between cousins late at night, it was, instead, a sign of healthy growth and, umm..." `
`"...Yeah, I remember all of us cousins talking about stuff like that until midnight... `
`...About how apparently, someone in the next class had kissed someone else, `
`or how you held hands with a girl you liked at summer camp... `
`And about so-and-so who you thought probably liked you, stuff like that...! `
`...Dammit, it's so embarrassing it makes me shiver...!" `
`"Isn't that nice! `
`Another sweet page in the book of adolescence!" `
`"The most pure love comes when boys and girls first start noticing each other!" `
`"That simple, pure desire just to be around someone of the opposite sex, `
`the noble first loves." `
`"Just wonderful... `
`A bunch of kids thinking and talking about the world of love...!" `
`"D... `
`...Did that sort of thing... `
`r- `
`really happen...?" `
`"Ihihi! `
`Don't play dumb! `
`You were the most absorbed and curious of all of us, sitting there 'til even your ears turned red, ihihi!" `
`"I-I was not curious...! `
`I-I was just... `
`s- `
`surprised... `
`at how much everyone knew... `
`and..." `
`"That's right. `
`Shannon always played dumb the most, even though she was the most interested. `
`She was the biggest pervert there. Ihihihi." `
`"Th-That's not true, `
`that's not true, `
`I hate you, Milady!" `
`"Hahahahahahahahahaha... `
`Yeah, it was always like this. `
`In the day, we'd run around like kids, and at night, we'd hug our pillows and talk about secret stuff. `
`Looking back on all of it now, ...it really brings back some fond memories." `
`"We'd be whispering about something dirty, and whenever we heard the footsteps of the adults coming by, we'd jump under the covers and pretend to be sleeping!" `
`"Yeah, I remember that! `
`Like some school field trip!" `
`"Those times we all dove under the covers at once. `
`It felt like some sort of unspoken rule, like a strange sense of unity. `
`I really liked that feeling." `
`"Well, anyway, `
`that's not all we talked about. `
`There was a lot more than that. `
`We really did enjoy our youth to the fullest." `
`"And what...is this?" `
`Shannon, `
`...is this that "fun thing" of the Human world? `
`Is this incomprehensible messing around the thing that you found? `
`"A bunch of kids gathered together, playing stupid games and talking about trivial matters. `
`...Is this the Human pleasure you found that surpasses the pleasures of witches?" `
`"...Yes. `
`Doesn't it look fun to you?" `
`"I won't call it boring. `
`However, I cannot see how such a vulgar game can compare to my paradise, `
`where all wishes can be granted." `
`"Interacting with people...is a lot of fun. `
`Of course, I also think your world is fun. `
`But even so, ...I choose this world." `
`"...I don't understand. `
`...I don't understand at all..." `
`{f:5:Beatrice} held her head as though she was having a headache. `
`But no matter how much she grimaced, she couldn't think of an answer. `
`"...Tell me. `
`......What is it you found within this vulgar playing?" `
`"...... `
`Do you want to know...?" `
`"I do!" `
`"Love." `
`"Lo...ve...?" `
`"Here. `
`It's the Queen book I promised." `
`"Th-Thank you very much. `
`I'd be happy to borrow it." `
`"That's okay. You can keep it, Shannon-chan. `
`I've already read it." `
`"B-But... `
`I can't accept this... `
`It was probably expensive." `
`"It's just something I got for a few hundred yen at a bazaar. `
`Don't worry about it. `
`I'd rather if you read it quickly so we can talk about it. `
`It's fun to talk about this sort of stuff with you, Shannon-chan." `
`"Yes, `
`it's fun for me too. `
`It's much more fun to read mystery novels with two people instead of alone." `
`"I like talking about it and imagining all kinds of things. `
`With mystery novels, reading's only half the fun. `
`My theory's that you can only really enjoy it when you talk with other people who've read it too." `
`Our relationship began when we realized that we both read mystery novels. `
`We were both surprised and very interested to find that the other not only read tons of mystery novels, `
`but read them very thoroughly. `
`Ever since then, it's been like this. `
`Separate from the games we played with all the cousins, the two of us met together for some time alone... `
`At first, it was like a sort of contest to see who knew more than the other. `
`However, eventually, this turned into respect for how much the other had read and how deeply they were able to think about it. `
`Respect. `
`Trust. `
`Those emotions made our friendship even stronger. `
`Of course, all of that had still fallen within the category of "friendship"... `
`...But we were still slightly aware of the fact that the other was of the opposite sex, `
`making for a relationship that was charming, or youthful, ...or maybe you could call it exciting. `
`However, we were still at the age where calling us "young men and women" would probably be a bit too gracious. `
`Of course, we didn't know a thing about love. `
`So, we couldn't understand that exciting feeling in our chests, `
`both bitter and sweet, that we only felt when we were alone together. `
`However, we realized that there was some unknown emotion hidden behind that feeling, `
`...and as our hearts raced, `
`we had our hands upon the door. `
`That was the exciting age we were at. `
`So. `
`At some point, our discussions about mystery novels became just an excuse for us meeting alone... `
`"There aren't many mystery novels that care much about the "why dunnit"." `
`"The "why dunnit"? `
`You mean the culprit's motive...?" `
`"Yeah. `
`There are three points you need to figure out in mystery novels: the "who dunnit", the "how dunnit", and the "why dunnit". `
`A lot of mysteries deal with the first two, but surprisingly few worry about the final one." `
`"Well, I know about many works that take great care to have the culprit confess his motive after he's been found out..." `
`"But it has to be something you can reason out before the culprit confesses, or it doesn't count. `
`Personally, I think it's unfair for a person who supposedly didn't have a motive to commit the crime, `
`unless it's possible to reason his or her motive out." `
`"Who dunnit". `
`Who's the culprit? `
`"How dunnit". `
`How did he commit the crime? `
`"Why dunnit". `
`Why did he commit the crime? `
`"There are a ton of works that ask about who the culprit is, `
`and what tricks they used. `
`In fact, almost all are like that. `
`However, I don't think there are many novels that ask you to figure out the motive." `
`"Good point. `
`That might be the most neglected of the three." `
`"Mysteries that don't take the "why dunnit" seriously don't really feel complete to me. `
`...No, I'm not saying they're boring. `
`...It's more like...they're missing the most important part." `
`"The most important part...is missing...?" `
`"The heart. `
`The heart is missing." `
`"...The heart..." `
`"I think the human heart is a really important thing. `
`If a person's gonna decide to commit murder, plan it out, get everything ready, and actually carry it out, `
`you'd need an incredibly strong force of the heart. `
`The heart is what moves people." `
`...In other words, `
`only the heart can kill a person. `
`When an emotional upheaval grows strong enough to make a person want to kill, the result is the tragedy called murder. `
`If we turn it around, does that mean that the true way to close in on the crime is by searching for the heart that brings about the tragedy of murder? `
`Only the heart can kill a person. `
`So, if a person has been killed, you must search for that heart. `
`That's what he's saying. `
`"That's why `
`I can't really enjoy novels where the culprit is `
`just a homicidal maniac who kills for fun." `
`"...Then you like novels that show a strong enough movement of the heart to lead to murder?" `
`"That's right. `
`And my favorite ones are the novels that let you reason that out." `
`As he spoke, he looked back at me and smiled. `
`...Before today, I used to like novels that focused on exposing tricks. `
`However, I decided to look for novels like the ones he recommended in the future. `
`"I don't like neglecting the heart. `
`......The heart is what makes people move." `
`"...Yeah. `
`I think you're right..." `
`This isn't limited to the mystery genre. `
`All humans are moved by their hearts all the time. `
`Being able to notice the heart is what allows for interactions between people... `
`...no, interactions between hearts. `
`None of us humans can live on our own. `
`And yet, we have no way of peeking into the hearts of others. `
`That's why every meeting between people...is a mystery of the heart. `
`Finding those, reasoning about them, and understanding each other is the key to interactions between people and hearts. `
`The two of us are here, all alone, talking together about mysteries. `
`And through that... `
`We are searching out each other's hearts, speaking of the heart's mysteries... `
`I want you to feel about me... `
`...the way I feel about you. `
`We're both searching, `
`trying to figure out the depths of the other's heart... `
`in this mystery of love. `
`"Nng, ...look how late it's gotten. `
`I wonder if Aniki and the others are waiting for us." `
`"Yes, we should probably go back soon..." `
`"...Time seems to fly by when I'm talking with you, Shannon-chan." `
`He seemed to be speaking the words of my heart. `
`We were thinking the same thing, so the same words came out. `
`"I wish we could talk together like this forever... `
`I hate clocks." `
`"Same here. `
`Talking about this stuff with you is the most fun part of coming to Rokkenjima." `
`When I saw that his smiling eyes were looking right at me, ...I turned away. `
`I couldn't let him see my suddenly red face. `
`"If only I could leave this place, `
`...I'd be able to read so much more..." `
`"............" `
`The bookshop on Niijima that I go to and the bookshop he goes to in the city are on completely different scales. `
`The book exchange between the two of us had become completely one-sided, with him giving me all the books. `
`"How long do you plan to be a servant, Shannon-chan?" `
`"...I don't know." `
`"If, someday, `
`you decide to quit..." `
`"If I do...?" `
`"Come over to my place." `
`He said it almost carelessly. `
`Maybe he was a bit embarrassed, since he laughed weakly and blushed a little. `
`"And then, `
`...we won't need to worry about time running out anymore." `
`"...That's right. `
`...We could be together...as long as we wanted..." `
`The little secret dates on this island only happened a few times a year, `
`...and even when they did happen, it was only for a short, uncertain period of time. `
`It wouldn't work over the phone or with letters. `
`We can only talk about our mystery when we're standing together like this. `
`"I know that day'll come someday." `
`"...You think it will...?" `
`"Yeah. `
`I'm certain of it." `
`Certain? `
`Why is he certain...? `
`"When that day comes, `
`...I'll come for you, riding a white horse." `
`"...Wha...?" `
`After saying this, he turned away. `
`He was probably too proud to show me his blushing cheeks. `
`But even without seeing, I knew what his face looked like. `
`To come riding on a white horse... `
`...umm, isn't that... `
`Uhh, isn't that like a prince riding a white horse...? `
`So, what exactly does that mean... `
`umm... `
`ummmmm... `
`Does it mean...you're going to be my prince...? `
`...My mind was going blank, so I just couldn't reason out his mystery of love, even though it was all plain and simple... `
`"...I- `
`I wonder... `
`when that day will come..." `
`"Anytime you're ready." `
`"Huh......?!" `
`My heart skipped a beat... `
`It was so sweet, ...yet it hurt... `
`"Anytime's good for me. `
`This is your life we're talking about, Shannon-chan. `
`You should think about it carefully before you decide. `
`...And once you've made up your mind, I'll respect your decision, no matter when you make it." `
`"...O- `
`Okay..." `
`"I'll keep on waiting until that day comes." `
`"Nng, ...ah..." `
`If only I had been a bit more foolish...and courageous. `
`I could have said then and there that I was already prepared, `
`...and asked him to take me away from this island right away... `
`But I couldn't say it. `
`{n}I had to think carefully about my future, for both of our sakes... `
`My head was filled with pointless, senseless thoughts... `
`"...I- `
`I'm glad... `
`...Thank you..." `
`"Heheh..." `
`With his back still to me, he scratched his head and laughed. `
`I knew he was doing this out of embarrassment, so I could clearly tell what his expression must have been. `
`In the same way... `
`He must have realized what my face looked like. `
`We're both puzzle-solvers of love. `
`We theorize about each other's love, solving each other's mysteries... `
`"...Thanks for giving me time." `
`"You have all the time in the world." `
`"No. `
`...I'd feel bad `
`if I kept you waiting too long." `
`"Hahaha." `
`"So, I've decided. `
`...No, I should say that I will decide. `
`...I don't mean that I'll quit my job today, right now. `
`...Yes, ...one year. `
`...One year from now." `
`...If, a year after now, `
`you still feel like coming for me on a white horse... `
`And me too. `
`If I still like you a year from now... `
`I'd like to dedicate the rest of my life to you... `
`"One year from now, right here, `
`...I'd like to make my decision." `
`"...A year, huh? `
`That sounds good. `
`Spring, summer, autumn, winter. `
`...That's a good amount of time to look honestly into your heart." `
`"...S- `
`So, `
`...next year..." `
`Please, `
`...come for me, okay...? `
`"Yep." `
`He responded to my cowardly determination with a quick, strong answer... `
`"I'll be waiting for that day to come." `
`"Yes. `
`...I'll be waiting too... `
`...Make sure...you come, okay...?" `
`"Yeah." `
`"...Don't forget. `
`Come here next year, okay?" `
`"Yeah. `
`I'll come, that's for certain. `
`I'll meet you here." `
`That's for certain. `
`......I see. `
`So, `
`...this emotion that feels like sweet suffocation... `
`is love...? `
`It is an emotion I do not know. `
`One I do not have. `
`Though my magic can grant any wish. `
`Though my paradise can grant any wish. `
`That thing I cannot have, `
`...that incomprehensible emotion... `
`...that burns like fire, and yet, madly, one wants to hold it close... `
`All I know is that no matter how great a witch I might become, I cannot create this emotion. `
`It must be given by another person. `
`For the first time, I realized that I wasn't all powerful. `
`And, I knew what Shannon had discovered in the world of Humans... `
`"...This emotion, `
`...it's just too much... `
`...Once you've felt it, `
`...there's no forgetting it, is there...?" `
`...Shannon, `
`...you win. `
`Love, ...is it? `
`It may be the most important element...and the one that I lack... `
`...Shannon. `
`I'll watch... `
`...and see how your love develops. `
`So please, ...teach me more and more about this new emotion...... `
