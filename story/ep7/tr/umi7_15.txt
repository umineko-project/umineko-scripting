`"Totally!`
` Why do guys turn into total morons when they get together?!"`
`Jessica's room was filled with laughter.`
`"It was one hell of a reality check...!`
` I thought this guy was a bit cool, a bit mature.`
` And then I see him with some of the other guys in our class, talking about dirty stuff with this creepy laugh!"`
`"It's true that boys always act like little kids when they're together."`
`"Well, it's not like girls are any better!"`
`""Ahhahahahahahaha!!""`
`The fun chat between girls continued without end.`
`Tonight, Krauss and Natsuhi were out late at a meeting on Niijima.`
`Normally, Natsuhi was always watching, so Jessica would make sure to be curt with the young servants,`
` but when Natsuhi wasn't around, Jessica never did that.`
`She had invited the servants of similar age to her room, and they were chatting away noisily...`
`All of them were at the age when they wanted to know about love.`
`Jessica enjoyed talking about love all the more thanks to the rigid and constricting way she had been brought up, and she seized upon this chance...`
`"What about you, Milady? You've got charm, you're the right age...`
` Aren't there any boys you're interested in?"`
`"W‐well, I'd like to fall in love, but there really aren't any...g‐good ones around...!"`
`"I think you should be a bit more proactive when it comes to love.`
` You act relaxed now, but it won't last long!`
` Once one of your friends starts going out with someone, it'll turn your world upside down."`
`"Th‐there's no way that'll happen...`
` None of my friends are traitors...`
` I, I think."`
`"Ah, no, no, no!`
` The one thing you definitely can't count on from a girl you call your friend is that she won't fall in love before you!`
` If you met someone you liked, you'd betray your friends and go out with the guy without a second thought, wouldn't you?!"`
`"A‐ahahahahahahahahahaha......`
` Wh‐what about you, Shannon...?!`
` It's not fair if I'm the only one who has to talk!"`
`"I, umm, ......don't have anyone like that around..."`
`......Not around.`
`He's far, far away, ......and like Orihime and Hikiboshi, I don't get to see him very often.`
`In fact, ......I don't even know when I'll be able to see him again.`
`......However, I believe that he'll come for me someday.`
` ......I believe it.`
`"Don't you betray me, okay, Shannon?!`
` If we get boyfriends, we'll get them together, okay?!`
` Right? Right? We promised, right?!"`
`"Oh, you wouldn't think it, but it's girls like Shannon‐chan...`
`who are the type to beat you to the punch!`
` *giggle*giggle*!"`
`"Shannon, fess up!!`
` You aren't going out with anyone, are you?!`
` You aren't, right?!"`
`"I, I'm not. Really......"`
`"Really?!"`
`"R‐really..."`
`"We'll get boyfriends together, okay?`
` No matter what happens, okay?!`
` Cross your heart and hope to die, stick a needle in your eye!!"`
`"Y‐yes......`
` I promise......"`
`"That's the face of a liar!`
` I'm willing to bet Shannon‐chan's the first of us all!`
` I can tell.`
` It's always the quiet ones that go first...!"`
`"Shannon, how could you?!`
` Fess up, fess up!!"`
`"P‐please stop, Milady...!`
` Th‐that tickles...!`
` A‐ahahahahaha...!!"`
`......Amid cheerful laughter, another lazy Sunday afternoon passed by.`
`I worked my way out of the fight and looked up at the sky through the window.`
`......I wonder if Battler‐san is somewhere out there right now...`
`surrounded by his friends and chatting about the same topic we are.`
`I only hope that you're thinking of me...`
`...the same way that I'm thinking of you...`
`But if I beg for that, it's the same as admitting that I don't trust you.`
`.........I'll wait.`
`And when you do come for me, I'll announce then and there that I'm quitting my job.`
`I've already prepared myself for it.`
`{n}......But...you haven't come yet.`
`That isn't because you won't come, ......but because I'm not resolved enough yet, right?`
`It's because I haven't clearly envisioned a future with you, right?`
`I'll wait.`
` ......No matter how long.`
`......Until you come for me, riding a white horse...`
`I will always treasure our promise.`
`{n}The promise of our precious resolve......`
`"No, never make a promise with a guy.`
` You can't count on them!"`
`Thinking that she had read my mind, I spun around.`
`Of course, she hadn't...`
`"Well, as far as that goes,`
` I think guys and girls have different ideas of what's important."`
`"They do, they do! {i:Totally} different.`
` On the whole, girls tend to be dreamers, and guys just do stuff without thinking."`
`"I guess understanding between the sexes is pretty much impossible after all."`
`"At least, I think it's pretty hard.`
` Girls often have the bad habit of thinking they know exactly what the guy is thinking right away.`
` They search for hidden meanings behind words that guys say for no reason in particular,`
` and just get the wrong idea."`
`"Ah, yeah, I've known girls like that.`
` Girls who've taken what anyone could tell them was just some meaningless comment as a sign that the guy is totally into them.`
` Yeah, I see it all the time."`
`"It's painful to watch when a girl gets the wrong idea."`
`Ahhahahahahahahaha.`
` The pair of them laughed together.`
`......When a girl...gets the wrong idea.`
` Could that be......me...?`
`No, that can't be.`
`{n}After all, Battler‐san made a clear promise to me.`
`{n}He said he'd come for me riding a white horse.`
`......I mustn't doubt.`
`I'm sure this conversation I'm hearing is just another one of God's trials.`
`So, I won't listen.`
` I won't even think twice about it.`
`"If there's one thing I never want to be, it's one of those embarrassing girls who thinks a guy's heart is linked to hers for no reason."`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahahaha."`
`Those demonic sneers tormented me and tried to lead me astray.`
`{n}......I'm sure he'll come to the next family conference......`
`But Battler‐san didn't come to the 1982 conference either......`
`More and more things keep changing away from the way they were at the last family conference he came to.`
`Kyrie‐sama, Rudolf‐sama's new wife, now blends in perfectly here,`
` ......coming down off the boat with a familiar stride.`
`Her daughter, Ange‐sama, is growing well, and all of the family focus their attention on her.`
`Also, Maria‐sama, who was so small at the time, is already five years old.`
` She is full of energy, and old enough to enjoy playing with George‐sama.`
`Neither Jessica‐sama nor George‐sama brought up Battler‐san's absence.`
`The other relatives were the same way.`
` ......No one touches upon the subject, as though they've forgotten that Battler‐san is missing.`
`Maria‐sama was only three when she last saw Battler‐san.`
`I doubt whether she even remembers him.`
`......In just two short years...`
`All trace of your existence......has been erased from the Ushiromiya family conference.`
`That made me sad.`
` And so I said...`
`"......It looks like Battler‐sama didn't come back this year either."`
`"True.`
` ......Do you miss having him here?"`
`"Well, ......umm......"`
`"Uncle Rudolf and Auntie Kyrie don't even bring him up anymore.`
` ......It looks like Battler‐kun was much more serious than we thought."`
`"I wonder if he really will stay away forever."`
`"Looks like it was leaving the nest after all.`
` He's spread his wings and left for a new stage of life.`
` That's my assumption."`
`"......He's always been crazy and reckless.`
` Well, what more'd you expect from a guy?"`
`"Well, we know Battler‐kun.`
` I'm sure he's adapted to his new life and is enjoying himself.`
` So, there's no reason to worry."`
`Even though George‐sama said that with a smile, his words disconcerted me.`
`He's "enjoying himself", so there's "no reason to worry"...?`
` .........What is that supposed to mean......?`
`"This is Battler we're talking about, so you can bet he's forgotten all about us and is having a great time."`
`"Yeah, I'm sure that's the case.`
` And I think that's best for him.`
` Battler‐kun must have given a lot of thought to himself, his family, and his late mother, and made the independent decision to start a new life.`
` So, I hope he lives that new life with conviction.`
` Forgetting about the Ushiromiya family would do him a lot of good."`
`George‐sama smiled at me, expecting me to agree.`
`......After a moment of shock, I smoothed my expression over and found the expression he was expecting.`
`Is Battler‐san......living happily,`
` ......having forgotten about the family, about me, about our promise......?`
`That can't be true. It just can't be.`
`Battler‐san must be striving to reach that day of resolve just like me.`
`I'm not mistaken about that.`
`He promised me.`
`{n}He said he'd come riding a white horse.`
`I never asked him to say that.`
`{n}He said he'd come for me on the day I resolved to live life for his sake.`
`He made that promise himself.`
`For two years,`
` I've believed that.`
`I've done all I could to make it through God's trials and the whisperings of demons that tried to throw me from my path.`
`And yet, ......the things both George‐sama and Jessica‐sama are saying...are so cruel.`
`Battler‐san has forgotten about us and has started a new life?`
`Why are they telling such obvious lies......?`
`But that night...`
`{n}I dreamed of Battler‐san for the first time in a long while.`
`The Battler‐san in my dream.........wasn't the Battler‐san I believed in.`
`......It was the Battler‐san that George‐sama and Jessica‐sama had spoken of,`
` .........the one who had forgotten everything and started a new life.`
`Morning arrived.`
` I woke up with a tear‐stained face.`
`The me in the mirror......whimpered through tears that she couldn't wait any longer.`
`If you've managed to wait this long, why can't you wait any longer...?`
`{n}This is a trial.`
` ......We have to believe in him and wait.`
`But the me in the mirror spoke.`
` ......It was sharper than a fragment of glass.`
`.........We talk about this promise, ......but did we actually {i:make} a promise with him...?`
`Don't you remember what Jessica‐sama said?`
` ......That some girls are dreamers who get the wrong idea?`
`Don't you remember what George‐sama said?`
` ......That Battler‐san has gotten used to his new life......and has forgotten about the Ushiromiya family?`
`.........He wouldn't be the only one to forget.`
`{n}Without me asking about Battler‐san, everyone on this island would have forgotten his name.`
`{n}Even Rudolf‐sama doesn't say his name anymore.`
`If I weren't here to remember his face,`
` ......perhaps his existence would have been erased from the hearts and minds of everyone here.`
`......I don't believe it.`
` So, I won't doubt him.`
`Battler‐san must still remember our promise.`
`We're both waiting for the day of resolve, the day we'll be together.`
` ............Battler‐san.`
`{n}My mind is firmly made up.`
`Does the fact that you're not here mean that I'm {i:still} not resolved enough?`
`No.`
` ......It's because you and God are testing me, isn't it?`
`In that case, I will endure.`
`{n}Until that promised day inevitably comes.`
`.........So, ......please.`
` Battler‐san.`
`I want some sign......that you haven't forgotten me.........`
`That...was the crack that ran across my ceramic heart.`
`At last, I had to acknowledge the possibility.`
`......The possibility that something terrible and dreadfully sad was happening......and I was pretending not to notice.`
`Battler‐san...makes me yearn for him.`
`{n}Battler‐san...makes me sad.`
`{n}Battler‐san...makes it hurt.........`
`Battler‐san.`
`......Do you still remember me, now.........?`
`And then......came the third family conference since Battler‐san left.`
`If the number of beds was going to increase, we would be told about that when setting up.`
`The fact that nothing has changed in particular......means that he probably won't be here this year either.`
`Clinging to a final bit of hope, I stood by the docks, watching the boat draw closer.`
`"Hey, Shannon‐chan.`
` You're looking as pretty as ever."`
`"Careful, Ange.`
` Watch your step."`
`"Hey, Shannon. You know, I love visiting Rokkenjima...!`
` Uncle Krauss really should hurry up with his plans to turn it into a resort."`
`"Why bother?`
` It'd be such a waste."`
`"Eheheh, maybe it would.`
` How have you been, Shannon‐chan?`
` I think you've gotten a bit taller since last time."`
`"......Thank you very much."`
`"And the weather's good again this year...!`
` We should count our blessin's that we can bring the whole family together like this without a single one of us missin'."`
`"Please allow me to guide you to the mansion......"`
`So, after all, ......Battler‐san has been so thoroughly forgotten that he might as well not have existed in the first place.`
`The sadness must be showing on my face.`
`Not wanting anyone to see it, ......I turned my back to the family and led the way up to the mansion.`
`Then, ......suddenly, someone mentioned Battler‐san's name, and I jumped.`
`"What, you saw Battler‐kun?"`
`"Is he doing well...?!"`
`"Yes,`
` he's doing very well.`
` I took Ange and had some tea with him the other day."`
`I was surprised.`
` ......So, Kyrie‐sama was in touch with Battler‐san.`
`According to her, the fight between Battler‐san and Rudolf‐sama had calmed down a long time ago,`
` but both were so stubborn that they hadn't found a good chance to make up.`
`And since Battler‐san had gotten used to living with his grandparents and going to school near there,`
` it wasn't going to be easy to get him to come back home, especially considering that the grandparents were adding extra complications.`
`"......It's just too bad.`
` I think Asumu‐san's parents were even more angry than Battler‐kun was.`
` This isn't just an issue between Battler‐kun and Rudolf‐san anymore."`
`"Then will Battler be coming back sometime soon?"`
`"He will make up with Rudolf‐san, but it looks like he doesn't intend to return to the Ushiromiya family.`
` ......Such a shame.`
` Though I do understand how he feels."`
`It was a bit of a relief to hear that some of the bad feeling had died down in these three years.`
`Taking Asumu‐sama's parents into account, it's no surprise that things haven't gone as well as they could.`
`But if Battler‐san doesn't hate Rudolf‐sama anymore, ......then someday...`
`......Surely he'll come back.`
` He'll have grown so much.`
`My resolve will never waver again.`
`For some nights these past three years, I've felt sad and resentful.`
`But now, ......it feels as though those three years were something I needed.`
`After all, ......the seeds of love, the faint feelings I once had for you...`
`...have budded powerfully, waiting for the day that we'll be reunited.`
`This is how honest my feelings for you are now.`
`.........I...love you.`
`I want to see you again as soon as I can.`
`Until that time, ......I'll keep this sprout of love warm and growing for you......`
`I won't doubt the coming of that day anymore.`
`Just as I think of you, under the same sky...`
`...I believe that you are thinking of me.`
`......I'm sure this news about him is a sign that God is cheering me on.`
`So, I asked God one more time, inside my heart.`
`Since my feelings for Battler‐san have not wavered for a day these past three years...`
`Let me know that he feels the same way.`
`I know that asking for that is a sin.`
`However, now that we've reached a three‐year turning point,`
` ......I want some gift from God, any gift, to show that I have not waited in vain.`
`That is what I prayed.`
`"Oh, that's right.`
` It's been so long since Battler‐kun last saw you all, right?`
` I thought you might be feeling lonely, so I told him to write you letters.`
` Here they are."`
`..................Huh...?`
`Did God......really hear my prayers?`
`{n}I felt as though my heart was going to leap out of my chest.`
`"A letter from Battler?`
` Awesome!`
` What'd he write?!"`
`"Did he say anything about how he's been doing lately?`
` I can't wait to read it."`
`Kyrie‐sama pulled a brown envelope out of her bag and handed it to George‐sama.`
`Just one?`
`When George‐sama opened it, several folded letters came out.`
`"Looks like this one's addressed to me.`
` ......They all have different names on them.`
` Here, this one's yours, Jessica‐chan."`
`"Thanks!"`
`"And this one's for Maria‐chan.`
` Will she be able to read it...?"`
`"I'll read it to her later.`
` Thank you."`
`"There's even one for Ange‐chan.`
` Now of course she can't read."`
`"*giggle*.`
` I'll give it to her when she does learn."`
`"He says he's doing great and having a blast...!`
` That's awesome."`
`"......Umm,`
` ......is that...`
`all of them...?"`
`"Yep.`
` Looks like that's all of them.`
` Thanks a lot."`
`George‐sama handed me the empty envelope.`
`......Apparently, he thanked me because he thought I was offering to throw it away for him.`
`And, clearly, ......there was nothing inside it.`
`There was no letter for me...`
`"Whoa.`
` The more I read, the more fun it looks like Battler‐kun's been having.`
` Living every day to the fullest."`
`"That's what it looks like in mine, too.`
` If he's happy, then I guess that's what counts."`
`"*giggle*.`
` That's so mean of Battler‐kun.`
` It sounds like he forgot about us until you told him to write those letters."`
`"Well, you know what he's like.`
` Battler‐kun enjoys life.`
` And I hear he's popular with the ladies at school, too."`
`"Wow...!`
` Incredible!"`
`"There should be plenty of girls who like those hilarious, melodramatic lines of his.`
` Makes sense to me."`
`"I wonder if he really does plan to stay away."`
`"It looks like he does.`
` In my letter, it says that he doesn't plan to return to Rokkenjima."`
`I know that all these letters and the things written inside them...`
`...are trials from God.`
`The absence of a letter for me,`
` the information that he's enjoying life and has forgotten about Rokkenjima,`
` ......are all just trials upon trials.`
`He is...`
` God is...`
`...testing me.`
`The fact that I'm the only one without a letter is proof of that......`
` ............I...`
`............wanted to believe that............`
`......But...`
`......at last.........`
`I couldn't believe any longer...............`
`"......It might've been an important promise to you,`
` ......but it looks like it wasn't for Battler."`
`"................................."`
`"......No way.`
` ......Then, that promise about him coming on a white horse was..."`
`"I was a dreamer... It was just an illusion I created......"`
`"To Battler, they were probably just meaningless words to make him sound cool."`
`......What a ludicrous story it might seem to an outside observer.`
`{n}That promise with Battler might have been an illusion the whole time.`
`We don't even know......if they felt the same way about each other in the first place.`
`Love is an illusion.`
`When both sides see the same illusion, the love becomes true.`
`However, when the feelings of each side are different, ......then it's nothing more than a joke.`
`"This is Battler's sin."`
`"......That he created the illusion......of a promise."`
`"No."`
`".........Huh?"`
`"......It's that he didn't even remember."`
`"If he had simply broken his promise, ......I could have confronted him about it.`
` I could have regretted, or I could have recovered.`
` .........However, since he didn't even remember, I am unable to question him about it."`
`".............................."`
`"I am unable to hate Battler‐san.`
` ......After all, Battler‐san didn't even break his promise."`
`"There just wasn't......any promise from the beginning."`
`"......It was nothing more than a sad.........joke."`
`.........I kept on crying and crying.`
`{n}I dug my fingernails into my pillow, soaking it with my tears.`
`How much easier it would be to hate something...`
`But I can't hate anything.`
`I just couldn't get over my miserable arrogance,`
` ......which had led me to believe for three whole years that he felt the same as I did.`
`"......I am to blame for this.`
` ......My irresponsible words led you to believe that Battler made a promise..."`
`"No.........`
` This isn't anyone's fault.`
` ......It's all because I assumed that he felt the same way I did..."`
`"Battler did not make a promise.`
` However, that does not mean his feelings were anything to be laughed at!`
` Though there might have been a difference in degree when compared to yours,`
` it is true that he liked you!`
` Of that, there can be no doubt."`
`"......Please, ......just stop it......`
` ......I've believed that he liked me the way I liked him, ......without ever doubting that.`
` .........Please don't try to cheer me up.`
` ......I'd rather......that you mocked me........."`
`Before I knew it......`
`a dull inescapable pain had pierced my chest.`
`{n}When I pressed my hand against my chest, I realized what that pain was.`
`It was the bud of love, which I had sown the seeds of and raised in my heart.`
`Its roots had spread throughout my chest,`
` ......tormenting me like a metal wire wrapped around my heart.`
`Rather than roots, ......they looked more like fissures running through my heart.`
`The only way to kill the pain would be to tear out the roots of love.`
`But no matter how much I clawed at them, it was only my heart that got torn and scratched.`
` ......The roots of love didn't move at all.`
`If my feelings for Battler‐san were to turn to hate, without any lingering interest or regrets,`
` ...I'd be able to pull out these roots easily.`
`They would probably leave a hole behind, but at least they wouldn't hurt me anymore.`
`But they won't come out.`
` ......Even though it hurts so much, those roots of love are still stuck in my heart.`
`"......Shannon..............."`
`"I...`
` .........Even now,`
` ......I love Battler‐san...`
`......so much.`
` ......I miss him.`
` I want him to come back......`
` I believe he will come back someday,`
` ......and I want to wait for him...`
` ......But...`
`...now it's just...`
`...too much........."`
`As I sobbed, the tightness in my chest grew even stronger.`
`As long as I love Battler‐san, that pain will always continue.`
`Because I love him, I want to hold onto that pain forever.`
`But......it was written right there in the letters for George‐sama and the others.`
`Battler doesn't plan on returning to the Ushiromiya family.`
`He's forgotten about me and Rokkenjima,`
` ......and has started a new life with a different name.`
`I have to endure all this aching, biting, agonizing pain...`
`......and wait forever for someone who will never return...`
`"Is this another trial......?`
` To wait for him forever?`
` ......Is that what God is asking of me......?`
` I can't do that......`
` I...`
`...want to be with Battler‐san.`
` But if this is the trial...`
`that I must go through for that...`
`...it's just...`
`......too painful......"`
`"...................................."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} hung her head in shame.`
`If she hadn't encouraged Shannon so much, it probably wouldn't have been this painful.`
`Shannon may have been the one to sow the seed of love in her heart.`
`{n}However, {f:5:Beatrice} had irresponsibly watered it and told Shannon not to give up.`
`......{f:5:Beatrice} scratched at her chest, trying to share Shannon's pain...`
`"........................This is...my fault."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} mumbled to herself.`
`"......How can any of this be your fault?"`
`"For three years, I tortured you with the illusion of a promise that never happened.`
` ......If I had not nourished the bud of love within you, ......you would not have suffered so."`
`"................................."`
`"Shannon.`
` This may sound harsh, ......but listen."`
`"...............What is it...?"`
`"Forget Battler.`
` ......There was no bud of love in the first place."`
`"......No.`
` I'm the one who nourished it.`
` ......No matter how painful it is, I can't forget it."`
`"But you cannot bear that pain any longer, can you......?"`
`"......................................."`
`Wordlessly, Shannon held her chest and hung her head.`
`I......yearn for Battler.`
`Even now, that feeling burns inside me,`
` ......and no matter how much it hurts, I can't let it go.`
`I've spent three years pretending not to notice that pain.`
`Now, I know that I feel it.`
`And now that I know, ......it's unbearable...`
`"So, you cannot throw away your bud of love for Battler?"`
`"..................I can't."`
`"However, at this rate,`
` ......the bud...the roots...will kill you."`
`".............................."`
`"People need a universe to survive.`
` ......And one person cannot create that universe alone.`
` Two are needed."`
`".........A universe......"`
`"Together with Battler, you created the universe of that bud of love.`
` ......Now that one half of that pair is gone, your universe has crumbled.`
` ......People cannot......complete a universe on their own."`
`"But...`
`...the other person who creates my universe,`
` ......Battler‐san, won't come back..."`
`"Then you must create a new universe with someone else."`
`".........You mean, ......create one with someone other than Battler‐san?"`
`"I will give you that someone."`
`"......Who are you.........talking about......?"`
`"A creature to bury the pain in your heart and heal you.`
` ......He will not betray you.`
` ......Yes, ......let it be a sibling.`
` ............I will give you a little brother."`
`"A little brother..............."`
`"A boy you have always been close to at the Gospel House, whom you love as if he were your real brother.`
` ......That, I shall give to you.`
` ......Together with him, you will create a new universe."`
`"......Will that little brother......make me forget about the pain of my love for Battler‐san......?"`
`"Indeed.`
` .........You need a universe."`
`"Then, ......what will happen to the bud of love...`
`...in my heart?`
` .........My feelings for Battler‐san won't change.`
` ......I can't make them wither."`
`"..............................`
` ......I shall accept that bud and those roots...`
`in your place."`
`"......You will............?"`
`"You can forget the pain of love and create a new universe.`
` ......I will accept the bud of love in your place.`
` ......It means that I will accept the pain as well, ......but I will also learn of the single element I do not possess,`
` ......the element of love."`
`{f:5:Beatrice}......wanted to know love.`
`{n}She wanted to feel what Shannon had felt in the world of humans.`
`".........And,`
` if Battler ever does return,`
` if the bud still has not withered and you still desire it,`
` I shall return it to you.`
` ......What do you think of that?"`
`"...................................."`
`Still hanging her head, ......Shannon gave a small nod, but said nothing.`
`It would mean release from this unbearable pain.`
`And...it would mean giving the bud of love to the witch, to hold in her place......`
`Shannon spread the hands that she had held to her chest.`
`As she did, a faint light slipped out of her chest and floated in the air,`
` ......gradually swallowing everything with its brightness.`
`As the brilliant light began to fade away, Shannon and {f:5:Beatrice}, still facing each other,`
` were now inside a vast, starry sphere, like a planetarium.`
`They were the only ones in this pitch‐black starry sea.`
`.........Shannon felt as though she had seen this place once before, but she could not remember.`
`Then, I made another announcement.`
`"The world shall be modified.`
` ......Let the bud of love travel from Shannon to {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`This way, Shannon won't be tormented by the bud of love anymore.`
`On top of this, so that Shannon can create a new universe, ......I'll give her a little brother.`
`The backstory for the little brother will be a younger boy at the Gospel House with whom Shannon was close.`
`For a name, ...............let there be the {ruby:on:{p:0:音}} character, as Gospel House rules state.`
`............Yeah, I've decided.`
`{n}......That's a perfect name to go with Shannon's.`
`He'll be......a quiet, reticent boy.`
`{n}He'll come to Rokkenjima as a new servant.`
`There, he'll establish an immediate rapport with Shannon.`
`As a duty‐minded boy who loves Shannon like a big sister, he'll always be there for her......`
`Let's have him be a special servant like Genji, who is permitted to serve Kinzo directly.`
` ......Yeah.`
` That sounds kinda cool.`
`Then, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}From now on, you will carry the bud of love.`
`In other words, ......the role of being infatuated with Battler and waiting for his return will go to you.`
`While you are still the witch who reigns over Rokkenjima's night...`
`{n}You have also been waiting for Ushiromiya Battler, ever since that day three years ago.`
`Along with this change in setting, I'll give you a new form as well...`
`He did tell us what his ideal woman would look like once, remember?`
`......A woman with a great figure and long, golden hair, like a foreign model.`
` Golden hair.`
` Long hair.`
` A great figure.`
`......Yeah.`
` Something like that.`
`{n}That's what the new {f:5:Beatrice} will look like.`
`Come now, hold that bud of love in your heart as you wait for Battler.`
`......You will learn of love at last...and pay the price of pain.`
`Yes, this will be the setting for my new world.`
`For Shannon, a new servant like a little brother will come.`
`{n}He will be a silent, reticent boy.`
` A duty‐minded kid who loves Shannon as a sister.`
`And the bud of love that has tortured Shannon......will go to the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`She will just be holding onto the bud of love for the time being.`
`However, while she holds onto it, she will be a maiden in love with Battler.`
`For that time, you will be able to learn what love is......`
`Come, let the world be modified.`
`{n}Oh, I am one yet many.`
`Awaken, us.`
`And stretch your wings in this new world......`
`.........Slowly, .........I opened my eyes to the gentle rays of the morning sun.`
`..............................`
`How long has it been since I woke to such a pleasant morning?`
`......The face in my mirror is tear‐stained and pathetic.`
`However, ......my heart is as clear as the morning sun.`
`I could still clearly remember that strange dream.`
`{n}However, I could feel myself forgetting it rapidly...`
`The place I'd been in my dreams......had been such a strange place.`
`A peaceful, calm place.`
`......There, ......I had left behind the pain I had carried in my chest until yesterday.`
`So this morning, my heart was at peace...`
`"Good morning, me........."`
`My tear‐stained face really looked pathetic.`
`{n}However, my expression was bright and cheery.`
`I still do...`
`...love...`
`Battler‐san.`
`But, ......I think I'd say...`
`......I've calmed down.`
`It feels like I've put something precious safely away in the place it belongs.`
`............Battler‐san.`
` When will you come back, I wonder...`
`{n}When you do, I'd like to talk about mystery novels again.`
`......Oh, I almost forgot.`
`{n}A new boy servant will be coming today, won't he?`
`One of the rare servants who will serve the Master directly.`
`{n}What kind of kid will he be?`
` I hope we get along well......`
`What was his name again?`
`{n}I think......it was......`
