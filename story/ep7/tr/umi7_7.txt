`"So...heheh...about earlier,`
` sorry you had to see me acting like that... I blame the {i:future heir}......"`
`"It's not going to leave a mark, is it?`
` Talk about merciless."`
`".........Did you say something, Jessica?"`
`"O‐of course not...!`
` I've already, uh, learned my lesson, okay?!"`
`Lion, who had apparently been chatting with the adult siblings, spun around with a smile and stared at Jessica.`
` ......Looks like the older sibling's firmly in control around here.`
`"......Those are some sharp ears.`
` I think I finally get this Lion person."`
`"Yeah, yeah, yeah!`
` The future heir's always been annoyingly sharp!`
` Not to mention the favorite of all the adults!`
` I'm always compared against this kid, at home and at school!"`
`"Come to think of it, Lion was the student council president for both middle school and high school.`
` And the head of the badminton team too."`
`"So everywhere you go, you get compared to Lion, and it doesn't work out too well for you."`
`"I said it as soon as I got into middle school.`
` The future heir was already the vice‐president of the student council.`
` I said "if you're planning to become council president next year, that'll just put more pressure on me, so stop it!""`
`"But the next year rolls around, and guess who signs up as a candidate and wins in a landslide?!`
` Same thing happened when I started high school!`
` I said "please, just give it a rest this time", but by that point, the future heir was {i:already} the vice‐president!`
` Then, senior year? Immediately president of the student council!"`
`"Dad was oh so proud!`
` Mom kept saying "now you make sure you do your best as the little sister", over and over and over again!!`
` Nngyaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}ahhhh!"`
`"But even so, you're still proud to be Lion's little sister, aren't you?"`
`"I‐i‐it's not like I ever thought about that!`
` Nope, never! Not even once...!"`
`"It can be tough to be compared against perfection.`
` Still, other people are other people, and you are you.`
` There's no need to feel dwarfed.`
` You should live the way you want to with all you've got."`
`"Of course!`
` But Mom and the others are always going on about how I need to follow in the footsteps of Ushiromiya Lion as the younger sibling.`
` ......They keep telling me to go join the student council, go play badminton......"`
`"Don't you play in a band?"`
`"Wh‐......wha?!`
` Sh‐shhhhhhh!`
` That's a secret! No one knows...!"`
`Apparently, she's keeping it a secret from her family.`
`Interesting.`
` ......People often like to blame their family for what they've grown up to be like,`
` but even in a different world with a different family, the interests of the girl called Jessica are the same as ever.`
`It's admirable that she has such a true and constant interest in something.`
`"I love that kind of stuff.`
` "Pettan, pettan".`
` "Sweets, sweets"."`
`"Wah, wah, wah!!`
` Shh, shh, shh!!"`
`Nothing wrong with the extraordinarily accomplished sort, like Lion, but kids who act their age do have their charms.`
`"That's the best way to go through life.`
` Enjoy your youth to the fullest."`
`"W‐well, uh......thanks."`
`Apparently, no one had ever told Jessica that they approved of how she lived,`
` and the direct way Will had put it made her turn red and hang her head in embarrassment.`
`"I want to ask you two now."`
`"The same thing you just asked Maria‐chan?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Please tell me everything you know about {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......Well, you can see how much Maria‐chan likes witches and the occult.`
` For her, {f:5:Beatrice} is a symbol to be admired, like an anime heroine.`
` She believes every little thing is some sort of prank caused by a witch's magic."`
`"You are an adult.`
` And the fact that you never say this to Maria is also very adult of you."`
`"Of course.`
` Childhood dreams only happen when you're a kid.`
` I think respecting that precious experience is an adult's responsibility."`
`"Looks like the two of us will get along well."`
`George's position was that {f:5:Beatrice} was nothing more than a fairy tale.`
`However, that phrase—“respecting a child's dreams is the adult thing to do”—that might be worthy of further scrutiny.`
`When she got a candy from {f:5:Beatrice} by magic, Maria probably got excited and told George and the others.`
`Then, the adults followed his lead and positively went along with her story "as adults should".`
`However, there could be other ways this sort of reaction could occur, other than as an adult's response to a child's claims.`
`For example, it could be an inferior's response to the claims of their superior.`
`......If Kinzo, tyrant of the Ushiromiya family, claimed that {f:5:Beatrice} existed and had revived,`
` perhaps the other members of the family would positively go along with his story "as his inferiors should".`
`Though {f:5:Beatrice} only appeared directly in front of a limited number of people,`
`......it's probably safe to say that the concept of her existence penetrated deeply within the Ushiromiya family, even among those who had never seen her.`
`However, no matter how deeply that concept penetrated, she was only viewed as a sort of fairy tale character.`
`It would be necessary to transform the concept of that character from an imaginary fairy tale into reality.`
`So, a person attempting to do this would need to perform something that could only conceivably be done by magic.`
`And that something......was the series of witch incidents that started with the nighttime window‐opening pranks played by Beato the Elder...`
`...and ultimately escalated to locked‐room murders.`
`......Beato the Elder referred to this, saying that the anti‐magic power filling the mansion would be weakened bit by bit the more she made her existence known.`
`{f:5:Beatrice}.`
`Why did you desire so greatly to make all others accept your existence?`
`Because the imaginary becomes the truth if everyone accepts it?`
`Because at that moment, the being called {f:5:Beatrice} will be acknowledged and will become {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}?`
`In that case, before {f:5:Beatrice} is acknowledged by all people, she's less than {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` She's furniture.`
`Why would furniture want to become {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}?`
`It feels like this was the theme of the previous game.`
`Because they want to gain the right.`
`Furniture cannot ____.`
`{n}So, they try to become {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} for the right to ____.`
`...........................`
`It really is quite simple.`
`......It's directly connected to the reason the chick Beato was born in the first place.`
`".....................`
` ......I see.`
` ......I do understand, but it's complicated."`
`I can't......ignore the heart.`
`"I feel bad for saying this at {f:5:Beatrice}'s funeral,`
` ......but, truth be told, I don't know enough about {f:5:Beatrice} to explain her.`
` My apologies."`
`"As far as that goes, Jessica‐chan does live here, so she might know a little more than I do.`
` ......Speaking of which, have you introduced yourself to this gentleman yet, Jessica‐chan?"`
`"Nah, not yet.`
` ......There's this idiot going around pinching people's butts, so I didn't really have the chance yet...ehehe..."`
`A bit late, Jessica looked embarrassed for acting rudely in front of an unfamiliar guest.`
`She cleared her throat and made a beautiful bow that didn't fit well with her normal attitude.`
` She even lifted the corners of her skirt in a curtsy.`
`"P‐pleased to meet you.`
` ......My name is Jessica.`
` Allow me to welcome you to the Ushiromiya family on this splendid day......`
`umm, I mean, please enjoy our hospitality...and......."`
`"......Willard.`
` Call me Will."`
`"Huh?`
` .........Huh?`
` ...............Wah—"`
`Jessica's greeting had been of the old‐fashioned sort,`
` so Will also treated her like an old‐fashioned lady.`
` He bent down on one knee, took Jessica's right hand, and kissed the back of it.`
`"Wah, wah......waah........."`
`Not expecting her greeting to be returned in such an old‐fashioned and formal way, Jessica turned red and was unable to speak.`
`......However, Will had returned the greeting in what he thought was a perfectly serious way,`
` so he didn't understand what was making Jessica's face glow.`
`"Have I done something strange?"`
`"No, no, I just didn't...ah, ahahaha..."`
`"I want to hear what you know about {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...............nn."`
`A glow leaked from Will's right hand, which was grasping Jessica's.`
`Looks like the theatergoing power is having its effect on Jessica.`
`......Didn't mean for that to happen.`
` Oh well...`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}, is it...?`
` W‐well, I can tell you, .........but will you promise me something?`
` Promise you won't laugh.`
` Thinking about it now, ......it sounds more than a little crazy."`
`"What is it you know?`
` I won't laugh.`
` Tell me."`
`"S‐sure...`
` .........Umm, where should I start......."`
`To me, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} is...`
`...sort of like one of the "seven mysteries" of the Ushiromiya family.`
`You've heard of those, right? Almost all schools have a set of tall tales or ghost stories that get passed down.`
`Like "on some days, the piano in the music room will start playing by itself", or "the skeleton in the science room dances around at night".`
`Everyone's heard of them.`
` But of course, that doesn't mean they believe in them.`
`The stories about {f:5:Beatrice} were the same.`
`It was just one of those strange tales about our way‐too‐big mansion.`
`The servants would sometimes talk about seeing things or whatever during their night patrols.`
`Sometimes, I felt a bit annoyed about them turning my home into a place for ghost stories, but I didn't pay it any more attention than that.`
` That's how little it mattered to me.`
`So, during my normal, everyday life, I would completely forget about the name "{f:5:Beatrice}".`
`Of course, when that huge portrait was first hung, I was definitely creeped out.`
`Even I tried not to meet her eyes after dark,`
` so yeah, I don't blame the servants for finding it eerie.`
`But that only lasted for a short while.`
`{n}I mean, I walked by that portrait every day.`
`I gradually got used to it, and eventually bored of it.`
`It was just a portrait that Grandfather blew a bunch of money on, showing the mistress from his delusions... I was past caring.`
`"I get that.`
` I'll bet it was different for the other relatives, who only came a few times a year."`
`"Exactly.`
` That's why every time the family came for a family conference, they'd always stand in front of that portrait and talk about {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` So, I was reminded of it every year."`
`"Uu, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` I've come to play again...!`
` I've drawn another new spell.`
` Take a look at it later, okay?! Uu!"`
`"You really do like {f:5:Beatrice}, don't you?`
` You've been in such high spirits ever since Grandfather had this portrait hung."`
`"Huh?`
` Where's Ange?"`
`"She went back with Aunt Kyrie to take some medicine."`
`"Ange gets sick so easy.`
` ......Totally the opposite of Battler."`
`"She's the sort that gets sick whenever she's stressed.`
` I also used to get sick on big holidays or days when we were going to the movies."`
`"Maria's really tough by comparison.`
` ......She's been talking about {f:5:Beatrice} non‐stop since we left Niijima.`
` ......Don't you think she's taking this a bit too far?"`
`"It's not so bad, right?`
` It's normal for kids to have an active imagination.`
` If a kid told you that she'd met Santa Claus,`
` would you tell her she's a liar?"`
`"......Well, of course I wouldn't go that far."`
`Maria kept talking to the portrait as though it was an old friend.`
`She promised to play with it later, as if she was talking to a living human.`
`George, a man, seemed to think that this behavior from a younger member of the opposite sex was cute.`
`......But, to be perfectly frank...`
`...Jessica, who was the same sex as Maria,`
` found this behavior a bit unpleasant regardless of Maria's age.`
`At one time, even I was fascinated by anime heroines and other fictional characters.`
`However, ......Maria's behavior seems to signify something more direct than mere fascination.`
` ......It's something much more definite,`
` ......more vivid.`
`Am I the only one who notices something odd about her?`
`......I'll bet the others all notice too, but try to ignore it because of that adult dignity George nii‐san is always talking about.`
`"......My apologies, everyone.`
` The head is quite busy with his noble research.`
` He wishes to eat lunch in his study today."`
`Until a second ago, Kinzo's children were complaining that eating lunch with their father would give them indigestion.`
`But now that they knew he wasn't coming, they started grumbling about how he should at least spare the time to come down during the annual family conferences.`
`"Then let us begin lunch, everyone.`
` I, Gohda, have made use of all my talent and experience to make sure that all of you,`
` who have come from so far away, will be entirely satisfied with your meal..."`
`No one's stomach would fail to rumble after hearing that from the great Chef Gohda.`
`By the time the splendid dishes were laid out, everyone had stopped talking about Kinzo's absence...`
`It was now Ange's absence that was being discussed.`
`Apparently, her stomachache had gotten so bad that neither she nor Kyrie could make it to lunch.`
`"Poor thing.`
` ......Gohda.`
` Make sure you talk to Kyrie‐san later and have some porridge made."`
`"Thanks a bunch for the concern.`
` ......Really sorry about this.`
` Seems she just can't handle much stress."`
`"That's how it is when they're young.`
` They're cute, at least when they're not regurgitatin'."`
`"George used to do that all the time.`
` He really was frail, way back then.`
` Right?"`
`"Let's not talk about the past...`
` It's not exactly a mealtime topic."`
`"Uu.`
` Poor Ange.`
` She doesn't get to eat this yummy food?"`
`"Yeah, poor girl.`
` Let's make sure we play with her a lot when she gets better."`
`"Uu, can't.`
` She can't play with me."`
`"Wh‐what are you talking about?`
` Why?"`
`"Because I'm gonna play with {f:5:Beatrice}, of course.`
` So I can't play with Ange."`
`"Play with {f:5:Beatrice}...`
` ......You mean you're gonna go off on your own again to mumble to yourself and read some book?"`
`Jessica slightly regretted that she hadn't been more tactful.`
`However, she couldn't wipe away that uncomfortable feeling she got every time Maria talked about {f:5:Beatrice},`
` and that feeling slipped out through her words...`
`"Uu!!`
` I don't do it on my own!`
` Beato is there too!!"`
`Maria may have been young, but she already knew how to read a person's tone.`
`She immediately burst out in anger, drawing the attention of everyone in the room...`
`Normally, Rosa would have stopped her at this point.`
`However, Rosa happened to have gone to the bathroom.`
` So, there was no one to calm Maria down...`
`"Kihihihihi!!`
` Poor Jessica, you're just a clump of the toxin!`
` With Beato's weak magical power now, she'd burn to a crisp if she ever appeared in front of you!`
` But she will appear before you eventually.`
` Yes, in front of everyone else too!!"`
`"Kihihihi, and then the door to the Golden Land will open!!`
` But who knows if you'll be invited in?`
` Of course, she will take me there, to the Golden Land!`
` But not Jessica, not Jessica!!`
` Not someone who makes fun of {f:5:Beatrice}, not an unenlightened, stupid, confused, filthy, toxin‐stained {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}!!`
` Kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hhi!!"`
`".........When someone makes fun of {f:5:Beatrice}, it's like Maria becomes a totally different person."`
`"There was a theory about Maria having multiple personalities, wasn't there?"`
`"Multiple personalities!`
` Yeah, that probably describes it perfectly.`
` Maybe that was Maria's idea of her ideal personality."`
`"You mean that thing about "creating another self", the way you want to be...?"`
`"Huh? ...How'd you know my motto?"`
`"Don't think too hard on it.`
` You'll just get a headache."`
`That was something Jessica had once told Kanon.`
`She had been talking about how anyone can create another self that they can really grow to like.`
`......I think we heard those words somewhere near the beginning of the second game.`
`Now that I think about it, some very interesting topics have been talked about since very early on...`
`"Everyone has something they really want to become.`
` But they never do it.`
` ......The restrictions on their everyday life are what made them who they are today,`
` so they have no way of changing themselves."`
`"True.`
` Changing yourself means changing your environment.`
` ......That's not easy to do."`
`"So, my idea was to leave "who I am now" unchanged...`
`...and create another "self" to be the person I want to be."`
`"You felt suffocated, forced to live the life of a rich family's daughter,`
` and you thought up a "self" that you wanted to be."`
`"But I couldn't do anything outlandish at home, of course.`
` Nothing fun about having Mom yell at me all the time.`
` ......So, I made my plan.`
` At home, I would obediently do as my parents said,`
` ......but I would also create a second "self" to do what I wanted."`
`"At home, you do everything your parents tell you, and outside, you do what you want.`
` That's a good way to live.`
` You should be proud."`
`"Heheh, thanks...`
` And, well, ......if there's something you really want to be, and you really work for it, it's easier to do than you'd think.`
` I figured Maria was pretty much the same."`
`"You think Maria's doing the same thing when she gets excited and starts talking and talking?"`
`"That's the person Maria really wants to be,`
` is how I think about it sometimes."`
`"......As the youngest member of the family, she is adored, but not respected."`
`"Every time she learns something, there's always someone in the family who already knows it.`
` She doesn't get to show off her knowledge about anything.`
` ......Whenever she does learn something new, we try to smile and praise her,`
` ......but that might actually have hurt her."`
`"So, Maria wanted to become an authority on something?"`
`It's something that all young boys and girls, who want to shake off their childhood, think.`
`It's not a bad feeling when you learn something new and your parents praise you.`
` ......But when you realize that your parents already knew that thing, it sometimes feels like they're talking down to you.`
`When a kid learns their one‐digit times table, their parents will probably praise them.`
`However, inconsiderate parents will sometimes ask mean questions, like "then what is 11 times 11?"`
` or "what is 16 times 16?"`
` or something similar.`
`If that happens, the kid will lose his feeling of accomplishment and start to feel as though he could never surpass his parents...`
`"So, it's easy to guess why Maria got interested in the occult, something no one else knew about,`
` and started learning more and more about it.`
` ......I think the person Maria wants to be...`
`is an authority on the occult who is respected by everyone."`
`"And if she talked about the occult all the time during her everyday life, Rosa'd smack her.`
` ......So, like you, she's been hiding this other "self" most of the time."`
`"That's what I think she's doing at times like this.`
` ......Maybe I should say that this is her real self slipping through the cracks to cover up her normal self."`
`"Actually, I've had some experience with that myself.`
` ......I used to admire the image of a delicate, sheltered lady and wanted to seem more frail......so I'd pretend to cough a lot, and it sort of became a bad habit."`
`"Because everyone would be nice to you if you started having coughing fits?"`
`"Haha, no...... Whenever the conversation turned to something I didn't like, or something that made me feel uncomfortable, I could do that to change the subject."`
`"I see.`
` And that's another "self" you wanted to become."`
`"Haha, I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone about that."`
`Then, ......just what is...`
`...the "other self" in Maria's case?`
`An authority on the occult who can out‐argue even adults?`
`{n}Or else, ......someone who converses and mingles with witches?`
`......Either way, denying {f:5:Beatrice} in front of Maria is clearly taboo.`
`.........In her search for something more than her everyday life,`
` Maria had found it in {f:5:Beatrice} and inside herself.`
`Then, is going to the Golden Land with {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`...Maria's...wish?`
`....................................`
`"Looks like we've gone off track.`
` Anyway, Maria kept up that tantrum until Auntie Rosa got back.`
` ......It was my fault too, arguing back when I should've let her be."`
`"And you said there was no way {f:5:Beatrice} could exist?"`
`"Something like that.`
` "If she exists, then just let me see her".`
` ......Of course, once Maria started crying, I realized I'd gone too far."`
`"And then?"`
`"At the end of the family conference, I was the only one still upset.`
` ......Maria acted as though nothing had happened.`
` Instead, she went off somewhere on her own, and came back talking happily about how she had played with {f:5:Beatrice} again."`
`"Everyone, me included, decided not to contradict her.`
` By that time, it was best to just accept it and ignore it."`
`"Is that all you have to say about the family conference?"`
`"About the conference, yes.`
` What I wanted to talk about was what happened after the conference was over and everyone left."`
`Even after the conference ended, I still felt a bit uncomfortable.`
`If Maria had just stayed mad,`
` we'd have made up with each other and I could've put it all behind me.`
`But since Maria got over it, it felt like I was the only one unsatisfied...`
`"Oh, Milady.`
` Why the gloomy face?"`
`"......Oh, it's you.`
` It's nothing important.`
` ......Did everyone make it back okay?"`
`"If they're still on schedule, they should have reached the Niijima airport by now.`
` ......You've done your part well, Milady."`
`"I haven't done anything.`
` It's you servants who've done a great job."`
`".....................`
` Is the argument you had with Maria‐sama yesterday still playing on your mind?"`
`"Nn, .........sorta."`
`"Come now, she's just a child.`
` It's not something you need to worry about, all grown up and in high school."`
`"That stuff Maria was talking about, do you think it's all just a kid's nonsense?"`
`"......About {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama,`
` ......you mean?"`
`"See, even you call her {i:sama}."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} is the name of Grandfather's mistress, the person he's still infatuated with.`
` ......I realize that, as a servant, Kumasawa‐san can't speak of her indiscreetly.`
`Still, ......that's now become the name of the fictitious witch who lives in the mansion,`
` .........and it's almost normal for people to call her "sama".`
`"{f:5:Beatrice} is just a ghost story created by the adults to stop us from wandering into the forest.`
` ......Maria just thought it was interesting one day and decided to pretend it was true."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` You'll end up cursed if you say such things.`
` After all, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama "exists"."`
`"Come on, we both know that isn't true.`
` I don't need George nii‐san to tell me not to make a fuss about Santa not existing.`
` But that doesn't mean Santa actually exists."`
`"......You'll find you're wrong there, Milady."`
`"Wrong...?"`
`"Oh yes.`
` The gods do dwell in all things.`
` ......In the same way, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama dwells on this island, in this mansion.`
` Like the gods, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama will do you no harm if you respect her."`
`"As you say, it is as though she doesn't exist...`
` However, if you ever fail to show proper respect, it will most certainly come back to haunt you.`
` ......Of course, that can be said of more than {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"Heh, if there's a curse, let's see it.`
` I'd just love to meet her."`
`"M‐Milady...!`
` You mustn't say such things...!"`
`"Ah, Milady..."`
`"You were splendid today..."`
`"Shannon, Gohda‐san.`
` You guys know about {f:5:Beatrice}, right?"`
`"......Huh?"`
`"W‐well, I do know of her, of course.`
` ......Why do you ask?"`
`The two looked at each other.`
`They looked like a pair who had just heard a clueless person suddenly utter a forbidden word...`
`"Let's have it straight.`
` Does she exist?`
` That ghost?!"`
`"......If it's a question of whether she exists or not,`
` ......I would have to say she doesn't...`
`probably."`
`"I,`
` ......I really do think...`
`...she does exist."`
`"And why do you say she "exists"?!`
` Have you ever met her?"`
`"I, ......I've never met her directly, ......but..."`
`Shannon talked in detail about how she would sometimes feel a strange presence...`
`or see a silhouette while doing the midnight rounds.`
` Jessica dismissed each example as it was given, saying Shannon must have seen it wrong or been mistaken.`
`"You haven't met her either, right, Gohda‐san?!"`
`"O‐......of course...`
` ......However,`
` .........well......"`
`He was being very evasive.`
`Even a man as big as Gohda was apparently unable to deny the existence of someone he'd never met.`
`.........This really didn't sit well with Jessica.`
`She was herself a resident of this mansion.`
`They were acting as though someone else, someone she didn't know, was living here.`
` ......Of course she didn't like it.`
`"Nn, wait a sec.`
` Tell that one again."`
`"Huh?`
` Y‐you mean...?"`
`"Th‐the story about the VIP room...?"`
`Gohda and Shannon had been recounting several ghost stories about {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`One of those drew a reaction from Jessica...`
`"Yeah, that one.`
` Sounds pretty cool...!"`
`Gohda and Shannon glanced at each other.`
` They hadn't been trying to talk about anything "cool".`
`"The VIP room...`
`...is never to be entered at two in the morning—`
`is that the one you mean?"`
`"The one about how {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama returns to the VIP room at two o'clock every morning,`
` ......so you mustn't go near it?"`
`"Yeah, that's it.`
` Pretty cool.`
` All the other stories are about people saying they heard or saw something they thought was {f:5:Beatrice}, but this one isn't.`
` This one says that, if you go to the VIP room at two in the morning, you can actually meet {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...!"`
`"W‐well, ......I, I wonder......"`
`"Milady...`
` They say that servants who speak ill of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama will be cursed.`
` Furthermore, the VIP room is {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's room..."`
`"......Even you, Milady, ......should probably reconsider......"`
`"The VIP room is locked now, right?`
` Where's the key?"`
`"Was that key......in the key box...?"`
`"I, I think Genji‐sama keeps that key by his own chair."`
`"The master key can open it, right?`
` Let me borrow yours."`
`"I, I cannot do such a thing...!"`
`"Milady, you mustn't approach an ill‐omened place without reason..."`
`"Hold it, don't you go calling my house ill‐omened.`
` Anyway, I've made up my mind.`
` If you can't give me your master key, there's still that key for the VIP room, right?`
` Let me borrow it."`
`"............M‐...Milady......"`
`To Jessica, it was their two expressions that felt more like an ill omen than anything else did.`
`It wasn't the witch or the VIP room that felt foreboding to Jessica.`
` It was {i:them}, Maria and the others who believed in witches.`
`In the end, Jessica forced them to agree, and she made them bring her the key to the VIP room...`
`"A classic test of courage, to see if {f:5:Beatrice} would really appear in the VIP room or not."`
`"Pretty much.`
` ......Still, I wonder why I was so stubborn about it.`
` It must have been because of my fight with such a little girl."`
`......Of course, the weather just had to be terrible on that particular night.`
`To be honest, I slightly regretted sticking my nose into something so pointless.`
`But I'd already said so much, and even borrowed the key from them.`
`I couldn't just go to Shannon the next day, let her ask me how it went,`
` and answer "well, I got scared so I gave up,`
` tehehe......"`
` That'd just be pathetic.`
`Normally, I go to sleep long before {nobr:2 a.m}.`
`If Mom found me wandering the corridors at that time of night, she'd definitely yell at me.`
`So, I waited in my room, staring at the hands of my clock as it ticked closer to {nobr:2 a.m}.`
`Outside, the rain was incredible, and the wind strong.`
`{n}The swaying, rustling trees were particularly creepy.`
`I'd complained to Shannon and Gohda about making up ghost stories for my house,`
` ......but I was starting to feel as though they had a bit of a place after all.`
`......The Ushiromiya mansion is huge.`
`Honestly, I can't think of the entire mansion as my own house.`
`As Mom says, the hallways of the Ushiromiya mansion should be treated like public roads.`
`In other words, my own room is part of my home, ......but the hallways and the rooms I don't usually enter are "outside".`
`So, while part of me felt that this VIP room ghost story was ridiculous,`
` ......the other part of me was so creeped out that it kept trying to convince itself that the first part of me was right.`
`Ten to two.`
`If I want to greet {nobr:2 a.m.} inside the VIP room, I need to have already gone in there before then.`
`"......Guess it's time.`
` ......Sorry, but I'm not giving up that easy."`
`Nothing's going to happen.`
` I know that.`
`{n}It'll just be a stupid waste of time for a few minutes.`
`I touched the doorknob to the door of my room...`
`...and was startled by how unpleasantly cold it was.`
`As long as I stayed in this room, I could laugh off anything.`
`After all, this was {i:my} room.`
`But it wouldn't be like that in the hallway.`
` ......That's...outside my territory.`
`And the doorknob, the barrier between the two, was ice‐cold...`
`......Idiot...`
` What are you so scared of, me?`
`You aren't taking Shannon's, Gohda‐san's, ...or maybe Kumasawa‐san's gossip seriously, are you...?`
`I'll prove it! There's nothing strange in the VIP room...!!`
`The corridor was only dimly lit.`
`The hallways were brighter before "lights out".`
`But to avoid wasting energy or something like that, we kept the lights to a minimum at night.`
`So, even though I was inside my own house,`
` ......it was very obviously the middle of the night here.`
`......If Mom found out that I was wandering around at a time like this to do a test of courage in the VIP room, which I'm not supposed to go in,`
` I'd get in a lot of trouble.`
`To make sure she didn't find out, I tried to hide my breathing and my footsteps.`
`{n}......So, the silence felt unbelievably loud.`
`Even though it was so quiet, ......the eerie sound of the wind was loud in my ears.`
`The sound of twigs rustling.`
` The sound of some pillar in this old mansion creaking.`
`What's that sound like a beak tapping against glass?`
`Though it was so quiet, ......all of the little, suspicious sounds felt obnoxiously loud.`
`Damn, I'm an idiot.`
` Why couldn't I have brought a flashlight, at least?`
`A flashlight to use inside my own home?`
`{n}......Hah, that's even more idiotic...`
`I mumbled this to myself, hoping it would drown out the sound of the wind just a little...`
`.........Then, ......I saw it.`
` The door to the VIP room.`
`......The VIP room was supposedly reserved for important guests.`
`However, as far as I knew, it had never been used.`
`None of the guests who came to this mansion......had ever been given the right to use this room.`
`Though I'd been clutching the key all this time, it didn't feel warm at all.`
`{n}The icy metal tormented me ruthlessly.`
`Maybe that was a warning.`
` ......“If you go back to your comfortable room and hide in your bed, this night will pass like any other...”`
`"......Like hell I'm doing that.`
` I can't give up after coming this far."`
`The key had been freezing in my hand, urging me to turn back.`
`{n}......But the keyhole made no further attempt to stop me.`
`All that's left...`
`......is to turn the knob,`
` open the door,`
` ......and I'll be inside the VIP room.`
`......It's not like I've {i:never} been in the VIP room.`
`Long ago, when I would often play hide‐and‐seek or go exploring,`
` this room that I rarely entered had seemed unusual and exciting.`
`However, I got in trouble for going in, and was told that this room was important, so one mustn't enter without reason.`
` After that, they made a rule of locking up unused rooms, and I couldn't go in anymore.`
`......So, ...it's probably been several years since I last went into the VIP room.`
` In fact, ......it might be more than a decade.`
`The inside of the room is probably different from how it was when I knew of it.`
`......Come to think of it, even then, I felt that there was something unsettling about this room...`
`Slowly, I pushed the door open.`
`It was light, ......and even after I let go of it, it kept opening by itself, as though beckoning me in...`
`Beyond it......was a darkness as thick and heavy as ink...`
`Even the dim light that seeped in from the corridor seemed bright in contrast.`
`......Swallowing hard,`
` ......I stuck my head in, feeling about for the light switch next to the doorway.`
`This was a horribly unnatural and awkward way to do it.`
`{n}......All I really had to do was step inside and search for the switch from there.`
`Unwilling to take even a single step into the room,`
` ......I timidly stuck just my arm into the darkness and felt along the wall...`
`"............There..."`
`Click.`
`The switch, which was hardly ever used, felt stiff and lifeless.`
`However, once the light turned on, the darkness vanished in an instant.`
`And there,`
` ......exactly as it had been,`
` ......as though not a thing had changed in all these years,`
` ...was the VIP room.`
`......The curtain and bed cover might have been slightly different, and maybe the chairs and the like had changed too.`
`Still, .........if I had to put it in words, I'd call it the feel.`
`{n}......The stiff, lifeless feel of this room hadn't changed.`
`If I hang around here, someone might find me.`
` ......I'd rather not have Mom find me here.`
`I readied myself,`
` ......and though I hadn't even been able to bring myself to enter this room with the lights out,`
` .........I finally entered.`
`As soon as I closed the door, I felt an oppressive, suffocating sensation.`
`Alright, ......I've shut myself in the VIP room.`
` Come out, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`"......What time is it now...?"`
`I looked around the room, but I couldn't see any clock.`
`I'm not in the habit of wearing a watch around the house.`
` ......Damn.`
` Now I'm not sure what time it is.`
`Still, I know it's only a few minutes at most.`
`I tried to suppress my desire to use "going to get a clock" as an excuse to run away from this place...`
`......Even so, just standing around like this was boring.`
`When I looked around again, searching for something to sit on, ......I found something strange.`
`"............What's this?"`
`It had been placed on the side table next to the bed.`
`......If this room had been used often by someone, I'd have thought it was just one of their personal belongings.`
`But there was no one living in this room.`
`{n}So, ......it was impossible for this to belong to the room's owner.`
`"......What is this, an offering or something?`
` ......Creepy..."`
`It did look like an offering.`
`A small French doll was sitting on the side table.`
`The doll's hair...was gold.`
` ......It was wearing a black dress.`
`Just who managed to find this doll, and where?`
`There's no doubt that someone placed the doll here to symbolize {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`Does that mean...this doll is supposed to be the owner of this room, or something...?`
`And, as though it was an offering to that owner,`
` ......there sat a small plate with several cookies and wrapped chocolates.`
`It was all set out neatly, and there was no dust piled up on the doll.`
`......In other words, both the doll and the offering were being taken care of on a regular basis by the servants,`
` and kept in good condition along with the rest of the room.`
`Taken care of?`
` ......No, it was more than that.`
`It looked like an offering...no, like some sort of worship,`
` a prayer saying "please don't curse us"...`
`......So, while the doll was eerie enough by itself,`
` ......psychologically, it was even more unnerving to think about how it must have been kept safe and worshiped in a place like this.`
`"Stupid.`
` ......Am I supposed to clap my hands together and say "please don't curse me"?"`
`Jessica forced herself to look away from the bizarre doll.`
`......She couldn't bring herself to sit on a bed that wasn't hers.`
`{n}Then again, she didn't really feel like sitting down on a chair either.`
`She had lost any desire to sit on anything in this room.`
`Wandering about aimlessly,`
` ......I peeked out the window through the gaps in the curtains to stare at the dark, rainy night.`
`......What the hell am I doing?`
`Hanging about in the VIP room this late just because that fight with Maria is still eating at me...`
` ......This is beyond stupid... I'm disappointed in myself.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}, huh...`
`Just when did that strange witch start living in this mansion...?`
`......Grandfather's always yelling about {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`Since it's apparently the name of his dead mistress, people started talking about how her ghost must haunt this mansion.`
`There's that kids' horror story about the witch in the forest,`
` which might be a ghost story made by the adults to stop the kids from going in there.`
`The portrait Grandfather had hung in April was really striking.`
`And there was also that weird epitaph.`
` ......The creepy words on that, which sounded like some sort of ritual with human sacrifices, made the name of {f:5:Beatrice} seem all the more unnerving.`
`At some point, those stories mixed together, and they now say that the witch {f:5:Beatrice} exists.`
`......I don't believe in {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`because I know she's just a fictional person made by the fusion of a few horror stories.`
`The "Beatrice" who was Grandfather's mistress probably did exist.`
`But she wasn't a witch.`
`The story of the witch of the forest was made up by the adults to prevent their kids from getting lost in the woods.`
` But that was just a made‐up story, not reality.`
`In fact, I've heard that kids were once threatened about wolves living in the forest.`
` Apparently, the kids realized that wolves couldn't exist on the island, so it was changed to the witch.`
`When the portrait was hung,`
` ......that once‐vague character suddenly had a face,`
` and people acted as though she'd been around since long ago.`
`......That's right, it's all a ghost story someone made, a fiction.`
`And Maria calls {f:5:Beatrice} her best friend, and the servants worship her like a household shrine.`
`I just don't get it, and it creeps me out......`
`".........! ..........................."`
`The sudden ring of the phone made me jump so hard I thought my heart would explode.`
`There was a phone on the bedside table across from the one with the doll,`
` and it was ringing noisily.`
`However, I was only surprised by the first ring.`
`By the time it had rung three times, I'd regained my cool enough to grumble about this being a prank done by someone trying to scare me.`
`......If I rush to pick it up, I'll probably hear someone laughing at me, saying "were you scared?"`
`I thought about ignoring it instead, .........but it kept on ringing incessantly.`
`It's a pretty loud sound to have going on and on this late at night.`
` If Mom somehow manages to hear it from her room, I'm screwed.`
`"......Okay, okay, I've got it, I've got it.`
` Might as well say "ya scared me" or whatever..."`
`I decided to pick up the receiver.`
`I'll just say "that surprised me, wahahaha",`
` and maybe follow that up with "looks like {f:5:Beatrice} didn't show up after all".`
`After all, this is my victory, in a sense.`
`".........Hello?"`
`‘Uu!`
` Hi, {f:5:Beatrice}...!’`
`"Huh?`
` M‐......Maria...?!"`
`I don't get it.`
`Did I hear that wrong...?`
` Why would Maria be calling here...?!`
`"H‐hello...?!"`
`‘Thanks for teaching me that fun song last time.`
` In return, I'm gonna sing you a song, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I just learned this one!`
` Uu!’`
`The voice, the intonation, the manner of speech—all of it clearly belonged to Maria.`
`{n}But......what's she talking about, all by herself...?`
`Maria just kept on talking happily as I stood there, stunned and unable to interrupt.`
`Eventually, Maria started singing an old, familiar kids' song that even I knew.`
`I don't...get it.`
`"......Maria? Hello...?`
` Wait a sec, stop singing...!`
` What's going on?`
` I don't get it...!`
` Hello?!`
` Ah—"`
`The voice, the lights—everything disappeared.`
`{n}In the pitch‐black, I couldn't see anything, couldn't tell what was happening.`
`{n}I don't get it, what's going on?!`
`"What...`
`.........the hell...`
`.........was that......?"`
`Does being in darkness really slow us humans down so much...?`
`I know it's dark, ......but I really do have absolutely no idea what just happened.`
`......What was that shuffling sound just now?`
` I, I'm not sure... I can't explain it.`
`It was a loud sound like someone crawling out of bed.`
`I wouldn't say something as non‐committal as I "felt like" I heard it.`
` I wouldn't say something as vague as I "sensed a presence".`
` I definitely heard it, right next to me, clearly.`
`However, there was no change to the bed.`
`{n}No one had been sleeping there in the first place, and the sheets were still perfectly straight.`
`Someone had crawled out of the bed,`
` .........and had laughed in a creepy voice before leaving the room......`
` ............That's...`
`...what it felt like.`
`Felt like?`
` I'm here, and the bed's right there.`
`I'm not only in the same room, I'm right next to it.`
` ......So, why am I so unsure about what happened just a few seconds ago?!`
`I gripped the receiver, which had gone completely silent,`
` .........and waited there alone, unable to move, in a quiet room that seemed exactly identical to the one I had first entered...`
`............Huh?`
` ............What............?`
`If nothing had changed since the beginning, ......I could just pretend that the last minute or so didn't happen.`
`However,`
` ......if something had changed,`
` ......that would be proof that something really did happen...`
`"......The hell?`
` ......Where'd...`
`......it go......?"`
`Did it fall to the floor...?`
` No, it's not there.`
` ......No matter where I look, from whatever angle, ......it's not there.`
`Though the offering plate with the cookies and chocolate is still here,`
` .........the thing they were being offered to,`
` the doll, is gone.`
`"......No way.................."`
`Then, ......what just happened......?`
`Is the {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama doll supposed to have cackled out loud and left the room...?`
`No, that crawling sound was too loud to have been made by a doll.`
`It was a noisy sort of sound, like a kid playing with a blanket and using it as a cape.`
`Then, what......?`
`Is that {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama doll...`
`supposed to have turned into a human...`
`......and then run cackling from the room...?`
`"No......way....................."`
`After that, nothing happened.`
`{n}The doll alone disappeared, .........and nothing else changed.`
`In a VIP room that had remained completely unchanged and was filled only with the sound of wind and rain,`
` ......I stood there, too shocked to move......`
`"Did you ever find that doll?"`
`"......I looked everywhere, even under the bed.`
` I literally crawled in there looking for it.`
` ......But I didn't find it."`
`"Just what do you think happened in that room?"`
`"I don't think it was actually "{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's curse".`
` ......It might have been a prank done by the servants."`
`"A prank?"`
`"Maybe they recorded Maria's voice on a cassette tape or something ahead of time.`
` They then called at exactly {nobr:2 a.m.} and pushed the play button.`
` They could've cut the power at the breaker or something."`
`"......Then, someone who had been hiding in the VIP room beforehand would make a creepy laugh, take the doll, and leave.`
` .........If that was how it happened, everything does fit."`
`"Doesn't sound like you're really convinced it happened that way."`
`"Can you blame me?`
` ......I mean, if that was just a prank to scare me, it was way too elaborate."`
`They made Maria sing beforehand and recorded it.`
`Then, someone called the VIP room and replayed that recording.`
`Then, someone waited until exactly the right time and tripped the breaker for the VIP room.`
`To turn off the power to the VIP room, you'd have to go down to the basement.`
` ......There's a breaker box down in the boiler room.`
`There's no phone line down there, so you'd need a different person to play back Maria's tape.`
`And you'd need another person to hide in the VIP room and cackle before leaving.`
`And......just how long would this last person have to hide in the VIP room beforehand...?`
`How long would they have to hide in the pitch‐black VIP room—under the bed, for example—`
`waiting to scare Jessica, who might or might not come...?`
`"......There's no way it could be a witch's curse.`
` ......But still.`
` Imagining that so many people planned everything down to the slightest detail...`
`and waited for several hours in the darkness just to scare me...?`
` To me, that's even creepier......"`
`"I agree.`
` I'd much prefer a curse.`
` ......Did you ask the servants about that later on?"`
`"What's the point? They'd just play dumb, of course.`
` ......And there had to have been at least three of them...`
` On that day, only Genji‐san, Gohda‐san, Kumasawa‐san, and Shannon stayed the night.`
` So three of those four helped out with that creepy prank?`
` It doesn't make sense...!`
` That's why......I couldn't ask about it."`
`".............................."`
`True, it had been a strange experience for her, but it wasn't something completely impossible for humans to do.`
`......Even so, it really must have been more unnerving to imagine a large number of people planning so carefully just to scare Jessica.`
`......It's no surprise that she found this scarier than {f:5:Beatrice}'s curse.`
`"Do you still believe the servants pulled a fast one on you?"`
`".........No.`
` I probably......just freaked out and mistook what I saw and heard.`
` The doll probably just fell somewhere, and I just had trouble finding it."`
`"Are you trying to say you imagined the whole thing...?"`
`"Other than the doll disappearing, there was no other proof that anything had changed.`
` ......Later on, I talked to Maria, and she said she didn't know anything about that song or the phone call.`
` I don't know if she was lying or not, of course.`
` ......Anyway, what happened that night...`
`...is just something I thought happened...`
`...and there's no proof of any kind."`
`"That's ironic.`
` Even if you had met {f:5:Beatrice} directly, you wouldn't have been able to prove that either."`
`"For a while, I was pretty rattled about it, ......but as time went on,`
` I began to think that lightning or something had shut off the power for a second and spooked me,`
` ......and maybe one of the trees in the garden fell while making rustling sounds, which I mistook for someone crawling out of bed because I was already scared."`
`"And the laugh?"`
`"Maybe some strange bird.`
` ......Anyway, I might have misheard something to get that sound..."`
`".........I act tough, but it turns out I'm actually an unbelievable coward.`
` ...That's why I let my imagination get ahold of me.`
` ......I decided to think about it that way......and kept firmly repeating it to myself to help me forget everything that happened that night."`
`"So it all remains in darkness..."`
`".........People are actually pretty good at forgetting things if they try.`
` ......Ever since that night, I feel uncomfortable every time I hear the word "{f:5:Beatrice}".`
` But I try hard to not let it show on my face."`
`"...................................."`
`"............That's all.`
` I can't tell you any more than that."`
`"It's really embarrassing, so please don't tell anyone.`
` .........I don't want them knowing what a huge chicken I was."`
`"You got it.`
` ......I have one last question."`
`"About the VIP room?"`
`"No.`
` About the dining hall."`
`"The dining hall?"`
`"On the day of the family conference, just before your ghost story, all of the relatives were gathered in the dining hall, right?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Except Battler hadn't come back to the family yet.`
` Everyone else was there.`
` ......Everyone except Grandfather, of course."`
`"And Ange wasn't in the room because of her stomachache.`
` ......Her seat was next to yours, wasn't it?"`
`"Yep."`
`"Was that the seat to your right?"`
`"Yeah, the seat to my right.`
` Why does it matter?`
` ...............?`
` ......Hm?`
` Wait...`
` ......That's strange, why to the......?"`
`"That's enough.`
` ......Try not to think. You'll just get a headache."`
`"What's up, Jessica?`
` Why the confused look...?"`
`"......Well, uh...`
`......right...`
`...left...`
` .........???"`
`"Hahah, you're so weird.`
` How is it going, Will?`
` Have George nii‐san and Jessica told you anything useful?"`
`"A bit.`
` That ghost story about {f:5:Beatrice} was pretty fun."`
`"Ghost story?`
` What are you talking about?"`
`"The one about {f:5:Beatrice}'s ghost appearing in the VIP room at two in the morning.`
` Pretty scary story."`
`"I've never heard of that.`
` ......I don't know who put that out there, but that'd be really rude, making up ghost stories about the woman our head is indebted to."`
`"A model answer.`
` ........................"`
`".........?`
` What?"`
`"Do you know about the epitaph, Lion?"`
`"Epitaph?`
` What epitaph?"`
`"That epitaph by {f:5:Beatrice}'s portrait."`
`".........My apologies,`
` but I have no idea what you mean."`
`"‘Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old’."`
`".........Just what...`
`are you talking about?"`
`"So, in your world, ......no, in this world,`
` the portrait exists, but not the epitaph?"`
`"Of course, I know about the large portrait of Beatrice hanging in the entrance hall.`
` ......But I haven't heard of this epitaph.`
` What is it?"`
`"........................`
` ......That's a very interesting difference.`
` .........You've lived on Rokkenjima all your life, right?"`
`"Of course.`
` What's your point?"`
`"When you were a little kid, you were warned not to go near the woods."`
`"Yes.`
` They always said to stay away, since it would be dangerous if we got lost."`
`"Because a witch lives in the forest?"`
`"A witch?`
` What witch?"`
`"The Golden Witch, ruler of Rokkenjima's night.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......Beatrice is a woman to whom Grandfather owes a great debt.`
` Don't you think it's a bit rude to treat her like a witch or a ghost?"`
`"...............You don't know about the witch {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"I know about the Beatrice who came here in a submarine along with the gold, and about her daughter, who was raised in the hidden mansion.`
` We just learned about those two together a short while ago, right?`
` Where does a witch come in?"`
`"...........................`
` I see, so that's it.`
` ......Then how did they scare you...to keep you from going into the woods?"`
`"They said that wolves lived in the forest."`
`".........Not a witch,`
` ...but wolves.`
` ......Of course.`
` Very interesting."`
`"It isn't interesting to me.`
` What are you talking about?`
` What is this witch?"`
`"I'm just talking to myself.`
` I have one more question."`
`"Please, go ahead."`
`"During the family conference, who sits to your right at the dining table?"`
`"My little sister, Jessica, sits across from me.`
` The next in rank is Aunt Eva's son.`
` So, George nii‐san is the one on my right... What's your point?"`
`"I get it.`
` ......It's all mashed together in a confusing mess.`
` But it is interesting."`
`"Well, I don't have a clue."`
