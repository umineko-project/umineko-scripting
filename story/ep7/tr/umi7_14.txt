`"........................"`
`"............This form is......"`
`"I'm lending it to you.`
` After all, I hate idiots.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*.`
` Call yourself Clair, as a temporary name.`
` Or would you prefer Beato?"`
`"........................`
` ...You have my gratitude.`
` This way, I won't have to expose my pitiful form."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} had given this person a fake form.`
`It was a temporary form for the person acting the part of {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}A false appearance intended for those yet to reach the truth of {f:5:Beatrice}'s identity......`
`"......Is that...`
`...a story about...`
`...me in another world?"`
`"Lion.`
` ......It is a tale about me, who is also another world's you.`
` ......The tale of the world where I live as a witch, not a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}..."`
`"............I sometimes imagine "what if" scenarios for my own life.`
` ......However,`
` ......the tale you tell...`
`...is beyond anything...`
`I can imagine..."`
`"Even so,`
` ......it's the life that another "you" has led."`
`"But still!`
` That doesn't mean I can accept it easily."`
`Lion suddenly yelled and looked at the floor.`
`{n}Lion already knew.`
`Because of the fragments provided by {f:5:Bernkastel}, Lion knew.`
`This was a different world, where the same person lived as the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`And, in this world, .........eventually,`
` ............on the day of the October 1986 family conference,`
` .........this person would be the ringleader of a terrible crime.`
`"......Even if it is a different world,`
` ......you're saying that I get my immediate and extended family and all of the servants involved in a terrible crime that I'm the mastermind of!`
` How am I supposed to deal with that?!"`
`"...............Be quiet, listen, and understand."`
`"In a different life, I end up as a servant!`
` And if that wasn't enough, I suddenly become a witch!`
` And then, I eventually carry out several horrifying murders...!`
` How am I supposed to "understand" that?!"`
`".............................."`
`"Yeah, that's what I expected you to say.`
` ......I doubt anyone could understand.`
` ......This person here's long past expecting anyone to understand.`
` That's why {i:you} are here.`
` ......That's why {f:5:Bernkastel} brought you two, two people who never could have met, together like this."`
`"............It's not like I had any deep reason for it.`
` It was just a whim."`
`"It's a motive that no one else can understand, Lion, so you need to be the one to understand it.`
` I'm not the main character in this tale.`
` You are.`
` .........I'm just here to help you understand."`
`"You said that you understood the culprit's motive."`
`"......Yeah."`
`"Is it...a satisfying motive...`
`for explaining why I'd kill my entire family...?!"`
`"Who knows.`
` That's for you to decide.`
` Even if I say it's satisfying, that doesn't mean it'll satisfy you.`
` ......You have to decide that for yourself."`
`"I really don't have a clue what's going on...!`
` I've seen several crimes called game boards that {f:5:Beatrice} supposedly carried out.`
` And now, I'm hearing another me talk about a different life from mine.`
` But none of that fits with the crime!`
` I don't understand!!"`
`"..................At this point in the tale, ......even I...`
`could not have dreamed that I would eventually carry out such a terrible crime.`
` In fact, even if I could have dreamed it,`
` .........I did not have the power to commit that crime at that time."`
`"Probably.`
` ......Your misfortune probably came...`
`...when you solved the epitaph's riddle."`
`".........Huh?`
` You mean that epitaph about the hidden gold, which Grandfather supposedly wrote...?!"`
`"There was a system by which the culprit obtained different accomplices each time the crime was committed.`
` .........Reasoning leads us to the possibility that the culprit possessed a vast amount of money.`
` And...`
`......for inviting all to the Golden Land...`
`......and making all loves bear fruit......there was one other system."`
`"...............So, it's not just the motive...`
`...that you've figured out."`
`"That's the answer to the final riddle in the fourth game.`
` ......Your greatest misfortune was solving the epitaph,`
` .........reviving as the Golden Witch in the truest sense, and gaining that magical power."`
`"......Looking back, ......perhaps that was an ill‐fortuned event.`
` .........I do not know.`
` However, as long as the fact that Battler‐san returns in 1986 remains unchanged,`
` .........some sort of tragedy would certainly have occurred."`
`"That's right.`
` ......If Battler had returned a year earlier or later,`
` .........that incident might not have occurred."`
`No, some small incident would probably have occurred.`
`And it would surely have been a mysterious, impossible incident, which no one could understand.`
`But even so, it would have been insignificant compared to the Rokkenjima Serial Murders......`
`"......If Battler‐kun...`
`...had returned a year earlier or later,`
` ......then what?"`
`"........................`
` ......Fate can be so filled with irony.`
` .........It made me walk the path of a witch, ......and when I solved the epitaph, I became a true witch.`
` ......Then, after six years, I learned of his return.`
` .........If all of that was fate,`
` .........then this crime must have been inevitable and inescapable for me."`
`"In 1980,`
` when Asumu, his mother, died, and his father remarried too soon for his liking, Battler left the Ushiromiya family in disgust.`
` And he was gone for six whole years."`
`He convinced his grandparents on his mother's side to help him and had his last name changed to his mother's maiden name.`
`Then, when those grandparents passed away, he finally made up with Rudolf...and returned to the Ushiromiya family again in 1986...`
`"That bad luck......gave birth to your motive for the crime."`
`".........I did think it.`
` ......‘Why, after six whole years,`
` .........have you come back now?’"`
`"I understand.`
` In a way, ......it would have been better for you if he had never come back."`
`"Of course, my suffering would have continued.`
` ......However, I may have avoided tainting myself with the unforgivable crime of mass murder."`
`".........How could Battler‐kun leaving the Ushiromiya family...`
`...create a motive?"`
`"You've got it backwards."`
`"......Backwards?"`
`"The crime didn't occur because Battler left.`
` .........It happened because Battler came back."`
`"...........................`
` ......The more I think about it, the more I realize.`
` ......Ushiromiya Battler.`
` ......What a detestable man he was.`
` More than anything else, because he never realized that the outbreak of the crime was his fault."`
`"He did remember, in the end.`
` ......However, that was long after you gave up and disappeared."`
`"............If that is so,`
` ......then it would give my heart some peace..."`
`"I still don't have a clue what you two are talking about.`
` ......But I'd like to ask you straightforwardly.`
` I want to know.`
` ......What on Earth happened to you that made you decide to commit the crime?"`
`"Yes.`
` That's the most important part.`
` ......Just like how Ushiromiya Battler respected the whydunit in mystery novels.`
` .........In the tale of the Golden Witch and in the game, ......the answers to all the riddles are hidden there."`
`"In that case,`
` .........allow me to continue.`
` ......1980.`
` ......Six years before I resolved myself to commit the crime."`
`"......Battler‐sama has...`
`......left the Ushiromiya family......?"`
`"That's what Krauss‐sama and Rudolf‐sama were saying!`
` What a shock!"`
`"You have your own way of life and your own family situation.`
` I have no intention of criticizing those.`
` However, Father is in a towering rage.`
` Disinheriting a son is one thing, but I've never even heard of a child becoming so fed up with his family that he changed his own name."`
`"......No idea who he gets it from,`
` but that Battler's as stubborn as a mule."`
`"If you are unable to understand Battler‐kun's feelings, I believe that would make you a failure as a father."`
`"That's enough.`
` I'm sure Rudolf was just trying to show his commitment to raising Kyrie‐san's child properly."`
`"That would be perfectly satisfactory if it happened next year.`
` ......But why this year?`
` He's still in a period of mourning.`
` ......If you consider the timing of this pregnancy, one must acknowledge that Rudolf‐san has acted disgracefully."`
`"............Come on, don't be so harsh.`
` ......This is my way of atoning for what I've done..."`
`"Battler‐kun feels as though he's resisting you for the sake of his departed mother, Asumu‐san.`
` ......I deeply understand how he feels.`
` If he were here, I would like to hold him and cry along with him."`
`Natsuhi's words were sharp.`
` They pierced Rudolf mercilessly.`
`Rudolf had no retort.`
`{n}His relationship with Kyrie had been improper, plain and simple.`
`......According to Rudolf, he had been close to Kyrie longer than Asumu.`
`And, even after his marriage to Asumu, that relationship had not disappeared......`
`What the hell?!`
` You old bastard!!`
`So what you're telling me is, you've been betraying Mom all this time!!`
`Sure, I know Kyrie‐san.`
` You've told me that she was your business partner and a friend whose advice you can always rely on!`
`Now you're telling me she was more than that all along, and you think I give a damn about that now?!!`
`If all this had happened after Mom died, that'd be your own damn business!`
` I'd be right there with you, saying that you should live life as you please!`
`But just when did Kyrie‐san get pregnant?!`
` Back when Mom was still alive, right?!`
`Yeah, now I finally get it!`
` This is why looking at you makes me feel sick to my stomach!`
`You were {i:glad} when Mom died, weren't you? Weren't you?!`
`It must have been so hard on you, keeping your infidelity and even a kid secret while Mom was still alive!!`
`And now that Mom conveniently kicked it, you get to marry Kyrie‐san and make the kid my new little brother or sister... The nerve of you!!`
`Mom is crying her eyes out in heaven!!`
` You should be ashamed of yourself, you should be ashamed!!`
` {i:I} am!!`
` I am goddamn ashamed to have the same last name as you!!`
` The kid's done nothing wrong.`
` He or she'll need two parents to look after him or her.`
` So you go ahead and build a new family and give that kid a happy life!!`
`But don't expect any forgiveness from me!!`
`'Cause Mom isn't even here to hate you anymore!!`
` So I'm gonna hate you in her place!!`
` With all of my body and soul!!`
` So long, you old bastard!!`
`"................................."`
`"That is enough, Natsuhi.`
` ......Rudolf hasn't lost the affection he feels for Battler‐kun.`
` ......It may take some time, but he wants to fix their relationship one day."`
`"No less should be expected of him as a father.`
` ......Battler‐kun is not a stranger.`
` He is Rudolf‐san's flesh and blood, and Rudolf‐san has a bounden duty to repair their relationship."`
`".........Go ahead.`
` Heap it on me.`
` I won't argue back.`
` ......That's the only way I can atone."`
`"At the very least, make sure you give the new child a happy life."`
`"............The new kid......and Battler.`
` ......They're both my kids."`
`"Wedding Kyrie‐san after Asumu‐san's death...`
`...may have been painful for Battler‐kun, but it was the best choice you could make for the coming child.`
` ......I understand why you did it."`
`"And I understand why Battler‐kun felt like accusing you of being glad when Asumu‐san passed away."`
`"Stop, Natsuhi.`
` ......Rudolf has already been scolded enough from the person most fit to do so."`
`"......Now then, how about some black tea?`
` Would you mind asking someone in the kitchen to make us some?"`
`"...............Very well."`
`Natsuhi took this as a signal to leave the room and did so.`
`Once she left, Krauss relaxed slightly.`
`"............It is a terrible shame about Asumu‐san,`
` ......but considering the best interests of the coming child, the timing of all this might have been fortuitous."`
`"It's almost as though Asumu...`
`...knew about it, and stepped down from the stage of her own choosing.`
` .........Was I the one who killed her...?`
` .........If so, ......how long ago did I start...?"`
`"If you still treasure Asumu‐san's memory,`
` ......then, though it may take several years, you must fix your relationship with Battler‐kun."`
`".........Yeah.`
` ......I know."`
`"And be sure to pour just as much affection on Kyrie‐san and the new child that is to be born.`
` ......While also bearing Asumu‐san's cross."`
`"..............................`
` .........If they have reserved seating in hell..."`
`"......Hmm?"`
`"I hope that one of their finest seats...`
`...has got my name on it......"`
`"..........................."`
`The news that Battler had left the Ushiromiya family swept across the family.`
`"How terrible for Battler‐san, too......`
` I do believe that they will make up eventually, but......"`
`"......This is a matter for the family.`
` We servants have nothing to do with it.`
` Instead, we should focus on memorizing the face of the newest member of the Ushiromiya family, Kyrie‐sama."`
`"Yes, that's true.`
` She will be coming to the family conference this year......"`
`If the person new to the Ushiromiya family would be coming to the conference...`
`......Then what about the person who just left...?`
`"That means Battler isn't coming, right?"`
`"That seems the most probable outcome.`
` How lonely is the loss of a single, noisy man."`
`Though most people felt that it was sad to see Battler leave the Ushiromiya family and that he would be missed, they didn't think any more about it than that.`
`However, .........what about Shannon?`
`Wasn't Battler supposed to come for her on a white horse......?`
`At first, I was shocked.`
`Because I immediately thought that his departure from the family meant that he wouldn't be coming to this island anymore.`
`......And I do think that's understandable given how he must feel.`
`I understand painfully well why he wanted to leave his family...`
`But, ......does that really mean he won't come to Rokkenjima anymore...?`
`What on Earth is going on?`
`{n}Will he really never return?`
`Unable to ask him this directly, I was forced to spend each day contending with a growing sense of anxiety...`
` ......Battler‐san.`
`{n}I understand how you feel......`
`But............`
`.........You wouldn't leave this place behind forever just because you broke away from the Ushiromiya family, would you...?`
` ......Tell me it isn't true......`
`I was so confused that the world seemed to be spinning around me...`
`I felt tightness in my chest, and I couldn't think at all.`
`When I happened to touch my cheek,`
` ......I was surprised to find it hot and wet.`
`......With a miserable expression on my face,`
` I was...`
`...crying......`
`{a:c:`
`Shannon......`
`...Shannon.........}`
`From far away, ......I could hear someone calling to me.`
`{n}But it was a very strange sort of distance.`
`Though it felt very far away, ......the voice also seemed to be coming from right beside me.`
`"......Shannon.`
` I understand......how you must be feeling..."`
`"It's okay.`
` ......It's just a fight between a boy and his father.`
` And rumors always blow things out of proportion.`
` Everything's just being exaggerated."`
`"Indeed.`
` There are none who can say with certainty that Battler will not return to this island.`
` You would do well to remain strong."`
`......Where......is this place......?`
`I seem to remember it somehow.`
`It's like it reminds me of the scenery of a strange dream I once had.`
`{n}......Then, ......this must be another dream......`
`I was there, under an arbor in a golden rose garden,`
` ......and two witches in white and red dresses were showering words of encouragement upon me...`
`"You can be sure that those rumor‐mongering young servants are embellishing the story however they please.`
` That he has {i:changed his name} is obviously a gross exaggeration!`
` Surely, this can be nothing more than a family quarrel."`
`"........................`
` ......Thank you.`
` ......I wish I could believe that..."`
`"Of course that's true.`
` He's a boy, after all.`
` You can hardly be surprised that he has a few arguments with his dad."`
`"Precisely, as you say.`
` Clearly, they will make it up to each other once they cool their heads."`
`"Arguments between men flare up quickly, but they burn out just as fast."`
`"In contrast, an argument between women never bursts into flame, but smolders and lasts forever.`
` Men's arguments are fierce but short!`
` Quick and easy."`
`"......You're right.`
` ......I hope Battler‐san and Rudolf‐sama...`
`...make up soon..."`
`"Oh, they will!`
` Haven't you heard all the times Battler has spoken of it?`
` He always fights with his father!`
` This is just another of those fights.`
` His mother's death and his father's remarriage have upset him—that is all."`
`"It sounds as though he's gone to live with his mother's parents, but he'll come back after he's had a few days to cool his head.`
` You know, like a kid running away from home."`
`The two witches kept saying that Battler's fight hadn't been anything huge.`
`......If it was just a family quarrel, the rumors wouldn't have started in the first place.`
` I just can't feel optimistic about this...`
`"In any case,`
` this is a problem between Battler and his father.`
` Have patience, and time will heal all wounds!`
` Matters will not be helped by you worrying about it."`
`"Just because Battler didn't come today doesn't mean we can be sure he'll never come.`
` All this means is that Rudolf came alone today."`
`"Very true.`
` Of course he will appear at the next family conference, as energetic as ever!`
` By then, Rudolf will probably bring that Kyrie here too.`
` Battler may be sulky about it, but I am certain that he will come too!"`
`"......You're right.`
` ......Yeah.`
` .........I'm sure...you're right."`
`How nice would it be if they were right...`
`In fact, if I could, I'd like to flip through the calendar until autumn right now and check to see whether he does come to the next conference.`
`If he does, then all of my fears are groundless.`
`It would mean the rumor‐mongering family members and servants just blew things out of proportion......`
`If Battler‐san were right here, I'd like to question him right away...`
` "Hey, it isn't true that you'll never come to Rokkenjima again, right...?"`
`If I could just hear him say "of course not", ......I could stop worrying about it...`
`I don't know the phone number for Rudolf‐sama's house, but I could probably look it up if I tried.`
`However, as a servant of the family, I have no excuse for making the call.`
`And anyway, I have no way of finding out the phone number at Battler‐san's grandparents' house......`
`All I can do is wait for Rudolf‐sama's family to come visit and hope that my fears are groundless......`
`However, will I be able to make it through the day feeling like this...?`
`No way.`
` I doubt I'll sleep a wink tonight.`
`Just waiting around, feeling like this, ......when I don't know when my next chance will come...`
` I can't do that...`
`Will it be next month?`
` Or the month after?`
`{n}......In the worst case, I might have to wait until the next family conference.`
`And I have to wait that long......while holding back this suffocating feeling......`
`......I can't bear it.........`
`"Hey, Shannon.`
` Sorry for asking this out of the blue,`
` ......but when you said that by the next year you'd have made a resolved decision about something, that something wasn't just quitting work as a servant on this island, right?"`
`"......Huh? ......Well, I.........`
` ........................"`
`It was......to make up my mind to start a new life.`
`Instead of remaining a servant by force of habit.`
`I'm supposed to resolve to step into a new life and leave my old life as a servant behind.`
`"And Battler promised that he'd come here on the day you make that resolved decision, right...?"`
`".........Ummm,`
` .........yes..."`
`"Tact is not one of my strong points, so I shall speak frankly.`
` You are supposed to resolve to start a new life with Battler, correct...?"`
`"......A new life...`
`...with...Battler‐san..."`
`"You are afraid that Battler will not come for you on the day of your decision.`
` However, there is more to that day of decision than just Battler coming to see you."`
`"It's also the day for you to show your resolve to spend the rest of your life with Battler."`
`"That resolve is yours to create.`
` It is not something that will be created automatically upon Battler's visit."`
`"......Shannon.`
` Are you already resolved to spend the rest of your life with him?`
` You decided to put it off until the next family conference because you didn't have that resolve the last time, right?"`
`"What does it mean to live life with Battler?`
` Have you ever thought seriously about it in detail?"`
`"Well, .........uh............"`
`As long as I'm working as a servant on Rokkenjima, my opportunities for meeting him are limited.`
`We're both underage, so it's too early to talk about......umm......marriage.`
`However, if I quit working as a servant, I should have many more opportunities to meet him.`
`Once I quit work here, ......I'll return to the Gospel House.`
`I have my wages for serving the family, so I should have more than enough to make visits to Battler‐san's house.`
`And when I graduate from school, I can rent an apartment near to Battler‐san's house.`
`Then, well......I can work while going to school.`
`{n}That life will be a lot more difficult than my vague conception of it.`
`......However, I'll be able to see Battler‐san much, much more often.`
`{n}If not every day, then every week.`
`I won't be a servant anymore, so we'll finally be equals.`
` ......I'll be allowed to call him whenever I want.`
`And I'm already balancing school and work.`
`Thanks to my experience here, I know more than enough to do simple housework......`
`"......Doesn't that sound like a fun life?`
` You can rent a humble abode, and once you've built up your own home, you can invite Battler over."`
`"And then, the time you spend together, the world the two of you make, will begin.`
` Doesn't that sound wonderful?"`
`".........Y‐`
`......yes.`
` ......It does sound a bit...`
`...wonderful......"`
`This was the first time I had ever imagined that future clearly.`
`I've been able to appreciate the feeling of my love for him...`
`......and my honest desire to live my life with him.`
`However, now that I have a clear picture of the future I plan to choose, I finally understand.`
`I need to mentally commit myself to embarking on this future.`
`"You dream of...`
`......marriage, eventually, don't you?"`
`"Hohoh!`
` Girls these days, dating with marriage in mind at such a young age...!"`
`"W‐well, that's a bit, umm......"`
`"Don't deny your dreams, okay?`
` There's no point in taking a first step if your eyes are closed and you don't look to the future."`
`"If a girl's in love with a man, there's nothing wrong with thinking "I wanna marry hi~m"!`
` That's a young girl's natural right."`
`My face had turned bright red.`
`Before today, I had thought that considering marriage really was a bit premature, and I had been trying my best not to think about it.`
`......However, now that the witches had encouraged me to imagine it, that image was both exciting and fresh.`
`I felt an indescribable feeling of refreshment and awakening,`
` ......like the gentle breeze that washes over you when you go outside during a brief spot of sunshine on a rainy day.`
`Certainly, I hadn't yet reached that level of resolve.`
`I need to create that resolve by the time the next family conference comes around.`
`If I can't do that, then sticking around as a servant on this island is no more than I deserve.`
`"And at the same time, this is also a trial."`
`"True.`
` A trial to be overcome."`
`"......A trial...?`
` Why is that...?"`
`"Fool.`
` Battler promised that he would come for you at the next family conference, did he not?"`
`"He said he'd come on a white horse, right?"`
`"Y‐......yes......"`
`"You are thinking that Battler will not come anymore.`
` In other words, you have no trust in Battler's promise."`
`"That's why this is a trial.`
` To pass through this trial, you'll have to show that you can trust him and wait."`
`".........A trial......"`
`I never thought of it that way.`
`Since he promised to come for me in a year...`
`{n}I must believe that he will come for me in a year.`
`......If I doubt that, I don't have the right to wait for him in the first place.`
`..............................`
`"In fact, the reason that Battler left the Ushiromiya family might have been...`
`that he has his sights set on a future with you."`
`"Oh, why would that be?"`
`"If he knows that you will live together and eventually exchange marriage vows,`
` having the name Ushiromiya could cause problems, since Shannon is a servant of the Ushiromiya family."`
`"Ah, I see!`
` He realizes that there'll be all kinds of trouble if he decides to marry a servant girl, so he's abandoned the Ushiromiya name beforehand...!"`
`"What do you think, Shannon?!`
` That way, everything makes sense!`
` Battler has abandoned the Ushiromiya name for your sake!`
` This sudden argument with Rudolf was undoubtedly just an excuse."`
`"What splendid reasoning!`
` Nice going, Riiche!"`
`"Wahahahahahahahahaha...!`
` What do you say, Shannon?`
` There's no reason to feel down!`
` On the contrary, it is as though Battler has shown his resolve first!"`
`"......*giggle*.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*......"`
`A smile finally returned to my face.`
`{n}Of course, I hadn't taken the witches seriously and let myself be reassured.`
`The opposite, in fact.`
` It was just funny that they could think up such ridiculously convenient explanations for everything.`
`However, they had made all of those ridiculous theories to cheer me up.`
`......The witches are right when they say that I must trust Battler‐san...`
`and that there's no point moping about just because I've heard a few rumors.`
`By the date of the next family conference, I intend to have a firm resolve to live my life with him.`
`And......I believe that he'll accept my feelings and come for me.`
`The idea that Battler left the family so that he could be married to me some day...`
`......is laughable, of course.`
`But right now, I should try to feel confident enough to accept even crazy ideas like that.`
`"............Thanks so much.`
` ......I feel a little better now."`
`"That is well.`
` I cannot stand watching you dampen your pillow with tears."`
`"Thanks for coming into my dreams to encourage me."`
`"Yes.`
` ......It will be morning soon.`
` This is all a dream.`
` You will surely have forgotten it when you wake up.`
` However, your heart will be at peace."`
`".........Yes.`
` ......I'll believe in him...and wait.`
` ......So, I won't listen to every little rumor."`
`"Very good.`
` Wait until the next conference while improving yourself.`
` If you think of it as training to become a wife, all of your everyday chores will grow more meaningful!"`
`"*giggle*.`
` ......Thanks a lot."`
`"......Riiche.`
` It'll be morning soon."`
`"Is that so?`
` Then so long, Shannon.`
` ......You may not remember me,`
` but I will always be by your side, watching over you......"`
`"Thank you......`
` ......Thank you..."`
`"......The next family conference will be here in a flash.`
` ......Wait for it at your leisure......`
` Battler will certainly keep his promise........."`
`"Pleased to meet you.`
` .........My name is Kyrie.`
` I hope we can all become quick friends."`
`"I've known your name longer than I've known Asumu‐san's.`
` I hear you're Rudolf's old girlfriend."`
`"*giggle*.`
` Yes, we've known each other for quite a long time..."`
`"......Welcome to the Ushiromiya family.`
` I hope you find it easy to grow comfortable here."`
`"Yes.`
` I'd like to grow comfortable quickly, so that I can support my husband."`
`"But look at how cute that little girl is.`
` What's her name...?!"`
`"This is Ange‐chan.`
` What a cute name."`
`"............So, you two couldn't make up after all."`
`"I thought this would be the perfect chance to bring him back, but...`
` ......He's as stubborn as Dad."`
`"Will Battler‐kun ever come back...?`
` I'll miss him."`
`"Nothin' wrong with a man havin' the backbone to find his own way in the world.`
` I'm sure he'll make it big and come right back...!"`
`"You think so?`
` Right now, Battler‐kun's home isn't home for him.`
` There's no reason for him to go back there."`
`"......Enough.`
` This concerns Rudolf's family only.`
` It is not our place to meddle."`
`"Thank you, Krauss nii‐san.`
` ......This is an issue for our family alone.`
` However, I intend to do all I can to see that Battler‐kun and Rudolf‐san can live together again someday.`
` After all, he's Ange's one and only big brother."`
`"......Yep.`
` When that kid gets stuck on something, anything you say to him will have the opposite effect.`
` ......Asumu's father has a bit of a short temper.`
` Looks like he's been adding fuel to the fire."`
`"It'll be okay.`
` I'm sure he'll understand your feelings before too long."`
`"We can't do anything except cheer you on.`
` ......Even if he doesn't come back, we're all prayin' that the two of you will make up quickly."`
`"......It's kinda boring without Battler."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......I hope he and Uncle Rudolf can make up soon."`
`"............If you think about how Battler‐sama feels......it must be painful."`
`"It's like his family's suddenly changed around him...`
` ......It probably doesn't feel comfortable at home anymore."`
`"All men need to go out into the world one day or another.`
` It might just be that Battler‐kun's time has come."`
`"Do you think so......?"`
`"I do.`
` It's not cool for a guy to hang around at his parents' for too long.`
` You've got to leave the nest in a flurry and make your name in the world.`
` ......I planned to do that eventually, but it looks like he's gone and done it first."`
`"O‐once he makes his name in the world, ......do you think he will come back?"`
`"It may be......that he never comes back.`
` After all, this might be leaving the nest to him."`
`"......Leaving the nest....................."`
`"Battler didn't come, did he......"`
`"Oh, how terrible.`
` And I kept telling Shannon that he was sure to come.`
` .........I'm sure she feels very upset about Battler not coming.`
` And it's all because I irresponsibly raised her hopes...!"`
`"She's practically been living for the sake of this day...`
` It pains me to think of how she must feel."`
`"...............Thanks, you two.`
` ......I'm...okay."`
`I had been reunited with the witches once again in that dream world.`
`.........Though I could never remember anything during the day, now that I was in the dream world, I somehow knew that this was a reunion.`
`The witches both looked apologetic.`
`Though they had tried to cheer me up by saying that Battler would come today,`
` now that he hadn't come, it was like they had been lying, and they seemed to regret it heavily.`
`"Shannon,`
` ......umm...`
`...well......"`
`"......Thanks for your concern.`
` It'd be a lie to say I'm not sad,`
` .........but I'll be okay."`
`"Y‐you will?`
` You are certain?`
` ......That would be splendid, but......"`
`"Clearly, Battler's fight was so over‐the‐top that he couldn't bring himself to back down so soon.`
` Men are so stubborn."`
`"Y‐yes, that is true...!`
` He stormed out of the family with some very strong words, so his stubbornness is preventing him from taking back what he said so easily!`
` He probably regrets not coming today.`
` Yes, that must be it...!"`
`For some reason, ......they seemed nearly desperate in their attempts to encourage me.`
`It was almost funny to watch.`
` ......I couldn't help but giggle.`
`"Thanks a lot, both of you.`
` After all, .........you're the ones who told me in the first place.`
` That this is a test, a trial to be overcome."`
`The truth was, I couldn't really fool myself so easily.`
`When will he come back?`
`{n}When will he come for me?`
`{n}When...isn't the question.`
` ......Will he come for me, ever?`
`If I start moping right now, the uncertainty and sadness will probably tear me apart.`
`But they've taught me.`
`This is.........a test to see whether I really have faith in him or not.`
`The very fact that I feel uncertain and anxious is a betrayal of my resolve......and of his promise to come for me someday.`
`"George‐sama said something about it.`
` ......He said this might be the same as leaving the nest for Battler‐san."`
`"That's right.`
` This is his chance to leave behind the Ushiromiya name and spread his wings as his own man."`
`"If you really think about it, ......we're still very young.`
` Even if we want to be tied together, we're still lacking many years of social experience and trust.`
` If Battler‐san is really and truly taking this seriously, ......then it's too soon for him to come for me now."`
`"Well done.`
` Yes, that's the right attitude...!`
` You have done well to reach this understanding."`
`"......I haven't reached anything...`
` .........But I've decided to think of it that way for now.`
` This is a trial......to see whether I trust Battler‐san or not."`
`If he {i:had} showed up today,`
` ......then today, I would have had to inform Madam that I was quitting my job as a servant.`
`But was I mentally prepared for that?`
`I spent all last night worrying about whether Battler‐san would come or not.`
`I spent so much time worrying that not only was I not mentally prepared to quit my job, I didn't even prepare a letter of resignation.`
`......In short, I still don't have the "resolve" that I promised him that day.`
`I'm sure that God knew that.`
`{n}Battler is supposed to come for me when I've found my resolve.`
`I wasn't resolved, so it's only natural that he didn't come today......`
`..............................`
`......Yeah.`
` ...It all makes sense now.`
`"So,`
` ......I'm sure Battler‐san didn't come today......because I wasn't resolved enough.`
` It's only natural, since I couldn't even truly believe that he would come..."`
`"I'm sure Battler was the same way.`
` He did not yet have the resolve to come for you."`
`"......God isn't heartless.`
` When your feelings truly do draw close, I'm sure He'll bring the two of you together."`
`"Just like {c:86EF9C:Orihime and Hikoboshi}...!"`
`"Yes, it's as though the weather just happened to be bad during this year's Tanabata...`
` ......That's how I'd like to think about what happened today."`
`That's how...I'd like to think about it.`
`......I have no other choice.`
`..............................`
`......Battler‐san......`
`"But Battler‐kun didn't come back for......"`
`"Six years.`
` ......Still a long way to go until then."`
`"......So this agonizing wait continued for six whole years...?"`
`"When one waits every year for something to happen the next, and then the same thing the next year and the next,`
` ......it becomes similar to waiting for an eternity."`
`".........Pretty pathetic, don't you think?`
` After all, this promise you thought Battler made seems to be something he wasn't even conscious of, right?"`
`"Battler‐kun does tend to use melodramatic phrases, just like Uncle Rudolf.`
` ......His turns of phrase might have led to a misunderstanding..."`
`"Some girl's going to stab Battler in the back someday.`
` ......Well, that's more or less what this tale is."`
`".........When words carry significance, they can change the course of a person's life.`
` ......There are times...when careless talk can kill."`
`"...................................."`
