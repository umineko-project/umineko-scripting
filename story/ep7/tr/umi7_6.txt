`"......I think...`
`I now understand just how much the woman called Beatrice influenced Grandfather's life."`
`"We haven't learned anything.`
` "Who killed {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
` That's what we've got to figure out, or we'll never be able to get out of here."`
`"......You're right.`
` We need to finish this quickly.`
` The funeral is already over, after all."`
`"...........................`
` You've got it all wrong.`
` ......This {i:is}...`
`...the funeral."`
`"You mean, what she's making us do...?"`
`"None of the Beatrices we've heard about so far were {i:killed}.`
` ......We need to change that.`
` That's the real funeral, as far as {f:5:Bernkastel}'s concerned."`
`"............No one knows about the "killed" factor.`
` And that's the truth we're trying to expose?"`
`"Hmm, ......you are perceptive.`
` It hardly feels like I'm talking to a piece from the lower plane.`
` It must be because you were given to me as my Watson.`
` ............Ouch!"`
`"Don't call your partner a piece.`
` ......So, what next,`
` Willard Holmes?"`
`"The basis of investigation is asking questions.`
` There's still a {f:5:Beatrice} we need to ask about."`
`To indicate who they should talk to next, Will nodded in the direction of George, Jessica, and Maria.`
`Maria seemed to be lecturing the others about something.`
`"Wow.`
` {f:5:Beatrice} sounds pretty incredible."`
`"Yeah!`
` And then, inside the upside‐down cup,`
` she made tons of candies appear out of nowhere!"`
`"Inside the overturned cup?`
` That's wild.`
` Sounds like magic to me."`
`"......Maria‐chan really does love witches and magic."`
`"Can't pass up the chance to talk to the authority on witches, can we?"`
`If looking for someone to ask about {f:5:Beatrice}, Maria would rise to the top of the list.`
`The {f:5:Beatrice} she spoke of wasn't the real Beatrice spoken of by Kinzo and the others.`
`However, on the Rokkenjima of 1986, the being that the name {f:5:Beatrice} referred to was probably the {f:5:Beatrice} that Maria always talked about.`
`".........I don't see Battler anywhere."`
`Ushiromiya Battler.`
` ......The one who was made to fight as {f:5:Beatrice}'s opponent in many games, and the most important person in this game and this tale.`
`A Battler in this world would probably be the piece version, but even so, it should be possible to get some vital information out of him.`
`......Will probably wanted to talk with Battler too, but he was nowhere to be seen in the cousins' group.`
`"Battler‐kun isn't present at the funeral today.`
` It's a shame, seeing as he's the cousin closest in age to me."`
`"Are you two on good terms?"`
`"Yes, of course."`
`".........And you pinch his butt every time he says something perverted."`
`"Oh, how did you know?`
` Did your detective instincts tell you that?"`
`"Poor guy."`
`......{f:5:Bernkastel} said that everything was gathered here.`
`Since Battler isn't here, that probably means it's possible to find out everything without asking for his side of the story.`
`Or, maybe she's intentionally hiding the core elements and making us take the long way around, as part of some fickle witch's game.`
`"Since he isn't here, ......that probably means there's no need to hear his story for the time being.`
` ......Let's talk to Maria and the others.`
` ......I won't say anything perverted, so keep your hands off my ass."`
`"Then why not try choosing your words a bit more carefully?"`
`With a roguish smile, Lion pinched the air, index finger against middle.`
`"Ah, it's the {i:future heir}.`
` Are you done babysitting the old geezer?`
` .........Gyaah!"`
`At least Lion is impartial.`
` No mercy, even for Jessica.`
` Will felt a bit gratified.`
`"......I see.`
` Since you're both the successor and Krauss's child, ......that makes Jessica your little sister."`
`He was so used to Jessica being an only child that, though the scuffle between the two looked perfectly natural,`
` something didn't feel quite right about it.`
`"Jessica.`
` Can't you talk a bit more like a little sister's supposed to?`
` And while we're at it, why not try talking more like a girl your age.`
` Also, how many times do I have to tell you to stop calling me "future heir"?"`
`"C‐cram it!`
` I'll live the way I want to!`
` I'd suffocate if I had to act all refined like you, {i:future heir}...!"`
`"Yeek!`
` Ouch!`
` Owowowowow!!`
` Stop it, don't pinch me!`
` This is sister bullying—`
`pervert—`
`stop it—`
`owow!"`
`"Jessica!`
` Why are you talking like that in front of a guest...?!`
` Do you want me to get Mother involved again?!"`
`".........Looks like those two are close, in their own special way."`
`"Well, Lion is a person of impeccable character, perfectly suited to being the next head.`
` ......I guess I understand how Jessica‐chan feels... Lion might be a bit {i:too} perfect sometimes."`
`"She gets compared to Lion no matter what she does.`
` So you think that made her rebel?"`
`"If Jessica‐chan had been born an only child, I'm sure she'd have become a composed, quiet young lady.`
` ......Ahaha, that's an interesting thought."`
`"Don't worry.`
` Only child or not, her personality wouldn't change a bit."`
`"George onii‐chan,`
` ......who's this?"`
`"This is the first time I've met you, correct?`
` But it sounds as though you know a lot about our family.`
` I'm George,`
` and this here is Maria.`
` Pleased to meet you."`
`"Call me Will.`
` I'm investigating {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I want you to tell me what you know."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}?! Uu!!`
` See?!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} exists!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`Though Maria had looked hostile towards this unfamiliar man,`
` as soon as she heard the name of the witch she loved pass his lips, her eyes began to sparkle.`
`"Hey, Maria‐chan.`
` You've got to greet our guest properly."`
`"Hello!`
` My name is Ushiromiya Maria, uu!`
` I'm glad to meet someone who knows {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Handshake, uu!"`
`"Nn."`
`Maria suddenly stuck out her small hand, and Will reached out for it reflexively.`
`As soon as he did, ......he felt a bright light seeping out from the gap between their hands.`
`The theatergoing power that {f:5:Bernkastel} had given him had affected Maria.`
`"{f:5:Beatrice} is the witch of Rokkenjima...!`
` She plays with me every time I come to Rokkenjima!`
` She's my best friend, and a fellow member of Mariage Sorcière! Uu!!"`
`The light grew brighter and brighter......`
`This time, he could feel himself being drawn into Maria's world...`
`I'm Ushiromiya Maria.`
` My mama is Rosa.`
` My papa......... I don't have a papa.`
`I think I remember Mama showing me a picture long ago and saying "this is your papa".`
`It was a picture of a man with a dark suntan, on a beach, wearing a swimsuit.`
`......Later on, when I learned what "Papa" meant,`
` I asked Mama to show me that picture again, but she said there wasn't any photo like that.`
`But there was.`
` I drew a picture of it and showed it to Mama.`
` When I did, she got really mad and said that photo didn't exist, or that, if it did, she had already thrown it away.`
`Ever since then,`
` ......she kept saying that I didn't have a papa.`
`"......Did you know?`
` People say you need a papa and a mama to have a baby, but that's a lie."`
`"The virgin birth..."`
`"‘Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son,`
` and they shall call his name Emmanuel.’`
` ......If I was a boy, that might have been my name."`
`"Book of Matthew, chapter 1, verse 20."`
`"No, verse 23.`
` Verse 20 is "But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream,`
` saying, Joseph, thou son of David,`
` fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife:`
` for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.""`
`"......So you think your father is the Holy Ghost."`
`"Everyone said that everyone has a papa.`
` They said it was strange to not have a papa, that I was weird, that they felt sorry for me."`
`"But when I asked Mama, she said I didn't have a papa, that he didn't exist.`
` She got mad and hit me even though all I did was ask.`
` So......I didn't really understand who gave birth to me."`
`"......I was...not right as a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, an immature and irregular creature.`
` I realized I was a strange, pitiful girl, different from everyone else."`
`"It doesn't matter who your parents are or what other people say.`
` You are who you are."`
`"It must have been hard to teach that to a young, immature girl.`
` My kindergarten teacher might have said that to me when I cried after being bullied.`
` ......But even those words of encouragement couldn't fill the blank space...`
`...no, the questions.`
` Nothing anyone said could answer the questions in my mind."`
`"And the Book is what gave you the answers?"`
`"A priest came to see us."`
`I think his sermon was part of a class to enrich our minds.`
`To most of us kids, it was no different from an ordinary fairy tale a teacher could have told us.`
` ......No, it was harder to understand, and I think that made us bored.`
`Then, at the end, the priest said something important.`
`"That God knows everything?"`
`"Yep.`
` So I asked him.`
` ......I only have a mama.`
` I don't have a papa.`
` Mama gave birth to me without a papa.`
` Is that strange and sad? ...I asked."`
`The priest taught me.`
`{n}He said there was nothing strange about a child having no papa.`
`After all, Jesus Christ was born of a virgin.`
`And the one who gave birth to him...`
`was the Blessed Virgin...{i:Maria}...?`
`I was surprised!`
`Maria, the name I was given, was the answer all along.`
`"I was so surprised, I asked the priest to say it again.`
` ......He said that the Virgin Maria gave birth to a baby by herself!`
` So, I asked him if that meant I could give birth to a baby all by myself too."`
`"And how'd he answer that?"`
`"He said the Virgin Maria was with child because of the Holy Ghost.`
` Book of Matthew, chapter 1, verse 20, last part.`
` "For that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost".`
` ......That surprised me again!`
` What do you think that means?!"`
`"......You interpreted this to mean that...`
`Ushiromiya Maria had no {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} father.`
` ......That your real father was the Holy Ghost."`
`Regardless of what the Bible actually meant,`
` ......the young, sad girl, who had lost her sense of identity because of her lack of a father,`
` had finally created a way to understand herself.`
`"Once I realized that, I knew why I was different from all the other kids!`
` The ones who made fun of me were all children of Joseph.`
` But I alone was different!`
` I wasn't worse than everyone else...!`
` I was a child of God, a child of the Holy Ghost!!`
` When I got back, I told Mama.`
` I had no papa after all.`
` Mama gave birth to me all on her own thanks to the power of God."`
`It was probably painful for Rosa whenever Maria asked about her father.`
`"Why do I have no papa, when everyone else has a papa and a mama?"`
`Every time she was asked this, Rosa flew into a rage and changed the subject.`
`......And now, somehow or other, Maria had independently found an explanation that satisfied her.`
`She had no papa;`
` she was the child of Mama and God.`
`It isn't too difficult to imagine that Rosa, after hearing the explanation the young girl had found in the Bible, might have gone along with it as though it were true......`
`"Beato said that the minimum number of people needed to create a world was two.`
` I thought she meant that you need two parents to create a child.`
` ......That was when I came to a new thought.`
` Beato may be a witch, but she's a witch born of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` Beato isn't a child of the Holy Ghost."`
`"But I'm different.`
` I was born from Mama alone.`
` I was born of the Holy Ghost!`
` .........Beato can't create a universe without me.`
` But I have...`
`‘{i:God with us}.’`
` I can make a universe all by myself, along with the Holy Ghost!"`
`"Beato called me the Witch of Origins.`
` And she also said that eventually, I might become a Creator, who can create anything alone.`
` All by myself, I can create something out of nothing!`
` Beato can take that and make it expand infinitely!`
` Ange was the witches' apostle, who would spread the word far and wide!"`
`"And that was Mariage Sorcière."`
`"There's a huge difference between one and infinity.`
` That's why Beato is so great.`
` But compared to the difference between something and nothing, one and infinity are both just "something".`
` I'm the child destined to become the best witch—no!`
` The greatest Creator in the world...!"`
`"Mariage Sorcière was the nest to warm up my egg!`
` I am Ushiromiya Maria!!`
` Maria, who stands by God's side!!"`
`......If we liken Maria's sense of identity to a universe,`
` ......then this endless stream of words coming from her might be like the Big Bang.`
`She spent so long tormented over how to interpret her lack of a father.`
` ......Then, by chance, she saw a line in the Bible that seemed to affirm her existence, and she finally formed an understanding of herself.`
`The sad girl, who had hated herself for being different from all of her classmates, finally found her own meaning.`
`At that moment, Maria's universe, which had once been nothingness, was born as a clump of ultra‐hot, ultra‐high‐pressured energy.`
`.........Then, later on, she went to Rokkenjima, met the Endless Witch who called herself {f:5:Beatrice},`
` ......and the clump of energy exploded in a Big Bang, giving birth to their joint system of magic.`
`......That was the universe known as Mariage Sorcière.`
`"...........................`
` ......We're jumping ahead a bit too fast.`
` Let's take things one at a time."`
`"Sure.`
` Where do you want to start?"`
`"After you decided that you were the child of the Holy Ghost, it's easy to imagine that you gradually became more and more interested in the occult.`
` .........And then what?`
` Once you reached that state, where did you meet {f:5:Beatrice}, and how did the two of you interact?"`
`"It really did happen all of a sudden, one day.`
` .........I had wanted to meet the witch called {f:5:Beatrice}, who lived on Rokkenjima.`
` As a fellow witch."`
`"At that time, you already thought that you were a witch?"`
`"I did.`
` I already knew more about the Bible and the occult than most adults.`
` So, even though I couldn't use magic, I believed that I was a witch.`
` ......Kihihi, it's a bit funny, isn't it?`
` That's why I'm only a witch apprentice."`
`"When did you meet {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"I don't really remember when.`
` But I do remember what it was like.`
` It was really, really sudden."`
`"............Huh?"`
`"So, you are.........Ushiromiya Maria, I presume?"`
`It was such a very, very...`
`...abrupt encounter.`
`I had just been drinking some milk tea, all alone in the rose garden arbor.`
` Mama said that she had to talk about something important with Uncle Krauss,`
` ......so she told me to go outside and play.`
`Suddenly, ......she was sitting right there.`
`{n}I didn't know anyone who spoke that way.`
`I quickly realized that she was someone I didn't know at all......`
`"......Who...are you?"`
`"You were the one who first said that you wished to see me.`
` Here I am, welcoming the witch who came to visit my island, and yet you ask my name?`
` *cackle*cackle*."`
`"..................`
` {f:5:Beat}...`
`...{f:5:rice}...`
`...?"`
`"Precisely.`
` I am {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"Yeah, that is pretty sudden."`
`"Yep. Really, really sudden.`
` .........Witches and spirits always exist right beside us.`
` They just choose not to show themselves.`
` And, when they do show themselves, ......it's always sudden, as though they've been there the whole time.`
` ......That's what I learned that day."`
`"And then, you and {f:5:Beatrice} became friends?"`
`"Yeah.`
` She stayed and chatted with me the whole time, until Mama was done with her business.`
` We talked about magic...and witches.`
` And about how I was a child of the Holy Ghost."`
`"......And what was your impression of {f:5:Beatrice} then?"`
`"I don't like saying it,`
` but I knew more than she did back then.`
` At first, I thought she wasn't a very good witch."`
`"......Well, that was just my conceit.`
` There are many different systems of magic.`
` Also, mine was based on self‐study.`
` I probably only viewed Beato that way because her system of magic was different from mine.`
` It wasn't long before I came to regret that and apologized."`
`"Apologized?`
` .........Did {f:5:Beatrice} do something to win your respect?`
` .........I see.`
` So, she showed you magic."`
`We moved to the beach and talked lots, sitting at a table under an umbrella.`
`"Very interesting.`
` ......Maria.`
` I see you have been quite diligent in your studies.`
` At your age, to be capable of teaching a thousand year old witch such as myself is truly an accomplishment worthy of admiration.`
` .........And what sort of magic can you use?"`
`"......Magic?"`
`"If you call yourself a witch, you must be able to show me some sort of magic, correct?"`
`I was stunned for a second.`
`{n}Of course, it should have been obvious.`
`I was a child of the Holy Ghost, and since I'd studied so much of the occult, I was also a witch, not a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` Until that day, I had been so sure of both of those things.`
`So, when I was asked what sort of magic I could use, it left me in a daze...`
`"When one knows of magic and can speak of it, they finally reach the rank of apprentice.`
` ......One is only a witch if they can put such knowledge into practice and use magic, correct?"`
`"......So, .........I'm not a witch yet......?"`
`"You have studied well.`
` And I can sense a very rare talent within you.`
` One day, you may become a witch so great that even I could not compare,`
` ......or perhaps even a Creator as you have told me.`
` However, you are still young and immature.`
` .........You are...yes.`
` You are an apprentice.`
` A witch apprentice, you might call it."`
`"So, does that mean you can use magic, Beato?"`
`"Of course.`
` I could not call myself a witch otherwise."`
`"Incredible......`
` ......Show me!`
` I wanna see your magic!!"`
`Until this day, Maria had never doubted the magic‐related concept that she was the child of the Holy Ghost.`
`......However, no one had ever proven to her that occult phenomena actually existed.`
`Maria could create a universe all by herself.`
` ......However, she wanted to share it with a second person, so that she could believe in it even more strongly.`
`"In the past, I could have drawn a rainbow in the sky,`
` transformed it into seven colors of candy, and eaten them at my leisure.`
` However, my power has weakened so much that I cannot even preserve my form as well as I would like."`
`"I just heard about that.`
` You can't use your full power because of the shrine."`
`"It will take quite some time before my power returns.`
` At this moment, I cannot turn rainbows to candy.`
` ......However, perhaps I can show you a bit of that power with some simpler magic."`
`"I wanna see...!`
` I wanna see your magic...!!"`
`"Very well.`
` However, I must ask you for your assistance.`
` As I have already told you,`
` no matter how pure your soul might be, all {y:0:Humans}{n:0:humans} are tainted and filled with the toxin that resists magic."`
`"Yeah, I remember.`
` You told me about the anti‐magic toxin.`
` It wasn't in any of the books I've read.`
` You must really be incredible to know so much."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} lifted up an empty teacup,`
` then turned it around in front of Maria to show that there weren't any tricks or strings.`
`"Right, the magic to make candy appear inside an overturned cup."`
`"How did you know?!`
` You're incredible, Will! You even know about witch magic!"`
`"............That's because......it's one of the most basic types of magic a witch can use."`
`"It was just a normal cup, without any tricks in it.`
` I wanted to see. I wanted to see true magic."`
`Maria had a desire.`
`She had a desire to discover the occult in others......to help her believe that there was an occult side to herself.`
`That was why she agreed to help {f:5:Beatrice} with her magic.`
`She didn't want her own toxin to ruin her chance of knowing the miracles of magic.`
`"Good.`
` ......Now, try looking inside that cup."`
`"............Ah.`
` ......There's candy.`
` ......There's candy...!!"`
`"As a gift to mark my meeting with a new witch, and as a sign of our friendship, I offer this to you."`
`This...was a true miracle of magic.`
`{n}For the first time, I felt shame and embarrassment at my conceit.`
`I could feel that sense of omnipotence disappear,`
` the idea that I was the child of the Holy Ghost and the most important and special person in the world.`
`......Instead of a child of the Holy Ghost who can't do anything,`
` I'd rather be a witch who can use magic...!`
`I, Ushiromiya Maria, wanted to become a witch...!!`
`{n}Starting off as a witch apprentice!!`
`Already, I was obsessed with Beato.`
`"I want to become a real witch too!`
` I want to be your disciple!!"`
`"How modest.`
` You already have an abundance of talent and diligence.`
` Also, though it may have been different when I was at my full power, I cannot take on a disciple in my current state."`
`"......So I can't become a witch's disciple......?"`
`"Mm.`
` You cannot become my disciple.`
` ......However, you can become my friend."`
`"Really...?!"`
`"Yes.`
` From this point forth, we shall be friends.`
` Let us continue to talk of the deep and profound world of witches."`
`"Uu!!!`
` Thank you, Beato!!`
` Can I eat this candy?!"`
`"No, let that be a souvenir.`
` Instead of eating it, keep it in that lovely bag of yours."`
`"Right.`
` I'll eat it at home...!!`
` Uu, uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Maria.`
` That candy was brought into being by magic.`
` Therefore, it is fragile.`
` If you deny my existence with that toxin of yours, it will melt and fade away."`
`"Uu......`
` No.`
` I don't want your precious magic to disappear."`
`"Then be sure that you do not forget your meeting with me.`
` ......And if you will keep some simple promises to me,`
` I will greet you the next time you come to this island."`
`"Uu! I'll keep them.`
` What are the promises?!"`
`"Well, to start...`
` Each time you arrive home, wash your hands.`
` Then, rinse out your mouth.`
` You must not complain about this, for it is an important part of a witch apprentice's training."`
`"I'll do it!`
` Every day, when I come home, I'll wash my hands!`
` I'll rinse out my mouth!`
` If I do that, will I see you again?!"`
`"I promise it.`
` If you keep your end of the promise,`
` your body will be cleansed, and I will regain even more of my magical power.`
` ......Then, the next time you come, I will show you magic of even greater splendor."`
`"Uu!`
` I'll keep my promise! No matter what!!`
` I'll do it!`
` I'll become your friend and a witch apprentice!"`
`"Your resolve is heartening, Ushiromiya Maria.`
` I hope that you will quickly grow to become a full witch and my close friend."`
`"I think that was the first time I met {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"And was that candy still there when you got home...?"`
`"Yep.`
` ......But I doubted a little, so it was half‐melted.`
` I regretted almost doubting her."`
`"If I had doubted her more, I'm sure the candy would have been completely gone.`
` I almost lost the proof of the magical miracle that had happened before my eyes."`
`"A hard piece of candy melted?"`
`"It wasn't hard, it was......caramel, I think.`
` It was half‐melted and squishy."`
`"About what time of the year did this happen?"`
`"I'm not too sure.`
` But I remember that the milk tea had ice in it.`
` ......Why does that matter?"`
`"Never mind.`
` ......Did you tell Rosa about your meeting with {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"Yep.`
` I told everyone about it at dinner that day.`
` Uncle Krauss laughed at me.`
` Then, Mama, who was sitting next to me, got mad and told me to stop talking about it.`
` ...Uu."`
`"Next to you...?`
` By your family's ranking system, your seat shouldn't be next to Rosa's."`
`"It wasn't a family conference.`
` It was when just Mama and I came to visit.`
` So, there was only Uncle Krauss's family, Mama, and me.`
` And we didn't leave gaps, so we weren't sitting in the same spots as a family conference."`
`"...........................`
` .........And Rosa was sitting in the seat next to you?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Why does that matter?"`
`".........It doesn't.`
` ......Have you ever met with {f:5:Beatrice} outside Rokkenjima?"`
`"No.`
` After all, Beato's body is fragile, so she can't go wherever she wants.`
` I told her she could just possess me if she wanted,`
` but she said that she couldn't leave the island."`
`"And after that, you met her every time you came to Rokkenjima."`
`"Yeah.`
` We became really good friends.`
` The more I talked to Beato, the more I realized what an amazing witch she was.`
` She showed me wonderful magic every time I saw her.`
` Then, she told me about a system of magic that was different from mine, and we both talked together about the mysteries of magic."`
`"I wanted to reach her level as soon as I could.`
` I wanted to become the kind of witch Beato was."`
`"Did you ever introduce {f:5:Beatrice} to your mother?"`
`"Nope.`
` She said Mama's toxin was too strong, so they couldn't meet each other yet.`
` ......Almost all adults are no good when it comes to the toxin.`
` They're all tainted.`
` Kihihihihi."`
`"Was anyone other than you able to see {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"They couldn't at first.`
` She said her magical power was weak, so her body would crumble if even a little bit of the toxin reached her.`
` ......But she gathered magical power bit by bit, and eventually, she could appear in front of other people who had small amounts of toxin."`
`"And who was that?"`
`"Hmmmmmmm......`
` ......There weren't many of them.`
` Just a few of the servants."`
`"Specifically?"`
`"All of the servants here today.`
` ......Uu?`
` But not Gohda‐san, I think."`
`"So, there were four of them: Genji, Shannon, Kanon, and Kumasawa."`
`"And Doctor Nanjo too."`
`Apparently, they would sometimes come to visit Maria and {f:5:Beatrice}'s witch tea parties.`
`Of course, it was only for small things, like bringing them extra tea.`
`However, they were certainly aware of {f:5:Beatrice}, and even talked with her.`
`"......How did the servants react to {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` She was a guest who shouldn't have existed.`
` Weren't they surprised?"`
`"No...`
` After all, {f:5:Beatrice} is the other master of the mansion."`
`She said that the servants treated {f:5:Beatrice} as an honored guest.`
`And, sometimes, they were permitted to witness the new miracle of magic along with Maria.`
`"So, on the Rokkenjima of 1986, the ones who could actually meet with {f:5:Beatrice} were...`
`you, Nanjo, and the four servants excluding Gohda, for a total of six?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Beato said that she'd need to store up much more magical power before she could appear in front of anyone else."`
`"So, she intended to show herself in front of more people sometime in the future?"`
`"Yep.`
` She said that the day she made all of the {y:0:Humans}{n:0:humans} acknowledge her would be the day of her resurrection."`
`"...................................."`
`Maria, the servants, and Nanjo had acknowledged her.`
`She had probably chosen those {y:0:Humans}{n:0:humans} whose anti‐magic toxin was weakest and appeared before them first.`
`{f:5:Beatrice}'s game must have been to steadily increase the number of {y:0:Humans}{n:0:humans} who could recognize her,`
` until she could make everyone on the island acknowledge her.`
`In that case, the last person for {f:5:Beatrice} to appear in front of...`
`would be Battler, the one said to have the strongest anti‐magical power.`
`......Does this mean {f:5:Beatrice} thought that Battler would be the hardest one to convince......?`
`It seems true that Battler was one of {f:5:Beatrice}'s goals.`
`......However, if we go with Battler's chessboard thinking...`
`...we might say that {f:5:Beatrice}, who wanted others to acknowledge her existence, was someone who could not exist {i:unless} she was acknowledged.`
`Battler reached this thought himself back in the first game.`
`Yes, there is something different about the {f:5:Beatrice} of 1986.`
`She's different from the Italian Beatrice or the Kuwadorian Beatrice, both of whom certainly did exist.`
`The {f:5:Beatrice} of 1986, the one whom we are so familiar with in a mysterious way, yet who has no existence.`
`What does it mean to "kill" the {f:5:Beatrice} who has no existence?`
`......The minimum number of people required to create a universe is two.`
`However, Maria had said that even a single person could give birth to a universe.`
`And yet, Maria had desired a second person.`
` A second person to nurture the world she had given birth to alone.`
`Because if it was born and not nurtured, it would die and disappear?`
`.........Let's replace the word "universe" with "{f:5:Beatrice}".`
`The minimum number of people required to create {f:5:Beatrice} is two.`
`However, even a single person could give birth to her.`
`And yet, that single person desired a second person.`
` A second person to acknowledge the {f:5:Beatrice} created by the first person.`
`That meeting with a second person is the scene that Maria has just described.`
`The single person who created {f:5:Beatrice} had looked for a second person to acknowledge {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`and selected Maria.`
`We don't need Furudo Erika's heartless reasoning to know that the tea cup magic was a sleight of hand.`
`Maria, believing in the story about the anti‐magic toxin, would close her eyes whenever magic happened.`
`Any sleight of hand would be possible while she had her eyes closed.`
`......The caramel Maria had been given as proof of her meeting with a witch had melted a little because Maria had doubted.`
`In a season where one was likely to put ice in their tea, it was only natural for a caramel left in a bag to melt.`
`Ushiromiya Maria, the girl who's too trusting and will accept a story easily.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} appeared first in front of this girl, who had, in the language of witches,`
` very little of the anti‐magic toxin......`
`If we liken the creation of {f:5:Beatrice} to the laying of an egg,`
` then when a single person creates her, it is no more than a delusion.`
` Like a chick inside the egg.`
`If, and only if, a second person acknowledges her, the shell cracks, and she appears.`
`{n}She only appears when a second person comes to warm the egg.`
`When Maria acknowledged {f:5:Beatrice}, she finally hatched, and the chick was born.`
`In that case, Mariage Sorcière, which nurtured {f:5:Beatrice} and her system of magic, was like a nest.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} had a dignified presence, called herself the witch of Rokkenjima, and claimed to have lived a thousand years.`
`......Thinking about the {f:5:Beatrice}s who appeared in the previous game, this sounds less like the chick Beato, and more like Beato the Elder.`
`So, does this mean that the meeting Maria has just spoken of marks the birth of Beato the Elder...?`
`The egg itself had already been created by "the first person".`
`During the time before the meeting with Maria, it matured fully inside its shell, becoming the "character" with the dignified presence of a thousand years.`
`Then, when Maria acknowledged it, it hatched,`
` .........and the witch of Rokkenjima finally gained a form.`
`Perhaps, ......that moment marks the birth of the {f:5:Beatrice} of 1986.`
`......The younger, chick Beato was born out of love for Battler.`
`Since that birth has not yet occurred at this point in time,`
` then the birth of Beato the Elder and the existence of {f:5:Beatrice} at this time must have nothing to do with Battler.`
`..............................`
`Are you enjoying this reasoning,`
` {f:5:Bernkastel}......?`
`If you are, let's at least have some applause from the audience.`
`............Great, thanks a bunch.`
`"I have a lot of things I want to ask Beato to grant for me with magic.`
` So, I'm helping Beato with her resurrection."`
`"......What kinds of things?"`
`"Lots and lots.`
` Kihihihihihi. Not telling."`
`"You want to protect your mama from the black witch, right?"`
`"How do you know so much?`
` You're incredible. Uu!"`
`"......And your happy world will never return without a witch's help...`
` That's what you...think now?"`
`"Yep.`
` I love Mama.`
` She's so nice.`
` I want to be with her forever.`
` For all eternity."`
`"...........................`
` ......Now I'd like to hear about Mariage Sorcière."`
`"................................."`
`"...............`
` ......What's wrong?"`
`"Don't wanna."`
`"............Huh?"`
`"I'm thirsty, so I'm gonna go get something to drink.`
` See you later."`
`Maria suddenly started acting distant, bowed her head, and left without waiting for a reply.`
`......It was a very un‐Maria‐like thing to do.`
`"................................."`
`I see.`
` So, the Game Master has moved the piece.`
`......Apparently, she's telling me to ask about something different for now.`
`At some point, Lion had started chatting with the other family members.`
`Jessica seemed to be getting irritated at having her butt pinched so much, and George was trying to calm her down.`
`......Jessica and George.`
` Guess I'll hear their stories next.`
`Compared to Maria, the anti‐magic toxin is very strong in these two.`
`At least at the beginning of the other games, they didn't acknowledge {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`Maria showed me the point of view of one who believes.`
`{n}Now to hear from those who don't.`
