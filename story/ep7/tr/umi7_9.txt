`".........Let it be heard.`
` I am one yet many.`
` What I speak is our tale.`
` However, this is a small world, sealed by glass and cork, with no one to hear.`
` None shall lay eyes upon it, and my entire tale shall be sealed away,`
` set adrift in the sea of my heart until it disappears along with the seaweed......"`
`"Ah, where is this place?!`
` And who am I?!"`
`"Then let me ask!`
` Where would you like it to be? Who do you want to be?!"`
`"Any place, so long as it will blanket me gently!`
` Anyone, so long as I am treated kindly!"`
`"Yes, for us—"`
`"For us—"`
`""Where and who we are hardly matters!!""`
`"Indeed,`
` to us, that is a very insignificant thing.`
` At least, until that day comes to pass.`
` Why must we be cast into a new fate?`
` The pronouncement of Fate arrives sudden and abrupt."`
`"It is not the fate I wished for."`
`"But it did make the heart pound...!"`
`"Where will the new fate take us?!"`
`"It doesn't matter where!"`
`""So long as that place is kind to us...!!""`
`"The tidings brought to the temporary dwelling where unfortunate children without mother or father gather—`
`do they herald God's salvation, or does the Devil beckon us to be the playthings of a new fate?`
` We have no means of knowing."`
`"And yet, we want to believe.`
` We want to believe that it is gospel, good tidings, salvation offered us by God."`
`"But why would I be chosen?`
` I have no religious beliefs!"`
`"Then this is not gospel; the Devil beckons!"`
`"And yet we have not the means to resist fate.`
` Oh, I am one yet many.`
` I pray that the new fate brings us blessings.`
` The time is April of 1976.`
` A month too cold to speak of spring.`
` There is no change in the strange new land, which ever plagues us with its stale air and ceaseless breezes......"`
`"Those are all of the family rules.`
` They may be strict, but I believe that the discipline you learn in this house will serve you well in the future."`
`"""Yes, Madam."""`
`The servants who would start working this April all called out in unison.`
`The rules of the Ushiromiya family are no more or less strict than those at the Gospel House.`
`However, here, we get paid a lot of money.`
`{n}They also give us a lot of help in finding our next job.`
`We work for the Ushiromiya family, store up money, use their influence to get a job at a good company, and start on a new, happy life.`
`......That was the dream, and it was a very realistic one, held by all of us at the Gospel House.`
`However, not everyone can become an Ushiromiya family servant.`
`{n}Only kids with a record of exemplary conduct and good grades are recommended.`
`So, all of the kids who want to be sure of leaving the Gospel House to live a happy life are feverishly devoted to their studies......`
`"That's enough for today.`
` Tomorrow, you start early.`
` Make sure the lights are all out at the appropriate time.`
` That is all."`
`"""Yes, Madam.`
` Thank you very much."""`
`After bowing until Natsuhi was no longer in sight,`
` the new servants all followed the lead of one of the more experienced servants and raised their heads.`
`"Okay, we're done for the day.`
` Starting tomorrow, you'll be following your shift schedule.`
` Madam is very strict about time.`
` If any of you sleep in, it'll be my responsibility.`
` So if you do, I'll kick you awake.`
` Got it?!"`
`Of course, this experienced servant was one of the older girls from the Gospel House.`
`{n}She's been here for two years, apparently.`
`That's probably why all the other new servants, who are older than me, seem to know her well.`
`They all chatted noisily, saying things like "Madam looks so strict" and "Dang, I'm tired."`
`"......By the way, just who is this?`
` Who chose this kid to be a servant?"`
`The older servant pointed at me and asked the room at large, a dubious look on her face.`
`It's no surprise, really.`
` Most of us become servants when we graduate middle school or high school.`
`But I'm just starting elementary school.`
`The others will be working as servants every day, according to their shifts.`
`However, I was going to go to the elementary school on Niijima with Milady,`
` only working on the weekends and when I had free time.`
`It was an exception among exceptions, something that had never happened before.`
`......It was clear at a glance that the others, who had obtained their positions after a rigorous selection process,`
` didn't like the fact that I was here too.`
`"......Both Madam and Genji‐sama have told me that you are to put your studies first.`
` But you're still getting paid.`
` Doesn't make any sense."`
`If you're going to talk behind someone's back, at least do it behind them.`
` ......She didn't even try to hide her discontent.`
`"Is this kid really that smart?`
` A child prodigy, or something?"`
`"Beats the heck out of me."`
`"I didn't know this kid at all back in the House. They kept this one separate, apparently, something to do with a weak constitution."`
`"......Now that you're here, you're part of the collective responsibility system.`
` If you screw up, it's the same as everyone from the Gospel House screwing up.`
` Make sure you don't, okay?"`
`I nodded weakly.`
` ......I'd never been threatened by someone this much older than me, and I was very frightened.`
`"Don't worry.`
` I'll help you through.`
` Let's give it our all together,`
` okay?"`
`Shannon smiled at me as she spoke...`
`"Don't you find it scary, Shannon?`
` This house looks pretty strict...!"`
`"No, there's nothing scary about it.`
` It's only scary to you because that's what you think."`
`"Then if I think it's fun, will it be fun?!"`
`"Yes, it will.`
` So just like before, let's put on a smile and give it our all."`
`"......Shannon was my only friend in the Gospel House.`
` She was confident and popular.`
` The complete opposite of me.`
` I was embarrassingly dull‐witted, and no one wanted to be my friend."`
`"I would never have made it through those days in the Gospel House had it not been for her encouragement.`
` ......So, I would probably make it through here too, with her by my side."`
`"Well, isn't it about time we got ready for bed?`
` I've got work early tomorrow morning, but you have a different job."`
`"That's right. Unlike everyone else, I have to go to school.`
` When I spend the night on Rokkenjima, I have to get ready for school and wait for Milady at the dock."`
`"Milady looks like an energetic person.`
` I hope you get along well!"`
`"D‐do you think I will...?`
` I'm scared of school, nervous...!"`
`"......I had grown used to life in the Gospel House, so the more relaxed rules at school made life easy.`
` But until I grew used to it, everything was new, and everything made me nervous."`
`My new life on Rokkenjima probably deserves an explanation.`
`It was completely different from the comfortable yet stagnant life I'd lived at the Gospel House.`
`In addition to the time I spent as a servant to the Ushiromiya family on Rokkenjima, I also traveled to the elementary school on Niijima on school days.`
`It was the start of a time that was both rushed and busy, with hardly any time to relax.`
`Unlike at the Gospel House, I didn't get to sleep in the same bed every day here.`
`Half of the week, I slept in the servants' quarters in the Rokkenjima mansion.`
`I would return from school with Milady, go to the mansion, and work there as a servant.`
` I would then stay the night and head to school with Milady again the next morning.`
`On days when I didn't have work, I would return to the dormitory on Niijima, where I could have some time to myself in the room that had been assigned to me.`
`There was an adult dorm mother who strictly controlled mealtimes and lights‐out,`
` but I was already used to that sort of life from the Gospel House, so it wasn't hard for me.`
`The rooms were slightly larger than average and housed three people each.`
`However, either because of the number of people or some lucky chance, I was not given a three‐person room.`
`"Looks like we'll share a room back here in the dorms too."`
`With Shannon by my side, I felt like I'd be able to manage well enough...`
`"Correct.`
` Every year, new servants came from the Gospel House, replacing some of the old ones."`
`"It was something Father organized with them all on his own.`
` The rest of us weren't allowed to meddle."`
`"Our family provided a strict upbringing for these children without relatives and supported them on their path to adulthood.`
` I always viewed this as the wealthy Ushiromiya family's obligation to society."`
`"What sort of kids came to serve the Ushiromiya family?"`
`"I'm sure they were diligent,`
` lovable kids of irreproachable conduct!"`
`"It seemed to me that there were a lot of glaring hyenas among them."`
`"Let us say they had high ambitions.`
` Those poor children without relatives.`
` They were determined to use this rare opportunity to launch their careers, so that they could take control of their lives."`
`"Did all of them have to balance school and servant work?"`
`"That must be tough!`
` You wouldn't be able to get much work done!"`
`"There has been no case of a servant going to school while they worked...except for that child."`
`"To be honest, I was fairly surprised when that child first came to greet me.`
` So obviously young.`
` The others were all around 16 or 18 years old, but that child looked almost ten years younger."`
`"The young servants who come from the Gospel House visit only to gain experience in working in the real world,`
` so I do not expect a high level of skill from them as servants."`
`"Very true.`
` You can't rely on them to the same degree as an adult, seasoned servant."`
`"But this was a child who hadn't even started school.`
` No knowledge of housework, no practical experience, and yet to begin compulsory education.`
` I don't know what Father was thinking, but I always thought there was something clearly odd about it."`
`"I spoke to Father about it.`
` I asked if it might be better to wait for our servants to graduate middle school before having them serve here."`
`"And what did Kinzo say?"`
`"Come on, we all know what he said."`
`""Oooooh, {f:5:Beatrice}~~!!""`
`"Hahaha...`
` By that time, he was already a complete shut‐in inside his study, obsessed with the occult.`
` If you tried to talk to him, he'd yell and tell you to stop interrupting "the journey of his mind"."`
`"And Father's decisions are absolute.`
` ......However, the case with this particular child just didn't make sense."`
`"I even asked the Gospel House about it.`
` They said to ask Genji‐san.`
` I then asked Genji‐san, and he said to ask the Master."`
`"And then you asked the Master, and he said "{f:5:Beatrice}~"!"`
`"Ahahahaha!`
` No one knows the truth!"`
`"Jessica was the only child on the island.`
` The servants would often play with my daughter, but she wanted a friend of her own age.`
` Someone she could play with at home, as well as at school."`
`"......I began to think that Father had employed this servant out of pity for Jessica.`
` ......But if that were the case, why wouldn't he talk to us about it beforehand?`
` We should be the ones to decide which friends are suitable for our daughter."`
`"Scaaaryyy! Ahahahahaha!"`
`"Natsuhi wouldn't cope well with taking her kid to the playground!"`
`"We should probably view this as an arrangement planned by Genji."`
`".........Yes, probably.`
` ......Genji‐san knew that the "me" in this other world carried Grandfather's blood,`
` so he must have made special arrangements for that "me" to be brought to Rokkenjima."`
`"Are you feeling okay now?"`
`"......It was a really big shock, that's all.`
` ......I just feel a bit dizzy now."`
`"In the world we're in now, you're the successor.`
` But if your world had been different, you could have been a servant......or maybe a witch.`
` ......You do have a troubled fate."`
`"Seriously......`
` I don't regret learning about it, but if I could forget it now, I would."`
`"*giggle*, isn't it interesting?`
` Even though you're a servant, you're actually an illegitimate child of the head......`
` Isn't that romantic, like some fairy tale?"`
`"......Romantic?`
` ......Considering how Mother must feel, I'm not sure about that."`
`"Eheheh, true.`
` In Natsuhi's eyes, the Lion of this world is nothing more than the detestable baby she was ordered to raise.`
` And this is also a world in which she refused that order."`
`"......Natsuhi's natural child, Jessica, is hundreds of times more precious to her.`
` A baby that doesn't share your blood is nothing more than a dirty, lukewarm sack of filth."`
`"Have some decency.`
` Next time, I'll be the one pinching your butt."`
`"......Thank you, Will.`
` ......I think I understand, more or less.`
` This makes it all the more important for me to be grateful to Mother.`
` She's raised me fairly all these years."`
`"Though at a probability so low it'd take a miracle to happen.`
` ......You know, animals are always brutal towards children that don't carry their blood.`
` Lions do that too, don't they? ......*giggle*giggle*."`
`"Genji's thinking must have gone something like this.`
` ......‘This is a true member of the Ushiromiya bloodline.`
` I want this child to live on Rokkenjima if at all possible.’`
` However, he couldn't suddenly bring Lion over and tell everyone everything."`
`"......I agree.`
` Maybe he intended to have me live on the island until it became normal, and then reveal everything when the chance presented itself."`
`"However, the Lion of this world was not given special treatment.`
` Notably, the silver ring doesn't exist."`
`"I wonder if that means Grandfather never heard about me."`
`"It might mean that Genji never found a good opportunity...`
`to reveal the truth..."`
`"Genji must have wanted...`
`to someday tell Kinzo the truth that the child of his beloved Beatrice was still alive.`
` However, revealing this truth would not be so easy."`
`"I wonder why it isn't easy?!"`
`"You dummy, what would happen if Natsuhi found out?!"`
`"Oh, right, if Lion suddenly appeared, Jessica wouldn't be the successor anymore!"`
`Strictly speaking, Jessica wasn't the successor to the headship, but since she'd be able to select the successor, it all came to the same thing.`
`"It is a tale that becomes less simple the more one learns of it.`
` Some would celebrate my birth; others would not.`
` ......Genji could only wait in silence for the day of revelation to come."`
`"Was it a tale hidden only within Genji's heart?"`
`"Lion and Kinzo and Natsuhi and Krauss and Jessica and everyone else!`
` None of them knew of this tale!"`
`"Thus, the curtains slowly rise on this curious tale in the year 1976.`
` Oh, I am one yet many.`
` Why must fate proceed so selfishly and freely, leaving us behind......?"`
`People only found the young servant strange for the first month.`
`Natsuhi and Krauss's protests came to naught.`
`After all, there was no harm in it.`
`So why not indulge Kinzo's whim...?`
`Eventually, everyone grew accustomed and began to accept this slightly abnormal everyday life.`
`"However, it was not so for the other servants of the Gospel House, who were always close by and who believed that everyone should be treated equally.`
` As time went on, their little grievances about my special treatment began to accumulate......"`
`"Good job, Sawachi.`
` How'd it go today?"`
`"Madam was in a real shitty mood.`
` She literally ran her finger across the windowsills!"`
`"Tadacchi got chewed out for cleaning too slow.`
` Like, what does she want from us?!"`
`The Gospel House treats all the children under its care as family.`
`Because of this, their original names are not spoken there, and everyone uses new "blessed names" instead.`
`Maybe because the "{ruby:in/on/non/ne:{p:0:音}}" character is in the word "Gospel" ({ruby:Fukuin:{p:0:福音}}),`
` that character is almost always combined with at least one character from the child's original name to make their new name.`
`......Still, just giving a person a new name doesn't mean they'll accept it so easily.`
`The boys and girls of the Gospel House, living without relatives due to all kinds of circumstances,`
` often feel as though their real first and last names are a bond that's worth holding onto.`
`So, many of the Gospel children hate their "{p:0:音}" names and call each other by nicknames based on their original names.`
`Of course, this is only privately.`
` When in the presence of the House Director or other important people, only the blessed names are used.`
`On the job, the blessed names are used.`
` And off the job, the informal nicknames are used.`
`Everyone is very used to living with two names like this, so they're all naturals at switching between the two.`
`"Whoo, you stink.`
` Go take a shower."`
`"Dang, why's it so cramped in here?`
` Can't they get a bigger dorm if they have that huge mansion?"`
`"Hey, Garashi‐sa~n.`
` Why's Yasu the only one who isn't in a three‐person room?"`
`By "Yasu", they probably mean me.`
`I can't remember my parents at all, ......but I was given the family name "Yasuda".`
`And, apparently, my nickname comes from that.`
`"How should I know? Genji‐sama's the one who decides the rooms.`
` I don't like it either."`
`"Yes, seriously!`
` Wouldn't you normally split it two and two?!"`
`"What's the deal with Yasu anyway?"`
`"It's like that kid's job is going to school with Milady or something.`
` ......A school friend position?`
` Doesn't make any sense."`
`......Of course, on days when I am given work,`
` I return to the mansion right after school and work alongside all the others.`
`I help out with caring for the garden and cleaning up the mansion.`
`{n}I can't do any jobs on my own, so I'm always just helping out.`
`......Maybe because I'm young, the adult servants are always kind to me.`
`It seems my fellow Gospel House servants are annoyed by this.`
`"Don't you think Kumasawa‐san's being blatantly soft on Yasu?`
` It's like she's mistaken Yasu for her own grandchild or something!"`
`"And why on Earth does that kid get paid the same as the rest of us?`
` I don't get it!"`
`".........I realize that you have school to worry about,`
` but don't forget that you're a servant too, okay?`
` You need to stop being a helper and learn to do work by yourself like the rest of us.`
` We aren't going to let you have things easy forever, okay?"`
`..............................`
`I have been trying my best.`
`However, I'm not very strong yet, so I can't carry heavy things.`
` I can't carry a lot of things at once, either.`
`I can't fold clothes right, and I'm not good at using a dustpan.`
`I just can't do it as well as everyone else......`
`As my face turned red,`
` ......I spotted Shannon, who was watching from the sidelines and not joining in.`
`......Shannon is my only ally.`
`{n}Unlike me, she can do everything well.`
`However, she'll never pamper me.`
`She'll show me how things are done, but she'll never steal my jobs from me.`
`She really is incredible.`
`I really want to be like Shannon, as soon as I can.`
`......She never talks behind people's backs, and no one talks behind her back.`
` She's kind, and she gets along with everyone.`
`I want to be like her.`
` And she's always kindly watching over my efforts to become like her.`
`"......Why......did I end up here?"`
`"I don't know."`
`Though I'd just been muttering to the ceiling,`
` Shannon gave me an honest answer.`
`"I guess there's no way to say it except that it's part of God's plan."`
`"Is this another test from God...?"`
`"Yep.`
` Think of it as a test to help you grow into a wonderful person.`
` After all, you're a special, chosen person."`
`"......Am I...`
`...special?"`
`"Of course you are.`
` After all, everyone else here is big, but you were the only one special enough to be chosen young."`
`"Why am I the only one who's little?`
` I can't do any jobs by myself."`
`Everyone complains that I'm just there to play with Milady.`
`And yet, Madam made it clear that I'm not to think of Milady as a friend and speak to her in a casual manner.`
`"You may be ten years younger than everyone else,`
` but that means, if you keep it up until you're the same age as the others,`
` you'll be much more experienced than the new people who come later.`
` Even Genji‐sama will acknowledge your talents, and you'll become a leader who can teach the new kids who come from the Gospel House."`
`"And then, I'm sure that everyone will respect you.`
` By that time, even Madam, the Master, and Krauss‐sama will acknowledge your skills.`
` That's your future."`
`"......You mean like the ugly duckling becoming a swan?"`
`"That might be it.`
` After all, it was very unusual for you to be chosen as an Ushiromiya family servant.`
` ......In fact, that rumor might be true,`
` and you might be the secret child of someone in the Ushiromiya family.`
` *giggle*."`
`Shannon laughed, saying "wouldn't that be cool" and "then you'd be super‐rich too".`
`But I felt a bit doubtful.`
`After all, ......if that was the case, why did I have to live all alone in the Gospel House?`
`Shannon and people like the House Director were the only ones who would play with me.`
`I wasn't allowed to play with any other friends, ......and I spent all my time by myself, in my isolated room.`
`Maybe it's because I'm frail and always half‐asleep, .........but it has been lonely.`
`"Hey, Genji!`
` How much of this did you know?"`
`"You never talk about anything, but you've known everything since the beginning, haven't you?"`
`"...................................."`
`"19 years ago,`
` you heard from Natsuhi that a servant had fallen from a cliff holding a baby."`
`"You went to the bottom of that cliff and realized that the baby was still alive, didn't you?"`
`".........The question of whether it was alive or dead...`
`was not one that I was qualified to answer."`
`"Then who was?"`
`"The doctor, of course!"`
`""What do you say, Doctor Nanjo?!!""`
`"..................`
` ......Perhaps it is fitting.`
` ...Shall I speak?"`
`"......If you would be willing,`
` ......then I ask it of you."`
`"..................`
` Very well."`
`......I was contacted by Genji‐san immediately after the accident, and I was asked to conduct an examination in secrecy.`
`"In secrecy?"`
`"Why?"`
`"......Both the Beatrice of Kuwadorian and her child were unregistered people who weren't supposed to exist.`
` It would lead to various problems if it went public..."`
`"I had started the procedures to have the baby registered, but they were not complete at that time.`
` ......It was a very bad time for the baby to "die"."`
`"So, the servant who fell was treated as the only death?"`
`"Natsuhi wouldn't talk to anyone.`
` It would've been easy to set up!"`
`"But that baby was alive, wasn't it?"`
`"Correct.`
` ......Of course, the child was gravely injured.`
` It was a miracle that it survived those injuries.`
` If some angle had been slightly different,`
` or if Genji‐san had been any slower in bringing the baby to me...`
` ......That baby only managed to survive thanks to a series of miracles."`
`".........I had given up.`
` I didn't believe the baby could survive."`
`"But it did."`
`"How strong and resilient is life!"`
`"No, this is fate."`
`"Fate!`
` So the baby was fated to live on and eventually accomplish something great?!"`
`"..................`
` ......Yes,`
` I did think that it was fate.`
` I thought the blood of the Kuwadorian Beatrice‐sama, whose life ended on Rokkenjima,`
` must have imparted something onto this child to make it survive."`
`"However, Genji did not tell his master, Kinzo, that the child had survived.`
` He simply said that it had fallen to its death in an unfortunate accident.`
` Kinzo mourned, but his mourning was more one of madness than of sorrow......"`
`"Ooh, {f:5:Beatrice}, why have you run away from me once more?!"`
`"Why, even though I swore I'd never make the same mistake again, why?!!"`
`"There was one matter for which Genji did not trust the master he so respected.`
` That matter was whether Kinzo would be capable of accepting Beatrice's grandchild as family."`
`"Genji had served the Kuwadorian Beatrice for many years as well.`
` He was very aware of what she had felt.`
` He knew that she accepted Kinzo's affection and respected him as her father."`
`"However, her love was not the same as Kinzo's love.`
` Kinzo thought her to be Beatrice reborn,`
` and tried to use her to satisfy the many feelings he had felt for the late Beatrice.`
` Of course, the Kuwadorian Beatrice could not accept those feelings.`
` In the end, Kinzo himself, the one she respected and thought of as her father...`
`stole away her chastity......"`
`"She thought he was her father, and he thought she was his wife!"`
`"Oh, what unmanageable, forbidden love!"`
`".........I do understand Kinzo‐sama's feelings to some degree.`
` It is not as though Kinzo‐sama saw the late Beatrice‐sama in the girl at the time of her birth,`
` nor did he decide at that moment to make her his plaything."`
`"He......spoke to me about it a few times when we were drinking.`
` I always thought he was just joking."`
`"As she grew up, was he surprised to find that she looked more and more like her mother?"`
`"As she became older, did he suffer from a forbidden emotion he could not suppress?"`
`"......I thought that the tragedy...`
`...might repeat itself.`
` ......That was my view."`
`"................................."`
`"Beatrice‐sama suffered much.`
` And ultimately, she never truly understood the difference between her feelings and Kinzo‐sama's.`
` .........I spoke with Beatrice‐sama many times, listening to her deepest feelings.`
` However, I could not bring myself to tell her the truth."`
`"That would be hard to say!"`
`"Imagine telling her that the one she respects as her father wants to use her as a replacement for her dead mother!"`
`"......Let me say this for the sake of Kinzo‐san's honor.`
` He also suffered greatly.`
` It pained him when he found that he could no longer think of his daughter as a daughter.`
` ......I told him to love her as a father.`
` I think Kinzo‐san listened to reason and his conscience and fought for some time..."`
`"Kinzo loved her.`
` He poured his affection onto the daughter that Beatrice had left behind.`
` He did so as a father.`
` And yet, if so, why did he give the daughter the same name as the mother?"`
`"Yes, Kinzo's sin started from the moment she received life.`
` Beatrice gave birth to her and died as if in exchange.`
` ......He passed the name down from mother to daughter.`
` From the moment of her birth, Kinzo had already decided that she was Beatrice reborn..."`
`"Lion, in other words,`
` is what happens when Kinzo, trying to atone for his sin,`
` succeeds in bringing the child into the Ushiromiya family officially."`
`"......Exactly.`
` I get the feeling I'll get my butt pinched if I talk about other fragments,`
` ......but maybe there's one where Lion is accepted...`
`...and Kinzo commits a tragedy,`
` who knows...?`
` ......Wanna see if we can find it?`
` *giggle*giggle*........."`
`"Who would want to see something like that?`
` .........Is it your job to mix together the worst imaginable possibilities for every part of a person's life and laugh at their horrible fate?!"`
`"Unfortunately, that's the sort of demon she is."`
`"{i:Witch}, thank you.`
` *giggle*......"`
`"......Genji foresaw that worst of all possible futures, and, trying to secure a better future, he intentionally lied about the baby being dead."`
`"Right.`
` Kinzo was a man of such burning desire that he took advantage of his own daughter.`
` Genji, who knew Beatrice's feelings and felt sympathy for her, couldn't trust Kinzo so easily."`
`"Even Genji, Kinzo's most devoted servant?"`
`"Genji is a man who can draw a clear line between the professional and the personal.`
` While he served Kinzo faithfully, he also felt that the mistake Kinzo had made with his daughter was not one to be forgiven easily."`
`"......Probably.`
` And to make sure that Lion wouldn't be found out easily, Genji lied about the kid's age, lowering it by three years."`
`"You're right.`
` In this world, I'm just entering elementary school in 1976.`
` I was actually supposed to become a fourth year then."`
`"If your frailness wasn't the reason, .........then Genji must have been careful to disguise the year of your birth.`
` The "baby from 19 years ago" was unforgettable not just to Kinzo, but to Natsuhi as well.`
` If a suspiciously young servant of that age came to the island, Natsuhi's feminine intuition would definitely have picked up on it."`
`Had the child been too sick to go to school for three years?`
` Or had the age been faked, so that Natsuhi wouldn't figure everything out?`
`"Either way, we know that your age has been lowered by three in this world."`
`".........Correct.`
` The age of this world's Lion has been altered by three.`
` ......This is a small, feeble kid we're talking about.`
