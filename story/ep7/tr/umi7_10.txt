`"Yasu.`
` What'd you do with the small broom?"`
`"......Didn't you use it to clean the window frames?"`
`Ah, ............`
`The small broom is a small, thin broom that looks like a large paintbrush.`
`We use it to clear out the dust in small corners, like window frames.`
`It's one of the cleaning tools I was put in charge of...`
`"Come on, that was your responsibility, right?!`
` What're you doing, stupid?!"`
`"Quickly, go and find it...`
` You have to do it before Madam finds out..."`
`"What's up?"`
`"Yasu lost the small broom again.`
` Is this kid some sort of genius at losing things?!"`
`"That's why I'm always telling you, never give things to Yasu.`
` Yasu's always careless and losing things."`
`"Don't say that, can't you see this kid's working hard...?`
` Come on, quickly.`
` I'll wait for you."`
`O‐okay......`
`Not wanting to hear the servants complain even more, I spun around and headed off.`
`If you lose a tool, you get in trouble.`
` If no one knows who did it, we all get yelled at,`
` so one of them will probably tell Madam that it was my fault.`
`Still, it's my fault that I lost it in the first place.`
`I wonder when I lost it.`
`{n}When, when......`
`We did a big clean of the entire chapel today.`
`The chapel is a large building behind the mansion.`
` However, no one ever goes near it, normally.`
`Even so, we're ordered to clean the chapel a few times each year.`
`Kinzo calls it a sacred building, so Natsuhi is very strict about it......`
`We cleaned every little nook and cranny, from top to bottom.`
`It took all day.`
`I'd been put in charge of cleaning the window frames, but I was also given many smaller tasks.`
`While those small jobs kept me busy, I must have completely forgotten about the small broom...`
`...and left it lying around somewhere.`
`......I hate myself for doing this.`
`{n}This isn't the first time this has happened.`
`It happens all the time.`
`Every time I set something down, it always disappears.`
`{n}It goes somewhere else. Vanishes.`
`I've come to think that these might be pranks by the witch {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`The ghost of the witch {f:5:Beatrice} borrowed the power of Rokkenjima's evil spirits to become reborn.`
`Until Kumasawa‐san told me, I never knew the meaning of the shrine on the rocks by the sea.........`
`"Kumasawa told an old, old tale, passed down among the local fishermen.`
` Rokkenjima used to be known as Akujikijima,`
` and terrible evil spirits who ate human souls lived there......"`
`"Hey, Kumasawa!`
` Let us hear too!"`
`"Tell us the scary, scary tale of Rokkenjima's evil spirits!"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, very well, very well.`
` Rokkenjima used to be called Azukijima.`
` However, even deeper in the distant past, it was known as Akujikijima.`
` It was rumored that sailors who got too near the island were dragged down to the bottom of the sea and had their souls eaten."`
`"......Those frightening spirits do exist on this island, you know?`
` Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho."`
`"It was Kumasawa's favorite ghost story.`
` Every new servant who came to the island heard about it.`
` .........Normally, such a story would be laughed away; however, on Rokkenjima, an island home to nothing but the Rokkenjima mansion,`
` which rumbled with eerie thunder on stormy nights, people listened to the story with unusual respect."`
`"So the shrine by the coast is there to seal evil spirits away!"`
`"And the Master has that weird occult hobby, too!"`
`"And the mansion is so creepy, something must be lurking around somewhere!"`
`"Hoh‐hohoho.`
` True, true.`
` Sealing up the spirits was all that the traveling ascetic could manage.`
` The seal just manages to hold them, but to this very day, they wander through the mansion, night after night, searching for a victim.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho......"`
`"Have you seen the Master's study?!"`
`"I have!`
` It's like some kind of demon laboratory!"`
`"There's that rumor about the Master researching demons!"`
`"They also say he's researching how to revive his mistress, Beatrice!"`
`"Didn't they say he was gathering children to be sacrifices for his magic experiments?!"`
`"Waah, scary!`
` What will I do if the Master asks me to come into the study alone?!"`
`"I heard that, long ago, one kid went into the study and never came out!"`
`"She must have been a victim of an experiment to give Beatrice's ghost a new body!"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` Yes, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama has become a ghost, and wanders around searching for a body.`
` The VIP room on the second floor is where {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama dwells...`
` You must always be respectful when cleaning that room...`
` Otherwise...`
`.........uhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hhi{0}hhi~!"`
`"In the eyes of those teenage boys and girls with their fertile imaginations, the ghost story was both terrifying and fascinating.`
` By experiencing and sharing in a story together, a kind of solidarity forms.`
` Then, sharing in that experience becomes obligatory,`
` and accepting the story becomes a rite of passage for joining the group.`
` That process was an old one that had repeated many times as the story was passed down."`
`"That's right.`
` Back when I first started work at Rokkenjima,`
` I heard that story from Kumasawa‐san and the older servants."`
`"I heard about it too, mostly from Nee‐san."`
`"I heard it too.`
` From Kumasawa‐san, mainly."`
`"So, not only the timid‐looking Shannon,`
` but a boy, Kanon, and a big adult, Gohda, believed in the ghost story?"`
`"Well, I didn't really {i:believe}..."`
`"There are tales of ghost stories and jinxes in all jobs.`
` There were several stories of the sort at the hotel I once worked at."`
`"So, you thought it was stupid, and you didn't pay it any mind?"`
`"......I think there was a need to blend with the community."`
`"That's it.`
` Ghost stories and jinxes are all the local rules of your workplace.`
` If a newcomer turns his nose up at them, he can't expect to blend in."`
`"Exactly.`
` ......If I said witches couldn't exist, that it was ridiculous, then I'd get into a fight with Nee‐san.`
` It was easier if I just appeared to go along with it."`
`"Come on. If you look at it that way, you'll be cursed...`
` There was one servant who got seriously injured..."`
`"Hahaha, all workplaces have stories like that.`
` No matter how incredible the ghost stories or the tales about the company founder are, you accept and believe them.`
` That's what it means to blend in with your new workplace."`
`""Wow!`
` Everyone's so mature!""`
`I went to each window around the chapel in the order I had cleaned them, searching carefully in all the places I might have left it.`
`I had been cleaning the windows with it, so I'd probably set it down near one of those.`
`......When did I leave it behind, I wonder?`
`Now that I think about it, I don't think I had it anymore when I reached the last window,`
` so I must have completely forgotten to clean that window frame.`
`"..................Ah."`
`Through the window, I could see the others leaving in groups.`
`{n}Shannon turned around and glanced up in my direction, looking worried.`
`......I don't want to be responsible for making everyone wait, so it's actually a relief that they're leaving without me...`
`Still, ......naive though it may have been, I wanted them to wait......`
`The sun's beginning to set, and the chapel's getting darker and darker.`
`{n}I don't want to hang around in a place like this all by myself.`
`I'd better find the small broom fast.`
`No, that's not all.`
` I also need to clean the window frames I forgot.`
`Madam is strict.`
` She'll probably check all of the windows carefully.`
`If she does, I'll be the one that gets in trouble tomorrow.`
`But really, where did I lose it?`
` Why did I lose it?`
`The darkness grew and grew.`
`......When it became dark enough that I would need a light before long, I began to panic.`
`I dashed around and around the chapel, tears streaming down my face...`
`As I stumbled about pathetically,`
` I could feel the presence of a prankster witch, giggling at me from under the door and up by the ceiling.`
`The ghost of {f:5:Beatrice}, the Master's mistress, wanders about in search of a body to this very day.`
`As she gains the power of Rokkenjima's evil spirits, her strength steadily grows, and she waits for the day of her resurrection.`
`And, ......for some reason, she's singled me out,`
` and if I ever take my eyes off something for a second, she snatches it away and hides it.`
`This isn't the first time this has happened.`
`Whenever I look away, .........keys, handkerchiefs, pencils, erasers...`
`all of them vanish almost right away.`
`I put things down planning to use them later, or because that's obviously the right place to leave them,`
` and still they disappear as soon as I turn around.`
`It isn't someone hiding them as a prank.`
`{n}It's happened many times when I'm the only person around.`
`......Everyone always says I'm too careless and forgetful, and they laugh at me, get mad at me.`
`I do try to be alert,`
` but like some kind of bad joke, I lose things easily when I forget about them for just a short while.`
`So, sometimes, I think "I bet this eraser is going to disappear just like everything else", and I stare at it.`
` That's the only time when it doesn't disappear.`
` Nothing disappears when I'm alert.`
`So then I think I'm safe, but the moment I start to think that and relax just a little bit, a {i:different} thing will disappear instead...!`
` Why is it always me......?!`
`{a:c:`
`*giggle*giggle*,`
` ......ehehehehahahaha......}`
`......Yeah, I hear it.`
`I can hear that witch laughing at me as I lamely run around in circles...`
`{a:c:`
`*giggle*giggle*,`
` ......ehehehehahahaha......`
`Ahahahahahahahahahaha......}`
`Listening to that voiceless laugh, I finally slammed my hands against the wall, crying tears of frustration.`
`"Please, just stop it...!!`
` Why do you always hide my things and get me in trouble?!"`
`The witch answers.`
`Fool.`
` ......Isn't it obvious?`
`Why else, except to entertain myself by watching you wander about pointlessly?`
` *cackle*cackle*, hyah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}hah{0}hah{0}ha...!!`
`I felt so frustrated.`
` I knew all along that that was the reason, but the witch being so blatant about it was incredibly annoying.`
`I can tell.`
` That small broom {i:is} somewhere in this chapel.`
`No, that's not quite it.`
` Until the very moment I walked up to this window, I'm sure it was right by this window frame.`
`That's right, I'm sure I put it right here by this window.`
`But the prankster witch {f:5:Beatrice} uses her magic,`
` and just before I reach this spot, she instantly teleports the small broom to the next window over.`
`The instant I approach the next window,`
` a hole appears beneath the small broom, swallowing it up.`
`And it comes out by the next window after that.`
`It lands right there, perfectly still, as though it was there the whole time.`
`And this happens over and over again!`
`As I run up to one window, the small broom falls into a magic hole and goes to the next window.`
` And when I go to that window, it goes to the next window...!`
`That's exactly how she's teasing me, I can tell!`
`So no matter how much I search, it'll be useless.`
`But if I stop searching, it'll be just sitting there by one window or another.`
`So, this isn't a search.`
` It's a test of endurance.`
`I keep chasing after the small broom,`
` and {f:5:Beatrice} keeps making it escape to the next window over, trying to make me give up.`
`This is an eternal chase...that'll end only when one of us gives up...!`
`So, I keep going around in circles searching the windows, even when I know I've already searched them.`
`If it's not by this one, then the next one, and the next one.`
`And the witch keeps moving the small broom to the next window, and the next one...!`
`"Just give it a rest...!!`
` How long are you going to make fun of me?`
` This isn't the only time, you always do this, always!!"`
`{a:c:`
`*giggle*,`
` heh`
`heh`
`hah`
`ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha}...!!`
`The shrill, voiceless{FIXME?} laugh of the formless witch continues to mock my sobbing.`
`The witch is right beside me, laughing at me.`
`As I dash around the chapel, she's following along with me, taunting me.`
`Then...`
`she must be...`
`there.`
`She's right behind me, ......just over my shoulder,`
` cackling away at this very moment.`
`I know that turning around won't help, since she has no form.`
`{n}I can try to look, but I mustn't look with my eyes.`
`Once my eyes tell me there's nothing there, I won't be able to {i:{y:1:‘see’}{n:1:"see"}} anymore.`
`I learned that from the Director of the Gospel House.`
` ......You mustn't try to {y:1:see}{n:1:look} with your real eyes.`
` ......You must {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:{i:see}} with your {i:mind's} eye.`
`The whole world is filled with God's love.`
` In the many blessings of everyday life, one can find God, and angels, and the Holy Ghost.`
`{y:1:If you try to look at them with your eyes, you won't be able to see them {i:or} ‘see’ them.}{n:1:If you look with your eyes, you won't be able to see them.}`
` So you won't be able to feel them or understand them.`
`Instead, you must quietly understand them with the eye of your heart.`
`You don't look and have your eyes reflect their image.`
`{n}You {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:"see"}...{0}and picture them in your mind.`
`In this way, I learned how to recognize beings not of this world at the Gospel House.`
`......This power doesn't only allow you to {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:"see"} God.`
`{n}It allows you to {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:"see"} {i:all} those not of this world.`
`".........Please, stop it now.`
` Stop this prank."`
`"...............Hoh.`
` ......So, you can speak to me?"`
`"I'm clumsy, bad at my job, ......and I do forget where I put things a lot.`
` ......But I know which things were my fault, and which things were because of your pranks."`
`"How amusing...`
` Not only can you perceive me in my formless state, but you even understand my little game.`
` .........It seems you are a more interesting creature than I thought,`
` Yasu."`
`......I'm usually called Yasu when one of the older servants is laughing behind my back at some mistake I've made.`
`So, when I hear that name, it feels bad.`
`She deliberately called me not by the blessed name given to me by the Gospel House, but by that unblessed name.`
`Upsetting the heart is a classic move for evil beings to make.`
`{n}That is their way of attempting to prevent others from perceiving them.`
`To beings like witches, being understood is like shoving them out into the light of day.`
`"......It won't work.`
` In the Gospel House, I learned how to perceive those not of this world.`
` So, I already understand you."`
`"Very interesting.`
` ............I am a being so faint that I would scatter in a gentle breeze, yet you hold me in the grasp of your perception.`
` ......I have taken a liking to you, {i:Yasu}!"`
`"It won't work.`
` I understand you now, and you're in my grasp.`
` No matter how many unpleasant things you say, you'll just expose the ugliness of your heart."`
`Without turning around, ......I slowly let my field of vision fill the entire chapel.`
`It was as though the viewpoint of my soul was floating out from the shell of my head.`
`......See,`
` ............inch by inch,`
` ......my field of vision is floating out of my head...`
`...and drifting upwards.`
`As I looked down at myself, standing there with head hanging and eyes tightly shut...`
`...my mind's eye...`
`...very slowly...`
`......rose up to the ceiling of the chapel.`
`And when I looked down from there...`
`...I looked down at myself, standing in the center of the chapel, .........and the witch standing behind me.`
`......Apparently, the witch realized that she was being {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}.`
`She turned around...`
`......and raised her eyes to look at my mind's eye, floating by the ceiling...`
`......At last,`
` I could {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} the witch {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`...with my mind's eye......`
`"A mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}...`
`...grasped my form......?"`
`The demonic lips......twisted in an ugly curve.`
`{n}It was clearly a challenging, repulsive, ......demon's smile...`
`She wore a blood‐red dress and hat.`
` The design was completely different from anything {y:0:Humans}{n:0:humans} wore.`
`Her hair was blonde.`
` It had countless beautiful curls, like a princess from a picture book,`
` ......but there was no trace of cuteness about her.`
`"......I thought you were a little different from the other {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s,`
` but it seems I was mistaken."`
`"........................"`
`"You are not just a little different......you are {i:entirely} different from other {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"You sad witch, who can be seen by no one, heard by no one.`
` ......Have you been pulling these pranks all the time just to catch the attention of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s...?"`
`"I use what little magic I have to interfere when {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s aren't looking, but no matter what I do, none of them think of it as magic.`
` ......They decide that they just made a little mistake,`
` and blow my existence away like the candles on a cake."`
`"If so, then I've just saved you.`
` Because I understand you...and perceive you."`
`"......Saved me?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` To me, this meeting with you is nothing more than a new way to kill time."`
`"It's getting dark.`
` I don't have the time to play with you anymore."`
`"Well, well, so it is.`
` My apologies. When one is engrossed, one hardly notices the time."`
`".........Please give it back.`
` My cleaning tool."`
`"That small broom, or whatever you call it?`
` It's right there, by the next window."`
`"But as soon as I get close, you'll move it to the next window over."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` My magic is as elusive as my very own form.`
` With no more than a snap of my fingers, everything here is under my total control...!"`
`The witch snapped her fingers, and various things throughout the chapel were sucked into black pitfalls beneath them, disappearing.`
`No, they didn't disappear.`
` The instant they vanished into the dark holes, other dark holes appeared in completely different parts of the chapel, and the vanished objects fell out of those.`
`Chairs, musical scores, clocks, and vases started appearing and disappearing all across the room.`
`I felt as though countless tools were flying about the chapel......`
`"I can perform these acts, but I choose not to.`
` After all, this would be a bit more than a prank, don't you agree...?"`
`I wonder where a witch draws the line between pranks and magic.`
`When she snapped her fingers again, all of the objects flying about so energetically returned to their original spots,`
` and silence fell.`
`"I've taken a liking to you.`
` ......You say you have me in your grasp?`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` That works in reverse.`
` I have you in mine."`
`".............................."`
`The Gospel Director told me that I mustn't try to {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:"see"} evil beings.`
`If you {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:"see"} them, they will haunt you.`
`Now that I understood this witch, a bond had been formed between us.`
`"That is correct.`
` Now that you have acknowledged my existence, I have formed a bond with you.`
` ......After all the years I have spent in boredom, it will be nice to have someone to talk to, even a child as young as you."`
`"I'll talk to you from time to time.`
` So, will you stop pulling pranks like this?"`
`"No, I won't be here to talk to you, but to play with you!`
` *cackle*cackle*. And if we're playing, pranks are just part of the game, right?"`
`"................................."`
`"Heheh.`
` ......Very well.`
` I've had enough fun for one day.`
` The sun has sunk and the moon is full.`
` I am tired after appearing in front of you for so long.`
` Let us call it a night.`
` That single broom provided me a great deal of entertainment...!"`
`"Please, give it back."`
`"No.`
` I will keep this as a token of our meeting.`
` I assume that you will be fine with this?"`
`"......If I said I'm not, would you give it back to me?"`
`"I never listen to {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s!`
` .........However, I might lend an ear to a friend."`
`"......If you give it back, ......I'll acknowledge you as a friend."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!`
` Foolish {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, was that your idea of an attractive proposal...?!`
` ......If you want to make a deal with me, try drawing a mysterious magic circle or two!`
` .........And yet, I might be willing to consider your offer."`
`"What do you mean, you might...?"`
`"I shall take my time in deciding whether you are worthy to be my friend.`
` ......After all, witches are like demons!`
` If you ask us for an answer, we will never give one right away.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`".........Alright.`
` Then, .........I'll leave the small broom with you.`
` Please give it back when you decide to become my friend."`
`"Very well.`
` Will this broom become a bridge of friendship between us, or not?`
` ......I will hang onto it for now, making my decision in my own good time."`
`When the witch snapped her fingers, the broom for which I had searched so long fell out of a hole in the air,`
` landing between the fingers she had just snapped...`
`"This is goodbye.`
` ......This game with you was far from boring.`
` Let us play again sometime."`
`"If you're my friend, that is."`
`"When a cat toys with a mouse, does it try to become friends with it first?`
` *cackle*cackle*, ahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa!!"`
`The witch faded away......`
`{n}As she did, my mind's eye slowly closed......`
`When I returned to my body, I felt suddenly tired and let out the breath I'd been holding.`
`......Of course, when I turned around, there was no one to be seen.`
`I couldn't feel the witch's presence anywhere anymore.`
`{n}It had gotten very dark by this time.`
`I decided to leave the chapel.`
`{n}There's no point in searching for the small broom any longer.`
`......Not until the witch decides to give it back.`
`I went out of the chapel.`
`The chapel key had been left in the lock.`
`{n}I used it to lock the door.`
`............What am I going to do about the small broom?`
`There's nothing I can do.`
` I can't even blame the witch.`
`I must acknowledge that I'm responsible for giving the witch a chance...`
`"..............................nn—"`
`I happened to glance downwards......and saw a small broom lying there by my feet.`
`It was the broom I had been searching for all this time.`
`......Don't tell me...`
`that it'll be swallowed up by a dark hole the instant I bend over to pick it up...?`
`No.`
` This is...a sign from the witch.`
`A sign that she acknowledges me as a friend.`
`I picked it up.`
`Oh, I am one yet many.`
`"The first friend I made after coming to the island was apparently not a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} at all.`
` However, when I think back on it, it was only natural.`
` What other sort of friend would you expect to make on a witch's island?`
` This was the first meeting between me and {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......However, as the more perceptive among you may have noticed, this was not a meeting with the real {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` The witch I then called {f:5:Beatrice} would later be known by another name."`
`"......However, the fact remains that she was clearly not human.`
` And being bonded with one who is not human means being bonded with their world.`
` I still had no means of knowing the strange fate that awaited me on Rokkenjima......"`
