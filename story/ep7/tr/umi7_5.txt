`"Lieutenant Yamamoto.`
` The Italians don't want us to tell the mainland about this gold."`
`".........Aha.`
` So, they don't want our country to take possession of it."`
`"<What did he say?>"`
`"<He's saying your group probably doesn't want it reported because you fear that Japan will take possession of the gold.>"`
`"<Ensign Angelo is actually more afraid of Italy itself finding out.`
` To us, our homeland's current government is a mere puppet set up by the Allied Forces.`
` If they find out, the gold will be returned to them.`
` However, that would be the same as handing the gold over to our enemies.>"`
`They had come all this way to make sure that the gold didn't fall into enemy hands.`
`They needed to hide this gold from the puppet government...`
`...until their homeland could be truly restored...`
`"Ushiromiya.`
` Make a proposal to the Italians.`
` Tell them that we wish to offer our assistance."`
`"What sort of assistance...?"`
`"I understand what the Italians are trying to say.`
` They want that gold to be hidden so that their homeland doesn't find out about it.`
` However, they would need to obtain at least a transport ship if they plan to take it from this island.`
` If they tried that, however, the mainland would hear about it, which means that the Italian government would too."`
`"That's right.`
` ......In other words, there's no longer any way to take that gold off Rokkenjima."`
`Their mission must have been to hide that gold in absolute secrecy until the day of their homeland's restoration.`
`Later on, several plausible rumors would circulate...`
`about how Germany also moved much of its secret wealth to certain hidden areas in South America just prior to its surrender.`
` It was a very natural conclusion to reach.`
`That submarine was their only method of transporting the gold in secrecy, and it's become completely useless.`
` They can't fully stop the water from seeping in, and it'll probably sink completely before much longer.`
`There's no longer any way for them to transport the gold in secrecy.`
`In other words, their mission has ended in failure here in the Far East.`
`So, just how is Lieutenant Yamamoto proposing that we assist them......?`
`"The Rokkenjima base is top‐secret, and no one knows about it.`
` The islanders in the surrounding area believe this island to be ill‐omened and deserted, so they never come near it.`
` ......Do you get my meaning, Ushiromiya?"`
`"<What did he say?>"`
`"<As we told you earlier, no one knows about this base.`
` And, as you can see, it's of no use strategically, so the higher‐ups have already forgotten about it.`
` ......Sounds like Lieutenant Yamamoto's suggesting that you hide the gold on this island.>"`
`Beatrice quickly translated this and told Ensign Angelo.`
`The ensign began discussing rapidly with his subordinates.`
`They didn't look happy.`
`Japan may have been their ally, but they probably didn't want the gold for reconstructing their motherland to be entrusted to Asians.`
`Still, it's hard to imagine any other option for them.`
`"<......It's a fierce debate.`
` Some say that there's no other option, while others think we should remain loyal to our homeland no matter the cost.`
` ......Ensign Angelo is stuck between a rock and a hard place.>"`
`Hiding this gold was the final order given to them by their fallen homeland.`
`{n}However, by now, there was no way for that order to be carried out successfully.`
`If the mainland or their own homeland found out, the gold would probably be confiscated by the wrong people, from their point of view.`
`If they really wanted to carry out their homeland's orders faithfully,`
` .........Lieutenant Yamamoto's proposal was extremely reasonable...`
`Though the lieutenant couldn't understand their words, it seemed he realized how divided they were.`
`"Heheheh, if we help out, we'll be able to hide the gold in the utmost secrecy.`
` Fortunately, there's an abandoned tunnel that stretches all the way across this island."`
`"<......He's saying that, if you hide the gold underground and bury it on this island, no one will be able to find it.>"`
`"<Our side is saying that it sounds like a realistic proposal.`
` ......However, there seems to be some resistance against accepting Japanese assistance.>"`
`"......It seems they're having difficulty coming to a decision."`
`"Heheh.`
` Do you really have a choice, Italians?`
` You don't think you can hide that gold without our help, do you?`
` And I doubt you want to leave it lying around on the beach for much longer."`
`"<Ensign Angelo wants to minimize the number of people who know about the gold.`
` ......He doesn't trust the Japanese, but it looks like he's decided that Lieutenant Yamamoto's plan is the best possible option.`
` But...he seems suspicious.>"`
`"<About what?>"`
`"<He's wondering whether they really intend to move a full ten tons of gold and swear themselves to secrecy...without any sort of compensation......>"`
`"Fifty‐fifty."`
`"......Sir, you can't be—"`
`"Hand over half of the gold to us.`
` With that as our work wages, we'll hide the other half nice and safe for them."`
`"<......H‐he's telling you to give us half of it.>"`
`The instant Beatrice translated that sentence, Ensign Angelo slammed his hands on the desk and stood up.`
`Instead of flinching, Lieutenant Yamamoto, true to his boasts of once being a thug that everyone feared,`
` actually looked even more relaxed and confident than he had previously.`
`"After all, they really don't have the option of refusing.`
` I could demand eighty percent if I wanted.`
` I've lowered that to an even split as a sign of good faith."`
`"......Of course, we aren't the only ones with leverage here.`
` If the Italians decide to leak this to the outside, all of the gold will probably be taken by Japan or Italy.`
` We won't get even a single yen out of it.`
` This can only work if we're both partners in crime here."`
`"<He's saying we should all be partners in the crime of embezzlement.`
` ......By now, he's already moved on to speaking as an individual, not as a soldier...>"`
`"<Insane......`
` So, he's been blinded by greed...>"`
`Lieutenant Yamamoto was grinning.`
`It really did look as though he had been blinded by greed, just as Beatrice said...`
`"If they leave it just piled up where it is, you can be sure that it'll be noticed when the boat comes for them from the mainland.`
` If that happens, none of us will profit.`
` They ought to accept our proposal and hide the gold as soon as possible."`
`"<......It sounds like Ensign Angelo is dead set on the Japanese and Italian governments not finding out about this.`
` He wants to carry out his duty until the end.>"`
`"<So, what exactly does that mean?>"`
`"<He wants the gold buried deep within the island, even if he has to pay some percentage to buy your silence.`
` ......Of course, some of his subordinates object strongly.`
` They're saying that fifty percent is out of the question.>"`
`"Ushiromiya.`
` How is it going over?"`
`".........They also don't want any more people laying eyes on the gold.`
` ......However, they seem to object to the portions."`
`"<Ensign Angelo says that they'll consider 10%.`
` ......Though he's also saying that he's fairly sure Lieutenant Yamamoto won't accept that.>"`
`"Ushiromiya.`
` What is the Italians' answer?"`
`"......They'll consider handing over ten percent."`
`This time, it was Lieutenant Yamamoto who slammed down on the desk.`
`But the Italians didn't flinch either.`
`......An incredible tension filled the small room...`
`However, despite his violent outburst a second ago, Lieutenant Yamamoto's expression still looked smug and in control.`
`He was probably confident that he now had the initiative.`
`"Ten percent!`
` Now there's a modest proposal.`
` ......Very well, I'll give up ten percent.`
` Forty‐sixty.`
` Tell them I won't go any further than that!"`
`Forty percent for the Japanese.`
` Sixty for the Italians.`
`The lieutenant made it sound like he was willing to stand firm on that, but in truth, these negotiations were not being made on an equal footing.`
`If the Italians just wanted the gold for themselves, there wouldn't be much of a problem.`
`But what if...`
`what if they really were true patriots, ......and decided that they ought to return the gold,`
` even to the defeated puppet government of their homeland, for the purpose of reconstruction?`
`If so, they would probably report the existence of the gold to the Italian embassy.`
`Eventually, the Italian government would petition the Allied nations for the retrieval of their gold.`
`......It probably wouldn't all make it back to Italy, but it might be used effectively to repair and rebuild the battered towns.`
`If that happened, Lieutenant Yamamoto and his friends would only be able to sneak out a few ingots at most.`
`He was greedily planning to make this his own treasure island, so that he and his subordinates could have an enormous fortune all to themselves.`
`......If he wanted those ambitions to bear out, the Italians would have to conceal the presence of the gold.`
`"<But there's one thing I don't get.`
` .........If Ensign Angelo doesn't want to let anyone have the gold, he could have just let the submarine sink.`
` Why did he have it unloaded?>"`
`"<......I'd rather not think about it,`
` ......but Ensign Angelo might have started planning to embezzle the gold as soon as he found out that their mission would be impossible to complete.`
` Right now, he's asking his subordinates for their opinions both as soldiers...`
`and as individuals with families waiting for them back home.`
` ......The more straight‐laced soldiers are furious.>"`
`The discussion between the Italians was becoming fierce and emotional.`
`Though their homeland had fallen, they had come all this way in accordance with its orders.`
`They had probably been given this mission because they were particularly faithful and duty‐minded troops.`
`It seemed they couldn't just agree to a foreigner's proposal to embezzle and split up the gold......`
`Ensign Angelo looked like he was doing all he could to calm the unexpectedly fervent rage of his subordinates.`
`......Looks like the gold is blinding them too.`
`It seems no one can sort out their own personal feelings and the way they want to be perceived......`
`"How's their answer coming?!`
` Ushiromiya!!"`
`"<......Bice.`
` Lieutenant Yamamoto's asking for an answer.>"`
`"<.........They're saying they want some time to think.`
` I had you to talk to, so I could let off some tension, but that wasn't true for the rest of them.>"`
`"<......They lost a lot of comrades at the end of a very long journey, and now they're here in a tight spot.`
` They've even lost their mission, the one thing they could depend upon to guide them.`
` They don't know what to do...>"`
`"Sir.`
` ......They say they'd like some time."`
`"Heheh, sure, let 'em talk it over all they want.`
` But there isn't much time.`
` If we're going to hide it, that'll take time and effort.`
` ......Make your decision before noon tomorrow.`
` That's all, Italians!"`
`"<......He's giving you until noon tomorrow.`
` ......That bastard, it's like he's trying to threaten you.>"`
`"<Ensign Angelo is saying he'll ask everyone's opinions...>"`
`"<How does it look?>"`
`"<It'll probably be tough going.`
` ......It seems the ensign is willing to consider splitting it,`
` but his subordinates and the others will probably oppose that.`
` ......All of them have lost close friends on their voyage to the Far East.`
` They're firm in their desire to do their duty for our homeland.>"`
`"<......Will they refuse the lieutenant's proposal?>"`
`"<Even if they do, the gold will just fall into someone else's hands.`
` ......If nothing is going to be left anyway, Ensign Angelo suggests that they each sneak at least one ingot back with them, and some of the others seem to agree, but......`
` Men always get carried away at times like this.`
` Even I can't guess what they'll do...>"`
`"......I imagine the Italians had some complicated feelings about all this."`
`"In their eyes, Italy after the surrender was probably like an enemy country.`
` Letting the gold go back to that Italy would erase the meaning of their entire voyage."`
`"However,`
` embezzling and splitting the gold would also erase the meaning of their journey..."`
`"The country they felt obligated to serve had already fallen.`
` That alone destroyed the significance of their journey.`
` Not a happy story for them."`
`"......If it's bound to be meaningless anyway,`
` wouldn't keeping hold of even just a few ingots be better than nothing?"`
`"Sure, if you want to calculate straight‐up profit and loss.`
` ............But men aren't like that."`
`The Italians were gathered in a cramped room, arguing fiercely.`
`«I don't like it!`
` We must remain true to our soldier spirit until the end, for the sake of our fallen comrades!»`
`«And how do you define "remaining true"?`
` By hiding the gold on this island?`
` By accepting the proposal of those Asians?!»`
`«We can't trust them!`
` Especially that Yamamoto person!`
` We must not let our guards down!»`
`«Unloading the gold and letting the Japanese see it was a huge mistake!`
` We should have let it sink with the sub!»`
`«Oh, wonderful idea, let's just sink it right inside a Japanese base!`
` It would have been pulled up eventually.`
` That wouldn't hide anything!»`
`«There's no way to get the gold off this island without anyone knowing in any case.»`
`«If we had just taken the honorable path and scuttled the sub, none of this would have happened...!!»`
`«If we had known back then that the sub was already broken beyond repair......»`
`«Why did you ask the Japanese military for help, Ensign?`
` How were you planning to carry out the mission if they found out about the gold?»`
`«Our mission was a failure from the moment you asked them for help!»`
`«All of us have families waiting for us back home.`
` And we've more than done our part, I'd say, voyaging all the way to this island country in the Far East.`
` You could call this a fair and just payment for our services.»`
`«*chatter*chatter*!`
` *chatter*chatter*chatter*!!»`
`«Ensign Angelo.`
` ......If the Japanese prove to be less than amicable, we need to be prepared to take extreme measures.»`
`«......And what do you mean by extreme measures, Corporal?»`
`Someone gulped.`
`A stiff tension hung over the room...`
`«The Japanese here are pushovers.`
` They're all cowards with no battle experience.»`
`«And we are elites.`
` We know the layout of almost the entire base, along with the number of Japanese troops and how they are arranged.`
` If Ensign Angelo gives the order, we should be able to subdue them quickly.»`
`«Only a few of them, Yamamoto included, look like fighters.`
` The rest are just laborers attached to the military.`
` It may look like they have the advantage of numbers, but we have the greater military force.»`
`«If we kill the Japanese, how are we going to explain it when the boat comes for us?`
` You really think that'll work?!»`
`«There should be plenty of ways, as long as the corpses aren't found.»`
`«Ensign Angelo.`
` ......It will be easy to subdue this base.`
` If we kill Yamamoto and the few strong fighters, the laborers will probably surrender easily.»`
`«Let's have them carry the gold and bury it.`
` ......Of course, we'll have to silence them afterwards.»`
`«Are you suggesting we massacre all of them......?»`
`«Let's do it.`
` If we kill them all, no one will have to know about the gold.»`
`At that moment, the door, which had supposedly been locked, opened slightly, and a metal object was thrown in.`
`{a:c:`
`{e:120:«{ruby:Grenade:Granata}!!!»}}`
`As the yell rang out, the table was kicked over to be used as a shield, and they all dropped to the floor.`
`However, in this cramped room, it probably wouldn't do them any good.`
` The Italians were all prepared for death.`
`«...............?»`
`«A dud! It's a dud!!»`
`Fortunately, the shoddy grenade was a dud.`
`The door was slammed open, and three Japanese soldiers wielding pistols jumped in.`
`"Dammit, it's a dud!!`
` Kill the Italians, kill the Italians!!"`
`«Return fire!! Fire at will!!»`
`In this small room, no matter who shot where, it was bound to hit someone.`
`The exchange of bullets instantly caused a rain of blood, with casualties on both sides.`
`The three who had jumped in were covered with bullet holes and fell over, moaning and thrashing...`
`«Gggghgggghghgh...`
`gghh...`
`.........!`
` *cough*...`
`*cough*......»`
`«Gino!! Gino!!`
` Damn, they got his lung, we can't save him!!»`
`«We should consider ourselves lucky!`
` If that grenade had gone off, we'd all be dead!»`
`The grenade was still rolling about on the floor...`
`It had been a surprise attack.`
` ......Lieutenant Yamamoto had probably judged that the negotiations would not go his way and had decided to make the first move.`
`Or else, maybe he had been planning from the beginning to put them in the position of having to take a vote...`
`in order to gather them all in one place.`
`Rokkenjima belonged to the Japanese.`
` If they killed all of the Italians, then not half, but all of the gold would go to them.`
`There was still a chance the grenade might go off late.`
`{n}The Italians rushed out into the corridor.`
`They heard gunfire from down the hallway.`
` It was coming from the direction of the submarine dock.`
` Clearly, the troops guarding the pile of gold were being attacked.`
`«Ensign Angelo!! What are your orders?!!»`
`«We have no choice!!`
` Kill the Japanese!!»`
`"L‐Lieutenant!`
` These guys are good.`
` Those Italians aren't your ordinary sailors!"`
`"Heheh, I see, they needed men good enough to guard that gold.`
` We have the numbers.`
` Keep your cool, surround them, and kill them!! Let's hunt some Italians!!"`
`As soon as I heard the sound of repeated gunfire, I knew.`
`I knew that whatever it was that had been smoldering since the time the gold was unloaded......had finally burst into flame.`
`The eyes of our soldiers when looking at the gold had not been normal.`
` Yes, those eyes had been entranced by demons.`
`The Italians had also been at breaking point due to the heavy burden they bore.`
`Who wouldn't have snapped after becoming trapped in a distant land where you can't understand the language or the writing?`
`Thinking I had to do something, I ran towards the sound of gunfire.`
`......Looking back on it, that was an extremely foolish thing to do.`
`That sound meant that there were people shooting at each other.`
` People killing each other.`
`And yet, unarmed as I was, I dashed towards the sound, as though I was trying to mediate some schoolyard fight.`
` ......It didn't take long before I learned how foolish and naive such a thing was in the heat of battle.`
`"......H‐Hiraoka?!"`
`Warrant Officer Hiraoka was lying face down, his entire body drenched in blood.`
`Judging by the trail of blood behind him, it was clear that he had somehow managed to crawl here from a different room before dying.`
`No, he was still twitching.`
` He might not be dead yet.`
`......But, on this island without a doctor—`
`no, even if we had a doctor...`
`how could anyone possibly...`
`...save a man who had been shot this many times in the chest...`
`When I looked into the room he must have crawled out of,`
` I saw two more blood‐stained Japanese corpses.`
`"Ah, aaah......aaaah......`
` Th‐......they're d......"`
`I fell backwards pathetically on my butt, my mouth hanging open in shock......`
`......Come to think of it, that was the first time I had ever faced death in my life.`
`The entire world was at war.`
` Even though millions were dying both East and West,`
` ......this was the first time I met with a person's death directly.`
`Ridiculous.`
` ......Didn't I join the army hoping to die?`
`Didn't I whine about not being sent to the front lines?`
`Yeah, so rejoice, Kinzo.`
` Isn't this the death you were looking for...?!`
`Why not spread your hands and yell out loud?`
` "Come for me, magnificent death!!"`
`Someone came running towards me.`
` It was a colleague of mine, a Japanese man. Tajima‐kun.`
`"R‐ru—ru—r—...!!"`
`He dashed towards me, pale‐faced and out of breath.`
`His face seemed horribly contorted with terror.`
` Mine probably looked the same.`
`"Tajima‐kun... Wh‐what happened......?"`
`"R‐run away...`
` W‐we'll...we'll all be killed!!"`
`Someone yelled in Italian, and at the same time, Tajima‐kun let out a scream...`
`Then, he grabbed onto me as he fell to the floor.`
`A red stain was spreading across his back before my eyes...`
`"Tajima‐ku...n......"`
`"R‐`
`......run...`
`......`
`*cough*...`
`......"`
`As he spat bubbles of blood, .........he said that one word......and died.`
`But the shocking event of seeing someone die right in front of me did not capture my attention.`
`......No living thing is concerned with the deaths of others at a fundamental level.`
` The one thing that matters is whether they themselves die or not.`
`My attention was fully occupied by the barrel of the gun the Italian soldier was pointing......`
`Tajima‐kun's back burst once more as he leaned against me.`
` Flesh tore, blood splattered.`
` The warm splash of it covered my face.`
`Was the Italian still trying to finish him off, even though he had stopped moving for good?`
`How foolish I've been......`
` Can I still not understand the scene in front of me?!`
`Rejoice, Kinzo!!`
` Now you'll finally get what you've wanted all this time...!!`
`The Italian hadn't fired to finish off Tajima‐kun.`
` He had been aiming at the man Tajima‐kun had fallen on: me, Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
`"Uu......uuu....uwaah......!!!"`
`I pushed his corpse aside, scrabbled against the floor, and dashed away, tumbling over myself.`
`My hands had pushed off against the floor hard enough to tear off the ring finger fingernail on my left hand.`
`{n}When faced with death, humans truly can resist with all they've got.`
`I tumbled over and over as I ran, scraping up parts of my body.`
` It was painful, hot.`
` But that didn't matter at all!`
`I heard the yelling in Italian come from behind me over and over again.`
` It felt like they were running, chasing after me.`
`I didn't want to look back.`
` So I kept on running and running, as though the Italians were right behind me.`
`This......is death......!!`
`{n}Didn't you want to die?`
`No, I don't want to die!!`
` Why?`
` Didn't I want to die so badly?`
`{n}But now, I know.`
`{n}I know how wonderful it is to be alive.`
`She taught me.`
` Bice did.`
`I can only be free when I talk with her.`
` No!`
`{n}By talking with her, I was finally alive for the first time.`
` I was finally born!!`
`I want to live.`
` I want to live, I want to live, I want to live!!`
` I don't want to die!`
`I want to live and see her, right now!!`
` If I don't see her, I'll die! I'll be killed!!`
`.........Stay cool, Kinzo.`
` ......She might be killed too...!`
`If you live and she dies, you might as well be dead......!!`
`Before I knew it, my face was covered in tears, snot, and drool.`
`When I stumbled over something and fell, I was finally able to come to my senses a little.`
`"..................Haah......haah...`
` .................."`
`I could still hear intermittent gunfire.`
`The gunfight was still going on.`
` And it had spread throughout the entire base.`
`......Bice.`
` ......Are you...okay......?`
`I'll find her and take her to a safe place.`
` ......The lieutenant will probably kill all of the Italians to steal the gold.`
` Bice probably won't be an exception.`
`"Bice......`
` .........Bice...!"`
`Meeting you was the first time I ever lived,`
` the first time I was ever born.`
` So if you die, I'll die again.`
`I could feel every cell in my body being reborn, not as Ushiromiya Kinzo, ......but as a completely different Kinzo.`
`......Of course, I was terrified that I might really be shot if I went back.`
`But I no longer wanted to die,`
` in the truest possible sense.`
` So, I was able to overcome my fear.`
`"......Biiiiceeeeeeee!!"`
`«Rubens!`
` What on Earth is going on?!`
` What is all this?!»`
`«There's no need for you to know.`
` Just stay hidden there.`
` Don't come out until one of your fellow countrymen calls for you!»`
`"I heard an Italian voice!!`
` He's over there!!"`
`«Goddamn Asians!!»`
`Rubens stood with Beatrice behind his back and neatly shot the two men rushing at him with two 9mm bullets from his Beretta M1934.`
`However, one of the 8mm bullets from their Type 94 semi‐auto pistols went straight into Rubens's chest.`
`All three of the shooters were struck in the chest and fell down in a heap.`
`«N‐no!!`
` Rubens!!»`
`«......Go up to the surface...`
` Hide in the forest......`
`......*cough*cough*!!`
` Ggh.....»`
`«Rubens!!!»`
`"......Heheheh. My, my.`
` Aren't we chatty?"`
`The next person to appear......was the commanding officer of the Japanese soldiers, Yamamoto.`
`The blast of three guns had just sounded.`
`Adding on Beatrice's screams, it was hardly surprising that he had noticed the encounter.`
`"If it had to come to this anyway, we should've taken this woman as a hostage in the first place.`
` Damn annoying, that's what they are!"`
`Yamamoto spat.`
` Beatrice used that moment to snatch up Rubens's gun.`
`«Aahh......!!!»`
`"Oh, picking up a gun without hesitation!`
` Italian women sure are scary!`
` Dammit, you both managed to screw up...!!"`
`He spat this last part at the two dying men who lay moaning at his feet.`
`However, it wasn't particularly surprising.`
` And this wasn't the only place it was happening.`
`Nearly everyone met head on in these tiny, cramped tunnels.`
` When both sides shot recklessly in a situation like that, the result was two corpses.`
`So the way to be fastest was to pull the trigger immediately the moment you sensed another person.`
` That was the only way to make it through this battle without ending up with a bullet in your chest.`
`Because of this, both Japanese and Italians killed each other without hesitation, and they sometimes even pulled the trigger on their own countrymen when they unexpectedly ran into each other.`
`And in the midst of all this, large numbers of Japanese men who had no idea what was going on ran towards the noise and became victims one after another.`
`It didn't matter whether the other person was holding a gun or not.`
`Everyone reflexively pulled the trigger at the sight of anyone other than themselves, trying to stay alive.`
`The slaughter engulfed the entire base......`
`There was a fierce gun battle taking place in the submarine dock.`
` And a massacre resembling a hunt was taking place inside the base.`
`Most of the non‐combatants assigned to this base were killed before they knew what was going on.`
`The Italians were indeed quite seasoned troops, but their numbers began to drop bit by bit.`
`Blood‐stained corpses lay scattered all across the base......`
`At first, it had probably been a proper gunfight.`
`However, as they gradually became desensitized,`
` it devolved into that most basic cause of wars throughout humanity, the desire to kill all foreigners you don't understand...`
`Whenever they heard words they didn't understand, they pulled the trigger.`
` By that point, the screams of foreigners sounded no different from those of man‐shaped beasts.`
` After all, they couldn't understand pleading in another language.`
`So, it had long ago turned into a mere massacre......`
`As the number of dead surpassed the number of living, ......silence began to return to the base.`
`Just when it felt as though everyone had died and the desolate sound of the wind blew through the caves,`
` there would be a sudden scream, the crisp sound of a gun, and one would remember that the massacre still wasn't over.`
`This happened...over and over again...`
`......until eventually, true silence fell.`
`......It marked the pitiful end for those led astray by gold.`
`The leader of the Italian soldiers, Angelo, had managed to survive somehow.`
`He encountered......nothing but the corpses of friend and foe.`
`All was quiet once more in the base.`
`If he was careless enough to call out, he might be shot from the shadows somewhere.`
`......So, he snuck about like a panther, breathing quietly and searching for the remaining enemies...`
`There was no sign or trace of any living person.`
`......Maybe all of the people in this base had died.`
`«......Damn Japanese......»`
`The Japanese struck first, but at that time, we were also talking about killing them.`
`They simply made the first move as military men.`
`{n}So, perhaps I should be grateful for today.`
`Even if the boat had come to take us away, there would have been no honor for us.`
`We would have been mere failures in our mission, unfit to face our dead comrades.`
`Perhaps dying here in the Far East alongside my gun......is a more fitting end for a soldier.`
`From around the corner, I noticed the sound of a leg being dragged along the ground, and I strained to hear.`
`.........Is someone seriously wounded and shuffling with a limp?`
` Noticing them before they notice me greatly helps my chances.`
`At this stage, there's no point in taking prisoners.`
`{n}We must dispose of all the Japanese.`
`I'll dash around the corner, quickly check to see who they are, ......and shoot if it's a Japanese person.`
` Nothing more.`
`I've been hiding my footsteps the whole time.`
` They probably don't know I'm here.`
`Once the shuffling footsteps had come close enough, Angelo leaned around the corner and raised his gun.`
`The voice that reached him...spoke Italian.`
`«R‐run......»`
`«......?!`
` Y‐you......!!»`
`"Heheheh, I've been looking for you, Ensign Angelo...`
` That makes all of you.`
` I've been counting Italian corpses, you see...!!"`
`«No, don't die!!`
` Ensign Angelo!»`
`Blood poured from Angelo's chest,`
` ......his gun fell to the floor,`
` then his knees,`
` and then the rest of his body crumpled...`
`...and stopped moving.`
`Yamamoto's accuracy with a gun wasn't particularly stellar.`
`However, Angelo had waited until they were fairly close before jumping out, so Yamamoto had been able to hit his target.`
`And he had managed it with a short‐barreled handgun in one hand......and a woman as a hostage in the other.`
`"Really, though, our Rokkenjima garrison was pathetic!`
` Am I the only one who's not dead?!`
` Trash, all of them!"`
`«Can't you fight without using a woman as a shield, you brute?!!`
` Let go!»`
`"Quiet!`
` Noisy, these Italian girls.`
` If you'd just be cooperative, I'd at least spare your life. Heheheh!"`
`It was such an obvious lie that even he wore a bitter smile.`
`"The Italians were spies working for the enemy, and they all died along with the garrison in a gunfight".`
`That was the story Yamamoto wanted to tell, and so he couldn't afford to have any Italian survivors.`
`At this point, he wouldn't be able to keep the entire pile of gold,`
` but he could at least grab as many ingots as he could carry.`
` Even that would be worth a huge amount of money.`
`Beatrice suddenly swung her head,`
` smashing Yamamoto's nose hard.`
`«Someone, help! Someoooooone!!!`
` ......Aaah!!»`
`"Y‐......you...bitch......`
` Ngaaah......"`
`She almost managed to escape.`
` However, Yamamoto quickly grabbed her leg and tripped her.`
`She fell onto her back, and Yamamoto mercilessly stomped his foot down on her stomach and pointed his gun at her.`
`"Heheheh, I don't make a hobby of taming tomboys...!`
` Die!!"`
`"Lieutenant Yamamoto, she had nothing to do with this!`
` Let go of her!"`
`Kinzo had jumped out from the shadows.`
`{n}He was holding a gun he had stolen from one of the corpses.`
`"Hmmm? Ushiromiya?`
` Ah, so you're alive!"`
`"Let her go! You're hurting her...!!"`
`"......It was you, wasn't it?`
` You tipped the Italians off."`
`"What are you talking about...?!"`
`Yamamoto didn't know that the grenade had been a dud.`
`The surprise attack, which he had been certain would work, had failed,`
` so he had decided that Kinzo must have tipped them off.`
`"It's your fault the surprise attack failed, and now look what's happened!`
` You turncoat...`
` I know you've been working with them through this woman!"`
`"Can't you see that you caused all this because you were blinded by gold?!"`
`"<Run, Kinzo!`
` This man has shot people begging for their lives!`
` He'll shoot you too!>"`
`"Don't talk, Italian!`
` If you open your mouth again, I won't hesitate to shoot."`
`"<I‐......it hurts......ggaahhh...>"`
`Yamamoto ground his heel into Beatrice's gut.`
`"Stop it, stop it!!`
` She has nothing to do with this!!"`
`"Oho?`
` Are you pointing a gun at a superior officer?`
` ......Stop and think a bit, fool.`
` If we agree to keep to the same story, we can have that pile of gold all to ourselves, right?`
` ......I could only grab a few for myself, but if we work together, we can sneak off with even more.`
` ......I don't mean this as your superior officer.`
` Let's split it between us as men."`
`"Haven't you already killed the last people you said you'd split the gold with?!"`
`"Tch.`
` Ushiromiya,`
` looks like you prefer lead to gold!!"`
`Without any hesitation, Yamamoto raised the barrel of his gun towards Kinzo and pulled the trigger.`
`It grazed Kinzo's right ear.`
`If Yamamoto's aim had been just a bit better, the bullet would undoubtedly have slammed into Kinzo's face.`
`"<Kinzo?!`
` H‐how could you?!!>"`
`"You.....gyah?!?!"`
`Not letting Yamamoto's momentary distraction go to waste, Beatrice lashed out and planted her right foot in Yamamoto's crotch.`
`After moaning in pain, a demonic expression flashed across Yamamoto's face, and he stomped on her chest.`
`"<Bice!!>"`
`"You biiiiitch!! Diii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}ie!!"`
`Beatrice shut her eyes tightly, hoping that she could withstand the coming pain.`
`No one would want to have their eyes open at the moment they were shot......`
`"Gy‐`
`......y...`
`you...`
`..............."`
`Thick...`
`...spurts of blood...`
`...squirted out of Yamamoto's chest.`
`"Just as you took many lives for your own sake,`
` ......I take your life...`
`...for mine."`
`Was Yamamoto able to hear the last of Kinzo's words to him?`
`In his last moments, Yamamoto seemed to grin.`
`Then, slowly, he fell over backwards,`
` ......a river of blood trailing from his body.`
`"<Kinzo!`
` Are you okay?!`
` I was sure you'd been shot...!`
` Uggh...ggh......>"`
`Beatrice tried to stand up, but then doubled over and started coughing.`
`"<Bice!`
` Are you hurt...?!>"`
`"<......My ribs are hurting.`
` That brute really was stomping them hard.>"`
`"<Will you be alright...?`
` I hope they aren't broken......>"`
`"<Italian women don't break so easily.`
` ......But...thanks.`
` I owe you my life.`
` If you hadn't come, it'd have all ended there.`
` ......Ggh......>"`
`Yamamoto had shown no mercy.`
` ......Her ribs were probably cracked.`
`......We didn't have the option of waiting, possibly for several days, for the ship that was coming.`
`I made the decision to ferry her off this island.`
`The man who kept yelling about preserving the secrecy of the base is lying there dead.`
`......The next island over, Niijima, is close.`
` A small boat should be able to take us there.`
`"<I need to take you to a hospital.`
` ......The wound might be more serious than you realize.>"`
`"<......That's interesting.`
` Never knew there was a hospital on this island.>"`
`"<There isn't.`
` I'll use a boat to take you to the next island.`
` ......I'll take you to a hospital,`
` but I need to return here and clean up the mess on this island, ......or it'll mean a court‐martial.>"`
`"<I have a request.`
` ......Please, don't take me to a hospital.>"`
`"<Why...?>"`
`"<If we go to a hospital and the embassy is contacted, I'll eventually be sent back to Italy.`
` ......If that happens, I'll be interrogated about all kinds of things.`
` I won't acknowledge those people, who let Mama die.>"`
`"<........................>"`
`"<There's no homeland for me to return to now.`
` This is the end for me.`
` So, there's nowhere I want to go anymore.`
` ......The people who were so kind to me—Ensign Angelo,`
` Rubens,`
` and everyone else,`
` ......they're all dead.>"`
`"<And because of that, you want to die here too?`
` I thought you said Italian women weren't weak.`
` Live.>"`
`"<Hey, Kinzo?`
` What does it mean...to live?`
` You're the one who taught me, aren't you?`
` Living is more than just breathing.`
` .........I don't want to go back to Italy.>"`
`"<......Bice.>"`
`"<You've said that you were dead before you met me.`
` But it's the same for me.`
` ......I died in that submarine.`
` My homeland fell, Mama died.`
` Even Papa died.>"`
`"<......I prayed that our sub would just sink to the bottom of the ocean.`
` So, when we reached this place, I was actually disappointed that we'd survived.`
` .........Then, right after that,`
` Ensign Angelo started asking whether anyone could speak English.>"`
`When Kinzo met Beatrice, he finally forgot about dying.`
`And when Beatrice met Kinzo, ......she also forgot about dying.`
`"<I...`
` ......Now that I've lost my homeland, my family, and my friends,`
` ............I wish you would whisk me away.>"`
`"<.........Bice......>"`
`"<But, ......I know that's a wish that couldn't come true.`
` ......So, at the very least,`
` ......I want to be with you until the boat comes for us.`
` I don't care about the pain in my chest.`
` After all, when the boat comes and takes me away, ......I'll die.>"`
`Beatrice spoke this, smiling softly.`
` ......She did her best to hide the pain in her chest.`
`"<Please, Kinzo.`
` ......Just for the few days until the boat comes,`
` ......steal me away.>"`
`"<.........That's a wish...`
`...I cannot grant.>"`
`Looking apologetic, Kinzo lifted Beato up and gently sat her in the boat.`
`"<......Coward.`
` ......So, Japanese men are weak after all.>"`
`"<You're right.`
` ......I am a coward.`
` So, I can only grant you half of your wish.>"`
`With a clunk, he placed the object wrapped in a jacket into the boat.`
`"<What do you mean......?>"`
`"<The part about "until the boat comes for you".`
` ......I can't make that a reality.>"`
`"<......Huh?`
` What do you mean?>"`
`"<Stealing you away.`
` ......That wish, I will make come true.>"`
`"<......K‐......Kinzo.........>"`
`There has to be a doctor on Niijima.`
`I'm wearing a Navy uniform.`
`I should be able to pass myself off as a survivor of a boat carrying a VIP that was sunk by enemy ships.`
`If the doctor happens to be of the greedy sort, all the better.`
`......After all, I have right here the golden magic to make people do what I say.`
`She came from a distant country, took my lifeless body, and gave me a soul.`
`The witch......who came bearing gold......revived me with her magic.`
`"<You...are a witch.`
` ......The Golden Witch.>"`
`"<*giggle*.`
` Yes, the Golden Witch.`
` Even though I use the same recipe as everyone else, only my alchemy can turn pasta into a smoking black heap.>"`
`"<Haha, haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha.>"`
`"<......Just like you, I'm nothing but a corpse that's only allowed to live while you're there beside me.`
` ......If you disappear, I'll die within moments.>"`
`"<I won't let you die.>"`
`"<Really?>"`
`"<No matter what.>"`
`"<Take some responsibility.`
` .........After all, you're the one......who's spirited me away.>"`
`"......I see.`
` So, Kinzo‐san told you that much."`
`"Then, ......wait, it was you?!`
` You're the Niijima doctor that Grandfather took Beatrice to...?"`
`"Why so shocked?`
` He should've leapt to mind at the moment the words "Niijima doctor" showed up."`
`"All of a sudden, a soldier of the Navy appeared along with a foreign woman.`
` Of course, I was astounded.`
` ......What's more, he told me to treat her wounds confidentially, since their presence was a military secret."`
`"Was that the first time you met Grandfather...?"`
`"......Yes.`
` That was when we first met."`
`"So, you're the greedy doctor who followed orders for the sake of the gold?"`
`"That's a bit harsh......`
` He suddenly brought in a foreign woman patient, told me it was a military secret,`
` promised that he'd pay the medical fees later, and handed me a gold ingot as collateral.`
` I didn't want to get involved with any funny business.`
` I was reluctant to say the least."`
`"I see your point.`
` ......But in the end, you did conceal Beatrice, didn't you?"`
`"I may not be as skilled as Kinzo‐san, but I do have some familiarity with English.`
` I managed to overhear part of their conversation, and that was enough to convince me that they were not troublesome people."`
`"*cough*...`
` ......Of course, if I were to say that the ingot didn't tempt me, that would be a lie.`
` I was much younger then, you see."`
`"What happened to her next?"`
`"I treated her for some time before someone came to me on behalf of the Ushiromiya family and said that she would be moved to Odawara.`
` They took her away."`
`"So Grandfather didn't come to get her himself?"`
`"Regardless of how Kinzo explained away the incident on Rokkenjima,`
` he probably wouldn't have been able to move about freely for some time afterwards."`
`"Precisely.`
` Kinzo‐san has said that deceiving the military was the greatest challenge of his life."`
`"So, Beatrice went to Odawara, and then what...?"`
`"I have heard that she hid in one of their unused villas.`
` ......After all, Kinzo‐san already had a family at that time.`
` It must have been tricky to manage."`
`"So, Kinzo was a master of the double life before Kuwadorian even existed.`
` .........Whoosh."`
`"What are you doing...?`
` Is your butt itching?"`
`"......Tch."`
`"And later on?`
` Beatrice and Grandfather continued their happy relationship in the villa from then on...?"`
`"I have heard that it was a modest, peaceful life.`
` ......Several years later, they had a child."`
`"And so Kuwadorian's Beatrice was born."`
`"The birth...didn't go well......`
` Truly a sad tale."`
`"You don't mean...she died?!"`
`"Don't be surprised.`
` Kinzo believed his daughter was Beatrice reborn.`
` ...Don't ignore the heart. It's possible to reason it out."`
`"Y‐......you're right.`
` ......My apologies."`
`"I don't know how many years Kinzo‐san spent with her in Odawara.`
` .........However, judging by Kinzo‐san as we know him afterwards...`
` Even if it was only a few years, one can tell how deeply he loved her."`
`"...........................`
` ......I see."`
`"So then, he made Kuwadorian for his daughter......"`
`"Kinzo‐san cleverly made use of the submarine's gold to build up a fortune in a flash.`
` Then, he made use of his considerable skills in English to make connections with the GHQ, becoming immensely wealthy in a short span of time.`
` I'm sure there's no need to explain this part to you, Lion‐san."`
`"......Yes.`
` He used that vast wealth, ......bought Rokkenjima, and built the mansion.`
` The remaining relatives in Odawara scoffed at Grandfather, thinking he was crazy to buy an entire deserted island."`
`"If you could carry ten tons of gold around in your pocket, Kinzo probably wouldn't have bought Rokkenjima."`
`He hid the gold somewhere in Rokkenjima,`
` built up a fortune with the ingots he'd taken out of it, ......and then bought up the whole treasure island...`
`"Exactly.`
` .........And that started the legend of the Ushiromiya gold."`
`"......What about the mark of the One‐winged Eagle that was supposedly pressed into the ingots?"`
`"It was less a one‐winged eagle......than an eagle that appeared to have only one wing."`
`"What do you mean?"`
`"You see it often in Europe, do you not?`
` A crest or coat of arms with an eagle spreading its wings on it.`
` ......The flag of the Salò Republic also had an eagle—or was it a hawk?—`
`emblazoned on it."`
`"So, the imprint was made too lightly......or else it was poorly done."`
`"Correct.`
` .........It was a hasty, wartime stamping.`
` It was probably supposed to look like the crest of an eagle spreading its wings.`
` But half of it, cut off at a diagonal, was too faded to see."`
`"So half of the eagle spreading its wings disappeared, ......making it look like a One‐winged Eagle?"`
`"Kinzo thought the seal on the gold of Beatrice, the woman who had changed his fate, looked like a one‐winged eagle.`
` That must be why he decided to make that his own crest."`
`"......If the imprint had been made correctly, it would have been the eagle of the Salò Republic's flag,`
` ......or could it have been the two‐headed......"`
`"......No, no, that would be ridiculous.`
` At any rate, passing the night away with Kinzo‐san in front of that massive pile of gold, drinking and dreaming, was truly an enjoyable experience."`
`"However, Kinzo‐san didn't want anyone using that stamp to figure out where the gold had come from.`
` The gold he took outside was all re‐pressed with the One‐winged Eagle design he had created."`
`"And all he did was show you the gold?`
` What a cheapskate."`
`"Of course, after he became immensely rich, Kinzo‐san came to me once more and paid me in full for the overdue medical expenses.`
` The amount he came with was a bit much for medical fees.`
` Though I did make sure to give him his change."`
`"And you've been friends ever since......?"`
`"Yes.`
` Kinzo‐san was extremely grateful to me for keeping his secret and concealing Beatrice."`
`"......Grandfather always says that the old relatives in Odawara were a bunch of greedy liars.`
` ......I'm sure he appreciated your strong sense of duty, Doctor Nanjo.`
` I think I understand why a person like Grandfather came to trust you."`
`"I also had some interest in foreign countries, as well as a hobby of playing chess.`
` Kinzo‐san and I have gotten along well ever since.`
` It was a friendship that built up gradually, but grew strong before we knew it.`
` Yes, we have been friends a very long time......"`
`"People who deal with large amounts of money are quite mindful of small amounts as well.`
` ......When you refused to accept anything more than the medical fees, that must have earned you his admiration."`
`"You think too highly of me.`
` No, I was just frightened by the large quantity of money.`
` I began to regret it later, ......wahahahaha.`
` It seems I've never had real guts."`
`"No need to worry there.`
` Guts are one thing you've got no shortage of."`
`"You think so?`
` Well, I appreciate the flattery."`
`"That wasn't flattery."`
`".........?"`
`......After Kinzo dies, Nanjo is complicit in keeping his death a secret for at least a whole year.`
`Of course, Natsuhi must have given him a fairly hefty sum of hush money.`
`All the same, he's at least gutsy enough to withstand the pressure from Kinzo's children for that amount of time without slipping up once......`
`"You're plenty gutsy, if you ask me.`
` That sense of duty must be part of your character."`
`"......Hahahah.`
` Perhaps that is my only redeeming quality..."`
`"I think Grandfather was blessed with a good friend."`
