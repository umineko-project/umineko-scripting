`Quietly, quietly,`
` ......the rain fell down.`
`The rain of sadness dripped down the outer walls of the chapel, quietly washing away the dust of the world of the living.`
`The chapel doors were open.`
`For a wedding, only those with invitations would be allowed in.`
`However, for a funeral, the doors would be open for all those who remembered the deceased.`
`......So, this must be a funeral.`
`A figure holding an umbrella approached the chapel.`
`It was......Will.`
`"..........................."`
`A reception desk had been set up in the entrance to the chapel.`
`As the figure approached, Kanon, who had been sitting at this desk, stood up and welcomed him with a bow.`
`"......This is the reception desk.`
` We are collecting the names of all mourners.`
` If you would sign in here..."`
`"Sorry,`
` but I'm not here to mourn.`
` ......I'm here to meet with someone."`
`You came to a funeral to meet someone...?`
` A dubious expression rose to Kanon's face.`
`Will pulled an envelope from his pocket and showed him the sender's name.`
`".........My apologies.`
` Please, enter."`
`"Thanks.`
` ......Could I at least have one of those?"`
`"......Thank you very much.`
` ......I am sure she will be pleased."`
`Kanon handed him one of the golden roses being handed out to all the mourners.`
`Will took it,`
` ......silently bowed his head, and entered the chapel.`
`Inside the chapel, several people who appeared to be the family of the deceased were gathered together,`
` and they all seemed to be recalling memories of the departed.`
`"Oooooooohhh...`
` Beatriceeeee...`
` Why,`
` whyy{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}yy...`
` Ooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oohhhhh......"`
`"Father, you must compose yourself......`
` Why don't you rest in the waiting room for a bit..."`
`"........................"`
`"I killed her...`
` I did it......!"`
`"Absurd...!`
` How could that be, Rosa‐sama...?"`
`"Father was really bawling."`
`"......Yeah. "Beatriceeee"."`
`"I'm sure he didn't cry this much when Mother passed away."`
`"Hey.`
` Now's not the time to say things like that."`
`Some sobbed, unable to conceal their tears,`
` and some spoke softly of old memories.`
`......They were all remembering the departed in their own ways......it seemed.`
`When Will approached the altar, several people turned around.`
`{n}Of course, none of them knew who Will was.`
`Paying this no mind, Will walked in front of the casket on the altar, which seemed to be buried in golden roses.`
`......Inside the casket, there was no corpse.`
`Instead, as though it lay there in place of a body,`
` ......there was a single, thick book with an extravagant binding.`
`The space all around it was filled with countless golden roses.`
`There were words printed on the book's cover.`
`"To my beloved Beatrice.`
` October 5th, 1986."`
`"......Miss Beatrice.`
` If it was "Mrs", then forgive me.`
` ......I've never met you.`
` However, allow me to express my condolences."`
`He took the rose he had received from the reception area and placed it in the casket.`
`......He had absolutely no connection with the woman called Beatrice.`
`{n}However, since he had come to visit a funeral, he had to follow this minimum display of respect for the dead.`
`As part of this, Will prayed for the passage of the departed to the next world......`
`"Pardon me,`
` ......but who might you be?`
` I am Ushiromiya Krauss.`
` I am acting in the stead of the chief mourner.`
` This is my child, Lion."`
`"Pleased to meet you.`
` I'm Ushiromiya Lion."`
`"......Lion?`
` .........Just who are you?"`
`"It's written as "{p:0:理御}", but pronounced "Lee‐on".`
` ......Sounds a bit strange for a Japanese name, doesn't it?"`
`"..........................."`
`Will stared at Lion's face, wearing a confused expression.`
`He hadn't seemed to be particularly interested in Krauss, but apparently Lion had drawn some sort of reaction from him.`
`Rather than interest, it was more as though he felt like something was out of place.`
`"......Krauss‐sama.`
` Madam says that it is about time......"`
`"Ah, I see.`
` ......Ladies and gentlemen.`
` If we're too noisy in here, it may disturb the dead.`
` I've been told that the waiting room has been readied.`
` Shall we move over there?"`
`When Krauss called out to everyone, they began to move towards the chapel waiting room.`
`"My apologies.`
` Lion, could you entertain our guest for now?`
` I will guide the others to the waiting room."`
`"Yes, Father."`
`It looked like a natural conversation, with no awkwardness for either father or child.`
`"Father and child, is it?"`
`"Yes, but why do you ask...?"`
`"Ushiromiya Krauss's child is supposed to be Jessica."`
`"Jessica's my little sister.`
` Do you need me to call for her...?"`
`"..................`
` ...No, that won't be necessary."`
`Apparently, ......some sort of game was already being played right off the bat.`
`Scratching at his head with an irritated look on his face, Will glanced around.`
`"......Pardon me, but what sort of relation did you have with the deceased?"`
`"None at all.`
` ......It's a real pain."`
`"............Then why did you come to this funeral?"`
`Since Lion was a fairly mild person, Will's behavior was met with nothing more than a blank expression.`
`{n}......A normal person would probably have put on a dubious look long before this.`
`Will scratched his head again, and yelled angrily at someone other than Lion.`
`"I'm here.`
` Isn't it about time you showed your face?"`
`The members of the Ushiromiya family had already followed Krauss's instructions and moved to the waiting room.`
`By now, this cold, vast chapel decorated with gold roses...`
`was empty except for Will and Lion.`
`"......So, you've come.`
` ......Inquisitor, Wizard‐hunting Wright."`
`The girl's voice came suddenly from behind the pair.`
`When Lion turned around in surprise, a girl had appeared out of nowhere and drifted down on top of the altar.`
`She landed softly on the sacred funeral altar as though this was perfectly normal,`
` crushing the golden roses under her shoes...`
`Of course, Lion did not know this girl.`
`......Just why on Earth were all of these people unrelated to the funeral...`
`popping up one after another?`
`"I'm already retired.`
` If you have a job you need doing, go ask the new Wright."`
`"No.`
` You're the one I want to ask.`
` I'm giving this case to you.`
` ......Did you read the "tale" I sent you...?"`
`"......Skimmed it."`
`"I, I don't know who you are, but please get down from there.`
` That's a sacred altar."`
`Snapping out of a daze, Lion told the girl to get down off the altar, but the girl ignored this completely.`
`On top of that, Will kept on talking to the girl as though Lion wasn't even there.`
`"Lion, was it?`
` Who is this person?"`
`"You've already heard who."`
`Ushiromiya...Lion.`
`There's no case of a person with that name appearing in any of the previous games.`
`"Is this your piece?"`
`"No.`
` It's a true and proper piece of this game board.`
` One of the appearing characters."`
`"You're the Game Master.`
` That means it's your piece."`
`"*giggle*......`
` ......I've just enclosed Beato's cat box in a larger cat box.`
` Lion is one of the pieces who has a possibility of appearing inside it."`
`".........Ah, I see.`
` ......In other words, it's your piece."`
`"It's a piece I've placed...would be the correct way to say it."`
`"So you're saying this piece isn't your subordinate as Erika was."`
`"......Erika? Who's that?`
` ......*giggle*giggle*."`
`"....................."`
`"......Erika...san?`
` ????"`
`"Don't try to understand.`
` You'll just get a headache."`
`Lion didn't have a clue what they were talking about.`
`However, it seemed clear that, though neither of them were familiar, they both knew a lot about the Ushiromiya family.`
`"I, I don't know what you two are talking about...`
` At any rate, you there, Miss.`
` Please, get down off the altar.`
` I ask this as the successor to the Ushiromiya family headship."`
`Even Lion was finally forced to speak in a raised voice at this girl, who continued to chat while casually standing on the altar.`
`However, the girl ignored this completely.`
`{n}On the other hand, Will did show a reaction.`
`".........The successor to the headship is supposed to be Krauss."`
`"My father, Krauss, will be the acting head until I turn twenty.`
` When I turn twenty, I am to succeed the headship."`
`"First I've heard of this.`
` Can you prove it?"`
`It seemed that even Lion was starting to get ticked off by now.`
`{n}That calm expression seemed to twitch slightly.`
`"This is the successor's silver ring of the One‐winged Eagle.`
` Is that proof enough for you?"`
`".........A silver ring?`
` The gold ring of the head has appeared several times, but I've never heard anything about a silver ring for the successor.`
` ......I don't remember Krauss or Jessica ever wearing one of those."`
`"*giggle*......`
` I'm glad.`
` It seems you've read it pretty well for skimming."`
`"When a witch hands you a story, you never know when something absurd will pop up.`
` Especially when it's a Great Witch from the Senate."`
`"Wh‐`
`......who in the world...`
`...are you two?!`
` Sorry, but I don't have a clue what you're talking about.`
` If you've finished offering flowers for the departed, please make your exit.`
` It seems you two are not worthy of our family's hospitality."`
`Lion finally ran out of patience.`
`{n}These were the strictest words that this gentle kid could unleash.`
`However, Will and the girl seemed not to care at all...`
`"I didn't come here because I wanted to."`
`"We're wasting time, so let's move onwards.`
` ......Wright.`
` Try and beat this game.`
` As the Game Master, {f:5:Bernkastel}, I invite you to join this game."`
`"I refuse."`
`"Why?"`
`"I'm retired now.`
` ......Reasoning and mysteries aren't my business anymore."`
`"How do you intend to spend the rest of your life?`
` Is Wizard‐hunting Wright going to give up witch hunting?"`
`"......Oh, there's fox hunting and clam hunting.`
` I didn't come here to discuss the rest of my life with you."`
`"So, you came here to refuse?"`
`"Know that your powers of deduction are truly a sight to behold......"`
`"Then do as you will.`
` Go wherever you please.`
` ......That is, assuming that you can leave the place."`
`"........................Tch.`
` ......So?`
` What are the terms and payment?"`
`In truth, Will had already given up from the beginning.`
`He knew that he was incapable of refusing an invitation from the great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`"‘Who killed {f:5:Beatrice}?’`
` That's my game.`
` In payment, I'll forgive you for your insolence and let you leave this chapel."`
`"I heard that witches who have no love for boredom are very fond of insolent speech."`
`"That's only for hags who've tired of life after a thousand years.`
` I'm still plenty young, so what I love to do to rude men like yourself...`
`is dream up horrible fates in which to trap you......"`
`"......Tch.`
` So?`
` Who's the enemy?"`
`"There is none.`
` There's no one to stand in your way.`
` We just want to sit back and watch you make your beautiful checkmate in this game......`
` I've even found you an ally.`
` That's what this Lion is for."`
`"......?"`
`After hearing that name spoken out of the blue, Lion frowned once more.`
`Apparently, they were moving things along without Lion's knowledge or understanding, which was truly irritating.`
`"Lion is a member of the Ushiromiya family.`
` Since no one in that family knows you, Lion should prove to be a useful ally."`
`"......I fail to understand what you are talking about, but I can't help you with anything unless I know the details."`
`"There, see?`
` ......With help like this, it'll be a piece of cake."`
`"Entertain me......and my master, Wizard‐hunting Wright.`
` ......Auau may be a polite theatergoer,`
` but I might throw popcorn at you if I get bored, got that...?"`
`".............................."`
`Will scratched at his head with a displeased look on his face.`
`He wasn't at all interested in getting involved,`
` ......but by now, he realized that he couldn't disobey {f:5:Bernkastel}'s orders.`
`Then, he approached the casket...`
`and pointed at its rose‐filled insides.`
`"You ask me to solve the case of {f:5:Beatrice}'s murder, but...`
` {p:1:Van Dine's Twenty Rules, Rule #7.`
` It is forbidden to have a crime without a corpse}."`
`"{p:2:That's a Devil's Proof.`
` Maybe it just isn't inside the casket?`
` Unless you can prove that no corpse exists, this is mystery}."`
`"{p:1:Rule #1. It is forbidden to have a crime without all clues presented}."`
`"{p:1:Don't worry.`
` Everything is gathered here}."`
`".............................."`
`There was no change to Will's unsatisfied expression,`
` ......but he seemed to have understood that everything was at least in order.`
`......From the moment he was summoned by an uninhibited, fickle, cruel Great Witch of the Senate,`
` a mere Inquisitor like him was bound to be treated as no more than an underling.`
` He had never possessed a way to refuse her...`
`".........So, you want me to find out who killed the owner of this empty casket.`
` ......Fine, I accept.`
` However, you'll let me do things my way."`
`"As you like."`
`"First off, .........I need to make you understand what's going on."`
`"......Yes, that would be a great relief."`
`Lion's face was a goulash of displeased expressions,`
` seeming nonplussed, angry, and confused all at the same time.`
`"Over here.`
` ......It'll be faster to see it for yourself."`
`"......Wonderful.`
` Please, lead the way."`
`Will signaled with his chin for Lion to follow him and spun around.`
`After snorting once in an unsatisfied manner,`
` Lion followed Will while looking deeply sceptical of the latter's ability to explain any of this in a way that would make sense.`
`......As she watched the pair leave the chapel,`
` ......{f:5:Bernkastel} sneered silently at them, with a cold smile on her face.`
`".........As the miko of the great Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating,`
` {f:5:Featherine} Something {f:5:Auaurora}, and the Witch of Miracles,`
` I, {f:5:Bernkastel}, announce the start of this game."`
`"......The tale's title is "Requiem of the Golden Witch".`
` ......Spin a tale fitting for Beato's funeral.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*.`
` Well now, let's see just how you drag out the guts."`
`After watching the pair leave the chapel...`
`...{f:5:Bernkastel}'s form evaporated into the empty air, just as she had arrived.`
`All that remained was her unpleasant cackling......`
`Outside, it was still raining.`
`When Kanon saw the guest and the head's successor approaching the reception desk, he bowed deeply.`
`"......Good work.`
` You can take a break now, so would you mind leaving?`
` Umm,`
` ............"`
`"...............It's Kanon.`
` Yes, as you wish."`
`Kanon bowed deeply, then disappeared.`
`"You don't bother to remember the names of your servants?"`
`"......Our family has many young servants coming in and out, and they are usually replaced quite frequently.`
` Anyway.`
` What's going on, and how are you going to explain it to me?`
` Who are you, and what business do you have with this family?`
` Of course, I'm not really in need of a satisfying explanation.`
` I'd be just as happy for you to head on home."`
`"There is no going home.`
` Not for me,`
` ......not for anyone."`
`"Could you please give that a rest?`
` Stop speaking in confusing riddles like that all the time.`
` Even I have limits to my patience.`
` If you don't want me to see you off, should I call Genji or Gohda?"`
`"Stop talking.`
` .........Look at this."`
`"Yes, I can see what it is.`
` It's one of the memorial roses.`
` Are you going to show me some kind of magic trick?"`
`Will took one of the flower offerings,`
` then showed it to Lion, as if to demonstrate that there were no mechanisms or tricks.`
`Then, he slowly lifted it upwards.`
`"......Watch."`
`"Yes, I'm watching.`
` Is a dove going to fly out of it?`
` Or is it going to be flags and fireworks?`
` .........Huh?"`
`Will threw the rose.`
`Anyone would have expected it to fly in an arc...`
`and land in some puddle amid the wind and rain.`
`The betrayal of that expectation struck Lion dumb.`
`Initially, the rose Will had thrown had certainly flown in an arc.`
`It swished rapidly through the air.`
`However, as soon as it was about to pass from the shade of the eaves into the rain,`
` ......it stopped right in midair,`
` as though the air surrounding it had turned into syrup.`
`That wasn't all.`
`As it hung in midair, the rose's beautiful golden petals began to darken one after another,`
` ......and it became a black husk, like burnt charcoal.`
`And, even after this happened, it remained suspended there in the air......`
`"......What sort of trick is this?`
` .........Ah—"`
`"Don't move."`
`Lion had moved closer to try and touch the remains of the rose, which still hung in the air.`
`Will had roughly blocked the way with his arm.`
`It was as though he was telling Lion that leaving this place meant certain death.`
`"......This chapel has been cut off from the fragment.`
` We're currently locked within a maelstrom of compressed time."`
`"What...`
`...do you mean by that...?!"`
`".........Explaining's a pain, so I'll give you the short version.`
` Basically, unless we play along with that witch's game, no one can leave this place."`
`"Wh‐......what are you talking about...?!`
` The funeral is already over!`
` I'm sure some people will want to return to the mansion or the guesthouse.`
` We can't be locked up in here!"`
`"If you've got a problem, that witch is the one to hate.`
` Being stuck in a place like this isn't any more pleasant for me."`
`"That girl's your friend, right?!`
` Make her stop all this weirdness."`
`"She's probably sitting in a spectator's seat with a bucket of popcorn about now.`
` Even if I call her, she won't come."`
`"Wh‐what on Earth is going on?!!"`
`That short sentence described all of Lion's feelings at that moment.`
`However, Lion had seen the rose Will threw wither in an instant in the rainy darkness.`
`......Lion tried doing the same thing with another rose, but the effect was exactly the same.`
`No one would want to use their own body to test this fearsome something that could make roses crumble instantly......`
`"There's only one way for us to be released from here.`
` ......We have to play along with {f:5:Bernkastel}'s game."`
`"......You mean the one about who killed Beatrice?"`
`"That's what she's telling us to investigate.`
` If you could tell me about it, it'd make things go more quickly.`
` ......That fickle witch will be totally satisfied.`
` You'll be able to get rid of the two of us, and I get to go home in time for my date with Diana.`
` ......If I keep her waiting too long, she'll start tearing up the sofa again."`
`"Who killed Beatrice, you say......`
` That's hardly something to go barging into a funeral and start asking the family about."`
`"Questioning the family of the deceased is one of the basics of the mystery genre.`
` Just give up and accept it.`
` ......I do know that Beatrice is the mistress of Kinzo, the family head."`
`".....................`
` You really are a strange person.`
` ......How do you know so much about this family?`
` ......Are you sure you have no connections with us...?"`
`Will knew so much about the Ushiromiya family because {f:5:Bernkastel} had shown him all of the fragments so far.`
`Of course, he had no sort of connection with the Ushiromiya family himself.`
`{n}The very plane of his existence was on a different level.`
`"However, Beatrice died a long, long time ago.`
` According to Genji, she passed away before the mansion was completed,`
` but the reason for her death is unclear.`
` .........To be honest, this is the first I've heard that she was "killed".`
` ......Tell me about it."`
`".........My name is Ushiromiya Lion."`
`"Willard.`
` Call me Will."`
`For the first time, Will introduced himself.`
`The mutual introduction was finally completed, and Lion was finally able to talk with him on an even footing.`
`......However, Lion took a deep breath, and looked up at the sky, wearing a vague smile.`
`"Will‐san."`
`"Call me Will.`
` I'll call you Lion."`
`"......Will.`
` To be honest, ......even I don't know much about this person called Beatrice."`
`"...............I see.`
` I guess it's called a game for a reason."`
`If only Lion could've told him everything, revealing the truth without any effort from Will......`
`Apparently, things wouldn't be so easy after all.`
`"Everyone who enters the Ushiromiya family knows the name and image of Beatrice."`
`"That's because of the massive portrait hanging in the entrance hall, isn't it?`
` That portrait was first displayed in April of 1984."`
`"Really, ......how is it that you know so much?`
` ......Ah, well.`
` It's about time I stopped finding that odd.`
` I'm sure you'll just start speaking in riddles again."`
`Lion was the successor to the head and lived with the main family.`
`{n}Kinzo frequently chose to speak with his successor.`
`Because of this, Lion must have been used to chatting with people who were moody or hard to follow.`
`Deciding once and for all that getting hung up on trivialities would be nothing but a waste of time,`
` Lion was able to converse naturally with this unknown man called Will, as though the two of them had been friends for a long time......`
`"Everyone knows Beatrice.`
` And yet, no one knows her.`
` Kinzo's the only one who's ever met her."`
`"......The head seems to be particularly upset today.`
` I'll find a good time to introduce you to him, so I ask that you adopt an appropriately reserved and polite attitude, Will‐san."`
`"That makes things easy.`
` ......I thought you'd resist a bit more than that."`
`"I'm used to speaking with the family head.`
` I've learned to accept most unreasonable situations and just go with the flow."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} had set up a "barrier" cutting the chapel off from the rest of the world.`
`To destroy that, they would have to find out "who killed {f:5:Beatrice}".`
`For Lion, who had been made to go along with Kinzo on many an occasion, understanding this much was all that was necessary......`
