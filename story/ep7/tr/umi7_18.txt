`"............And that...`
`...is the end of my tale."`
`"Oh,`
` ......you're ending it there?`
` But aren't the next two years the fun part...?"`
`"We don't need them.`
` ......After all we've heard in the past games about your inner conflict and how you suffered,`
` you don't need to say any more."`
`"............You mean......the conflict of the furniture with incomplete souls?"`
`"There was a duel.`
` The result had almost been decided.`
` .........However, the year 1986......was incredibly merciless."`
`"......I'll bet you cursed your fate."`
`"Yes.`
` .........If it had been one year sooner.`
` ......Or else, one year later."`
`"The duel would've been settled... Though in different forms."`
`Silently, Clair hung her head.`
`......If only I had been given time...`
` Or else, if I hadn't been given time to think and agonize.`
`I curse...everything.`
` Why......did it have to be 1986?`
`"I decided...`
`...to delegate my fate."`
`".........Delegate it......"`
`"Like the ritual by which I inherited everything from the previous head,`
` ......I decided to put myself in the hands of that fate called a miracle."`
`It may be more accurate to say that I entrusted my fate to a spin of the roulette.`
`I—we—could not even decide our own fate,`
` so we let fate decide everything for us.`
`Perhaps someone's efforts would be rewarded.`
`{n}Or, perhaps all would be joined and set free.`
`{n}Or, perhaps someone would be kind enough to put a stop to this lunacy.`
`"......No matter which fate the roulette chose,`
` I planned to obey its ruling.`
` I would not resist fate.`
` ......After all, ......whenever I have tried in the past, fate has always been heartless to me........."`
`Clair hung her head and let a single tear drop down...`
`{y:0:Human}{n:0:Human}s will carelessly say that people have infinite possibilities.`
`{n}However, the Endless Witch......knows how limited those possibilities really are.`
`So, within the limits of her fate, she tried to find the infinite.`
`By entrusting her fate to God, she tried to find the infinite.`
`However, this did not mean that she abandoned her fate.`
`{n}Because she spun fate's roulette with an unshakable and certain will.`
`A certain fate, where absolutely no one could escape if the epitaph was not solved.`
`With it, she sealed up the island, herself included.`
`October 4th and 5th, 1986, were sealed away by an absolute and certain will,`
` .........and she entrusted herself to one of the fates that could be chosen in that short span of time on that island.`
`".........And now,`
` my confession truly is over.`
` ......This should be enough to find the motive for the crime.`
` .........If you still do not know, I will say no more.`
` It's not as though...anyone could understand my heart anyway."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......There's no need to say any more."`
`"......After watching how I wandered into a dead‐end of fate,`
` ......Lion, do you see how great a hope you represent to me?"`
`"........................`
` ............I'm...a different possibility for you."`
`"The fact of your happiness makes me jealous, but to an even greater degree, it shines brightly in my eyes.........and makes me smile.`
` ......You were a possible future.`
` .........Right now, .........that fact is my salvation."`
`".........I.................."`
`"......Live with enough happiness for the both of us.`
` I'm glad I got to meet you once...at the end.`
` .........You have my thanks,`
` Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}."`
`".........I'm just carrying out your funeral.`
` There's no need to thank me.`
` ......Well, it's about time to end this.`
` It's about time to send the dead to the land of the dead."`
`"..................Yes.`
` This is my funeral, after all.`
` It's time for me to go back to where I belong."`
`"................................."`
`"Don't make that face.`
` And please, rejoice that you are not me.`
` After all, I rejoice in that fact as well."`
`".........I'll live.`
` ......I'll live life for the both of us..."`
`"Thank you.`
` .........Live in happiness.`
` And someday, find yourself a wonderful person.`
` ......I pray that you live as a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, without awakening as a witch.`
` ......That you have a whole and single soul...and love one person with all your strength...`
` ......I hope you live your life like that."`
`"............Okay......"`
`"Will‐san.`
` I thank you for being an observer.`
` ......You aren't the one I truly wanted to understand me, ......but you have saved my heart."`
`"I...understand you.`
` I don't ignore the heart."`
`".........Thank you.`
` ............So, now that I have a splendid observer who understands me, ......I want to entrust my final moments to you."`
`".....................Are you sure?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......For me, the important thing is whether the person understands me, not how well I know them."`
`......The one I wanted to understand me...didn't.`
`{n}......A person with no connection to me...did.`
`There's nothing sad about it.`
` On the contrary, the fact that a person with no relation to me was still able to understand me is a miracle that I feel grateful for.`
`"You are a good observer...and the only one who has managed to understand me.`
` ......That connection is strong enough."`
`"............Alright."`
`"I offer my heart to you, ......nameless and wonderful observer."`
`"..........................."`
`"......Lion.`
` Get back."`
`"Huh?`
` ......What's going to happen...?"`
`"A mystery story can't meet its death...unless the detective performs the last rites."`
`"............Will just stopping your heart be enough...?"`
`"When you mourn the dearly departed, do you put just their heart into the coffin?"`
`".........Got it.`
` ......That which was born from earth will return to earth.`
` ......I'll return all of you to the earth."`
`"Earth to earth.`
` Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.`
` Illusions to illusions.`
` And dreams to dreams."`
`"..................Right."`
`".........Then let us begin.`
` .........This is my...burial."`
`"Whenever you're ready."`
`"Let us start.`
` ......In the manner of the end of my final game."`
`Light gathered at Will's back, and a sword materialized there.`
`Slowly, ......he drew it out.`
`Its pitch‐black tip, which could neatly slice apart truth from fiction,`
` swung once, leaving a black trail, and then again, leaving a white trail.`
`".........I'll cut the truth out from the fiction.`
` ............Come."`
`Following Will's lead, a similar sword appeared in Clair's hand.`
`Its tip glinted silver, the opposite of Will's.`
`"First game, first twilight.`
` Six corpses in the gardening shed."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ......The corpse that cannot return to earth returns to illusions."`
`Will's pitch‐black slash cut across Clair's body at an angle.`
`The blade passed through her like she was water, ......but its tip sent golden flower petals scattering.`
`"First game, second twilight.`
` Two corpses are close together in a locked room protected by a chain."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ......A chain of illusions can imprison only illusions."`
`The razor‐thin black blur sent golden flower petals scattering again...`
`"First game, fourth twilight.`
` The old head from the locked‐room study, confined in a scorching furnace."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ......Let the man of illusions go to where he belongs."`
`"First game, fifth twilight.`
` The last moments of the boy who offered his chest to a stake."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ......The witch and stake of illusions can pierce naught but illusions."`
`"First game, sixth, seventh, and eighth twilights.`
` Three corpses lying in the locked room of the singing girl."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ......Illusions are the blind girl's song. Illusion of a locked room."`
`"...............Well done.`
` ......Yes, you really are splendid."`
`"......That was a risky game from the very start.`
` ......What would you have done if he'd insisted on seeing your face and just stepped inside?"`
`"That's what it means to entrust yourself to fate."`
`".........And that's the roulette you were talking about."`
`"Let us continue.`
` Second game, first twilight.`
` Six with their stomachs split in the locked‐room chapel."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ......The gold truth locks the lock of illusions."`
`"Second game, second twilight.`
` Even the corpses of the two who are close cannot be close."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ......Illusions who have fulfilled their role do not leave a corpse."`
`"Second game, fourth, fifth, and sixth twilights.`
` In Natsuhi's locked room, none are left alive."`
`"Earth to earth.`
` ......No one would dispute that a coffin is a locked room."`
`"Second game, seventh and eighth twilights.`
` The two sliced to death by the red‐eyed phantom."`
`"Earth to earth. Illusions to illusions.`
` ......No illusion can create a corpse."`
`Every time the blade passed through Clair's body, golden flower petals flew everywhere.`
`......Bit by bit, the petals covering her heart were being torn away.`
`The witch illusion......was scattering.`
`"Third game, first twilight.`
` Six corpses connected by the linked locked rooms."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ......In a locked‐room ring, the end and the beginning overlap."`
`"Third game, second twilight.`
` The corpses of mother and child lie together in the rose garden."`
`"Earth to earth.`
` ......No falsehoods in their final moments as told."`
`"Third game, fourth, fifth, and sixth twilights.`
` Three corpses lying in the mansion."`
`"Earth to earth.`
` ......No falsehoods in their final moments as told."`
`"Third game, seventh and eighth twilights.`
` The corpses of husband and wife lie exposed under the arbor."`
`"Earth to earth.`
` ......The obvious culprit wields the blade of impermanence."`
`"Fourth game, first twilight.`
` A massacring storm sweeps through the dining hall."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ......Tales woven by the gold truth return to illusions."`
`"Fourth game, second twilight.`
` The two young ones face their trials and pass away together."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ......Tales woven by the gold truth return to illusions."`
`"Fourth game, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth twilights.`
` None of the runaways are left alive."`
`"Earth to earth. Illusions to illusions.`
` ......Silent corpses, adorned by fiction."`
`"Fourth game, ninth twilight.`
` And none shall be left alive."`
`"Earth to earth. Illusions to illusions.`
` ......Fiction locked inside a cat box becomes truth."`
`......Over and over again, Clair's body was sliced by the pitch‐black sword.`
`As proof, the chapel was now filled with golden flower petals, ......which danced around like gold snow.`
`".........It's beautiful............"`
`"Who wouldn't want their last moments to be like that?"`
`The gold snow was like confetti at the finale of a show.`
`{n}The curtains were finally falling on the stage that was her.`
`"......Then, one final question."`
`"............Sure."`
`Clair slowly raised her hands.`
`{n}The sword she held became golden rose petals and melted away.`
`She stood there, arms wide, waiting for the final strike......`
`"Who...am I......?"`
`"Illusions...to illusions.`
` ......The promised reaper lowers the curtains on the tale regardless of the witch's will."`
`The wide swing of Will's pitch‐black blade...`
`......cleaved through Clair's form.`
`Blown away by a powerful gust of wind,`
` ......her human form crumbled in an instant, became a storm of golden flower petals, and was torn apart.`
`After she was blown away, a golden heart remained in midair,`
` but it too was swallowed by the vortex of wind and broke down into flower petals.`
`The golden vortex swirled around the chapel......`
` Then, the swirl of petals gradually scattered out of existence......and vanished......`
`A few remaining petals danced around like snowflakes,`
` and those final vestiges decorated the chapel beautifully.`
`.........A beam of light lit the center of the stage.`
`There stood Clair, whose tale had ended.`
`Then, slowly, ......softly, .........she faced the audience and bowed.`
`Applause spread throughout the theater.`
`The long, long tale she had just finished telling was being given massive applause.`
`It went on and on.`
` .........And on and on.`
`The stage slowly sunk into the darkness of oblivion.`
`Clair continued to bow in front of the unending applause......and as the curtain fell, she faded into the darkness.`
`......People are born with sin...and live life to obtain forgiveness from someone.`
`Or perhaps they are born as mysteries...and live life searching for someone to solve them.`
`Here, all of her riddles had been solved, ......with no lingering regrets.`
`People are riddles.`
`They want someone else to solve their riddle.`
`{n}They live life wanting someone to solve the riddle that they are, the most difficult riddle in the world.`
`They want someone to look at the riddle they are.`
`{n}And they want that person to solve it.`
`For her, that wish has been granted......`
`.........Her soul will wander no longer.`
`Rest in eternal slumber......within your cat box coffin.........`
`Though there had been so many golden flower petals flitting about like a blizzard, ......not a single one remained.`
`Everything had become dust, vanished as though there had been nothing there in the first place, ......and all was silent once more.`
`Even the sound of rain was gone.`
` The rain must have stopped at some point.`
`".............................."`
`".........Meeting you was her salvation."`
`"I......hope so."`
`"She cursed herself and her inescapable, dead‐end fate...and gave up.`
` ......Meeting you, a happy miracle in her eyes, saved her in a way nothing else could.`
` ......So don't make that face."`
`"...........................Heh."`
`"That was a pretty tasteful ending...for you."`
`"......Auau only told me to carry out the funeral.`
` ......Well, I just called a facilitator, you, and let you do everything."`
`"Thank you, Will."`
`".........Nn."`
`"In Clair's place, I want to thank you.`
` ......Thanks for cutting off all the lingering regrets...for a "me" of a different fate."`
`".........I thought I'd see a bit more head clutching and blind confusion from you."`
`"I understand now.`
` ......I realize how happy my life has been.`
` ......If fate had toyed with me...and if I was living in another world, I might have gotten stuck in the same dead‐end of fate.`
` ......However, thanks to an extremely improbable bit of good luck, I live in this world.`
` ......I now know how much that means...how much it's worth."`
`"................................."`
`".........What's up?`
` Why the significant look?"`
`"I thought decent witches didn't exist,`
` ......but I might have to change that theory."`
`"Don't worry, no need to change it.`
` ......I only joined that kid's game to kill some time.`
` ......And, though I lost, I enjoyed playing."`
`"......That kid died without folding up her game board.`
` ......I just took charge of cleaning up...as thanks to her for letting me play and because it's the loser's duty."`
`".........I was sure you'd be a lot crueler than this."`
`"Crueler?"`
`"I thought this'd be a cruel game that ignores the heart."`
`"Yes, it was a cruel game.`
` .........Though she claimed that the game was fantasy,`
` I've brought you along and made it end as a mystery.`
` ......The witch illusion has been spectacularly crushed, and my little bit of revenge is complete."`
`".............................."`
`"To bring an end to this tangled tale of love with absolute and certain willpower.`
` ......Out of respect for that certain willpower, the Witch of Certainty made that kid a witch for just two days."`
`"......Even within this limited span of two days, I've been able to enjoy an endless kaleidoscope.`
` ......I won't be bestowing my favor, so no miracle will occur.`
` .........However, even that ending is something that child wished for."`
`"......Which truth did those endless tales settle on in the end?"`
`"Who knows?`
` ......We can't say for sure—that's what makes it a cat box."`
`"When you open the box, you get a tale where no trace of the mansion remains, and no one except Eva survives.`
` ......And since Eva died without saying anything, all the truth is inside the cat box.`
` .........Endless possibilities, all kept within a limited box."`
`"......Now that I think about it,`
` maybe the whole island where she lived and died was the Golden Land."`
`"If you can call a cat box a Golden Land, that is.`
` ......And of all the imaginable stories that could occur within that cat box, Battler wrote the most enjoyable."`
`"......You mean that book in {f:5:Beatrice}'s coffin?"`
`"That's right.`
` .........It's the happiest possible tale for her, which he thought up himself."`
`"It was a really fun, love‐filled, ......happy tale.`
` ......I also think......that tale was the most fitting one to put in her coffin."`
`"No, that's wrong."`
`"......Huh?"`
`"............You heard Clair.`
` ......{i:You} are her hope and her salvation.`
` More than anything else, it's {i:you} living on in happiness that will be her salvation."`
`"........................`
` ............Right."`
`"......Live happily.`
` That's all you need to do to be that kid's miracle."`
`"Yes.`
` .........I'll live happily enough for the both of us."`
`"......I'm surprised you found this kid.`
` Didn't you have to search through about...`
`two million of them in that vast sea?"`
`"Such trivialities are all I am capable of."`
`"...............Hmph."`
`"And now, the funeral is over.`
` .........As promised, I've released the barrier.`
` Once you leave, time will start moving again like normal."`
`"So, you're done with us now.`
` If I don't get back quickly, Diana'll start scratching the curtains."`
`"......We weren't together long, but thank you for your help."`
`"So long.`
` Be happy...for the sake of the millions of other "you"s."`
`When he left the chapel, a beautiful after‐rain sky stretched out above him.`
`That sky, which was a mix of rain clouds, gaps of sunlight, and the tint of twilight, had a beauty to it that couldn't be described in words.`
`Will slowly descended the stone stairs, stepping in the puddles.`
`{n}Then, he waved without looking back...and left the chapel behind.`
`His form and footprints gradually faded away......until there was no trace left.`
`"Okay, time for me to disappear too.`
` ......Goodbye, Lion."`
`"I have you to thank as well.`
` ......I believe I said some fairly inconsiderate things to you.`
` You have my apologies.`
` ......You taught me something very important."`
`"......................................."`
`"......What is it?"`
`"No, it's nothing.`
` ......It's been a century since anyone's thanked me, so I wasn't sure how to respond."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} shrugged, then floated up into the air.`
`Then, she looked up at the beautiful seven colors of light shining in through the stained glass...`
`and spoke as though someone was looking down on her from there.`
`"Auaurora.`
` Was that enough of an answer check for you?`
` If you still don't get it, why not gather the other observer witches and have a tea party or something? Then you can listen to their theories."`
`"I'm mean, so I won't give any more hints than this.`
` There are no witches who don't think.`
` After all, witches who don't think either die or turn to seaweed."`
`"......Now, it's time to go back and have a drink, ...while discussing how much of your theory was right.`
` I'm tired of playing the part of the bad guy...and of being a miko.`
` You're done with me now.`
` ......Bye, Lion.`
` And bye to you too, observer witches."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} burst and disappeared.`
`{n}A single golden flower petal glittered.`
`......Lion picked it up.`
`{n}It was the only trace of a miracle that remained in this chapel......`
`At that time, cheery voices could suddenly be heard.`
`It was the relatives.`
` They came out of the waiting room, one by one.`
`"So this is where you were, Lion.`
` I was looking for you."`
`"Mother.`
` My apologies.`
` I was just thinking about something."`
`"Looks like the rain's finally stopped!`
` Finally some good weather!"`
`"Everyone,`
` let us return to the mansion.`
` I have been told that {f:5:Beatrice}'s funeral is over."`
`"Father, where's the head?"`
`"He'll be here in a sec.`
` Today was pretty crazy.`
` Playing along with Dad's little funeral show was a real pain."`
`"You shouldn't say that.`
` It was a very important ceremony."`
`"That's right.`
` I think it was very important for Father."`
`"I'm starving.`
` Gohda‐san, think you could cook something up for us?"`
`"Yes, ma'am!`
` I'll prepare some tea at once."`
`".........Where is Lion...?!`
` Lend me a hand."`
`"Our family head...! There you are."`
`As Kinzo came out after the others, Lion ran up to him.`
`"......You did very well today.`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice}'s funeral is now complete."`
`"Yes.`
` ......And I'm sure that {f:5:Beatrice}'s soul was saved."`
`"..................`
` ......How could you know that?"`
`"I was with {f:5:Beatrice} until a second ago.`
` ......And I saw her leave on her journey with no regrets.`
` That's how I know."`
`"......................................."`
`"......I guarantee it."`
`"I see.`
` ............If you say it, then it must be so."`
`The relatives left the chapel one by one.`
`{n}Lion left too, giving Kinzo a shoulder to lean on.`
`A beam of sunlight peeked through the clouds,`
` ......looking like a staircase leading up to heaven.`
