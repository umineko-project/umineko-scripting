`{m:-5:—}—Witness to your final dream,`
`{e:080:{f:5:Publius Virgilia Maro}}}`
`The suspects were gathered in a room, and several Inquisitors were reporting on the results of their investigation.`
`Their uniforms closely resembled those of Eiserne Jungfrau, but they were slightly different.`
` Also different were the badges signifying their department.`
`Then came the sound of someone clapping their hands once.`
`{n}It was the lead female Inquisitor.`
`It was her signal that all reasoning had been completed.`
`"For your attention: it is now beyond doubt.`
` The preceding logic has proven the nonexistence of your alibi."`
`At the other end of her pointing finger was a quivering maid with frightened eyes.`
`Her name was—`
`no, that wasn't important.`
`All that mattered now was that she could have freely entered the locked‐room study where the victim was found,`
` and furthermore, that it had been proven that her claimed alibi for the time of the crime was contradictory.`
`Shaking, the maid tried to continue her illogical pleading, but all her arguments had already been destroyed.`
`"With this, we have found sufficient proof for the whodunit and the howdunit.`
` Know that your position as the culprit is now an unshakable fact."`
`"Y‐you must be joking...!`
` Wh‐wh‐why would I kill the Master I loved and respected so...?!`
` I, I have no motive, no reason...!"`
`"......Who did it and how.`
` Know that these are all that need to be established.`
` For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.`
` Know that motives are unnecessary in mysteries."`
`The Inquisitor spoke coldly.`
`After finishing her witch's prayer, {f:5:Virgilia} stepped back from the casket, which lay on an altar bedecked with many beautiful roses.`
`In her place, Battler moved to the front of the casket, wearing his territory lord's cape......`
`Though the cape was supposed to represent dignity and majesty,`
` it somehow made Battler look smaller.`
`Battler held a book with a majestic binding in his hand.`
`It was......a game record that had just been written.`
`Or, perhaps it was a tale.`
` A game.`
` Or else a fragment.`
`Written in it......`
`was the "dream" that would be more enjoyable for her than any other......`
`Battler pressed it against his forehead and contemplated for some time.`
`"................................."`
`Then, he kissed it, .....and laid it gently in the casket.`
`It was placed upon her chest.`
`It made her look like a little girl clutching her favorite stuffed animal as she drifted off to sleep......`
`"......This story is my gift to you.`
` ......The only one there will ever be."`
`This tale will be shut up with you in your casket for all eternity.`
`So, no one will be able to read it except for you in your casket.`
`"Shut away in that cat box,`
` the only...`
`unchanging,`
` inviolable,`
` ......eternal tale."`
`"This way,`
` ......no one will be able to defile her tale.`
` ...No one can deny it,`
` and no one can argue against it.`
` ......Belonging to just me and her,`
` ......just the two of us,`
` this is the one and only...`
`certain truth."`
`Those bastards......`
`A man dashed through a town wrapped in twilight.`
`The daytime hustle and bustle of this charming old‐fashioned village, which combined tradition with stylistic beauty in the classic style of the last century, now seemed like a mere dream.`
`The orange setting sun was already hidden behind the clock tower, and the narrow alleyways were rapidly descending into darkness.`
`As the gas lights began to turn on, they only made the darkness of the twilight stand out all the more.`
`The man sprinted.`
` There was no time.`
` He had to hurry.`
`He'd had several experiments to do and things he had to check, and it had all taken longer than he'd expected.`
`"Yes, there's no mistake there.`
` The whodunit and howdunit are all you need in mysteries."`
`In the mystery genre, the motive, or the whydunit, is given the least precedence.`
`The only thing needed for a murder to exist is for a culprit to commit it.`
`No part of that requires a motive.`
` So, it's usually the most ignored element.`
`In fact, these days, there are even some who call it an unnecessary element in mystery stories.`
`"If you determine the culprit with nothing but the whydunit, that's no mystery.`
` That's propaganda.`
` However..."`
`That doesn't mean you can ignore the motive.`
`It doesn't make it okay to ignore the heart.`
`"......We both know how enjoyable her final rest will be.`
` So, I doubt there is anyone who could disturb it.`
` ......After all, who could possibly disturb the sleep of a child dreaming with a smile on their face?"`
`".............................."`
`"Come.`
` ......It is time for us to leave.`
` If we're too noisy, we'll wake her from her dream."`
`"......You're right.`
` What else should you do with a sleeping kid except put a blanket on them,`
` ......turn off the lights, and walk away quietly..."`
`After looking at the casket one last time, {f:5:Virgilia} turned around quietly.`
`Battler did the same, .........but he then stopped and turned to face the rose‐covered altar...`
`".............................."`
`Battler said his final words with his heart.`
`As long as those words didn't leave his mouth, no one would ever know what they were.`
`......However, those words of the heart caused Battler's expression to change several times.`
`At first, he frowned sadly, ......then, his face clouded with remorse, and then changed to a resigned, bittersweet smile.`
` ......It flashed through several varied expressions.`
`Then, ......the final expression that crossed his face, was, surprisingly,`
` ......a gentle smile.`
`".....................`
` ............"`
`Something rose to Battler's lips.`
` However, he bit it back down.`
`There could certainly be no words...`
`...to express the many feelings he kept in his chest.`
`So, ...saying anything aloud would probably be crude.`
`Battler understood this, and stopped himself from speaking once more with a resigned smile.`
`"..........................."`
`"......Thank you."`
`"Oh, I have done nothing deserving of your gratitude..."`
`"......I'll leave the rest to you."`
`After seeing {f:5:Virgilia} nod back at him, Battler turned away from the altar one more time...`
`......and left the chapel.`
`{f:5:Virgilia} also disappeared,`
` ......and all disturbances that might have interrupted her blissful sleep were gone...`
`The Inquisitors listened with calm—no, scornful gazes.`
`They listened to the frantic babbling of the maid accused of murdering her master.`
`However, nothing she said could bury the fault in her own alibi.`
`They were all mere emotional arguments.`
`{n}"I loved and respected my master so much. I had no motive for killing him."`
`No matter how much she spoke,`
` it only made her look more and more like the floundering true culprit struggling pathetically.`
`The whodunit and howdunit had been satisfied.`
`{n}As for the whydunit, the motive, the heart—who would care?`
`......No matter how much she spoke of her gratitude for her master, who had graciously fed her and given her a job when she had been left to starve on the streets after various misfortunes,`
` that didn't help her case in the slightest in the mystery genre.`
`Therefore, her motive didn't matter.`
`{n}All of that could just be {i:squeezed out} of the culprit afterwards.`
`An Inquisitor took out a roll of parchment and held it forth, cutting off the maid's sobs and protests.`
`"This is how you committed the crime.`
` Know that this indictment has been received by the Great Court and that your arrest has been approved.`
` Here is the warrant for your arrest.`
` The motive is unnecessary.`
` Know that such a thing is completely extraneous in the matter of pinpointing the culprit.`
` With that in mind, I beg to inform you of the following.`
` Know that we of the SSVD possess methods of forcing unrepentant criminals to reveal the truth."`
`"Be advised that with these interrogation tools blessed by the powers of justice, we Inquisitors will strap up your limbs, burn them, crush them, hang you by them,`
` and thereby wring the red truth out of you.`
` ......It isn't even necessary for you to confess!`
` Aides, arrest that maid!"`
`"It wasn't me! I didn't kill the master...!!`
` N‐no, nooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oo!!"`
`"Hold it right there.`
` You've got the wrong culprit."`
`A man kicked the door open, and the Inquisitors were all shocked at the sight of him.`
`"Wh‐......why are you here?`
` Know that you are no longer in charge of this case...!"`
`"Quiet.`
` You find one person without an alibi and just assume that she's the culprit?`
` Do you really think there's no need for a motive, for a heart, in crime?`
` Crimes are committed by people.`
` There are no crimes without a heart.`
` I'll never accept any theory that ignores the heart."`
`"Kn‐know that your focus on the whydunit is simply embarrassing...!`
` The whydunit is unnecessary!`
` Such a thing can be easily extracted through interrogation!`
` Even the Great Court has already acknowledged that this woman is the culprit...!!"`
`"The Great Court has heard your argument that the maid must be guilty because everyone besides her has an alibi,`
` and they've mistaken your overconfidence and conceit for wisdom.`
` If any one of the other suspects loses their alibi, your evidence so far proves nothing.`
` ......Just look at how pathetic some of these other alibis are.`
` Did the clock in the reception hall chime midnight at exactly the right time?`
` Did the dog by the back door bark at everyone?"`
`"So, you managed to prove the maid's alibi false.`
` Congratulations.`
` But does it end there?"`
`"It may've been possible for her to do it, but does she have any motive at all?`
` Are the alibis for the others absolutely perfect?`
` This maid wasn't the only one with a false alibi.`
` You have to keep on searching if you want to find the others."`
`"Was there some sort of grudge against the victim? Or some money‐related problem?`
` Don't abandon motive, don't abandon the heart.`
` Dry mysteries where the motive can just be figured out later aren't worth anyone's time."`
`"I‐if the maid isn't the culprit, then why did she fake an alibi?!`
` Even asking such a question is a waste of time!`
` Know that we just have to interrogate her, wring out the red truth, and have her sign in red blood to everything that happened at the time of the crime!"`
`"Yeah, you probably can do that.`
` You can just use that torture of yours to squeeze out everything frankly and objectively, as seen from the eyes of God.`
` But you know what?`
` ......I'll never accept mysteries and theories that lack heart."`
`"I, I have already taken over responsibility for this case!!`
` I even have a decree right here!`
` Come now, Aides, know that there is no reason to hesitate!`
` I order you to arrest this maid!!"`
`When she gave this order, her subordinates hesitated, looking back and forth between their superior and that man...`
`"I won't let you.`
` The real culprit's a different person.`
` It's possible to use motive to find them,`
` and the alibi trick's an old one.`
` You can't forget the heart."`
`"Th‐there's no need for that...!!`
` We just have to find the suspicious ones who could have committed the crime, interrogate them, and squeeze out the red truth!!`
` On the off‐chance that they are not the culprit,`
` then we just have to interrogate the next suspect...!!"`
`"You call that reasoning?"`
`"Stand back!!`
` We will arrest that woman!!`
` Know that this maid is the culprit!!"`
`"{p:1:It is forbidden for a servant to be the culprit}!!"`
`"Wh‐`
`what...`
`......did you say.........?!?!"`
`The words of power blasted away the Aides who were trying to arrest the maid.`
`"{p:1:......Van Dine's Twenty Rules, Rule #11}.`
` ......If you want to torture this maid, make sure you double check the alibis for the second wife and her lover first."`
`"Th‐those two already have a clear alibi for the time of the crime...!!"`
`"That, an alibi?`
` Dammit, a fool like you couldn't understand no matter how easy I make it for you.`
` If you want to call yourself a Chief Inquisitor, try and figure out at least that much for yourself.`
` Until then, I'll be taking that maid's arrest warrant."`
`"Th‐then what about you?!`
` Can you prove that this maid didn't commit the crime?!`
` Know that she was clearly away from the kitchen at the time of the crime!`
` What was she doing then, and where?!`
` She can't prove it, I can't prove it, and you can't prove it! No one can!`
` That's why we have no choice but to use these torture devices to interrogate her until the red truth is squeezed out!!"`
`"You can squeeze as much blood and truth from the true culprit as you damn well please.`
` But know this.`
` I won't let you interrogate or torture anyone who isn't that culprit."`
`"Th‐this is why everyone says you're too soft...!`
` All the suspicious must be interrogated!`
` That is how we Inquisitors conduct our witch trials!!"`
`"That's right, we are Inquisitors.`
` Felling evil witches is our job.`
` However, we must not risk hurting the innocent.`
` We must not suspect them...!`
` All humans have their own personal truths.`
` Those should only be exposed when they commit crimes.`
` We've been given the right to expose them.`
` But there's one thing we can't do."`
`"......Wh‐...what......?!"`
`"No one, not even God, has the right to expose the innocent truths of those who have not sinned!!"`
`The maid finally realized that he was trying to protect her.`
`"......I, I don't know who you are, but......`
` Th‐`
`......thank you...`
`...very much...!`
` I'm......really not......the culprit!"`
`"Yeah, I know.`
` ......Your boyfriend said he'd be willing to give up everything to prove your alibi.`
` You should thank him.`
` That kid said that honor and reputation are worth nothing compared to you."`
`"B‐......but, if he does that, he'll......"`
`"It won't come to that.`
` Exposing the secrets between lovers is a job for third‐rate magazines.`
` That's not mystery.`
` ......I'll never allow for heartless reasoning."`
`Then, for the first time, the man's sullen expression relaxed, and he patted the maid's head unreservedly.`
`"......I'm sure you two will be happy together.`
` Still, meeting together in secret while on the job is hardly praiseworthy.`
` Try to keep that to a minimum."`
`"Th‐......thank you so much......`
` Thank you so much......"`
`These words were heard only by the two of them.`
`The man had learned of her innocence, which could only be proven by exposing the secrets of a pair of young lovers, and he had rushed about in search of a solution, resentful of the arrogance of those trying to expose this by forcible means.`
`"The point of theory‐making is not to create a culprit, nor is it to trample the truth in the hearts of the innocent in the process.`
` Heart matters.`
` ......If you want to play the detective, don't forget the heart.`
` Forget that, and we're just intellectual rapists.`
` Don't forget it!!"`
`"Uu......ggh......ggggghhhhh......!!"`
`The Inquisitors couldn't argue back any longer after the man's forceful words.`
`The man's name was Will.`
` But everyone used to call him by a different title.`
`Chief Inquisitor in SSVD, the Eighth District Repentance Enforcement Agency of the Great Court of Heaven—`
`Wizard‐hunting Wright.`
`"That's the last thing I'm leaving behind for you all.`
` If you want to be the next "Wizard‐hunting Wright", remember it.`
` Never forget!!"`
