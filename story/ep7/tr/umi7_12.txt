`The months and years slid by.`
`In my new, more colorful life, I smiled at the spring sunshine peeking through the trees, gazed up at the column of summer clouds,`
` enjoyed the piles of fallen leaves in autumn, and played in the winter snow the few times it did fall.`
`As these days passed one after another, there was a considerable change to my environment.`
`That was a complete rotation in the servants from the Gospel House.`
`There weren't specific grades like in school, so there was no rule saying how long a servant could work before quitting.`
`Each servant made their own decision about when they would "graduate" from Rokkenjima.`
`Some of those who couldn't stand the environment would quit in as little as three days.`
`After all, life on Rokkenjima was strict.`
`It was also strict in the Gospel House, of course, but there were a lot of Rokkenjima‐only rules,`
` and Natsuhi, the one who supervised the servants, was also very authoritarian.`
` It was probably easy to feel constrained.`
`That constrained feeling and the money sat on opposite sides of the scale that they used to decide the time of their graduation.`
`And sometimes, someone from the Ushiromiya family would use their influence to secure someone a new job, encouraging them to spread their wings and start a new life.`
`The cycle usually lasted two or three years.`
`No one decided this, but it was one of the goals most servants shot for, an unspoken rule.`
`However, I was an exception to that rule.`
`I continued to live as a servant while going to school in Niijima......`
`That year, all of the Gospel House servants quit at once.`
`It wasn't at all rare for friends to quit at the same time as each other.`
`All of my fellow servants from the Gospel House graduated from the island at once, leaving only me behind...`
`Of course, I hadn't been on particularly good terms with them.`
`On the contrary, it was annoying to be treated like a kid and called Yasu all the time.`
`Even when new servants had joined,`
` the older ones got them believing that "Yasu loses things all the time",`
` so things had still been unpleasant even then.`
`Those unpleasant older servants, as well as the ones who started at the same time or after I did, all quit at once.`
`The Ushiromiya family had no quarrel with those who left.`
` Adult servants were easier to handle in the first place.`
`The Gospel House servants were only accepted so that they could be trained.`
`So, all of the servants except for me left, and no one tried to stop them......`
`"Later, Yasu.`
` Don't go losing stuff again."`
`"......I don't lose things anymore."`
`"Hmph, later.`
` Make sure you listen to what Madam says.`
` Don't you go troubling the next group of servants."`
`"......You know, it's still a mystery.`
` Why did someone recommend Yasu?"`
`"It's even more surprising that Madam let Yasu stay this long."`
`"Hey, at least the kid's got the guts to not give up and run away.`
` Keep it up, {i:Yasu}."`
`"I, I......hate being called Yasu..."`
`At the very end, ......I finally said the one thing I'd always wanted to say to them.`
`However, they basically ignored me, and just picked up their things and left...`
`"........................"`
`"......Guess you never got a chance to become friends with them."`
`"I wouldn't even want to."`
`"Yep.`
` I'm sure they feel the same way, so you're even.`
` Just forget about those people.`
` They don't have anything to do with you anymore.`
` So, there's no reason to give them any more thought."`
`"............Yeah.`
` ......You're right."`
`I felt just a bit disappointed.`
`I was never able to get them to acknowledge that I'd become a fully‐fledged servant who could take care of myself.`
`"It's hard for people to throw off their first impressions.`
` ......That's just how it is.`
` No matter how wonderful a person you grow into,`
` they would probably always call you Yasu and make fun of you.`
` There's no reason for you to seek their validation."`
`"......Yes.`
` Yeah, you're right, Shannon.`
` I'll completely forget about those people."`
`"Good.`
` You have two great friends, Kumasawa‐san and me.`
` And when the new servants come, you can show them from the start that you can take care of yourself."`
`Shannon was exactly right.`
`I regained a sense of confidence and pride that I hadn't felt since that day when I held the key with the spiderweb charm up high.`
`......I am now the most experienced Fukuin servant.`
`The new servants who come will still probably be older than me,`
` but I need to teach them the ropes as the more experienced servant.`
`Genji‐sama even told me to guide the newer servants...`
`Okay.`
` ......I'll give it my all.`
`"That's the right attitude.`
` Let's give it our all together."`
`"Yeah!"`
`"My name is Asne ({p:0:明日音}).`
` Pleased to meet you."`
`"My name is Belne ({p:0:鐘音}).`
` Pleased to meet you."`
`.....................`
`The newly arrived servants looked......a bit frivolous.`
`When I first joined the Ushiromiya family, I was incredibly nervous.`
`However, I couldn't see any trace of that nervousness on these girls...`
`"Yes.`
` Usually, kids with good grades and behavior were selected."`
`"How are they selected?`
` Who chooses?"`
`"People from the board of directors come and interview them.`
` And other things are considered like their everyday conduct..."`
`"So! As long as they acted like good kids in front of the adults, they could pass?"`
`"......Well,`
` ummm,`
` ......there were times that they passed because the adults thought they looked suitable..."`
`"All of the children who came from the Gospel House were highly individualistic.`
` Their rough edges would be sanded down as they worked as servants,`
` and eventually they would grow to be servants who would not shame the Ushiromiya family."`
`"However, it was the role of the more experienced servants to encourage this model behavior.`
` ......Since I was now the only one with experience, it was my responsibility to guide them."`
`"What were the new kids like?"`
`"Elites, no doubt?!`
` Of irreproachable conduct!"`
`"......I think they were like that when Madam and Genji‐sama were around.`
` However,`
` ......when their superiors weren't around, well,`
` ......they didn't take things quite as seriously..."`
`"Asne‐san...`
` Make sure you put your tools on the cart when you're done using them."`
`"Kyahhahahahaha!`
` ......Huh?`
` Su~re. So~rry."`
`As an experienced servant, I also gave them a warning.`
`"And Belne‐san, you shouldn't set your key down in a place like that.`
` You'll lose it."`
`"I'm not gonna lose it.`
` I never forget where I put things."`
`When I first arrived here, the older servants would often tell me off just as I was doing now.`
`They would probably have been far more mean and obnoxious about it.`
`I had hated that, so I tried to be more gentle when admonishing them, but they wouldn't take me seriously...`
`"L‐listen up.`
` You know there's a witch living in the mansion, don't you...?"`
`"Oooh, {f:5:Beatrice}~!"`
`"Kyahahahaha! That sounded just like him!"`
`"Shannon‐chan,`
` don't tell me you believe in that too?"`
`"Y‐yes, she really exists...`
` If you leave things lying around, the witch will prank you and hide them..."`
`"It's true.`
` It's gotten me into trouble many times..."`
`"A witch hiding things?"`
`"That's totally impossible."`
`"I mean, come on, witches?"`
`"They don't even exist!`
` Kyahhahahahaha!"`
`"They don't exist.`
` ......Witches."`
`"......I thought they were just pranks.`
` No, ......I think it just gave me peace of mind to think of them that way......while I still could."`
`"Do you think the witch {f:5:Beatrice} actually existed...?"`
`"I don't believe it."`
`"......I don't know if it was {f:5:Beatrice},`
` but I do think that something that wasn't human...`
`...really did exist in that mansion."`
`"Do you think there's a chance that this non‐human thing was {f:5:Beatrice}...?"`
`"Ridiculous."`
`"......I wish I could say it was ridiculous."`
`"That must have been a prank of Yasu's. No, not a prank, revenge."`
`"I did think that at first, but......"`
`"Did something happen that couldn't be explained away as a prank...?"`
`"......It was persistent.`
` ......And creepy."`
`"Specifically, what sorts of things happened?"`
`"Things I set down would disappear as soon as I looked away for a second."`
`"Didn't Yasu just hide them?"`
`"I thought so at first.`
` It was only natural to think that.`
` But I started getting this feeling that something wasn't right.`
` I kept thinking...would a timid kid like that really pull such nasty pranks?"`
`"Can you tell us what happened?"`
`"......When my key ring disappeared, it was easy to think that Yasu snatched it when I wasn't looking.`
` ......But when just a single key disappeared off that key ring...`
`and reappeared somewhere impossible, I couldn't think of it that way."`
`"Maybe Yasu just pulled that one key off while you weren't looking...?"`
`"Is that even possible?! Practically speaking?!`
` Quickly hiding the whole ring is one thing,`
` but if you really think about it, taking a single key off a key ring isn't that easy!`
` The keys would jingle and jangle.`
` I was standing right next to them, facing the other way!`
` If someone had taken their time to carefully remove a key when I was that close, even an idiot like me would've noticed!"`
`"But a single key just vanished without a sound.`
` ......At that moment, I finally realized.`
` This wasn't Yasu trying to get back at me,`
` ......it was something...`
`...worse...`
`than that."`
`"And where did you find this disappearing key?"`
`"It was...`
`......in my locker."`
`"Belne, you're such a ditz sometimes...`
` Are you sure you didn't just take that key off yourself and forget that you put it in your locker......?"`
`"Why would I take that one key off the ring?!`
` Have you ever taken a key off your key ring, Asne, or put one on?!`
` I tried doing it myself.`
` It's really stiff!`
` I would never go to all that trouble.`
` There's no point in it!`
` Am I a sleepwalker or something?!`
` How could I not remember something I'd done?!"`
`"I may be stupid, but I'm not that stupid!`
` I don't forget about things I do that easily!!`
` And anyway, I know I had my key with me when I entered the room!`
` Otherwise, how could I have unlocked the door?!"`
`"......Okay then...`
` Being careful not to make any sound,`
` Yasu must have, um,`
` ...slipped the key off,`
` and hid it in your locker..."`
`"That's what I thought at first!`
` I jumped at Yasu, telling that kid not to mess with me!`
` But even as I said it, I realized.`
` Isn't there something completely wrong here?!"`
`"I mean, we were with Yasu the whole time that day as we went around cleaning the rooms, right?!`
` There's no way Yasu had enough time to take a jangly key off the ring!`
` It was impossible for Yasu!`
` In fact, that would have been impossible for anyone, to remove just a single key in that short amount of time without making a sound!!"`
`"M‐maybe the ring was missing a master key when you got it..."`
`"I already told you!!`
` The key really was there in the beginning!`
` I was the one who unlocked that room!`
` So it must have been there!`
` ......And then, I went into the room!`
` I'm an idiot who hates hearing the keys clattering around, so I placed the ring on the bed...!"`
`"Then, when we finished cleaning, I picked up the ring, tried to lock the door, and it was gone!`
` I may have turned my back on the ring, but it was right next to me!`
` So, if someone tried to pull a prank by removing just one key, I'd have heard the clinking!`
` And yet, just the key for that room vanished and appeared again in my locker!!"`
`"......So okay, let's say that Yasu managed to sneak it away.`
` It's less stressful to imagine.`
` ......But still!`
` How could Yasu have put it in my locker, then?!`
` We were together with Yasu the whole time, right?!`
` When I started yelling about it being gone and ran all over the place looking for it, Yasu was with me until the moment I found it in my locker, get it?!"`
`"I'm telling you it's impossible!!`
` Even as I jumped at Yasu, I began to feel it.`
` I mean, Yasu's eyes seemed to be saying it silently.`
` ......According to Yasu, the reason things used to go missing all the time...`
`wasn't because Yasu was forgetful, as everyone said, ......but actually...`
`......because impossible things would suddenly happen, just like they had to me,`
` ......and.........and...!"`
`"......Yasu was with you the whole time, so there was no chance for Yasu to put the key in the locker?"`
`"Did other strange things like that happen?"`
`"Yeah, they did.`
` More stuff went missing, but not just that... Things kept happening, over and over...`
` ......Of course, I started getting nervous and being careful not to just leave stuff lying around, ......but that didn't help."`
`"......At first, I was angry at Yasu,`
` ......but at some point, I began to realize that I was mistaken.`
` One time, a key even disappeared from a ring that was in my pocket!`
` Then, I realized.`
` ......These weren't Yasu's pranks.`
` The same thing that had happened to Yasu was now happening to me...!"`
`"C‐calm down a bit...`
` I think some of those were Yasu's pranks,`
` ...and the others were just you being clumsy.`
` ......It's true that the mansion's always dark and eerie,`
` ......and it does feel like the sort of place you'd find a curse.`
` I'm sure that's what made you scared like that..."`
`"You saw it too, didn't you?!`
` Remember that white shadow we saw vanish into the VIP room that rainy day?!"`
`"......Y‐yes, I saw,`
` but couldn't that just have been Madam or Milady wearing something white...?"`
`"What do you mean, something white?!`
` Have you ever seen either of them wearing something like that?!`
` And besides, that VIP room is always locked!`
` They don't have keys to it!`
` That had to have been some kind of ghost or evil spirit...`
`...no, the silhouette of the witch!"`
`"........................`
` ......Ha...hahaha...`
` So, as you can see, ......Belne started acting like this at one point.`
` Totally scared.`
` ......I've got more street smarts than her,`
` so the more scared she became, the more strongly I felt that this whole thing was stupid and witches couldn't exist."`
`"......Still, I had to be careful about what I said.`
` ......I mean, I was starting to realize that this wasn't something I should talk about carelessly.`
` ......All ghost stories and curses sound stupid to outsiders.`
` ......But to the people who believe in them, it's absolutely not a joking matter.`
` It really was......no joke."`
`"......Asne didn't believe a word of what I said.`
` So, I eventually stopped telling Asne about it......and confessed to Yasu instead.`
` I told Yasu "I thought you were the culprit, but it couldn't have been you".`
` I said that something...`
`...strange...was happening to me...!"`
`"......And what was the reply?"`
`"Yasu said that the same thing had happened many times before, but no one would believe it...!`
` Besides, even though the older servants always made fun of Yasu, I knew that Yasu wasn't as clumsy or stupid as they said."`
`"I hated being bossed around by a younger person, so I always fought back, but Yasu did have the job pretty much down pat.`
` I'd always thought it strange that people made so much fun of Yasu for losing things...!"`
`"I was then sure.`
` It "existed"!`
` Some strange, inhuman thing "existed" in this mansion!"`
`"And that was the witch {f:5:Beatrice}...?"`
`"If {f:5:Beatrice} is what you want to call it, then I believe in {f:5:Beatrice}!`
` Anyway, something that can't be explained away by human actions definitely "existed" there!`
` People who didn't understand kept calling Yasu and me forgetful!`
` They didn't get it... They just didn't get it!!"`
`"......B‐but still,`
` ......you got a little scared, but it spooked you into shaping up, didn't it?`
` And then all that fuss about you losing things went away, right...?`
` So it must have been your imagination all the time......"`
`"You're wrong!!`
` I talked to Yasu, Shannon, and Kumasawa‐san about it!`
` And they said that the witch really did exist...`
` That all the old servants make sure to respect her!"`
`"They said I had been cursed because I'd stupidly gone around saying that {f:5:Beatrice} didn't exist...!`
` So I reformed!`
` Yasu taught me how to give offerings to the doll in the VIP room!`
` I asked Genji‐sama for permission and prayed at the shrine on the reef!`
` And then it all stopped, all at once!!"`
`"You were okay, Asne, since you stopped making fun of the witch,`
` but if you'd cluelessly gone on making fun of her, you would surely have been cursed next!`
` Yes, I guarantee it! You definitely would have been cursed...!!"`
`".........Yeah,`
` .....that kind of stuff makes even me uncomfortable...`
` ......Though I'd never say it to their faces..."`
`"You just don't get it!`
` You really don't!!`
` So, I made sure to teach all the newer servants well!`
` A witch called {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama lives in this mansion...!`
` If you make fun of her, you really will be cursed...!!"`
`".....................Belne..."`
`"When things, you know, ......disappear, that's a sign that the witch is close by and watching us...`
` If you say it's a prank, or that witches aren't real,`
` you'll be cursed even more...!!`
` It was like that for both Yasu and me!`
` Whenever a key vanishes,`
` ......that's a sign that the witch has appeared...!!"`
`Belne‐san carelessly tossed her key ring on the bed again, humming as she started to clean...`
`No matter how much I warn her, she doesn't change her ways.`
` She's always making fun of me and calling me Yasu, so she won't listen to what I tell her......`
`Why won't she listen to what I say...?`
`You mustn't leave things lying carelessly about.`
` If you lower your guard, the witch will prank you......`
`"......Ahyahhyahhya!`
` Look at that delicious key ring lying out there in the open......"`
`"St‐stop it, please...!`
` That's Belne‐san's key!`
` Keep your pranking to me alone.`
` Let the others be......!"`
`"You have become so cautious lately that you are no longer fun.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*, I jest, of course."`
`"Still, how unpleasant these people are, refusing to listen to my friend's kindly advice.`
` Any insult to my friend, I take as an insult to myself...!"`
`"......Are you planning to steal Belne‐san's key...?`
` Please, don't do it...!`
` She'll think I hid it again...!"`
`"She thinks my magic is naught but the work of a child like you...?!`
` *cackle*cackle*, very well, then.`
` I shall simply show her a feat impossible for {y:0:Humans}{n:0:humans} to perform...!"`
`"{i:I shall show her my magic}!!`
` Foolish Belne, if that is your name!`
` You will regret that you did not heed the warnings given you by my friend!`
` This flimsy body of mine will not do the trick! I'm borrowing yours!!`
` It's been too long since I last demonstrated real magic!`
` Let my body return for a spell......to the land of the living!"`
`"Huh?`
` Ah, ..................!"`
`A shiver ran up my whole body like an electric shock.`
`From that moment onwards, ......I couldn't move any part of my body by my own will.`
`Like a moment of shock after a blackout,`
` I could do nothing but accept the fact that I had lost control over my body......`
`All of the cells throughout my body felt tingly.`
` ......It felt as though my body had been transformed into someone else's.`
`......I realized that the witch {f:5:Beatrice} was using my body as a vessel to revive for a short period of time...`
`"......Hmm, very nice.`
` That ticklish feeling of the air on my skin... Having a body is simply wonderful!"`
`Wh‐......what are you trying to do?!`
` Please, don't do anything mean......`
`This time, everything was backwards.`
` My words were spoken inside my heart.`
` And the witch's voice was coming out of my mouth...!`
`"Fear not.`
` I will return your body soon enough.`
` I just need to teach her a lesson with a little prank.`
` However, it will not be one so simple that suspicion could fall on you...!`
` Come, try to remember.`
` Where have you been sleeping?!"`
`Everything went completely white and my mind stopped.`
`Once again, that tingling sensation slid up my body.`
`I could feel it all gather in the fingers of both my hands, ......and come out through my fingertips.`
`It was an incomprehensible,`
` indescribable,`
` ......unknown sensation.`
`My head went blank, and I couldn't think at all.`
`I could do nothing......but abandon my soul to the sensation.`
`I finally understood.`
` This is...`
`......what it's like...`
`to use magic......`
`"Come, try to remember.`
` Where have you been sleeping......?"`
`My fingers moved like a puppet's, and danced around as though I was a conductor—not of music, but of magic.`
`I never knew that having my body move without my control could be so exciting...`
`When Beato lifted my finger as if a string was attached to it,`
` the key ring lying on the bed stood on end.`
`......Belne‐san...didn't notice.`
` ......Neither did Asne‐san.`
`They were fully occupied by their happy chat as they cleaned the room...`
`I doubt that either of them could have dreamed that a witch was right behind them,`
` readying herself to use magic.`
`They could never have imagined...`
`...that the key ring was doing a little dance right behind their backs.`
`It was like an anime fairy tale I'd seen once as a kid.`
`The happy way the keys danced and spun made it look as though they had a will of their own.`
`I could feel the fun of making those keys dance with my fingers wash over me...`
`Yes, this is...pleasure......`
`As I powerlessly watched the witch control me,`
` ......I couldn't help but surrender myself to this new joy called magic......`
`"Whoops, that's no good.`
` If the whole ring disappears, my friend will be suspected again.`
` ......All we need to disappear is...`
`...yes, just the key to this room."`
`Beato controlled my fingers, controlling the magic.`
` ......And thereby controlling the keys.`
`The key ring slumped down on the bed,`
` .........and then just the mansion's master key stood on end.`
`"Well now, what shall I do with this?`
` ......Just erasing it would be terribly dull.`
` So, ............*cackle*cackle*!`
` Why don't I throw it into her locker?!`
` That way, I'll give my friend, who's been working here with her the whole time, a perfect alibi!"`
`"Come, try to remember.`
` Where have you been sleeping?!`
` Yes, it was a warm, dark place..."`
`"The inside of Belne's locker!!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`When Beato snapped her fingers, the key burst and became a gold butterfly.`
`......A gold butterfly...?`
`I see, it's gold because she's the Golden Witch, who gave the Master all of his gold.`
`And butterflies are scared of spiderwebs.`
` ......So, it's a gold butterfly.`
`The minions of the witch {f:5:Beatrice}...are gold butterflies......`
`After flitting into the air, it burst into a shower of gold sparks and disappeared.`
`Then, the vanished key......went to Belne‐san's locker......`
`Though it was far away, in the locker of a changing room, I had a vivid understanding of its new state.`
`It wasn't by sight or by touch.`
`{n}It was by some other sense inside my heart, which couldn't be explained by the five senses.`
`{n}A completely new sensation that I'd never felt before.`
`It was the completely alien concept...called magic.`
`{n}A completely unknown pleasure that left me in a trance.`
`"......It is done, my friend.`
` I shall return this body to you..."`
`Nn, ..................ah......`
`"..........................."`
`It felt as though I had been spinning through space,`
` and gravity had suddenly come back and thrown me to the ground.`
`Like when you're having a great dream, but you're suddenly woken up,`
` ......and all you can remember about the dream was that it was fun.`
` ......That sort of lonely feeling.`
`Though Beato had been borrowing my body, it was my own body that used magic.`
`I could still feel that sensation in my hands.`
`The key ring over there had danced along with the movements of my fingers.`
`No, that's not quite it.`
` The key ring and my fingers had danced together.`
`That fun, that excitement...`
`...still tingled slightly in my hands......`
`"Whoops, that was close."`
`Saying this, Belne‐san suddenly turned around and picked up the key ring she had thrown down on the bed.`
`She must have realized that I was staring at it.`
`"Almost had Yasu complain that I shouldn't leave keys lying about like this.`
` I'd never put something down and forget about it."`
`With a grin, she put the key back into her pocket.`
`However, she still hadn't noticed.`
`She probably couldn't even imagine that during the few moments her guard was down...`
`...just a single key had vanished from the ring...`
`It's not easy for a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} to do things like that.`
`......But, with magic...`
`With just a little dance of the keys and a butterfly popping, ......it had disappeared.`
`"Alright, fingertip inspection!`
` Bed, okay.`
` Curtains, okay!"`
`"Tools, okay.`
` And keys too!`
` See?`
` Nothing wrong, right?"`
`"Y‐yes, that's good......`
` Then let's go on to the next room.`
` ......Ah, ......Belne‐san.`
` Could you......lock up this room for me?"`
`"Hmm?`
` Su~re."`
`.........Did Belne‐san's key...`
`...really disappear by magic?`
`Was that fun magic just a daydream I had......?`
`I was so scared of that being true......that I tested it.`
`"...........................`
` ...............Huh......?"`
`"What's wrong?`
` Why're you taking so long?"`
`".........Huh?`
` .........Huh? Huh??`
` ......Wait, are you kidding me?"`
`"What's wrong...?"`
`"......It's not this one.`
` ......And it isn't this one.`
` ......Huh?`
` What the...?"`
`"What is it?`
` Do you want me to lock it?"`
`"I, I don't get it?`
` What's going on?`
` ......My master key's gone.`
` Just my master key is gone.`
` Wh‐why...?!`
` This ring's so stiff... There's no way it'd come off......!"`
`I could faintly feel that tingling sensation...`
`in the tips of my fingers......`
`That night.`
`......As I gazed at the ceiling from the bed in my dorm room,`
` ......I looked at my hands.`
` I couldn't sleep.`
`The excitement from the time those keys danced was still there in my fingers...`
`Is this...`
`...how {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`...how witches...`
`...always feel?`
`............I have a witch friend called {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}She always used to pull pranks on me with her strange magic.`
`Because I saw this all the time,`
` .........I thought I knew what magic was.`
`But today...`
`.....she had possessed my body......and used magic with it.`
`The sensation of magic that I finally felt at that time......still held my heart entranced.`
`It was a completely unknown pleasure.`
`After all......`
`With a movement of my fingertips,`
` .........the key had danced on command.`
`{n}It was an mysterious, wondrous miracle of magic—something no {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} could do.`
`I still couldn't let go of that excitement...`
`........................`
`".........Shannon.`
` .........Are you awake...?"`
`".....................`
` ......What's up?"`
`Shannon was still awake.`
`Shannon is always early to bed, early to rise.`
` By getting to bed early, all of her weariness disappears by the next day.`
`......She lives a model life, one that all servants should respect and admire.`
`......If I wanted to become a beloved and respected servant like Shannon,`
` .........I would need to act that way too.`
`However, ......I had no confidence that I could do that anymore.`
`"I guess...`
`.........I can't become like you after all."`
`"......What do you mean?`
` This is a bit abrupt."`
`"You were my ideal.`
` Always."`
`".........Yeah."`
`"At the Gospel House, you were kind to everyone and loved by everyone.`
` ......You would always play with me, and you were my only friend.`
` And at the Ushiromiya mansion, you were a wonderful servant, who could carry out any task flawlessly and gracefully.`
` My idol and goal.`
` ......That's what you were."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Let's give it our all together.`
` As they say, perseverance prevails.`
` You're gaining recognition from everyone now.`
` So let's aim to become wonderful servants together."`
`"..................`
` ......I'm...done with being a servant."`
`"......Huh?"`
`"Instead of a servant,`
` ......I think it'd be more fun to be a witch."`
`"A, a witch...?`
` ...What do you mean...?"`
`"A servant who everyone loves and relies upon is...`
`...yeah, it's still something I'd love to be.`
` ......But right now,`
` .........I want to be a witch...`
`even more."`
`"Well, that's...`
`...ummm...`
` .........Huh......?"`
`Shannon was confused.`
`It was hardly surprising.`
` ......All this about quitting as a servant was at least understandable.`
`But she didn't know how to answer after hearing that her roommate wanted to become a witch...`
`"A witch.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......You see, today, {f:5:Beatrice} possessed me and used my body to do magic.`
` That unknown world felt so......thrilling.`
` It was far, far more thrilling than even the time I learned that I'd been selected as an Ushiromiya family servant."`
`"It was like learning about a new world.`
` ......As though I'd been living in a world of darkness all my life and thought I knew what the world was like,`
` then finally learned what light was and saw the world for the first time.`
` It was...joy.`
` ......Excitement."`
`At that time, Beato had only used my fingers, made a key ring dance,`
` and turned a key into a butterfly before hiding it in a locker.`
`But I had understood it with my body.`
`If I had moved my fingers a different way, the ring could have flown into the air instead of just dancing,`
` and I could have turned it into a scurrying lizard instead of a butterfly. ......I could have done anything.`
`True, {f:5:Beatrice}'s magical power was still weak.`
`It had all happened in the little world behind the backs of the servants filled with the anti‐magic toxin.`
`However, inside that tiny, short‐lived world, I could have done anything at all.`
`{n}Beato just happened to settle on making the keys dance and turning one into a butterfly.`
`{n}But if she wanted to, she could have done anything else!`
`The endless sensation of that free, unrestricted power...`
`{n}I could still feel it in my fingertips.`
`Could it be that, along with that sensation, a sliver of that magical power might also remain...?`
`I can tell.`
` It's still there.`
` .........There's still just a bit of it there, along with that sensation.`
`I can do it.`
` ......I can still.........do it......`
`"............Ah......"`
`A single spot of golden light suddenly lit up in this dark room.`
`{n}It was right between my clasped hands.`
`When I slowly opened them,`
` ......I could see a single dot that sparkled gold.`
`"What...`
`......is...`
`......?"`
`Shannon didn't know what the light meant.`
`How could light appear from the palms of my hands?`
`And yet, even with this miracle right in front of her,`
` ......she couldn't understand what it was.`
`She just sat there with her mouth open in disbelief.`
`However, to me,`
` ......this was just the return of that bit of sensation in my fingertips.`
`The golden dot...`
`...spread out...`
`...and became a small, gold butterfly.`
`It flapped its wings and scattered gold sparks about like Tinker Bell.`
`To Shannon, it probably just looked as though a gold butterfly was flapping its wings.`
`......Of course, that alone was a miracle that she could hardly grasp.`
`But to me, it was like a remote‐control plane in the shape of a butterfly.`
`{n}I could control that gold butterfly however I wanted.`
`Not clumsily with threads.`
`{n}......I could make it flap, dance, play through the air as I wished.`
`I was taking a walk through the air as that little butterfly.`
`The golden glint of it pierced the darkness of the small room as it danced about freely.`
` ......It was an entrancing pleasure.`
`......However, that sensation in my fingers began to weaken.`
`I could tell that the few magic butterfly scales left in my fingers were going away.`
`Finally, like a sparkler burning out, the gold butterfly gave out one last blink of light,`
` fell down as a single golden dot, and disappeared without a trace......`
`"Wh‐what on Earth just happened......"`
`"This is magic.`
` .........It's really fun."`
`"M‐.........magic............"`
`"Yeah.`
` Magic.`
` ......I was able to use it just now because there was still a little left in my fingers.`
` ......But if I became a real witch, ......I'd be able to use it whenever and however I wanted......to do anything.`
` Now that I've learned how fun this can be,`
` I don't want to go back to being {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` Being a servant is just too boring.`
` So, ......I'm going to become a witch."`
`"B‐become a witch...`
` ............W‐wait......!"`
`"I've already made my decision, Shannon.`
` It's been fun.`
` I'll give you this room.`
` You can use it by yourself.`
` Later.`
` Goodbye."`
`"W‐wait...!!"`
`As Shannon called out repeatedly for me to wait, ......a massive planetarium swallowed me up.`
`In the sea of the pitch‐black starry sky, I was alone.`
` I...we...are alone here.`
`"I'm done acting the part of a servant.`
` .........I'm going to...modify the world."`
`".........Mm.`
` Understood.`
` In that case, how would you like it to be?"`
`"Being a wonderful servant like Shannon wouldn't be bad.`
` ......But now that I know how fun it is to be a witch, that feels like a boring dream.`
` I can't go back anymore."`
`"What will happen to Shannon?"`
`"......Shannon can just be Shannon, and stay as a respected servant.`
` She'll stay the same.`
` But from now on, it won't be the two of us together, but her alone."`
`"Partings can be so sudden.`
` ......Ah, well.`
` Being fickle makes life more entertaining.`
` Then what will you do instead?"`
`"I want to be a witch.`
` I want to be Beato."`
`"But I am already {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"Your backstory that you're a witch and my friend will remain the same,`
` but I'll modify the world so that Beato is me."`
`"Would I then be a witch who is a friend of {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"Pretty much.`
` So, from now on, you're a different witch."`
`"Very well.`
` Then, what will be my new name?"`
`".....................`
` I'll put that on hold until I can think of one.`
` You'll be nameless for a while.`
` Sorry about that."`
`"Worry not, worry not.`
` It is to be my name, after all.`
` You had better take your time and think carefully about it.`
` *cackle*."`
`"You'll be {f:5:Beatrice}'s friend that she's had since she was young and couldn't use magic yet.`
` It started with you hiding my things to tease me."`
`"I see.`
` And when {f:5:Beatrice} finally learns magic, I become a friend on an equal footing with her.`
` So, I should act like a big sister sort of friend."`
`"Yeah, like that.`
` ......What should we do about how we talk?"`
`"It seems that "warawa" has become firmly established as the way {f:5:Beatrice} refers to herself.`
` Should I relinquish that to you?"`
`"Yeah.`
` That haughty way of speaking with "warawa" will be mine."`
`"Hmm, very well.`
` Then I shall—no, I can't speak like that any more.`
` ......Then I need to find a good way to sound like {f:5:Beatrice}'s big‐sister‐like witch friend."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Or should it be...`
`.........very well."`
`"Ahahahaha.`
` Now there's a nice, dignified voice."`
`"What about the way I—let's try that again.`
` And what of my appearance?"`
`"Good point.`
` I've got a sort of blood‐red witch look.`
` Why not choose a different color for yourself?"`
`"......When {f:5:Beatrice} wanders the mansion at night, she is often seen dressed in white."`
`"Of course, ghosts are classically white."`
`"A white dress...`
`...on a witch......`
` .........Let's try putting it all together."`
`I need a different look than the witch in the demon‐red dress.`
`{n}A white, noble witch.`
`......Unlike the time with the red witch, I'm thinking about my own look now,`
` ......so I'd like to make it beautiful and......cute if I can.`
`A white dress.`
` A noble look.`
`{n}Like one of noble blood, but with a dark, sarcastic streak......`
`No, she's like a tomboy princess, so her voice is a mix of formality and rudeness.`
`Then the dress should be the exact opposite, pure and clean, to make a nice contrast......`
`"..............................`
` ......How does this form suit me?"`
`"Is this the form of the new {f:5:Beatrice}?!"`
`"How beautiful!`
` Just like a noble princess!"`
`"Hmmm...`
` ...I've taken a liking to this form.`
` Not bad at all."`
`"......Looking good.`
` That's wonderful, Beato."`
`"Hmm. I like it.`
` I truly do like this form..."`
`"Now, if you can keep this up and give me a wonderful name, that'd be great.`
` If I have to go around nameless for too long, I'll get all sulky."`
`"Fear not, I shall find you a splendid name!`
` But first, there is something I must consider: what shall be the form of my magic?!"`
`"Hiding objects and transporting them instantaneously is your theme.`
` So, I must think of my own particular theme of magic.`
` ......When I use magic, gold butterflies will flit about.`
` I'm not backing down on that part...!"`
`"*giggle*. Splendid.`
` Just perfect for the Golden Witch.`
` ......Then the weaknesses such as spiderwebs and the sacred mirror in the shrine will also go to you?"`
`"Hmm.`
` Even an all‐powerful witch needs a few small weaknesses to keep things interesting.`
` Then let us do it like so.`
` If I touch a spiderweb, it will burn me."`
`Silently, a silvery spider dropped down vertically.`
`Beato, now in her new form, lightly touched the silver spiderweb that trailed out behind it.`
`As she did, ......there was a faint sound of flesh burning, and a thin burn was left across her fingers.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} can't stand spiderwebs.`
`{n}That was one of the weaknesses of the evil spirits Kumasawa‐san spoke of.`
`Since the witch {f:5:Beatrice} had revived thanks to the power of those evil spirits,`
` she also inherited their weaknesses.`
`So, the sacred mirror is also one of her weaknesses.`
`......However, I am unlikely to cross paths with that sacred mirror in the shrine very often.`
`That's not very fun.`
`".........Then, while mirrors with sacred power will obviously be a weakness, let us make mirrors in general a weakness too."`
`"They do often say that mirrors have magical powers.`
` Good idea, I think.`
` Sounds just like a witch."`
`"Let us say that I cannot abide mirrors because when I look at one, it feels as though my magical power is being sucked out.`
` Hmm, that sounds quite entertaining."`
`......Now that I really think about it,`
` I'll be bad with mirrors whether I invent a story for it or not.`
`No matter who I want or strive to be,`
` ......the only face that will ever show in a mirror...`
`is the heartlessly pathetic and realistic face of {i:"Yasu"}.`
`Mirrors, which will always force me to face my shabby reality, are something I always want to avoid.`
`That's right.`
` ......I hate mirrors.`
`......I don't want to look at...`
`my own...`
`pitiful self.`
`"You don't need to decide everything at once.`
` It's fun to build up a world one little bit at a time."`
`"True.`
` I understand.`
` I shall enjoy life as a witch as I slowly expand my world."`
`"That tiny, dark room is no place for you to sleep now."`
`"Indeed.`
` I am the Golden Witch!`
` I am the ruler of Rokkenjima's night, and the nighttime mansion belongs to me.`
` That is where I should be living, is it not?"`
`"A room for {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` Haha, isn't it obvious?!"`
`"Yeah, that's right!`
` That wonderful room on the second floor of the mansion......"`
`"The VIP room of the witch—{i:that} is {f:5:Beatrice}'s room!"`
`"Oh, so it is.`
` From this evening forward, that room in the nighttime mansion shall be my dwelling place...!`
` Why didn't I think of that myself, hahaha, heha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!!"`
`"Then let's go, Beato.`
` If we're going to drink tea together, we'll need a much better room than that cramped one."`
`"Indeed.`
` That room is too crude to welcome friends to and serve tea in.`
` We shall change rooms.`
` Let us go, my friend...!"`
`".........So, this is goodbye to Shannon."`
`When I looked at my feet, ......I could see my own dorm room far beneath me.`
`I could see Shannon, who had dashed up to the bed I lay on and had been saying "wait" at the moment time froze.`
` She was as rigid as a doll.`
`Looking down at it from this height, it really did look like a small dollhouse...`
`"Farewell, Shannon.`
` ......The days I spent as a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, growing our friendship as I attempted to emulate you, were truly fun.`
` ...If I had never learned the joys of magic and awakened as a witch,`
` everything would doubtless have remained as it was."`
` .........I was your only close friend as well, wasn't I?`
`{n}Please forgive me for erasing that friend so suddenly.`
`As a parting gift, ......I will erase "me" from your world.`
`Starting now, this will not be a two‐person room.`
`It will be a single‐person room, with just you in it.`
`Strive to be a kind, reliable servant loved by everyone,`
` and embody that ideal as you always have.`
`Yasu, the stupid, clumsy servant who lost things all the time, no longer exists.`
`Farewell, Shannon.`
`When I mature as the witch {f:5:Beatrice} and wander freely about the nighttime mansion,`
` ......I may bump into you as you do your nighttime rounds.`
`However, when I meet you again,`
` it will not be a reunion.`
`{n}It will be our first meeting.`
`After all, though you have heard the rumors about the witch {f:5:Beatrice}, you have never met her......`
`Farewell, Shannon.`
`Let us meet again sometime and spin up some fun tale.........`
`"Wait......!!`
` Wai...`
`.........t...`
`............`
` ..........................."`
`....................................`
`.........What...`
`...was I doing...?`
`Was I......talking in my sleep......?`
`Apparently, I had gotten out of bed, stretched my hand out towards it,`
` ......and said "wait".`
`This isn't the first time I've woken myself up by saying something strange in my sleep, but...`
`......I don't remember ever waking up to find myself out of bed and standing up.`
`Could this be what they call......sleepwalking...?`
`Am I just tired......?`
`......Gotta sleep.`
` Gotta get back to sleep.`
`I turned around to face my bed.`
`............?`
`My bed wasn't there.`
`{n}There was no bed in this room except the one I had just turned my back on.`
`If I'm the only one in this room, and the only bed is the one behind me,`
` ......that must mean it's my bed.`
`......That feels wrong, for some reason.`
`The bed sheets are all disarranged, as though someone slipped out of them.`
`"Someone"...?`
` This is my own, single‐person room.`
`So, that there is my bed, and the rumpled sheets mean...`
`that I was just sleeping there until a second ago, don't they...?`
`......But, for some reason,`
` .........that bed...`
`...doesn't feel like my bed.`
`But I, Shannon, have a single‐person room—I was the only person to be given one while all the other kids had to share.`
`So, there's only one bed.`
`{n}And it must be mine.`
`...........................`
`".........Am I just...`
`...tired?`
` ......I wonder..."`
`I must just be half‐asleep.`
` I have school again first thing tomorrow.`
`And after school, I'll go to the mansion, help out with some work,`
` and then I want to talk to Kumasawa‐san about the mystery novel I just read.`
`"Time to sleep.`
` I'm probably just so worn out that I'm imagining things.`
` .........Good night, Shannon.`
` Just crawl in bed and close your eyes...`
`...and you won't have to think about anything complicated......"`
`I went back into my bed.`
`It felt a bit uncomfortable to crawl into a bed that wasn't mine.`
`Still, it might just be because I'm getting so sleepy, but it's starting to feel as though this is my bed after all.`
`.........I'm just half‐asleep......`
`I am...Shannon.`
` A lonely servant.`
`I mess up from time to time,`
` ......but I want to become a kind servant whom everyone loves......`
`.........Goodnight,`
` .........me.........`
` Oh, I am one yet many.`
`I have grown tired of playing the servant.`
` I have grown tired of playing the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}!`
`From this moment forth, from this night forth, I am {f:5:Beatrice}!`
`The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}, who has lived for a thousand years!`
`Praise me, servants.`
` Have fear when you are chosen for the night shift!`
`On the nighttime island, the mansion is my place, and that is my time...!`
`Oh, I am one yet many!`
`Yes, let our world swallow up everything.`
` It is like the raging seas!`
`Well now, let us drink the mysterious moon dry tonight, with this {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} book as a side dish!`
`You call this mystery?`
` You call this a locked room?`
` You call this "a crime impossible for {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s"?`
`Don't make me laugh!`
` With all these holes and weak points, you call this a crime impossible for {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s?!`
`Is there no splendid locked‐room magic capable of astonishing me?`
`Oh, not here, not there, not this, not that, all of them pathetic!`
`It draws out a chuckle, but leaves me unsure which is the side dish, the moon or the book?!`
`If I get tired of mystery, I can change myself into a butterfly!`
` I can flit about the island,`
` the mansion, the vast forest at will!`
` I'll follow those cowardly servants as they do their nighttime rounds,`
` and when they check to see that a window is locked, they'll see me laughing at them in the reflection on the glass!`
`I can be fickle, and do as I please!`
`Pranks at night will probably be a lot of fun.`
`Yes, my mind is made up—I will play like that starting tonight!`
`*cackle*cackle*, how pleasurable!`
` Tonight will truly be pleasurable!`
`In the world of witches, the only limits to your fun are the limits of your imagination!`
`My imagination shall become the source of my magical power!`
`Very well, then—this will be fun!`
` I shall allow my imagination to grow without bound.`
` And with it, I shall swallow up the entire island.`
` All nights on this island belong to me!!`
`Oh, how refined and pleasant are the days of a witch!`
`Oh, I am one yet many!`
` Kiha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}hha, hyahhaha!!`
`Here's to the wonderful world of witches!!`
