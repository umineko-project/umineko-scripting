`"So, did you figure out...`
`...who killed Beatrice?"`
`"Yeah.`
` More or less."`
`"I hope you're not going to suggest...`
`...that the head killed her..."`
`"{f:5:Bernkastel} isn't asking about the two Beatrices involved with Kinzo.`
` She's talking about who killed the 1986 {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......I'm not really sure what you mean by "this year's {f:5:Beatrice}".`
` What's all this about a witch called {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` You've mentioned a ghost story, you've mentioned an epitaph...`
` Isn't it about time you explained all this to me?"`
`"Alright.`
` No point stringing you along."`
`"Let's start from the beginning.`
` ......Who is this witch {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"Strictly speaking, it isn't a person.`
` "{f:5:Beatrice}, the Golden Witch" is the name of a concept."`
`"You mean the ghost stories themselves?"`
`"To be more specific, even the ghost stories are only one of the elements that create the concept."`
`"You've lost me."`
`"Ghost stories are normally told in the third person or second person.`
` However, someone started telling those in the first person."`
`"You mean someone started saying that they were {f:5:Beatrice} themselves...?"`
`"The legend of Rokkenjima's evil spirits, and the made‐up story for keeping kids out of the forest...`
` These were combined with Kinzo's constant cries of "Beatrice, Beatrice" and gradually became the legend of the witch.`
` Ushiromiya Maria became entranced by that fictional witch and begged for a chance to meet her.`
` And then, someone...`
`{i:granted her wish}."`
`".........I'm still not following, but I'll just nod and tell you to keep going.`
` ......What do you mean by "granted her wish"?"`
`"Because of the unfortunate way in which Ushiromiya Maria was brought up, she became obsessed with the occult.`
` ......Someone felt sympathy for her, acted the part of {f:5:Beatrice}, and played with her."`
`Maria tends to recognize people by their behavior instead of their physical appearance.`
`When Rosa becomes violent, Maria calls her "the black witch", and at these times, Maria views her as a different person, not her mother.`
`So,`
` this means that she tends to think of the same person as different people depending on their behavior.`
`We can use this to see the scene where Maria first met {f:5:Beatrice} in a new light.`
`After being chased out of the mansion by the adults, Maria decided to drink some tea in the rose garden.`
`At that time, someone probably started talking to Maria.`
`Then, ......when they heard this occult‐loving girl talking happily about how she wanted to meet the witch {f:5:Beatrice},`
` .........this person acted as though {f:5:Beatrice} was possessing them.`
`On the outside, they didn't look like {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`However, when their manner of speech and behavior changed abruptly, Maria would recognize them as a different person.`
`That's why "her" appearance was so sudden.`
`"We can probably view Maria's love of witches and the occult as a form of escapism.`
` ......She believed the power of witches could change her unfulfilling and incomplete life.`
` So, she {i:wanted} to believe in them.`
` Because if she believed in witches, she could also believe in her own happiness."`
`"......It's true that Aunt Rosa is bringing up Maria by herself, and that she's always busy with work.`
` I do feel sorry for Maria, but still..."`
`"Don't ignore the heart.`
` ......So, Maria believed {i:for the sake of believing}.`
` She believed in {f:5:Beatrice}'s simple conjuring trick from the bottom of her heart.`
` That probably comforted her a lot.`
` ......And at that moment, the witch {f:5:Beatrice} was born."`
`"Someone saw that Maria‐chan wanted to meet a witch, so they decided to play witches with her...?"`
`"That's right."`
`This marks the birth of Beato the Elder.`
`All of that about living a thousand years and being bound to Rokkenjima.`
`That was all the result of mixing the legend of Rokkenjima's evil spirits with the story of a ghost wandering the mansion at night.`
`As Furudo Erika guessed, the two ghost stories fused.`
`Someone fused the two stories together and acted the part.`
`So, {f:5:Beatrice} held traits from both ghost stories: she was the master of the mansion's night, while also fearing spiderwebs.`
`"So, when {f:5:Bernkastel} asks us who killed {f:5:Beatrice},`
` she means who killed the kind person who pretended to be {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"That's close, but not quite.`
` It's not the one who pretended.`
` We're talking about two different people.`
` ......In Maria's eyes, just like how her mother and the black witch are different people,`
` {f:5:Beatrice} and the person who played that part are also different people."`
`It's just like Mariage Sorcière.`
`That was where one person would be the creator, and the other person would acknowledge those creations, thereby nurturing the illusion.`
`The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} was also created by one person, and then nurtured when Maria acknowledged her.`
`"You mean, even if you kill the acted character, that doesn't mean you've killed the kind person who was playing the part?"`
`"Even if {f:5:Beatrice}'s vessel is lost, that isn't the same as {f:5:Beatrice} being killed."`
`"......It's easier to understand if we use a telephone as an example.`
` Let's say I call you on the phone.`
` From my perspective during the call, the phone is you, in the sense that it is what I talk to."`
`"But what if I destroy the phone?"`
`"......I see.`
` If you kill the phone, you won't be able to talk to me, but that doesn't mean you've killed me."`
`"We know Maria once offered to let {f:5:Beatrice} possess her, early on in their relationship.`
` That clearly shows that {f:5:Beatrice} did not look like the portrait at that time."`
`"So, if the person acting the part and the witch character they play are different people, ......we're talking about killing just the witch character itself.`
` ......Is that even possible?"`
`"Only the actor can kill the character.`
` In other words, the person who killed {f:5:Beatrice} is the person who played the part of {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"You mean that the person who played witches with Maria‐chan is the culprit {f:5:Bernkastel}'s talking about?"`
`"That's it.`
` .........But, as if this wasn't confusing enough, this chapel is now a world inside a cat box.`
` The culprit is the cat, and there are now two cats existing at the same time—one alive, and one dead."`
`"......Confusing is right.`
` I'm still lost, but keep going.`
` You're saying that there are two culprits?"`
`"Right.`
` ......The person who can create and kill {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`...and the person who never gave birth to {f:5:Beatrice} in the first place, who can kill the entire concept of {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Both of those people are here."`
`"Then let me ask.`
` In this {f:5:Beatrice} murder case,`
` who are the two culprits?"`
`"Let's start with...`
`...the dead cat."`
`"Who is it?"`
`"You."`
`"Wha`
`......`
`......?"`
`"The logic is extremely simple.`
` Your world is the only one where the witch {f:5:Beatrice} doesn't exist."`
`"I don't understand."`
`"Both Maria and Jessica told me stories about the witch {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` However, when they talked about the ranking system at the dining table, you weren't there."`
`"I...wasn't there...?"`
`"Maria came to visit Rokkenjima with Rosa.`
` And Rosa was sitting next to her.`
` That's impossible.`
` .........If you exist, then after Rosa comes you, then Jessica, then Maria."`
`There should be two people between Rosa and Maria in rank.`
`In that case, they should be across the table from each other and separated by one seat.`
`......In other words, in the world where Lion exists, it's impossible for Maria to be sitting next to Rosa.`
`"It was the same in Jessica's story.`
` If you're included in the ranking, then when looking down the table towards Kinzo's seat, you should be on the left side and Jessica should be on the right.`
` After that comes George on the left side and Ange on the right.`
` ......Jessica and Ange will be sitting next to each other whether you're there or not.`
` However, which side of the table they're sitting on changes."`
`In the world where Lion exists, Ange's seat is on Jessica's left.`
`{n}However, if Lion doesn't exist, then Ange's seat is on Jessica's right.`
`"Every time someone talked about the witch {f:5:Beatrice} of 1986, they were all talking about a world where you don't exist.`
` And, in your world, there are no ghost stories about a witch.`
` To you, "Beatrice" is either Kinzo's mistress or his benefactor, not a wandering ghost."`
`"The head loved Beatrice deeply, did he not?`
` I can't imagine why she would be made into a ghost story."`
`"Exactly.`
` If you exist, the witch {f:5:Beatrice} doesn't.`
` Your existence...`
`...{i:kills {f:7:Beatrice}}."`
`"Are you saying I'm the culprit who killed {f:5:Beatrice}......?`
` That's......just crazy.`
` How can I be the culprit if I don't even understand her and have never met her?"`
`"Flip it around.`
` ......If you don't exist, {f:5:Beatrice} will be born."`
`"Flip it?`
` Are you trying to say {f:5:Beatrice} and I are two sides of a coin?"`
`"That's a good way to put it.`
` That's it exactly.`
` You're a coin, and {f:5:Beatrice} is on the other side."`
`"I don't get it at all."`
`"At first, I didn't get your existence either.`
` ......But, I have formed a theory about you, after hearing all this.`
` The important fact is that you're 19 years old."`
`"......I don't remember telling you my age, but you got it right.`
` ......How?"`
`"Jessica said you were already the student council vice‐president when she started, and that you became the president the next year.`
` That means you're one year older than Jessica."`
`Jessica is 18 years old, .........so Lion must be 19.`
`"I see...`
` And what sort of theory can you make, now that you know I'm 19?"`
`"You aren't Ushiromiya Natsuhi's child, that's the theory."`
`"...........................`
` ......How rude.`
` I don't know what game you're playing, but I demand that you take back that slanderous insult to both me and my mother."`
`"Why are you the successor to the headship, instead of Krauss?"`
`"I will succeed the headship when I come of age.`
` When I have a kid, I'll probably pass the title down to them when they come of age."`
`"Then why didn't Kinzo give the headship to Krauss when he came of age?"`
`".........You heard what our head said.`
` He was used by the cunning elders of the Ushiromiya family and suffered much.`
` That's why he decided that only young people should inherit the headship from now—"`
`"In the world without you in it, the silver ring for the successor to the headship doesn't even exist.`
` ......That silver ring on your finger proves that Kinzo has a strong desire to see that you become the next head,`
` a desire which does not manifest in any other world."`
`"......I can't deny that you may have a point there.`
` The head always seemed to adore me particularly.`
` I was told from a young age that I would succeed the headship at once when I became an adult, and that it was very important for me to keep up with my studies in preparation for that day."`
`"......But I don't think my father was any less talented.`
` Why did Grandfather skip over him and make me the successor?`
` .........I've thought it strange from time to time, but since it's always been that way, I never said so aloud."`
`"Do you know why Kinzo wanted you and not Krauss to become the next head?"`
`"How could I know?`
` .........Are you trying to tell me to stop ignoring the heart again?`
` Tell me, what deduction can you make about how the head's heart works?"`
`"It's because you're the child of Kinzo and Beatrice."`
`"......Well done.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`There was a crisp applause and a mocking laugh.`
`"{f:5:Bernkastel}."`
`"......That was faster than I expected.`
` I thought you'd let me play a bit longer."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} appeared sitting on the altar,`
` ......almost as though it had become her own personal chair.`
`"When did you realize that Lion shared Beatrice's blood?"`
`"As soon as I realized that Lion was 19.`
` ......It was the same number as "the baby from 19 years ago", that hint which appeared in the fifth game."`
`"......Didn't that baby fall off a cliff?"`
`"Lion is the baby who was accepted by Natsuhi and didn't fall off the cliff.`
` In other words, if Natsuhi rejects the baby, Lion doesn't exist."`
`"You're saying......I'm not Mom's child...?!`
` That's insane......`
` ....................."`
`"You say that, but you don't look too sure.`
` ......*giggle*.`
` That's right.`
` Ushiromiya Lion is not Natsuhi's child.`
` This is the grown‐up version of the baby Kinzo got from somewhere 19 years ago."`
`"Not "somewhere".`
` ......Lion clearly shares Beatrice's blood.`
` The proof is the silver ring, which is only ever given to Lion across all of the many worlds."`
`"Why does the ring prove that I share Beatrice's blood?"`
`"In all of the many worlds, you are the only one who is given it.`
` That means that, in all worlds, you are the most important person to Kinzo, second only to Beatrice.`
` And his love for you is far greater than it is for his son, Krauss, or his granddaughter, Jessica.`
` And you are 19 years old.`
` ......In other words, if we look back to see what happened 19 years ago, we are led to one theory."`
`"19 years ago?`
` What's supposed to have happened at the time I was born?"`
`".........You heard it too, didn't you?`
` Today, even.`
` Will was with you."`
`"........................`
` ......You don't mean...Aunt Rosa's story?!"`
`"That's right.`
` Rosa's story came out in the third game, and when the age of the baby in the fifth game matched that date, a certain theory became possible.`
` The fact that Kinzo brought a baby from somewhere and tried to add it to his family...`
`proves that the baby was somehow important to him."`
`"I'm...`
`...the Kuwadorian Beatrice's...`
`...child......"`
`"The Kuwadorian Beatrice was the daughter of the Beatrice who came in the submarine.`
` ......But Kinzo didn't think of her as a daughter.`
` He believed she was the same person, Beatrice reborn.`
` ......When that "reincarnation" reached the same age as the first Beatrice, and truly looked like Beatrice's double,`
` ......Kinzo made a terrible mistake."`
`".........I...I don't want to hear it!"`
`"That's how it is.`
` Kinzo got Beatrice pregnant with Beatrice,`
` and then he got that Beatrice pregnant with you.`
` ......So, you're both Kinzo's child and Beatrice's grandchild."`
`"...........................!"`
`"If we consider Kinzo's heart, this is the inevitable theory we reach for explaining why he treated you so specially.`
` He regretted his mistake so badly that he attempted to have you formally accepted into the Ushiromiya family as a descendant."`
`"......In almost all cases, Natsuhi's pride is brutally hurt, and she refuses to raise you.`
` Because of that, you almost always fall from the cliff and disappear."`
`".........I, I was told that after their marriage,`
` ......I was born after much hardship,`
` ......and Jessica was born the next year..."`
`"If you really never suspected that Natsuhi wasn't your mother,`
` ......then you should thank her in this world.`
` The reason you never realized the truth is because she's shown as much affection for you as she did for Jessica."`
`".........There's no need to thank her.`
` ......After all, it took a staggering amount of effort just to find a fragment with you in it."`
`"Mathematically speaking,`
` there's actually a {nobr:2,578,916/2,578,917} chance of her refusing to raise you.`
` You should probably be thanking me for creating this miracle, not Natsuhi.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*."`
`"Enough with your stupid probability games."`
`"Oh, I'm sorry."`
`"...................................."`
`"No matter whose blood you bear, that doesn't change the debt you owe to the family that raised you."`
`"I realize that.`
` ......Still, I would like some time to calm down and think things through.`
` ...That is, if you'll do me the kindness of not ignoring my heart."`
`".........Sure."`
`Lion took a deep breath and looked upwards.`
`......Anyone would be shocked...`
`to find that their parents weren't who they believed them to be.`
`But all the same, Lion, ...you're allowed to feel grateful.`
` Grateful to the family who raised you and met your every need...`
`"It is pretty interesting.`
` ......Hard to believe that the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} might've lived such an ordinary life,`
` even at absurdly low probabilities."`
`"Isn't it?`
` I think moments like this are hilarious......"`
`Will had said it plainly.`
`Ushiromiya Lion......is how the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} appears in a different world.`
`The baby Natsuhi rejected 19 years previous.`
`If she accepts that child, this is the future that results...`
`However, if she does not accept it, ......a witch is born.`
`The baby whose birth was not celebrated becomes a witch...`
`"Lion is the dead cat.`
` ......However, Lion's existence has nothing to do with what you're interested in, the Rokkenjima Serial Murders.`
` ......In other words, Lion is the cat that disappears when you open the cat box."`
`".........*giggle*, exactly.`
` Lion is just a disappearing cat.`
` But this was a pretty entertaining diversion, don't you think?"`
`"You're the only one who finds it entertaining.`
` ......If I wasn't trapped in here, I wouldn't have bothered to reason this out."`
`".....................`
` ......I think I know why I was chosen to be your partner in this strange detective game.`
` ......It seems this {f:5:Bernkastel} witch...`
`enjoys toying with people's fates and making a mockery of them."`
`"Wow, incredible.`
` ......It's rare for someone to understand me the same day they meet me.`
` ......*giggle*."`
`"Apparently, ......I become something that's called a witch in another world.`
` And, apparently, I'm the cause of some sort of crime.`
` Is that my sin to bear?"`
`"Of course it isn't.`
` You are you.`
` How things would be if the coin were flipped the other way shouldn't matter a bit."`
`"Thank you.`
` Even so, to be told that I caused some sort of trouble in a world of a different fate...`
` I don't think anyone would be pleased to hear that.`
` ......Please, tell me.`
` What do I do in that other world?"`
`"............{f:5:Bernkastel}?"`
`"You have the fragments... Why not show them?"`
`"..............."`
`Will opened his hand...`
`and something that looked like a pale‐blue, glowing shard of crystal appeared there.`
`It contained the memories—no, the records—of all the games so far.`
`"......Touch this.`
` You'll be able to see your fate in other worlds."`
`"...............I'll be happier not touching it,`
` ...is what your face is telling me."`
`"Of course.`
` ......I'm sure you guessed this, ...but it isn't pretty."`
`"Even so......`
` ......Even if it is another world, ......it's still about me."`
`"......You have both the right to know and the right not to know.`
` If you can convince yourself that what you're seeing is a person similar to yet different from you—that it is not you but someone else—then go ahead and touch it."`
`"You want to know, don't you...?`
` About the path that fate could have chosen for you..."`
`"............I ask this as your partner.`
` Would you show that to me?"`
`"As your partner, I'd say "look".`
` ......But as a friend, I'd say "don't"."`
`"Unfortunately,`
` I'm not your friend."`
`"Then, as a partner, I have one last question."`
`"What?"`
`"Are you............`
`.........a man or a woman?"`
`"..................Well, that came out of nowhere."`
`"I could see you as a fairly slender boy.`
` But then again, I could also see you as a no‐nonsense sort of girl.`
` ......Even {f:5:Bernkastel} has been intentionally keeping it a secret.`
` She made Jessica call you "the future heir" all the time, instead of "big brother" or "big sister"."`
`"......*giggle*.`
` You are quick."`
`"People often ask me about my gender.`
` It's become quite frustrating, so I always give the same response.`
` ......‘Which do you think I look like?’"`
`".........In the fifth game, you're treated as a man.`
` But in countless other games, you're thought of as a woman."`
`"......In the sixth game, when Ushiromiya Battler was the Master, two demons of different sexes appeared, but we didn't know which was which, referencing this again.`
` ......In fact, strictly speaking, it started all the way back in the very first game.`
` .........Your gender is one of the hidden mysteries that exists outside the games themselves."`
`"Having to say it straight out frustrates me, so I won't give you an answer.`
` We're partners, right?`
` Does it really matter if I'm not the gender you'd prefer?"`
`"........................`
` ......You're right.`
` If we're working together on this, I don't care what your gender is."`
`"Thank you.`
` ......I've formed a bit of a complex about it, so your words are very gratifying."`
`"I'm all for gender equality.`
` .........If someone's a waste of space, I'll smack 'em no matter who they are."`
`"And of course, I'll pinch rude people no matter which gender they are."`
`Slowly, ......Lion reached out and touched the fragment.`
`A moment later, Lion seemed to undergo a violent bout of dizziness...and silently slumped over like a puppet with its strings cut.`
`It was no surprise.`
` When people who don't understand parallel universes have many different fates jammed into their heads,`
` they tend to feel like their heads are swelling and their sense of self is melting away.`
`......Lion seemed to have lost consciousness.`
`"So, ......Lion had what it took to learn everything."`
`"A perfect piece to be your partner, wouldn't you say?"`
`"I'll continue my reasoning.`
` ......I've talked about the dead cat."`
`"Very true.`
` Next up is the living cat."`
`"The only one who can kill the {f:5:Beatrice} of 1986 is the one who created her."`
`"There were tons of hints.`
` If you think about it, they've been coming since back when {f:5:Beatrice} was running the games."`
`"That's true.`
` ......In the fourth game between {f:5:Beatrice} and Battler, {f:5:Beatrice}'s origin became clear.`
` And, at that point, I learned who {f:5:Beatrice} was, and I understood that person's heart."`
`"What do you mean by heart?"`
`"......The reason for committing the crime.`
` ......The reason that {f:5:Beatrice} had to gamble her own fate in the commission of a game‐like crime on October 5th, 1986—`
`the motive."`
`"Impressive.`
` So, you'd figured out the whodunit and the whydunit by the end of the fourth game.`
` ......Then what about the howdunit?"`
`"Once you know who the culprit is, theorizing about the howdunit isn't impossible.`
` ......Those linked locked rooms in the third game were so skillfully done, I felt like clapping."`
`"And what about the riddle at the end of the fourth game,`
` "who am I"......?"`
`"The "culprit" who can kill you for certain at the stroke of midnight on October 5th no matter where you are.`
` It was possible to form a certain kind of hypothesis at the moment the question was asked.`
` ......You might call that the other treasure of the Golden Land."`
`"......Oh?`
` So, you say that by the fourth game,`
` ......in other words, with just {f:5:Beatrice}'s games, you managed to reach all of the answers?"`
`"It's possible.`
` ......{f:5:Lambdadelta}'s and Battler's games after that were just an extra helping of hints.`
` ......As is this game of yours."`
`"*giggle*giggle*......`
` ......In that case, why don't you stop beating around the bush, and just tell me?`
` .........Who is...`
`the culprit......?"`
`At that moment, .........though there hadn't been anyone but them in the chapel, quiet footsteps rang out.`
`That silhouetted figure slowly walked up to Will and {f:5:Bernkastel}...and gave a small bow.`
`".........So, you've come."`
`"Did you call this person here?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Whodunit.`
` Howdunit.`
` And...whydunit.`
` ......I understand this person's motive."`
`"......And {i:you}, are you going to give up just because he's found out your motive...?`
` There's no concrete evidence, right?`
` You could make a flashy fight of it, with red and blue."`
`"That's not what they want anymore."`
`The person nodded slightly.`
`Their wish......was for someone to realize.`
`Now that this had happened, they had no intention of engaging in trivial excuses or pointless word games...`
`"I believe that I understand your motive,`
` ......your heart.`
` ......I am going to talk about it now.`
` I called you here...`
`to listen...`
`...and correct me if I've gotten anything wrong."`
`"...................................."`
`The two of them nodded to each other once more.`
`"I found the message you put into your four games.`
` ......And through three games with different Masters, I pictured the strange sort of fate that must have toyed with your life.`
` ......I was left speechless.`
` ......In every game, you die without revealing that truth to anyone."`
`Having you confess in this empty chapel might be pointless.`
`However, even so, .........I believe it will bring you some measure of salvation.`
`People are only saved when someone understands them.`
`It's time someone forgave this pitiable witch, who went years after her death without being understood,`
` ............and whose life ended before the one man she wanted to understand her could do so.`
`At the end of the fifth game, Battler finally understood.`
`......However,`
` .........it took him so long...`
`...that he didn't make it in time.`
`So, even though she is alive here and now, Battler cannot save her.`
`That's why he's absent from {f:5:Beatrice}'s funeral. He won't come.`
` ......He won't make it in time.`
`"......This is {f:5:Beatrice}'s funeral.`
` You will confess,`
` ......the divine Master will hear,`
` .........and I will forgive you.`
` .........That's supposed to be Battler's job, but he didn't make it in time.`
` So, you'll have to settle for me."`
`"......Beato gave out so many hints, too.`
` Lambda also gave that bonehead Battler a ton of hints.`
` ......And his response, that game of repentance, that was hilarious as well.`
` ......But I won't be making anyone laugh.`
` I'll just indifferently carry out your funeral."`
`"No more talking from you.`
` That's my job."`
`"............*giggle*."`
`"If you're ready, let's begin.`
` ......No one will rush you.`
` .........{f:5:Bernkastel} has closed off time for eternity until your funeral ends.`
` You have endless time to prepare yourself emotionally..."`
`The shadowy figure slowly shook its head.`
`It had come here because it was already ready.`
`Will nodded to show he understood.`
`......Then, the two of them looked into {f:5:Bernkastel}'s eyes,`
` ......and Will spoke out clearly.`
`{a:c:`
`"Here's the culprit."}`
