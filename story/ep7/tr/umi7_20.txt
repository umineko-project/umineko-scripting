`Two white pieces were set on the chessboard.`
`......The countless black pieces surrounding them were packed tightly together, not even placed on the squares anymore.`
`Then, {f:5:Bernkastel} tipped the two white pieces over...`
`...and took them off the board.`
`"May I end it there?"`
`".........Yes.`
` Your reading truly does fit my ears well, my miko."`
`"As you wished, I've scraped out even the inner parts of the guts.`
` Was this enough to check your answers with?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......I am very satisfied.`
` Using the answer you have revealed as a key, I will go back through all the tales so far,`
` opening the locked rooms like treasure boxes, one by one."`
`".........It's fun finding the key.`
` And it's even more fun to stick it into all the locks.`
` You have done well, my miko.`
` From this point on, I would like to enjoy my thoughts alone.`
` This has been enough......"`
`The Witch of Theatergoing sat back in her rocking chair, a satisfied smile on her face, as though enjoying a pleasant aftertaste.`
`There was no need for a game board anymore.`
`She just had to go back in her mind, through the whole set of tales, to check whether her theory was right or not.`
`It seemed to leave her pleasantly drunk, even better than the most expensive wine......`
`".........Are you done with me now?"`
`"You have done well, my miko.`
` I absolve you of your duty.`
` ......I will return to my slumber.`
` I'd like to enjoy this pleasant dream for a few more centuries."`
`"And when I grow tired of that,`
` ......you will find yet another tale to keep me entertained.`
` ......For those centuries, which will pass in the blink of an eye,`
` I grant you your freedom."`
`"Heheheheheh......`
` Splendidly done, {f:5:Bernkastel}, my darling, darling miko......"`
`".........That's not my concern.`
` Just shrivel up and die, won't you.`
` So long, for the rest of time."`
`"You call a few mere centuries "for the rest of time"?`
` *cackle*cackle*...............`
` ......................................."`
`{f:5:Featherine}'s consciousness slowly faded away.`
`As the owner of the study's slumber grew deeper,`
` ......the lights about the room slowly darkened.`
`"Good night forever, Auaurora.`
` ............You don't need this game board anymore.`
` I'll take it."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} reached out towards Beato's game board, which lay on the table in front of {f:5:Featherine}'s rocking chair, and tapped it twice.`
`The game board and the pieces flew into the air, folded up and put themselves away, then landed on {f:5:Bernkastel}'s outstretched right hand.`
`"......I still haven't had a chance to do any real Game Mastering.`
` ......I just did Beato's funeral.`
` That, and tearing out the guts.`
` ............I still haven't done anything."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel}'s smile twisted evilly.`
`Then, the game board floated up once again, .........and a world unfolded itself above {f:5:Bernkastel}'s palm......`
`"Now, pieces of Beato's game......?`
` I'm going to have you spin a truly brutal tale to truly entertain me.`
` Tremble with fear of the absolute fate you have been promised.`
` ......By the name of {f:5:Bernkastel}, Witch of Miracles,`
` ......and as the final Game Master of Beato's game, I proclaim it."`
`"......Though just saying it would be boring.`
` ......Maybe I should follow Beato's rules and say it in red."`
`"Good idea, I think.`
` It looks like there might still be some witches with naive dreams."`
`"Ah, Lambda. So you're here?`
` Of course you are. You're always wherever I am."`
`"Go on and say it.`
` You tell those naive dreamers."`
`"Yes, I will.`
` ......As the Witch of Miracles, and as the final Game Master, I proclaim the start of the final game.`
` And I make you this promise."`
`{a:c:`
`{p:1:I will not give this game a happy ending.}}`
`*sob*.`
` ......*sob*sob*......`
`A single girl......was crying in a desolate, quiet chapel.`
`She was a small girl.`
` ......Only six years old.`
`The girl who would, for twelve years starting now,`
` lament the fact that she wasn't on the island on October 4th and 5th, 1986......`
`Then,`
` .........a man appeared......`
`The man noticed the girl,`
` ......walked up to her quietly, trying not to scare her,`
` ......and put an arm gently around her shoulder......`
`".........Onii‐chan..............."`
`"I've been looking for you, Ange......"`
`The girl jumped into her big brother's chest and started crying again...`
`"What's wrong?`
` ......Why are you so sad?"`
`"Today, a kid in class bullied me......`
` He said the people on TV were saying Mom had ties to bad people.`
` .........So, he said that Mom and Dad were the culprits, and that they probably killed everyone......`
` ......I asked Auntie Eva, hoping she'd say it wasn't true, but she didn't say anything......`
` ......Mom and Dad aren't bad people, are they?`
` Are they...?"`
`"Poor thing......`
` ......Everyone says whatever they please about what might have happened on that island on that day...`
` ......Sit over here."`
`"...............Okay..."`
`When the man pointed to the floor, a group of gold butterflies gathered there and created a chair.`
`The girl obediently sat down on it......`
`"......You know, don't you, Onii‐chan?`
` You know that Mom and Dad aren't bad people, right?"`
`"Yeah. Of course I know that.`
` ......I know that none of them were bad people."`
`"Then tell me.`
` What happened that day?`
` What happened on Rokkenjima?"`
`"Okay.`
` .........I'll tell you.`
` This is what happened on that day."`
`"Is it......a scary story...?"`
`"Come now."`
`"Is it a sad story......?"`
`"Of course not."`
`"Then, ......what kind of story is it......?"`
`"You can decide that for yourself when you hear it.`
` It isn't a painful story at all.`
` So listen up."`
`"Okay,`
` Battler onii‐chan......"`
`"On that day, we all went to Rokkenjima.`
` There were a lot of us.`
` It was an important day, the day of the family conference."`
`".........Hmm, where should I start?"`
`{a:c:`
`This is...`
`the final game, made just for Ange.`
`}`
`{a:c:`
`Listen, Ange.`
`This is what happened on Rokkenjima on that day.`
`It isn't sad or painful at all.........`
