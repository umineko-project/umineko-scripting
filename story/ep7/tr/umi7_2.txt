`The Ushiromiya family members were relaxing here and there around the waiting room.`
`A light buffet‐style meal had been set up, but it looked a bit stale and not particularly appetizing.`
`Even so, those voracious kids seemed to find it intensely appealing.`
`The cousins had set up camp around it, with Maria at the center.`
`{n}The adult siblings had also formed a group in a different corner.`
`Perhaps because of Kinzo's absence, everyone seemed to be a little more relaxed.`
`"......Lion.`
` Where did you go?`
` ......And who is that?"`
`"Mother,`
` I was entertaining this guest of ours.`
` Will, this is my mother, Natsuhi."`
`"No introductions needed.`
` I just need to hear what she has to say."`
`"Huh? Did you say something?"`
`"No, he said nothing.`
` This is Will‐san.`
` It seems he knew the deceased."`
`With a smile, Lion casually smoothed over Will's words.`
`"He wants to know more about Beatrice.`
` ......Do you know anything about her, Mother?"`
`"........................`
` ......Lion. The deceased is a woman to whom the head once owed a great debt.`
` Nothing more, nothing less.`
` This funeral is a ceremony for the head to repay the debts he made to her while she was alive.`
` That is what I have heard, and there is nothing more to it than that."`
`"......Thanks, Mother.`
` Will, that's all my mother knows."`
`Natsuhi was very resistant to the scandalous rumors that Kinzo, a man she greatly respected, had once had a concubine called Beatrice.`
`However, she also understood that the scandal was probably the truth.`
`Picking up that Natsuhi was in a bad mood and didn't want to talk about this anymore,`
` Lion brought an end to that conversation before Will could say something rude again.`
`"Will.`
` This chapel is the property of our family."`
`"So you're telling me to follow the family's rules?"`
`"You'll speak in a manner appropriate for a guest of the family.`
` And you'll conduct all of your conversations through me.`
` I must ask that you follow those two rules."`
`"I'll work on that."`
`"......The actions of this "{f:5:Bernkastel}" witch have caused us all a great deal of inconvenience.`
` Because of that, I am willing to help you.`
` However, both of us stand on an even footing, so make sure you don't forget it."`
`"And I thought you were just some pampered rich kid.`
` You've got guts."`
`"I must be prepared to shoulder the Ushiromiya family's future, after all."`
`".........Got it.`
` Let's solve this crime together, Watson."`
`"I'm glad to have your cooperation.`
` I wouldn't want to keep your dear cat Diana waiting.`
` Don't you need to feed her soon?"`
`"I gave her extra food today,`
` so she should be good for a while.`
` .........I'm surprised you realized Diana was a cat."`
`"I figured a woman who scratches the sofas when you keep her waiting would be a bit too eccentric."`
`"......Hm."`
`"So?`
` Who will you talk to first?"`
`"Anyone.`
` Everyone.`
` ......Those ones over there are Krauss's siblings, right?"`
`"From right to left, there's Aunt Eva,`
` Uncle Hideyoshi."`
`"Over there is Uncle Rudolf,`
` Aunt Kyrie."`
`"And over there is—"`
`"Ushiromiya Rosa.`
` ......When she was a girl, she once got lost in the forest and bumped into a woman calling herself Beatrice in a hidden mansion."`
`"......I know I shouldn't be surprised anymore,`
` but you really do know everything, don't you?"`
`"So, you know about that story too?"`
`"I managed to overhear her saying that today.`
` ......It looked as though it was bothering her, so I pretended not to hear."`
`"Real model student, you are.`
` ......Introduce me.`
` I want to ask about it."`
`"You're asking this of the model student who pretended not to hear because it just might be a painful topic?"`
`Even this outrageous arrogance is nothing compared to Kinzo.`
`After muttering this several times mentally, Lion shrugged and nodded at Will.`
`"Oh, it's our great successor.`
` And who is this......?"`
`"Oh, Aunt Eva.`
` This is Will‐san.`
` He came to offer flowers for the departed."`
`"But who cares about that.`
` Tell me everything you know about—`
`......nng—"`
`"He says he wants to know about the deceased's connection to the Ushiromiya family."`
`Lion spoke with a bright smile while pinching Will's butt.`
`Will silently protested, as though saying "even for a gag, that hurts",`
` but Lion just played dumb and smiled at Eva like a model student.`
`"Her connection to the Ushiromiya family?`
` ......Well, what is there to say...?"`
`"It's probably more accurate to say "her connection to Father"."`
`"We can be honest here.`
` She was Dad's mistress."`
`"If you call her that, Natsuhi nee‐san will yell at you again.`
` He's "indebted" to her, right?`
` *giggle*."`
`"Yes, of course.`
` Wahahahaha."`
`"......Well, there you have it."`
`"I have no interest in anyone but Rosa—`
`gghh—"`
`"I do believe......that you said you met with Beatrice, Aunt Rosa."`
`"........................"`
`This whole time, Rosa had been hanging her head.`
`{n}Lion's words made her shoulders quiver.`
`"She just suddenly came out with it today.`
` It's a bit hard to believe."`
`"It's the truth...!`
` I killed Beatrice!"`
`"Great, our work here is finished."`
`"Don't get ahead of yourself."`
`Rosa broke down crying and laid her head on the table.`
` Kyrie and Hideyoshi tried to console her......`
`"Rokkenjima is covered by a dense forest.`
` We only know about one tiny portion of it.`
` Just the mansion, the rose garden,`
` and the little path that leads to the harbor."`
`"Since ages ago, there've been stories about how Dad built a hidden mansion somewhere in the vast forest that no one knew about,`
` and that he had his mistress living there."`
`"Rosa‐san probably came upon that hidden mansion by chance......"`
`"But Aunt Rosa, why would you say you killed Beatrice...?"`
`"If I hadn't taken her out, she never would have died...!`
` She was so innocent, like a chick.`
` I took her out, so she just followed along obediently!`
` She stayed right behind me, trusting me completely...!`
` And because I made her take such a dangerous path...!!"`
`"Did you make her walk that way because you were hoping she'd slip and fall from the cliff?"`
`"I never meant to do that!`
` I just thought she'd like to see the ocean...!`
` No,`
` it just looked like the path would be hard to walk,`
` and I thought it would be easier going if we went down the cliff first...!!"`
`"That's not what killing someone means.`
` It was an accident."`
`"It's an accident she never would have had if I hadn't brought her with me, right?!`
` It's my fault!!`
` And then, I abandoned her when she was covered in blood and ran home!!"`
`"It isn't your fault.`
` Beatrice had never seen the ocean before.`
` ......You showed it to her for the first time ever.`
` She was probably so excited that she just happened to take a bad step."`
`"......H‐how can you...?"`
`"Beatrice is grateful to you for what you did. Of course she doesn't hate you for it."`
`"........................`
` Really?`
` ......Is that...`
`really true...?"`
`"She was the one who begged to see the world outside the fence, right?`
` Though it was only for a short while, you made that dream of hers come true.`
` If I were Beatrice, I would thank you for that short bit of time.`
` If she knew that you've been suffering all this time for it, she'd probably feel bad herself."`
`"......Beatrice is grateful for what you did.`
` You're the one who taught her that the sea is blue."`
`".........Is that...`
`...true.........?"`
`"I guarantee it."`
`Will made that statement openly and boldly.`
`No one could tell how Rosa took those words.`
`However, ......they had apparently been enough to remind her to take a handkerchief out of her pocket and wipe her eyes.`
`"......Thank you."`
`"Even now, Beatrice is whispering those words to you."`
`"...............Thank you......"`
`Rosa wiped her eyes with the handkerchief one more time and hung her head.`
`It no longer looked like a fit of sobbing, but more as though she was speaking with the Beatrice of that day within her heart...`
`one last time.`
`"......That was a lot of confidence you put behind a claim you can't back up."`
`"Back up?`
` Is that really necessary to comfort a woman?"`
`"........................`
` I misjudged you a little."`
`For how many years had this tormented Rosa?`
`Now, for the first time,`
` ......Rosa would probably be able to face that innocently smiling Beatrice, who had seen the ocean for the first time in her life.`
`She was the only one who could forgive Rosa.`
`Now, the two of them could finally speak together......`
`"......I don't know who you are, but thank you.`
` ......I wonder if she forgives me."`
`"You've beat yourself up about it for nearly twenty years.`
` That's far too long.`
` She's telling you to knock it off."`
`"......That's right, Aunt Rosa.`
` The more you grieve, the sadder Beatrice would be."`
`"............You too...`
` Thank you.`
` ......I don't know if I will be forgiven,`
` ......but I'll keep on speaking to my heart to see whether she'll forgive me or not.`
` ......Thanks, you two.`
` Sorry for showing you such an embarrassing side of me."`
`"And I'm sorry to say this right after saying something so pretty,`
` ......but I want you to talk to me.`
` Tell me what happened back then."`
`".........Will‐san!"`
`"Thanks, but it's alright.`
` ......I'll talk.`
` Hiding this and keeping quiet about it for so long might have been my greatest sin."`
`"Exactly when was it that you met Beatrice?"`
`Upon hearing this question, ......Rosa closed her eyes lightly, reaching back to a past she didn't want to remember...`
`"......It was about twenty years ago.`
` .........Twenty.........or, wait, it might have been nineteen or eighteen years ago.`
` .........I'm sorry.`
` I've tried to force myself to forget it for so long that I've nearly forgotten that part completely."`
`"It should have been 1967."`
`Ronove had guaranteed that with the red truth in the third game.`
`"Th‐that's right......`
` It was probably about 1967.`
` I can remember what happened as clearly as a picture......`
` I'll never forget......"`
`"If it's tough for you, don't feel like you have to tell us."`
`"Yes, clear as a picture, if you don't mind.`
` ............Ngah!`
` ......Dammit, that hurts, Lion."`
`"What does?"`
`"I took it very hard when I found out that my tutor had told Mother about something I'd shared in confidence.`
` I lost control of myself and ran deep into the forest."`
`This tale had also been told in a previous fragment.`
`Back when Rosa was just a kid, she had gone deep into the forest,`
` ......found a hidden mansion, and met with a mysterious woman who called herself Beatrice......`
`"......But that forest is so thick it's hard just to move around in it."`
`"I even surprised myself......`
` To think that I made it so far into such a dense forest.`
` ......I was tormented by twigs and sharp leaves over and over again."`
`"However, that wasn't enough to bother me on that day.`
` ......After all, I wanted to disappear into the forest and vanish forever.`
` ......If, by some chance, there really was a witch's mansion in the depths of the forest,`
` ......I hoped that she might take me to the land of happiness, or else turn me into a frog and make me a resident of the forest."`
`"So, you then reached the hidden mansion, Kuwadorian,`
` and met a woman who called herself Beatrice."`
`".........Yes.`
` I did."`
`"Was that Beatrice the same as the one in the portrait?"`
`"........................`
` ......Yes.`
` They were the same person."`
`"Beautiful blue eyes.`
` Golden hair.`
` A black dress.`
` It truly was the subject of that portrait.`
` ......When Father first had it hung,`
` ......I realized that the twenty years I had spent trying to forget must have seemed just as long for Father,`
` if not even longer, and I was wracked by even greater guilt..."`
`"Stop there.`
` ......Are we sure that this is the same Beatrice that Rosa‐san met?"`
`Immediately, Kyrie spoke the question that Will had been thinking of.`
`It would be too rash to assume that the Beatrice Kinzo met...`
`was the same person as the one Rosa met.`
`The time and generation were different for each.`
`"Beatrice is supposed to be that lady of leisure who lent Dad all that gold shortly after the war, right?"`
`"Usin' Beatrice's gold as a foundation, Father revived the Ushiromiya family and got super rich.`
` Then he bought Rokkenjima and moved over.`
` Rosa‐san's meetin' must have been at least ten years after that."`
`"A woman with free control over ten tons of gold could hardly be some little girl.`
` And ten more years passed after that before she met Rosa.`
` ...Rosa,`
` about how old did the Beatrice you met look?"`
`"......She looked older than I was at the time,`
` ......but even so, it looked as though she might just be on the cusp of adulthood.`
` Yes, exactly the sort of age of the Beatrice in the portrait."`
`"Did she look middle‐aged or past her prime?"`
`"If I had to call her an adult or a child, she was clearly closer to being a child.`
` There's no way she was middle‐aged."`
`"And isn't that strange?`
` We have the Beatrice you met, and the Beatrice who gave Father the gold,`
` but their ages don't match."`
`"In other words, they're different people."`
`"Different people...who look very similar and have the same name......"`
`"It might have been her daughter.`
` It makes sense for them to look alike if they were mother and child."`
`"His mistress's daughter......`
` It is possible.`
` Perhaps Father had an illegitimate child with the Beatrice who gave him the gold."`
`"So, the one Rosa bumped into was Beatrice II.`
` ......Makes those ages work out nicely."`
`"................................."`
`"I see......`
` In other words, there are two people called Beatrice."`
`Kinzo secretly raised his mistress's child in a hidden mansion.`
`That would make logical sense.`
` Everyone nodded, agreeing.`
`......However, Will's expression was slightly unsatisfied, and he scratched at his head...`
`"So, it would seem that this funeral...`
`exists for the two Beatrices he couldn't hold a ceremony for because he'd kept them secret......"`
`"Rosa.`
` I know you probably don't want to remember, but tell me about that accident.`
` After Beatrice fell, was she still breathing?"`
`"No.`
` ......Her eyes were open wide.`
` She fell upside down, head first, and knocked her head against a sharp crag on the rocky beach.`
` And she fell from such a height......`
` ............Her skull had split and caved inwards.`
` ......That beautiful golden hair was stained red with blood almost instantly......"`
`"Was it the sort of wound that showed at a glance that she was undoubtedly dead?"`
`"Yes.`
` I saw the insides of her cracked head!`
` It had caved in deep enough to fit your fist inside it...!`
` No one could be naive enough to see that and still hope she was alive!"`
`"......Will.`
` Do you really need to ask anything more?"`
`"That's enough for the time of the accident.`
` What did you do afterwards?"`
`"I dashed away at full speed.`
` ......I wasn't even thinking about calling for help."`
`".........I wanted to escape from that place as fast as I could.`
` Half‐crazed, sobbing, and out of breath, I kept on running about at random.`
` ......Eventually, I came across a familiar lion statue."`
`"Oh, the one in front of the chapel?"`
`"No, the one behind it.`
` ......Anyway, I made it back to the mansion.`
` I couldn't tell anyone, and I didn't want to.`
` I stayed quiet until nightfall.`
` It was so horrible of me.`
` If I had hurried and told someone, they might have brought her a first aid kit, and she might have been saved......"`
`"How is a first aid kit going to help with a crushed cranium?`
` ......You didn't kill her.`
` Don't worry about that anymore."`
`"..........................."`
`"Then, ......what did you do next?"`
`"......That night, I turned over in my bed so many times.`
` I couldn't sleep.`
` ......Late that night, I quietly...`
`......called Genji‐san on the phone and told him..."`
`"......What did he say?"`
`"He told me to let him handle everything, and to speak of this to no one.`
` ......I spent the next several days terrified that Father would call for me and scold me brutally."`
`"But......he didn't.`
` Genji‐san kept on doing his job quietly, just like normal.`
` ......Father stayed locked up in his study, not knowing any of it......"`
`"At the very least, none of us ever heard about it."`
`"......Genji‐san probably managed to clean everything up nicely."`
`"After all, I expect they couldn't let knowledge of that child go public......"`
`"Hmmmmm......`
` Even if she was an illegitimate child, she was his own flesh and blood.`
` It must have been tough for Father, not bein' able to hold a real funeral for her......"`
`".........I guess that's why we're having this funeral."`
`"And then?"`
`"That's all I know."`
`".....................`
` And that's all I know too."`
`"I'm not hiding anything else.`
` I've told you everything.`
` ......I swear it."`
`".............................."`
`Will scratched at his head, letting his gaze wander.`
`It had taken Rosa a lot of determination to make this confession, but it was nothing particularly special for Will.`
`It had been little more than a review of information he already knew......`
`"Thanks, Aunt Rosa.`
` .........Is that enough for you, Will?`
` Are you satisfied?"`
`"That's enough.`
` It was a nice review."`
`To Will, Rosa's memories gave only information that was already known.`
`This was the first time he'd heard all that about her running back to the mansion after Beatrice fell to her death,`
` but none of it was particularly surprising.`
`Apparently, Rosa really didn't know any more than this......`
`If he wanted to learn something beyond the fragments given to him by {f:5:Bernkastel}, he would need to find new testimony.`
`"Lion.`
` Tell Kinzo that I want to talk to him.`
` It looks like we won't get anywhere without asking the man himself."`
`"Where are you going?"`
`"......Off to cool my head and organize my thoughts.`
` Don't follow me."`
`"Well, pardon me for asking.`
` Please take your time."`
`After giving an elegant bow, Lion made a face, tongue sticking out.`
`Unless Will had eyes on the back of his head, he couldn't have seen this last bit......`
`Will returned to the chapel by himself.`
`{n}The cold air and the monotonous sound of the rain were comforting.`
`{a:c:`
`"......So, how's the game?"}`
`And he had come here for a little peace and quiet...`
`No sooner had he let out a sigh of relief than that voice rang out.`
`"That's one for you to answer."`
`It was as though she had been sitting there all along.`
` ......{f:5:Bernkastel} appeared on top of the altar once more.`
`Apparently, she found this particular altar extremely comfortable.`
`"......Battler annoyed me over and over with his incompetence.`
` You're very competent compared to him, so it's a lot easier to relax."`
`"Unlike Ushiromiya Battler's games, I have nothing standing in my way.`
` It's easy."`
`"That sort of game has already ended.`
` Tales can be enjoyed twice.`
` First you love them.`
` Then you tear out their guts.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*."`
`"Tch. You think I'm a butcher?"`
`"Well?`
` Do you think you know who killed {f:5:Beatrice}...?"`
`"Rosa's confession is something I already know from a previous fragment.`
` There was no brand new information.`
` ......We're still at square one."`
`"*giggle*giggle*......"`
`"Unless Ushiromiya Kinzo tells us what really happened, we won't get any further than this.`
` Don't tell me that sweet‐talking Kinzo into spilling the beans...`
`is all part and parcel of this game."`
`"If it were, I'd die of boredom.`
` ......Kinzo refuses to speak of the truth and is himself the king protected by his castle,`
` but it wouldn't be any fun to have that stand in the way of your game..."`
`"......I won't torture.`
` It's not my style."`
`"I know that.`
` As the Game Master, I will grant you power.`
` So that you can get the truth from Kinzo, of course."`
`Still wearing shoes, {f:5:Bernkastel} stepped into the casket, picked up one of the flowers that had been set as offerings,`
` ......and blew hard, as though scattering fluff from a dandelion.`
`When she did, a single petal broke off and drifted down towards Will,`
` no longer gold, but with the shine of a transparent crystal......`
`"The "detective's authority"?"`
`"Heh, what's {i:that} pathetic ability?`
` ......No.`
` This is your invitation to the auditorium."`
`"......The "theatergoing authority"?`
` .........Granting that is supposed to be forbidden without authorization from the Senate."`
`"I'm granting it. On my game board.`
` Who's going to stop me......?"`
`"............Hmph."`
`Though the crystal flower petal danced in the wind, it wouldn't fly away anywhere until Will accepted it.`
`Will remembered how useless it was to argue with witches, and he snatched it up.`
`When he did, the petal flashed brightly for an instant, melted into Will's palm, and disappeared...`
`"Entertain me if you can.`
` And try and enjoy yourself.`
` ......You must also be interested in seeing what the guts of {f:5:Beatrice}'s game board look like, right?"`
`"Not really."`
`After Will's rude answer,`
` {f:5:Bernkastel} vanished into thin air, leaving behind an obnoxious laugh......`
`".........Tch."`
`After clicking his tongue, Will turned around, visibly annoyed.`
`......When he did, it felt as though his gaze crossed that of a shadowy figure standing by the door in front of him that led outside.`
`"Who's there?"`
`"Ah, ......p‐pardon me...`
` I heard a voice, s‐...so I wondered who it was......"`
`"Ah, Shannon.`
` So you're running the reception desk this time...?"`
`"Yes.`
` I've been taking it in turns with Kanon‐kun to run the reception desk..."`
`"And where is Kanon?"`
`"A short while ago, he was ordered by......umm,`
` ......L‐Lion‐sama to take a break, so he's resting now."`
`".........So, you don't know Lion either?"`
`"Huh?`
` ......Of...course I..............."`
`"Ushiromiya Lion is the successor to the head and the only one permitted the silver ring.`
` ......Why are you stumbling over that name when you've worked here for ten years?"`
`"Th‐...that's............"`
`"Don't worry.`
` I don't recognize Lion either.`
` ......Krauss is supposed to be the successor to the head.`
` Jessica is supposed to be his only child.`
` There hasn't been a single fragment with anyone named Lion in the Ushiromiya family."`
`Upon hearing that Will didn't recognize Lion either, Shannon looked back up at him in surprise.`
`Apparently, she was a bit relieved to find that she wasn't going crazy by herself.`
`......However, her expression quickly grew uncertain once more.`
`"Wh‐where......is this place...?`
` I think it's the Ushiromiya family chapel.`
` ......However, something feels different about it."`
`"Also, I never knew that someone named L‐......Lion‐sama existed.`
` ......And yet, Madam, Krauss‐sama, ......the Master, Milady, and all the relatives all talk as though it's perfectly natural......`
` I just......don't understand what's happening......"`
`"......Lion is a piece placed by {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` She also said that she'd switched to a larger cat box to place that piece.`
` ......On top of that, it seems this world isn't a proper world, but one made out of several different fragments sewn together."`
`It's as though......this is a special stage set up specifically for this game.`
`......I'm sure she's nodding at my thoughts right now, laughing and chomping down popcorn.`
`"How long have you worked here in this world?"`
`"T‐......ten years."`
`I see.`
` So it really is a special stage.`
`After all, right when I entered the chapel, I spotted Kinzo.`
`If Shannon has worked here for ten years, then this is 1986, the stage of Beato's game.`
`In that case, Kinzo shouldn't exist.`
`{n}However, he definitely was here a few minutes ago.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} promised that all of the information needed for reasoning was gathered here.`
`She must have crammed all manner of stuff in here to make that true...`
`I see, so it really is a special stage.`
`"You have served the Ushiromiya family for many years.`
` So, just how much do you know about Beatrice?"`
`"......I know the Master loved her deeply, but other than that..."`
`"Is that all?"`
`"A‐and, umm,`
` .........they say that she's the master of Rokkenjima's night...`
`...umm..."`
`"That's right.`
` The name of the ghost rumored to wander the mansion night after night is also {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`That brings the number of Beatrices to three.`
`The first is the "Beatrice" from more than thirty years ago, who is said to have given Kinzo the gold.`
`The second is the "Beatrice" from twenty years ago, who met Rosa.`
`The third is the "{f:5:Beatrice}" of the ghost stories, who is rumored to be the master of the night on Rokkenjima.`
`"......Furudo Erika's reasoning was probably correct.`
` It started out as the legend of the evil spirits on Rokkenjima.`
` Later on, elements such as Kinzo's occult hobbies, the name and portrait of the mysterious woman "Beatrice",`
` and the epitaph got mixed in, and it all fused into the legend of the Golden Witch."`
`"......And so the darkness of the night gained the personality of a witch.`
` That's the third {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` This is the veil the serial killer hides behind."`
`"......Uh, umm..............."`
`Apparently, she didn't understand a word of Will's sudden monologue.`
`Shannon tried to follow along, but she seemed to be having difficulty.`
`"Don't waste your time trying to understand.`
` You'll just get a headache."`
`"M‐my apologies......"`
`"Kanon doesn't know Lion either, right?"`
`"............Yes.`
` Kanon‐kun was the same as me."`
`Shannon...and Kanon, huh.........`
`".....................`
` ......Call Kanon over here. I want to talk to the pair of you about something."`
`When Will said these words, Shannon's face went blank and her eyes went wide.`
`"My apologies.`
` We aren't allowed to leave the reception desk unmanned, so I can't leave to go get him."`
`"Then find a replacement and have them take over the reception desk until you get back.`
` You, me, and Kanon.`
` ......We, the three people who don't know Lion, need to talk."`
`"......................................."`
`"................................."`
`"......We've been told that one person is enough to run the reception desk."`
`"But no one told you there was anything wrong with two people manning it, right?"`
`"We are low on helpers today, so we were told that the reception desk does not require two people manning it."`
`"Who gave you that order?`
` Kinzo? Krauss?`
` Or was it Lion?`
` I will ask about it."`
`"It was...the one who orders me.`
` I cannot disobey or{f:5:ders}."`
`"Who is this person?`
` I'll negotiate with them."`
`"You cannot {f:5:negotiate}.`
` It i{f:5:s} the o{f:5:ne} who or{f:5:ders us}."`
`"Call Kanon over here.`
` ......I hate theatergoing just as much as I hate torture."`
`Slowly, ......Will pulled his right hand out of his pocket.`
`When he slowly opened his fist,`
` .........a small, bright glow emanated from it.`
`The flower petal {f:5:Bernkastel} had given him had become a glowing birthmark, which sparkled......`
`He held that hand out towards Shannon......and slowly approached her.`
`"Call Kanon.`
` I want to check something with you two."`
`"{f:5:I ca  nnot call him. Do you sti  ll wish for me to do so}......?"`
`"If you don't call him, I'm going to "watch your play"."`
`"{f:5:If you insi  st, ......I can c al   l him especi ally}..."`
`".............................."`
`"                                                            ."`
`There was some kind of incomprehensible tension between the two.`
`Will stood there, his left hand still in his pocket and his right palm glowing and stretched out towards her.`
`Shannon just stood there, her hands still folded politely in front of her,`
` ......her posture beautiful.`
`And yet, ......it felt oddly as though raindrops were sparking and crackling in midair......`

`"................................."`
`Will's expression had remained unchanged the whole time.`
`{n}Shannon's face was still kind and gentle.`
`And yet, the tension was as icy as a frozen lake...`
`......Beginners in chess will sometimes move their king into check without noticing.`
`One might mercilessly capture the king in such a situation, ......but high‐level players are supposed to calmly warn beginners about their mistake.`
`"If you take one more step,`
` ......you'll get captured."`
`This was......similar to that.........`
`"................................."`
` ......I see.`
` So, after all......`
`"I get it.`
` That's enough.`
` .........You guys can take it in turns to run the reception desk."`
`Slowly, ......Will lowered his hand.`
`"Thank you for understanding."`
`The glow slowly vanished from Will's palm.`
`That completely incomprehensible tension melted away...`
`...like a sugar cube in water.`
`However, nothing had changed since the beginning.`
`Will's expression and Shannon's expression......were the same as they always had been.`
`"Oh, are you leaving?"`
`Footsteps approached them.`
` It was Lion.`
`"I'm just standing here, talking.`
` I wanted to ask her something."`
`"......What could that be?`
` Did you find what you were looking for?"`
`".....................`
` Yeah."`
`"I'm honored to have been of service."`
`"........................"`
`"That's a shame.`
` If you were looking for an umbrella, I could have gotten you one right away."`
`"Did you convince Kinzo?"`
`"......I told him that a rare guest wanted to greet him.`
` He says he'll meet with you."`
`"Did you tell him that I wanted to ask about Beatrice?"`
`"Isn't that your job?"`
`With a slightly mischievous look, Lion turned away.`
`Will scratched his head and shrugged, looking annoyed.`
`".........Ah, well.`
` Guess I'll get a chance to try this out."`
`Will opened his right hand and showed it to Lion.`
`It was just a hand, without anything remotely remarkable about it.`
`Lion's head tilted to the side in bafflement at this strange gesture.`
`"Good work.`
` ......Umm,`
` ......your name was......"`
`"It's Shannon."`
`"That's right, Shannon.`
` Please continue manning the reception desk.`
` Make sure you keep warm."`
`"Thank you very much, Lion‐sama."`
`Shannon bowed deeply in response to Lion's kind words.`
`There was not even a trace of tension in her manner...`
`"Let's go, Will.`
` You won't want to miss your chance.`
` ......The head's mood changes quicker than the autumn sky."`
`"Good luck."`
`".........Let's go."`
