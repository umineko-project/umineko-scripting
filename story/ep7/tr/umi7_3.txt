`"I've brought Willard‐san."`
`"........................"`
`Kinzo and Genji could be seen in the VIP room.`
`Kinzo was sitting back in a chair, his eyes closed as though in a troubled sleep.`
`"......My lord.`
` The guest has come to see you."`
`"..............................nn."`
`Kinzo slowly opened his eyes.`
`{n}......Those eyes were red from crying.`
`They regained their focus and slowly fell on Will.`
`"......I am...Ushiromiya Kinzo."`
`"......Will."`
`"I'm Willard.`
` Allow me to express my condolences."`
`"......So, you've come to visit Beatrice's funeral.`
` ......Just who are you?"`
`"I'm no one. I have no connections with anyone.`
` Don't think too deeply about it.`
` You'll just get a headache.`
` .........Ow."`
`"I ask that you choose your words a little more carefully."`
`"......Hmph, what a strange guest.`
` So?`
` What business do you have with me?"`
`"I want to ask about Beatrice."`
`"What..................?"`
`Kinzo's gaze grew sharp.`
`Lion felt a bit lightheaded and wondered why this guy had to be so direct.`
`"Why do you ask?`
` I thought you were no one.`
` Why do you want to know about Beatrice?`
` What purpose could it serve?"`
`"Because I am no one,`
` I can listen to your tale without bias and record it.`
` You will probably leave this world before too long.`
` If you die without telling anything about Beatrice,`
` your children will adorn her with their own fanciful tales and write them into history."`
`"Pft, hahahahahahahahahaha!`
` You entertain me, boy.`
` You think yourself a testament taker?!"`
`"But that is wholly unnecessary.`
` Beatrice is mine alone.`
` No matter what anyone says,`
` no one can defile our story. What they say is of no consequence!`
` No matter how Krauss and the others misconstrue it, it matters nothing to me!"`
`"......Willard‐sama.`
` The Master does not like wills.`
` He is not one to abandon anything while he still lives."`
`"......Probably true.`
` I thought it sounded a bit unlike him."`
`"The spirit to struggle onward to our dying breaths is what makes us human!`
` The idea that I would give up before my time and leave behind a will is laughably absurd!"`
`"Yes, that does sound a bit more like you.`
` ......It's not your style to ask someone to write about the past just because you feel you might die soon."`
`"......We know how deeply you loved Beatrice‐sama.`
` You are the model most worthy of respect that any of us know, and an example for us to follow in every aspect of our lives."`
`"Please, for the sake of us wandering souls,`
` may we learn of how you loved her to the last, how your love for her guided you through life,`
` ......and the strength of your love for her, so that your story might guide us through our own lives...?"`
`"You're pretty good at this."`
`"It's your fault for being so tactless."`
`"Boy.`
` What do you know of Beatrice?`
` A truly ignorant person would not hold any interest at all.`
` The mere fact that you know her name shows that you are neither ignorant nor unconnected."`
`"Good point.`
` ......The Beatrice I know of...`
`is the woman you loved, the one you met before the mansion on Rokkenjima was even built.`
` However, she probably departed from this world, leaving behind a daughter.`
` That is the girl who was raised in Kuwadorian."`
`".........Oho."`
`"Willard‐sama.`
` There is no building known as Kuwadorian on Rokkenjima."`
`"......That name, Kuwadorian...`
` ...You mentioned it when we were talking with Aunt Rosa too.`
` ......What in the world does it mean?"`
`"You should have an idea by now.`
` It's the name of the hidden mansion deep in the forest where his mistress's daughter lived."`
`"Interesting.`
` ......So, you actually know the name of Kuwadorian.`
` ......Continue. You have sparked my interest."`
`Kinzo shrugged and grinned......`
`"The one living in Kuwadorian was probably Beatrice's daughter.`
` However, it seems that you didn't think of her that way."`
`"Oho.`
` ......Then how did I think of her?"`
`"When Ushiromiya Rosa went to Kuwadorian, Beatrice told her a little about herself.`
` ......In that conversation, she referred to you as Kinzo.`
` It was the same when she spoke to you directly."`
`"Though she said that she thought of you as a father, she didn't call you Father.`
` ......She either didn't call you that, or she wasn't allowed to call you that.`
` That can only mean one thing."`
`"And what might that be......?"`
`"Reincarnation.`
` You didn't think of your daughter as a child Beatrice left behind.`
` You believed that the dead Beatrice had revived into a new body.`
` ......Genji.`
` Once in the past, you spoke in front of Natsuhi and several other family members,`
` stating that there had never been a child between Kinzo and Beatrice."`
`".........I have no memory of saying this."`
`Of course, "this game's" Genji probably wouldn't remember that.`
`However, near the end of the first game, when the survivors all gathered in Kinzo's study...`
`...Genji was asked whether Kinzo and Beatrice ever had a child together,`
` and he denied it, saying "I have not heard of anything like that".`
`"‘I have not heard that’... In a way, it was a perfect sort of answer for one of Kinzo's confidants.`
` ......After all, in Kinzo's eyes, she wasn't a daughter,`
` but {i:Beatrice} reborn."`
`"Will...!`
` I don't know what you're talking about, but I will not let you slander the family head!"`
`"This isn't slander.`
` It's reasoning.`
` ......However, I understand the heart.`
` Beatrice was the woman you loved most.`
` She remained that way even after death, for all eternity, and without fading in the slightest."`
`"However, given the child's blue eyes, beautiful blonde hair, and facial features which resembled Beatrice from a young age,`
` if you had gradually begun to think that she might actually be Beatrice reborn,`
` that wouldn't be surprising."`
`"...............My lord.`
` Shall I...?"`
`Shall I throw this insolent man out?`
` Genji asked Kinzo.`
`For a while, Kinzo hung his head in silence, as though remembering something from his own past.`
`"Your daughter grew to be beautiful and nearly identical to her mother.`
` You must have been ecstatic.`
` However, it's doubtful that you were fully satisfied by this.`
` ......After all, though she was Beatrice reborn to you,`
` she didn't feel that way herself."`
`"......How can you know that?"`
`"She couldn't shake the feeling that there was something out of place about her being called Beatrice.`
` ......People never feel anything out of place about the name they were given at the time of their birth.`
` However, she did have that feeling.`
` That must mean that she was aware that the name "Beatrice" was not hers."`
`In Kuwadorian, she asked both Kinzo and Rosa about who she was.`
`— Who am I?`
` ......Everyone calls me {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...And that does certainly seem to be the name of a great witch, as you say.`
`— ......But that is not me.`
` I cannot use any magic.`
` ......I simply have the soul of that witch sealed inside my body.`
`"........................Her memory...`
`would have returned.`
` ......She was without a doubt Beatrice reborn.`
` ......Her memory was coming back bit by bit.`
` My magical rituals were helping her regain her memories one little bit at a time......"`
`"G‐......Grandfather......"`
`"There's no need to be surprised.`
` If you line up the information in all the games so far, this is the answer it leads you to.`
` ......The {f:5:Beatrice} on the higher plane talked about this in metaphor, saying that Kinzo refused to let the witch's soul escape even after death, and instead caught it and locked it up in a body of flesh.`
` She also said that her power and memory had been sealed.`
` If you match that interpretation of hers to this theory, it all makes sense."`
`"............Willard‐sama.`
` Thanks to a powerful magical ritual, the Master gained a reborn child of the late Beatrice‐sama.`
` That cannot be denied."`
`"I won't contradict the stork.`
` And I don't intend to doubt the depths of Kinzo's love for this woman called Beatrice.`
` .........It's no one's business how a person chooses to show their affection towards their only living reminder of the departed.`
` If she grew to look more and more like Beatrice, and Kinzo's love gave rise to a new, special emotion,`
` I find that a very human reaction."`
`".........You think...`
`...you can understand my love.........?"`
`"I'm not qualified to understand it.`
` However, I'm also not qualified to deny it."`
`"..................Oooh,`
` ......Beatrice......`
` ......Please,`
` .........forgive me........."`
`Kinzo sobbed quietly for a while, wiping away his tears...`
`Because of love,`
` he believed she was Beatrice reborn,`
` and raised her that way.`
`However, somewhere in his heart,`
` ......he might have felt...`
`...pangs of conscience,`
` telling him that he might be forcing his emotions on someone who wasn't really Beatrice.`
`Then, the Beatrice of Kuwadorian had an unexpected guest, Rosa.`
`Unable to believe that she was the Beatrice that Kinzo desired,`
` and suffering from her inability to understand who she was, she expressed a desire to escape to the outside world.`
`Then, ............she fell from the cliff...and died.`
`"Genji handled that death, which couldn't become public knowledge, very quietly."`
`"...................................."`
`"Funerals aren't for the dead.`
` ......They exist so that those who are alive can sever their ties with the dead.`
` ......You could never do that.`
` That's why it festered within you."`
`"......Beatrice......`
`...ooooooooohhhh......"`
`"G‐......Grandfather........."`
`"You lost your mistress's—`
`no, you lost Beatrice twice.`
` Unable to let that sorrow show on the outside, you kept it locked up in your heart,`
` ......and it eventually festered and turned to madness.`
` That's what spurred on your abnormally strong interest in the occult in your later years."`
`"Oooooooooohhhh!!`
` Beatriceeeeee, Beatriceeeeee!!`
` Why?!!`
` Why did you leave me twice?!`
` Your smile,`
` that beautiful hair,`
` those eyes...`
` ......Why did you die in my arms not once,`
` ......but twice?!"`
`"Is that how much...`
`...how much you...`
`......ooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ohhhh,`
` oo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oohhhh...oohhh..."`
`By now, Kinzo wasn't even trying to suppress his sobs.`
`Sometimes, he scratched at his head in anguish;`
` other times, he faced the heavens like an opera singer.`
`Kinzo yelled over and over again, repeating Beatrice's name......`
`At that moment, there was a quiet sound of a door closing.`
`......When they turned around, she was already there.`
`{n}Kumasawa had appeared.`
`".........If they already know that much,`
` perhaps we can tell them the rest...?"`
`"......Though, if they know that much,`
` I don't believe there is anything more to tell..."`
`"No, we should tell them.`
` As a woman,`
` ......I've always thought that the heart of Kuwadorian's Beatrice is a story that should be told.`
` And now, someone has appeared who is worthy to hear it.`
` I believe that now is the time to tell all, without holding back."`
`".............................."`
`"Kumasawa‐san, do you know something?`
` About Beatrice......?"`
`"Of course she does.`
` ......In the fourth game, we have testimony from the ferryboat captain saying that Kumasawa went in and out of Kuwadorian.`
` I'd be willing to bet that Kumasawa had different work shifts at the mansion and Kuwadorian.`
` There was a young girl to be taken care of.`
` Kumasawa, with her long experience in taking care of children, must have been of immense value."`
`".........That is correct.`
` You might even call me her wet nurse."`
`"No way......`
` ......I can't believe it.`
` ......So, ......everything Will‐san is saying is the truth."`
`".........Yes.`
` It is a fact.`
` ......There was a secret mansion constructed on the opposite side of the island for Beatrice‐sama.`
` The existence of Kuwadorian is the truth."`
`"I don't know when Kinzo married his official wife,`
` but back when Kinzo already had an enormous store of wealth and had bought Rokkenjima whole,`
` he built two mansions and set up two separate lives."`
`Kinzo's children had also been aware of Kinzo's clandestine eccentricities at the time.`
`It probably hadn't been easy to set up two lives.`
`{n}Moreover, Kinzo's wife had been suspicious and had sniffed around all the time...`
`"The Master stayed in Kuwadorian as much as time allowed.`
` He would sometimes pretend to go on a business trip and stay there for several days,`
` treasuring the time he spent with Beatrice‐sama.`
` ......It was not simply a father‐daughter relationship.`
` You could sometimes catch a glimpse of his great love for the late Beatrice‐sama, and it was a heart‐warming thing."`
`"The way you say it makes it sound like he sometimes treated her...`
`...as a substitute for Beatrice."`
`"Oho.`
` If it sounded that way, my apologies.`
` ......Beatrice‐sama probably accepted her father's love.`
` However, I will not deny...`
`that she was sometimes forced to bear a love she didn't understand."`
`Kumasawa's tone made it sound as though she was scolding Kinzo.`
`As a mother who had raised many kids, Kumasawa had probably spotted that Kinzo's love was often of a mistaken sort.`
`However, the more the girl grew to look like her mother,`
` the more distorted and twisted Kinzo's heart became......`
`Because of his deep love,`
` it grew very,`
` very...`
`...twisted......`
`".........You are right to scold me, my friend.`
` ............I understand.`
` My love is eternal and undying.`
` ......However, there were times when I directed it at the wrong person, and...`
`...I...`
`...must acknowledge that......"`
`"......Grandfather...`
` .........Wait, ......you don't mean......"`
`"Lion‐sama.`
` All humans in this world are tied to each other.`
` Even if they do not notice, there is always some sort of tie.`
` Those ties......wrap themselves around people and bring them together."`
`"No way...............`
` ............Grandfather..............."`
`Just as Kinzo had done, Lion also wiped away tears and stared down at the floor.`
`Apparently, the truth had been too much of a shock for the young successor to handle...`
`"......My lord.`
` Perhaps the time has come to speak of it."`
`"..............................`
` ......I see.`
` So, that time has come, ......my friend."`
`"Unless you tell us,`
` none of the truth will become clear."`
`".........My lord.`
` ......I believe they may have the qualifications and the right to know."`
`"I know.`
` Perhaps on this day of my fickle funeral, Beatrice in heaven has given me a chance to atone...`
` .........Forgive me for not telling you this before now."`
`After taking a deep breath, Kinzo finally lowered the hands that had been covering his face,`
` ......and looked at Will and Lion with those red eyes.`
`"..........................."`
`"..................Grandfather..."`
`"You listen too, Lion.`
` ......Guest.`
` Willard, was it?"`
`"Yeah."`
`".........I thank you for giving me a chance to speak of the truth while I still am able.`
` ......You must surely be a messenger from heaven sent by Beatrice...`
` ......You have my gratitude........."`
`"Beatrice isn't the one you have to thank.`
` It was some witch.`
` ......Well, I guess they're both witches..."`
`"Hmph, ......I do not care who it was.`
` I have been given a chance.`
` That is enough.`
` ......Thank you, Willard."`
`Kinzo slowly stood up and held out his right hand.`
`{n}He was offering to shake hands.`
`It must have been Kinzo's way of expressing his gratitude...`
`Will responded.`
`{n}Then, the two hands gripped each other tightly in silence.`
`When they did, ......a bright light poured out from the gap between the two hands.`
`"..................nn—"`
`Will felt as though something the size of a grain had burned itself into his palm.`
`......It was that power that {f:5:Bernkastel} had given him.`
`The light grew brighter and brighter.`
`However, it seemed that Kinzo and the others could not see it.`
`"......Now, I will speak.`
` I met Beatrice—`
`Beatrice Castiglioni—just before the end of the war.`
` She came from across the sea......"`
`"................................."`
`"......So, are you Kinzo?"`
`"It's how Grandfather looked in the past.`
` I've seen photos.`
` ......Just what on Earth......"`
`"It's the theatergoing power that {f:5:Bernkastel} gave me.`
` ......Don't try to understand."`
`"I'll just get a headache?"`
`"You're getting the hang of this."`
`At one time, Genji told Battler that he looked like Kinzo in his youth.`
`Sure enough, though the young Kinzo wasn't exactly the same as Battler, they looked very similar.`
`".........Allow me to introduce myself again.`
` ......I am Ushiromiya Kinzo."`
`"Grandfather........."`
`Even the voice seemed to resemble Battler's somehow.`
`Clearly, Battler had inherited Kinzo's blood more thickly than any other...`
`"I did not want to succeed the Ushiromiya family headship.`
` ......My being chosen as the head was nothing more than a prank of fate."`
`"......In the Great Kanto Earthquake, those in charge passed away, and you were selected from the branch families."`
`"That's correct.`
` After all, Grandfather was wise despite his youth, and he already possessed a dignity fitting for the headship."`
`"Fuhahahahahahahaha......`
` Ridiculous.`
` ......Those greedy elders were so intent on looking out for their own personal interests that they couldn't even decide on a new head.`
` They were like fools arguing about who the new captain should be on a sinking ship."`
`"So, since you had no connections with anyone in the main family, you were selected right out of the blue."`
`"It's all because of my toes.`
` If only I'd had one fewer toe on each foot, my life may have turned out quite differently......"`
`In the Ushiromiya family, polydactyly was seen as a sign of good fortune.`
`{n}This was because it was a common factor among many of the greats in the family's history.`
`"It was all very pathetic.`
` The elders didn't care whom they dragged in as long as it wouldn't favor any of them over the others."`
`"So, they just happened to hear that someone in one of the branch families had six toes,`
` and decided that would do well enough."`
`"Precisely.`
` The elders didn't care what sort of novice became the head,`
` as long as they could make him their puppet.`
` In fact, the more ignorant this person was of how to lead, the better it would be for them."`
`"......Grandfather......"`
`"Lion.`
` It is quite different in your case.`
` ......You will be the one who inherits everything I have.`
` That is the fate you were granted on the day of your birth.`
` That is why I gave you that silver ring and raised you so strictly.`
` ......You are quite different from me.`
` You are already a splendid successor, of whom no one could be ashamed......"`
`"...Y‐......yes, sir......"`
`"A puppet heir, huh...`
` ...I doubt that could've been easy."`
`".........Heh,`
` ......hehahahahahahahahaha..."`
`As he pondered about where to begin, Kinzo laughed bitterly.`
`It would probably bring back nothing but painful memories no matter where he started from...`
`"It......lasted for so long, that span of gray days.`
` That mind‐numbing stretch of time I spent dead passed like moss growing on a rock......"`
`I became the rope in the tug of war between the elders, who thought of nothing but their own profit,`
` .....and I probably could have snapped at any moment.`
`However, people are far more resilient than one would think.`
`Though I spent so many days like a dead man, ......I was not killed.`
`So, I would have to search for death on my own......`
`The next thing I knew, I had reached the age when I could no longer refer to myself as "young" without drawing laughter from those who were.`
`They were long, dreary, gray days without any substance.`
`And they lasted for a full twenty years.`
`In twenty years, a person can be born, find a purpose, and even become their own man with their own place in the world.`
`In short, .....if one truly becomes a human only when they have become a working adult...`
`...then I spent an amount of time long enough to create a human...`
`...doing nothing except playing the part of puppet to those greedy old men.`
`Ironically, though that time aged my body, it did not age my mind.`
`In my heart, I was still young,`
` and I looked back fondly on the fulfilling days before I was summoned to Odawara.`
`Only my body continued to age, and at some point, the gulf between the two had widened to the point that it was hard to comprehend.`
`So, I could hardly believe that the worn‐out man in the mirror was really me.`
`No, it really wasn't me.`
`I was the "head of the Ushiromiya family" in name only.`
`I had no rights,`
` no autonomy.`
` There was no need for me to do anything other than what was asked of me.`
`I was just a doll sitting there on the shelf, gathering dust.`
`I remember nothing but lazily flipping through Western books I liked, locking myself in my own world,`
` ......doing nothing but playing with roses and drinking terrible drinks.`
`And it lasted a full twenty years.`
`Before I knew it...`
`...I had a stranger for a wife.`
` ......It wasn't any wife I had chosen.`
`She was someone that the elders had chosen and forced on me for their own reasons, the daughter of some noble family or something,`
` ......but that hardly mattered to me.`
`I did not love my wife, but neither did I dislike her.`
`......I just didn't care.`
`I fathered a few children, but that wasn't out of love for my wife.`
`They were just born before I knew it.`
` ......That's all there was to it.`
`None of it mattered.`
` No, that's not quite right.`
`......Everything was decided by someone other than me, and I simply obeyed.`
`That was the job...`
`......of the "Ushiromiya family head"......`
`"On some level, I felt as though my life was being slowly and quietly snuffed out."`
`"I can't believe it.`
` You have always been praised for being such a bold and wise ruler, and yet you lived like that for so long......"`
`"......Lion.`
` There is nothing so long and insubstantial as a life you do not live for yourself.`
` And yet, it passes in a blink.`
` ......Take this to heart."`
`"A life...you live for yourself......"`
`"Living means having your own will.`
` ......You probably {i:were} dead during that time."`
`"Precisely.`
` I wanted to live.`
` No, I wanted to die.`
` ......What must a puppet do to die?"`
`".....................`
` ......Cut...the strings."`
`"Correct.`
` That would be death, it would be life, and it would be...`
`...release."`
`Before I realized it, the world had grown troubled.`
`World War II.`
` The Pacific War.`
`Japan had extended their war fronts too far to the East and West, and the tide of war was changing.`
`Thanks to the influence of the elders, I was able to avoid conscription.`
`......Of course, this was not out of compassion for me.`
` It was because I was their precious puppet.`
`So, the war never really felt that close to me.`
`{n}However, when I personally decided to abandon their protection, it was very easy.`
`At that time, the Ushiromiya family had almost completely collapsed,`
` and since the elders had apparently pilfered enough of the scraps to last them the rest of their lives,`
` they seemed to care little for what I did, now that they no longer had any use for me.`
`So, I realized that I had finally found my time to die.`
`One by one,`
` I cut the threads I was hanging from,`
` ......and began to search...`
`...for a place to end my life.`
`"So, you searched for death on the battlefield?"`
`"......I thought that if I was going to die anyway, I should try to be of some use to someone.`
` ......No, that's a lie.`
` I probably just lacked the willpower to end my own life.`
` War was a suitable excuse for death."`
`"I heard that your knowledge in public works and construction...`
`led to you being tasked with setting up facilities for the Navy construction team."`
`"Hmph, and what a miscalculation that was.`
` If I had just said that I had no useful skills, I would have been sent to the front lines where I could die at a moment's notice..."`
`"So, you ended up not having to go to the front lines?"`
`"Some of the others were overjoyed at their luck.`
` It was the opposite for me.`
` My only desire was to get my hands on the intoxicating liquor of battle and drink myself to death.`
` ......The US planes did nothing but cut across the skies of that forsaken island.`
` ......They didn't have even a bullet to spare for me, much less a bomb."`
`"Is this the time you met Beatrice, Grandfather......?"`
`"Correct.`
` She came to me from the sea......"`
`"Where did you meet her?`
` You mentioned an island."`
`"It was here.`
` She came to this island."`
`"......So, you met here, on Rokkenjima?"`
`"What's going on...?`
` ......I heard that Rokkenjima was uninhabited until you bought it, Grandfather.`
` I never knew there was a Japanese military base here."`
`"Pft, hahahahahahahaha......`
` Ah, yes, you could hardly call that a military base.`
` It was just a cave.`
` I was one of the guards of that cave."`
`{a:c:1944.}`
`Due to the honorable defeats at Saipan and Guam, Japan's Absolute National Defense Zone strategy was in shambles.`
`Where had the gallantry of the start of the war gone?`
`{n}The old attackers were now the ones on the defensive.`
`At that time, it was said that the final trump cards for the Japanese military were the so‐called "special attack weapons".`
`It was said that these ultimate weapons were packed with 1.55 tons of explosives...`
`and capable of sinking any kind of warship with a single blast.`
`To strengthen homeland defense,`
` the Navy drafted a plan to build a string of hidden bases from Hachijojima to Yokosuka, all to house submarines loaded with special attack weapons.`
`"I knew that there was a base constructed on Hachijojima.`
` To think there was one on Rokkenjima too......"`
`"Just what sort of fool decided it would be a good idea to plant a base on this desolate island, I have no idea.`
` ......To better preserve its secrecy?`
` Hmph, ridiculous.`
` ......I could never understand what the higher‐ups were thinking, and I didn't particularly care."`
`These truly were ultimate weapons, able to take down large warships in a single strike.`
`It was hoped that the presence of submarines capable of loading these weapons in the waters just off of Japan would allow for a powerful sea ambush as a final line of defense.`
`So, to aid in the establishment of a base with absolute secrecy, the uninhabited island Rokkenjima was raised as a possible candidate.`
`An investigation of the island resulted in the discovery of a large cave in the cliffs,`
` and this was apparently deemed to be a suitable location for a submarine base.`
`"So, you were tasked with aiding in the establishment of that base?"`
`"Establishment?`
` Certainly, if you can call digging out a cave "establishment".`
` Not only that, the base was abandoned before its completion."`
`"Why?"`
`"Wahahahahaha!`
` Because at that time, Japan no longer had any submarines large enough to carry one of those weapons.`
` How truly laughable.`
` What's the point in having a submarine base if there aren't any submarines left?`
` If there's one thing that never changes, it's politicians and their meaningless projects."`
`The base on Hachijojima was actually outfitted with those weapons and became a base for direct attacks,`
` but Rokkenjima was never supplied with any.`
`Not only that, they cancelled the construction work entirely,`
` leaving only a crew of minimal size stationed on the island, waiting for orders from above that never came.`
`Could it be the fact that it was a hidden base sealed our fate?`
`The higher‐ups had already completely forgotten about this useless and pointless cavern.`
`We were nothing more than guards for a mere cave.`
`We spent our days farming, fishing, and playing with the dirt,`
` all the while gazing up at the American formations flying past.`
`......Some of our group were relieved at the prospect of the war ending before anyone remembered we were here...`
`and before any of us had to face a real battle.`
`Of course, it was the opposite for me.`
`I hoped beyond hope for the American troops to advance and kill me as soon as possible.`
`And then, on one of those hollow days...`
`Let us go back there now.`
`......Back to the turning point in my life and my fate,`
` ......when Ushiromiya Kinzo finally became alive......`
