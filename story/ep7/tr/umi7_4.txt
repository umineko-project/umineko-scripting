`"Step it up!!`
` What are you doing, slacking off when the fighting's so close?!"`
`Stars seemed to spin around inside my head.`
`I could just lie down on the floor, but that'd only make him more angry.`
`I've no intention of being obedient.`
`......Still, it'd be stupid to get myself punched for no reason, so I got up and stood at attention...`
`"................................."`
`The fighting's close, is it?`
` You really think the American troops are likely to show up on this forgotten island?`
`Then let them come right now.`
`{n}That's what I've been waiting for all this time.`
`"What's this cowardly look you're wearing?!`
` Is this how afraid you are of death?!`
` Are you so scared of those Americans?!`
` You won't be killin' any of them with an attitude like that!!"`
`".............................."`
`They hit me again.`
`......Could you please quit your whining already?`
` Filthy cowards.`
`They give themselves over to this inexplicable anger because it's the only way to distract themselves from their own fear.`
`Heart and spirit aren't any use when the battle becomes hopeless.`
`When trapped by an insurmountable hopelessness, humans rely on several other emotions to escape their fear.`
`These young, inexperienced soldiers found anger to be a very convenient emotion to fall back upon.`
`They did "drills" by shouting in loud voices and swinging their bamboo spears around.`
` Drinking the wine called anger was simply what they needed to do to numb their fear.`
`The more one drinks wine, the more one needs to drink to get drunk.`
`Their useless anger continued to pile up, day after day, without pause.`
`As for me, I did not fear death.`
`So, I had no need of the wine called anger.`
`This made their cowardice all the more apparent to me.`
`"There you go again, that look in your eyes!`
` Ushiromiya, your spirit is rotten to the core!!`
` You're a fish, that's what you are.`
` You've got the eyes of a dead fish!!"`
`However, it went both ways.`
`Just as I was able to spot their cowardice...`
`{n}They were able to pick up on my lethargy.`
`"Is Ushiromiya Kinzo here?!`
` The lieutenant's looking for you!"`
`"Stand up!`
` No slouching about!`
` Double tiiiiime!!"`
`First Lieutenant Yamamoto was the commanding officer in charge of the Rokkenjima garrison.`
`He was just another filthy coward trying to forget his fear with violence,`
` and would reprimand his subordinates for slacking off at the drop of a hat.`
`The stories of his life he'd spout off when in a good mood were all about how much of a thug he had been, ignoring the rules of society.`
`On and on about how so‐and‐so was a prick so he taught them a lesson, or how everyone was so scared of him that he got special treatment.`
`......He kept on talking about what a vile human he was as though it was a badge of honor.`
`Normally, I had nothing to do with this disagreeable lieutenant.`
`He would always hang around with his non‐commissioned subordinates,`
` so as long as I treated him with a snappy salute, I could more or less ignore him for the time being.`
`Now that the construction project on this island had been suspended indefinitely, there was no longer any use for an engineer like me.`
`So, why did the lieutenant ask for me specifically?`
`{n}At that moment, I couldn't think of anything......`
`"Ushiromiya!`
` I hear you're good at speaking foreign languages, is that true?!"`
`"I am proficient in both English and Chinese, sir."`
`The lieutenant liked to brag about his education in front of the non‐commissioned officers,`
` but he held a bit of a grudge against me for being even more highly educated than him.`
`He also felt uncomfortable about having me as a subordinate because he was younger than me,`
` so I was definitely not the kind of person he could hit it off with.`
`Just the fact that I knew several languages must have hurt his pride.`
`"What about Italian, do you speak that?"`
`"I'm afraid not."`
`"So, you wouldn't be much help as an Italian interpreter, then."`
`"It should be possible if one of them speaks English as well, sir."`
`"......Ah, yes, very true!`
` Have you ever talked with a foreigner in English?!"`
`"I have, sir."`
`Why on Earth would he need an interpreter in a cave on an uninhabited island that even our superiors have forgotten?`
`His question made it clear that someone who would need an interpreter would be visiting Rokkenjima.`
`"Good!`
` Ushiromiya, you'll be my interpreter, that's an order!"`
`That evening, I found out exactly what he was talking about.`
`That pointless cavern submarine dock that had never been used...`
`.........was now being approached slowly by a submarine of the Italian Navy.`
`Of course, I knew that the Italians had been our allies.`
`{n}However, this was the first time I had seen anything from their military with my own eyes.`
`"What was the Italian Navy doing here......?`
` Didn't Italy surrender in 1943?`
` What's going on...?"`
`"It was the Kingdom of Italy that surrendered.`
` ......However, the ones who couldn't accept that surrender formed a pro‐German government called the RSI so that they could continue fighting."`
`"The RSI?"`
`"The Italian Social Republic.`
` Also known as the Salò Republic."`
`"You know your history.`
` ......The ignorant often call the Italians cowards, saying that they surrendered first of the Axis powers in 1943.`
` That's not true.`
` The military of the Italian Social Republic fought bravely from the outbreak of war until April 29th, 1945."`
`"And Berlin fell just three days after that.`
` Far from being cowards, they gave one hell of a fight.`
` ......Still, I'm surprised the RSI Navy even had possession of a submarine that could travel all the way to Japan."`
`"......Even if they did, it's a surprise that they'd come out this far at all.`
` ......Why would they come to Japan?`
` To Rokkenjima?"`
`The submarine was both weather‐worn and massive.`
`This dock had never even been used by one of our own country's submarines.`
`I doubt anyone here imagined that it would end up welcoming in one from a far‐off nation.`
`All of the guards of Rokkenjima, of which there were only about thirty, stood at attention as the submarine docked.`
`"......Never seen the Italian military before......"`
`"I heard a mine or some kinda accident trashed their sub."`
`"From what I heard, their ventilation system was hit and they couldn't stop the cabin filling up with chlorine gas."`
`"The lieutenant was hinting about there being something very important in there......"`
`"You mean like a code machine or the blueprints for some new kind of engine?"`
`"I couldn't care less what they're carrying, I'm more surprised that the higher‐ups still remember we exist..."`
`"Move it, Ushiromiya!!`
` How're you supposed to interpret from over there?!!"`
`"Yes, sir......"`
`On top of the hatch was a young Italian saluting us.`
`......Normally, this should have been the job of a commissioned officer, but his clothes looked like those of a sailor,`
` and it really didn't look like he had the dignity and composure of a ship's captain.`
`That probably meant that all of the commissioned officers in charge had died in the accident that had befallen this sub.`
`Crew members crawled out of the hatch one by one, but they all looked pale and entirely worn out.`
`I wasn't sure how long ago the accident had happened,`
` but being crammed together in a tiny sub filled with chlorine gas for any amount of time can't be good for your health.`
`Adding to the problem of the broken ventilation system was the fact that they couldn't afford to travel about carelessly on the surface of the waters around Japan right now.`
`......They had essentially traveled here inside a can of poison gas.`
`Almost all of them were unable to walk without leaning on someone else—it looked like a bunch of people staggering out of a hospital boat.`
`"Ushiromiya!`
` Ask them who the captain is!`
` Tell them that I'm in charge of this island!"`
`"<......Welcome to Japan.`
` Do any of you speak English?>"`
`The crew members seemed to understand that I was speaking English, but it looked as though none of them could speak it.`
`Eventually, someone who seemed to be dressed as an officer saluted.`
`"<Welcome to Japan.`
` Are you the captain?>"`
`"<I cannot speak English>......`
` <Please, wait.>"`
`The officer answered in slow, laborious English.`
`......After asking us to wait, he shouted something to his subordinates in rapid Italian.`
`It looked as though he was telling them to get someone among them who could speak English.`
`"Ushiromiya, what're they talking about?!"`
`"They've asked us to wait.`
` They might be looking for someone there who can speak English."`
`At that moment, I heard a high‐pitched cough.`
`{n}It wasn't a man's cough.`
` ......It was a woman's.`
`"<I speak English.>"`
`As she came down from the hatch, .........a woman with beautiful golden hair said this in English.`
`In this filthy cavern,`
` the appearance of one as beautiful as she was seemed like an angel descending upon us......`
`"<Welcome to Japan.`
` Is the captain there?>"`
`"<The captain is dead.`
` That man over there is the only officer left.>"`
`"<My condolences.`
` Can we do anything to assist you?>"`
`"<Well, we would like some fresh air and water.`
` Some of us are still having trouble breathing.`
` We'd like a place to rest.>"`
`"<We would be happy to help.`
` Do any of the others understand English?>"`
`"<There were some who did, but they're all dead.`
` I'm the only one now.>"`
`"Ushiromiya! What's that woman talking about?!`
` Who's the captain? That man from a second ago?!`
` Who is that woman?! Let's see some translating, dammit!!"`
`The lieutenant wouldn't shut up.`
`......He must have been surprised to see such a beautiful woman appear from the submarine...`
`and more than a little annoyed to see all of her attention focused on me alone.`
`It was a mark......of how divinely beautiful she was.`
`"Sir,`
` it seems that she's the only one who understands English.`
` She will act as their interpreter.`
` Their captain is dead.`
` That officer seems to be acting in his place."`
`"<Who's that loud man who keeps yelling at you?`
` Don't tell me he's your superior.>"`
`"<Yes, unfortunately.`
` He probably doesn't like seeing me have such a beautiful lady all to myself.>"`
`"<Oho.`
` I didn't expect such flattery from an Asian.`
` Your English is superb.`
` I imagine you've been brought up very well.`
` Unlike that rude man who keeps on shouting.`
` They should have made you the officer in charge around here.>"`
`"<Oh?`
` I didn't expect such flattery from a Westerner.>"`
`"<*giggle*!`
` You're an interesting man.`
` What's your name?>"`
`"<Ushiromiya...Kinzo.`
` If you don't mind, may I ask for your name as well?>"`
`"<Beatrice Castiglioni.>"`
`"<Welcome, Beatrice.`
` Welcome to Japan.>"`
`That was when I first met Beatrice, the woman who would capture my heart for the rest of my life......`
`"......So, Beatrice was an Italian."`
`"Yes.`
` She was the daughter of a high‐ranking RSI official.`
` Apparently, their most important cargo was her father himself.`
` ......Sadly, he had already died by the time they reached Rokkenjima."`
`"Why would a high official like that come to Japan?`
` You're saying he went through the Suez Canal and crossed the Indian Ocean to come all the way here?"`
`"That's a good point.`
` If they wanted to reach one of their allies, Germany should have been much closer.`
` ......So, why would they make the long trip to Japan?"`
`".........It may have been part of some grand, outrageous strategy.`
` ......I don't know all the details,`
` but shortly after, I learned that this submarine's mission was far from a minor one..."`
`They said that there had been about sixty of them at the time of their departure.`
`However, only about ten of them, including Beatrice, had survived.`
`Their submarine had apparently hit a mine or something in the nearby waters and sustained a great deal of damage.`
`They told us that it had flooded rapidly with water, which had taken out the batteries and released a large amount of chlorine gas.`
`Their sub had become completely incapable of continuing further,`
` nothing but a massive lump of metal floating in the dock.`
`Since the sub seemed to be carrying "something of immense value",`
` the higher‐ups ordered us to investigate.`
`After questioning the Italians, with Beatrice and me acting as double interpreters,`
` we concluded that this thing of immense value must have been her father himself.`
`Apparently, Beatrice's father was extremely high up in the RSI hierarchy,`
` and it was thought that he might have worked alongside the Italian Prime Minister himself.`
`Though their massive voyage had apparently been part of some top‐secret mission, now that the man himself and all of the commissioned officers had died,`
` their reason for coming to Japan remained a mystery.`
`And, since the higher‐ups were telling us to investigate, that meant that even they didn't know what it was.`
`Their ship had broken down, their mission was unknown, and the high official they had been carrying was dead.`
`{n}And even the Japanese government didn't know why they were here.`
`......The Italians' great and perilous voyage...`
`...had come to a meaningless and utterly fruitless end...`
`"<That's a relief.`
` I always assumed the Japanese ocean air would smell like soy sauce.>"`
`"<What a coincidence.`
` I've always thought Italians had hair made of pasta.>"`
`"<Of course we do.`
` You don't know how hard it is to get that perfect al dente texture.`
` I imagine you Japanese all wear spaghetti al nero?>"`
`"<Oh, you know quite a lot, I see.`
` In Japan, we like to use squid ink instead of shampoo.>"`
`"<*giggle*!`
` You really are amazing, Kinzo.`
` It seems you know everything!`
` Have you ever been to Italy?>"`
`"<Never.`
` I have read a lot of your books, though.>"`
`"<An Asian man reading Italian books?!`
` Wow, what kinds of books?>"`
`"<Niccolò Machiavelli.`
` And Dante Alighieri.`
` So, I know of course that you are the eternal lady.>"`
`"<Oh, what a surprise...`
` You must be quite the bookworm.`
` Does this mean you came from some Japanese noble family?>"`
`"<.........Who knows?>"`
`"<You're completely different from those other savage‐looking Japanese soldiers.`
` I can tell!`
` You must've come from a noble family.`
` Are the Ushiromiyas some sort of Japanese aristocrats?>"`
`"<......Of course not.`
` They just managed to strike it rich in the spinning industry in recent generations.`
` I didn't study to prepare myself for nobility or anything like that.`
` ......I just wasn't allowed to do anything else.`
` Reading books, playing around with roses,`
` and getting myself drunk were the only ways I had to occupy myself.>"`
`Beatrice hadn't asked that question out of malice.`
`{n}It had just been a curious question asked to a friend from a faraway country.`
`However, ......Beatrice was from a noble family herself, so she could tell.`
`......She could see the faint gloomy look on Kinzo's face.`
`"<Forgive me, Kinzo.`
` I was so surprised that a high‐class person like you would be a simple soldier in a place like this...`
`...that I didn't stop to think about why.>"`
`"<I don't really care about my family line.`
` The name Ushiromiya will mean nothing when I'm dead.`
` And that will be what finally sets me free.>"`
`"<.........So, you joined the army because you wanted to die?`
` You mustn't do that.`
` Your family would be so sad.>"`
`"<Family?`
` ......I have no family.>"`
`I have a wife for the sake of public appearances...and children.`
`{n}However, I've never wanted any of them.`
`......Everything, everything......is a fleeting daydream created by selfish, greedy old men.`
`......So, at least being stuck on this island, I can forget about all of that......and find some peace.`
`Peace.........?`
`But haven't I spent each and every day complaining that I wasn't sent to the front and haven't managed to die yet......?`
`"<......I can't understand the pain you're going through, but I do realize that my thoughtless words have hurt you.`
` Forgive me, Kinzo.>"`
`Forgive me, Kinzo.`
`Ohh, those words...I think...they set me free.`
`All of the Japanese people call me Ushiromiya.`
`......Every time I hear it, it's a constant reminder that I'm the property of the Ushiromiya family.`
`But she is different.`
`{n}She calls me...Kinzo.`
` Not Ushiromiya.`
`So maybe.........just for the time I chat with her like this,`
` ......I can forget that cursed family.`
`"<............Kinzo.>"`
`I hadn't meant to make Beatrice feel guilty,`
` but she seemed certain that her thoughtless words had hurt me.`
`"<Thank you.>"`
`"<Huh?>"`
`"<You calling me "Kinzo" makes me feel like I can finally be my own man.`
` ......I think...that I've finally met a person who truly sees me for who I am.>"`
`"<Kinzo.`
` You may be a foreigner I met in a distant land,`
` ......but I know your heart is very sensitive and beautiful.`
` If we had grown up in the same neighborhood, I'm sure we'd have become quick friends.>"`
`"<......I'm happy too.`
` You always call me Beatrice.`
` Not "the daughter of the Castiglioni family".>"`
`We were both in the same position.`
`Her Castiglioni family must have been a rigid place as well.`
`......Though we came from different countries, we had finally found something we could truly understand about each other.`
`"<Do you have a nickname that people close to you use?>"`
`"<No.`
` They would just call me Kinzo.>"`
`"<Well then, you should stop calling me Beatrice.`
` All of my close friends used to call me Bice.`
` I'd like you to call me that too.>"`
`"<Very well.`
` From this point onwards, I will call you Bice as a sign of our friendship.>"`
`"<Ah, come on.`
` You can't talk all stiff like that.`
` We're friends now, okay?>"`
`A bright smile stretched across Beatrice's face......`
`"No matter how many decades pass,`
` ......that smile will never fade from my memory......"`
`"......So, by meeting Beatrice, you managed to regain your sense of self."`
`"Or, as most people would put it, he cheated on his wife.`
` .........Nggyaahh, ggrrrrkkk......"`
`"If you plan to continue being rude, I suggest you get in the habit of covering your butt."`
`After having his butt pinched once more, Will hopped around in pathetic agony...`
`"So, in your eyes, Grandfather, Rokkenjima was...`
`always special for being the place you first met Beatrice."`
`".........Mm.`
` ...If I had never come to this island, I would never have met her... It truly is an island of miracles..."`
`"Is there anything left of that submarine base today?"`
`"Yes, it's still there, close to Kuwadorian.`
` It's in the shadows of a cove that can't be seen from the outside.`
` After all, fishermen never approach this supposedly ill‐omened island.`
` It is unlikely that anyone besides me still knows of its existence."`
`"Is the two‐kilometer‐long underground passage between Kuwadorian and the mansion a remnant of that base?"`
`"That is correct.`
` There was some nonsense about carving a network of tunnels out of the limestone caverns...`
`which would connect a number of bunkers across the island.`
` I made use of those tunnels and had two mansions built, one at each end of the island."`
`"Two mansions, two families.`
` ......The Ushiromiya family mansion, ......and the mansion for "Kinzo", released from the shackles of the Ushiromiya family."`
`"............Correct.`
` ......It was something I needed.`
` ......A place for me to escape from the cursed name of Ushiromiya."`
`"...................................."`
`"<Still, I do feel bad for you.`
` It must be awful to have come all the way out here and been unable to fulfill your mission.>"`
`"<I don't really know what Papa's plan was.`
` He said that we needed to run far away to hide "it" until the time came.>"`
`"<And what is "it"?>"`
`"<I don't know.`
` ......‘It’ was something very important,`
` and he planned to hide it for many years until the right moment.`
` Oh, and he planned for us to remain hidden along with it.`
` I know because he apologized to me that I might be spending a very long time on foreign soil.>"`
`"<Didn't Ensign Angelo say that you had no cargo in particular,`
` and that you were transporting your father instead?>"`
`"<The ensign doesn't trust you or the others.`
` Even I know a few things he's kept hidden from you.`
` ......He might even know what Papa's goal was...and what the cargo is.>"`
`"<Whatever it is, that's a mission for the Italian military.`
` It has nothing to do with us.`
` In fact, given that we're allies,`
` we'd be willing to help if only they asked.>"`
`"<I have no doubts that you're a good person, Kinzo.`
` I've even told Ensign Angelo that you're a man we can trust, but...`
` ......Why is it that men always get so rigid and uptight when they're in a strange land?>"`
`"<Normally, they're all very bright and cheery people.`
` Ever since we came here, there's been this strange feeling of tension.`
` ......Ensign Angelo has ordered that his subordinates be armed at all times.`
` It's almost as though we're in enemy territory.>"`
`That was true.`
`The Italians were clearly the very opposite of relaxed.`
`The Japanese soldiers, watching this, began to suspect that the Italians didn't really trust them at all.`
`"<That's normal for a soldier.`
` This is precisely the time for them to straighten up their guard, so they don't embarrass themselves in front of a friendly army.>"`
`"<They have a person stand watch every time they sleep,`
` and they're still keeping a lookout to make sure none of you approach the submarine, even though it's nothing more than an unusable scrap heap now.`
` It almost feels as though they're acting openly hostile towards the Japanese, and that bothers me.>"`
`True, they had set up a constant sentry by the submarine and had refused to let any of the Japanese soldiers come near.`
`This hadn't made the Japanese particularly happy.`
`......However, submarines are treated as classified in all countries.`
`Maybe it was just natural for them to stop foreigners from approaching it without reason.`
`"<They're probably uncomfortable with being made to live in a way they aren't used to.`
` ......That boat which is supposed to take you back to the mainland is still being delayed by weather and problems up the command chain.`
` Just how long will it take before they can send you there...>"`
`We had been told that a boat was being sent for them directly from the mainland,`
` but apparently, thanks to the weather, problems up the command chain, and the recent air raids,`
` there were no ships to spare for a forgotten island like this.`
`There might have been some sort of diplomatic problem.`
`......After all, their homeland had already surrendered to the Allies.`
`......I didn't know the details.`
`The only thing I knew for sure...`
`was that they'd been stuck on Rokkenjima for two whole weeks and no one had come to get them.`
`Of course, we had some small boats on Rokkenjima.`
`{n}There was nothing physically stopping us from taking them to a nearby island.`
`Still, Rokkenjima was technically a top‐secret base, and contact with the outside world had been strictly forbidden...`
`"<Well, nothing we can do about it, and it isn't all that bad, really.`
` After all, if a boat did come for us, I'd probably never see you again, Kinzo.>"`
`"<.........True.>"`
`To me, those two weeks......were the first I'd ever truly {i:lived}.`
`The faint twenty years before all seemed to vanish in the sparkle of those two weeks.`
`......I realized that she would have to leave this place eventually.`
`And yet, this one moment felt so rich and dazzling...`
`...that I felt myself wishing it could last forever......`
`Then, I heard a voice calling for Beatrice in Italian.`
`"<......It's Ensign Angelo.`
` Looks like he wants you for something.>"`
`"<Probably to scold me.`
` These days, he keeps yapping on about how I shouldn't get too friendly with the Japanese soldiers.>"`
`The ensign approached, saluting Kinzo,`
` and after glancing at Beatrice as though asking her to translate something, he began to speak in Italian.`
`Judging by his tone, it sounded like something serious.`
`"<......Ensign Angelo has something very important to say, so he wants to talk with your commanding officer.`
` ......He seeks assistance with something.`
` I don't know what.>"`
`"<Something important...?`
` Got it.`
` I'll go find Lieutenant Yamamoto.>"`
`Ensign Angelo had two of his subordinates with him and wore a stern expression on his face.`
`They didn't have to say anything for us to realize that this must be something very serious......`
`"That's it!!`
` Lift it up!!"`
`The winch creaked and the thick chains rang out with a dull clang.`
`Very, very slowly, ......{i:it} was lifted up out of the submarine's cargo hold.`
`"......Now I get it!`
` ......So this is why those Italians didn't want us near their sub...!"`
`The lieutenant and the others looked up at what the winch was slowly lifting up,`
` ......all of them wearing unpleasant, forced smiles......`
`"<.........Unbelievable...`
` ......So this is what Papa brought all this way...?>"`
`"<I‐......incredible......`
` ......I've never seen anything like this......>"`
`It was...a mountain of gold ingots.`
`Those carefully piled bars were being slowly lifted out of the cargo hold, one group after another......`
`This gold had been their true cargo.`
`I don't know where they were planning to take it.`
`They might have been trying to sneak it into Japan, one of their allies,`
` ......or they might have been on their way to hide it in some remote area.`
`Was it some sort of strategy?`
` A conspiracy? Embezzlement?`
` Top‐secret transportation of wealth?`
`This incomprehensible amount of gold led to all sorts of dark suspicions, but we didn't know anything about the truth.`
`All told, the gold weighed an incredible ten tons.`
`{n}That was the only truth we could wrap our minds around at the moment......`
`They had strongly resisted showing this to us.`
`{n}However, the submarine could no longer make sea, and it was apparently continuing to take in water bit by bit.`
`Rokkenjima had been outfitted in an extremely slipshod way, so we had no means of repairing it.`
`Also, while we could unload the sub, there was no way we could lift it up again once it had filled with water and sunk to the bottom.`
`It was clear that unless action was taken, the gold would soon become completely impossible to transport.`
` ............And so, they had made the decision to unload it.`
`Of course, they made no effort to explain the reason for all this gold.`
`{n}They just asked us to help them take it out......`
`"<Why would they take so much gold out of the country...?`
` Couldn't they have changed the course of the war with this much wealth...?>"`
`"<......Weapons change the course of war,`
` but after the war, they aren't useful for anything.`
` ......Money may also change the course,`
` but it remains just as valuable after the war.>"`
`There was no longer any way to change the course of this war.`
`{n}The Axis powers would probably all surrender, leading to an Allied victory.`
`Anyone could tell this simply by looking at the American planes flying across the sky day after day.`
`However, gold would still be valuable after the war was over.`
`Everyone stared upwards,`
` dumbfounded...`
`...as the winch slowly lifted the dully sparkling gold......`
