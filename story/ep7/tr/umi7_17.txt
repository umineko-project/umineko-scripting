`Quadrillion.`
`There's only one place you'll find that word on Rokkenjima.`
`Gold butterflies flitted from shadow to shadow, dodging raindrops.`
`"......Unless my memory is mistaken, this is probably the place."`
`It was......the chapel.`
`{n}That mysterious building, one of the oldest on Rokkenjima, which had been built at the same time as the mansion.`
`It was called the chapel, but not once had Kinzo used it for worship, and the members of the family had never been allowed inside.`
`There were strict orders that none approach it without reason, and its purpose was always a mystery.`
`However, any mystery will lose its luster after several decades.`
`At some point, everyone forgot the chapel even existed,`
` and that splendid building passed from the thoughts of Rokkenjima's residents......`
`Of course, this had been true for Beato as well.`
`Beato, who hated boredom, had no desire to approach places that humans never went.`
`Her last memory of the place was of the time she went in there to taunt Shannon as she tried to clean.`
`"......There can be no doubt.`
` That is it.`
` ......Quadrillion."`
`Beato looked up......above the door of the chapel.`
`{n}There was a relief displayed over an arch.`
`English words were written there.`
`"‘You will be blessed only at a probability of a Quadrillion to one’.`
` .........Heheh.`
` So, you thought that was the probability of someone solving this riddle...?"`
`This chapel was built long ago.`
`If there is a mechanism like the one I imagine,`
` ......Kinzo must have prepared that epitaph riddle many decades ago.`
`He must have been planning to use it as a ritual for choosing a fitting successor all this time.`
`......However, that ritual is now a ritual to open the door to the Golden Land and to my resurrection.`
`When I snapped my fingers,`
` the ground bulged, and several dead trees sprouted out of it, curving and twisting like snakes.`
`They twisted around each other to form a ladder, which leaned itself against the door.`
`"If my guess is right, ......there's some sort of mechanism in that relief."`
`I slowly climbed the ladder.`
`Because of the size of the door, the relief was very high up.`
`This close up, it looks much bigger than it did from the ground.`
`"............Come to think of it, whenever we cleaned the chapel,`
` ......this relief was the only thing that Genji always made sure he polished himself.`
` ......I always wondered why he didn't leave something so trivial to the younger servants."`
`I thought it strange, but nothing more.`
`The Master treasured this relief, so the head servant cared for it himself.`
` ......I always accepted that excuse.`
`But now, I understand.`
`{n}There must be a trick to this relief.`
`And Genji polished it himself to make sure that no one else accidentally found out......`
`"So, from this Quadrillion, I am to sacrifice the six letters chosen by the key......?"`
`I prodded and played with the letter "Q".`
`My fingertips were soon covered with dust.`
` However, I quickly realized that something felt strange about it.`
`"......Don't tell me this letter...`
` ......No, ......it had to be like this.`
` There would be no other way to offer up sacrifices......"`
`Beato grabbed hold of the letter "Q", and after experimenting with different levels of force,`
` ......the letter came out with a scraping sound.`
`"Just......as I thought........."`
`Here's the "Q" I pulled out.`
` And there's a wedge—no.`
` It's a key.`
`A key was attached to the back of the "Q", and that had been stuck into a keyhole in the relief.`
`"......I see......`
` In that case, I know what to do next.`
` ......Very good, this "Q" key is a wrong answer.`
` Away with you."`
`Beato carelessly tossed the "Q" key aside.`
`This was the first sacrifice.`
`She kept on pulling out the keys for the six letters representing "the key".`
`"......So, "a" will also be sacrificed.`
` ......And both "i"s.`
` ......And then the "n" at the end."`
`"Now, I only sacrifice one "l", ......but unfortunately, there are two "l"s here."`
`There were two "l"s.`
` I didn't know which I should sacrifice.`
`I tried pulling both out, but the keys were of different shapes.`
`So, one is a right answer, and one is a wrong answer.`
`"Well, there are only two.`
` ......If I make a mistake, I can just try the other one."`
`Unless messing up sets off a trap that blows up the island, of course.`
`Thinking it a waste of time to sit here worrying, I decided on the "l" on the right and pulled it out.`
`Five letters remained in the word.`
`"And now, the first twilight is over.`
` ......On to the second twilight."`
`On the second twilight, those who remain shall tear apart the two who are close.`
`"The "d" and "r" are close.`
` What does it mean to tear them apart...?`
` Do I pull them out?"`
`But if I do, there will only be three letters left.`
`By this point, I was able to make a good guess at what the "gouge and kill" lines from the fourth twilight onwards meant.`
`"Gouge and kill probably means to turn the keys and take them out.`
` In that case, the parts about going from head to leg must mean starting at the left and going right."`
`If that's the case, five letters have to remain on the board.`
`{n}In other words, "tear apart" doesn't mean kill.`
`"If so, then we can read "tear apart" to mean putting a gap between the "d" and the "r".`
` ......But how?`
` Once again, there are two ways to do it..."`
`Do I remove the "d" and move it to the left?`
`{n}Do I remove the "r" and move it to the right?`
`......After pondering this for some time, I realized that both choices were wrong.`
`"No.`
` That's not right.`
` I've had it wrong since I removed that "l"."`
`A short while ago, I removed the right of the two "l"s.`
`{n}However, if I had removed the left one...`
`......It would look like this.`
`If you line it up this way, it's easy to see the next step.`
`{n}The "r" gets shifted to the right.`
`This way, all of the letters are spread out evenly.`
`{n}This must be it.`
`"And this next part......is another tough one.`
` ......Praise my name...?"`
`It's already clear that this is a word game.`
`Those who remain shall praise my noble name.`
`I am supposed to do something with the remaining five letters.`
` Most likely, rearrange them.`
`"......‘u’, "d", "r", "l", "o"...`
` ......Can I do something with these five letters to give them some sort of meaning?"`
`Praise...my name.`
`"Gh.`
` ......How can I get stuck after coming so far......?`
` How are these five letters supposed to praise a name...?!"`
`That man's name is Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
`{n}Is the "u" part of Ushiromiya......?`
`No, several letters don't match, and there aren't nearly enough letters to make Ushiromiya...`
`"One thing that is certain... "My name" must refer to Kinzo.`
` ......Then, does the "u" stand for Ushiromiya after all?`
` Like an initial.`
` ......Then what do the "d", "r", "l", and "o" stand for?`
` They can't mean Kinzo.`
` Do the "r" and "o"......stand for Rokkenjima...?`
` The master of Rokkenjima, Kinzo......`
` ......Hmm, not nearly enough letters......"`
`This riddle left me totally confused.`
`{n}However, there were only five letters left.`
`There can't be so many possible combinations of those letters.`
` I could use process of elimination.`
`Thinking I'd play around with it, I pulled out the "u".`
`......There were four letters left.`
` "d", "r", "l", and "o".`
`"...................................."`
`My idea that the "u" stood for Ushiromiya was like a heavenly oracle.`
`When I removed the "u", I thought of making a word with the remaining four letters.`
`"d", "r", "l", and "o".`
`Those four letters spun around in my head, changing their orders,`
` ......and led me to a single English word that would serve to "praise" Kinzo...`
`"It's lord.`
` ......Lord...!"`
`I had absolutely no basis for it.`
` ......However, it was like a flash of inspiration.`
`I quickly changed the letters around before that flash faded from my mind.`
`"‘l’, "o", "r", "d"!`
` Lord!`
` "u"!`
` Ushiromiya!`
` ......Lord Ushiromiya! How do you like that?!"`
`"On the fourth twilight, .........gouge the head...`
`.........oho?!"`
`It was a key, so it wouldn't turn if it was the wrong one.`
`But it did turn.`
` I could gouge it...!`
`With a sound of scraping stone, I gouged the first letter, the "l", ......and then pulled it out.`
`"Next! The fifth twilight...!`
` Gouge the chest......and kill......!"`
`The "o" was gouged and pulled out easily.`
`Then, the "r".`
` Next, the "d".`
` And finally, the "u".`
`When I turned the key of the "u", I could feel a resistance, as though some mechanism had been activated.`
`I waited for something to change, ......but nothing did.`
`However, I had felt something happen.`
`{n}A secret door or something must have opened up somewhere around here.`
`......Waiting around won't accomplish anything.`
`I've probably done everything I can here......`
`All of the letters in "Quadrillion" had been removed.`
`"On the ninth twilight, ......the witch revives, and none shall be left alive......"`
`So now...has the witch...have I...revived......?`
`The tenth twilight.`
`{n}The journey ends, and you shall reach the Home of the Gold......`
`When I stepped down off the ladder and looked around,`
` ......I immediately noticed that small change.`
`"......That lion statue............"`
`At some point, the lion statue in front of the chapel had turned to face a different direction.`
`......What an elaborate mechanism...!`
`Did Kinzo plan up this extravagant device back when he first started building on this island......?`
`I walked up to the lion statue and stared at it.`
`{n}Other than the fact that it was pointing a different direction, nothing had changed.`
`{n}In that case, is the lion looking at something in particular now......?`
`I followed its line of sight.........and saw another lion statue.`
`And that lion statue had also changed its direction.`
`"I see......`
` So, let the lions guide you.`
` ......As elaborate as ever, I see, Kinzo."`
`I wasn't complaining anymore.`
`......I felt a bit of respect and awe at Kinzo for setting up such an intricate device...`
`and having it go undiscovered for all these years.`
`There were lion statues standing like guards at the entrance and the corners of the chapel.`
`The direction they faced had changed, pointing around to the back of the chapel.`
`There was something there.`
`"....................................`
` ............Hoh........."`
`It was no longer a surprise.`
`This was after the mechanism in the relief.`
` After being guided by the lions.`
`So, when a gaping open secret passageway appeared, .........with stairs leading down to the darkness below, ......it wasn't surprising to me anymore.`
`"So, .........is this the entrance to the Golden Land, Kinzo......?!!"`
`".........Did you find it...?`
` Grandfather's......gold......?"`
`"Yes.`
` .........At the end of my long, long journey......was the Golden Land."`
`"According to the previous games, there was an underground VIP room there, along with ten tons of gold, right?"`
`"Yes.`
` After going down a rough stairway, ......there was a door at the end of the passage.`
` Inside, it was beautifully furnished, a true VIP room."`
`"......And was the gold all you found there?"`
`"Yes, at the time......`
` It would be a lie to say that I was not dizzied by the sight of all that gold stacked high..."`
`"............Is this...`
`...real......?"`
`I lightly touched the pile of gold with my finger.`
`{n}It was hard...and cold.`
`I had almost thought that it might crumble like a sandcastle if I touched it.`
`Now, there could be no doubt.`
`{n}This certainly was......a ten ton pile of gold ingots.`
`"......Haha,`
` ...............ha......"`
`Considering the amount of gold I had just found, I figured I ought to be crying out in delight.`
`......I didn't really feel like laughing, but I thought it only good manners to do so in a situation like this,`
` so I forced it out.`
`Because of this, only a few feeble laughs slipped from my mouth.`
`At that moment, even stronger than any delight...`
`was a feeling as though I'd entered a place I wasn't supposed to be...`
`For a while, all I could do was stand there shocked, unsure what I should do now that the epitaph's riddle had been completed.`
`Then, I heard approaching footsteps.`
`They were coming from the stairway I had entered by.`
`Someone was coming.`
` Could it be...Kinzo?`
`If he finds out I've been in a place like this, won't I get scolded harshly......?`
`I thought about hiding and pretending this never happened, but my legs wouldn't move.`
`I kept standing there, stunned, in front of the pile of gold......as the footsteps drew closer and closer...`
`".................................!"`
`The door opened, ......and I saw who it was.`
`......It............wasn't Kinzo.`
`"................................."`
`".........You......"`
`"......Did you reach this place by your power alone?"`
`"I‐......indeed..."`
`"................................."`
`For some time, Genji stared at Beato in silence, as though he was calculating something.`
`Then, he slowly clapped his hands together.`
` ......He did it again, over and over.`
`It took quite a long time before I realized that he was applauding me...`
`"The Master has said that he will hand over the gold and the headship to the first person who solves the epitaph.`
` ......And, he believed that this person would be {f:5:Beatrice}..."`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}......`
` .........Me......?"`
`"This is fate.`
` .........It is fate that brought you to this day."`
`".............................."`
`I didn't really understand what Genji was saying.`
`The shock of seeing the gold still had me paralyzed...`
`"......Come this way."`
`"O‐okay......"`
`Genji opened a closet.`
`Inside it was a dress form wearing a beautiful dress made of black cloth and golden stitching.`
`When I saw it, I understood immediately.`
`......It was the witch's dress.`
`The black dress worn by the {f:5:Beatrice} in the portrait......`
`"Change into this."`
`"......This is.........."`
`"It is something that.........you once wore."`
`I've never worn a dress like this.`
` However, I understood what Genji meant.`
`This dress was one that {f:5:Beatrice} once wore.`
`And the one who shows a miracle by solving the epitaph is {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`By reaching this room, .........I had succeeded the position of the real {f:5:Beatrice},`
` the one in the portrait.`
`Why do I call myself {f:5:Beatrice}?`
`Because the name of the Golden Witch who rules over Rokkenjima's night is {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......That's right.`
` I was never the real {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`I was a different witch, stealing the name of the witch from Kinzo's delusions.`
`And now, ......I have become the real {f:5:Beatrice}......`
`By solving the epitaph's riddle, I would achieve my resurrection.`
`{n}......I was the one who decided on that rule, or so I thought...`
`But as it turns out, ......this really {i:was}.........a ritual to resurrect {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`I believed that I could create my own fate with magic.`
`{n}I was a master of that magic, ......yet fate had led me here by the hand...`
`At this moment, I was forced to truly accept and believe in this word called "fate"...`
`"And after I put this on.........?"`
`"......You will go to the Master.`
` Ready yourself."`
`".........Wait here."`
`"......O‐...okay."`
`"My lord.`
` It is Genji."`
`After Genji knocked, the sound of the study's door unlocking could be heard.`
`After a single glance telling me to wait, Genji entered alone.`
`"I cannot believe that this day has come......`
` Fate can be such a strange thing......"`
`Kumasawa was with us too.`
`I thought this dress, which didn't really suit me, would lead to a lot of jokes, ......but she didn't laugh at me at all.`
`On the contrary, when she saw me, ......her expression had turned stern, as though a long‐awaited day had finally come.`
`......My heart raced.`
`It wasn't supposed to matter who solved the epitaph.`
` There shouldn't be anything strange about me solving it......`
`Everyone else maintained solemn expressions, ......and that, along with everything else, made this feel like some sort of grand ceremony.`
`The suffocating silence continued.`
`Eventually, the door opened, and Genji peeked out.`
`".........Please enter,`
` .........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`He was saying those words to me, ......but not to the person I had been until a short while ago.`
`"....................."`
`"Go ahead,`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama..."`
`Kumasawa also urged me forward with a respectful bow.`
`{n}Kinzo was probably waiting for me inside.`
`What expression should I wear as I go in...?`
` How should I greet him...?`
`{n}I don't have a clue...`
`As the two of them motioned me forward, it was all I could do to avoid tripping over my dress as I walked.`
`".........Kinzo‐san.`
` She is here."`
`Kinzo was before the portrait of {f:5:Beatrice}, crouched on the ground as though kneeling.`
`At Nanjo's words, he slowly turned, still crouching...`
`"...............Oh...`
` .........Oohhhhhh........."`
`Kinzo's eyes were already red with crying.`
`{n}When he saw me, he groaned with wonder.`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}......`
` .........{f:5:Beatrice}........."`
`Had he even forgotten how to stand up?`
`{n}He crawled over to where I was.`
`...As he called out to me with the name of the woman he had loved long ago.`
`I was too stunned to move.`
`Then, Kinzo grabbed the hem of my dress, gripped it tightly, ......then curled up and sobbed.`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}......`
` ......I'm sorry. I'm so sorry......`
` I knew how you felt, ......and yet I......`
` I'm so sorry...... Forgive me...... Forgive me, I beg you......"`
`"...................................."`
`There was nothing I could say.`
` However, just standing here like this was all I needed to do.`
`Kinzo's moment of atonement, the moment he had spent half of his life searching for, had finally come.`
`......A human's life is packed with sin.`
`So, humans seek forgiveness while they still live.`
` However, in most cases, there are none in this world capable of giving such forgiveness.`
`It was like that for Kinzo.`
` There was no longer anyone in the world who could give that to him.`
`{n}......But a miracle had woven one together, and in this moment, he had obtained the impossible...`
`"Oooohhhh, {f:5:Beatrice}...`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice}......`
` ...You need not forgive me, you need not say anything...!`
` All I ever wanted......was to say one word......of apology......!`
` {nobr:Oooohhhhhh.........}"`
`Kinzo kept grasping the dress's hem and sobbing.`
`The sins of humans are not forgiven by other people.`
`{n}They find forgiveness through regret and repentance.`
`......I want to believe that some sin, some fault of his......has been forgiven thanks to the way I look...`
`Kinzo's sobbing gradually ceased,`
` ......and he slowly looked up at me and rose.`
`He staggered.`
` Nanjo rushed forward to support him.`
`"................................."`
`".........To know.........that you are alive......`
` ......It brings me such...joy......"`
`This time, his words weren't directed through me, but at me.`
`{n}I hesitated, unsure how I should respond.`
`"......My lord, I beg your forgiveness for keeping this a secret from you all this time."`
`"No matter.`
` ......I do not fault you, Genji...`
` ......Considering the sin that I committed, ......every single day until now has been necessary for my atonement......"`
`"However, there can be no doubt that today's miracle is a true one.`
` ......By her own power, without anyone's help,`
` ......she solved the epitaph before anyone else."`
`"You did well.........to solve that convoluted epitaph......"`
`"Th‐.........thanks......"`
`"......Yes.`
` ......Your voice resembles your mother's.`
` Even your face reminds me of that mother and daughter......`
` ...There can be no doubt that {f:5:Beatrice}'s blood flows through your veins......"`
`"Yes.`
` ......The traces of the lady of Kuwadorian in her youth are right there."`
`Who......are they saying I look like......?`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama,`
` please forgive me for keeping what I am about to tell you a secret for all this time.`
` You are the child of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama and the Master."`
`"........................What......?"`
`"It's true.`
` ......You have been raised as a child without parents.`
` However, your true father is the Master.`
` And your true mother......is {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"......Is that, ......umm, ......really............?"`
`"Yes.`
` You truly are a descendant of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`Is such a strange fate.........really possible......?`
`I've dreamed about it.`
` Dreamed about what it'd be like to be the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`But that dream was for me alone.`
`So, I'd dreamed that if I solved the epitaph,`
` ......and carried out its ritual, I would revive as the true {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`......Is it really conceivable...`
`...that after I solved it...`
`...{f:5:Beatrice} actually did revive......?`
`"I...`
`...truly carry...`
`......{f:5:Beatrice}'s...`
`......blood......?"`
`"Yes.`
` There is no doubt of that whatsoever."`
`"......It must have been hard for you to live until this day without knowing a parent's affection...`
` ......And yet, look at how wonderfully you've grown......"`
`"......So, ......you all knew.........?`
` About me......?"`
`Genji, Kumasawa, and even Nanjo nodded wordlessly.`
`......Now that I think about it, that explains so many things.`
`I was always...in some way...special.`
`{n}Genji and especially Kumasawa always treated me very kindly.`
`Then, ......does that mean this day is a promised day, which would eventually have come no matter what......?`
`I don't understand anything anymore.`
`It's all God's miracle.`
`The promised fate has led me to this day.`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ............No,`
` .........Lion."`
`"...............?"`
`"That is the name I wanted to give you......"`
`"......It is your true name."`
`"Lion......`
` I will now return to you everything that {f:5:Beatrice} gave me.`
` ......I return to you the gold, as well as everything of the Ushiromiya family, which was created by it."`
`Kinzo stuck out a wrinkled hand.`
`On his finger was a ring with the One‐winged Eagle crest, which was the symbol of the Ushiromiya family head.`
`He pulled it off, grasped it tightly, and then held it out to me.`
`......I didn't know what to do.`
`Slowly, as though they were being drawn forward, ......I held out my hands, palms up.`
`After pressing his fist against my cupped hands, Kinzo slowly opened his hand and let the ring drop.`
`".........Lion, my child.........`
` ......That your fate has been toyed with is a result of my sin.`
` ......Please forgive me...`
` ......You now inherit my ring as the new and proper head of the Ushiromiya family."`
`"All of that gold belongs to you.`
` I ask that you use it as you please, and hope that it will be enough to heal some small part of the pain you have suffered...`
` That trifling amount of gold may be nothing in comparison with the sin I committed,`
` .........but even so, it should be enough to bring you some comfort."`
`"Th‐.........thank...you........."`
`".........Lion.`
` .........I have one.........final request."`
`"Wh‐......what is that.........?"`
`"Could you..................`
`.........call me........."`
`"......Huh? ......Sorry, what did you say......?"`
`"Could you............call me.........Father?"`
`".............................."`
`"......I understand why you are not able to...`
` ......I have not been a father to you in any way.`
` Furthermore, you have been raised without knowing anything about your father.`
` ......I realize that it's not a name you can call me by.`
` And, I realize that I have no right to ask this of you.`
` .........But, knowing all of that, ......still, I ask you......`
` ......If I could just hear that, ......I would have no further regrets......"`
`.........After being asked like that, ......was it possible for me to refuse?`
`Even if I am his child, ......I cannot see him as my father...`
`So, I felt a strong resistance to saying that word.`
`But......I decided that saying it was the right thing to do.`
`Only God can truly forgive sins.`
`But, ......though it may be temporary,`
` people can be saved by the forgiveness of others.`
`".........F‐....................."`
`"........................"`
`"..................`
` .........Fath......er............"`
`"Heh, ............heheheh............"`
`That awkward word made Kinzo laugh.`
`{n}Drops of silver fell from both of his eyes.`
`At that moment, ......the shadow that had covered his face......was wiped away......`
`"Thank you, ......Lion.`
` My child......`
` .........And {f:5:Beatrice}, as well.`
` Thank you for this last chance......to ask for forgiveness........."`
`"......Of course, I don't believe that such a simple act will earn me forgiveness.`
` ......The rest, I will do as I burn in the fires of hell.`
` .........I, Ushiromiya Kinzo, have no more regrets in this life!!`
` None at all! No regrets or things left undone!!`
` Wahaha, ......waha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}hah!!`
` Waaah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!!"`
`Looking up to the heavens, Kinzo spread his arms as though facing an applauding audience,`
` ......laughing at the top of his lungs.`
`It was the final pleasure, known only by those who have been released from all regrets of this world.`
`.........Kinzo's laugh weakened, ......and when it disappeared...`
`He dropped to his knees...`
`...like a puppet with its strings cut...`
`............and slowly...`
`......fell to the ground.........`
`"......M‐.........my lord......"`
`"Doctor Nanjo......"`
`"Y‐......yes........."`
`Though their master had fallen, ......they walked up to him slowly.`
`They already knew.`
`{n}Kinzo's soul......had already burned itself out.`
`After checking Kinzo's pulse, Nanjo shook his head and stood back up.`
`"............It was a peaceful death.`
` ......I don't think he had any regrets at all."`
`"It may be......that the Master died long before now.`
` ......It was only his magic and tenacity that kept him here so long.`
` ......And.........once he finally had a chance to apologize to {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama for everything, .........he finished everything he had to do..."`
`".........Please, ......rest in peace.`
` ............I believe that you have redeemed yourself."`
`".................................Father........."`
`That was...`
`...the one‐night reunion...`
`...between me and my father...`
`...and also our final farewell......`
`".........This gold all belongs to you now.`
` ......If you wish to exchange it for money, I can arrange for that."`
`"I hear it's worth 20 billion yen.`
` .........All of your dreams in this world can now be granted with money."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho......`
` It must be tough to think of what to do with this much money when it suddenly comes your way."`
`"............There is nothing I desire among the things money can buy.`
` ......So, for the present, I would like to leave this here."`
`......Of course, I'm glad I have a lot of money.`
`However, money can't heal the pain in my heart.`
`{n}I just.........want him to come back.`
`"As you wish.`
` Then it shall be left here.`
` ......Also, take this key."`
`".........What is this?"`
`"It is the key to this underground VIP room.`
` If you use this, you won't need to use the more complicated device."`
`She was the only one who knew the answer to the epitaph's riddle, and the only key to this place was now hers.`
`......At this point, she truly was the master of this golden VIP room.`
`"You are already the master of Rokkenjima.`
` You have the right to know all of this island's secrets."`
`".........We should talk about Kuwadorian too."`
`"That's the mansion your mother lived in.`
` ......I'm sure you've heard rumors about it."`
`"Kuwadorian........."`
`"There are two mansions on this island, one at either end.`
` ......One is the mansion we know well.`
` The other is a hidden mansion known as Kuwadorian."`
`"Below this island are the remains of a military base built during the war.`
` The Master used that to travel between the two ends of the island..."`
`"There is an underground path in the back of this room, and if you follow it, you will reach the basement of Kuwadorian on the other end of this island.`
` ......That is a secret mansion, which only the Master knew of.`
` Of course, that mansion, like everything else, now belongs to the new head."`
`"......It's the mansion your mother lived in.`
` It's probably worth taking a trip over there sometime."`
`"My......mother............"`
`I've lived alone my whole life.`
`The only person I've ever felt like calling "Mother" is Kumasawa‐san, who always helped me out.`
`The mansion where a mother I've never met nor seen lived...`
`.........Who in the world.........am I......?`
`"Ask any questions you wish.`
` ......You now deserve to know everything."`
`"......Right now, ......I'm feeling very confused.`
` ......I don't even know where I should start asking questions.`
` ......But I'm sure......I'll think of plenty of things to ask about.`
` ......When I do, please tell me..."`
`"As you wish."`
`"A‐......also,`
` ......being treated so respectfully like that...`
`is a bit uncomfortable.`
` I'd be happier if you could talk to me the same way you've always done."`
`"If that is what you wish, then I will do so."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` That's easier for me too."`
`".........Well now.`
` What will we do now, Genji‐san?`
` ......Kinzo‐san is dead."`
`"I will tell Krauss‐sama and Madam that he has passed away.`
` ......Then, we must tell them that Lion‐sama is the official successor to the headship.`
` After all, from this point forth, you are the Ushiromiya family head."`
`"M‐me as the head? That's......`
` And isn't Krauss‐sama the successor......?"`
`"The one who solves the epitaph's riddle is the successor.`
` .........There exists a will specifying this.`
` .........The Master's final order was that you were to inherit everything."`
`"P‐please wait...!`
` I appreciate the sentiment, ......but I can't do the job of being the successor,`
` ......and I can't accept such a big responsibility.`
` I think it would be better for Krauss‐sama to inherit that role......"`
`".........Are you certain?"`
`"Today, ......I have learned who I am.`
` ......Everyone knows about their parents,`
` but I didn't, since the time of my birth.`
` ......And here, today, I finally learned the truth.`
` ......That alone is enough for me."`
`If I suddenly became the Ushiromiya family head, how would Krauss‐sama react?`
` How angry would Madam be?`
`I don't want to become the head if it means making them feel like that.`
`Today, I learned who I am.`
`Who gave birth to me, how, and when?`
` ......These are things I want to learn from them as time goes by.`
`That alone is enough.`
`".........I am Lion.`
` ......And I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Knowing that is enough for me.`
` ......I don't plan on calling myself the head.`
` ......Krauss‐sama can take that job."`
`"Is that your order, as the Ushiromiya family head?"`
`".........Yes."`
`".....................`
` ......As you wish, Master.`
` Then I will make it so."`
`"And please, don't tell anyone about what happened tonight.`
` .........I want to stay me.`
` ......There's nothing I'd want to do if I had the Ushiromiya headship or the gold."`
`......I just...`
`"I want to wait.........here on this island......as I have done in the past.`
` I want everything to be exactly the same as it was.`
` .........That's my only wish."`
`"...........................`
` As you wish, Master.`
` ......Everything that has happened tonight will not go beyond those present here.`
` ......Kumasawa.`
` Doctor Nanjo.`
` That is the wish of the new head."`
`"......If that's what you want, I have no objections.`
` Kinzo‐san's will entrusts everything to you.`
` If this is what you want to do, none of us will complain."`
`"You say "exactly the same as it was",`
` ......but do you really mean exactly the same...?`
` With no differences at all...?"`
`"Yes.`
` .........We'll keep this a secret.`
` ......This place and the gold will be sealed away.`
` If I need money, I'll ask you about it then.`
` .........That's enough for me."`
`"As you wish.`
` The mechanism leading to this place and the key both belong to you.`
` ......And all of us swear to keep the events of this night a secret.`
` .........Krauss‐sama will be the successor,`
` ......but in my heart, you will be the only true successor."`
`"......As you have ordered, we will behave the same way we always have, but please order us whenever it suits you.`
` You are my only master."`
`"..................Th‐.........thank you very much..."`
`A vast mountain of gold and the ring of the Ushiromiya family head.`
`{n}The dress of the portrait {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`And.........I became the true {f:5:Beatrice}, the Golden Witch.`
`Right here in my very own Golden Land.`
`If I think about it, not much has actually changed.`
`After all, I've always been the Golden Witch. ......I've just had a few more people acknowledge that.`
`{a:c:November 29th.`
`{n}The day I became a true witch.}`
`{a:c:`
`Oh, I am one yet many.`
`I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.}`
`{a:c:`
`The true ruler of Rokkenjima,{n}......and the possessor of endless gold.}`
`{a:c:`
`Yet, I am in no way complete.}`
`{a:c:`
`......Here I wait...{n}for the return of the one person I love......}`
