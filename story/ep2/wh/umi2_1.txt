`My mind wandered. `
`Back to the days when I could barely imagine the happiness I have now. `
`I was a middle schooler at the time. `
`A normal girl who thought about love as much as you'd expect of someone at that age. `
`But in truth, it was wrong of me to have that dream. `
`...After all, I am furniture. `
`Furniture is nothing more than a tool, not a human. `
`As a person less than human, simply receiving an education was an enormous blessing. `
`So in reality, even thinking about falling in love was more than I deserved... `
`The Ushiromiya family conference was a customary event held every October, `
`but relatives sometimes visited at other times. `
`...Of course, they didn't come just to drink tea. `
`On this day, Eva's family was visiting the Head Family on Rokkenjima. `
`The three members of Krauss's family and the three members of Eva's family had gathered in the parlor `
`and were having a friendly chat about recent events. `
`Genji had supposedly told Kinzo of Eva's family's arrival, but he still hadn't come down. `
`...He was probably immersed in his 'research' and couldn't spare the time. `
`This often happened, so the others waited patiently for their fickle father to arrive. `
`"Hoh. `
`How promising. `
`Make sure you work hard under your father, building the skills you'll need if you want to lend him a hand soon." `
`"Thank you very much. `
`I've learned countless precious things from the many experienced people Father has introduced me to. `
`And these were all things I could never have learned in school." `
`"When you're in school, it's not math and language you're learnin'. `
`What they're really teachin' you is the right outlook and attitude for learnin' more. `
`Once you've got that base, you can finally start a long period of study that'll last your entire life." `
`"People who don't get this end up spendin' their whole lives as fools who never learn. `
`Just gettin' full marks in math and language won't do you any good at your company!" `
`"Indeed, that is exactly right. `
`Hideyoshi-san, your style of education never fails to impress." `
`"George isn't quite a full man yet! `
`He'd better always keep that in mind and embrace his studies." `
`"Stop it, dear. `
`George is always giving it his all. `
`Right?" `
`"Truly admirable. `
`I wish our Jessica would learn from him..." `
`"...Sheesh. `
`Are you still holding a grudge about that test score? `
`I'm studying for tests the best I can. `
`At least don't say it here. `
`Pissing me off." `
`Once people started praising George for his diligence, the conversation usually turned to Jessica, who hated studying. `
`Jessica made an openly displeased face, as though she'd known this would happen. `
`"My, my... `
`Schoolwork aside, it seems Jessica had better learn to choose her words a little more gracefully. `
`How improper for the single daughter who bears the weight of the Ushiromiya family crest." `
`"Come now, she's quite appealing in her own way, isn't she? `
`Times change. `
`The time when we had to act all modest to entertain men ended long ago." `
`"That's right, that's right! `
`I knew you'd understand, Aunt Eva! `
`Eheheheh!" `
`"......Haah... `
`My headache is truly trying today." `
`"Are you okay? `
`Aunt Natsuhi, you're looking a bit pale." `
`"Thank you, I am fine. `
`...Still, time really has flown. `
`It feels like just yesterday when you would run around half-naked by the beach and come back soaked." `
`"Wasn't your Jessica-chan the same? `
`And now she's a lady who fusses over how to put on makeup. `
`I see you've focused on your eyebrows. You look really cute today." `
`"Thank you very much. `
`No one noticed, so I was a bit unsure of myself." `
`A full smile rose to Jessica's face as the results of her own 'studies' were finally appreciated. `
`Eva smiled back in the same way. `
`...Then, she turned that smile towards Natsuhi. `
`"Come on, Natsuhi nee-san. `
`You must take notice of small changes in your own child. `
`Poor Jessica-chan. `
`You probably wanted your mother to notice first, didn't you?" `
`"No problem, no problem. `
`That person never notices anything." `
`"Jessica, `
`I cannot condone you speaking of your mother in such a fashion. `
`Apologize." `
`"...Later, I will speak to you at length about your language." `
`"Tch... `
`If you don't want kids getting in your way, just say so. `
`I'm gonna take a step outside. `
`It's getting stuffy in here." `
`"Jessica...!" `
`Jessica was still at the age where tests and entrance exams are pretty nerve-racking. `
`Recently, she'd clashed often with her mother, who was enthusiastic about her education. `
`"Excuse me... `
`Kya?!" `
`Jessica, who was trying to leave the parlor in a bad mood, bumped into Shannon, who was pushing a serving cart filled with tea. `
`"Ah, Shannon. No need to worry about my tea. `
`I'm just gonna go wander around the garden." `
`"...M-Milady..." `
`"Shannon, the tea is getting cold. `
`Serve it quickly." `
`"M-My apologies..." `
`Shannon hadn't actually done anything wrong, `
`but Natsuhi, who felt like something shameful to herself had been shown, lashed out at her emotionally. `
`...This was something that often happened in the Ushiromiya family. `
`But it seemed Shannon wasn't strong-willed enough to just accept it and move on. `
`She shrank back and cowered while serving the tea. `
`She had the unfortunate habit of making more mistakes when she cowered. `
`Her pitiful appearance ruined the peaceful atmosphere that had existed a moment before. `
`It wasn't really Shannon's fault, but she thought she might be the source and felt a pressure on her chest. `
`Her shaking fingers made the utensils clang, and you couldn't have called it graceful, not even just to be polite. `
`The more pitiful she appeared, the greater the silence grew, `
`the more irritated Natsuhi looked, and the more Shannon cowered... `
`Shannon's thin neck felt like it was being suffocated and choked by the reaper known as stress. `
`At that time, George spoke brightly, blowing away the stiff atmosphere. `
`"This smells nice. `
`What kind of black tea is it?" `
`"Umm, `
`......this is..." `
`"No, don't say it. `
`I'll guess. `
`It's a very distinctive smell, so I probably know it. `
`...Is it Earl Grey?" `
`"I-I think it probably is..." `
`"Ahahahaha. `
`Yeah, I'll bet it's Earl Grey. `
`When you get back to the kitchen, check the tin." `
`"Hoh. `
`George-kun, you know a lot about black tea, don't you?" `
`"One of the company presidents who's looked after me was very knowledgeable about black tea. `
`I managed to pick up a little while listening to him discuss the subject." `
`"Oh yeah, the president of Okonogi Foods. `
`Yep, that sort of trivia is that guy's specialty!" `
`"The names of black teas often refer to the places they're made, right? `
`So, did this come from a place with that name?" `
`"From what I've heard, there was a person called Earl Grey in England long ago, and it was named after him. `
`Furthermore, this distinctive smell doesn't come from tea leaves, but from a fruit called a bergamot, which is a relative of the mandarin orange." `
`"Is that so? `
`I never knew that. `
`Learning things like that makes tea taste all the more delicious." `
`"Same thing goes for alcohol and cigarettes. `
`Luxury items have a taste of romance. `
`Knowin' stuff like this deepens the taste." `
`"It's the same as reading the list of benefits on a medicine bottle. `
`Natsuhi nee-san, you should try reading the explanation on your favorite headache medicine someday. `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*." `
`"Hahahaha! `
`That's a wonderful idea. `
`Try it tonight." `
`"...Yes, I'll do so." `
`"Shannon-chan, try opening that pot. `
`You should find some dried bergamot mixed in with the tea leaves." `
`"Ah, ...yes. `
`It's in there. `
`Something like dried orange peel is mixed in." `
`"Yes. `
`That's probably bergamot. `
`The main ingredient in Earl Grey's scent. `
`The scent is vivid, so you might expect the taste to be intense, but it's still gentle and easy to drink. `
`If you make it with milk, the scent should become more mild, which works great. `
`If there's anything left in the pot after you've poured for everyone, you really should try drinking it with milk." `
`"Ah, ...yes... `
`Thank you very much..." `
`George gave her a small wink. `
`Shannon finally realized that George had kindheartedly swept aside the tense atmosphere in the room. `
`And he had done it for the sake of Shannon herself, a cowering servant. `
`The Ushiromiya family did not pamper their servants. `
`Any display of awkwardness would be harshly punished. `
`So it was rare for them to be given a helping hand like this. `
`Thanks to George's kindness, Shannon managed to regain control of herself and finished serving tea without further incident. `
`As long as she stayed calm, she could carry out her work elegantly and flawlessly. `
`By the time the black tea was laid out on the table and its elegant scent filled the room, `
`the atmosphere had completely returned to its former peaceful mood, and everyone praised George's knowledge. `
`Shannon wanted to thank him for saving her, but it didn't look like she would get the chance. `
`So she decided to at least thank him inside her heart, praying to God that George would hear it as she pushed the serving cart away. `
`"George nii-san always lends a helping hand at times like that. `
`By changing the topic or something." `
`Shannon and Jessica were in the rose garden. `
`Jessica still hadn't returned to the parlor after getting into a fight with her mother and was nonchalantly killing time here. `
`"...When I think back on it, I get the feeling this wasn't the first time he's helped me like that." `
`Whenever I made a careless mistake and George was around, `
`I'm pretty sure he'd always naturally smooth things over and restore harmony. `
`...Maybe it wasn't something as direct as picking up a fork that had been dropped. `
`But that was his way of caring. `
`Even servants have their pride. `
`They want to fix their own mistakes by themselves. `
`...And if a guest lends them a hand, they'll lose face. `
`"He's really good at reading between the lines when stuff like that happens. `
`Well, I guess it's kind of like an art to him. `
`That guy's more of a show-off than he looks. `
`Ahahahahaha." `
`"Th-That's not true... `
`...I think he's a really wonderful person." `
`"Hmmmm...?! `
`...Shannon, you haven't fallen in love with George nii-san, have you?" `
`For once, Shannon had disagreed with Jessica in a slightly forceful tone, which immediately caught Jessica's attention. `
`"No, ...that's not it, I think......" `
`"Come to think of it, I've hardly heard any stories about George nii-san and love. `
`Hmm? `
`I think I remember hearing him say that family-oriented girls were his type, didn't I? `
`Sweet, that fits you perfectly, Shannon!" `
`"I-I-It does...?! `
`I don't... `
`...I am not, uh, `
`...suitable for such a thing..." `
`"Not suitable? Like hell you aren't! `
`You've known him so long, you're practically a childhood friend. `
`They say that when you start from a natural relationship where you don't think of the other as a member of the opposite sex, things start to move pretty fast once you finally start thinking about it. `
`There's no doubt!" `
`Jessica loved teen magazines with this kind of story, and she was always getting excited talking about that kind of thing with her friends. `
`She was very quick to pick up on love stories like this. `
`So this wasn't the first time Shannon had been exposed to this kind of story. `
`But this certainly was the first time she'd started thinking of George as a member of the opposite sex. `
`She was furniture, while George was an honored guest and a member of the Ushiromiya family. `
`...Until now, she'd assumed that even imagining any deeper relationship with him would be impermissible. `
`So she hadn't thought of it. `
`Since it was someone else's problem, Jessica poked fun at it, seeming to enjoy herself. `
`It was all Shannon could do to hide her blushing cheeks. `
`If George were to appear at a time like that, she'd have no chance of keeping her cool. `
`They saw George come out from the entrance hall of the mansion. `
`It looked like he'd seen them as well. `
`He headed over, waving his hand. `
`Shannon had to frantically try and regain her ordinary composure before George reached them... `
`"Grandfather finally came down. `
`Now they're having an adult discussion, so they chased me out." `
`"Hahaha, escaping then was the right choice. `
`It'd be better to kiss the angel of death than look at Grandfather's face." `
`"You shouldn't speak that way. `
`...But you know, I think Grandfather might think of us as angels of death. `
`After all, we came here to talk about borrowing money for business reasons." `
`That's right, this wasn't the customary annual October family conference. `
`Eva's family had visited to apply for a business loan from the Head Family. `
`Kinzo had vast resources, and he lent those out to his children. `
`Of course, they didn't borrow money because they were living in poverty. `
`...How would they expand their businesses with the vast sums they wanted to borrow? `
`How much interest would be attached, and how long would they have to repay it? `
`This wasn't the sort of loan designed for the poor. `
`It was a loan for those who were on the offensive. `
`Kinzo strictly judged whether it would be worth lending out his fortune, and afterwards, he strictly oversaw its use. `
`So Rokkenjima would sometimes play host to this spectacle, where relatives visited and described their businesses to Kinzo. `
`To the parents, these meetings burdened them with the strain of having to move a vast amount of money. `
`But to Jessica, who lived on this isolated island called Rokkenjima, it was a precious opportunity to meet up with her cousins. `
`So being able to talk with the occasional guest such as George like this... `
`immediately cured the bad mood she'd gotten from that fight with her mother. `
`"My family's totally stingy too. `
`They've probably got money to spare, so why not lend it out graciously? `
`Dad and Grandfather'll probably get pigheaded and act all important." `
`"It's natural to be prudent when lending money. `
`Of course, my father will use what he borrows to expand his business, and he came with a plan that promises a solid probability of repayment. `
`Everything else is left up to the presentation. `
`...But I really wish I could watch from the corner and learn. `
`Mother chased me out. `
`I'm a little let down." `
`"...It seems the Master still tends to scold Krauss-sama and Eva-sama as if they were kids. `
`I'm sure she didn't want to let her son see that." `
`As Shannon hung her head, she thought back on a scene familiar to those who worked in the mansion. `
`Even Krauss, who acted haughtily towards his siblings, was still treated like a child by Kinzo. `
`...Shannon herself had often seen Kinzo slap Krauss and tell him to sit up straight. `
`......It was probably very embarrassing to be coerced like that at his age. `
`Taking care to avoid being present at times like that...was one of the important responsibilities held by the servants working here. `
`...However, the fact that Shannon had ended up witnessing such a scene...meant that she'd messed up at least once in the past. `
`"Yes, I imagine so. `
`...Maybe figuring that out and staying away is part of a child's duty. `
`......Aaah! `
`That aside, the flowers in this garden are truly splendid this year." `
`George stretched as he said that. `
`...And he smoothly changed the subject away from one that was a little gloomy. `
`This time, Shannon noticed it too. `
`......This person, George, could sensitively figure out the situation, and always changed the subject to something harmonious out of kindness. `
`It was so smooth that Shannon hadn't noticed it until today. `
`Today, Shannon really had to admire the way George did that. `
`Of the boys close to Shannon's age that she'd known, nearly all had been classmates during her period of mandatory education. `
`But they had all been young...and none had possessed the composure George had. `
`Mere moments ago, he'd been just another guest, `
`...but right now, she couldn't help but think of him as something more. `
`However, such thoughts were mere distractions from her work as a servant. `
`Shannon tried to chase them away with a small shake of her head. `
`"Hmm? `
`What's up?" `
`"Ah, no, it's nothing...! `
`Umm, shall I make some tea? `
`Uh, ......I will prepare some more of that Earl Grey." `
`"Ahaha, so you've remembered the name of that tea. `
`I'm glad." `
`"Um, .........umm........." `
`"Hmm?" `
`"...Umm, ......thank you for your concern back then..." `
`Shannon was finally able to put her gratitude into words. `
`If you wrote it out, it wouldn't be very long, `
`...but Shannon had needed a little spark of courage to say it out loud. `
`But George played dumb. `
`"What do you mean? `
`I don't remember doing anything I should be thanked for. `
`Heheh." `
`He seemed to be playing the gentleman in his own way, letting her know he wasn't doing it out of a desire for gratitude. `
`George's response seemed to be more or less exactly what Jessica had predicted. `
`She couldn't help but burst out laughing. `
`"See? `
`Isn't he a bit of a show-off at times like this?" `
`"N-No... `
`That's not......" `
`Jessica poked fun at Shannon as the latter remained silent, red-faced. `
`George didn't know the details, but he naturally joined in, laughing the same way. `
`The three of them lazily walked around the garden, catching up on recent events. `
`George, as the oldest cousin, talked about his life experiences. `
`Jessica talked about recent life on Rokkenjima. `
`And Shannon talked about her recent work. `
`They kept going on about these trivial things. `
`Even when Shannon heard the others talk about deeply interesting things, `
`she never felt any particular interest in the actual content of their stories. `
`She was nothing more than a servant, and she had no intention of delving into her masters' lives. `
`She simply wanted them to enjoy their time speaking with her... `
`and would only pretend to listen intently and nod at the right moments. `
`But for some reason, the things George talked about today seemed to catch her interest powerfully. `
`Even things she'd normally ignore felt like they contained a trace of kindness behind the words. `
`For some reason, she wanted to know more things about George, no matter how trivial. `
`So, ...she stared fixedly at him. `
`She thought that as far as looks went, this Ushiromiya George... `
`was probably about average and didn't stick out in any particular way. `
`But he was diligent, serious, ...and had a deep prudence which allowed him to understand people's hearts and show concern. `
`But she'd never noticed these things before now. `
`She may not have met him many times, but she'd known his face for many years. `
`Even so, she hadn't noticed once until now. `
`...Shannon, embarrassed by her own obliviousness, blushed. `
`George, perhaps thinking that Shannon would listen intently to his stories, kept talking happily and at length about things he'd done and seen. `
`...But Jessica didn't miss that slight change in Shannon. `
`So, she decided she'd change the conversation to the topic she was sure Shannon was most interested in. `
`"...Oh yeah, come to think of it, `
`George nii-san, have you finally gotten a girlfriend, or what?" `
`"Wh-Where did that come from...?" `
`Normally, that reaction should've been answer enough. `
`But for some reason, as she was now, Shannon wouldn't be able to understand it unless he said it clearly. `
`"U-Umm... `
`George-sama is very nice, `
`......so I'm sure... `
`...umm, ...he's very popular..." `
`"Well, err, ...hahahahahahahahahaha." `
`"Quit it Shannon. `
`Isn't cornering him like that actually pretty mean? `
`Heheheh!" `
`"I-I wasn't trying to be mean........." `
`"Well, I'm flattered that you have that mistaken impression of me, `
`but unfortunately, I still haven't had a relationship with any particular girl. `
`After all, my looks are below average, as you can see. `
`And I can't speak tactfully in a way that can entertain a girl." `
`"I-I don't think that's true. `
`...And, I think a man's charm is decided by something that can't be measured by his appearance. `
`Th-That's why, umm, `
`...I think you might be considered a...um...a very attractive man, George-sama..." `
`Shannon was being uncharacteristically verbose. `
`She hardly ever spoke at such length. `
`George seemed fairly pleased to hear someone applaud his charm like this, but he was just a little surprised at this sudden high praise. `
`Jessica, now sure her guess was spot on, appeared to be barely holding back laughter. `
`"Thank you, Shannon-chan. `
`I hope I do bump into a girl who's generous enough to feel attracted to me before too long." `
`"Yes, I'm sure you'll run into one. `
`......I'm sure there's at least one... `
`...no, a l-lot of girls who will recognize your real charm." `
`She probably wanted to say that there was at least one girl very close to him. `
`...Shannon avoided saying that much, drawing a final line as a servant. `
`"...R-Really? `
`...I guess I'm kind of...embarrassed..." `
`He had probably never been praised this heavily by a girl before. `
`George's face turned just as bright red as Shannon's. `
`As she watched the two of them, Jessica giggled sadistically. `
`"Well, I'm sure you'll eventually bump into a wonderful partner, George nii-san, `
`but I doubt you'll be able to properly escort your partner as you are now, right? `
`It looks like you're diligent, but you've completely abandoned your study of 'that'." `
`"...S-Sorry about that. `
`I'll start studying that bit by bit." `
`"And how do you plan to do that all by yourself? `
`Are you gonna watch romance movies or something? `
`Or are you gonna learn from Uncle Hideyoshi? `
`Heheheheh!" `
`"Tch... `
`Well, you're acting pretty triumphant. `
`Men are no match for girls when it comes to this sort of thing." `
`Normally, when George and Jessica got together, their parents would say 'George is diligent and admirable', and 'Jessica is lazy and rude'. `
`So it was probably unbearable fun for Jessica to have their roles finally reversed. `
`George realized this as well, so he resigned himself to being the one getting teased for once. `
`"So, George nii-san, as long as you're okay with it, why not practice a bit with Shannon? `
`It'll be your job to keep Shannon entertained all day long on a date! `
`What do you think?!" `
`"Wh-Wh-What are you...?! `
`M-Milady...!" `
`When she heard Jessica's audacious plan, Shannon's face turned bright red with a 'poof', and a doughnut of smoke started to rise from her head. `
`"Th-That's a very tempting plan, ...but I wouldn't want to burden Shannon-chan. `
`It'd just end up wasting one of her precious days off, wouldn't it? `
`I'd be butting in on that sacred time that she should be spending alone with someone she really likes. `
`I couldn't do something so boorish." `
`"I-I-I also, umm, `
`......don't have a person I have feelings for or anything, so, umm, `
`...there's no...no, yes, there's no need to hold back for my sake...!" `
`Shannon's blood had all rushed to her head, and it looked like even she didn't know what she was babbling about. `
`Jessica, who knew how Shannon normally was, seemed to be finding this hilarious. `
`She couldn't hide her cackling laughter anymore. `
`"...I-Is that true...? `
`I can't believe a cute girl like you would be single, Shannon-chan..." `
`"I, I, I, `
`am a servant, so, umm, `
`......of course I don't have any relationships with boys, umm..." `
`"Which means that, if Shannon ever wants a chance at getting herself a wonderful guy, `
`she needs practice with relationships too, right? `
`So you both want the same thing. `
`Sweet, that'll be perfect, heheh!" `
`Jessica irresponsibly cheered the two of them on. `
`By now, even George was hanging his head and turning red. `
`"George, I've been calling to you for a while now. `
`Didn't you hear me?" `
`When Eva appeared in what was already an embarrassing situation, both of them got even more flustered. `
`Jessica watched and laughed loudly. `
`"Ah, M-M-Mother...! `
`Sorry, I was so engrossed in our conversation. `
`I didn't notice...!" `
`"Oh, Eva-sama, ...you have my deepest apologies..." `
`"It looks like you young kids are getting really fired up together. `
`You're all about that age. `
`Oh, I know how kids your age can talk about that sort of thing forever. `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*." `
`"Ah, come on, you're still young yourself, Aunt Eva. `
`Please tell us how you and Uncle Hideyoshi met." `
`"Oh my, there's no way I could say that. `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle* `
`You all really are so young. `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*." `
`"S-So, what is it, Mother? `
`You called because you wanted something, right?" `
`"Your father and the rest have finished talking. `
`We're going to talk to Grandfather about you, so come on." `
`"About me? `
`What could that be?" `
`"The same thing you were all talking about just now. `
`You know what I mean, right?" `
`"O-Oh, that. `
`That isn't really something we need to talk to Grandfather about, right...?" `
`"What's going on? `
`Wait, George nii-san, are you getting married?!" `
`"C-Congratulations...!" `
`"No, no...! `
`Didn't I just say I didn't have a particular woman I was interested in?" `
`"That isn't something to brag about, is it? `
`...Good grief." `
`Eva smiled bitterly, looking a little exasperated. `
`"...Oh, ...I get it! `
`George nii-san, it's one of those, right? An 'omiai', a marriage meeting!" `
`"A marriage meeting, ...you say?" `
`"......Nng, ......well, yeah. `
`......Hahahaha..." `
`Surely, as a man, George wanted to find a partner by himself and bring her home with him. `
`So it seemed he thought it a bit pathetic to meet his partner for the first time in a marriage meeting arranged by his parents. `
`"Shouldn't marriage meetings be done at a more mature age...?! `
`I still don't feel like I've become a full-fledged adult..." `
`"Of course, we have no desire to rush into an immediate engagement or marriage, right? `
`There's nothing wrong with deepening your friendship first, and then having her moved to our family register after you've gotten older and settled down." `
`Judging by Eva's forceful attitude and George's noncommittal one, the others could catch a glimpse of the story behind this marriage meeting. `
`They didn't know who George was supposed to be meeting, but it was surely someone who would profit Eva's family in a business sense. `
`The very fact that they'd be satisfied with a mere engagement to deepen the relationship between the two families, rather than an immediate marriage, made it feel almost like a political maneuver. `
`"You see, marriage isn't something you should enter into only after you start liking someone. `
`You marry first, and then you adjust. `
`If you marry based purely on emotions, you'll always end up regretting it. `
`There's certainly nothing wrong with choosing a person with a secure background for your partner in life, and then developing your affection later." `
`"Aunt Eva, isn't that kinda rude to Uncle Hideyoshi? `
`Heheh!" `
`"I love that man. `
`I want to always be with him, and to live my life by his side." `
`"......Eva-sama, that's wonderful. `
`Truly splendid..." `
`"Thank you. `
`But we built up those feelings while we were husband and wife, you see? `
`And I believe that in the future, we will be much, much closer than we are now. `
`I think that's what's best for a married couple." `
`"Still, I don't think you can use that to argue that it's okay to marry someone you don't even like." `
`"But it also doesn't mean that it's okay to marry anyone, as long as you like them. `
`It only takes an instant to get married, `
`but your life as a married couple will last a long, long time after that. `
`So you should search with prudence and avoid making decisions based on momentary emotions. `
`Don't you think a matter like this would be better handled by us, rather than a person lacking in life experience such as yourself?" `
`"...Th-That may be true, but..." `
`"I'm proud of you, my only son. `
`You've grown magnificently, and I'm sure you'll do us proud no matter where you go. `
`...And now that Battler-kun has left the family register, you are Father's only male grandchild carrying his blood. `
`......We must prudently choose a fitting partner for you." `
`As everyone related to the Ushiromiya family knew, Eva adored George immensely. `
`But that didn't mean she had pampered him. `
`She had been strict with him and had raised him into a wonderful boy who wouldn't betray her expectations. `
`...That was why she treasured him so. `
`"Your partner certainly won't be selected based on your parents' profit and loss. `
`...I'll bring you a suitable and truly wonderful woman. `
`At this moment, your immaturity might make this seem unpleasant to you. `
`......But if you're going to take my advice on anything, listen to me now. `
`Have I ever failed to act in your best interest?" `
`"..................No, ......you haven't..." `
`"That's enough for now. `
`So, let's go. `
`We're keeping Father waiting. `
`Hurry to the mansion." `
`"Well, sorry, you two. `
`See you later." `
`George bowed to the two of them, ...and after bowing once more to Shannon, he dashed off to the mansion. `
`"I'll be going with him. `
`Forgive me for interrupting such an entertaining conversation, Jessica-chan, Shannon-chan." `
`"N-No, no. `
`Please, don't worry about it. `
`Come on, Shannon. `
`Let's go." `
`"Y-Yes...!" `
`"It's okay. `
`I'm sure you'll meet someone wonderful soon too, Jessica-chan. `
`A wonderful person suitable for you." `
`"So, if he's at the same level as me, hahaha, you mean a guy with shit grades? `
`That kinda pisses me off, hahaha!" `
`"And of course, you too, Shannon-chan. `
`I'm sure that a wonderful man suitable for you will appear." `
`"Y-Yes!! `
`Thank you very much..." `
`As Eva giggled and smiled, she approached Shannon's ear with a hand over her mouth, as though she was trying to tell her a secret. `
`"......Huh?" `
`"I'm sure you'll find a perfect match for a lowly servant like yourself. `
`......Have you forgotten to be grateful for your education? `
`Know your place." `
`"......Th-That's not what......I meant..." `
`"George is the eldest grandson carrying Father's blood. `
`He's a person who may bear the burden of the Ushiromiya family someday in the future. `
`To answer to that expectation, he has studied tirelessly, entered a wonderful college, and is getting wonderful grades. `
`Did you really think you could snatch George away, you uneducated, incompetent, unqualified, uncultured servaaaant?" `
`Those malicious words all poured into Shannon's ear without spilling a drop... `
`......To Shannon, it was like cold water was being poured in there. `
`"............I-I... `
`...didn't mean..." `
`This was all whispered to Shannon in secret. `
`And with the same smile as before. `
`...Jessica, who could only see Eva's expression, didn't think it was anything other than Eva telling Shannon some embarrassing story about love. `
`When their secret conversation ended, Eva patted Shannon's shoulders, as though she was urging her on. `
`"Don't worry, `
`I'm sure you'll find a 'perfect' match for a partner. `
`Right? `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle* `
`...Okay, Jessica-chan. `
`See you later." `
`"Yeah, see you later. `
`And make sure you tell me about you and Uncle Hideyoshi next time!!" `
`"No waaay. `
`Ahahahahahahahahaha...!" `
`Eva laughed loudly and headed back to the entrance hall. `
`Behind Jessica, who was cheerfully waving her hand, `
`...Shannon reflected very, very deeply on those words of Eva's about knowing her place... `
`...It's time for me to take a serious look...at how full of myself I've been acting. `
`I forgot. `
`I'm furniture. `
`Furniture isn't human. `
`So, I am a being who must feel gratitude for even being treated like a human, `
`and I am not permitted to wish for anything more. `
`People sometimes develop affection for furniture they're used to using, `
`but that is an emotion on the human's side, and the furniture has no right to hope for such a thing. `
`...It's enough that furniture serves with simple honesty day after day. `
`That feeling I got when talking to George-sama and Jessica-sama...is the same as a forbidden drug to me. `
`In other words, it may be an emotion I must never experience. `
`"...Shannon, `
`you've had your head in the clouds for some time now. `
`Do you not feel well?" `
`"N-No. `
`My apologies..." `
`Natsuhi's words were right on the mark. `
`Even Shannon couldn't believe that she hadn't noticed Natsuhi until she had called. `
`Normally, it was essential that she focus on her cleaning at this time of day. `
`But she'd spent all her time sighing and hardly making any progress... `
`"Even when there aren't any guests around, you must always be alert. `
`Behavior like this is shameful for an Ushiromiya Family servant." `
`"...Yes Ma'am. `
`I will take care...from now on..." `
`"The Head and my husband will return very soon. `
`Have you finished cleaning the study? `
`Have you finished cleaning the staircase?" `
`"M-My apologies... `
`Not yet..." `
`"Yes, I know. `
`So I had Lunon do it. `
`While you were plodding around, cleaning the hallway, she finished cleaning the study and the staircase." `
`"...That's because, umm, `
`...I wanted to clean it properly, so it took some time..." `
`Shannon was simple and honest, so she would always carry out her tasks seriously and properly, without any omissions. `
`So, she was always slow with her work. `
`In contrast, Lunon cleverly avoided doing extra work whenever it was possible. `
`So, she could complete her jobs with a result that looked almost the same to an outsider, but in a much shorter time. `
`In other words, she was a shrewd employee. `
`Compared to that, it's probably fair to say that Shannon wasn't very shrewd at all, talking back to Natsuhi when Natsuhi was in a bad mood... `
`Of course, there was nothing that Natsuhi couldn't stand more than a servant talking back. `
`Her forehead creased, and she spoke sternly. `
`And yet, her slow, admonishing style of speech was even more terrifying, and finally made Shannon realize she had said the wrong thing... `
`"Then perhaps you should aim to do a truly thorough cleaning. `
`Shannon, I order you to clean the reception hall right now. `
`It is an important hall, where several pictures treasured by the Head are displayed, and where honored guests of the Ushiromiya family are welcomed. `
`Clean it thoroughly, so that not a speck of dust remains, and so that even you are satisfied. `
`Of course, you will finish before the day is out. `
`Until you finish that and report to me, you will not be permitted any food or rest. `
`Understood?" `
`"......Y-Yes, Madam." `
`"That is good. `
`Servants should endeavor to only use those words. `
`The next time you talk back, your punishment will be even more severe, so with that in mind, `
`engrave these words into your heart." `
`"Yes, ...Madam. `
`...Thank you for your guidance." `
`"You are welcome." `
`Behaving as though her headache was troubling her, Natsuhi headed off down the corridor... `
`When she couldn't see her anymore, Shannon hung her head and sighed. `
`...This was what happened when she had her head in the clouds. `
`Even though I'm bad at everything I do, I should be able to at least carry out the cleaning as well as an average person can, right? `
`It's because I can't even perform that very well...that I'm crying so pathetically. `
`But what's even more shameful... `
`Is that, not only have I been unable to perform a single bit of cleaning well, `
`but just now, when Natsuhi was scolding me, `
`...I imagined that person appearing and rescuing me. `
`If only George-sama were here. `
`Would he casually step in and save me? `
`Surely he'd show up cheerfully, intentionally acting like he didn't know what was going on, nimbly change the subject, and make me forget I'd ever been rebuked by Natsuhi... `
`I kept envisioning him... `
`suddenly appearing from the other side of the door, `
`or the other end of the hallway. `
`I envisioned the kind of person that would be an appropriate partner for him in a marriage meeting. `
`And I envisioned how unfitting I was for him. `
`Eva clearly told me. `
`It's been repeating over and over in my dreams... `
`"......You're still as clumsy as always, Nee-san. `
`Milady has been in a bad mood since this morning. `
`That just now happened because you talked too much, when you should've just hung your head in silence." `
`"...Kanon-kun..." `
`Kanon was suddenly there. `
`...His footsteps were always quieter than a cat's, and he never left any trace of his presence. `
`He probably could've stood there forever, and she still wouldn't have noticed him... `
`The expression on Kanon's face was...one of hatred. `
`He made that expression for Shannon, who didn't know how to do it herself... `
`"Madam and Lunon can fall into hell. `
`That person knows where Madam checks and only cleans those areas. `
`Her cleaning just now was like that. `
`I know because I saw. `
`......She wasn't really cleaning. `
`...She's just the worst kind of parasite, leeching off your thorough cleaning." `
`"You mustn't use such dirty words... `
`Dirty words pollute your clean soul, Kanon-kun. `
`So at least don't use those words in front of me. `
`...Okay?" `
`"......Hmph." `
`Kanon turned away as though sulking. `
`It was a reaction that hid his true feelings, which was very like Kanon, ...but I was a little happy. `
`He was getting mad for my sake. `
`"...Cleaning the reception hall will be tough. `
`I'll help." `
`"Thank you. `
`But I was the one Madam ordered, so don't worry. `
`...Don't you also have your own work, Kanon-kun?" `
`"......It's a filthy job. `
`My soul was polluted long ago." `
`Kanon then hung his head and bit his lower lip... `
`"Just hearing you say you'll help is enough for me. `
`...If you don't go back to your own job, then you'll be punished as well. `
`...And that would make me sad." `
`Shannon knew Kanon's character well. `
`...Sometimes, he didn't think enough about himself. `
`If I don't refuse forcefully, he'll help me even if it means neglecting his own job... `
`Kanon was a little sad that his goodwill had been rejected, `
`but he realized that what he was doing would only hurt her more in the end, and he gave a single, small sigh. `
`"......... `
`...Understood. `
`...Do your best, Nee-san." `
`"Yes. `
`......And I am also partly to blame." `
`"You aren't at fault at all, Nee-san...!" `
`"...No. `
`I am. `
`...So go now." `
`Kanon-kun's face showed that he still hadn't completely accepted it, but without being any more obstinate, he disappeared. `
`......Even though Kanon-kun came to give me words of comfort when I was down... `
`Even so, I was dejected again because it wasn't 'him'. `
`That in itself...was a sin. `
`It went far beyond any dream the likes of me could be permitted to see. I don't know my place. `
`...Shannon, who had neglected breakfast, already felt her concentration begin to waver. `
`...But if she didn't finish up cleaning the reception hall, she wouldn't receive Natsuhi's permission to eat. `
`That cruel Natsuhi had surely told the kitchen something to that effect. `
`...I have to respectfully receive Madam's punishment. `
`That's right. `
`My position in the world is furniture, ...and I've been intoxicated by a dream that's beyond me... `
`I finished cleaning the hallway and went to the reception hall. `
`Maybe my hunger made my nose more sensitive. `
`I could sense a delicious aroma wafting from the kitchen, even though it was far away, and my empty stomach was encouraged even more. `
`...Until I finished up here, I wouldn't get any soup. `
`I just had to resolve myself to doing it. `
`Several portraits were hung in the reception hall. `
`One of those portraits...was thought to hold a special meaning amongst the servants. `
`...It was the portrait of the witch. `
`That wasn't its true name, but everyone in the mansion called it that. `
`The name of the woman with elegant blonde hair, drawn as the subject of that portrait, was Beatrice. `
`...It was whispered that she might be the former mistress of Kinzo, the Family Head. `
`......And also that she was the great witch who had given Kinzo the gold of the legend. `
`The witch, Beatrice, master of the night on Rokkenjima. `
`She was gracious to those who respected her, but she would surely curse those who made light of her. `
`It was in Shannon's character not to neglect rules and beliefs such as those. `
`...So she thought of the portrait of her other master as that person herself, and always treated it carefully, treasuring it. `
`...And it had become part of her daily routine to tell the witch, who only existed inside the portrait, the secrets of her heart. `
`...She was furniture. `
`Furniture doesn't complain. `
`Cannot complain. `
`So she had no right to speak her mind about her difficult days. `
`She had no right to open her mouth and say those words. `
`So, ...she at least spoke her mind inside her heart. `
`She spoke her mind inside her heart, using words she couldn't say aloud, ...and protested to the formless witch. `
`Of course, the witch didn't answer. `
`She didn't console, and she didn't laugh it off. `
`...Shannon could only interpret that silence as she liked, as though the witch was responding agreeably. `
`...Beatrice-sama. `
`...Please listen to the story of my worthless self. `
`As Shannon wiped the dust from the witch's portrait, she spoke that inside her heart. `
`......I certainly am incompetent and uncultured, just as Eva-sama said. `
`...I am not a person. `
`...So maybe I have no right to love... `
`...But in that case, why was I given a heart that can know love? `
`...At that point, Shannon held back her tears for a moment. `
`The sound of the rain, which had started falling, along with the chill air in the reception hall, made her feel as though her shabbiness had increased another level. `
`"Real furniture...doesn't have anything like a heart. `
`So they don't have to love people, right? `
`So they don't feel pain. `
`...If I'm just another piece of furniture, ...why do I have a heart? `
`......If it's going to be this painful and this harsh, ......I wish I was never given a heart like this......!" `
`......I see. `
`So, a heart was given to furniture. `
`It would seem that even that man is capable of some quite amusing things, every now and then... `
`*cackle*cackle*...! `
`"Wha............" `
`The witch who never answered or laughed... `
`answered... `
`...and laughed. `
`Was it my imagination? `
`Was I hearing things? `
`No, that's wrong. `
`...After all, the next words became a 'voice', and I could hear them, not with my heart, but with my ears... `
`"Humans have continually searched for the elements that make up the world, since before the modern era. `
`It is said that in ancient times, the Greeks tried explaining the world with the four elements of wind, fire, water, and earth. `
`And after that, over several millennia, humans added several elements to those four, `
`trying to explain the world with several interpretations such as the five elements, the six elements, the seven elements, the eight elements, and the twelve elements, `
`but they were never able to describe the one sole truth that exists, the 'single element'." `
`"......However, a single man appeared by the guidance of a star...and finally explained the single element that makes up the world. `
`Know what it is...?" `
`"...............e... `
`.........ah, `
`.........wh... `
`......wh-who........." `
`Shannon fearfully turned around... `
`Right there, ...she 'existed'. `
`Not as an illusion, but as a reality. `
`The contrast made by the lightning made it clear that this was no mere daydream. `
`"......It's 'love'. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!" `
`The witch of the portrait elegantly held a golden pipe to her mouth and giggled. `
`...She laughed at the ignorance that causes humankind's thoughts to stray far from the most simple answer. `
`"That man explained everything in the world with love. `
`That is the single element. `
`That man fully explained how the world was constructed with the smallest possible number. `
`...How simple and clear, how splendid, exhilarating, pleasant and thrilling. `
`...The year that man was finally born is called the start of the modern era. `
`...*cackle*cackle*!" `
`Shannon lost any words to speak. `
`She thought that when first meeting an unknown guest, her first words should be to ask that person's name. `
`But without saying anything, ...Shannon knew this person's name, so she refrained. `
`No, ...surely it would be the greatest disrespect for someone who lived or worked on this island to ask this woman her name. `
`After all, ...she was the other master of this island, besides Kinzo. `
`"...B-Beatrice-sama......" `
`"Indeed. `
`I am Beatrice. `
`......Even after a thousand years, I see that people still always give me that look when we first meet. `
`...*cackle*." `
`The witch giggled at how Shannon's reaction didn't betray her expectations. `
`Shannon realized that she had met with a being that mustn't be met with, and she took a step backwards. `
`...That's where the wall and the portrait were, so even as she gazed at the witch, the witch's portrait was touching her back. `
`"The source of your troubles is love. `
`......Love, the single element that makes up this world. `
`In other words, it is everything in this world. `
`......When it is lacking, then your world is lacking too. `
`It is no different than scooping water into a canteen with a hole in it. `
`...Even if you scoop and scoop, that eternal desert of the heart never fills. `
`It is the original sin that humans are founded upon and everything is made of." `
`"Understand? `
`When Adam and Eve put the fruit of knowledge to their lips, love is what they learned of. `
`...Because of that, humans were chased out of the garden and became fully 'human'. `
`Which means that knowing love and suffering is what makes one human. `
`...You kind-hearted child. `
`You ought to be praised. `
`Now that you have gained this knowledge, you are no longer furniture. `
`You are now 'human'. `
`I recognize that with all the authority of my name." `
`".........Umm, ......uuu......" `
`"Hmph. `
`Is it hard for a common person to understand? `
`...Very well then. `
`*cackle*cackle*... `
`Forgive me. `
`It has been a long time since I have spoken with a human. `
`Allow me to apologize for my talkativeness." `
`Without waiting for a reply from Shannon, Beatrice laughed pleasantly for a while. `
`"Perhaps this isn't much by way of an apology, `
`...but I would be willing to grant that wish of yours with my power, if you so desire." `
`"...Huh...?" `
`The meaning of those words surprised Shannon even more than the witch's sudden appearance. `
`"I am offering to bring you and the one you love together. `
`...Normally, I would demand something of equal value in return." `
`"...*cackle* However, I am in a good mood. `
`And you have never failed to pay your respects to me in the past. `
`That is something worth rewarding." `
`"......I-Is that true......?" `
`Normally, Shannon would've been shocked and struck dumb by this seemingly impossible guest. `
`......However, almost as though she was already under the witch's spell, `
`...Shannon responded. `
`"With my magic, it would be no trouble at all to arrange for you to be joined with the one you love." `
`'Yes, of course.' `
`...Shannon almost said that without thinking, but held back with her last bit of common sense. `
`After all, this is a witch. `
`A sinister being. `
`The witch Beatrice is clearly trying to slip in through the cracks in my heart and take me prisoner...... `
`That sort of temptation, which so many fairy tale picture books warned me about when I was young, is right in front of me now. `
`"Fear is also a form of respect. `
`It may be pleasant for me, but we will make no progress this way." `
`"...I may not differ much from the image of a detestable witch that you hold in your mind. `
`However, I do bestow my favor upon those who respect me. `
`Aren't humans the same? `
`Well, I doubt any human would bestow a favor upon one with such a hostile attitude." `
`"......M-My apologies... `
`I didn't mean..." `
`Shannon eventually realized how rude she was acting towards this guest. `
`And, ...she finally digested the words that had been spoken to her a short while ago. `
`'You are no longer furniture. `
`Now, you are "human".' `
`...As she reflected upon those words, `
`...Shannon felt as though the witch understood all her worries... `
`"...What was that, umm, `
`...just now... `
`...about a reward?" `
`"I say that I can arrange for you to be joined with the man who has captured your heart. `
`Think of it as a sign of my gratitude for your diligence in polishing my portrait day after day." `
`"..............." `
`"Calm yourself. I ask for nothing in return. `
`I am generous. `
`......However, though I ask for nothing in return, I do have a request." `
`Look, here it comes... `
`Part of Shannon's heart sent her a warning. `
`This is what all those scary picture books she'd read when she was little had warned her about......! `
`"Do you know of the small torii and shrine that have been constructed on the ocean very near this island, which you can see when you gaze at the cliffs...?" `
`...Shannon immediately remembered it. `
`When you reached Rokkenjima by boat, there was a torii and a shrine on a reef that was too small to be called even an islet. `
`I'm pretty sure Kumasawa-san told me its history, but I can't remember it well. `
`...A traveling shugenja, a kind of holy man, had built it or prayed there or something. `
`"...Yes, I know about it, `
`...but why do you bring it up......?" `
`"I will not explain everything including the very basics to one ignorant of demons. `
`Simply put, ...it's causing me trouble. `
`...The truth is...there's a mirror kept inside that shrine. `
`I want you to break it." `
`It was quite a suspicious request. `
`Shannon didn't know the details, but anything stored inside a shrine would have to be something sacred. `
`...And she wants me to break it? `
`Why would a witch ask a human for help, instead of doing it herself...? `
`There was no need for Shannon to speak her thoughts aloud. `
`Beatrice responded to Shannon's reasonable doubt before Shannon could give her answer. `
`"The magical power of that mirror opposes my own. `
`...I cannot explain it well with human words. `
`...For example, let us speak of the differences between utensils. `
`That mirror is a fork, and my power is soup. `
`You cannot drink soup with a fork, correct? `
`If only the resistance of that mirror were gone, I could produce a spoon ideal for drinking soup. `
`...After that, I could drink soup as I pleased, and even dig my way out of a rocky prison. `
`...I could even gouge someone's eye out with it. ...Was that not the phrase? `
`*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"......I-I don't know what you're talking about. `
`...If my poor education is to blame, I apologize." `
`"It comes down to this. `
`If you take action and break that annoying mirror for me, `
`I shall grant your wish as a reward." `
`"...I am in quite a good mood today. `
`You may even change your wish and receive all the gold I bestowed upon Kinzo, if you so desire. `
`*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"......I-I refuse......" `
`"...What?" `
`When she heard Shannon's words, Beatrice realized for the first time that her expectations had been betrayed. `
`"If you have a reason, tell me. `
`If there has been some misunderstanding, I shall resolve it." `
`"......I-I don't really understand the reason. `
`......But...up until now, this island had been at peace, and nothing bad has happened. `
`...So, even if I don't break the mirror, the peace that has existed until today should continue into the future." `
`"Hmm... `
`Yes, yes, you are quite right. `
`It's just as you say. `
`If you don't break the mirror, the same unbreakable days that have passed until now will continue into tomorrow and the next day. `
`Why don't I give you an absolute guarantee?" `
`"I shall stake my name, Beatrice, on it. `
`{i:The unbreakable days before this time will continue into tomorrow and the next day}. `
`And for eternity, in perpetuity." `
`Shannon felt overwhelmed by an eerie illusion. `
`The mirror probably existed for the purpose of restraining the witch. `
`...So, if Shannon broke it, the person who stood to gain was supposedly the witch herself. `
`...And yet, Shannon felt somehow that she had to do it for her own sake. `
`It felt like some premise had been switched around... `
`"I will do nothing but grant you a chance to bring your feelings to fruition. `
`...It's up to you to decide whether you'll break it or not. `
`If you break it, I shall grant your wish." `
`"If you don't, the tomorrows that came before today will continue for all eternity. `
`Your wish will not be granted for all time. `
`...Do you understand? `
`Do you see what I mean? `
`*cackle*cackle*." `
`The witch was speaking. `
`She was pressing Shannon, saying she must break the mirror if she ever wanted to be united with George. `
`It was a declaration...that Shannon's feelings would never be brought to fruition unless she broke it... `
`"...Please, ...stop it... `
`I don't... `
`want to hear something like that......!" `
`"It was never my goal to cause you pain. `
`...Oh well. `
`When love leads to madness, that is when we see the true charm of humanity. `
`Enjoy that emotion to your heart's content." `
`"However, if you wish to borrow my power, feel free to break that mirror at any time. `
`And then you may yell my name and awaken me. `
`I will certainly keep my promise. `
`...This way, you should have no complaints, right? `
`I won't force you to decide right now. `
`Easy, is it not?" `
`Was it really such an easy thing to do? `
`...No, it certainly wasn't. `
`To Shannon, who was burning with infatuation and worried by love, being tempted constantly and eternally with a way out was truly a cruel trial... `
`"I won't set a time limit on that promise, `
`...but there is a time limit on the magic that can grant your wish. `
`...That limit is not of my making. `
`The one you love will decide it himself. `
`......You see my meaning?" `
`"......N-No, I don't understand." `
`"When the one you care for finds the partner to whom he ought to pledge his love, that limit will be reached. `
`...I may be a witch, but I am no demon. `
`I possess no magic to tear apart a pair of those who love each other... `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!" `
`The one you love will soon be attending a marriage meeting, yes...? `
`You may have stronger feelings for that man than anyone else in the world. `
`However, that doesn't mean you are the most suitable partner for him, does it...? `
`{i:I know} with whom he will be having his marriage meeting. `
`{i:That girl is the most suitable} for Ushiromiya George in the entire world. `
`She came from a good school, achieved good grades, and possesses both composure and thoughtfulness. `
`She is more beautiful than you, wiser than you, {i:more suitable than you}. `
`How could an ignorant, incompetent, uncultured girl like you be suitable? `
`You know better than anyone. `
`There are none less suitable than you! `
`Even imagining that you and Ushiromiya George could be joined is sinful, and foolish, foolish, foolish, know your place!! `
`Have you forgotten to be grateful for your education? `
`Know your place. `
`George is the eldest grandson carrying Father's blood. `
`He's a person who may bear the burden of the Ushiromiya family someday in the future. `
`To answer to that expectation, he has studied tirelessly, entered a wonderful college, and is getting wonderful grades. `
`Did you really think you could snatch George away, you uneducated, incompetent, unqualified, uncultured servaaaant? `
`*giggle*giggle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!" `
`"...St-Stop it, don't bully Shannon!! `
`Who the hell are you?!!" `
`At that time, as Shannon held her head, trying to protect her heart from the blade of Beatrice's words, Kanon ran in front of her. `
`Kanon didn't care who this woman was. `
`If this was an enemy tormenting Shannon, whom he loved and respected as a sister, nothing else mattered. `
`"......Kanon-kun, `
`...stay back...! `
`This person is...!" `
`".................." `
`It seemed Kanon also realized that the being standing before him was the witch of the portrait. `
`And also...that she was something to be feared. `
`"...I simply wished to give Shannon a chance to claim her reward, but it seems I said too much and ended up hurting her. `
`I must apologize for that." `
`"...But I shall leave behind that promise as a reward to you. `
`If you need my power, call me at any time. `
`I have already told you how." `
`"......Well then, let us call it a night. `
`Hostile gazes may be pleasant, but they damage your beauty, yes? `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*..." `
`"Disappear...!! `
`I don't know who you are, but you're threatening Shannon! `
`Don't ever show yourself again!!" `
`Kanon's words seemed to deeply annoy the witch. `
`"...Watch your language, lowborn. `
`...I may be gracious to those who respect me, but I am brutal to those who do not..." `
`While she still smiled, the witch's face began to twist itself... `
`Then, an oppressive feeling that couldn't be noticed with any of the five senses gradually filled the room... `
`Even though they couldn't understand it, they immediately realized it was something terrifying... `
`When you swim in the ocean and something large passes by in the water beneath you, you want to escape to land even before you learn what it is. `
`...That's exactly what this was like! `
`"...P-Please stop, Beatrice-sama!! `
`Kanon-kun is still a child. `
`I apologize for his language!" `
`".................." `
`"............!" `
`Kanon placed his body between the witch and Shannon. `
`...There was tense sweat on his forehead. `
`At that time, the witch certainly held Kanon's fate in the palm of her hand. `
`...She didn't even need to lift a finger. `
`She held a grasp on his fate so tight that a single twist of her smile could easily crush it... `
`Kanon understood that as well. `
`So he started sweating. `
`His knees felt weak... `
`However, Beatrice abruptly released that feeling of tension and laughed. `
`"......Very well. `
`If you ask, I will forgive you just this once. `
`...Kanon, is it? `
`In deference to her, I shall forgive you tonight and send you off. `
`You ought to thank me. `
`Well then, let us call it a night." `
`"......In parting, I shall leave you with a small souvenir. `
`Hold out the palm of your left hands, you two." `
`When Beatrice grinned broadly and snapped her fingers, `
`their left hands stretched out in front of them against their will...and their palms opened. `
`It was a strange sensation, as though only their left hands now belonged to someone else. `
`It felt like only their left hands had become puppets, `
`which were being pulled by strings hanging down from the ceiling. `
`"Wh-What... `
`are you trying to do...?!" `
`Kanon resisted, but he couldn't retract his hand of his own free will. `
`"Don't struggle. `
`It will be over soon." `
`When Beatrice held her pipe aloft, a gold-colored, sparkling dust came out of the smoke and hovered in the air. `
`...That sparkle eventually became several gold butterflies. `
`The beautiful butterflies danced freely throughout the reception hall, forming a fantastical and beautiful world. `
`...And two of those butterflies alighted on the palms of Shannon's and Kanon's hands. `
`"?!" `
`"Ouch...!" `
`There was a sharp pain, as though they had been burned. `
`When the two of them tried to examine their palms, that hold on their bodies, which had been there a second ago, had gone without a trace. `
`"......A-A mark...? `
`What is..." `
`There was now a tiny burn mark on the palm of her hand. `
`...And it was shaped like a butterfly... `
`"Wh-What is this supposed to be...?" `
`Apparently, Kanon had the same mark on his hand. `
`He stared at the witch hatefully. `
`"A simple greeting. `
`I have no hidden motive. `
`...It is nothing more than a bruise, so it will heal in just a few days. `
`There's not even any need to care for it. `
`I made that mark so that tomorrow, you will not forget that I truly was here, and that I made a promise with you." `
`"......An encounter with me can be quite shocking. `
`...Sometimes, when the next morning comes, people try to think of such an encounter as a dream or an illusion. `
`......You ought to consider this slowly and carefully, Shannon. `
`...And you should probably take a good rest, look at my mark tomorrow morning, and try considering it again." `
`"I shall not coerce you in any way. `
`You should freely decide your future, by your own will. `
`......Still, to think that one could obtain the object of their desire for such a small price... `
`Surely, this would annoy to no end the great artists who write plays about blighted love. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"Well then, let us meet again when the chance arises. `
`How entertaining it is to have a conversation again after so much time. `
`Goodbye, furniture. `
`Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!" `
`Beatrice's body crumbled like smoke and blew away. `
`...It was golden smoke...no, a cloud of gold butterflies. `
`They scattered in all directions inside the reception hall, ...leaving a golden splash before disappearing into thin air. `
`......After that, only the cold silence was left. `
`It was so silent, it made both of them think they might've been daydreaming until just a moment ago... `
`...Which was why the witch had left those marks. `
`She had done so to make it impossible for them to think of this as a daydream. `
`As Shannon and Kanon remembered the butterfly bruises on their hands and the pain they'd felt when they'd been made, `
`they kept standing still, stunned...... `
`And from that moment on... `
`...Shannon was tormented by days of suffering and conflict...... `
