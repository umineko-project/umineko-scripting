`"Whaaaaaaat?! `
`What do you mean, separate rooms?! `
`So wait, you and George nii-san stayed in different rooms on purpose?!" `
`"...Y-Yes... `
`Umm, ...is it really so strange...?" `
`Jessica's cheeks had been stuffed with a chocolate-coated chinsukou biscuit that Shannon had brought as a present from Okinawa, `
`and it all came flying out at Shannon when Jessica cried out... `
`"...Sh-Shannon, why did you even go on a trip to Okinawa...? `
`You were even alone with George nii-san!" `
`"Well, umm, ...he said there was a huge aquarium in Okinawa and invited me to go... `
`And...I like fish and stuff..." `
`"No, that's not the point!! `
`We're talking about a healthy guy and girl going on an overnight trip, right?! `
`And you're saying there weren't even any hugs and kisses?! `
`And seriously, what's up with the guy and girl staying in different rooms?!!" `
`"As for k-kisses, no comment. `
`Ah, but we did hug... `
`George-san's chest was warm..." `
`"That's not the point!! `
`Aah, geez! `
`Why do couples like this exist?! `
`Aaah, geez!! `
`I can't take it anymore!" `
`From Shannon's point of view, it was an incredibly happy trip for various reasons, `
`but it looked like Jessica found their pace to be pretty irritating. `
`For a while, Jessica chewed her present, `
`complaining about romance and pretending to faint in agony on her bed. `
`Shannon and George had chosen to go to Okinawa because there was a huge aquarium there. `
`They did this because an aquarium had given them the opportunity to start going out. `
`Since their relationship had started at an aquarium, having their first overnight trip also be to an aquarium must have held some commemorative value. `
`"That's like a huge commemorative turning point! `
`And your first overnight trip!! `
`How could you not make all kinds of progress there?! `
`But instead, `
`you both got separate rooms?! `
`A couple taking two single rooms?! `
`Aah, geez, seriously, what's wrong with you?!" `
`"...Err, umm, ......but we are both unmarried... `
`...George-san says showing restraint is good manners for a couple..." `
`"Like I said, the whole point of this overnight trip was so you could overcome that stage, right?! `
`You should be way beyond just kissing and hugging by now!" `
`"M-Milady, I don't know what you mean by that, `
`b-but George-sama was a real gentleman with me until the end. `
`"That is, I mean, `
`...I also... `
`wondered if those things would happen, you know, `
`...but even though we are going out... `
`I-I mean, it's not like we're married or anything..." `
`"These things you seem to be expecting... `
`......umm, should only be done after making a vow before God, umm, `
`...a-a-and... `
`au." `
`Shannon's face got bright red. `
`She made a circle with both hands, restlessly intertwining, separating and making heart marks with them. `
`Apparently, the dramatic progress Jessica had looked forward to hadn't happened, `
`but it seemed to have been a very important experience for Shannon in her own way. `
`...In the end, whether Jessica was jealous of Shannon or made fun of her, it didn't change the fact that Shannon had a huge lead on her. `
`"Aah, I want a boyfriend toooo!! `
`I can't believe you got ahead of me!! `
`Even though we promised that we'd find boyfriends at the same time, you beat me, `
`aarrrrrrgh!" `
`"U-Umm... `
`You're a wonderful person, Milady, so I'm sure you'll find someone wonderful much quicker than me..." `
`"Don't try to console me!! `
`Shannon, you traitor, get out, shut uuup! `
`*cough*cough*, *cough*cough*cough*!!" `
`Jessica threw several cushions at her. `
`But midway, she had an asthma attack and started to choke pretty badly. `
`Shannon hurriedly ran over to a nearby side table and started searching around on top of it. `
`A cute basket was placed there, and inside of it was Jessica's bronchodilator. `
`Shannon picked it up and handed it over to Jessica. `
`Jessica's asthma attacks always came suddenly. `
`Because of that, she always needed to carry this medicine around. `
`She breathed in the medicine and, after a while, managed to overcome her choking as her asthma finally settled down. `
`Shannon thought this a good chance to leave and tried to exit the room after bowing courteously... `
`As she did, one more small cushion came flying and hit Shannon on the head. `
`She noticed that Jessica was on the verge of crying, half of her face buried in her last and favorite cushion. `
`That face was red and meek... `
`"...M-Milady...?" `
`"...Sh-Shannon, `
`be honest with me... `
`......Is my... `
`hairdo and stuff...weird...?" `
`"What are you saying...? `
`I think your hair is very beautiful." `
`"Then...then, then, are my eyes strange, or maybe my nose? `
`...Or is it the way I talk after all...? `
`Is that why I can't get a boyfriend...?" `
`"Of course not. `
`Milady, you are wonderful enough as you are. `
`And I think your charm will keep on increasing more and more from now on." `
`" ......But I'm the only one who can't find a boyfriend... `
`Saku and Hina managed to get boyfriends, but only I can't... `
`Is it because I don't have any charm after all...? `
`You know, everyone says they'll bring their boyfriends to the cultural festival... `
`And I was so sure I'd have a boyfriend before then, so I started bragging... `
`......There's no way I'll get a boyfriend. `
`I'm...I'm the only one..." `
`Before she realized it, Jessica was shedding huge tears. `
`Jessica didn't really feel like crying, and of course, she felt like supporting Shannon's progress in love as a friend. `
`...However, as she had cheered Shannon on, her true feelings had suddenly gotten mixed in, and she couldn't help but shed tears... `
`...Shannon understood Jessica's innocent and easily injured heart. `
`The rough style of speech Jessica usually used... `
`was all just an attempt to protect that fragile heart. `
`...As a daughter and successor to the Ushiromiya family, and as a girl isolated on Rokkenjima, the only person she could expose her true feelings to was Shannon. `
`Shannon understood that. `
`So, ...she strongly regretted acting smug, even if it was only a little. `
`"...S-Sorry... `
`I'm so weird, crying like this. `
`Sorry, ...*sniffle*." `
`"You are a wonderful person, Milady. `
`There's no way you won't find a wonderful man..." `
`"......Sh-Shannon, it's about time, right? `
`If you don't go quickly, Genji-san and Mom will get mad. `
`I'm just fine, so hurry up...! `
`Heheh, sorry for crying like this. `
`......I'm such a moron." `
`Jessica faced away, acting as though she didn't really want to trouble Shannon, `
`waving her hand as though chasing Shannon away. `
`Shannon took that as a sign that Jessica didn't want to be bothered anymore, `
`bowed her head, and left the room... `
`When Shannon's footsteps disappeared into the distance, Jessica lay down on her bed, still hugging a cushion. `
`...Her expression was still a little meek, with tears in her eyes, `
`...but for the first time in a long time, she had a very, very quiet and honest conversation with her heart. `
`"I also... `
`...want to fall... `
`in love..." `
`As Shannon happily watered the flower beds in the garden, she sensed someone's presence. `
`She turned around, thinking that if one of the family had come to visit, she must greet them, `
`...but what she saw was that witch. `
`"...B-Beatrice-sama......" `
`"It's been quite some time. `
`How are you? `
`Has your relationship with the one you love progressed since last we met?" `
`As Beatrice sat on the rose arch, she happily blew on her pipe. `
`Sitting in a place like that would crush the roses, `
`and it might have been dangerous if the arch fell over, ...but this was a witch, after all. `
`Showing concern for her safety was probably a waste of time. `
`"...Y-Yes. `
`Thanks to you, ...it's going smoothly." `
`"Naturally. The effects of my magic are immediate. `
`Perhaps you feel your meeting was a predetermined fate. `
`However, that is a mistake. Don't even think fate has anything to do with it." `
`"......I-I understand that." `
`The witch was calling attention to something. `
`Two things, actually. `
`First, that Shannon's relationship with George was a fate that'd be absolutely impossible under normal circumstances. `
`...Second, that the power of the witch was great enough to overturn that fact. `
`Shannon had just gotten wrapped up in those sweet days...and had started believing the illusion that all fate revolved around her. `
`...But she remembered the witch's words. `
`Originally, her relationship with George had been impossible... `
`...no, it might be impossible in the future as well... `
`"...*cackle*cackle* Sorry, please forgive me. `
`It's just like doctors. `
`You cling to them when you're worried about your health, but after you're healed, you forget even to thank them. `
`...I've never been thanked as a witch, so I couldn't help acting a little rudely. `
`Forgive me." `
`"......The gratitude I feel has never slipped my mind. `
`...It's thanks to your power that I was able to achieve happiness, Beatrice-sama. `
`...And without that power, the fate that brought me and George-sama together would never have happened. `
`...I have never forgotten that." `
`"Sorry, sorry. `
`It's not like I came here to bully you. `
`Being rude is just part of my personality. `
`Do forgive me. `
`...More importantly, I heard, I heard! `
`So, you went on a trip alone with him. `
`I imagine it must have been quite fun." `
`"Y-Yes! `
`It was very...umm...fun." `
`Shannon's face suddenly lit up. `
`The witch laughed lightly, as though amused by the speed of that transformation. `
`"Already, the one you care for is more than the object of one-sided love. `
`You are a pair of lovers now. `
`...When two people are filled with love, nothing else is needed to establish a complete world. `
`Perhaps you could call that a wonderful, ideal world. `
`Heheheheheh! `
`Even witches would be jealous." `
`Beatrice laughed pleasantly. `
`That smile made her look as though she blessed the lovers' rendezvous from the bottom of her heart, without a trace of malice. `
`After that day, Beatrice had shown herself before Shannon every once in a while. `
`Even now, Shannon thought of her as an unsettling being. `
`...However, she was also indebted to this person for the magic that led to her current relationship with George. `
`So Shannon tried with all her might not to act surprised or scared. `
`"Th-That's right. `
`...Umm, Beatrice-sama, `
`I bought some sweets as a souvenir from our trip. `
`...Would you...umm...like to try some too?" `
`"Oh??? `
`A souvenir for a witch......?" `
`It seemed that even a witch who boasted of living for one thousand years hadn't imagined that she'd receive a souvenir from a sweet lovers' trip. `
`When she saw that surprised expression, Shannon thought of this witch as a friend for the first time. `
`"Hohoh, an Eastern cookie made from wheat flour and lard. `
`To wrap that in Western chocolate is truly a blending of the Japanese and Western styles, the silk road of sweets." `
`"......What? `
`What's so funny?" `
`"N-Nothing. `
`My apologies." `
`This witch, who surely held a terrifying power, `
`was chomping down on sweets one after another, making a sound like a squirrel stuffing walnuts into its mouth. `
`After a while, Shannon couldn't conceal her laughter. `
`"Hmmm, a good meal. `
`...I should serve you some Dolce Vita from Nero one of these days. `
`Roses are the symbol of eternal love. `
`I believe a rose dolce would be appropriate for you now." `
`The witch was in a great mood, fully enjoying modern candy. `
`"Umm, ......here. `
`I truly am grateful. `
`I believe you've done more than enough for me already, so I'm returning this." `
`The thing Shannon had softly set on the table...was a gold-colored butterfly brooch. `
`"There is no need to return it. `
`If you continue holding that, your relationship should remain firm in perpetuity." `
`"...Maybe it was the power of magic that brought us together, `
`but I think only the two of us working together can turn that into something that lasts forever." `
`"Hmmm. `
`...Love and roses are the same. `
`Too much fertilizer causes the roots to rot. `
`Some flowers cannot be raised without hard work. `
`In that case, do as you wish. `
`You may wear it or keep it in a box. `
`That is my goodwill, given to you. `
`Having you return it to me won't please me at all." `
`"Ah, ...m-my apologies...! `
`That's not what I..." `
`"*cackle*cackle* `
`No harm has been done. `
`That brooch is already yours. `
`If you treasure that proof of our friendship, it would indeed bring me some comfort." `
`"You may hold on to it and gain its benefits. `
`Or you may keep it in a box. `
`If you wish, you may even give it to another who is worrying about love. `
`...Or you could simply treasure it. `
`Of course, it would pain my heart if you wasted it." `
`According to Beatrice, she had appeared several times in the past in response to a person's summons, to give them some tool imbued with magical power. `
`...However, when most people used that power to resolve their worries, `
`they quickly grew unsettled by it, forgot their former gratitude, and threw away the tools they had been given with disgust. `
`"So, it is quite rare for me to be thanked for my goodwill. `
`...In fact, this might even be the first time. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*." `
`The witch laughed heartily, but it looked like a sad laugh in Shannon's eyes. `
`She herself had been like that in the past...no, maybe she was still like that now. `
`Beatrice was definitely a witch, with a strange and terrifying power. `
`Most people probably wouldn't want to stick around her if they could help it. `
`Surely, even those who had relied on that strange power sometimes felt fear rather than gratitude as a result. `
`...It must have deeply hurt the witch to have that happen over and over. `
`Since the time she had started thinking that way, `
`...Shannon had tried to stop being frightened of Beatrice. `
`This was surely something that had tormented the witch for over a thousand years... `
`Maybe she really liked those sweets. `
`Beatrice, who normally spoke abusively, praised the black tea that Shannon served her and looked to be in remarkably high spirits. `
`After doing that for a while, the witch and the servant grew animated in their discussion of the trip with George. `
`The things Shannon actually knew about Beatrice were surprisingly few. `
`First off, she was a ghost-like being who appeared in unexpected places at unexpected times. `
`And it seemed that not everyone could perceive that she was there. `
`Apparently, everyone has something called a wavelength, and the ability to perceive witches varies greatly among different people. `
`Only Shannon and Kanon could interact with her enough to exchange words like this. `
`...There were a few people who could sense her presence, but most people couldn't even feel that much. `
`From what Beatrice said, Krauss and his wife in particular had zero magical talent. `
`And no matter how much she followed them around, they would never notice her. `
`Once earlier, when Shannon messed up and Natsuhi got really mad at her, Beatrice had started playing around, hitting Natsuhi on the head with her pipe. `
`...I see, Natsuhi really doesn't notice a thing. `
`But Shannon, watching that, had burst out laughing without thinking, and had gotten scolded even more. `
`"Then...what about the Master? `
`I hear he's been doing research in magic, so I'm sure he'll be able to notice you, Beatrice-sama." `
`".........Kinzo is the same. `
`He also has a pitiful lack of magical talent. `
`...It's the blood. `
`He has so little talent that I pity him." `
`"...............?" `
`As soon as they started talking about Kinzo, it felt like the atmosphere around Beatrice changed. `
`She had spoken about Krauss and the rests' lack of magic talent as though she looked down on them, but she spoke of Kinzo in a different way. `
`Anyone connected to the Ushiromiya family would know about Kinzo's Legend of the Gold. `
`...According to that, Kinzo was given the gold after summoning the witch, Beatrice. `
`...In other words, she must have had some kind of relationship with Kinzo. `
`"That was because...he succeeded despite having not even a scrap of talent. `
`...He kept studying by himself like mad and managed to become a magician." `
`"And that's......something really incredible, right...?" `
`"...Indeed." `
`The witch, who usually looked down on people, was uncharacteristically offering her praise. `
`...While she lambasted him by saying he had no talent, she praised his efforts. `
`"And then......the Master summoned Beatrice-sama with the power of magic..." `
`"Indeed. `
`...Well, I only answered the summons on a whim. `
`After all, in this period where magic has long been denied, here was a man who was without a scrap of talent, yet so desperate to succeed. `
`I thought I'd drop by and poke some fun at him, and that's when my luck ran out. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*." `
`Her choice of words highlighted how much of a disaster this had been for her. `
`Shannon hesitated over whether it would be safe to continue this discussion, but Beatrice continued on her own, ignoring Shannon. `
`"After all, his contract did have a proper format and set of rules. `
`Various procedures were mixed up, but...well, in deference to his enthusiasm, I graciously accepted his contract. `
`...Then, I gave him a mountain of gold." `
`"And then the Master...used that gold and succeeded in business...and grew his wealth into what it is today." `
`"Indeed. His talent in magic was minimal, but it seems he had a knack for business and gambling. `
`...Or perhaps it was due to the bravery and madness that led him to risk everything on unreasonable bets. `
`...Madness sometimes acts as magical power. `
`I see, if you look at it that way, perhaps it isn't quite fair to say he was completely lacking in magical talent. `
`*cackle*cackle*..." `
`Shannon felt like she was daydreaming. `
`While everyone in the Ushiomiya family knew the story of how Kinzo idolized black magic, summoned a witch, and received the gold, in actuality, it was all rambling that no one believed in. `
`And now, Shannon was having this story confirmed by the witch herself... `
`She felt a little flustered by this incredible secret that only she knew. `
`"Once Kinzo gained his vast fortune, he could realize every dream that can be satisfied by objects obtainable in the human world. `
`......And in the end, he searched for the truth of this world." `
`"The truth...of this world?" `
`"...The single element that makes up the world. `
`Kinzo, who had gained everything one can obtain in the human world, searched for that, the final desire humans seek." `
`The single element. `
`......She seemed to remember the witch using that word before. `
`When Beatrice saw Shannon trying to remember what that was, she laughed bitterly, waving her hand and saying there was no need to worry. `
`"...I underestimated Kinzo just a tad. `
`I truly didn't expect him to display such power." `
`"...And thanks to that, I'm in this state. `
`I've been sewn in place on this island for several decades now, without even a friend to drink tea with. `
`...No matter whom I try to talk to, my voice doesn't reach them, and no matter where I go, I cannot do anything. `
`Such boring decades." `
`As she laughed in self-derision, she tapped her teacup with her finger. `
`It made the light sound of pottery. `
`...Shannon didn't know whether the word 'self-derision' was really an accurate expression to describe the look on the witch's face. `
`Shannon didn't understand everything, but she could more or less figure out the situation. `
`...And it was probably a topic that she couldn't press the witch on easily, not unless the witch started talking about it herself. `
`To sum up everything she had said up until now... `
`Beatrice, who had been summoned by Kinzo's magic, could not leave this island for some reason. `
`And she had lost her power and her form, living her days in boredom. `
`During that time, her words had reached Shannon, who never forgot to show sincere respect for the witch. `
`And Shannon had helped the witch regain her power, if only a little bit. `
`...As a result, it was now possible for the witch to drink tea with Shannon like this... `
`"...Beatrice-sama, what in the world was that mirror you told me to break?" `
`"Aaah, that. `
`......Long ago, it seems various things happened on the islands around this area. `
`Because of that, malignant forces gathered here and began to draw in an evil distortion. `
`It seems a traveling eastern magician or something built a shrine for the repose of souls and sealed them in there." `
`"...That in itself has nothing to do with me, but unfortunately, that magical power rested on a different foundation than mine. `
`It created a strong interference with my magic and was extremely bothersome." `
`"Is that how it was...? `
`And I just assumed it existed only to seal you, Beatrice-sama..." `
`"I was not its target. `
`But it was a divine mirror. `
`As a result, my power was sealed away. `
`...To use food as an example, maybe it would go something like this. `
`Let's say the Western food I ordered is being made in the kitchen. `
`However, when they try to set the table, the area for the guest seating is in the Japanese style with Japanese-style dishes. `
`So, the kitchen is unable to serve a plate that would be out of place, and no matter how long I wait, my Western food won't arrive. ...Something like that." `
`"So, you destroyed that Japanese-style guest seating and returned the area to a blank slate for a time. `
`Thanks to that, the meal I had ordered was finally delivered, and my power came back, you could say. `
`However, so far, only the aperitif has arrived. `
`It will still be quite some time before the main dish. `
`As I am now, I'm even more fragile than a shoe store fairy." `
`".........pf... `
`...ahahahahahahaha." `
`"Mu. `
`What's so amusing?" `
`"Nothing... `
`I just thought your metaphor was pretty funny. `
`I never would've thought to use a story about food as a metaphor for magic." `
`"I thought it a rather skillful comparison, but I certainly didn't expect it to be laughed at. `
`I'm a bit offended." `
`A slightly sulky expression rose to the witch's face. `
`...It wasn't a strange expression at all to be appearing on the face of some friends as they enjoyed their tea. `
`"...Although I may not look it, I was known for doing extremely brutal things in the past. `
`...I've gotten soft. `
`Now I can even have a foolish discussion while drinking tea with a human." `
`She was probably talking to herself. `
`As Beatrice gazed at the sea birds tracing the horizon, she put her tea to her lips again. `
`"...The clouds have come out. `
`When the ocean loses its brilliance, it's nothing more than a gray puddle." `
`"You think so? `
`...I think the ocean is a beautiful deep blue, even when it gets cloudy." `
`"......Hmph." `
`Maybe the witch noticed the deep meaning behind Shannon's words. `
`...She laughed lightly and set down her empty teacup. `
`"...It seems those things buried in your eyes aren't black pebbles anymore. `
`How is it? `
`...Do you see how it feels for furniture to be reborn as a human?" `
`"......Yes. `
`...I never knew the world was this kind." `
`Since the start of her relationship with George, Shannon's face had grown brighter more often. `
`Her smile had made everything go smoothly and had even changed her fortune. `
`...Shannon made less mistakes in her work than she had before, and the family members' opinion of her was slowly starting to change. `
`Just the other day, she had been surprised when Krauss, who rarely exchanged words with her, had suddenly started talking to her. `
`"You've been wearing a splendid smile more often lately, haven't you? `
`Has something good happened?" `
`"N-No... `
`But...every day is fun, yes." `
`"Hmph. `
`Wonderful. `
`It goes without saying that coffee is more delicious when poured with a smile. `
`...Could I ask for that smile once more?" `
`"...Y-Yes sir!" `
`That had become a chance for Shannon to gain confidence in herself. `
`Of course, it didn't go beyond her own heart, and it wasn't so big a change that anyone would notice. `
`...But she had begun to change, bit by bit. `
`Shannon understood it clearly. `
`Knowing love was the same as gaining a soul. `
`...The same as being reborn, from furniture into a human. `
`There was absolutely nothing mistaken in Beatrice's words. `
`...By knowing love, Shannon had learned what it was to be human. `
`"...These have been unusual snacks. `
`It was time well spent. `
`It's probably about time for you to return to your work, `
`so let us end our tea party now. `
`...After all, it seems a certain person doesn't like seeing us drink tea together." `
`"Huh?" `
`The witch gripped a teaspoon and flipped it with her fingers, sending it up in the air. `
`...After that, it was launched by the fingers of some invisible person...and flew straight into a nearby bush. `
`The bush shook violently, and Kanon came out. `
`...It seemed he had been there for some time, watching their tea party. `
`The spoon was gripped in his hand. `
`...If he hadn't caught it in an instant, it might've hit him hard in the forehead and caused him to start oozing blood. `
`"............" `
`"Do not worry. `
`Our tea party is over now, Kanon." `
`"How long were you there? `
`If you had called to us, I'd have poured you some tea too..." `
`"I imagine that you didn't want to interrupt a pair of women talking, right? `
`*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"............" `
`Kanon kept silent, but there seemed to be a slightly hostile look in his eyes. `
`...On the outside, he acted with respect. `
`But unlike Shannon, Kanon did not trust the witch. `
`When Beatrice hit the table with her pipe, the tea set turned into gold butterflies, which flew upwards all at once. `
`They then scattered in every direction, and the cleanup was already done. `
`"It was fun, Shannon. `
`...Let us meet again if the chance arises. `
`...My magical power is still quite lacking. `
`It's tiring even to show myself." `
`"...If you're that tired, never appear again." `
`Kanon had said it in a small voice, but the witch seemed to have heard it perfectly. `
`She giggled, but did not reply. `
`"Shannon, `
`tell me more about George at our next tea party. `
`There are no snacks sweeter than a person's love life. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle* `
`See you again." `
`Beatrice's body also became gold butterflies, which scattered in all directions and disappeared. `
`...It was a fantastical and beautiful scene, like a blizzard of gold leaf. `
`For a while, Shannon quietly watched the witch's exit... `
`Kanon approached her from behind and spoke with an expression that was drastically different from hers. `
`"......Nee-san, didn't I tell you to stay away from her?" `
`"Beatrice-sama isn't that bad of a person. `
`...Yes, she might be a little shady, but-" `
`"The fact that only we can see her is suspicious enough... `
`That thing isn't human. `
`Who knows what she might be planning?" `
`"Kanon-kun, I think that's a little rude." `
`There was a touch of sternness in Shannon's voice, which was unusual for her. `
`...To Kanon, who knew her well, she must've sounded extremely stern. `
`Kanon, looking excessively surprised considering Shannon's tone, fell silent. `
`"It's true that Beatrice-sama is different from humans. `
`She has a terrifying power, so I think it's right for us to fear and respect her. `
`...Still, I think it's incredibly rude to despise her just because she isn't human." `
`"......I understand what you're trying to say, Nee-san. `
`...You've changed ever since she gave you that brooch. `
`It's like you're her prisoner. `
`She brought you and George-sama together, and now you're indebted to her." `
`"...Don't say things like that." `
`"That thing isn't human. `
`We don't know what she's thinking. `
`So you mustn't trust her. `
`......And we aren't humans either, `
`Nee-san." `
`Kanon's words grew more serious. `
`...Those words probably gouged at Shannon's heart. `
`She bit her lower lip and hung her head. `
`"We are furniture. `
`...Even if we receive names and are treated as humans, that won't change the manner of our birth." `
`You are no longer furniture... `
`Those words Beatrice had given her, which had made her happiest, floated through Shannon's mind... `
`"I am not... `
`...furniture." `
`"No, you are furniture. `
`We are less than human. `
`...Nee-san, you're just pretending to have forgotten, ...pretending to be human. `
`You know that as well as I do." `
`"I...am not furniture. `
`...I'm human...!" `
`"No, you aren't. `
`We have never possessed what it takes to love or be loved." `
`Kanon's criticism seemed to have shifted away from Shannon's meetings with the witch. `
`...Shannon picked up on that quickly. `
`"I heard from Milady. `
`Seriously, what were you thinking? `
`I can't believe you would go on a trip with George-sama...! `
`You've forgotten your place as furniture. `
`You've just been tempted by that witch, mistakenly believing that you've become human!" `
`"Listen, Kanon-kun. `
`......It's true that we're furniture. `
`Lesser beings, inferior to humans. `
`...But if it were possible to make up for what we lack, `
`...wouldn't that be the same as becoming human?" `
`"...Such a thing could never happen." `
`"No, it could. `
`If we can do that, we won't be furniture anymore. `
`We can become human." `
`"......... `
`......Ridiculous. `
`...As if you could ever...do such a thing." `
`Kanon spat those words out, ...but did so weakly and turned away. `
`He was probably giving up. `
`...After all the suffering he'd undergone during those days he'd lived as furniture, his heart was firmly sealed... `
`"...You can do it too, Kanon-kun. `
`...You can become a normal human." `
`"............ `
`Stop it, that's the witch talking." `
`"Yes. `
`Beatrice-sama taught me. `
`...By obtaining the single element of this world, we can become human. `
`Or rather, nobody's human if they don't have 'that'. `
`...That's why people spend their entire lives trying to gain that single element." `
`"I don't understand what you're saying, Nee-san. `
`I don't want to listen to ranting." `
`"Then I'll teach it in a way even you can understand. `
`......Look, see what I'm pointing at?" `
`"......?" `
`Shannon quietly pointed at the sea, towards the horizon. `
`Kanon didn't understand what she meant, and couldn't do anything except look between the horizon and Shannon's expression, which seemed to be posing a riddle. `
`"The sea. `
`...Kanon-kun, what color does the sea look to you?" `
`It was an extremely simple question. `
`For a while, Kanon tried to guess at the meaning behind it, `
`but he couldn't think of anything, so he answered obediently. `
`"...It's a hazy, dark-gray color. `
`So what?" `
`Objectively speaking, the sea, laid out beneath a cloudy sky, could probably be described best by Kanon's words. `
`...But as Shannon closed her eyes and smiled, she shook her head slightly. `
`"It looks deep blue to me." `
`"...Is that what you mean? `
`Like how Japanese people use the word 'blue' to refer to a green traffic light?" `
`"No. `
`...The sea is deep blue. `
`If I understand and you don't, `
`...then that's the difference between us..." `
`Kanon bit his lower lip and was silent for a while. `
`"............ `
`......I...don't understand." `
`"Kanon-kun, `
`...would you stick out your hand?" `
`As Kanon was taken aback, unable to understand what she was saying, she took his arm and opened the palm of his hand. `
`Shannon softly set something there. `
`It was that magic brooch, which she had received from Beatrice. `
`A magic charm, shaped like a gold butterfly, that could bring love to fruition. `
`"This is... `
`...hers...?" `
`"No, this is mine. `
`...So think of it as me and treat it with respect, okay?" `
`"............" `
`After being spoken to like that, he couldn't just throw it away. `
`Kanon didn't know what he should do, and he stood there confused for a while, the brooch still on the palm of his hand. `
`Shannon put the palm of her hand on top of Kanon's, and the brooch was warmed by both of their hands. `
`"This charm holds true magical power. `
`...I'm sure it'll teach you an important emotion, Kanon-kun." `
`"...There's nothing to be learned from that person's magic." `
`"No, there is something. `
`...So wear it. `
`If that's embarrassing, I hear it's okay if you just hide it in your pocket." `
`"......Ridiculous... `
`As if I'd let the magic of that person lead me astray." `
`Even as he said that, Kanon couldn't be cold-hearted towards something Shannon was urging him to take. `
`In the end, Kanon took it and agreed reluctantly, `
`saying he'd prove that he wouldn't surrender to the witch's power. `
`Shannon smiled and nodded back. `
`"I'm sure you'll be able to learn something important from it. `
`...And I'm sure you can become human. `
`And when you do, I'm sure this ocean will look like a beautiful blue to you as well, Kanon-kun." `
`"...Gray is gray no matter how many times you look." `
`"That's wrong, Kanon-kun. `
`...It only looks like that because you have no ****." `
`"Huh...?" `
`Because of the howling wind, he hadn't been able to catch the main point of what she'd just said. `
`So Shannon said it once more. `
`...The single element of the world. `
`She spoke once more of the world where it existed, where the sea was deep blue. `
`"I'm sure you'll be able to see a deep blue ocean too. `
`After all-" `
`Without love, it cannot be 'seen'. `
`"......Who is that?" `
`"...It is Kanon, Master." `
`It was rare for Kinzo to leave his study. `
`...However, the fact that he had didn't mean his noble research had been suspended. `
`He may have left the study because of a change in mood, `
`but that didn't mean the thoughts filling his head were any different from those he had while inside the study. `
`Kanon knew that no matter what the time, speaking to Kinzo when he didn't want to be spoken to would always disturb his research. `
`"It's cloudy out there. `
`Will it get worse?" `
`"Yes. `
`According to the weather report, it could rain at any time. `
`...Shall I bring an umbrella?" `
`"It will not come to that. `
`...Leave me alone for a while. `
`If my children ask, say that you do not know where I am. `
`I am busy on a journey through my own thoughts." `
`"...Certainly. `
`Then, if you would excuse me." `
`Before Kanon finished bowing, Kinzo had already returned to his own world, having forgotten Kanon's presence completely. `
`And once again, he began rambling to himself. `
`Amidst those words, ...the name of that witch popped up many times. `
`"...Ooohh, Beatrice... `
`My hand will not reach your smile... `
`What can I do to revive you, what can I do to make you smile at me once more...? `
`...What is lacking? `
`My research, my materials, my catalyst? `
`Or is it magical power or luck or an oracle...?! `
`Ooohhh, Beatrice, what can I do to see your face one more time...? `
`Ooooooooohhhhhhh......" `
`As Kanon listened to his master's weeping voice with his back turned, he turned around just once. `
`When he did, `
`......right behind his isolated, old master, `
`...was the shadow of a person who shouldn't have been there. `
`It was...the witch. `
`At once, thinking that the witch must be plotting to do Kinzo some harm, `
`Kanon dashed back to Kinzo and tried to form a shield with his body. `
`But when he saw the expression on the witch's face, `
`...that emotion of his vanished. `
`Because Beatrice's expression was... `
`...sorrowful... `
`...or maybe pitying. `
`"You fool, Kinzo... `
`...Can't you 'see' me, even though I am here?" `
`Right behind Kinzo, as he repeated the witch's name over and over, desiring to be reunited with her more than anything else, was the witch herself. `
`And yet, Kinzo didn't notice anything. `
`...When Beatrice tried to rest her hand on his shoulder, he didn't notice. `
`"...Why, why does my hand not reach Beatrice's smile?! `
`Is it the age of the moon, `
`the cycle of the comets, `
`the alignment of the planets?! `
`What is lacking, what is, what is?!!" `
`"......It's useless, Kinzo. `
`...Without love, `
`it cannot be {y:1:'seen'}{n:1:'seen'}." `
`Kanon took the brooch he had received from Shannon out of his pocket. `
`...By learning something new, would he become able to glimpse something he couldn't 'see' now? `
`"............... `
`Without love, it cannot be 'seen'." `
`He looked at Kinzo's back once more. `
`...The witch could no longer be seen there. `
