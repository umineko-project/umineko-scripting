`...Hideyoshi's claim that advertising doubled the taste was apparently right. `
`After being chased out to the guesthouse, the kids and Nanjo had gathered in the cousins' room and were `
`eating the cake that Kumasawa had brought for dessert. `
`It was both wonderful and high-class, topped with lavish amounts of cream and decorated deliciously with fruits, `
`but delicious as it was, it didn't taste quite as good for some reason... `
`"Haha, without Gohda-san selling it, it isn't nearly as good." `
`"And if we asked Kumasawa-san to sell it, she'd just say it's made of mackerel." `
`"Uu-?! `
`Really?! `
`You can make cake from mackerel?!" `
`"Hohohohoh. `
`Absolutely, and as you can see with this very cake, if you mix the squeezed juice of mackerel with flour and eggs before cooking, it comes out all fluffy. `
`Hohohohoh." `
`"That'd be incredible if true. `
`Maybe mackerel cake will show up on the new menu at one of Father's restaurants." `
`"Wahahaha! `
`After all, mackerel's full of nutrients and sounds healthy. `
`It might get really popular with women and the elderly! `
`But I'm not gonna get anywhere near it!" `
`"Girls won't eat something that weird." `
`"Even the elderly would wish to decline." `
`"Hohohohoh! `
`But it's delicious, you know?" `
`Kumasawa was really cheering up the mood with her classic mackerel jokes. `
`...But the sound of the downpouring rain kept turning their attention towards the mystery guest. `
`In the end, they showered Maria with questions again, since she was the only person here to have met Beatrice. `
`"......I can't believe...she was actually telling the truth." `
`"You make it sound like, though you never believed it, this 'Maria meets a witch' business isn't news to you." `
`"...Yeah. `
`I thought it was just one of those fairy tales you'd expect from a dreamy kid that age." `
`"She exists!! `
`Beatrice 'exists'! `
`Every year, when we come to the family conference, I meet her and we play together!" `
`"That's right. `
`Although Beatrice-sama doesn't usually show herself, `
`I hear she sometimes unexpectedly appears before honest people with clean hearts. `
`Hohohoh." `
`'Beatrice' referred to that character in the fairy tale about the Rokkenjima witch. `
`To keep Kinzo in a good mood, the family and servants acted as though they believed in the witch of his delusions. `
`That's how Rokkenjima's fairy tale...or maybe ghost story...had come into being... `
`To the family members who knew that backstory, the fairy tale of the Golden Witch wasn't something to be taken too seriously. `
`...However, they were never able to say that out loud in front of Kinzo. `
`Because of that, the Legend of the Witch carried a lot more weight to someone like young Maria, `
`...who didn't know the story of how it had come into being. `
`That's why Maria believed in the Legend of the Witch. `
`She accepted it entirely. `
`...That was only natural for an imaginative girl who believed in witches. `
`So people had avoided saying things that would betray her dream. `
`...On the contrary, they had worked together to say and do things that would help liven up her dreams without her knowing. `
`"...So when Maria-chan was showing us that candy that supposedly came from Beatrice, `
`...I figured someone subtly slipped it into her handbag." `
`"...I have done similar things a few times in the past, `
`secretly placing sweets somewhere. `
`...I imagine even Kumasawa-san...or rather, all of the servants and everyone in the Ushiromiya family has done it once or twice." `
`"...So, if it'll make a small, innocent kid happy, you might place a sweet somewhere and have everyone join in on keeping the secret alive for her. `
`...Come to think of it, I'll bet you do that kind of thing all the time, George-aniki." `
`"......Who knows." `
`It'd probably be boorish to admit to such a thing out loud. `
`George admitted it while being extremely wary that Maria didn't find out. `
`"In other words, ...it's kinda like Santa Claus. `
`To protect a kid's dreams, the parents plot together and lie, setting presents at the bedside of a child fast asleep." `
`"......After all, you wanna protect a kid's dreams, right? `
`...Obviously, I've known Santa doesn't exist for a long time now, `
`...but if there's no reason to wake up from a dream like that, I wish I could've believed it all my life." `
`"...Because adults know that the world is filled with terrible things, `
`...they all want to at least protect the pure dreams of a child. `
`"Uu-!! `
`Beatrice exists! `
`'Exiiiists'!!!" `
`"Yes, she does. `
`Beatrice-sama does exist, right? `
`Some time ago, when I was drying mackerel to make some black tea, suddenly..." `
`"......Well, it basically goes something like that. `
`...Supposedly, at least." `
`"So, simply put, `
`...this was supposed to be a witch that no one but Maria believed in." `
`"I wouldn't phrase it quite like that. `
`...The point isn't that we didn't believe. `
`We were all trying to give her a chance to believe." `
`So, this is about not betraying a child's innocence. `
`But Santa doesn't exist in reality. `
`If you don't want kids to be all disappointed when they learn the truth, you'd be better off not showing them that dream in the first place. `
`...Is the fact that I think like this proof that I'm still a long way from becoming a full adult? `
`The true nature of the Rokkenjima witch was finally starting taking shape in Battler's mind. `
`...However, their current situation overrode this understanding, `
`and in fact, it completely overturned its very premise... `
`"...So, we thought we knew what was going on, but now Beatrice-sama the witch has actually appeared in reality. `
`Is that it?" `
`"And, judging by how freaked our parents were, it looks like she wasn't an invited guest. `
`...Now it's starting to get interesting." `
`"There's no reason for us to simply assume that a woman called Beatrice doesn't exist. `
`...It's what Uncle Rudolf called a Devil's Proof. `
`......None of us knew that a woman calling herself Beatrice existed." `
`"...But that's not the same as proving that Beatrice doesn't exist." `
`"...Doctor Nanjo, you've been friends with Grandfather for a long time, right?" `
`"............ `
`...At one point during the family conference, I was questioned quite thoroughly by Krauss-san and the others. `
`...They wanted to know if, long ago, Kinzo-san might have had a mistress called Beatrice and an illegitimate child with her." `
`"I get it. `
`Our parents have their heads full with the inheritance problem. `
`So of course, if the daughter of a mistress like that showed up, it'd be troublesome for them." `
`"Krauss-san and the rest probably asked Genji-san about it first. `
`However, Genji-san is an aide who's sworn loyalty to Kinzo-san...and is probably a friend more trusted by Kinzo-san than myself. `
`...I doubt he told them anything. `
`...So next, they went to ask me, as an old friend of his..." `
`"And? `
`......When all is said and done, Doctor Nanjo, `
`...Did Grandfather have a lover called Beatrice?" `
`"......He did. `
`...No, I have never met her. `
`...However, I have heard from Kinzo-san that he had a relationship with a woman like that. `
`......He said she passed away a very long time ago." `
`"...She's dead. `
`...So, did the two of them have a kid?" `
`"That, I do not know. `
`...But Kinzo-san always says that reviving Beatrice is the goal of his research. `
`...Usually, if one loses a mistress but has a child left behind to remember them by, they pour all of their love onto that child. `
`...Therefore, we naturally assumed that there was no such child between Kinzo-san and Beatrice..." `
`".........Hmm? `
`...So, that leaves us with another Devil's Proof." `
`"...Yeah. `
`...It's impossible to prove that a child between him and a mistress 'didn't exist'. `
`...So, now that this child has actually appeared, we have to assume she 'did exist' after all." `
`"That's a bit of a rushed argument. `
`...It's more realistic that someone caught wind of the trouble with the Ushiromiya family inheritance, `
`knew about Grandfather's relationship with a mistress long ago, `
`and impersonated her, trying to take a slice of the inheritance for themselves." `
`"...Sure, that is realistic. `
`...But we can't deny the possibility that she really is an illegitimate child, `
`one who lived in isolation, forgotten by Grandfather, and who's returned for revenge, right...?" `
`"Revenge?! `
`What do you mean?!" `
`"Aaah, sorry, sorry... `
`Guys just like to dramatize stuff to make it sound interesting. `
`I've seen too many weird dramas. `
`Ihihihi!" `
`Normally, that might have come off as a light joke. `
`...But the joke had landed after an uninvited mystery guest calling herself Beatrice... `
`had marched in on the day of the family conference, where the bloody argument that the inheritance had become took center stage. `
`......There was no way Battler's joke would be welcomed with laughter. `
`So, it was a really big help when Nanjo laughed brightly to calm everyone down. `
`"Hahahaha... `
`I see, I see, that does sound quite intriguing. `
`I would love to read a novel with a plot like that." `
`"Well, I don't think it could actually work. `
`...After all, right now, on this island, there's one, two, three...a full 18 people, right? `
`If anyone tries to do something weird, they'll immediately get caught. `
`And thanks to the typhoon, they can't even leave the island. `
`In other words, if you tried to commit some crazy crime, you'd be screwed." `
`"...I agree. `
`In a dead end, without any way to escape, and in a situation where everyone's really suspicious of her, `
`I seriously doubt she could pull off a terrifying revenge drama like that." `
`"Probably not. `
`...In that case, it would be more realistic if she had come in secret, without making her presence known. `
`I simply cannot imagine someone appearing openly to take revenge outside of some historical drama." `
`"Well, who knows, right? `
`Revenge is based on emotion, not logic. `
`If you've got someone willing to go down along with their opponent, they might not be afraid of anything, not even the police or large numbers of people." `
`"It's okay, Jessica-chan. `
`None of the disturbing things we're imagining will happen." `
`"Ihihi! `
`Like the battle royale between our parents over the inheritance isn't disturbing." `
`"...That's right. `
`...Dad and Uncle Rudolf are pretty tough, and Aunt Eva's even trained in the martial arts. `
`...We'll be fine. `
`Yeah..." `
`Jessica didn't say it out loud, but she'd vaguely noticed that her own father stood in opposition to all the other siblings on the inheritance issue. `
`They usually played nice in front of the children, but when that pretense was lifted away, like it had been at dinner, the result would be a tumultuous uproar. `
`After realizing this, it was only natural for Jessica to be frightened at the thought... `
`that her parents might get caught up in some kind of trouble... `
`and become human sacrifices for something terrifying... `
`"Seriously. `
`George-aniki's right. `
`...Nothing's gonna happen. `
`Even if she pretends she's a witch, `
`what can a single {i:human woman} who can't even use magic do?" `
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi..." `
`The sudden, creepy laugh made all of them jump. `
`...And when they realized the strange laugh was coming from Maria, they were shocked again. `
`"......I see. `
`...So that's how you see it, Battler." `
`"...Wh-What is? `
`Don't laugh all creepy like that." `
`"You accept Beatrice's existence for now. `
`At least you accept her as the 19th person and a guest. `
`......But that's all, right? `
`...You don't accept that the 19th person, Beatrice, is a witch, right...?" `
`"Huh, of all the crazy things to say... `
`...Of course that's what I think. `
`{i:Witches couldn't possibly exist}. `
`The only possibility is that she's a human woman claiming to be a witch." `
`"...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi. `
`Hmmm...? `
`Isn't that odd, Battler? `
`...That's a Devil's Proof, isn't it? `
`...Of course witches don't exist? `
`But just because you've never met a witch, `
`that doesn't mean you've proven that witches don't exist, right...?" `
`"......... `
`......That's right. `
`...You're not wrong there. `
`I can't prove that witches don't exist. `
`......However, even if I can't prove it, I can claim it. `
`I claim that witches don't exist." `
`"Why...? `
`How can you claim that witches don't exist, even though you can't prove it...?" `
`"Because things like that don't exist." `
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi! `
`So, that's QED? `
`You've finished your proof, without any evidence or basis? `
`Now there's a typical case of the ignorant willfully ignoring the shallowness of their own knowledge. `
`A reckless suspension of thought. `
`Kihihihihihihihi...!" `
`"Then there's only one way to resolve this, Maria. `
`......The witch's side needs to show some proof themselves. `
`It's a Devil's Proof again. `
`...If you bring me a devil, we can end this right now." `
`"...In this case, we can just get this woman calling herself Beatrice `
`to display some wonderful, magnificent magic like the twinkling stars. `
`All she has to do is show us something {i:that's impossible for {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s} `
`, right?" `
`"...Come now, you two. `
`Please settle down..." `
`Kumasawa noticed that the atmosphere between them was getting worse and tried to calm them. `
`...It seemed as though Battler quickly realized that he wasn't acting like an adult. `
`But Maria's expression didn't loosen. `
`...As she laughed creepily, she kept staring at Battler... `
`"You quit it too, Maria. `
`...Let's get back in a good mood, okay?" `
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihi, kihihihihihihihihihihihihi." `
`"............" `
`"...If that's what you want, Beatrice will definitely show you. `
`{i:Something impossible for Humans}. `
`When she does, you'll believe too, okay? `
`You'll believe in Beatrice." `
`".........Sure. `
`...If she lets me have a look, I'll believe." `
`"It's a chess debate between the witch and you, Battler. `
`......If you get checkmated, you'll believe in the witch." `
`"Ooh, I like the way you put that. `
`...The witch shows her magic. `
`My king is put into check. `
`I quibble, saying it'd be possible to reproduce her feat using measures even a human could take, and my king escapes. `
`...Failing to do that would be checkmate, so that's a pretty good analogy." `
`"Battler, `
`...in chess, you and your opponent have pieces that move in the same way. `
`So you can predict your opponent's moves. `
`......But you know what? `
`What you aren't expecting...is that your opponent's pieces might be able to move in ways far stranger than yours. `
`You've simply assumed that, since witches must not exist, the movements of Beatrice's pieces will obviously be the same as your own." `
`".................." `
`"...But you know what? `
`......Sorry, Battler, but your chess partner isn't Human. `
`She's a witch. `
`...She can move her pieces in ways that Humans can't. `
`......Right now, your understanding is flawed. `
`...Battler, you like Aunt Kyrie's chessboard thinking, right?" `
`"......Yeah. `
`I like that style of thinking, where you stand in your opponent's shoes." `
`"And that's why you'll get stuck. `
`Even though your opponent is a witch, you won't accept it. `
`......So you can't understand the moves a witch might make, and your chessboard thinking won't work. `
`Your knowledge of your opponent is mistaken. `
`The very first premise of chessboard thinking is broken down." `
`"............Ah, `
`...so that's your game." `
`"{i:{ruby:sonata:You} cannot win in chess against a witch}...! `
`Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!" `
`"...I don't know what happened after that. `
`We servants were strictly ordered not to approach the dining room..." `
`"......I see. `
`So, Shannon, have you ever met this person called Beatrice before?" `
`"............ `
`...I don't know." `
`That was a slightly odd way to say it. `
`It didn't quite sound as if she was saying her memory was hazy. `
`"...For us servants, Beatrice-sama is a second master of this mansion. `
`...Some people say we've spread that rumor because of the Master's influence, `
`...but even when I'd just started working here, the story of Beatrice-sama was already being whispered of." `
`"I've heard about it before. `
`...If you don't show her respect, you'll get cursed, and at least one servant actually did meet with an accident, right?" `
`"Yes, `
`.........but it's true that some people believed more than others. `
`...I, umm, ...believe respect for that sort of thing shouldn't be forgotten, so I have never doubted that she exists. `
`......I vaguely believed that a... `
`umm...shadowy being called the Golden Witch existed." `
`"...And then that witch, whose existence was so shadowy and obscure, actually showed herself and entered openly through the entrance hall... Is that what happened?" `
`"......I don't know. `
`.........I don't know...anything." `
`"......... `
`...When you brought her dinner, did you talk about anything?" `
`"............... `
`...No, nothing." `
`"I see. `
`...Still, a witch that eats food somehow doesn't sound so realistic. `
`Maybe, after all, it's just someone who knows about the witch legend on this island, someone who's taking on Beatrice's name." `
`"......I think you've probably come to respect Beatrice and think of her as something like a guardian god of the mansion. `
`So when a person appeared actually going by that name, maybe you were a little disturbed." `
`"......... `
`......That's right. `
`I guess that must be the case." `
`George was slightly at a loss at what to do about Shannon's downcast appearance. `
`...Maybe not just Genji, `
`but even the young servants had been ruthlessly questioned as to whether they knew anything about this Beatrice person... `
`Thinking that, he tried to cheer her up somehow. `
`Surely, just like Maria and Jessica, `
`Shannon was unable to fully hide the agitation caused by the sudden visit of this person calling herself the Golden Witch. `
`He'd been so sure that was the case. `
`...But George probably had no way of looking into Shannon's heart. `
`Shannon was bitter and sad. `
`...The door to the Golden Land...would be opened. `
`...The witch had definitely told her that. `
`That meant...the demise of everything. `
`.........Even if she accepted the ring from George, `
`......they would never be married now. `
`No, in the first place... `
`...Did furniture like her...even have the right to be married? `
`Even if the witch hadn't come to signal their demise, ...wasn't their relationship fated to fail sooner or later? `
`Had she turned her gaze to focus solely on those fun days spent with George, ...while purposefully closing her eyes to the sad reality? `
`".........What's wrong? `
`...You really haven't looked well for a while now." `
`"George-san, `
`......what does it mean...to be engaged?" `
`"Huh?! `
`Ah, ...err! `
`It means making a promise to marry. `
`...But I think in that sense, it means the same thing as marriage. `
`......To be honest, I want to take you home as my wife right away. `
`...But right now, I'm in the middle of training, and I'm still a long way from having the capacity to create my own castle. `
`That's why I want to take you home with me with my head held high, only after I've become a full adult." `
`"I'm not talking about the distant future. `
`I just want you to wait a short three years. `
`...But that doesn't mean I want to lie about my feelings for another three years." `
`"So, ...I decided to give you an engagement ring. `
`...That might be a shameful reason as a man. `
`Maybe it's shameful to get engaged because I want you to wait, since I can't support my work and a wife at the same time yet. `
`...But I will definitely-" `
`"......Thank you very much. `
`...I understand that to you, George-san, an engagement ring means something different than one of many presents you'd give to a lover." `
`"O-Of course it's different. `
`An engagement ring isn't a simple accessory. `
`It's an oath between lovers, a noble promise left in the form of a ring." `
`"......*giggle* `
`...So, if we were to get married right away, it'd be completely meaningless, right?" `
`"Th-Then it wouldn't be an engagement ring. `
`I'd give it to you as a wedding ring. `
`...Either way, I'd still be giving you a ring." `
`"So it's a 'Sold' sign, like saying 'This woman is mine, nobody touch her'." `
`"Nn......no, umm, ......that's not what I...... `
`......*cough*." `
`George knew that he was weak by nature. `
`When he'd been captivated by Shannon and had sworn to become an excellent man, he had also sworn to throw away that weak part of himself. `
`...So, even if he had to be blunt about it, he chose to answer a little roughly. `
`...He was sure that doing so would bolster and reassure Shannon. `
`".........No, ...that may be true. `
`.........Sayo, `
`I'll make you my wife. `
`...I won't give you to anyone else. `
`I'll make you mine alone. `
`...So no one will lay a hand on you. `
`...That's what this ring is. `
`...Without a doubt." `
`"Thank you very much, George-san. `
`.........I'm truly...happy." `
`Then, George-san. `
`...If it was decided by fate that this engagement ring...that this promise could never be fulfilled, ...would you still give it to me...? `
`...Shannon tried to ask that, ...but she swallowed her words. `
`Because George had already spoken the answer. `
`...George had said it. `
`He had said that to him, an engagement ring was infinitely similar to a wedding ring. `
`Therefore, accepting George's ring had a significance far more sacred than a promise to marry. `
`"So, `
`...I'll stop calling this an engagement ring. `
`From now on, this isn't an engagement. `
`It's a wedding ring." `
`"I-Is that really okay...? `
`Is it okay to...umm, just proclaim that we're married without even God's blessing...?" `
`"Yeah. `
`It's enough to tell God, Father, and Mother about it afterwards. `
`We'll tell them all that we've been married. `
`.........No one will be able to undo it." `
`"......George-san..." `
`"I'm not saying this because of a momentary emotion. `
`I'm not just looking at how you are now. `
`......I'm looking at the you of tomorrow, of the next day. `
`...I'm even gazing at you as you'll be in old age, in the future, as I say this." `
`"...You're always talking about that, George-san. `
`...About how you want to enjoy your old age slowly, surrounded by healthy children and grandchildren." `
`"Yeah. `
`At that time, an older you will be beside me. `
`That is what I expect...no, what I foresee. `
`...Yes. `
`Because that day will surely come." `
`"...............Will it... `
`surely come? `
`{e:070:......Is it OK......for me to believe?}{e:100:"} `
`"Yes. `
`Surely. `
`Definitely. `
`...And this ring proves it without words." `
`"............Please, `
`......show me." `
`"Huh? `
`Ah, `
`ah, `
`ah, `
`.........h‐he‐here it is...!" `
`George, thinking he was being told to show her the ring, hurriedly took out the ring box. `
`...Even though he had practiced so much, he hadn't been able to do it cool. `
`But Shannon wasn't looking at that. `
`......In her straight and direct gaze were vague tears and a smile. `
`.........She focused her eyes on George's eyes...no, on something she could see beyond his eyes... `
`"......Show me... `
`......show me... `
`......that future." `
`"......Y-Yeah. `
`...I'll show you. `
`Surely. `
`...I promise it. `
`......And not just until old age. `
`...After we die too. `
`...Even when we become spirits, we'll always, always be together." `
`Shannon wiped away her tears and took the ring box. `
`Inside was a diamond ring worthy of blessing the two of them. `
`George said the line that he'd practiced over and over again inside his head. `
`"...I-I want you to put this ring on...whatever finger you like...and have that be your answer. `
`Umm, so, by tomorrow morning..." `
`"...*giggle*." `
`Shannon smiled, took the ring, `
`...and with a completely natural movement, put it on the ring finger of her left hand. `
`It really had looked...like such a natural, ordinary movement, `
`and for a while, George was stunned... `
`"This...is my answer, `
`George-san." `
`"Shannon... `
`no, `
`......Sayo........." `
`"......Even if we become spirits, `
`......we'll always... `
`......always... `
`be together, `
`......George-san." `
`There was no blessing from God, no pastor to witness, nothing. `
`But the two who were married...proclaimed it. `
`...Two souls were joined here today...... `
`".........Nee-san, .........you're a fool." `
`"...Is that so?" `
`"Even though you're furniture... `
`...Even though...you're furniture...!" `
`"I'm not furniture. `
`Not anymore." `
`"...Liar!! `
`Why are you fooling yourself?! `
`Even though you know you can never become human! `
`Even though you know you can't become human unless you go to the Golden Land!! `
`...Knowing that, why did you abandon the promise that would let you go there...?!!" `
`"Oh, right. `
`By accepting the ring, ...that promise with Beatrice-sama comes to nothing, doesn't it? `
`...*giggle* I'm sorry." `
`"......From now on, I, you, George-sama, the Master, and everyone else...are under the same conditions. `
`13 people will be sacrificed. `
`Only five people will be invited to the Golden Land. `
`...And you... `
`...rejected one of those places yourself..." `
`"That's odd. `
`...It looks like you're the one with regrets, Kanon-kun." `
`"You're the one with regrets, aren't you, Nee-san?! `
`You got engaged, right?! `
`Even though you knew it was a fate that would never be fulfilled!!" `
`"Yes. `
`I promised that we would always, always be together, for eternity. `
`...So you know what? `
`...In that instant, our eternity was completed. `
`Even if we become sacrifices, it's already completed. `
`So, it's okay." `
`"......Kanon, you're the one who actually has regrets. `
`...We're furniture, right? `
`We'll be freed no matter the result. `
`...So, it doesn't matter whether we go to Golden Land or not. `
`...And yet you're set on going there. `
`......You want to become human no matter what, right? `
`...Why?" `
`"Because I want to become human!! `
`I've had enough of being furniture!!" `
`"Why?" `
`"I...wanted to fall in love too...!!!" `
`Tears were coming from Kanon's eyes. `
`...And he howled. `
`"...I...liked Milady...!! `
`And after seeing Milady that day, I started liking her even more...! `
`And when I heard that Milady also liked me, I was really happy...!! `
`But I'm furniture, ...and I can't accept Milady's feelings!!" `
`"...You're wrong. `
`......We may be furniture. `
`We may be less than human. `
`...But that doesn't mean that we aren't qualified to love." `
`"I thought that...if these feelings wouldn't ever come to anything, I'd be better off not having them!! `
`I just decided that eventually, I'd disappear, and that it'd definitely hurt her. ......No, that's wrong!! `
`I was just frightened!! `
`I...was just afraid, thinking that any love that couldn't be eternal was best avoided!!" `
`"...Even though their lives last only a few weeks, cicadas fall in love and then vanish. `
`......But you'll never find a cicada that refused to fall in love simply because it'd end in a few weeks." `
`"Aaaaaaaaaaaaagggghhh!! `
`Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggghhh!!" `
`It seemed that Kanon was still muttering his regrets, but by now, it was all jumbled up with his sobs... `
`"...That witch is detestable...!! `
`...Why did she plant these feelings in me...?! `
`If only...if only she hadn't pulled that bizarre prank, I wouldn't have paid Milady any notice...!!!" `
`".........Beatrice-sama is detestable. `
`...To make you cry bitter tears, she played games with your fate. `
`......But I don't think things went as the witch expected. `
`...After all-" `
`Knowing love isn't a regret that ties you to life. `
`It is the destination we're supposed to reach in our journey through life... `
`Well now, Kanon. `
`That promise you worked so hard for has now come to nothing. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*! `
`Very well then. `
`With this, the conditions for all of the pieces are the same. `
`There are 18 pieces! 13 will be offered as sacrifices! `
`Who will the five survivors be? `
`......Or else... `
`Will someone destroy this ceremony? `
`Who?!! How?! `
`Fuhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`This isn't a chess problem. `
`It's a game on an equal footing. `
`I won't be cornering you one-sidedly. `
`You'll be able to frantically escape my advances and force a tie, an invalid match. `
`At any rate, I doubt you can manage more than repeating that over and over. `
`And it probably won't be that difficult for you. `
`However, this invalid match will continue forever...until it eventually wears down your mind and kills it. `
`That is when you'll accept your defeat and surrender to me!! `
`There's a reason I said it was a game on an equal footing. `
`...That's because rules for my loss have also been established. `
`There's nothing as boring as a game you can't lose, right? `
`As for how to defeat me... `
`That would be...the epitaph that stands as an offering to my portrait. `
`It's both the way to open the door to the Golden Land...and the key to destroying my ceremony. `
`I'll try to complete the ceremony in accordance with the epitaph. `
`You'll try to solve the riddle of the epitaph, destroy the ceremony and overthrow me...! `
`Solve the riddle hidden in the epitaph, and expose the location of the vast sum of gold I gave Kinzo!! `
`What result will this game show us?! `
`I'm expecting a good fight, okay? `
`Entertain me, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeer!! `
`".................." `
`".........I have no objections. `
`...Natsuhi and I acknowledge it." `
`"......Ggh... `
`...I can't believe it, ...and I don't want to, `
`...but this is...the truth, isn't it..." `
`"...Natsuhi, `
`choose your words more carefully. `
`......She's this family's most honored guest." `
`"......I-I also acknowledge it. `
`...Can't argue back." `
`"Yes. `
`...I acknowledge it. `
`......I have absolutely no complaints. `
`I can't believe you actually... `
`......You have my honest respect." `
`"Me too... `
`......Incredible. `
`I genuinely respect you. `
`...So I have to acknowledge it." `
`"I acknowledge it too... `
`......I still can't believe it. `
`...Still, ......what can I do? `
`{i:You've proven devils}! `
`It's your victory...!" `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...! `
`The Devil's Proof was a convenient excuse you liked using to handle unprovable matters, ...but now it's become your mortal enemy, has it not?" `
`"...Don't torture me, mighty witch. `
`......I've already acknowledged you. `
`I resign." `
`".................." `
`"...Kyrie, `
`do you still have objections...? `
`I must have everyone in agreement. `
`If you alone will not acknowledge my existence..." `
`As the witch laughed boldly, the siblings started getting frantic. `
`...They were afraid of displeasing the witch. `
`Kyrie lightly closed her eyes, ...and after keeping silent for a while, opened her mouth. `
`"...My apologies. `
`...I resign." `
`Only Kyrie had faced the witch with stern eyes until the end. `
`...However, this had only resulted in her refusing to accept the truth for a short time. `
`The truth...the being...that was before her eyes...couldn't be denied. `
`{i:Devils had already been proven}...! `
`"......I also...acknowledge it. `
`...You are Beatrice. `
`The Ushiromiya family alchemist. `
`...And a user of great magic. `
`......I must acknowledge the fact that you are a witch...!" `
