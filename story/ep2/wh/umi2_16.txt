`After Genji finished his late meal, he went out to do the nighttime rounds inside the mansion. `
`He'd eaten some reheated soup that Gohda had made, along with some random leftovers from the refrigerator. `
`Those were all things Gohda had made himself, and were, of course, delicious. `
`He had half-heartedly gone to ask Rosa and the others what they would do for dinner, but he'd been yelled at by a voice telling him that the canned food they had would be enough, and the door wasn't even opened for him. `
`...So, ironically, the servant Genji was able to eat a more delicious meal... `
`...But why was it that Genji wasn't afraid to do the rounds all by himself, `
`even though all of those crimes had been committed and many people had already met a brutal end? `
`...Judging by his appearance as he carried out his usual tasks without a trace of fear, as though everything was normal, `
`you might think all of the horrible events that day had been no more than a dream or an illusion. `
`Was he taking a philosophic view, or had he just accepted his fate? `
`Genji must have considered it a virtue that, when the fate that awaited him was unavoidable, `
`he carry out his duty systematically until the last moment. `
`The depths of his heart would probably remain hidden for all eternity, unless he spoke of them himself... `
`He had returned his master key to Rosa, so the places he could reach were extremely limited. `
`All he could do was walk around the hallways, checking to make sure all the windows were closed. `
`That probably made his rounds go a lot faster than usual. `
`"............ `
`...Hmm." `
`At the sound of a reserved knock, `
`Aunt Rosa, who had been falling into a doze, jumped and woke up, pointing the barrel of the gun at the door as she yelled. `
`"Who is it?!" `
`I was napping on a sofa...and that voice also brought me back to reality. `
`"...Rosa-sama, `
`it is I, Genji." `
`"Do you have some business? `
`Don't worry about opening the door. `
`Tell us from there." `
`"......Yes Ma'am. `
`In that case, forgive me for speaking in this fashion. `
`...I have found Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa's corpses." `
`"Wh-What did you say...?!!" `
`"......I see. `
`Very well, let's go and check them. `
`...Until I see the corpses, I won't believe anyone." `
`"........." `
`"...Uu-. `
`It's okay, Battler. `
`If you stay with me, it'll definitely be okay." `
`Maybe my face seemed to be darkened with anxiety. `
`...Maria grasped my hand with her small hand and spoke softly, trying to give me courage. `
`Since it was Aunt Rosa's job to ready the gun and stand guard, it fell to me to remove the barricade of sofas. `
`When I finished, I took a backwards glance at Aunt Rosa, who was pointing the barrel of the gun over my shoulder, and opened the door. `
`"Genji-san, where are their corpses...?" `
`"......In the courtyard. `
`I shall guide you." `
`"Battler-kun, wait! `
`Just in case, let's check the doors and windows of this room. `
`Wait a second." `
`Aunt Rosa called me to a halt to prevent me from going on ahead and began to carefully check the locks on each of the windows. `
`...But those locks had already been checked once. `
`...It felt kind of unpleasant, as though she suspected that I might've secretly unlocked them when she wasn't looking. `
`...No, maybe Aunt Rosa was right to be this cautious... `
`Though it was called a courtyard, it wasn't really a pretty place you could take a walk in, like the rose garden. `
`On the contrary, since it was surrounded by the mansion on all sides, `
`it made you feel a little uncomfortable, as though it was telling you that there would be no escape from this mansion no matter where you tried to run. `
`On the other hand, that meant that even though we could still hear the violent winds, the wind itself was blocked. `
`Genji-san held out an umbrella, but Aunt Rosa ignored him. `
`...She was probably hinting that the gun took two hands, and it would be dangerous if she took the umbrella. `
`We didn't need Genji-san pointing for us to notice. `
`Right in the center of the courtyard, ...we could see where Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa-san lay... `
`Aunt Rosa entered the courtyard without even opening an umbrella. `
`...So Genji and I also entered the courtyard without opening one. `
`Only Maria opened hers. `
`".........Maria, `
`...is this...you know what?" `
`"...Uu-. `
`...It's the seventh and the eighth twilights." `
`"...I-I see. `
`Certainly, just as Genji-san and the others said, there are horrible wounds on their necks. `
`...The cuts are quite sharp. `
`Almost as though they were sliced with a katana or something..." `
`Those gaping wounds on their necks definitely made me want to avert my eyes, `
`but after seeing that Halloween party in the chapel, even though they looked horrible, they were no longer enough to make me feel sick. `
`More importantly, our gazes fell to their legs. `
`To Doctor Nanjo's knee. `
`To Kumasawa-san's ankle. `
`...Driven into each of them was something like a knife or a stake with a demonic design. `
`...They must have been the same as the thing that had pierced Jessica's back. `
`"...What is this? `
`...It's just like what happened to Jessica-chan. `
`Is this supposed to be some kind of occult ceremony, I wonder?" `
`"......I do not know. `
`The last time I saw their bodies, there was nothing like these. `
`Maybe it was done after they were carried out of the servant room." `
`The one stuck into Doctor Nanjo's knee was still standing erect, `
`but the one that had been thrust into Kumasawa-san's ankle might have been a little shallower. `
`It had come out and fallen over. `
`So, by looking at the one that had fallen over, for the first time, I realized that it wasn't a knife, `
`but something like a stake. `
`Its full length was probably about 30 centimeters. `
`It was probably made out of bronze or iron or something of the sort. `
`Even without touching it, I could tell it had some weight to it. `
`It was composed of a grip and a cone-shaped part, and it was obviously made to be a piercing weapon. `
`Maybe it was like a miniature version of those lances western knights used on horseback. `
`The spiral-shaped ditches in it made it also look like a small drill. `
`...However, the grip had an occult design modeled off a demon or something, `
`so instead of a weapon used in war, `
`it felt like something that would be used in a ceremony to offer up living sacrifices. `
`"...There's no mistake. `
`...They're meant to be...sacrifices." `
`"...On the seventh twilight, gouge the knee and kill. `
`On the eighth twilight, gouge the leg and kill." `
`"Wait a sec. `
`That means they've left out the fourth, fifth, and sixth twilights. `
`...C-Could it be..." `
`Of course. `
`Why is Genji-san alone?! `
`If something like this has happened, why aren't George-aniki, Gohda-san, and Shannon-chan here?! `
`Why was Genji-san alone?! `
`"What's going on? `
`Where did George-kun and the other two go?!" `
`"......They said they wanted to search for something in Madam Natsuhi's room, and they left. `
`They have not returned yet." `
`"What did you say...? `
`Umm, you say they left, but when was that?!" `
`"Two or three hours ago, I believe." `
`"N-No way...!! `
`Why didn't you tell us something that...wait, no, ...why didn't you think that was suspicious?!" `
`"...There must be at least one servant on standby at all times. `
`It was my duty to wait for orders until they returned." `
`Was Genji-san really this much of a robot?! `
`This is bad, this is bad, it's really bad...!! `
`Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa-san were {i:killed like this}, which means that three people have already been killed...!! `
`We ran towards Aunt Natsuhi's room. `
`......With a touch of anxiety, and just as much resignation. `
`Before we even saw the inside of Aunt Natsuhi's room, `
`...we were forced to resign ourselves to a certain fact. `
`On that door was a bizarre... `
`scribble... `
`no, filth...? `
`Anyway, the room wasn't in an ordinary state, and without even opening the door, we could imagine what we'd find inside. `
`On the face of the door......how should I say it? `
`...Handprints, done heavily with the same red paint as the magic circles from before, `
`...had banged on the door, scratched at it, dirtied it. `
`...It looked like the aftermath of a kindergartner playing in the mud. `
`I didn't know what it could mean. `
`...The bright-red paint that had been slathered on was dripping down, and even though no one said it, it made us think of blood. `
`"...G-Genji-san, please open it." `
`Aunt Rosa held her gun up high and ordered Genji-san to open the door. `
`Genji-san approached it without seeming particularly troubled by that stuff on it...and turned the knob, `
`but immediately turned around, shaking his head. `
`It was locked. `
`At that moment, there was only one person in this mansion who could lock and unlock doors at will, Aunt Rosa. `
`This time, Genji-san asked Aunt Rosa to unlock the door, instead of the other way around. `
`After frowning slightly for a second, Aunt Rosa handed me a master key and told me to open the door. `
`"...Battler-kun, would you open it for me with this?" `
`"Just trusting Genji-san with something like that wouldn't..." `
`Aunt Rosa glared at me intensely. `
`...Getting into a fight here would only make the mood turn even more sour. `
`Without talking back any more, I approached that creepy door and tried the knob. `
`...It didn't open. `
`It was definitely the resistance of the lock. `
`I stuck the master key into the keyhole. `
`*clunk* `
`There was a slight resistance. `
`Aunt Rosa told me to be on my guard, and I opened the door without really guarding myself in any way. `
`And then, ......there was a scene laid out before us that didn't betray my expectations at all. `
`"............! `
`H-Horrible..." `
`"........." `
`"As I thought, ...it's a reproduction of the fourth, fifth, and sixth twilights." `
`"......Uu-." `
`The inside of the room looked as though a robber had just broken in. `
`Drawers had been flung open, pulled out, and had their contents thrown about all over the place, `
`leaving the room so cluttered you'd never believe it belonged to the methodical Aunt Natsuhi. `
`But the very first thing that caught our eyes... `
`...was Gohda-san's corpse lying facedown right in front of the door... `
`Right in the center of his chest, almost as though it had been stuck there to finish off a vampire, was one of those demon stakes from before. `
`...Exactly how far could it have reached after being stuck that deeply into his chest? `
`...Just imagining it would make anyone's chest hurt. `
`"...Wasn't gouging the chest...the fifth twilight?" `
`"......Uu-." `
`Maria grabbed my hand. `
`...Her expression looked just like normal, `
`...but maybe she really was afraid of the aura in this room where three corpses lay. `
`And, along the wall farthest into the room, George-aniki lay dead. `
`...This time, one of those stakes had been rammed right into the center of his stomach. `
`...Wasn't gouging the stomach...the sixth twilight? `
`Shannon-chan's corpse was face down in front of the dresser, lying in a sea of blood. `
`Had she seen her own face at the end...in that horribly broken mirror stained with blood? `
`...Because she was lying that way, I couldn't see her face, but I could guess even without seeing it. `
`Nearby, in the sea of blood she lay in, a demon's stake had fallen... `
`...Only the fourth twilight was left. `
`Gouge the head and kill... `
`Maybe my heart was totally worn out and dead... `
`Even though I knew it was wrong, ...I lifted her head...and checked. `
`...And, I confirmed that my guess had been right on the mark. `
`There was a gaping hole in Shannon-chan's head, and the insides were dripping out. `
`Not only that, ...but you could even see...inside her. `
`After seeing that, I finally realized I was doing something wrong. `
`I immediately averted my eyes, but by now, it was probably pointless. `
`"Hey, Battler-kun!! `
`You mustn't touch anything until the police come!! `
`What do you think you're doing, touching it?! `
`What will you do if our precious evidence on the scene gets disturbed?!!" `
`Aunt Rosa got violently mad at me and even tugged at the back of my collar. `
`I tottered limply and fell on my butt, ...gazing dimly up at the ceiling... `
`"...Maria." `
`"Uu-...?" `
`"...With this, even the eighth twilight is over. `
`...What was the ninth twilight again?" `
`"......... `
`...On the ninth twilight, the witch shall revive, and none shall be left alive." `
`"I see. `
`...After this, the Golden Witch Beatrice will be revived. `
`...What then? `
`...On the final tenth twilight?" `
`"...On the tenth twilight, at journey's end, you shall attain to the power of the Golden Land's treasures, once and for the last time. `
`...Very soon, the door to the Golden Land will be opened. `
`...Very soon." `
`"......The witch shall be revived and none shall be left alive, huh? `
`......We're gonna die now? `
`Or does this mean the ceremony of sacrifices is over, ...and that now, at journey's end, we'll reach the Golden Land...?" `
`"............" `
`"......Our journey, yeah right. `
`......We've spent the whole day trying to find the culprit, racking our brains as we tried to break out of this situation, `
`...and we haven't gotten anywhere. `
`It's like they say, thinking stupid is no better than sleeping." `
`"That's right, we've spent the whole day burning ourselves up with hatred and paranoia. `
`...We were so sure we could only trust the dead... `
`...that we came all the way here just to confirm these three deaths with our own eyes... `
`...If we're like this, `
`...why... `
`...should we be able to make it to the Golden Land...?" `
`That's right, ...if we couldn't resolve any of our problems anyway, it would've been so much better if we'd locked ourselves up the whole time without thinking at all. `
`Grandfather's the wisest of us. `
`He's been shut up in his room since yesterday, without any contact with anyone. `
`...That was the right decision. `
`Grandfather was the most correct of us all... `
`"...It's okay, Battler. `
`...If you're with me, you'll be okay. `
`......The witch is very fickle, and she's a terrifying being who might kill humans partly for fun sometimes." `
`"...However, if you're with me, you'll be okay. `
`So don't be afraid." `
`"......Thank you. `
`...Even if you're just saying it to console me, I'm glad." `
`After Aunt Rosa finished investigating their corpses, she announced that she'd seal this room again, `
`chased the rest of us out, stole back the master key she'd lent me, and locked the door again. `
`Apparently, George-aniki had been holding the key to Aunt Natsuhi's room. `
`She also collected that. `
`......Wait a sec. `
`She's got all of the master keys on her person. `
`If Natsuhi's own key was locked up inside this room, `
`...doesn't that make it another closed room? `
`So what, is this the fourth closed room...? `
`Now that the suspicion surrounding those three had been cleared, ...we returned to the parlor once more. `
`I don't have a clue what's going on anymore. `
`...If only the dead are innocent, and everyone alive is a wolf, `
`...that leaves only me, Aunt Rosa, Maria, and Genji-san. `
`...And, besides us, there's only Grandfather and that 19th person, the guest we've seen no trace of, Beatrice. `
`13 people have died, and six are left. `
`...How would a wolves and sheep puzzle with only six people end...? `
`Even though a puzzle that started with 19 people has been reduced to six, `
`...I can't think of an answer... `
`We returned to the parlor. `
`...I was a bit worried that, while we were gone, `
`a creepy magic circle or something might've been drawn on the parlor door, `
`but thankfully, we didn't find anything like that... `
`"Thank you, Genji-san. `
`This is far enough. `
`Please rest for the day." `
`"...Certainly. `
`...Then, please excuse me." `
`"H-Hey, Aunt Rosa, `
`...are you saying you'll leave Genji-san all alone in a situation like this...?" `
`"...That's right. `
`I do think it's quite dangerous. `
`...But in that case, why is he safe? `
`After those three headed to Natsuhi nee-san's room, he was alone the whole time. `
`And yet he's safe." `
`"...It's a wolves and sheep puzzle. `
`Why would a sheep be safe if it was all alone, and therefore in its weakest possible position?" `
`"...P-Probably because, by coincidence, there weren't any wolves around..." `
`"Wrong. `
`It's because it wasn't a sheep." `
`"Are you saying Genji-san's...a wolf...?" `
`"He said he was alone in the kitchen, but that's impossible to prove. `
`The only ones who could have carried Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa-san's corpses, who could have killed George and the rest, ...were him and Beatrice, right?" `
`"W-Wait, with that argument, anyone-" `
`"...Battler-sama, `
`thank you for your concern." `
`"...I believe trust is won not with a hundred excuses, but with simple faithfulness. `
`...Even if I am not able to gain your trust, I wish to be faithful until the end." `
`"............Genji-san..." `
`"...Then we're decided. `
`If you truly are innocent, the police will prove that for us when they come tomorrow. `
`So, until then, we cannot remove you from suspicion." `
`"......After your long years of service, I find it truly painful to treat you so poorly. `
`...But please understand about tonight. `
`...And, when tomorrow comes, please let us make up again." `
`Genji-san gave his head a small shake. `
`"...Today and tomorrow, `
`I will continue to be a servant of the Ushiromiya family. `
`...If you need anything, please say so at any time. `
`Then, if you will excuse me." `
`After hearing all that, there was nothing left to say. `
`Genji-san bowed deeply and left down the hall... `
`Then, we entered the room. `
`...Even though Aunt Rosa still held all of the master keys herself, she thoroughly checked the inside of the parlor again. `
`She opened the curtains and checked again to make sure the windows were locked. `
`As I watched...how should I say it, I felt like it didn't really matter anymore. `
`If I said anything careless, it would turn into another fight. `
`For a while, I gazed at her from the corridor, figured I'd waited just about long enough, and entered the parlor behind her. `
`...If she doesn't trust anyone but the dead, why doesn't she just go around killing everyone with the gun she's got in her hand? `
`And then, in the end, she'll realize that she herself is the wolf. `
`...Then she can just blast through the head of the final wolf and close the curtain on this insane murder drama... `
`As I thought that bitterly, I returned to the sofa where I'd been encamped before, `
`rudely resting both of my feet on the table... `
`...When I tried to do that, I found something there and stopped moving my feet. `
`"............ `
`......What is...this...?" `
`Right there, almost as though it had been addressed to me, ...was a Western envelope. `
`It was that envelope from before, with the seal of the One-Winged Eagle. `
`...And it was unopened. `
`...W- `
`Wait wait wait wait... `
`...What is...this......? `
`Who put it in a place like this, and when...? `
`Until I went with everyone to check the corpses, I was sitting here the whole time. `
`And there wasn't anything there then. `
`...And when I returned, `
`it was... `
`here. `
`"...It's okay. `
`Everything's still locked up securely. `
`This room is safe." `
`I heard Rosa muttering that... `
`...Wait wait wait wait. `
`...Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait. `
`We made sure this room was safe when we left it. `
`We checked that the windows were all perfectly locked. `
`...Then we locked it up, came back, and the windows were still locked. `
`...Then...wait, who put this letter here, and how...? `
`I opened the letter. `
`Two pieces of stationary came out. `
`The first page...had a magic circle drawn on it with something like blood. `
`If I asked Maria, she'd probably know what it meant. `
`And there was writing on the other page. `
`{e:070:'Have you made progress in solving the epitaph? `
`In just a short while, your time will be up in a flash. `
`The ninth twilight will begin quite soon.'} `
`...There was no mistake. `
`...It was a letter...from Beatrice... `
`"...Uu-? `
`...Battler, `
`...what is that?" `
`"Ah, ...aaah, `
`when we came here just now, `
`...i-it was sitting right here." `
`"What happened, Maria? `
`......Huh?! `
`Battler-kun, that letter?!" `
`"W-Wait, err! `
`It was sitting right here. `
`Why?! `
`Even though we checked to make sure this room was locked!! `
`Why?! `
`Why?!!" `
`"............... `
`...Maria, come here." `
`Aunt Rosa closed her eyes just a little, and after thinking silently for a moment, told Maria to come. `
`Maria obeyed her mother's words. `
`As she did, something unbelievable happened. `
`Aunt Rosa pointed the barrel of that gun at me... `
`"Battler-kun, I've concluded that you are a wolf." `
`"Wh......Why?!?!" `
`"When I came into the room just now, I saw that there was nothing at all on the table. `
`...And I know that Maria did not approach that table. `
`...We're talking about a short stretch of time. `
`But the only one who claims to have approached the table and found the letter...is you." `
`"How can you... `
`...wait, th-that's all screwed up!! `
`Why would I put something like this here?! `
`Wait, wait, I just found something suspicious and reported it, right?! `
`Why are you suspecting me?!" `
`"Because only you could've set that letter there!! `
`That's right, this is all a charade!! `
`You pulled an envelope from your pocket, and then acted as though you'd just found it. `
`To create the illusion that the witch entered a closed room, set down a letter, and left!!" `
`"......Dumbass, `
`...a-are you thinking like that again...? `
`Are you going to suspect me... `
`...because of something like that?! `
`Cut it out!! `
`My dad and everyone else were killed!! `
`Why would I take part in the culprit's scheme?!!" `
`"True. `
`Even if you were offered a large sum of money, I don't want to believe in the existence of the sort of demon who could sell out their own parents." `
`"Then again, ...maybe such a demon does exist. `
`No, that's a bad way to say it. `
`...What if you didn't view Rudolf nii-san and Kyrie-san as your parents?" `
`"...Wh-Whaaat?!?! `
`Think about what you're saying!! `
`Dad is Dad, right?! `
`Of course, I'm not related to Kyrie-san by blood, but she's like a big sister to me!! `
`No way in hell I'll let a comment like that slide, you bastard!!" `
`"Uu-uu-uu-!! `
`Stoooop iiit!! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!!" `
`"Stop saying uu-uu-!! `
`...I'm sorry, that was a bad way to put it. `
`True, Ushiromiya Battler-kun may be Rudolf nii-san's child!" `
`"...But are you really that Battler-kun?!" `
`"What the hell are you talking about?!! `
`If I'm not Battler, who else do I look like?!" `
`"All of us, including Rudolf nii-san, are seeing you for the first time in six years. `
`No one can prove that you really are Ushiromiya Battler, right?!" `
`"Maybe you aren't Battler, but someone who's snuck in, making a skillful bid to steal the wealth of the Ushiromiya family!! `
`Can you clearly prove that you're Ushiromiya Battler?! `
`Right here, right now?!!!" `
`"Cut it out, dammit!! `
`I'm me! `
`Ushiromiya Battler!! `
`If we're gonna suspect even things like that, are you really Ushiromiya Rosa?! `
`I'm myself, no one else!! `
`Yeah, that's right, it's just as you say, you can't trust anyone but corpses and yourself!!! `
`If you're gonna go that far, let me make an objection! `
`George-aniki and the others were found dead, and Aunt Natsuhi's room was locked! `
`George-aniki had the key to that room, right?! `
`And by now, the only one with a master key is you, Aunt Rosa, right?! `
`Aren't you the only one who could've unlocked that room?!?!" `
`"My theory goes like this. `
`You're in contact with the real culprit, `
`and while I wasn't looking, you lent them one of the five master keys!!" `
`"I didn't do something like that!! `
`See, there are five of them here, right?!" `
`"As if that matters!! `
`You could've had them set it in a pre-arranged spot and collected it, right?!! `
`And weren't you the one who doubted whether there really were five master keys?!" `
`"So, how do you suggest that someone other than yourself placed that letter there?!! `
`{i:Until you find proof someone else did it}, you're a wolf!!" `
`"Shut uuuuuup!! `
`Then why don't you show me some proof? `
`How do you claim the culprit killed George-aniki and the rest in that closed room?! `
`How did they lock it?!!" `
`"That's exactly right! `
`{p:1:Natsuhi's room was exactly the same, just like usual}! `
`{p:1:The door and the windows were locked from the inside}." `
`"{p:1:There were no frauds or tricks, no means of secret passage nor places in which to hide}! `
`{p:1:Natsuhi's own key was in George's pocket, and locked inside the room}. `
`{p:1:That leaves only the five master keys, and "Rosa" was holding all of them}!" `
`"{p:1:And while I'm at it, the parlor is the same}. `
`{p:1:The key to the parlor itself is sealed away in the servant room}. `
`{p:1:So unlocking it with anything but a master key is impossible}! {p:1:The locked‐room definition of the room is the same as always} `" `
`"Come on, now there's only one suspeeeeect, `
`or are you still playing innocent, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer?!" `
`"Shut uuuuuuup!! `
`You shut up tooooooooooooooooooooo!!!" `
`"You're the one who should shut up! How do you claim the letter was placed here by anyone other than you?! `
`Unless you can prove such a thing happened, you're a wolf!!" `
`"If we can suspect me, then we can suspect you too, so try showing me some proof yourself, `
`and anyway, weren't you the first person to enter this room and start checking the windows, Aunt Rosa?!" `
`"Then, you guessed that I'd go back to where I'd been sitting and secretly put the letter there. `
`It's possible for us to suspect that this is a trap of yours, right?!" `
`"Why would I use a trap like that?!! `
`If I was a wolf, I'd shoot you with this gun without question!!" `
`"That proves nothing!! `
`Maybe you chose the roundabout way of setting a clever trap because you couldn't commit murder in front of Maria!!" `
`"All the master keys are in your hands! `
`So what happened, both here and in the last room, was all your doing, right?!! `
`If you think you can talk your way out of this, then let's hear your excuses!!" `
`"That's right, you've been suspicious from the start, Aunt Rosa! `
`Why is it that even though six adults in the family conference were killed, you were the only exception? `
`Why were you the only one not in that chapel?!" `
`"There can only be one reason. You invited Dad and the rest there and killed them!! `
`Damn it, damn it, `
`that explains everything, doesn't it, don't fuck with me don't fuck with me, `
`stop saying things that don't make seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeense!!" `
`"Uuuuu----!! `
`Stoooooop iiiiiiiiit!! `
`You mustn't fiiiight!! `
`Mama too, Battler too, stop iiiiiiiiiiit, stop iiiiiiiiiiiiit!!! `
`It's no one's fault! `
`It's not Battler's or Mama's fault!! `
`The witch did all of this! `
`It was done with magic!! `
`It's no one's faaaaaaaaaault!! `
`Uu-uuuu---!!" `
`Maria thrust herself in between Aunt Rosa and me as the blood started rising to our heads. `
`I was taken aback by Maria's crying voice and returned to my senses. `
`...I had acted shamefully just now. `
`My eyes filled with tears. `
`"......That's right... `
`......It's all... `
`...the witch's fault, isn't it...?!! `
`All this about keys and tricks and alibis... `
`all of it, all of it was stupid!! `
`Even though it's the work of the witch, we weren't even able to trust each other as humans...!! `
`Right, Aunt Rosa? From the beginning, there wasn't a Human culprit, it was all the work of the witch." `
`"So there's no way you're the culprit, `
`and there's no way Maria, Genji-san or I am either!! `
`Why has it come to this?!! `
`Why am I screaming at Aunt Rosa...who I loved?! `
`Why am I having this fight... `
`with the kind aunt I loved so much?!" `
`"Why, why does everyone have to suspect each other?!?! `
`I'm not gonna suspect my aunt, I'm not gonna suspect anyone, `
`it's all the work of the witch, it's all the work of Beatrice, `
`it's all...all a crime that Beatrice committed with magic!!" `
`"Beatriiiiiiiice, please, show yourself here, `
`and confess to us that you did everything, `
`I'm sorry already, I'm sorry we've been suspecting each other like this!!" `
`"So forgive us, `
`release us, `
`release us from this hell of suspecting each other until we see each other die!! `
`Give me my kind relatives and cousins back!! `
`I hate it, I hate it, I hate it all!! `
`You definitely exist, it's your victory!!" `
`"Show yourself, ooooooooooooooooooohhh, Beatriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice! `
`Beatriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiceeeeeeeeee!!!" `
`"......Am I......still...alive?" `
`Apparently, some time ago, Kinzo had fallen into a doze. `
`He searched for his spectacles and looked at the clock. `
`...It was 10:00 P.M. `
`"...That person's ceremony...let's see, how far has it progressed? `
`......It must have come quite far by this time." `
`Kinzo lifted his heavy body from the chair...and approached the portrait of the witch that he had gazed at every day. `
`"......Beatrice, `
`very soon, ...I will have a chance to be reunited with your smile. `
`......I care not if I die! `
`If I can just see your smile one more time, I will not regret this life! `
`So, `
`...for heaven's sake, let me... `
`meet with you one more tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiime... `
`Then, let me swear my love to you, let me apologize for my crimes, uuuoooooooooooohh... `
`"......But I won't let you escape!! `
`You are mine!! `
`From your hair to your toenails, to the dirt under your toenails, you are mine!! `
`Every fragment of your flesh is mine, even the broth of your corpse is mine!! `
`I won't let you escape, this time you won't slip from my hands!! `
`I'll make you mine for all eternity!!! `
`I will never let you escape a second time, `
`I will never let you escape a second time!!" `
`Kinzo howled in rage, then suddenly fell to his knees...as he shook and scraped at the wall... `
`...In an instant, he had started sobbing. `
`"............uuuuuu, hic..., `
`That's wrong, `
`I didn't want to say something like thiiiiis, Beatriiiiiiiiice... `
`Please, `
`...let me see you one more time... `
`Even if you only let me apologize... `
`Aaaaaaahh, Beatriiiiiiiiiice, `
`...hic, ...hic...! Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagggggghhh...!!" `
`"You are beloved, yearned for...! I was mistaken...! `
`If you would just smile, I wouldn't need anything else... `
`I made a mistake, I made a mistake back then, `
`...I did something that cannot be taken back...!" `
`"In atonement, I have offered the whole remainder of my life...!! `
`In order to apologize to you, in order to atone for my sins, `
`......I offered... `
`everything...... `
`...Please, even if it must happen as I die... `
`......At least... `
`...let me... `
`apologize... `
`just once, `
`Beatriiiiiiiiice... `
`Aaaaagghh, hic, aaaaaaaah, aaaaaaaagggghghhh!" `
`...As Kinzo shook and cried, a butterfly appeared out of nowhere behind his small back like a flake of gold leaf...and softly descended... `
`...You fool, Kinzo. `
`Did you think any woman out there would fall for a man's tears......? `
`Well, ...even if it wouldn't make a Human woman fall for you, ...it might do the trick for a woman who is not Human. `
`Kinzo, `
`do you remember...? `
`That game of chess you played with me, which is still ongoing...? `
`Kinzo, as though he had suddenly remembered something, approached the chess set. `
`It was as it had been during the game he'd played with Nanjo until yesterday. `
`...After knocking all the pieces off the chessboard, he began to line them up again one by one. `
`...It was a setup for an ongoing game. `
`"......That's right. Like this. `
`......I advanced my queen. `
`...That was quite a spectacular move. `
`Perhaps it was a little too intense for you. `
`......I worried whether you'd abandon your piece or not, `
`...worried for so long......" `
`Kinzo waited, with the opposite seat empty. `
`...Surely, very soon, his opponent would appear there, `
`...and he would be able to restart this game again... `
`...You fool, Kinzo. `
`You want to apologize? `
`You want to see my face again? `
`You want to make my smile an eternal thing? `
`Why can't you say a much, much simpler word? `
`Even though that is the sole element of this world......? `
`At that time, Kinzo muttered. `
`...Was it a prayer? `
`An entreaty? `
`......It was probably best to just call it muttering. `
`"...I......love you, `
`...Beatrice......" `
`They were pure words, like something an innocent child would say, without any evil intent... `
`...You really are a fool, Kinzo. `
`If you ever have the chance to do your life over again... `
`Know that those words will never cause a woman to fall for you. `
`That's right, ...not unless a miracle happens. `
`That's what makes this...... `
`At that moment, `
`......Kinzo definitely heard a small knock, one with a tempo that differed from those of the servants...... `
`"......Who is it?" `
`The woman beyond the door...didn't answer. `
`"...I'm asking who you are!! `
`Will you not answer?!!" `
`The woman beyond the door... `
`...didn't answer. `
`"Could it be... `
`...oooooh, `
`...could it be... `
`...B- `
`Beatrice? `
`......Beatrice, `
`......Beatriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice!!" `
`The woman beyond the door...answered. `
`On the ninth twilight, the witch shall revive, and none shall be left alive. `
