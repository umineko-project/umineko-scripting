`"Well then, `
`...did you find that `
`game enjoyable?" `
`"...A game that one-sided goes beyond being riveting. It's boring." `
`"*cackle*cackle* My, my, but you're as harsh as always. `
`...Considering how proud I was to have created a development so `
`impactful that it might satisfy even the boredom-hating Lady Bernkastel, this response is quite harsh." `
`"...Well, I'll admit it was impactful. `
`...However, it was horrible as a fair game. `
`Unless you make the conditions a bit more even-" `
`"...Are you saying there's no way to win? `
`Not even for Lady Bernkastel? `
`...*cackle*cackle*." `
`".........I wonder what you mean by that, Beato." `
`"There's no need to try and fool me. `
`I already know. `
`...That {i:you're no bystander}." `
`"............" `
`"Were you planning on hiding it? `
`You're an outrageous person to come into someone else's territory from such a great distance to work against them. `
`You came to watch from the sidelines, and probably to push strongly for my defeat. `
`I've guessed right, haven't I...?" `
`"......... `
`And if so?" `
`"...*cackle*cackle*! `
`Truly amusing! `
`That I should be granted a chance to fight against Lady Bernkastel, the strongest of witches who defeated Lady Lambdadelta, is truly a pleasure!!" `
`"...Yes. `
`I'm also pleased. `
`I came all this way because I really wanted to see you, brimming with confidence, fall apart and lose." `
`"What an honest person. `
`*cackle*cackle*!! `
`Even so, it would be a shame if the contest between me and the great Lady Bernkastel `
`was resolved without at least one observer." `
`"......... `
`...You called her here, didn't you. `
`That kid." `
`"Hohohohohoh! `
`I found you, I've finally found you, Bernkastel!!" `
`"......How are you, Lambda? `
`Looks like you've got lots of spare time too. `
`I wonder if it's fate that the pair who hates boredom should run into each other again..." `
`"Stupid kid. `
`Can't you see you only won against me because of a little luck and a problem of compatibility? `
`After that, you became such a brag, and now you're even picking a fight with Beatrice? Shouldn't you learn your place?" `
`"*giggle* Beatrice is strong. `
`And she's even more brutal than I am. `
`Just a bit!" `
`"And by the way, don't go shortening people's names without their permission!" `
`"......You're dumb too, Beato. `
`If this kid's in your game, she'll make a mess of everything." `
`"I certainly didn't just bring Lady Lambdadelta here to watch from the sidelines. `
`After informing me that you were betting against me, she said that she would bet against you." `
`"............You're still holding a grudge, aren't you." `
`"Hohohohoh!! `
`Because I'm the strongest witch in the universe. `
`But I lost to you, which means I'm not the strongest! `
`So any enemy of yours is my ally!!" `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`And there you have it. `
`With the great Lady Bernkastel as our opponent, this may not even count as a handicap, but it should make for good entertainment." `
`"......Do as you like. `
`...Now that I've been exposed, allow me to get serious." `
`"That would be well. `
`"Going easy" has never been written in my dictionary. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*! `
`Lady Lambdadelta, let us enjoy our precious time together." `
`"Yeah, I'll be counting on you, Lady Beatrice! `
`I've been betrayed pretty bad by her too. `
`Until the two of us smash her up and pay her back double, I won't be able to rest!!" `
`"......I'll be counting on you, Lambda. `
`And you, Beato. `
`...No matter what we fight over, this will be a very significant battle for us all." `
`"That's right. `
`Of course, I don't plan on losing, but we've got a goal beyond who wins and who loses." `
`"After all, we hate boredom." `
`The three witches giggled, cackled, and guffawed. `
`"...That's right. `
`I should thank you, Beato. `
`It looks like I'll finally be able to escape my boredom. `
`Do your best to entertain me. `
`Along with Lambdadelta." `
`"Leave it to me. `
`*cackle*cackle*...!!" `
`"If we're decided, Beato, then let's start a strategy meeting right now! `
`I know all of this girl's weak points, and I'll teach you all of them!" `
`"And yet, Lady Lambdadelta, you were defeated by her, *cackle*cackle*...!" `
`"Urrrrrrrrgggh, I won't tell you, I won't tell you! `
`Tsun!" `
`"*cackle*cackle* Hahhahahahahahaha! `
`...She's never boring, that Lady Lambdadelta." `
`"......Isn't she? `
`Take care of her. `
`She gets lonely easily." `
`"I see. `
`So she's one of "those" that are popular these days. `
`*cackle* As expected from Lady Lambdadelta. `
`Quite cutting edge. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*." `
`"Go already. `
`That kid's waiting for you to chase after her." `
`"...Then, if you'll excuse me. `
`See you next game. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!" `
`...I'm sorry. `
`That troublesome one came, but don't mind it. `
`More importantly, `
`......things sure got ugly. `
`I thought I experienced a very tragic end in Lambda's game, `
`......but this one is...exceptionally horrible. `
`...I can't say I don't understand why you're hugging your knees and closing up your heart. `
`If you meet a fate like that a few more times, `
`it'll take a lot less than a hundred years to kill your heart. `
`...Beato saw through me, so I'll confess. `
`You are now just like I was in the past, when I was imprisoned inside Lambda's world. `
`Shut inside a labyrinth of cruel fate, tormented by a witch, in a manner of speaking. `
`...I am a witch who was born from there. `
`...So maybe I'm like an older sister to you. `
`So I decided that I'd lend you my power. `
`However, `
`......even compared to my fate, `
`...yours is...truly brutal. `
`Not only do I sympathize with you, I'm almost brought to tears by your tragic fate. `
`But please, don't lose heart. `
`Please don't submit to Beato, no matter what. `
`Certainly, that child's game is quite unfair. `
`I've only been allowed a glimpse of the game board, `
`but the unfair and clever devices set up on the stage are so disgusting...that I imagine they far surpass those on Lambdadelta's game board. `
`And what's even more frightening...is that when that kid moves a piece, she doesn't always make the best possible move. `
`This is where she's very different from Lambda. `
`Lambda always uses an overpowering number of pieces to make the best possible move in order to win. `
`But Beato sometimes intentionally goes easy on her opponent when she moves her pieces. `
`Since, when we're in trouble, we try to seek out our opponent's strategy by looking at their moves, `
`this creates a very formidable amount of noise in our information. `
`That might cause a troublesome amount of disorder. `
`...However, as in chess, `
`though a player might be able to create some noise for their opponent with a useless move, they'll still miss out on the more valuable move they avoided. `
`In other words, it's not like your opportunities to take advantage of this are zero. `
`Although you may not be able to believe it, that analogy holds true for this game as well. `
`...Even though those developments looked so overpowering, `
`...there actually was a weak point. `
`A weak point that almost looks like she wanted you to take advantage of it. `
`...Though, I don't know if it's a trap or if she's testing us. `
`Anyway, don't surrender. `
`Don't stop thinking. `
`Don't deny any possibility. `
`As long as you continue to hold the will to fight, Beato will not win. `
`What's the most important element in defense during a witch's battle? `
`Rather than trying to win, try not to lose. `
`...If accepting her means your defeat, then you definitely mustn't accept her. `
`...Making you accept witches. `
`There is no longer any doubt that this is one of Beatrice's victory conditions. `
`Now that I have announced that I'm your ally, I too will make as great an effort as possible to lend you my power. `
`Make an effort yourself as well. `
`If you're still hugging your knees, quickly stand back up. `
`......Umm, in times like this, what did I use to say again? `
`......Umm, uh, `
`......g- `
`go for it, `
`yea~h. `
`Meep, `
`nipah~{p:0:☆} `
`......It's so embarrassing, doing this. `
`...I've done this much for you, so quickly stand back up. `
`"...Ah, there you are. `
`I wonder where Bern shrank off to? `
`*giggle* Could she be any more lame?" `
`Even so. `
`Just like usual, the pieces Bern chooses are pretty shabby. `
`It's the same with chess, right? `
`If all of your pieces were pawns, you'd have zero chance to win, right? `
`If all of your pieces were rooks and bishops, you definitely wouldn't lose. `
`...W-Well, last time, right when I felt just a little pity and said she could start with her pieces anywhere she wanted, `
`that idiot Bern, without taking notice of my compassion, started with all of her pawns on my side of the board!! `
`What's up with that? That wasn't a loss or anything!! `
`Aaah, just remembering it makes me queasy. `
`Because of that, I won't be able to rest until I see Bern's speechless face. `
`And since you, Bern's piece, fucked up so bad, I'm feeling just great! `
`Plus, she may not look it, but that girl really hates to lose, `
`so I'll bet she's off somewhere grinding her teeth and crying her eyes out right now. `
`How totally lame, *giggle*, hoohohohohohohohoh! `
`C'mon, laugh with me, ohohohohoh! `
`......Wait a sec. `
`Are you still hugging your knees? `
`You're already like this just because Beato got a little serious? `
`Could you be any more pathetic? `
`You're so pathetic, I'll help you just a little bit. `
`I, the great Lady Lambdadelta, the Witch of Certainty and the strongest in the universe, `
`will associate myself just a tiny bit with you and your hopeless chances at winning. `
`You should thank me. `
`You know, Beatrice may really be a cruel and powerful witch, but she's no match for me. `
`Why? `
`Because she's soft. `
`Though she'll set up the board in a way that'll let her win with just a few more moves, she'll intentionally avoid cornering you. `
`She'll do things like take worthless pieces and place excess pieces on the board to make things more one-sided. `
`Simply put, she's got the bad habit of playing around as soon as she thinks she's won. `
`Almost all the various attacks that hurt you and Bern...... `
`look like utter waste and overkill to me. `
`...In other words, she's got a weakness, and you've got a chance. `
`See? `
`She isn't an opponent to be afraid of, right? `
`She sometimes mistakes her means for her ends. `
`And she has too much dark fun. `
`Sometimes, that even ends up creating and exposing her own weak points. `
`For a super-powerful witch like me, it's hard to understand why she's able to act so tough. `
`Why she lowers her own chances of winning. `
`......But, well. `
`Because of that, a witch like Bern, who likes to thoroughly read her opponent, has a really bad affinity with her. `
`Because reading her doesn't work. `
`...Maybe it's really easy for Bern to read and handle a straightforward and honest type like me. `
`Annoyingly enough! `
`...Well, still, a super firepower type like me can flat out beat up a light, wide-range barrage type like Beatrice, `
`so it's kinda like rock-paper-scissors. `
`If I'm paper, Beato is rock. `
`Which means Bern is scissors. `
`Well, maybe that doesn't matter. `
`Even though my paper loses to Bern's scissors, `
`if I was a sheet of super-paper, which is way more awesome than normal paper, I could beat even scissors, right?! `
`Bascially, I, Lady Lambdadelta, `
`am {ruby:a moron:super-paper}! `
`Hohohohoh! `
`It looks like you've regained a bit of your color. `
`That Beato, she's having fun torturing some piece called Rosa. `
`At a glance, you'd think she has really nasty tastes, right? `
`Wrong. `
`...She's just killing time, hoping that you'll stand back up and return. `
`It's a move to fire up your righteous indignation by intentionally doing something detestable. `
`Ah man, I hate kids like that! `
`Anyway, I'll head on back. `
`Ah! `
`Don't tell anyone about me helping you out just a little bit! `
`I mean, it's not like I helped you because I wanted to save you, okay?! `
`I, the strongest witch in the universe, had my throne stolen away when I lost to Bern! `
`So I've gotta take that throne back from her, `
`but if she loses to Beato here, then it's Beato who'll get the position of strongest next, right?! `
`...Well, it's not like I'm complaining. It'd be easier to steal the throne back from Beato, but then I wouldn't be satisfied, you see?! `
`I will defeat Bern! `
`And I'll take back my position as the strongest! `
`It's not like I'm really helping you, okay?! `
`I won't forgive you if you make Bern cry! `
