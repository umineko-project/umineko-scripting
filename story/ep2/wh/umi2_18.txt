`"Where are you, Beatrice?!! `
`Show yourself!! `
`Beatriiiiiice!!" `
`Rosa finally arrived at the chapel. `
`She pointed her gun around her, screaming the witch's name, but there was no way she would receive an answer. `
`After grimacing slightly, she noisily approached the table where her siblings' corpses still lay exposed...and stretched out her arm towards a gold ingot. `
`It was very heavy, but Rosa didn't mind. `
`She wrapped that one up in a blanket and threw it over her shoulder. `
`"At least...just this one... `
`This alone should be worth over 10 million..." `
`Without letting go of her gun, Rosa picked up the gold as well. `
`...Her shoulders were screaming. but Rosa didn't mind. `
`"...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi. `
`It will happen very soon. `
`...Very soon, the door to the Golden Land...will open." `
`"Stop laughing with that creepy voice!! `
`Where is Beatrice?! `
`Yeah, I know, she's around here somewhere, right?! `
`You know where, right?! `
`Where is she?!" `
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihi. `
`I don't know. `
`Even if you don't search for her, you'll be able to see her in the Golden Land. `
`...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi, `
`ouch." `
`"Stop laughing like that!! `
`...Aaah, it almost makes me want to laugh!! `
`That's right, that was definitely a witch, definitely a witch!! `
`I didn't understand, I thought she was a human calling herself a witch, but I was wrong!!!" `
`"...That really was a witch!! `
`I won't be fooled by something like that!! `
`You're there, right?! `
`Come out, show yourself!! `
`Beatriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice!!!" `
`"I told you, she'll appear very soon. `
`The door to the Golden Land will be opened. `
`...Kihihihihihihihihihihihi..." `
`"......That's right. `
`Isn't that splendid! `
`I care not, I abandon that rook! `
`You, woman, are a king that cannot be reached without the resolve to lose everything one has. `
`I'll corner you, Beatriiiiice. `
`Hihahahahahahahahahaha!" `
`"At least call me a queen. `
`Hoh, what a brilliant move. `
`So your blood...no, the Ushiromiya blood is bad at giving up." `
`"...How pleasant! `
`What an truly elegant night. `
`Hehahahahahahaha...!!" `
`"......Master, Beatrice-sama. `
`It will soon be time for the banquet." `
`"Already? `
`...That was fast. `
`Every night I pass with you goes by swiftly, `
`the moon falls like an apple, and the sun leaps out of the river like a small fish." `
`"It is time, so let us go. `
`...Rise, Battler. `
`The banquet to celebrate my revival will now begin." `
`"I'll introduce you as my new furniture...no, as my toy. `
`To the dignitaries among witches." `
`The witch was relaxing elegantly, her feet thrown out from the sofa and resting on top of a footrest. `
`...However, the footrest wasn't a part of the sofa, ...but a Human. `
`A Human down on all fours... `
`"...Beatrice-sama, your silk dress." `
`"You are the guest of honor, but I am the host. `
`I will go out first. `
`It would have been nice if Shannon were here to help dress you, but, unfortunately, it seems she no longer remains." `
`"...She's never around when I want to use her. `
`An entirely useless person. `
`......However, you did well to remain here. `
`...I'm happy, my friend." `
`"...I am grateful for your words." `
`"Good. `
`Wait downstairs, you two. `
`Genji, good work, set the dress down over there." `
`"...Certainly. `
`......Well then, Master." `
`"We will go first. `
`...Beatrice, I will see you later." `
`"Indeed." `
`Kinzo and Genji left the study. `
`After that, the witch and the dress and the furniture remained. `
`"......Do you know why I am not embarrassed to show myself to you naked...?" `
`"............" `
`"It's because you're furniture. `
`Fuuurniture. `
`Understand? `
`Furniture, just fuuurniture! `
`Who would feel shame at exposing their body to furniture? `
`So there's no reason for me to feel shame in front of you. `
`...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!" `
`The witch rose and her jacket slipped off, just from her shoulders. `
`...After that, the jacket fell to the ground with a thump. `
`When the furniture respectfully approached to pick up those clothes, the witch gave it a small kick, and it fell over. `
`...The furniture was afraid of what misconduct it might have shown... `
`"Do you, as furniture, plan to force me to unbutton myself? `
`...Stand. `
`And undo the buttons. `
`...One by one, with care. `
`Quickly. `
`Gracefully. `
`With no mistakes. `
`The guests are being kept waiting, so change my clothes quickly." `
`".........Yes..." `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, kakakaka, hahahahahahaha!! `
`Undo them with care. `
`Those buttons are each worth more than one of your eyeballs. `
`...If you make a mistake and break them, I'll sow your eyeballs in instead... `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!" `
`The entrance hall was bustling with a crowd of shadowy people. `
`And it sparkled gold with the gold butterflies flying about. `
`The gentlemen in suits and tuxedos and the ladies in dresses looked like they were having a great number of friendly chats. `
`At a glance, it might have looked like a fabulous medieval ball. `
`But they all had one thing in common, and that thing was exceedingly bizarre. `
`...Because all of them...had goat heads. `
`Was it a goat mask masquerade, `
`......or did they really have goat heads? `
`...It probably couldn't be the latter, but in this bizarre world, I really didn't know which was true... `
`Kinzo was amongst those goat nobles, greeting them. `
`Kinzo's greetings were more respectful than would have been expected, as though these were all honored guests. `
`At that time, Genji's voice rang out through the hall. `
`It was a voice calling for silence. `
`That voice stopped the idle chatter, and everyone turned to face Genji. `
`"......Tonight, we celebrate the appearance of our Golden Witch, who has achieved her revival, `
`the Lady Beatrice. `
`Everyone, please welcome her with your applause." `
`When Genji began to applaud, it quickly spread through the guests and became a roaring ovation. `
`Then, ......the Golden Witch appeared from the top of the large staircase... `
`As she gracefully waved her hand, ...followed by a piece of furniture she was fond of, she slowly descended the staircase... `
`The goat nobles offered unanimous words of celebration in some long-forgotten language. `
`And those who were deeply intimate embraced, filled with joy at their reunion. `
`As the witch offered greetings of reunion, ...the witch's furniture followed behind her the whole time. `
`......There was a chain around its neck. `
`The other end was gripped in the witch's hand, like it was a trained dog. `
`It wasn't there to restrain him. `
`...Those chains were a restraining device whose only purpose was to wound the furniture's dignity... `
`He wasn't permitted to wear anything else on his body. `
`One of the young women goats mixed in with the goat nobles... `
`quietly removed her goat mask as the furniture passed in front of her, and she spoke with eyes that had no light in them. `
`That face...seemed to belong to a long-haired young girl... `
`"......How pitiful." `
`"Ooh, Lady Bernkastel. `
`Welcome. `
`Do you like my furniture?" `
`"......That's a nice hobby." `
`After saying only that, the witch called Bernkastel once again put on her goat mask... `
`and was swallowed up by the shadows of the other tall goats... `
`"Ahahahahahahaha... `
`Sore loser. `
`She's ticked off, isn't she?" `
`"You're not wrong. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!" `
`The young women goats giggled, and the witch once again let out a high-pitched laugh. `
`"Thank you for gathering here for my sake!! `
`Why don't we enjoy to the fullest this 'banquet of the witch', where old friends have gathered from past and present, east and west...!" `
`"Come, we will eat all night, `
`drink all night, `
`slurp all night, `
`and chew to bits all night as we enjoy ourselves!! `
`Look at the clock as it marks when the ending hour and the beginning hour melt together, ...come!! `
`Let us begin the banquet of the witch!!!" `
`When the witch announced the beginning of the banquet, the large clock pointed to 24:00, and the sound of a bell began to ring out... `
`"Come, ...now is the time!! `
`Open the golden door......!!!" `
`All at once, the butterflies leafed in gold flew all around the inside of the room. `
`Amidst the golden storm and the brilliant gold-colored light, the barrier between this world and another...was cut open... `
`Surrounded by the goats' delighted voices, the mansion of the human world and the mansion of those not human overlapped, `
`...and the members of the household who praised the resurrection of the Golden Witch scattered into gold butterflies... `
`and poured out of the depths of hell... `
`It was...a golden...tornado. `
`...A rondo of golden demons. `
`Come, tonight we will put aside rank. `
`Throw open the wine cellar, `
`drop the snake's head into the liquor pot, `
`throw cows and chickens into the furnace alive, `
`drink and eat and sing and dance, `
`sneer and kill and desecrate and degrade!! `
`"Aaaaaahh, Beatrice!! `
`Take me to the Golden Land now! `
`To the Golden Laaaaaaaaaaaaaand!!! `
`Ooooooohhhhhhhhh, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!" `
`The goat nobles were suddenly crushing in around Kinzo. `
`...Almost like they were kids demanding the signature of some famous movie star. `
`There were only two differences. `
`First, these were witches, not kids. `
`And second, what these witches demanded was not a signature. `
`The sea of goat nobles began to drown Kinzo. `
`Only Kinzo's laughing voice echoed throughout the area. `
`It was a grand mixture of laughter and his death throes. `
`And Kinzo became wine and meat and bread. `
`An aroma if slurped, a rich taste if gnawed, and pleasant to tear to bits! `
`The sound of his death throes lingered on sweetly, `
`and if adorned with melted chocolate and golden argent, it would make a wonderful dessert! `
`If you took the bones home, you could also use them in a soup, `
`and the remains could even become toys for the children to play with, `
`and they could also become splendid tools for fortune-telling that always brought misfortune! `
`That entire scene...was watched by the furniture. `
`It was all fantastical. `
`...It was all demonic. `
`...Was the quaking of its supposedly paralyzed heart...proof that it could still feel fear? `
`At that time, its knees buckled, and the furniture's body fell down in the middle of the carpet. `
`After all, the witch had kicked those knees from behind. `
`"Kneel and show your respect. `
`Rub your forehead against the carpet and show how vulgar you are. `
`Put your hands behind your back and swear that you will offer all your flesh and blood to me." `
`".........Nngg, ......ah......" `
`The furniture let out a painful voice. `
`...Fear is the most basic emotion Humans have. `
`...Was that emotion reviving his sense of self, which should already have been slain? `
`"......Hmph. `
`So, you are still far from suitable for my furniture. `
`Very well! `
`I will carefully finish you, making you into the kind of furniture I like, the kind fitting only for me. `
`...As you are now, I doubt you can offer more than entertainment for our guests!" `
`The goat nobles were surrounding the crouching furniture... `
`It seemed their blazing, blood-red eyes couldn't hide their ecstasy at this new young food they'd been given. `
`And from the ugly teeth that stuck out of countless mouths, saliva, `
`...or maybe the traces of meat and wine that they had just eaten, ...dribbled down... `
`"......Eee......eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!!" `
`As the furniture let out a wild scream, it retreated, still sitting on its backside. `
`...But the circle of goat nobles was closing in... `
`Then, the furniture looked at the witch's face. `
`...It had surrendered to the witch, so, believing that the witch would show some compassion, it stared at her face in the end. `
`But there was nothing but scorn on the witch's face, and she wasn't even facing the furniture anymore. `
`The witch went off to greet an honored guest with whom she had crossed gazes... `
`The goat nobles looked down upon the furniture. `
`Actually, they had been waiting. `
`Just like how one must remove the cork in order to drink champagne, `
`they had to wait for one thing before partaking of the offering served at this banquet. `
`Of course, the furniture didn't know about this thing. `
`...But it came out of his mouth all by itself. `
`Just like the unavoidable pop of a cork, it inevitably came out of his mouth. `
`"...G... `
`...yaa, `
`...ahiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!" `
`--It was a scream. `
`It was a sign that marked the beginning...of the modest banquet at which he was to be served. `
`"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaa `
`gebukikyakyakaku `
`oooogaageoe `
`ooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa `
`aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa `
`aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah...!!!" `
`Gabubogyagukigukiboryu. `
`By now, the garden was one of both roses and gold. `
`A gold-colored garden where gold butterflies, gold fairies, and gold lizards rampaged and flew about wildly. `
`"Maria, quickly!! `
`Run!! `
`Quickly quickly quickly quickly!!" `
`Rosa grasped her gun and the blanket wrapped around the ingot... `
`and ran at a speed Maria couldn't match, sometimes pausing to call out at Maria to run faster. `
`So she saw it every time. `
`...She saw the golden pursuers chasing them from the mansion! `
`The mass of gold butterflies was chasing after them like a massive crawling hand!! `
`And strange-looking shadows with goat heads were chasing after them...!! `
`There was no need for her to strain her eyes. `
`Because those blazing pupils told her what would happen if she was captured. `
`"......Mama, wait, `
`Mama, wait, `
`...uu-uu-, `
`...ow!!" `
`Maria fell down. `
`For just an instant, Rosa was ashamed by thoughts of abandoning her daughter and running away, and at the instant her feet touched ground, she ran back. `
`The goat head that had sprinted over to get the first bite... `
`grabbed hold of the back of Rosa's own child's hair and pulled...!! `
`"Mamaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, `
`noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!" `
`Rosa rammed into the goat head with her shoulder, `
`spun, `
`bashed the back of her elbow into the goat's jaw, `
`and buried her knee into its protruding chest!! `
`And she thrust the barrel of the gun inside the goat head's mouth as it doubled over from the pain in its gut! `
`"...Just try laying one finger on Maria in front of me. `
`I'll show you just how lukewarm the hell you came from is." `
`The blast from the Winchester's 45 caliber Long Colt bullet exploded inside the goat head's throat... `
`and its medulla oblongata was instantly pulverized. `
`The goat head hadn't understood. `
`It had thought women were like pre-opened wine bottles! `
`It had thought that turning them upside down would immediately make their deep-red contents come out! `
`"Mama!! `
`Mamaaaaaa!!" `
`Maria, who had been released, hugged Rosa. `
`But the pursuers were still coming! `
`They could see the giant goat heads, who had given up pretending to be Human, running towards them from across the rose bushes. `
`Rosa spilled several extra bullets, which had been in the pocket of her coat, all over the place, and told Maria to pick them up. `
`"Y-Yes...! `
`Pick up, pick up...!!" `
`"Maria, `
`if Mama falls down, `
`run. `
`Go to the shore. `
`And swim, and swim, and swim! `
`There's nowhere for us to survive on this island!!" `
`"N-No!! `
`I'll stay with Mama!! `
`Uuu--!!" `
`Rosa's gun roared four times. `
`But even though four shots really did hit the massive, approaching goats in the chest, they didn't even flinch!! `
`The goats ran with a violent vigor, as though they planned to crush Rosa and Maria with those massive bodies!! `
`"Put the bullet in!! `
`Quickly!!" `
`"U-Uu-!!" `
`Rosa grasped the blanket with the ingot in both hands, `
`and she herself sprinted, pulling it along!! `
`Without even an ounce of fear of those strange-looking giants!! `
`If it's to protect my daughter, I'll overcome even hell!! `
`"I'll show you... `
`this golden dreeeeeeeeeeam!!!" `
`Rosa roared. `
`The goat heads roared. `
`That terribly heavy ingot, after picking up a fearsome centrifugal force and speed, slammed into the head of the goat head. `
`Rosa pulled a fountain pen from her pocket. `
`But she held it crooked. `
`She placed it in her palm, `
`in the gap between her middle finger and her ring finger so that it stuck out when she made a fist, almost like a stinger was growing out of it. `
`That stinger sliced into the left eye of the goat head as it fell over. `
`Was the goat head's roar a scream? `
`But Rosa's roar was different. `
`She pulled back her fist and slammed it into the fountain pen that was still sticking into the goat head's eye. `
`The pointed tip was gouged into the depths of its head...! `
`"Mama, the bullet went in!!" `
`"Good job!!" `
`As I grabbed the gun Maria had thrown, I finally heard the thunderous crash of the giant tumbling to earth. `
`However, at the same time, I saw the goat head pursuers on the other side of the rose bushes increase in number. `
`I've gained enough distance for now! `
`I held onto the blanket wrapped around the ingot and the gun...and once again ran with Maria. `
`...Why am I running with a gun in my right hand and the gold in my left? `
`Why don't I let go with one hand and grasp Maria's hand...?!! `
`I can't let go of the gun that protects my body. `
`I can't let go of the gold that protects my future. `
`But even so, I've let go of the hand of my daughter, the one who is my future...?! `
`Run. `
`Run. Run. `
`She got out of the rose garden and began to run down a staircase through a grove of trees. `
`But Rosa knew. `
`This path through the grove turned and twisted many times, and only seemed to be long. `
`She tore straight through it! `
`She had played here often since her childhood years. `
`So she knew! `
`To the beach. To the beach. `
`To the sea, to the sea, to the sea. `
`And after reaching the sea? `
`Nothing to do but swim, swim, swim, and if Maria can't swim, I'll carry her as I swim!! `
`There's nothing but death on this island! `
`"Kya!!!" `
`"Mamaaaa?!" `
`As she raced down the stairs, she took a bad step. `
`A violent pain ran up her left ankle, and her mind went completely blank. `
`Rosa fell down several stairs, shocked by her ankle, which was bent at an odd angle. `
`...And the blanket with the ingot wasn't there. `
`She had let go of it the instant she fell, and it had disappeared somewhere into the darkness. `
`Only the gun was left. `
`Tremors in the earth were getting closer. `
`It was only a matter of time before the goat heads flooded in. `
`She didn't want to imagine how many there would be, or how strange they would look. `
`The lightly dancing gold pursuers arrived. `
`The gold butterflies surrounded Rosa and Maria, waving and clamoring as though saying 'the prize is here, the prize is here'. `
`Rosa couldn't even try to get up. `
`The violent pain from her broken ankle was so great that she couldn't ignore it, even in her last moments. `
`Aaaaaaaaaaaaah, what am I doing... `
`I had the gold, which would've been worth several million yen. `
`I might've been able to start over with that!! `
`And yet I fell, lost it, and now my own life is in danger, and Maria's too?! `
`...What has my life been?!!! `
`I was born into an incomprehensible family! `
`With irritating older siblings since the day I was born!! `
`What did I do?! `
`No matter what I did or didn't do, I was always in trouble and bullied and made fun of!! `
`What has my life been?!?! `
`"Mama, ...Mama, Mama...!!" `
`"........." `
`The roar inside Rosa's heart shriveled away and disappeared. `
`...It disappeared when she heard Maria's crying voice, as she sobbed and clung to Rosa. `
`"......Maria, `
`Mama remembered something she's got to do. `
`Please go on ahead." `
`"No, no no no no!! `
`I wanna stay with Mama!! `
`I don't want Mama to die!!" `
`"Maria, `
`...even though I'm such a bad Mama, `
`...you still say you want to stay with me?" `
`"Yeah...! `
`...I wanna stay with you, `
`...wanna stay with Mama...!" `
`"...I made it look like I was putting you first, `
`...but I was always putting you off. `
`I went to your athletic meet, `
`I went to Parent's Day, `
`...but I was always thinking about how I appeared to the world, and you were never in my eyes. `
`...Are you saying...that you want to stay with that kind of mother...? `
`Even though, `
`...I've been such a bad mother......?!!" `
`"Hey, Mama. `
`...Did you know? `
`You're my only Mama in this world. `
`There's no good Mama or bad Mama. `
`...There's just one Mama. `
`So I don't need any other Mama in this world. `
`And I wanna be your one and only Maria." `
`"......The Maria you wanna spoil when you're in a good mood...and the Maria who's a nuisance and you don't want to be around...aren't different people. `
`There's only one Maria. `
`...So the scary Mama and the nice Mama are the same. `
`......To me, `
`...they're my one and only... `
`Mama..." `
`"...............I was... `
`...such... `
`...an idiot... `
`......I didn't need gold. `
`If only I had just pulled you by the hand... `
`...I was such... `
`...a stupid Mama...!!" `
`The shadows of the goats covered the sky even more thoroughly than the trees of the forest. `
`Their roars blotted out the world with fear. `
`Rosa, still hugging Maria, readied her gun with one hand. `
`"Maria, let's go together. `
`I'll never leave you. `
`...Let's always stay together so that Mama never gets lost again...!" `
`"Yeah...!! `
`We'll be able to see each other soon. `
`We'll be together forever...!! `
`...We'll be able to see each other...in the Golden Land...!! `
`And then we'll play together! `
`Play with the 'Wolves and Sheep Puzzle'!! `
`Mama hasn't solved more than one of the puzzles, but I've solved them all. `
`So I'll be the riddle-giver!!" `
`She had bought it as a birthday present...and then hadn't played it with Maria after that first night. `
`"Yes, we'll play together!!! `
`I promise!!!" `
`"Mamaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!" `
`Those eyes, sparkling like red-hot lava, looked just like a group of fireflies. `
`They danced, closed in, and attacked. `
`"Aaaaaaaaaahhh, come ooooooon!! `
`Let whoever wants to eat the bullet Maria chambered for me step forwaaaaaaard, `
`aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!" `
