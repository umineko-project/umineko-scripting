`"................................." `
`Rosa awoke from her doze. `
`...It must have been a very deep sleep. `
`Her mind was hazy, and she wasn't thinking clearly. `
`Where is this...? `
`It felt like some mansion, but it didn't seem to be the Ushiromiya mansion. `
`She could see a room that looked like a parlor. `
`...And there was some tea that had been prepared. `
`It had probably been made for her. `
`Around the room, some glitter that looked like gold leaf drifted about, making the scene look quite fantastical. `
`...When she eventually realized that they were gold butterflies, it further strengthened that impression. `
`There was someone across from her. `
`...A woman. `
`...A lady. `
`......It was the portrait's... `
`witch. `
`She seemed to be having a one-sided conversation. `
`She was probably talking to Rosa, `
`but Rosa, whose mind was clouded up by a deep fog, didn't have a clue what was being said... `
`"...Choose whatever you please. `
`If there is anything you want, I'll give it all to you. `
`You can think of it as a reward for your good luck, or else as proper compensation for how you've answered to my demands." `
`"It may have been a truly trivial matter from your perspective. `
`However, the deal was important enough to me to be deserving of this reward." `
`......What is she...talking about? `
`...I don't know, `
`...I don't know. `
`"It's just that...I am very much a witch. `
`Perhaps you'd best ask for something only a witch can give you." `
`"What a rare chance this is. `
`To actually receive the favor of Beatrice the Golden, me. `
`*cackle*cackle*!" `
`".........Nng......" `
`Finally, Rosa started to feel the blood flowing through her body. `
`...Her movements were still sluggish, and she couldn't even voice the words she was thinking. `
`"I am commonly called the Golden Witch. `
`Bestowing a mountain of gold, like the one I gave Kinzo, is trivial to me. `
`...After all, you can measure all the pleasures of the human world with money. `
`Therefore, gold is no more or less than the manifestation of the human world's pleasures." `
`"Can you imagine it? `
`A mountain of gold that you couldn't use up as long as you lived." `
`As the witch blew on her pipe, multi-colored smoke enshrouded their surroundings. `
`As she did this, the inside of the parlor...was suddenly filled with stacks of gold ingots. `
`It looked like a shining gold-colored wall. `
`...If each ingot was worth several ten million yen, `
`how much would all of this be worth? `
`It seemed sinful to even think of such a number. `
`"...However, the human world is difficult. `
`I know there are some things that cannot be settled, no matter how high into the sky you pile up gold. `
`I know there are cracks that cannot be filled. `
`I won't make light of that, which is why this is a gift that only a witch such as I can give." `
`"...Why don't I fill those cracks in for you? `
`Yes, how about this. `
`It's something only I can give. `
`You should be very happy." `
`"...No need to thank me out loud. `
`I can tell right away. It's written on your face and in the corners of your heart, *cackle*cackle*!" `
`Rosa felt a touch of discomfort at this witch, `
`who kept on talking even though Rosa hadn't uttered a single word, `
`but since she still couldn't manage to speak...and was so helpless that it was difficult to even move a finger, `
`she couldn't do anything but listen. `
`"How far must the deep wounds in your heart recede before they can be healed? `
`......This is... `
`......deep... `
`quite deep indeed. `
`...Sometimes, wounds close up while a fragment of foreign matter remains inside. `
`...Even when such wounds appear to have healed, they continue to throb for all eternity. `
`Sometimes, you have to open the wound once more in order to heal it completely." `
`As the witch spoke, she stared deep into Rosa's eyes. `
`...What in the world...was she peering at? `
`Rosa felt uncomfortable, but she couldn't look away. `
`"......So, your pain was already fated by the time of your birth. `
`...How heart-breaking. `
`...You don't have to say it. `
`I understand. `
`...I understand..." `
`Rosa was gradually being sucked into the witch's eyes. `
`Then, the world grew dark, spinning round and round as she was sucked in... `
`Rosa, Rosa. `
`Why are you such an idiot? `
`Oh, that's Krauss nii-san's voice. `
`Krauss nii-san is a real adult, so he's very smart. `
`So he hated the stupid kid, Rosa. `
`He was a very scary person. I was often hit, and my toys were taken from me and broken. `
`I was apparently being punished for something bad I'd done, but I never really understood what it was, or why I was being punished. `
`I was always punished suddenly and then later told what the punishment was for, in a forced manner, `
`but it was always something I didn't remember doing. `
`...So I really hated Krauss nii-san. `
`Rosa, Rosa. `
`Why are you such an idiot? `
`Oh, that's Eva nee-san's voice. `
`Eva nee-san is a real adult, so she's very smart. `
`So she hated the stupid kid, Rosa. `
`She was always a very sly person, and she often lied to me, tricked me, bullied me all the time. `
`Apparently I was stupid, and she said it was only natural for stupid people to be swindled by those smarter than them. `
`So I wanted to become a wise person like Eva nee-san, and listened to what she said, but when I obeyed her, for some reason, someone always got really mad at me. `
`...So I really hated Eva nee-san. `
`Rosa, Rosa. `
`Why are you such an idiot? `
`Oh, that's Rudolf nii-san's voice. `
`Rudolf nii-san really knows how to get things done. `
`So he hated the stupid kid, Rosa. `
`When Krauss nii-san was around, he would be friendly with Krauss nii-san. `
`When Eva nee-san was around, he would be friendly with Eva nee-san. `
`...And when Krauss nii-san wasn't around, he would be violent like Krauss nii-san, `
`and when Eva nee-san wasn't around, he would play dirty like Eva nee-san. `
`And even though he was also bullied most of the time, `
`when Krauss nii-san and Eva nee-san weren't around, he gave me two people's worth of bullying. `
`...So I really hated Rudolf nii-san. `
`...Oh, but these were my memories from when I was a kid. `
`It's common for unfair things to happen between kids. `
`And you mustn't hold onto grudges for such things forever. `
`With time, those memories get buried away, and forgetting them bit by bit is supposed to be part of growing up and becoming an adult. `
`So becoming an adult is the same as separating yourself from all those memories. `
`And because of that. `
`No matter how much time passed, Rosa couldn't become an adult. `
`...Even though she had been blessed with a daughter called Maria and was called a mother, `
`...she didn't at all feel like she had become an adult. `
`The witch pitied her for that. `
`And she smiled, saying that she could heal that pain herself. `
`"...How can I heal you? `
`It's possible, but not easy. `
`...I might rewind time, and giving you a world where you have no older siblings." `
`"But that way, your 'memories of being hurt by your older siblings' wouldn't remain, `
`and in that sense, while you might call it a gift, you wouldn't be able to accept it." `
`"A person is only satisfied when their starvation is healed. `
`But if you make it so they never starved in the first place, none of them will thank you. `
`Just like how there are no young people who give thanks for their daily gluttony. `
`...Understand?" `
`I think she's telling me something really complicated. `
`...In short, even if she makes it so I never had older siblings, that wouldn't remove my pain... `
`Maybe that's what she's saying. `
`Strictly speaking, that's not quite right. `
`Healing isn't the same thing as removing pain. `
`It's the pleasure we earn as compensation for withstanding pain. `
`Therefore, removing the pain isn't healing. `
`To know the joy of healing, you have to know the pain. `
`"Which means...you must know joy, in order to compensate you for your pain. `
`You should be proud of your past sufferings. `
`After all, they are what make it possible for you to know pleasure that those without pain will never experience. `
`...Those who experience this pleasure...cannot help but pass on the same joy to others... `
`*cackle*cackle*..." `
`When the witch snapped her fingers, even though the room was still filled with a mountain of gold and had already lost all semblance of reality, `
`a fabulous tablecloth appeared on top of the table... `
`and a wonderful meal was laid out, almost as though it was the opening of a banquet in a castle from some fairy tale. `
`For an instant, Rosa truly did feel a pleasurable surprise at how fabulous it was, `
`...but at the same time, she felt a bit of anticlimax. `
`After all, she didn't think being bullied by her siblings `
`could be wiped away by just one meal, no matter how delicious. `
`"Food is the source of many human pleasures. `
`You simply must eat like a pig as long as you live." `
`"If one meal isn't enough, then have as many as you want. `
`Until the pain of your heart is healed, why not continue this gourmet banquet? `
`...Begin it, furniture." `
`As the witch clapped twice, `
`there were suddenly two goat head servants there, and they began to prepare the meal. `
`From the beautiful dishes adorning the table, they efficiently took some food and began to pile it up on Rosa's plate. `
`It really did look delicious, but Rosa's body still felt as heavy as lead, `
`and there was no way she'd be able to eat. `
`Maybe they also understood that. `
`The goat head servants tied a napkin around Rosa's collar... `
`and gallantly brought a glass of before-dinner alcohol to her mouth, tilting it for her. `
`She remembered an old servant who had once carried rice porridge to her mouth when she was laid up with a high fever. `
`She couldn't drink it well, and it dripped down from her mouth, but she felt the fragrant sweetness spread throughout her mouth. `
`"It's a sweet aperitif of noble rot German-made wine. `
`A wine cocktail of white wine mixed with a crimson golden drop." `
`"If I had to give it a name, I'd call it a Bloody Krauss. `
`Soaked with just a golden drop of your brother's blood that was squeezed out of a compressor." `
`"Bghk......?! *cough*, *cough*......!!" `
`Rosa coughed violently. `
`And the bright red that stained her face made it look as though she had coughed up blood. `
`"You know a lot about black tea, so you should know what it means, right? `
`'Golden drop' refers to the last drop in a drink. `
`It is called the most precious drop in black tea." `
`"......So a golden drop of blood is the same. `
`The last and most precious drop of blood squeezed out of a human. `
`We squeeze it using that." `
`As the witch snapped her fingers, a bright red veil that had been set up before something large was removed. `
`...The solemn and massive machine there was just like... `
`a coffin for a large-sized person, with many large bulb-like things stuck to it, `
`and it looked like a sinister torture device. `
`By its unnerving shape, `
`she could tell that with a human's strength, it could be used to tighten and compress something. `
`...And it seemed that there were still some squeezed dregs remaining, `
`...because of the bright red remains that stained it. `
`"But you can't take more than one golden drop at once. `
`No matter what kind of human you take it from, you can't get more than one drop. `
`But I am a witch. `
`Reviving a person is easy for me." `
`When the witch snapped her fingers, the human compressor suddenly began to shake. `
`...No, she could also hear a groan. `
`...It looked almost as though...someone sleeping in that man-sized coffin... `
`had woken up, and was now struggling to get out. `
`But that was wrong. `
`What was inside definitely had been {i:squeezed dregs}. `
`Using her magic, the witch had once again revived the squeezed dregs to how they'd been before they were squeezed. `
`Three goat head servants with muscular physiques approached the compressor...and forcefully started tightening the large bulb. `
`...As they did, an unearthly moan came from inside the coffin. `
`...Rosa thought she knew the owner of that voice. `
`"It is fitting for cooking to be done in the kitchen. `
`Enough, stand back." `
`"...Do you understand how precious a golden drop is? `
`To have it stained this crimson requires that {i:several dozen people's worth} be squeezed." `
`The witch definitely said that only one golden drop could be taken from a single human. `
`And yet, she had dozens of people's worth of golden drops from a single human. `
`...Only a witch could do this. `
`The Golden Witch Beatrice could kill a single human 'endlessly'. `
`...In other words, before Beatrice, even death did not mean freedom. `
`"Do you need me to put it a different way? `
`Have you forgotten the day this man hit you, when you swallowed the blood that ran into your mouth?" `
`"That's right, remember that taste. `
`Remember the taste of the tears that you spilled until you were dry. `
`I believe this aperitif will be sufficient to heal that regrettable memory. `
`*cackle*cackle*!!" `
`Once again, the goat head servants tilted a deep red glass against her mouth. `
`...Rosa tried resisting by closing her lips, `
`but the deep red liquid was relentlessly poured into her mouth, which hung open with shock, `
`and the inside of her mouth was filled with a ghastly sweetness... `
`It definitely was a fragrant sweetness. `
`The living blood of her brother, who had given her such hateful thoughts and made her soak her pillow so many times, `
`had been collected from his death, repeated dozens of times. How could the crimson-stained wine not be sweet? `
`But Rosa tried to spit it out. `
`Because of that, the deep red wine that spilled out of Rosa's mouth looked just like a bloodstain. `
`...Now that she knew that this ghastly substance wasn't a simple aperitif, `
`Rosa couldn't help but feel uncomfortable about what would happen if this banquet continued. `
`"That is a double-tongued salad made from vegetables in season. `
`...On your 9th birthday, you made a wish that you'd someday get to chew this to bits, this salad made from Eva's tongue." `
`"............!!!" `
`When Rosa heard the true nature of the pink-colored meat piled up in the salad, `
`she had a sudden impulse to vomit her guts out. `
`...Furthermore, the goat servants stuck a fork in it...and carried it to Rosa's mouth. `
`"How does your double-tongued sister taste? `
`It must be quite soft and enchanting, right? `
`*cackle*cackle*!" `
`It probably would be quite sweet, soft and enchanting in her mouth. `
`After all, Eva's lies were always sweet, and young Rosa had always listened to them. `
`...And, you might say the stimulating pepper seasoning expressed the truth behind those lies well. `
`"......mnnnnnnnnnnn!! `
`Nggggnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!" `
`As the tongue salad that kept being pushed into Rosa's mouth was covered with saliva, she spat it out. `
`But the goat head servants carefully returned it to the plate and carried it to Rosa's mouth over and over again. `
`"It goes without saying, but I made this salad liberally using five of Eva's tongues. `
`You can't get more than one tongue out of a person. `
`But I can get them over and over. `
`*cackle*cackle*!!" `
`"......Nnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!! `
`Nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!" `
`As Rosa's tears dripped down, she resisted frantically. `
`However, the only way she could resist was by refusing to swallow. `
`Even if she didn't swallow it, `
`the taste of the french dressing increasingly permeated Rosa's mouth... `
`"Does it not please you...? `
`There's lots more. `
`Sea bass pie wrapped in the skin of Rudolf's face. `
`Soup with boiled brains, liver pate. `
`And look forward to dessert, *cackle*cackle*!! `
`It's not just your siblings, see? `
`I have lavishly assembled all of those whom you have trusted and yet by whom you were betrayed. `
`Why don't we continue this banquet for all eternity, until your heart is satisfied? `
`For all eternity. `
`...You're happy, right, Ushiromiya Rosaaaa? `
`Don't pretend you hate it, I know that you're actually happy, 'kay? `
`If you want to laugh, then do so, `
`and if you won't feel better until you've heard a raw performance of your annoying older siblings' screams, I'll let you hear them as much as you like. `
`Fear not, your reluctance doesn't trouble me. `
`That's just your personality, right? `
`On the inside, you're actually so happy that your skin is crawling all over. `
`And yet, on the outside, you're merely pretending that all this causes you pain, yes? `
`It's all right. Here, there is no need to worry about honor or your public image or anything, `
`so laugh as much as you want and chew it to bits. `
`Isn't this the beeest banquet, Ushiromiya Rosaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa???" `
`".........st... `
`...please, `
`...stop... `
`...*cough*, *hack*!! `
`Uugggghh..." `
`"Oh, I'm sorry, I wanted to leave dessert as a surprise, but let me reveal it now anyways. `
`Maybe that will be enough incentive for you to eat up the full course." `
`"Your dessert is that beloved daughter that you had to keep pretending to love, `
`oven-baked Maria with apples. `
`Doesn't that sound yummy?" `
`"Once you eat this, you will be released from everything. `
`Freedom, you see, freedom! `
`Finally, Rosa will gain freedom as an individual person, aren't you happyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy? `
`You should be happy, drool is hanging from your mouth, just try looking in a mirroooooooooooooooooor, hyahahaaahaahaahaha!!" `
`Suddenly, a muscular goat cook was holding Maria under his arm. `
`And Maria gazed at Rosa with a face that was only slightly sad. `
`"......Mama... `
`...Was I...a burden...?" `
`"...Nnnnnnn! `
`You aren't a burden!! `
`Nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!" `
`As Rosa spat out the food that was continually being carried to her mouth, `
`as she was covered with filth and saliva and blood, she resisted filthily and screamed. `
`"...If you... `
`think I'm a burden, `
`...I don't mind if you eat me." `
`"......After all, I'm always doing horrible things to you. `
`Even when you bring a man over, I can't stay quiet. `
`When you spend the night out with a man, I get lonely and unruly and make a mess of my room. `
`When I go to search by myself, I get lost, the police pick me up, and you're shamed. `
`When you don't come home for several days and I cry and have to be consoled by the neighbors, you're shamed." `
`"Because I'm like this, I'm a burden to Mama. `
`Sorry for being born. `
`So, I'll become delicious oven-baked apples for Mama's sake." `
`"And then, maybe Mama will be happy I exist for the first time. `
`Maybe she'll eat me and think I'm delicious. `
`Isn't it delicioooooooooooooooous? `
`Be choked up with tears of gratitude, your daughter is saying this much for you, riiiiiiiiiiiight? `
`Oven-baked apples and your beloved daughter make for the best dessert! `
`You've managed to raise such delicious ingredients, `
`aren't you the best mother, Ushiromiya Rosaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa???" `
`"......Mama, thanks for everything. `
`Bye bye." `
`"Wait!! `
`Wait, Maria, that's wrong!! `
`Stop it already, stop it already, `
`nooooooooooooooooooooooo!! `
`I didn't want something like this! `
`Please stop, please forgive me!! `
`No, `
`stop it already, `
`don't put it...in my mouth... `
`uuuuulg, `
`geeeeeeeeeeee!!" `
`"Have you been satisfied with my hospitality...? `
`Then I'll have you accept it. `
`That I am a witch. `
`Proclaim it. `
`'Ushiromiya Rosa accepts that Beatrice is a witch'!!" `
`"......I accept it!! `
`U-Ushiromiya Rosa...... `
`accepts that...... `
`Beatrice is a witch!! `
`So give Maria back!! `
`Release meeeeeeeeeeeeee!!" `
`"*cackle*cackle*, hahahahahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`I finally made you acknowledge it!! `
`That crafty Battler has already surrendered, and I made Rosa, the fool who denied me even after being invited to the Golden Land, accept it!! `
`Perfect!! `
`<It's perfect!!>" `
`"I've accomplished my perfect victory!! `
`Hehahahahahahahahakya-HAH-HAH-HAH-HAH-HAH-HA!! `
`Come, bring Maria, prepare a delicious oven roast for Rosa!!" `
`"Nooooooooooooooooooooooo, Mariaaaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaaaaa!!" `
`"Looks delicious. `
`Slice up your cow tits and make me a sandwich." `
`"Wha, ...th-that voice!! `
`Ooof?!" `
`An arm grabbed the back of the witch's head and smashed her face into the table. `
`As it did, the witch broke to pieces, turned into a cloud of gold butterflies, and reformed into her body a short distance away. `
`"...B-Battler?!?! `
`...Y-You bastard, `
`...I thought you'd surrendered so far that even your soul was furniture!!" `
`"Me too, `
`...but while I was listening to that gross recipe, I started to get a little hungry." `
`"Now I feel like eating a whole roast witch!!" `
`"And Maria. `
`It's ten years too early for you to talk about having someone eat you up. `
`But in ten years, you'd better say that to me. Promise." `
`"...Uu-. `
`Promise." `
`"B-Battler-kun...!" `
`"Sorry to keep you waiting, Aunt Rosa. `
`I'd forgotten. `
`This is a one-on-one fight between me and this woman. `
`It's totally wrong for me to give in. `
`...Thanks to you hanging in there, I've gotten my will to fight back!!" `
`...Th-This person, he gave up down to the depths of his soul and surrendered to me, didn't he...? `
`...I see, he doesn't know when to give up, just what I'd expect from Ushiromiya Kinzo's grandchild...! `
`So the chick of a phoenix is a phoenix after all...! `
`"Heh, hehahahahahahahahaha, how dashing, how amusing! `
`I wouldn't have it any other way!! `
`I wouldn't have you any other way, Battler!! `
`Try to deny me, I'll completely and thoroughly smash you to bits! `
`Let me make you surrender over and over again. I'll teach you, one who has licked my shoes, the taste of defeat over and over again!!" `
`"No problem, I'll teach you that I, Ushiromiya Battler, am a man who can stand back up even after crawling through the mud!! `
`I've never been invincible in a fight. `
`I've lost loads of times. `
`But I'll definitely crawl through the mud and stand up again. `
`And then I'll finish this!! `
`In a man's fight, you don't lose until you accept defeat, no matter how much you get beat up!!" `
`"Don't think I'm out just because you took a shot at me. `
`I'll give you a good show, Beatriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice!!" `
`"I'll accept your challenge, Ushiromiya Battler!! `
`Furniture, begin preparations for the next game!!" `
`"While we're waiting, why don't you tell me all about it? `
`There were a lot of closed rooms in this game. `
`Using red, I've smashed to bits most of the methods by which you tried to talk yourself out of them. `
`What other evasive quibbles will you show me now?!! `
`The lock to the chapel, the lock to Jessica's room, the lock to the servant room, the lock to Natsuhi's room, the lock to the parlor!! `
`Use your bizarre specialty, `
`those delusions, rantings, daydreams, and bluffs, `
`all slanted with ridiculous, incredible turns of events, and show how you can thoroughly deny meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!" `
`"Aaah, it's useless, `
`it's all useleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeess!!!" `
