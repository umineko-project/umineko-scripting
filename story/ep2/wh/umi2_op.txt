`"George-sama, please look! `
`They're so cute, look, look!" `
`Shannon found a pair of hammerhead sharks swimming playfully in the tank... `
`and looked as excited as a grade schooler seeing an aquarium for the first time. `
`"Yeah, they really are cute. `
`Almost makes me want to eat them." `
`"I-I'd feel so sorry for them... `
`Did you know? `
`I hear the Japanese are only people in the world who go to aquariums and say how delicious everything looks." `
`"Is that so? `
`...I'm sure even Americans and Italians would want to eat these." `
`"...Uh, `
`...um...... `
`err..." `
`"Those clothes look good on you. `
`Really." `
`Shannon clutched at her chest with both hands in embarrassment. `
`...She apparently felt like she was being made fun of for wearing these clothes she wasn't used to. `
`Though George's face didn't show it, he'd actually said something so completely unexpected that it surprised even him, `
`and he was as embarrassed as Shannon on the inside. `
`However, when he saw how embarrassed Shannon was, `
`he started to imagine he was teasing a girl he liked, `
`and instead of embarrassment, a ticklish amusement welled up in him. `
`......No, he wasn't just imagining it. `
`...He really was teasing the girl he liked. `
`Before now, `
`......he wouldn't have expected to hear a line like that anywhere these days, not even in a manga or something. `
`In fact, if he'd seen another couple acting like this, his first instinct would be to start throwing rocks at them. `
`But even if someone were to start throwing rocks at us now, `
`I'm sure they'd be no different than confetti celebrating our relationship. `
`Now, I can't even remember those lonely days... `
`when I felt jealous of couples who were completely oblivious to their surroundings. `
`To use an old-fashioned phrase, these really are rose-colored days I'm living in... `
`I'm so entranced that I barely notice that massive tank in the world's largest aquarium anymore. `
`Instead, all I see are the expressions flitting across Shannon's face as she plays with the fish. `
`"...It's amazing, isn't it......? `
`It's my first time seeing a tank large enough for a whale to swim in." `
`"I heard this tank is the biggest selling point here. `
`And that it's the biggest in the whole world." `
`"Is that so? `
`That's amazing. `
`......It's really wonderful. `
`It doesn't even look like a tank at all, more like they sliced off a part of the sea with a knife and brought it here." `
`"You're right. `
`This really is a little sea." `
`Despite its size, I hadn't thought of the tank as anything more than a tank. `
`That's why I found her metaphor so interesting. `
`No matter how far humans broaden their experiences, they always end up viewing the world through the lense of their own values. `
`Maybe that's why it's so interesting to interact with people who have different worldviews. `
`I voiced my thoughts on this. `
`She responded. `
`"True, this may not be the real sea. `
`...But if those little guys swimming in there believe it's the sea, then that's what it is." `
`"Even though they're inside a finite tank?" `
`"The sea is finite too. `
`Then again, even if the sea were infinite, `
`how much could we cover in our whole lives? `
`I'm sure it'd be only a minuscule fraction of the sea." `
`"...You're right. `
`It's ironic, isn't it? `
`Even though the world is so vast, most of us humans live our lives without ever leaving our own country." `
`"If the inhabitants of a place believe they're living in a complete world, `
`then even the bottom of a narrow well can be a wonderful world, an entire ocean. `
`...At least to the frogs that live there." `
`Shannon, who spent her days as a servant on a small island 10 kilometers in circumference called Rokkenjima, `
`said that with a smile. `
`After we finished walking through the whole aquarium, we had a small late-afternoon lunch at a restaurant with a nice view. `
`The word "buffet" has the power to make any boy's heart leap. `
`I was like that myself once. `
`But with Shannon beside me, this buffet felt different. `
`I couldn't shamefully pile on only the things I liked. `
`I was...how should I put it...worried about my appearance and choose a menu suited for a snob: `
`toast, salad and coffee. `
`If I'd been by myself, I would've made a pile of oily stuff like yakisoba, mashed potatoes, gratin, and so on. `
`"Shannon, is that going to be enough for you? `
`If it is, then I guess we men are animals with really bad fuel efficiency." `
`"...Umm, `
`th-that's not what I..." `
`On Shannon's tray, there was only tea and salad. `
`Maybe the mere fact that I thought she was a whole plate short proved I was thinking with a man's stomach. `
`"Actually, I should be asking you the same thing. `
`Don't you think men should eat a little bit more than that? `
`...I imagine you normally eat much more for lunch, right?" `
`"Oh, right, dang. `
`Come to think of it, you already know how much I eat normally because of meals I've had at the Head Family household." `
`"That's right. `
`So I was worried you might have an upset stomach today..." `
`Shannon was kind enough to guess that I wasn't feeling well. `
`Looks like my stupid attempt to show off made her worry. `
`And apparently, my stomach wasn't going to let me show off any longer. `
`"...Gah, ahaha... `
`Okay, I'll confess. `
`I was just trying to look cool... `
`I held back just because I was with a girl..." `
`"I thought so. `
`Considering how much you eat during lunch at the family conferences, I thought this wasn't nearly enough. `
`Please, don't be so reserved, and feel free to go choose another dish." `
`"It's not fair for only me to be embarrassed. `
`What about you, Shannon? `
`How will you be able to keep up with the Ushiromiya family workload on such a sparse diet?" `
`"......Umm, uh, `
`............au." `
`Shannon fell silent and blushed bright red. `
`Apparently, I wasn't the only one showing off. `
`When I realized that, my embarrassment disappeared completely. `
`"Oh, so that's not enough for you either, is it? `
`Yeah, you usually eat a bit more than this for lunch." `
`"A-A woman's stomach is made of magic, so this is enough... `
`au." `
`"So, we've both been showing off to each other. `
`Let's not hold back anymore, shall we?" `
`I smiled to show that I wouldn't make fun of her anymore and rose from my seat. `
`"After finally coming to Okinawa, it'd be a waste if we didn't eat some bitter melon. `
`I'll go get some fried bitter melon or something. `
`Shannon, come with me. `
`C'mon, c'mon." `
`"Ah, yes...!" `
`To anyone watching us, we might seem like an incredibly charming and embarrassing couple. `
`But it's only after becoming a couple that you realize. `
`To us, this exchange of words is everything, our entire world. `
`That's why no matter how much everyone else stares at us with blank expressions, we never notice. `
`......Indeed, at this age, I finally understand the feelings of couples who want to endlessly flirt without any regard for their surroundings. `
`After I returned with a plate piled up with fried food, Shannon arrived with a pretty cake. `
`While laughing at our fake stoicism, we resumed our lunch. `
`"Even though it's a restaurant with a view of the sea, it's so cloudy." `
`Luckily, our window seats gave us a view of seaside scenery so grandiose that it extended even beyond our field of vision. `
`However, because of the cloudy sky, we were only seeing a fraction of its usual beauty. `
`"That's right. `
`If it were clear, we'd undoubtedly see a deep blue sea." `
`"Yep. `
`I'll bet you're already used to the sea around Rokkenjima, but the deep blue of the sea here would surely have been a sight to see. `
`...It's a real shame." `
`"Oh, ...but no matter how blue the sea is at work, it might as well be gray to me. `
`But, I'm not working today, so...umm..." `
`Apparently, Shannon was doing her best to say an embarrassing line. `
`But I didn't let her get off easy. `
`"So close. `
`If only you'd said "When watching the sea alone with you, George-sama, it looks deep blue no matter how gray it is", `
`I'd have given you full marks and a prize." `
`"Uh, `
`ah, `
`I-I-I'm sorry...... `
`nnnnnn..." `
`"Wanna hear what the prize was?" `
`"Umm, `
`...... `
`uh, `
`if you don't mind telling me......" `
`"No. `
`I won't tell you. `
`Ahahahahahaha." `
`"Th-That's no fair..." `
`When I was in elementary school, I was always the kid who got bullied. `
`When everyone teased me, I grew nervous and speechless, to the delight of the bullies. `
`Back then, I wondered why everyone teased me. `
`But now, teasing Shannon like this, I understand why. `
`This is so much fun. `
`I can play with her emotions however I please, `
`...and I can have them all to myself. `
`Right now, I can't think of any greater pleasure. `
`That's why I have to go easy on her. `
`It's not as though I want to make her feel embarrassed and upset. `
`So I decided to be nice and change the subject. `
`Best not to be too obstinate. `
`"When you've finished your lunch, do you want to take a walk on the beach? `
`Maybe the clouds will clear up and we'll get a beautiful view of the sea." `
`"That's right. `
`I want to go see it." `
`"Yeah, let's do it. `
`...But...that cake really does look delicious. `
`Maybe I'll go get one of those too." `
`"You mustn't... `
`If you eat cake after eating so much, you'll get fat. `
`It looks like Hideyoshi-sama's blood is pretty thick in you, George-sama, so you'll get chubby if you don't take care." `
`"Shannon, you won't stop liking me if I get fat, will you...? `
`After all, I wouldn't stop liking you if you got fat." `
`"I-I didn't mean it that way... `
`If you don't take good care of your body, it'll be bad for your health... `
`au." `
`"Mother warns me all the time too. `
`I wonder if I'll have to take up Tai-chi-quan or something like she does and get some exercise." `
`"When going on a diet, it's better to start by rethinking your eating habits, rather than just exercising all the time. `
`Apparently, the exercise only helps if you're eating well first." `
`"In other words, you're telling me to hold off on the cake, huh? `
`Then, I guess I'll just have to gaze at you while you stuff your cheeks with it, Shannon." `
`"Uh, `
`umm, `
`......... `
`......A whole cake is probably too much, `
`......but maybe just half of one would be okay. `
`Here, it's really delicious." `
`Shannon cut her own cake and tried to move half to my dessert plate. `
`I had no doubt that she wanted to share the delicious cake's flavor with me. `
`However, I meanly pulled my plate away from her. `
`She blinked in surprise. `
`She could't seem to figure out if I was refusing the cake or not. `
`So I winked, opened my mouth, and said "aah". `
`"*giggle* `
`So that's what you really wanted. `
`......Sheesh, you're such a pampered child, George-sama. `
`"Okay, `
`say "aah"." `
`With a partly embarrassed, partly exasperated face, Shannon offered the cake to me with a fork. `
`*chomp* `
`It tasted like a cheap chocolate cake you might find anywhere. `
`And yet, it was exceptional. `
`Because eating cake in such an embarrassing way, as if we were a couple of perfect fools, had been my dream for many years. `
`It made this cake's flavor heavenly... `
`If the Earth is destined to end, I wouldn't have any regrets if it happened right now. `
`......It was such a moment of bliss. `
`After that, we gathered shells, ran from waves, and enjoyed each other's company while walking along the beach. `
`In the end, the clouds never parted. `
`However, we both believed that the sea reflected in our eyes was a deep blue. `
`"......Somehow, I'm so happy... `
`that it scares me." `
`"You do say that from time to time. `
`What is it you're afraid of?" `
`"...I'm... `
`...a servant of the Ushiromiya family. `
`For someone like me...to be walking like this with a member of the family... `
`Umm, `
`.........it just felt like it was too much for me." `
`"I'm also surprised. `
`I didn't just meet you yesterday or today, Shannon-chan. `
`We've known each other for years now. `
`However, we can only meet during those family meetings that only happen a few times a year. `
`...Back then, I couldn't even imagine having the sort of relationship where I could spend time with you like this. `
`It was the same for you too, right?" `
`"Uh, `
`......I... `
`...umm..." `
`"Hmm?" `
`"......I did... `
`...imagine. `
`No, uh, I mean...! `
`Maybe I should call it... `
`...a kind of daydream...... `
`I did think about what it'd be like, being in a relationship with you, a boy who was always so gentlemanly and considerate... `
`umm, though it was only ever a fantastic daydream......" `
`"Then, we must have your believing heart to thank for our relationship. `
`Magic dwells in the power of love. `
`So, I'm sure that magic brought us together." `
`".........You're right. `
`...I really do think......it was magic." `
`"But, you know, that's not actually true. `
`As you kept looking more and more beautiful every year, you became a larger and larger presence in my mind too. `
`If the same thing happened to you, `
`then the fact that we're here today is simply an inevitable consequence, rather than something caused by magic or a miracle." `
`"...............No. `
`A miracle did happen, `
`George-sama." `
`She stopped walking down the beach, gazing out beyond the sea. `
`" ......A miracle?" `
`"No, it was magic. `
`...It happened." `
`I was bewildered by that slightly mysterious phrase, which I sometimes heard her use. `
`"......Magic, you say?" `
`"Yes, magic. `
`.........I doubt you'd believe me if I explained, so I won't. `
`But...this bit of magic definitely had the power to grant the miracle that brought us together." `
`"Are you talking about some kind of ritual?" `
`"Yeah, `
`you might call it something like that. `
`...Except that it really was magic, not just some ritual." `
`"...Hmm?" `
`Maybe it's all girls, not just Shannon, who tend to treat encounters as miracles or coincidences. `
`For a man like me, an encounter with a girl is 70% hard work to try and make her like you, 20% courage, `
`and 10% coincidence. `
`The part that means everything to her...is a much smaller factor in my mind. `
`...Maybe that way of thinking itself is calculating and typical of men. `
`But if I said that out loud, it might dissolve all kinds of magic. `
`To my mind, there were lots of coincidences, compromises, and expended effort on both sides before we gained the relationship we have today. `
`At the culmination of all that, we get to spend this joyful time together, `
`and if she wants to call that magic, I've got no objections to her choice of words. `
`So I'll stand up for that magic. `
`"You're right. `
`......If the same fate were repeated a hundred times, maybe you and I could get into a relationship like this only one of those times. `
`In the other instances, even though we'd be aware of each other, maybe we would've only maintained a reserved relationship after all this time. `
`From the perspective of those other 'me's and 'you's, you and I are undoubtedly in a miraculous relationship right now." `
`"That's not what I meant... `
`......It really was magic. `
`...No matter how often you tell men something like this, they'll never believe it. `
`Kanon-kun didn't believe me at all either." `
`"...I believe you. `
`......I'd hate for the magic to fade away because I didn't believe in it." `
`"George-sama..." `
`In a small voice, I apologized for saying something that trivialized her magic. `
`Shannon seemed to be glad to hear me say that. `
`After all, if two people believe in the magic of love, it becomes eternal. `
`"Oh, that's right. `
`I was wondering if you'd be willing to agree to a little whim of mine." `
`"...Yes? `
`What is it?" `
`"You call me "George-sama", right? `
`It's not that I dislike it, but would you consider not calling me that anymore?" `
`"Of course, you have to keep up your appearance with the Ushiromiya family, so I wouldn't force you to do so during your everyday routine on Rokkenjima. `
`But, when we're alone, I'd rather you didn't call me that. `
`Yeah, let's make that a rule." `
`"A-A rule? `
`Wh-What would happen if I violated that rule...?" `
`"Hmm... `
`Maybe we should have some kind of punishment game if you break the rule. `
`...Yes, what should it be... `
`......Wanna hear?" `
`"N-No, I don't want to hear..." `
`"Ahahahahahaha. `
`I'll have to think about what it should be." `
`"Okay, `
`......George `
`...san." `
`"...Yeah. `
`I love the way that sounds. `
`I'm so happy, `
`Shannon." `
`"I, `
`I also... `
`...have another name. `
`......It's Sayo." `
`"I see. `
`The rule's gotta be fair, after all. `
`I'll follow it too, and from now on, I'll call you Sayo. `
`Okay, `
`Sayo...?" `
`"Y-Yes." `
`I held her shoulder and drew her close. `
`When I forcefully pulled her delicate body towards me, she dove into my chest like a doll. `
`As I held her head in my arms, we both looked at the horizon. `
`"What a deep blue sea. `
`I'm so happy we got to look at this sea, just the two of us." `
`"......Me too. `
`I'm so glad to have a chance to look at this deep blue sea with you." `
`As we gazed at the gray sea and a light rain began to sprinkle down, `
`we kept listening to each other's heartbeats. `
`The sound of waves flows into my ears. `
`...No, it's the sound of an enraged sea. `
`My body, bathed in painfully cold splashes, does not allow me to forget. `
`It won't let me forget the memories of the day my old fate was broken and smashed. `
`Once, tomorrows were literally like looking into a mirror. `
`All I ever saw there was the person I already was. `
`......Tomorrow was absolutely no different from today. `
`That was my old fate. `
`...But then, for the first time, I saw a different fate beyond the mirror. `
`The witch whispers to me. `
`She tempts me to take a bite out of the fruit of knowledge. `
`She torments me, saying I'll be furniture as long as I stay in God's paradise. `
`So I decided to choose the path of knowing love...and tried to become a person. `
`...Those days were like sweet honey, `
`...but at the time, I didn't realize that they'd be the start of a new kind of suffering... `
`I've arrived at a small island on a motorboat I've only just learned how to use. `
`No, this can hardly be called a small island. `
`It's little more than a rock jutting out of the water. `
`On this rock...is a torii and a small shrine. `
`It was probably built to worship the guardian deity of Rokkenjima. `
`......Even though I don't know exactly what it signifies, I know it has to be something holy. `
`Even in a place like this, I've got to take just one more look around, to see if there's anyone who might get mad at me for coming. `
`......I see nothing but the stormy ocean, Niijima looming in the distance, and the waves breaking against Rokkenjima's steep cliffside. `
`I ready myself, `
`...timidly approach the small shrine, `
`...and take the mirror that lies there as an offering. `
`The mirror looks old, cloudy and dirty. `
`...That would probably make any normal mirror seem horribly cheap. `
`...However, since the mirror's been placed in this small shrine, its appearance seems to give some sort of divine quality to it. `
`......And there's one thing I can tell. `
`This is no simple mirror. `
`...It may seem like an old, battered mirror to a non-believer like myself, but it has a great significance. `
`......Is it really okay to break this after being captivated by honeyed words? `
`......No, this isn't really a mirror. `
`...This is the life I couldn't escape until today, my fate. `
`I'll break it. `
`I'll smash it...and seize the life that lies beyond this mirror. `
`If I don't smash it, my life will be a pair of facing mirrors forever. `
`Nothing will ever change in the slightest... `
`The witch whispers to me. `
`She tempts me to take a bite of the fruit of knowledge. `
`Or maybe I've already tasted of that fruit. `
`After all, I've already experienced those maddening emotions. `
`Just as Adam and Eve felt compelled to pluck their fig leaves... `
`I can no longer... `
`...go on without breaking this mirror. `
`I've struggled with conflicting emotions for many days before this moment. `
`Inside my heart, the virtuous part of me kept on fighting the part that sides with the witch. `
`And now, here I am. `
`Did the part of me that's here right now...win or lose? `
`There's only one thing I know. `
`To obtain something, you must be ready to lose something. `
`Cowards who don't risk anything, who never try to change anything, ...will never be given the key that opens the path to a new future. `
`That key is already in my hands. `
`And that key is...to break this. `
`To smash it. `
`Is there any other effort I can make, as furniture imprisoned in Rokkenjima? `
`No. `
`This is the only way for me. `
`Come, have courage. `
`I'll free myself from being mere furniture. `
`And by accepting a new kind of suffering, I'll become human. `
`This is surely a small...yet large trial I must impose on myself. `
`Now, `
`......break it. `
`I'll smash to pieces...the eternally unchanging fate that imprisons me...! `
`I raise the mirror high... `
`...I think back on the days of conflict that came before... `
`...And, finishing my reflections in the blink of an eye, `
`... `
`I throw it down. `
`The thunder roars, ...crying out against me for my outrageous act. `
`...It truly is the hatred of angels trying to banish me from eternal paradise. `
`I look down at the mirror tumbling at my feet, broken in two equal parts, `
`...and after making sure I've accomplished my task, `
`......I scream up at the raging skies. `
`"...I, `
`I've kept... `
`...my promise... `
`......Now, `
`......it's your turn to keep yours, right...?" `
`Thunder roars once more. `
`...I've already been banished from paradise. `
`So I'll have to struggle on my own if I want to live. `
`The witch told me. `
`{i:That} is the single element of this world. `
`To lose it means losing the world. `
`...Like how a canteen with a hole in the bottom can't be filled, no matter how much water you pump into it... `
`"...I've kept my promise. `
`......Now, it's your turn to keep yours. `
`...Please, grant my wish, `
`{f:5:Beatrice}-samaaaaaa!!" `
