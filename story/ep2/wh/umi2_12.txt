`...Rosa and the rest returned from the chapel to the parlor in the mansion. `
`So many things had happened since early in the morning. `
`Of course they were high-strung... `
`Battler and George, who had cried, raged, and let their emotions explode after seeing their parents' tragic bodies, `
`returned to the parlor and sat in the sofas, dazed, as though everything up until then had been a lie... `
`Only Maria was completely unchanged and looked just like normal. `
`...When she wasn't playing pranks, she was basically a kid who played wordlessly by herself, `
`so even if she was dazed, she would probably look just as she did. `
`...But as she turned on the TV and flipped through the channels, it looked as though nothing about her had changed from normal. `
`Did Rosa think anything in particular about this attitude, which was clearly different from normal people? `
`...She stared at Maria's back as though looking at something that wasn't quite heartwarming. `
`Eventually, Kumasawa came to say good morning. `
`...Her cheerful manner was clearly out of place, and she couldn't help but be bewildered by the strange atmosphere in the room. `
`...Then, when she heard the details from Gohda, she reacted loudly with shock. `
`"O-O-O-Of course you've contacted the police, right...?! `
`What should we do in a time like this, oooh, what should we do...?!" `
`"......Please calm down and listen. `
`...It seems a machine somewhere was somehow done in by lightning last night. `
`Because of that, we haven't been able to use the phones..." `
`"Whaaaat?!! `
`Th-Then, until the typhoon passes, we can't even contact the police?!" `
`Maybe Kumasawa's exaggerated surprise was a little comical. `
`Even in this kind of situation, Rosa giggled. `
`...Because of that, the fog of confusion that had covered her head cleared up a little. `
`"......I've got to stay strong. `
`...It's not just Maria. `
`I'm acting as a parent for George-kun and Battler-kun too, so I have to stay strong..." `
`Rosa had been the youngest sibling, with a large difference in age between her and the others. `
`So, she had always been treated as a child. `
`Every time she learned something new, it was something obvious to her siblings, `
`and she had built up a complex, becoming convinced of her own incompetence. `
`So, she had developed a passive personality, asking her siblings for advice every time something happened... `
`......But she no longer had any brothers or sisters. `
`Now, Rosa was the only one of the four Ushiromiya siblings left. `
`...Furthermore, if Kinzo continued to shut himself away even in this extraordinary situation, `
`...Rosa would have to surpass this crisis as the Head's representative. `
`"......I'm not a child anymore, not a child. `
`............" `
`...Rosa slapped her knees lightly and stood up. `
`She must not wait for orders now. `
`...She had to start moving herself. `
`She picked up the receiver of the extension phone on the side table. `
`...Then she immediately remembered that the phones were down. `
`Genji and Shannon, whom she had sent to see Kinzo, hadn't returned yet. `
`...She had a good guess at what was going on. `
`He was probably yelling something nonsensical again and becoming unmanagable. `
`...His precious chapel had been defiled with blood. `
`That was easy to imagine. `
`She had planned on using the extension phone to call the study, but unfortunately, the phones were down. `
`Rosa decided to go to the study directly, with her own two feet. `
`Her old self would've been too frightened to go see Kinzo. `
`...And in fact, if she did meet him, she would probably be blamed somehow and insulted. `
`But this was no time to be frightened. `
`......As his true daughter, she had to make him aware of the current situation. `
`"...Kumasawa-san, `
`I'm going to see Father. `
`...Take special care of George-kun and Battler-kun. `
`...I'm sure they're on edge right now." `
`"Yes, yes... `
`That may be true... `
`...It is truly pitiable... `
`I shall make them something warm to drink." `
`"Thank you." `
`Rosa went out into the hallway and headed towards Kinzo's study. `
`The atmosphere in this mansion, which she'd spent her younger days in and should've been full of memories, seemed somehow different... `
`She began to climb the stairs in the entrance hall... `
`...Just then. `
`In the faint darkness down the stairs behind Rosa's back, ...something glowed. `
`It was a single, fluttering gold butterfly. `
`...It fluttered around and sparkled. `
`That butterfly danced about without a sound. `
`...It was only natural. `
`No one can hear the sound of a butterfly's wings beating. `
`......And then, ...it came to a rest on Rosa's back as she slowly climbed the stairs. `
`Rosa didn't notice it. `
`If someone not in-the-know saw it, they'd probably assume it was just single sheet of gold leaf in the shape of a butterfly that had been stuck there. `
`Without noticing a thing, Rosa continued heading towards Kinzo's study... `
`"......So, how will you entertain me with this next one? `
`...There are still many, many pieces left. `
`...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!" `
`In the parlor, which had fallen silent again, the only sound was that of the TV that Maria was watching alone. `
`If there was anything audible besides that, it was the sound of the rain, which had continued on and on since the previous night. `
`Every one of those who had witnessed that unearthly and horrible scene stayed silent, as though praying that the events of that morning had all been a dream. `
`Because Kumasawa alone hadn't seen it, her reaction was slightly different. `
`...The silence itself seemed more unbearable to her, and she was anxious to encourage everyone somehow. `
`...However, she was aware that she must avoid saying anything careless, and she seemed to be pondering how she could be most helpful... `
`Normally, it would be time for breakfast. `
`...However, possibly because something so outrageous had happened, Gohda seemed to have forgotten to prepare a meal. `
`...Or maybe everyone was so beaten up that they'd forgotten their hunger. `
`Kumasawa wanted to bring up the subject of what they should do for breakfast, but it didn't seem like the right atmosphere, so she really couldn't. `
`But she really was hungry. `
`...So, she casually made a proposal. `
`"...It seems everyone is tired after all that has happened. `
`...In times like this, I think the best thing is to heat yourself with some warm black tea." `
`"...Indeed, that is an excellent plan. `
`I agree as well." `
`"Hohohoh. `
`How about some delicious black tea with biscuits and jam? `
`Ah, yes, I hear Halloween will be here soon, and we have some delicious-looking pumpkin-shaped cookies on the shelf..." `
`"...Ah, Kumasawa-san, that's......" `
`Of course, she had said the wrong thing. `
`...She had reminded Battler and the rest about that horrible and tragic Halloween party in the chapel... `
`Nanjo hurriedly whispered into Kumasawa's ear. `
`"............" `
`"...Battler-san, I am so sorry! `
`...I didn't mean to upset you, truly I didn't..." `
`"No, don't worry about it. `
`......I'll definitely turn this boiling anger back on the culprit." `
`"......I wonder if that culprit is still on the island." `
`"Probably. `
`At least, until the typhoon passes, no boat will come." `
`"Y-Yes, that is true! `
`After all, the boats stop coming even when it's just a little windy. `
`They certainly wouldn't come during a typhoon, yes!" `
`"...It creeps me out." `
`"You think so, Aniki? `
`Me too. `
`......And that's even putting aside whether the culprit's that mystery guest or not." `
`"Indeed. `
`...We've naturally suspected the mysterious guest who calls herself {f:5:Beatrice}, `
`but we still cannot be certain she is the culprit. `
`...There is still the possibility she's a {i:victim whose corpse still hasn't been found}. `
`"...When I think of it that way, there's something I just can't understand." `
`"What...do you mean by that...?" `
`"It's simple. `
`It's just like Kumasawa baa-chan said a short while ago. `
`Right now, this island is right in the middle of a typhoon, and escape is impossible. `
`The same thing goes for the culprit. `
`......In that case, having the crime come to light should've been the thing the culprit wanted to avoid most." `
`"...I see. `
`...So, there was no need to draw that creepy magic circle on the entrance to the chapel and show off the fact that the corpses were there." `
`"Yeah, that's it. `
`And, if they were able to take the time and effort to do something so horrible to those six people, `
`it should've been possible for them to hide the six corpses where they'd be impossible to find." `
`"I agree. That brutal Halloween party probably wasn't directed at those who died. `
`...It was directed at the people who would eventually discover it, us. `
`It's probably safe to say that the magic circle was there to help us find it." `
`"...The culprit knows they won't be able to escape from this island for a while. `
`...And yet, they acted as though they wanted to make us find the corpses in the middle of this typhoon. `
`...What does it mean? `
`...If I were the culprit, I definitely wouldn't play around and make us find the bodies." `
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}-sama was not in her room. `
`...And the room did not seem particularly disturbed. `
`...Ah, no, Milady did disturb it quite a lot though..." `
`"...Come to think of it, what happened to Jessica?" `
`"Kanon-san is looking after her. `
`...They are probably in Milady's room." `
`"......That isn't good. `
`...The culprit is definitely still on the island. `
`...In this situation, I don't believe it's a very good idea to isolate ourselves in small numbers." `
`"Wh-What do you mean by that...? `
`Y-Y-You don't mean to say that the culprit plans to kill all of us...?! `
`Awawawawawawawawa..." `
`"Let us remain calm... `
`That is not yet certain..." `
`"But unfortunately, we can't deny that the possibility exists. Ihihi. `
`...This letter was in the chapel. `
`According to this, the culprit is the witch, `
`and if we don't solve the riddle of Grandfather's epitaph and find the gold, they'll massacre the whole family, ...or something like that." `
`"Is that true...?! `
`Umm, would you allow me to read it as well...?" `
`"E-E-E-Eeeeeeeeeeeekk... Eeeeeeeeeeekk......!" `
`"...Umumumumumumumu..." `
`As they read the witch's letter, Gohda, Kumasawa, and Nanjo's faces grew even paler than they had been... `
`Kumasawa could no longer hide her shaking. `
`"......If you don't want to die, try finding Grandfather's hidden gold... Is that it? `
`...Screwing around with us. `
`I'll bet she can't solve the riddle, so she's trying to make us solve it...!" `
`"However, ...I wonder what the truth is. `
`Madam always stated that the Legend of the Gold was nothing more than an illusion created by the Master. `
`...It is doubtful whether it actually existed..." `
`"True... `
`Supposedly, they thought it would be nice if it did exist, but only half-believed it. `
`...The relatives started believing in the Legend of the Gold only after Kinzo's health worsened and the inheritance problem came up. `
`Until then, hardly anyone believed in it, I understand." `
`"...Oh, so maybe that's why... `
`Do you remember? `
`On the table in the chapel, `
`...there were three gold ingots. `
`That alone would be worth quite a lot. `
`Doesn't that prove that the Legend of the Gold was real?" `
`"E-Excuse me, ...please wait. `
`Just now, did you say there were three gold bars...?" `
`"...Yeah, there were definitely three of them piled up. `
`So what?" `
`"Umm, uh, I......happened to hear Krauss-sama say something once. `
`...Yes, I just happened to hear it, you see! `
`It's not like I was trying to listen in on secret discussions, no indeed!" `
`"Don't worry about that now. `
`So then what? `
`Is there something wrong with there being three of those gold bars?" `
`"...Y-Yes. `
`According to Krauss-sama, ...there was only one bar ever found to support the Legend of the Gold." `
`"...That is correct. `
`I believe Kinzo-san showed the president of Marusoo a mountain of gold and let him take one bar back with him, or so the story goes." `
`"That one bar came to be in Krauss-sama's possession. `
`And, he said that `
`no other gold supporting the Master's Legend of the Gold existed..." `
`"You're talking about Uncle Krauss here? `
`So what does that mean? `
`...No wait, ...three?! `
`Wait, wait, where did they come from, that's too many, right?!" `
`"Perhaps there is another explanation. `
`Maybe the other relatives also found one each, and they each brought one of them there..." `
`"No, I cannot believe that. `
`When all of the relatives came to the mansion, I was entrusted with their luggage. `
`I did not feel a suspicious weight back then." `
`"...I think those would weigh about 10kg. `
`If that much weight was in their bags, even I would notice. `
`But it didn't seem that way." `
`"Same here. `
`At the most, there were some changes of clothes, a first aid kid, Kyrie-san's makeup. `
`Stuff like that, I think. `
`Aunt Rosa's luggage also looked pretty light." `
`"...In that case, those three piled-up gold bars were being shown to them...or maybe to us. `
`...The Legend of the Gold is definitely real. `
`It isn't an illusion. `
`They're telling us to try and find out the secret if we can." `
`"Could they be scheming...to have us solve the epitaph, which points to where the gold is hidden, and then try to snatch it away?" `
`"......Yeah, that does make some sense. `
`...But there are a couple parts that don't fit. `
`To start, our parents, who should've been the most likely to solve the epitaph, were killed first. `
`That seems to create a contradiction right off the bat to me." `
`"......And something else makes even less sense. `
`...If the Legend of the Gold is actually true, `
`{i:then how were they able to pile up all that gold}? `
`...It's almost like the culprit's already found the gold... `
`and is telling us to try and find it too." `
`"Maybe the culprit found those three like Uncle Krauss did. Maybe that convinced them that the legend is true, and they're trying to make us search for the rest... `
`I think that way fits the best." `
`"......... `
`...The pieces on the chessboard aren't lined up at all. `
`......We don't have a clue what the culprit is planning, what they want, or what they want to make us do. `
`......Is there any point? `
`No matter what we think, is there anything we can figure out right now...? `
`........." `
`"...Kihihi. `
`It was written down. `
`What she wanted to make us do. `
`Couldn't anyone read it? Kihihihihihihihihihi." `
`Maria suddenly laughed in a creepy voice. `
`...I'd thought she'd been concentrating on the TV, but apparently, she'd been listening in too. `
`Without turning away from the TV, ...she very simply told us what we were forgetting. `
`"{f:5:Beatrice} hasn't said once that she wants the gold. `
`...All she's asking is whether you're all capable of solving the epitaph's riddle or not. `
`...Though I'll bet she's pretty sure you could never do it. `
`...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi." `
`"...So, are you saying you {i:can} solve it, Maria?" `
`"...I don't care. `
`After all, she'll take me to the Golden Land. `
`So I won't get in {f:5:Beatrice}'s way. `
`Kihihihihihihihihihihi, `
`ouch." `
`"In any case, it looks like we'll have to ask Maria if we want to learn anything more. `
`...Maria, tell us. `
`......Who is this {f:5:Beatrice}? `
`What is she planning?" `
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi! `
`You know, {f:5:Beatrice} is a witch! `
`She can do anything with her strange powers. `
`The power of magic can do anything. `
`It can even create gold or bread. `
`And of course, it can create sweets too, right? `
`You saw, didn't you? `
`Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!" `
`"......hn?" `
`At that time, everyone jumped at the sound of a door being slammed shut. `
`When we turned around, we saw that Rosa had suddenly returned, bringing Genji and Shannon. `
`...Then, she rapidly approached Maria, her heels squeaking, and hit her on the cheek. `
`"...Stop talking about that. `
`Battler-kun and the rest will take it badly." `
`".........Uu-..." `
`Without waiting for a response, she hit Maria's cheek once more. `
`Everyone could only stand there, stunned. `
`"I don't know what uu- means. `
`What about yes?" `
`"......Uu-." `
`She mercilessly hit Maria's cheek again. `
`...Maybe Maria didn't feel like resisting after being hit twice. `
`She weakly said yes. `
`"...R-Rosa-san, there's no reason to be so harsh..." `
`"...This is my daughter's education. `
`Do not interrupt." `
`The atmosphere around Rosa, with Genji and Shannon standing at attention behind her, was somehow cold, and yet dignified, `
`...completely different from how she had seemed before she left. `
`She was holding something that looked like a gun. `
`...I couldn't imagine that she'd be holding a toy in this situation. `
`"Aunt Rosa, what is...?" `
`"...This is Father's. `
`Because of the current situation, I borrowed it specially. `
`......Everyone should understand. `
`The culprit is still nearby. `
`We don't know what might happen." `
`"......I agree. `
`...Rather than trying to figure out what the culprit is planning, it might be better to first think about our own safety." `
`"............" `
`"Father was fine, but he was considerably shaken by these sudden events. `
`...Fortunately, he said he won't leave his room, so he should be safe. `
`For now, we should all try to stay together as much as possible." `
`"...I agree. `
`We don't even know where the culprit's hiding, and...after all, there's no proof that there's only one of them. `
`......" `
`Even though I'd said it myself, I shivered. `
`That's right. `
`Could a single person kill six people and set up such a horrible scene all alone? `
`...Isn't it natural to assume that this crime was carried out by multiple culprits? `
`"...I agree with Rosa-san. `
`It probably is good for us to stay together." `
`"Yes, yes, I think it's good too, yes, yes!" `
`"......Maybe it's about time we called for Milady and Kanon-san." `
`"That's right. `
`...Let's have them come down." `
`George-aniki tried to grab the extension phone, but Gohda-san shook his head. `
`...That's right, the phones are down right now, aren't they? `
`"...I'll go with a couple people. `
`If George-aniki and Gohda-san come too, that should be enough." `
`"......No. `
`Let's all go together. `
`...It's a "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle". `
`{i:If we're in balance while gathered together like this}, then maintaining this situation will be safest." `
`"...A "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle"?" `
`"...Uu-. `
`I've got it. `
`I'll show you." `
`"Maria, turn off the television. `
`...Genji-san, `
`please tell me where Jessica-chan's room is. `
`Let's all go together." `
`"...Yes. `
`I will guide you." `
`"Come on, everyone. `
`We'll move together. `
`Follow my instructions." `
`We stood up. `
`Maria alone looked like she had some regrets about the TV, but she decided to go along with everyone for now and got up. `
`"...Shannon, thank goodness. `
`I was a bit worried when you took so long to get back." `
`"I am sorry to have worried you. `
`The Master ordered me to transcribe something for him..." `
`"Transcribe?" `
`"......Shannon." `
`"...I-I am sorry, excuse me..." `
`We headed for Jessica's room, with the armed Aunt Rosa and Genji-san in the lead. `
`Jessica and Kanon-kun were a boy and a girl of about the same age. `
`It'd sure be a shame if we barged in on them at a bad time...or at least that's what we'd be joking about normally. `
`However, Aunt Rosa was on edge, constantly exuding a sense of tension. `
`...So it definitely wasn't the sort of atmosphere for careless remarks like that. `
`"Hey, don't fall behind!! `
`Everyone move together! `
`We don't know when or where the culprit might leap out at us, right?!" `
`...No, maybe Aunt Rosa's attitude was more appropriate. `
`...Since Grandfather hadn't come down, Aunt Rosa was our leader. `
`This wasn't a situation where she could smile like she always did. `
`...And Aunt Rosa was a mother too. `
`She probably also thought that, if she didn't get ahold of herself, some harm might befall her beloved daughter. `
`The culprit had killed six of our parents at once. `
`...The method they had used was unknown, but there was a good chance this opponent could take down a large number of people in a flash. `
`Would that be with weapons, or with numbers? `
`...Or with the magic of a witch? `
`In any case, I couldn't think of any reason why it'd be okay to let our guards down... `
`The rest of us had better take much, much greater care, just like Aunt Rosa... `
`"......Everyone, stop!" `
`Aunt Rosa spoke in a sharp voice. `
`Wondering what this was all about, we peered forwards... `
`...and immediately realized the reason... `
`"......Wh-What is this..." `
`"Eeep......!" `
`"Everyone, get back...!" `
`Gohda-san and Genji-san approached the door... `
`Beyond this door...was probably Jessica's room. `
`"This...seems to be the same paint that was scribbled on the door to the chapel." `
`"...It appears so. `
`It seems not much time has passed since it was drawn." `
`"What the heck...? `
`...Is that...another magic circle?!" `
`"...It's the first magic circle of the moon. `
`...It has the power to open unopening doors." `
`Drawn on the door to Jessica's room...was the same kind of creepy scribble that had been drawn on the door to the chapel. `
`...That strange pattern must've had some occult meaning. `
`But it didn't matter what that meaning was. `
`We were worried about whether those two were okay. `
`"Th-That doesn't matter! `
`Are Jessica-chan and Kanon-kun safe?!" `
`"...This does not bode well... `
`We should quickly bring those two downstairs." `
`"Milady! `
`Milady!! `
`Are you there? `
`Please answer!!" `
`Gohda-san knocked violently and yelled, ...but there was no answer. `
`He gripped the doorknob with a clatter, but the lock just resisted him. `
`"...Rosa-sama, it seems to be locked." `
`"There's no helping it. `
`Please open it up." `
`Genji nodded, and Gohda quickly unlocked the door with the master key. `
`...In the back of my mind, horrible images floated up and disappeared, one after another. `
`...A magic circle had been drawn on the door to the chapel. `
`Behind that lay six coprses. `
`...So, if there's a magic circle drawn on the door to Jessica's room, ...then beyond it must be...... `
`"...J-Jessica-sama!!" `
`"Wh-What happened? `
`Is she there?!" `
`"Jessica!! `
`What happened?!!" `
`...It was truly heartless. `
`...The expression on Gohda-san's face and his cry as he opened the door... `
`prepared us for the brutal fate that Jessica had met even before we saw her... `
`Everyone rushed into Jessica's room at once. `
`...That scene told everyone that their worst fears were spot on... `
`"...Jessicaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!" `
`"......How...horrible... `
`...D-Doctor Nanjo!!" `
`Inside the room, which seemed elegant for the bedroom of one so young, Jessica lay crumpled on the ground. `
`There was a large pool of blood on the floor. `
`...And there was a knife or something sticking deep into her back... `
`...Was it a knife? `
`There was a design on the handle that just had to symbolize something demonic. `
`It had to be a weapon (?) with some kind of occult meaning. `
`"...This is......horrible. `
`...She has passed away. `
`...This probably reached her lungs... `
`...Not much time has passed since she died." `
`"Jessicaaaaaaaaaaaa!! `
`Damn it, damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!" `
`"...B-Battler-sama..." `
`"I was naive!! `
`I knew it!! `
`Since the culprit couldn't escape the island, they were definitely close by! `
`So why didn't I get cautious sooner?!! `
`...I was naive!! `
`I just assumed that a culprit would commit their crime and then just sneak away and hide!" `
`"...We were stunned then. `
`We thought Jessica-chan giving in to rage and running off was just something that couldn't be helped. `
`...But we were naive. `
`We should have stopped her...!" `
`"...Gohda-san, why did you leave those two alone?! `
`If only you had been with them, something like this...!!" `
`"N-No, ...th-that is...umm!! `
`I said it was dangerous, so we should return! `
`It's just that, Milady said that she wanted to be alone! `
`Kanon-san told me to leave it to him, and...! `
`...Speaking of which, where is Kanon-san...?!" `
`"That's right! `
`What in the world happened to Kanon-kun?!" `
`"...K-Kanon-kun... `
`Where......" `
`"Kanon-san should have been with Milady... `
`Where in the world did he go...?!" `
`"You don't think...they got him...?!" `
`"............ `
`Quiet. `
`......Someone might be hiding in this room. `
`Search under the bed and in the closet!" `
`There was a chance that Kanon-kun's corpse had been pushed away somewhere. `
`At Rosa-san's order, everyone searched throughout the room together. `
`...But there wasn't a single human hiding anywhere. `
`"...He's nowhere!! `
`Could the culprit have taken him out of the room?! `
`Then we'll have to search for him quickly and save him! `
`...If we're slow, something awful might happen!! `
`Aunt Rosa, let's search all over the mansion! `
`Let's search for the culprit! `
`Let's save Kanon-kun!!" `
`"......... `
`......Quiet!!!" `
`When Aunt Rosa yelled at us, we fell instantly silent. `
`She was probably contemplating something. `
`...However, what in the world could that be...? `
`...Aunt Rosa walked around the room as though looking for something, or as though she was collecting her thoughts. `
`......Then, she found something on the side table by the bed and picked it up. `
`"......If anyone knows, tell me. `
`...Which key is this?" `
`Aunt Rosa showed everyone a key with a cute mascot attached to it. `
`...Judging from its cute appearance, I didn't doubt that it was Jessica's key, but I had no way of knowing for sure. `
`"...It is probably the key to this room, ...to Milady's room." `
`After hearing that, Aunt Rosa made a point of going outside the door and checking. `
`......Without a doubt, it was the key to this room. `
`"......I wonder why it was set in a place like this. `
`Wouldn't you normally keep such an important key in your pocket?" `
`"...Umm, ......Milady wasn't in the habit of locking her room. `
`It seems she would only do it when she went to school, `
`because she didn't want someone like Krauss-sama to look inside her room..." `
`"......I see. `
`She wasn't at school, so it's natural that Jessica-chan would set the key down here. `
`How many keys can open this door?" `
`"J-Just the one Milady had..." `
`"Can't it be opened with your master keys?" `
`"...They can open it." `
`"How many master keys are there? `
`Are all of the servants holding them? `
`Are there extras?" `
`"Yes. `
`We all have one. `
`......As for extras, ...I wonder." `
`"There used to be several, ...but Madam scolded us harshly, saying that was careless, so they should have been dealt with." `
`"...That is correct. `
`There is only one held by each servant. `
`There are no more." `
`"...Hmm? `
`Wait a sec. `
`...I think we talked about extra master keys in the last game, right?" `
`"Indeed. `
`Well, regarding that, `
`I have noticed that having several master keys whose locations are unknown is quite disadvantageous for me." `
`"...That's probably right. `
`Since you wanna make me believe in magic using closed rooms, it'd really hurt you if there were more master keys than we thought. `
`...After all, every time a trick involving locks shows up, `
`I planned to resist by arguing that the culprit had a master key that someone lost in the past or a duplicate." `
`"Yes, that's correct. `
`So I've decided to make a move to defeat that. `
`...I'll update our setting." `
`" `
`{p:1:The only master keys are the ones held by the servants, one key each}. `
`*cackle*cackle*" `
`"...Messing with me. `
`...More importantly, `
`what kind of move is this? `
`...What's Aunt Rosa talking about?" `
`"*cackle*cackle* `
`Who knows? `
`You should try listening in." `
`"......Thank you. `
`I have the situation sorted out. `
`...And, I've been able to pinpoint the culprit who assaulted Jessica-chan, or at least one of their accomplices." `
`"Wh-What did you say...?! `
`Who is it?!" `
`"...Aunt Rosa, you don't mean Kanon-kun, do you...?" `
`"...Huh, ...what?! `
`Wh-Why Kanon-kun?!" `
`"This room was locked. `
`And the only keys that can unlock it are the master keys, held by each servant, and the key Jessica had. `
`...But Jessica-chan's key was closed up in here. `
`...Which means it's only possible that one of the master keys locked this room up." `
`"......It is as you say." `
`"In that case, someone killed Jessica, then locked the door! `
`That person had a master key. `
`And there are only five people with master keys!" `
`"O-Oh my!! `
`It wasn't me, not me! `
`No, I could never do such a thing!" `
`"...Kumasawa-san got up late. `
`After we returned from the chapel to the parlor, we did meet you there, `
`but it's impossible to prove where you were and what you were doing until that time. `
`You watched us from the shadows, chased after Jessica-chan and Kanon-kun when they were isolated, and stealthily attacked them." `
`"A-are you saying that I visited Milady's room, `
`and did something so horrible?! `
`I, I, I did no such thing! `
`Gracious no, no such thing!!" `
`"What about you, Gohda-san? `
`You said you left Jessica-chan in Kanon-kun's care and returned. `
`...But I wonder if that's true? `
`...Maybe you actually killed the two of them, hid Kanon-kun's corpse, `
`and then came back with an innocent look on your face!!" `
`"Nothing of the sort happened! `
`I, Gohda, swear that I did not do anything like that!!" `
`"...I-It wasn't us...!! `
`We were following the Master's orders and..." `
`"Yes. `
`You and Genji-san alone are clean. `
`That's backed up by what I heard from Father. `
`The two of you were in Father's room the whole time, transcribing and witnessing for him. `
`Father and I can guarantee that." `
`"......Thank you very much." `
`"In that case, the argument becomes who is more suspicious, Gohda-san or Kumasawa-san? `
`...I thought that myself right after entering this room. `
`......But still, I found it strange. `
`Look at the state of Jessica-chan's body. `
`Doesn't everyone think it's strange?" `
`"...Strange, ...you say...?" `
`"Jessica-chan was struck in the back. `
`......Come on, they say it all the time, right? `
`That in crimes where the victim is struck in the back, there's a high likelihood that the culprit was someone whose face was known to the victim. `
`She definitely wouldn't invite a person she didn't trust into her room...and defenselessly expose her back." `
`"...R-Rosa-sama, you don't mean... `
`...to say that was Kanon-kun, do you...?" `
`"I do. `
`We're all fully aware of the state Jessica-chan was in right before she was killed. `
`...After seeing her parents' tragic bodies, Jessica-chan was very panicked. `
`It's easy to imagine that, after she regained her composure, she'd be in a horrible slump." `
`"...It would be very understandable if Jessica's frame of mind led her to shut herself up alone in her room. `
`And those particulars match with Gohda-san's story." `
`"...Jessica-chan said to leave her alone. `
`...Then, Kanon-kun, who is of a similar age and who may have some adolescent relationship with her, said to leave this matter in his hands. `
`That feeling is also very understandable." `
`"......So, for that reason, I think Jessica-chan welcomed Kanon-kun into her room." `
`"But what if it had been Gohda-san or Kumasawa-san? `
`Would she have let them into her room?" `
`"...I-I believe that I have gained Milady's trust. `
`But even so, err..." `
`"Oh, then I guess you're still a suspect after all, Gohda-san. `
`I assumed Jessica-chan probably didn't like you very much, so I didn't think she would've let you into her room. `
`I was convinced that you couldn't possibly be the culprit, but maybe I was mistaken?" `
`"No, umm...! `
`......I am sad to say that I may not have been accepted by Milady. `
`...Wh-What about you, Kumasawa-san?" `
`"H-Hohohohohoho! `
`We are far too separated by age to understand the feelings of a young person like Milady very well... `
`And for the same reason, perhaps Milady never opened up her heart to us. `
`Right, Gohda-san?!" `
`"Yes, that's right! `
`It would have been quite difficult for her to open her heart to the likes of us! `
`And it would be inconceivable for Milady to let us into her room when she was grieving!" `
`Gohda-san and Kumasawa baa-chan each rubbed their hands together, affirming each other with forced smiles on their faces. `
`It was a truly unpleasant rondo. `
`"So, it was a person who might be allowed to enter Jessica-chan's room while she was grieving. `
`A person who might have been given access to her defenseless back, `
`and who had a master key. `
`That only points to one suspect. `
`...It was impossible for anyone except Kanon-kun." `
`"...P-Please, wait...! `
`Kanon-kun definitely wouldn't do something like-" `
`"Oh, then is there someone else? `
`Is Gohda-san or Kumasawa-san suspicious after all? `
`Who do you think is more suspicious, Shannon-chan...? Come on." `
`"I...I...could never......" `
`"It wasn't me, Shannon-san! `
`Yes, it was not me!" `
`"Of course, it wasn't me either! `
`The ones who had close relationships with Milady were Kanon-san...and after him, you, right?!" `
`"......Yeah, isn't that right? `
`...Jessica-chan might also let Shannon-chan into her room. `
`You were supposedly with Father. `
`......But in reality, `
`...could you be the culprit......?" `
`"...Sh-Shannon couldn't be the culprit! `
`Didn't you just say she was doing some important work with Grandfather?!" `
`"Yes, I know. `
`Neither Shannon-chan nor Genji-san is the culprit. `
`Father confirmed that they were together the whole time. `
`......Well then, what do you think, everyone...?" `
`After being told that, no one could respond... `
`Even if someone did manage to argue back, they'd then have to offer the name of a different suspect. `
`...And no matter who that suspect was, it would have to be someone right here. `
`...No one could do something like that. `
`Aunt Rosa glanced at everyone in turn, fingering the gun like it was a toy... `
`......She seemed so different from the kind Aunt Rosa I knew. `
`...No, it's probably because I'm not fully aware of danger we're in. `
`...Maybe Aunt Rosa's attitude would seem natural if I could truly sense the peril surrounding us... `
`"It looks like no one has an opinion. `
`Then I'll give you mine." `
`"Of course, I can't deny the possibility that Kanon-kun's a victim without a corpse. `
`But until we find that corpse, I certainly can't rule Kanon-kun out as a suspect. `
`...There's a chance he'll suddenly appear again, `
`claiming to have been attacked by the culprit and confined somewhere." `
`"But take care. `
`Most likely...no, there's no doubt about it. `
`...... {i:Kanon-kun killed Jessica-chan}. `
`"............N-No way......" `
`"...I-I can't believe it... `
`Kanon did that... `
`......to Milady? `
`...That's too much!!" `
`"I feel the same as Shannon. `
`I'm opposed to labeling Kanon-kun as the culprit." `
`"Then is the culprit Gohda-san or Kumasawa-san? `
`Tell me who's more suspicious." `
`""I-I-I-It wasn't us!!"" `
`"If it wasn't Kanon-kun, then who could've locked this door? `
`How about it, Shannon-chan? `
`George-kun? `
`...Huh? `
`Huh huh huh...?" `
`Aunt Rosa closed in on Shannon-chan and George-aniki, laughing unpleasantly. `
`...Of course, they couldn't say anything back. `
`They wanted to believe in Kanon-kun. `
`...But if they did, they'd have to suspect the other servants. `
`The simplest culprit was the mystery guest, {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`...But she was nothing more than a guest and didn't have a master key. `
`......So, if {f:5:Beatrice} is the culprit, despite lacking a master key... `
`...Then do we have to accept the argument that she really is a witch, who locked the door with the power of magic...? `
`"......That's a dirty argument... `
`...Dirty, ...so dirty..." `
`"What are you worried about? `
`Make it my fault. `
`You can just make it the fault of the 19th person, the mystery guest, right? `
`If you do, you won't have to watch this ugly battle of humans blaming each other, right...? `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"So then what? `
`The culprit is the 19th person, the guest {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`...She's a witch, so she could lock the door without a key, using magic. `
`Are you telling me to accept that? `
`Damn it...! `
`...Damn it, damn it...!!" `
`"...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* `
`In the last game, I learned all your weak points. `
`So, what will you do, what will you do...? `
`You said you definitely wouldn't accept me, right? `
`Then, ......you can use Kanon as the perfect sacrifice he is." `
`"Kanon killed Jessica! `
`If you support Rosa's theory, everything is settled here, right? `
`Kanon is already dead. `
`There should be no need to show concern for the dead. `
`And, you won't have to suspect anyone in this room! `
`*cackle*hahahahahahahahahahaha!" `
`"Damn it!! `
`I won't accept you!!! `
`But...Kanon-kun being the culprit...is impossible!!" `
`"......I don't want to suspect anyone. `
`...However, at times, "there's no smoke without fire" turns out to be true. `
`...Anyway, you can never be too cautious..." `
`"D-Doctor Nanjo, `
`...what do you mean by that...?" `
`"...Umm, please do not misunderstand. `
`...I do not wish to label Kanon-san as the culprit. `
`...However, until we understand the situation, there is a possibility that he's the culprit, `
`and I believe thinking that way is safer." `
`"...H-Hohohoh... `
`Yes, that's right, ...you cannot be too cautious." `
`The general concensus certainly didn't seem to find fault with Nanjo for what he said. `
`True, no one actually thought Kanon was the culprit. `
`...But unless they suspected him, they'd have to suspect one of the servants here. `
`...We didn't want to do that. `
`We didn't want to suspect. `
`We didn't want to be suspected. `
`"That's correct. `
`...We cannot be too vigilant. `
`I take it no one objects to that, right?" `
`"Understand? `
`...There's a very high likelihood that these murders are connected to Father's Legend of the Gold. `
`That means the crime must have been plotted by someone who wants to keep a vast amount of gold--worth several ten billion yen--all for themselves. `
`...With that kind of money, you could play around for the rest of your life in any country. `
`...And with a motivation like that, they might even intend to kill all of us." `
`"........." `
`"Because she didn't have a master key, the 19th person, `
`the guest {f:5:Beatrice}, is removed from suspicion for the murder of Jessica-chan alone. `
`But we cannot conclude that she's unrelated to the crime. `
`...After all, it's a vast amount of gold we're talking about. `
`We can't deny the possibility that there are multiple culprits. `
`...Right now, one of the people here among us might have been bought by the culprit!!" `
`As Aunt Rosa yelled, she looked all around, her gun still raised. `
`...Don't believe anyone, suspect the person next to you, ...that's what she was saying. `
`But no one wanted to suspect. `
`...They didn't want to suspect anyone here. `
`That weakness in their hearts demanded an answer from those not present... `
`"There are only two ways you can be sure someone isn't a suspect. `
`......If it's yourself, or if they're already no more than a corpse. `
`......The same goes for Kanon-kun." `
`"Until we catch sight of his corpse, he is the most likely suspect in Jessica-chan's murder!! `
`So take care. `
`Even if he's still alive, even if he smoothes things over with some explanation, you definitely mustn't trust him! `
`Got it?!" `
`No one gave an answer of their own initiative. `
`...However, those who met Aunt Rosa's eyes had to nod their heads... `
`Humans are beings who live by molding themselves to fit society. `
`...In other words, from the time they're born, trusting each other is genetically imprinted on them. `
`...It's...unpleasant to go against that. `
`They never want to suspect someone. `
`...But if they're forced to suspect someone, `
`...they find it safest to choose someone who isn't present at that moment. `
`For the purpose of safety and nothing more, they half-heartedly chose Kanon to be the sacrifice. `
`That's ridiculous...... `
`I definitely don't want to believe that Kanon-kun is the culprit! `
`I'd heard it from George-aniki just now, but not only were those two close in age, `
`they also had that kind of adolescent relationship Aunt Rosa had mentioned. `
`...It may be a little late now, but yes, they really did have that kind of air about them. `
`After seeing her parents' tragic corpses, Jessica, bearing deep wounds in her heart, would only have trusted Kanon-kun. `
`...It was very easy to imagine. `
`And that's why I don't like it...!! `
`Kanon-kun was the only one she trusted. `
`So, she wouldn't have let anyone but Kanon-kun in. `
`So, Kanon-kun was the only one who could've killed Jessica? ...I just can't accept that kind of argument...!!! `
`"...Understand?! `
`Even if Kanon-kun appears, don't let your guards down! `
`As long as we cannot prove Kanon-kun's innocence, we will assume that Kanon-kun is the culprit who killed Jessica-chan!!" `
`That was Aunt Rosa's claim. `
`By using the vague word "assume", ...she managed to convince everyone in the end. `
`Everyone nodded weakly, `
`......and, with the excuse that they were just assuming it for the time being, `
`......they "concluded" that Kanon was the culprit who had killed Jessica... `
`......I wonder what the dead Jessica and Kanon would think if they could hear this exchange. `
`Jessica...was crying. `
`...She was crying into the chest of the person who had put his life on the line to fight for her, Kanon. `
`It was frustrating. `
`So frustrating that it felt like her chest would explode... `
`She grieved and resented how far the dignity of the dead had been trampled... `
`"...How can...those guys treat Kanon-kun like the culprit?!!" `
`".........Because there's...no corpse." `
`"How can they treat you like the culprit just because there's no corpse?! `
`You risked your life to fight for me, right...?! `
`Then, ...that witch erased the corpse for fun...! `
`For them to call you the culprit after that...it's horrible, it's too horrible!!" `
`"...It's okay. `
`...I wasn't able to protect you in the end, `
`......but I was able to be of use to you in our final minutes..." `
`"...Why doesn't everyone understand that?! `
`Stop it, Aunt Rosa!! `
`Don't call Kanon-kun the culprit with that messed up logic!!" `
`"......She isn't saying I'm the culprit. `
`...She's just saying I'm suspicious... `
`no, `
`...she's saying to be careful." `
`"She {i:is} saying it!! `
`These people are saying you're the culprit so they can stop thinking! `
`They aren't thinking about who the culprit who killed me is anymore!! `
`They aren't thinking of the possibility that you aren't the culprit!! `
`And after this, every time something happens, they'll use the excuse that Kanon-kun did it, since we don't know where he is!! `
`...I can't stand that!!" `
`"......It's okay. `
`...At least you know the truth." `
`"If only I know the truth, that's pointless!! `
`I know it after dying. `
`Truth belongs to living humans!! `
`If the truth doesn't remain, the dead won't be rewarded!! `
`They won't know what Kanon-kun risked his life for!!" `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* Hahahahahahahahahahahaha! `
`Truly a splendid sight. `
`You hardly ever find a sweeter honey than the laments of the dead." `
`"Lament, lament. `
`No matter how much you lament, the voices of the dead never reach the living." `
`"Damn it, damn iiiiiiit!! `
`It doesn't matter who!! `
`Hear my voice!! `
`Kanon-kun isn't the culprit!! `
`Kanon-kun's corpse was just erased! `
`Why, why don't you understand that?!!" `
`"......Milady." `
`"...I can't stand this!! `
`It's too sad! `
`I hate it!! `
`This way...it's like Kanon-kun died for nothing, right?!! `
`The honor of the dead means nothing unless it's acknowledged by the living! `
`It doesn't matter who! `
`Notice it! `
`Notice it, please!! `
`Kanon-kun isn't the culprit!! `
`Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahh, don't go, don't go, everyone!! `
`Please, don't let it end like this...! `
`Don't go, ...don't goooooooooooooo!!!" `
`Rosa announced that this room would be sealed until the police came. `
`...The rest didn't want to suspect each other, so they happily accepted that. `
`...For now, they accepted that Kanon was the culprit. `
`...Without even imagining how much disgrace that gave to the dead, they accepted it. `
`"...Milady, ...you've done enough... `
`...Thank you..." `
`"Don't go!! `
`Don't go, everyone!! `
`I'm begging you, come back!! `
`Don't leave us behind like this!!" `
`"Don't...keep treating Kanon-kun...as the culpriiiiiiiit!! `
`Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!" `
`"It won't reach!! `
`The laments of the dead never reach!" `
`"You make me laugh, yes, that face of yours makes me laugh!! `
`Did you think your voice would reach them? `
`It won't reach, will it, Jessicaaaaaaa??? `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, wahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!" `
`"It's all useless." `
`"Huh? `
`......Battler-kun, did you say something?" `
`"Yeah, it's useless. `
`...{i:It's all useless}." `
`Just as everyone was about to leave the room... `
`...Battler stood alone with his back to them, still looking down at Jessica's corpse. `
`"What do you mean, ...it's all useless? `
`Do you have some objection...?" `
`"I agree that we've gotta stay on our guards, `
`...but sorry, I'm not buying all that about Kanon-kun being the culprit." `
`"...Hoh. `
`So you're speaking up at a time like this. `
`If Kanon wasn't the culprit, and it wasn't my doing, how do you explain this closed room that Jessica's room has become...?" `
`"......To be honest, I don't even have a clue on that point. `
`...Seriously, why'd I have to go and say it's all useless?" `
`"...Guess I'd better take responsibility for my own words. `
`Ihihihihi...! `
`......I'm empty-handed with zero weapons to argue with. `
`...But I'm not gonna sit around on the sidelines anymore, {f:5:Beatrice}!!" `
`"...B-Battler-sama..." `
`"...I-Is there some proof that Kanon-kun isn't the culprit...?" `
`The expression that rose to those two faces was definitely one of anticipation. `
`...They didn't want to believe that Kanon was the culprit. `
`They really believed in Kanon. `
`So, they were expectant because they wanted me to strengthen their belief in him even more! `
`"Then, Battler-kun, which of the other servants do you suspect? `
`Gohda-san? `
`Or is it Kumasawa-san?" `
`"Quit it, Aunt Rosa. `
`...I know the person called Kumasawa baa-chan well. `
`...She'll sometimes slack off while on the job, but she always makes things fun for people. `
`...Even if her eyes were dazzled by money, she isn't the kind of person who'd kill for it." `
`"...B-Battler-sama......" `
`"And I just met Gohda-san yesterday. `
`...Honestly, I still don't really understand him. `
`...But there is something I do understand." `
`".........I-I......" `
`"...I've never seen anyone who cooks as happily as he does. `
`...He's the same. `
`The same as Kumasawa baa-chan. `
`...Gohda-san likes to make people happy." `
`"As if a person like that could kill those who praised his own food as delicious, ...even if money was piled up in front of him!!" `
`"...Then, who do you think killed Jessica-chan, Battler-kun? `
`Who do you think shut Jessica up in a room that could only be locked by a master key?" `
`"Wait. `
`...Before I argue about that, there's something I wanna make clear. `
`I don't want to talk about, if so-and-so is not the culprit, then so-and-so must be the culprit. `
`...I just want to talk about how it's completely impossible for Kanon-kun to be guilty." `
`"You say you can prove that Kanon isn't the culprit? `
`*cackle* How?!" `
`"It's actually simple. `
`...And it's something I almost overlooked. `
`...Beato!" `
`"Repeat it!! `
`If you can say it, try saying it: "Kanon-kun had a master key on him"!!" `
`"............Hoh...!" `
`"...Kanon-kun doesn't have a master key on him?! `
`How could you possibly know that?!" `
`"A short while ago, I heard from Gohda-san about what happened. `
`...About how Jessica went to raid the VIP room, `
`right before she and Kanon-kun went off on their own." `
`"......Gohda-san, you did a good job remembering it. `
`You protected Kanon's honor." `
`"...I- `
`I... `
`...did...?!" `
`"I heard him say the same thing. `
`But I don't really understand! `
`Could you explain it, Battler-kun?!" `
`"...That's right. `
`When Jessica unlocked the VIP room, `
`she borrowed the key from Kanon-kun, {i:but didn't give it back}! `
`So Kanon-kun doesn't have a master key on him!!" `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`Is that really so? `
`True, Gohda has no recollection of the master key being returned to Kanon. `
`However, she might have returned it when Gohda wasn't looking! `
`How does that prove that it definitely didn't happen?! `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle* If you could just search the pocket of Kanon's corpse, you'd be able to say for sure, but you can't!! `
`It's impossible to prove!!" `
`"It's all useless. `
`It's actually pretty simple, isn't it?" `
`"...No way...! `
`So, you're saying that's why Kanon-kun didn't have a key on him?!" `
`"Yeah. `
`And to prove it, all you have to do is search Jessica. `
`...Kanon-kun's master key should be in Jessica's pocket. `
`Doctor Nanjo, would you check for us?" `
`"...I-Indeed." `
`Nanjo dashed up to Jessica and searched in her jacket pocket... `
`Everyone...was expectant......! `
`"...Mu..." `
`...Please. `
`Be there......!! `
`"...Here it is! `
`Is this it?" `
`"......Yes. `
`That is a master key. `
`Without a doubt." `
`At Genji's statement, there was a small "oooh" of joyful voices. `
`"That's Kanon-kun's master key. `
`......I'll say it again." `
`""Kanon-kun doesn't have a master key on him." `
`So there's no way he could've locked the door!!" `
`"...It certainly does...appear that way. `
`...But Kanon-kun was the last person to meet Jessica-chan. `
`The fact that he's suspicious hasn't changed." `
`"Let's...give that stuff a rest." `
`"...Huh?" `
`"Fundamentally, humans are supposed to be creatures that trust each other. `
`...But because we live in a tough world, we learn how to be deeply suspicious. `
`...So we suspect everything. `
`We're sad creatures. `
`...I won't deny that's our nature." `
`"......But the one thing I won't let you do is reach conclusions without proof!! `
`If someone looks suspicious, that doesn't make them guilty, it makes them innocent!! `
`Of course, the world is filled with wolves. `
`I'm not saying you should carelessly believe everyone!" `
`"But if you're gonna conclude that someone's guilty, you'd better have some perfect evidence! `
`Unless you do, don't go around accusing them based on speculation!!!" `
`"......Nnn... `
`That's......" `
`"...I was the one who brought up "there's no smoke without fire". `
`......That was careless of me. `
`I apologize." `
`"......Battler-sama......" `
`"...W-Wonderful reasoning, Battler-kun! `
`Thank you too, Gohda-san. `
`Because of what you remembered, Kanon-kun's been cleared from suspicion!" `
`"N-No, I...hahahaha..." `
`Clap clap clap... `
`...It was the crisp sound of the witch applauding. `
`"Well done, well done. `
`...Not a bad job." `
`"......Crap. `
`Did I fall for that bait piece just like you wanted...?" `
`"You magnificently proved that Kanon at least couldn't lock the door to this room. `
`The servants should all have had master keys. `
`With that as proof, Kanon was treated as the culprit, but you've at least managed to clear away that suspicion. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*." `
`"...In that case, `
`...how did the culprit who killed Jessica lock the door? `
`So that's the problem we have now. `
`Tch. `
`...I got drawn into exactly the flow you wanted..." `
`"I got you, didn't I...? `
`Furthermore, you said something outrageous about not doubting any of the other servants. `
`Well then, I can't wait to see how you try to smooth that over..." `
`"Shut up. `
`...Let's start right away. `
`You'll probably just deny it anyway, ...but first let's check the definition of this room as a closed room." `
`"Very well. `
`First, `
`{p:1:there are absolutely no types of hidden doors}. `
`{p:1:This door is the only way in or out}. `
`{p:1:The only way to lock this door is with Jessica's single key or the master keys, only one of which is held by each servant}." `
`It is on the second floor, but it is probably possible to enter or leave through the window. `
`However, `
`{p:1:the window is locked from the inside}." `
`"...I can spin the chessboard around already. `
`...If I start by arguing about the door and the lock, I'll probably be stuck dancing on the palm of your hand." `
`"Do as you like. `
`Well then, what should I repeat?" `
`"......Repeat it. `
`"Kanon-kun was killed in this room"." `
`"Very well. `
`"{p:1:Kanon was killed in this room}". `
`But I erased his corpse with magic, right? `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"Again, repeat it. `
`"Kanon-kun's corpse is in this room"." `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*! `
`I refuse. `
`I can't repeat it. `
`...Because I erased the corpse with magic. `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*!" `
`"Yeah, figures you wouldn't say that. `
`...There's got to be a secret hidden in there somewhere. `
`...Damn, where's the mysterious point I've gotta find? `
`......Did they lock it without the master key? `
`Or did they somehow kill those two while they were inside the room and it was locked? `
`Or did they kill those two, and then somehow escape?" `
`"...I hate to say it, but I'll have to cover up the moat first. `
`...Repeat it. `
`..."The last time it was locked was due to a master key"." `
`"I also refuse that. `
`*cackle*cackle*." `
`"...This refusing thing is really vague. `
`I don't know if you refuse because it's impossible to repeat, or whether you can repeat it and you're refusing on purpose..." `
`"Back when discussing the lock to the chapel, you completely turned the tables on me. `
`When I have an advantage, there's no need to go out of my way to use red when it might be risky. `
`That's all it is." `
`"......I guess that makes sense. `
`...Originally, the point of the red was to counter my strange theories." `
`"Naturally, I'll use it in a way that works to my advantage. `
`Now that I know I've got to worry about you twisting it around, I won't use it pointlessly." `
`"...*cackle*cackle* `
`Well then, what move will you use next? `
`I imagine a move placing suspicion on Gohda or Kumasawa will be easiest, yes...?" `
`"...Damn. `
`It feels like you're leading me by the nose, and it pisses me off... `
`Stay quiet a bit, I'm thinking...!" `
`"Of course, this door is the same as the chapel. `
`{p:1:When locked, it does not permit any form of entry or exit}." `
`"I'll say more. {p:1:No trick could have the effect of locking the door from the outside without using a key}. `
`*cackle*cackle*...!" `
`"Tch. `
`Damn you for always using red when I don't ask for it..." `
`......Time to step back to square one. `
`...For now, I've just gotta think. `
`I'll lay out everything I know. `
`First, there are two victims. `
`Jessica and Kanon-kun. `
`...Kanon-kun's corpse isn't here, but {f:5:Beatrice} admitted in red that Kanon-kun was killed. `
`So even without a corpse, he's included as a victim. `
`There are a few questionable points. `
`And depending on which I focus on, my line of thought changes a lot. `
`First, after the culprit committed murder in this room, how did they lock it? `
`If we assume the culprit's someone with a master key, it's extremely simple. `
`...But I'd like to avoid that if I can. `
`Because I'd have to suspect Gohda-san or Kumasawa-san...or maybe even Shannon-chan and Genji-san. `
`Here, I noticed something. `
`...I was contradicting myself. `
`I was strangling my own neck. `
`I want to deny {f:5:Beatrice} no matter what. `
`I want to erase the existence of that brutal, fickle, ridiculous witch! `
`So, I have to explain everything with humans, not magic. `
`...But that also means suspecting some human. `
`I don't want to suspect anyone. `
`...Of course, if there's some clear proof, I'll have to believe that the person in question is the culprit, `
`...but until that happens, I don't want to suspect people. `
`Am I just naive...? `
`Am I just a kid who doesn't want to have my feelings betrayed, when those feelings tell me that this person at least could never commit murder...? `
`I want to deny that a witch did it, and I also want to deny that a human did it. `
`......I don't even know what I'm doing right now... `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`In the first place, the only victory condition in our game was whether or not you could deny my existence. `
`...Even though that alone put you at a disadvantage, you've increased the number of victory conditions all by yourself, making your own victory harder...!" `
`...It's just as she says. `
`...If I just argue that someone with a master key did it, this closed room can be broken easily. `
`...However, the number of keys that can open this door is limited, `
`and since it's clearly known who has them, `
`using that argument means I'd be suspecting someone I know well... `
`...In fact, ...have I just been averting my eyes from the truth? `
`Even while attacking that closed room trick in the chapel, which was exhilarating to destroy, `
`I proposed that "someone stole the key from Maria's handbag and returned it". `
`If that theory's right, then the question becomes who could've stolen the key from her handbag. `
`...Maria's handbag was probably most unguarded while she slept. `
`......In that case, `
`......in addition to me, `
`...George-aniki and Jessica are also suspects. `
`So George-aniki or Jessica is the culprit? `
`Or maybe an accomplice?! `
`...All of our parents have been killed, right?! `
`And yet, ...and yet, ...one of us consented to that and assisted with the crime?! `
`We all lamented, mourned, shed tears together in the chapel. `
`...And yet, one among us...was lying?! `
`"...*cackle*cackle* `
`That theory of yours about taking the key out of the handbag and putting it back cast a pronounced suspicion on the cousins, did it not...? `
`And despite that, you acted like you didn't even notice, `
`announcing a theory like that so happily...! `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*" `
`"......D-Damn it... `
`That doesn't guarantee that one of the family or the servants is the culprit! `
`If you snuck up on us while hiding in a cardboard box, for example, `
`there's a good chance you could've slunk into our room when we were fast asleep and stolen the key, right?!" `
`"Hmmmmmm. `
`Perhaps that will do for that situation. `
`By suspecting the guest, the 19th person, you won't have to suspect the others." `
`"......In that case, how was Jessica's room locked? `
`It's no trouble at all for me to open the lock with magic, but of course, I don't have a master key. `
`If you deny my magic, you also have to deny that I'm a suspect, correct...?" `
`"So, in other words, that means suspecting one of the 18...!!" `
`"...O-Oh, yeah, thanks for the help. `
`...I've managed to sort things out a bit. `
`...My goal is to figure out how the 19th person, the Human guest {f:5:Beatrice}, committed the crimes. `
`If I do that, I won't have to suspect anyone!!" `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`If you can do that? `
`Foolish man. `
`...This wasn't a closed room from the beginning. `
`After all, there are a total of six keys that can open it." `
`"And several people possessed such keys! `
`You can suspect any of them! `
`Suspect as much as you like!! `
`But you went to all the trouble of denying all of them, making it a closed room yourself." `
`"......Understand? `
`This is a closed room born from your mental contradiction. `
`*cackle*cackle*! `
`You, and no one else, sealed that door." `
`"...So you're trying to say that I've got two options: `
`...accept that a witch opened it with magic, or accept that someone I know is the culprit. `
`Damn, are you trying to fork the rook?!" `
`"I just wanted to show you that moves such as this can exist as well." `
`"...*cackle* `
`So, what will you do, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeer? `
`Isn't it actually simple...? `
`Don't you just have to make sacrifices of that overly self-confident cook and that hag who wouldn't be a loss if she died? `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!" `
`"...............Damn it!! `
`If I suspect Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san, everything will be fine?! `
`That's useless! `
`......I can't think of Gohda-san as the culprit! `
`I can't think of Kumasawa-san as the culprit!! `
`But I won't accept you!! `
`No matter what!!" `
`"In that case, they'd have to enter the room without using magic or a master key, `
`kill Jessica and Kanon, and even erase Kanon's corpse without using magic." `
`"...How could it be done?! `
`How could it be done so that you can deny me, while still not suspecting anyone else?!! `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"......I resign." `
`"Huh? `
`Battler-kun, what did you say?" `
`"...I give up. `
`I was able to prove that Kanon-kun couldn't have locked this door. `
`...But that doesn't mean I've managed to figure out who killed Jessica." `
`"...N-No, ...that's more than enough... `
`Umm, ...for Kanon-kun's sake, `
`...thank you very much...!" `
`"...No need to thank me. `
`After all, ...this means you're under suspicion too, Shannon-chan." `
`"........." `
`"...And sorry, Aunt Rosa. `
`...It's not like I wanted to resist you. `
`I don't wanna die, and I want to find Dad and the rest's true enemy. `
`...Sorry for saying something that wasn't cooperative." `
`"...No, it's okay. `
`I was also a little rash. `
`Let's make up. `
`As an aunt and nephew, we have to stay on good terms. `
`......Right?" `
`Aunt Rosa shifted the gun to one hand and held out her other. `
`...I reached out, and for the time being, we shook hands. `
`Aunt Rosa's gaze was sharp. `
`...In order to deny the witch, she would sacrifice anyone. `
`...That's what her eyes told me. `
`And me...? `
`I denied the witch. `
`...But I wasn't prepared to lose anything. `
`I was probably the one who seemed to be fighting the most, ...and yet, the one who was most separated from reality. `
