`Every year, the relatives visiting Rokkenjima would let out a sigh of admiration at the rose garden that first greeted them... `
`They would stop there to chat about the roses' beauty and how well they were blooming that year. `
`In the midst of all this, there was a single unhealthy rose, and Maria became overwhelmed with dejection at its condition. `
`But George used his quick wits, `
`and, saying that everything would be fine if they took care of this poor thing, marked it with a candy wrapper and immediately restored Maria's good mood. `
`Then Battler, with whom she'd been getting along well since that morning, started talking about Halloween. `
`This was such a favorite topic of Maria's that she began playing around energetically again. `
`To Maria, that marshmallow jack-o-lantern candy bought by her mother was probably the greatest sort of treasure. `
`...They seemed to have bought several, and she demanded a trick-or-treat from every person she met, giving them candy instead of the other way around. `
`"I wonder why Maria likes Halloween so much. `
`I always figured it was a pretty unfamiliar event for the Japanese." `
`"Well, it's a kid's festival where they get to parade around in costumes, right? `
`It can be fun to play around in an outfit that's different than usual." `
`"Hmm, ...I think there's a slightly deeper cause behind it. `
`After all, she is the 'witch' Maria-chan." `
`"Come to think of it, when we were at the airport, didn't Maria say that if she was gonna wear a costume, it'd be a witch? `
`Does she like witches?" `
`"...Yes, she loves them. `
`So much that it becomes a problem." `
`"Hey, it's not so bad. `
`You expect kids at that age to love fantastical stuff like that." `
`"If it was just a heroine on some TV anime, at least it'd be cute... `
`...*sigh*" `
`Judging by Rosa's appearance, she wasn't very happy about her daughter's love for witches, as a mother. `
`The cousins other than Battler seemed to realize this, and they shrugged, wearing stiff smiles. `
`"Hmmmm? `
`So you're arguing that because she likes witches, she also likes Halloween? `
`If we don't know, why don't we just ask her? `
`Hey, Maria. `
`How are Halloween and witches related?" `
`As Battler asked that, George and Jessica let out a stifled 'ah'. `
`...As if they were trying to stop him, but too late. `
`Maria might have been waiting for just that question. `
`After beaming for an instant, her expression turned a little mean, as if to say "You're totally clueless, aren't you?" `
`It was the face of a hobbyist who's been ticked off by an outsider saying something stupid about their favorite subject. `
`"Uu-. `
`...To the Celts, the changing strength of the sun over the course of a year signified... `
`its birth, its growing up period, its aging and death, and then its revival." `
`"I get it. `
`In spring, the weak warm sun starts to grow up and get hot, `
`and then it gradually gets weaker and worn out. Sort of makes sense to think of it as the sun living out an entire life." `
`"Yes. `
`So, they thought that at the end of October, the sun died, was laid to rest in the land of the dead, and was then revived at the winter solstice. `
`And the name they gave to the last day of their year, when the sun ended its one year lifespan and died...was Samhain, and they celebrated then." `
`"It's an interesting idea, to think that the sun is revived on the day of the winter solstice, when the daylight hours start to grow longer again. `
`It's a case that makes it clear how much the ancients regarded the sun as sacred." `
`"...I see. `
`So, what does that have to do with witches?" `
`It seemed that my casual urging forward had slightly infuriated Maria. `
`She glared at me with eyes that told me to shut up while she explained. `
`...Maria seemed to be having a blast as she talked, so I decided not to interrupt... `
`"In the interval between October and November, life and death become the closest they ever will. `
`...The Celts believed that during this time, the world of the living grew closer to the world of the dead and otherworldly beings, `
`and many of those living in the other world would come to visit. `
`...It was like the Bon festival in Japan. `
`Kihihihihi." `
`At the time, people believed that souls returning to the physical world would go into people's houses or possess people and do bad things. `
`So, in order to avoid harm, they performed rituals. `
`One of those was to imitate creepy monsters and scare the souls back, which was apparently a way to avoid being possessed. `
`"That part became a festival, which turned into a costume parade. `
`...You really know a lot, don't you, Maria?!" `
`"...Ain't it the truth. `
`Even I never knew Halloween had such a history." `
`"But where did that whole trick-or-treat thing come from?" `
`Her knowledge was so extensive that the adults had suddenly started listening in too. `
`Maria, who was normally treated like the youngest all the time, puffed out her chest with pride. `
`Saying that this was just a kids' discussion, Rosa suggested that the adults go on ahead and set their luggage down in the guesthouse, `
`but nobody else agreed to go with her, and she let out a heavy sigh. `
`"Uu-. `
`Trick-or-treat is just for fun. `
`It has nothing to do with what was originally a Celtic ceremony. `
`That was created later when Christian customs were mixed in. `
`...However, I think it's right for Halloween to be that way." `
`According to Maria, the souls of the dead weren't the only ones who visited from the nonhuman world. `
`There were also spirits with intimate connections to people's everyday lives. `
`Humans could receive favors from those spirits, so they'd manage to gain magnificent blessings, `
`as well as a year's worth of good crops. `
`"So basically, Halloween was also a bit of a harvest festival?" `
`"I get it. `
`...Now that you mention it, I guess October's a turning point in all kinds of ways, including with the seasons. `
`Sort of the opposite of April in Japan. `
`...Yeah, that might be a good place to mark it." `
`"Uu-! `
`And also, the witches hold a witch assembly then, called a Sabbath. `
`The witches thank the spirits that give out blessings of prosperity and reward them." `
`"Halloween costumes imitate the guests that come from the other side. `
`...In other words, you might say giving out candy is a way to show gratitude for the yearly harvest." `
`"Uu-! `
`Just like George onii-chan says!" `
`"So Halloween is a time when those two worlds intermingle? `
`In other words, it's the most important chance for witches to intermingle with guests from that world. `
`Is that what you're trying to say?" `
`"Uu-!! `
`Just like Battler says!" `
`"And you know what? `
`You know what?! `
`October is when the power of witches and demons is at its most vigorous and prosperous! `
`Kihihihihihihihi, I'm sure Beatrice will come!" `
`"And then, we'll eat marshmallow candies together, and she'll bring me to the Golden Land with her! `
`We'll sing magical songs together, learn magic spells together, learn how to draw magic circles together! `
`And then, we'll learn the secrets of runes, and I'll become a great witch really, really quickly!" `
`"My, my, isn't that wonderful. `
`It's best for kids to have dreams. `
`By the way, Rosa, `
`how old will Maria be this year again...?" `
`"M-Maria, `
`...that's enough of that!" `
`"Don't worry about it, Rosa-san. `
`It's a dream all girls have at one time or another." `
`"Th-Thank you very much. `
`...But Maria has already graduated from that age. `
`...Hey, I'm telling you to stop!" `
`Rosa scolded Maria, trying to shut her up before her cheery discussion about black magic earned her the snickers of the relatives. `
`"Oh...? `
`That sounds pretty detailed and impressive. `
`...By the way, who was Beatrice again? `
`...Hmm, I know I've heard that name somewhere before..." `
`Battler had been gone for six years...and had completely forgotten about the Legend of the Rokkenjima Witch. `
`However, when he said he didn't know Beatrice's name, Maria's once-bright mood soured in an instant. `
`When he saw that, Battler immediately remembered that it was the name of the witch of this island, but the damage had been done. `
`...Until Maria's mood improved, she went on and on about many mysterious and fabulous episodes regarding the Golden Witch... `
`"That's enough, Maria. `
`Thank you, Battler-kun, for letting her chat with you. `
`...Kanon-kun, don't you have work to do? `
`Please leave now. `
`Gohda-san, it looks like everyone wants to set down their bags for the time being. `
`Sorry, but could you guide everyone to the guesthouse?" `
`"Certainly. `
`...Well then, everyone, allow me to guide you." `
`"...Then, if you will excuse me." `
`Gohda led the relatives, and they began to head towards the guesthouse. `
`They were eager to set down their luggage and take a breather, so they didn't realize that Rosa and Maria weren't coming with them. `
`After watching them leave towards the guesthouse, Rosa's face changed suddenly. `
`She let go with the hand that had been gripping Maria this whole time. `
`...There was a bright red mark there, making it clear how much excessive force she had been using on Maria's slender arm. `
`That hand then slapped against Maria's head, pinched her left ear, and lifted... `
`"Even though I'm always telling you not to talk about witches... `
`...Haven't I always said that was our promise together...?" `
`"Mama, ouch...Mama, ouch...ouch ouch ouch......" `
`"You really do like blabbering on about Halloween all the time, don't you...? `
`A festival for witches...? `
`Who cares about the Celts, black magic, all that idiotic trash...? `
`You're nine years old, nine... `
`Because of that scene you made in the train, I went to all the trouble of making a stop and buying you those disgusting monster marshmallows that look like they have fluorescent paint on them... `
`I went out of my way to buy it, even though it made us late. `
`How much more will you embarrass me before you're satisfied...?!" `
`As Rosa cursed, she twisted Maria's ear up, almost as though she was about to tear it off... `
`An expression of anguish spread across Maria's face while she frantically stood on her tiptoes, trying to soften the pain in that ear... `
`Rosa suddenly grabbed the candy that Maria had been holding. `
`She threw it on the ground and stepped on it over and over. `
`To Maria, it was supposed to be proof of a memory...of a brief span of time when her mother had bought something fun for her... `
`But now, that same mother was grinding it into the ground right in front of her. `
`...It was as though a brand had been pushed into Maria's eyes, leaving a mark that could never be erased... `
`"Who cares about this disgusting candy, `
`disgusting, disgusting...!! `
`It's because you're like that, it's all because you're like that!! `
`Disgusting disgusting disgusting!!!" `
`As she said that, she struck Maria's head over and over again with her palm. `
`...She didn't hit Maria's face. Because the red swelling would stand out. `
`Maria closed her eyes tightly, patiently bearing her mother's violence... `
`...No, that wasn't quite it. `
`"...Come back, Mama... Come back, Mama... `
`Save me, save me, Mama... `
`Defeat the bad witch..." `
`She kept bearing Rosa's assault, muttering that over and over... `
`"Didn't I... `
`tell you... `
`to stop... `
`talking about... `
`witches?!! `
`Why you, `
`you, you!!!" `
`Rosa, tired from hitting her daughter, breathed so hard her shoulders shook. `
`...Maria grasped her hands together, withstanding it, hoping 'her mother' would return soon... `
`"...Mama, Mama... `
`Come back quickly... `
`Save me, Mama... `
`Beat the bad witch..." `
`"F-Fine, just stay there like that forever!! `
`Just stand there, mumbling about witches and Halloween forever!!" `
`After hurling those words at Maria, Rosa left in the direction of the guesthouse, leaving Maria behind. `
`...Maria, forgetting even that it was okay to cry, `
`kept staring down at the jack-o-lantern candy that had been trampled beyond recognition... `
`"Oh, Rosa. `
`Where were you?" `
`"I'm sorry. `
`The roses were so wonderful, I just..." `
`"Rosa, set your luggage down quickly and come with us. `
`We're gonna go say hi to Aniki." `
`"Hmm? `
`What happened to Maria-chan? `
`Is she still by the flower beds?" `
`"...Yes. `
`It seems she found a rose she likes and insisted that she'd take care of it, refusing to listen. `
`I decided to let her do what she wants for a while." `
`"......We sometimes forget that girls have their own little world. `
`Sometimes, we have to respect that, right?" `
`"...That's right. `
`...Thanks for your concern, Kyrie nee-san." `
`"...Gohda-san, `
`where is our room?" `
`"I will guide you, this way. `
`Allow me to hold your luggage." `
`"I'll be fine. I can carry it myself, thank you." `
`Rosa went into her room, guided by Gohda. `
`She then closed the door somewhat violently and threw her luggage on top of the bed. `
`"............... `
`........." `
`She got down on her knees in front of the bed, ...burying her face in it. `
`For a while, Rosa made as if to shred the sheets with her fingernails, sobbing constantly... `
`"......Maria-sama, `
`...are you all right?" `
`Kanon appeared from behind a thicket after watching Rosa leave. `
`"...Kihi, ...kihihihihihihihihihi... `
`...I'm fine. `
`...Kihihihihi." `
`Maria gave a creepy laugh, but to Kanon, who had seen the whole thing, it looked like she was enduring as best she could... `
`"She's a horrible person. `
`I can't believe she's a mother..." `
`"...It can't be helped. `
`You can't expect anything better than that to enter a container of that level. `
`...I'm just fine. `
`Kihihihihihihihihihi......" `
`Kanon got down on his knees and picked up the trampled candy. `
`...It was tragic just looking at it. `
`He thought about dusting it off and returning it to her, but really couldn't do so with it in that condition. `
`Just as he was wondering what to do, he met Maria's gaze. `
`...No, that wasn't quite right. `
`Maria was looking at the candy Kanon had picked up. `
`...Right now, Maria's heart was surely the same as the candy that had been trampled into a pulp... `
`Kanon realized this, but didn't know what he should do... `
`"...That's right... `
`...I'll exchange it for the one I received earlier." `
`Kanon remembered that a similar candy he'd received from Maria was in his pocket. `
`Maria stuck out her hand. `
`...Kanon thought she was trying to take it, so he held out the candy, but Maria didn't try to grasp it. `
`...Then Kanon realized. `
`...She was saying 'Give it back'. `
`...No matter how tragic and trampled it was, this candy was Maria's. `
`...Her mother had bought it for her. `
`No matter how tragic, it had to be this candy, and no other... `
`If only it were intact enough that it could be fixed by dusting it off... `
`...Kanon hung his head. `
`"......Dusting it off is the most I can do. `
`......I'm sorry." `
`Kanon held out the miserable-looking candy Maria wanted. `
`She took it and spoke. `
`"...Thank you. `
`A Human can't do anything except dust it off, but a witch could restore it to how it once was. `
`It would be easy for Beatrice. `
`Kihihihihihi." `
`"............Maria‐sama, `
`...you know about `
`Beatrice-sama? `
`Except for Battler, there was no way anyone related to the Ushiromiya family could have failed to know Beatrice's name. `
`...But just now, Maria had bragged about Beatrice to Battler. `
`She had spoken almost as though she was meeting with Beatrice regularly. `
`Kanon felt a sharp pain inside his left hand, which was curled into a fist. `
`...In the past, a witch called Beatrice had appeared to tempt him and Shannon. `
`He'd always tried to think of it as a bad dream. `
`...However, Shannon insisted that it definitely was a real witch. `
`And then, this summer... `
`...The shrine to the local Shinto god was hit by lightning, disappearing without a trace over the span of a single night. `
`...He knew about Shannon breaking that mirror. `
`...And he remembered that, as the witch departed, she said she'd eventually be revived. `
`And now, ......this girl who believed absolutely in Beatrice...spoke as though she'd met Beatrice herself. `
`...Kanon couldn't suppress a vague sense of foreboding welling up in his heart. `
`For a while, Maria remained silent, as though she could see into Kanon's heart. `
`...Almost as though she was waiting for a memory of Beatrice to be revived. `
`And then, she spoke, as though it was a fact. `
`"Kihihihihi... `
`You know, I'm friends with Beatrice. `
`I'm even gonna meet her today and play. `
`Kihihihihihihihihi..." `
`"You're going to...play?" `
`"...Yeah. `
`Of course we'll play. `
`We're gonna study magic together. `
`Kihihihihihihihi..." `
`...The face of that witch, whom Kanon had tried to pretend was a bad dream, `
`...began to slowly creep into the back of his mind... `
`"Father says he's extremely busy with his research. `
`Unfortunately, it seems he'll be unable to come down." `
`"...Come on. `
`We've put this conference in our schedules and come all the way out to Rokkenjima during this crazy busy fall season. `
`You'd think Dad could at least be a bit more sociable." `
`"Yeah, seriously. `
`...Doctor Nanjo, `
`is it really his research and his mood that are the problem? `
`He isn't already bedridden, unable to get up, right?" `
`"...Well, ...I wonder. `
`There is not much I can say..." `
`Nanjo glanced at Natsuhi. `
`It seemed he thought it wasn't his place to speak without first getting Natsuhi's approval. `
`"Father's state of health is better than ever. `
`It would be exceedingly rude to call him 'bedridden'...!" `
`"But he only has three months left to live, right? `
`Normally, wouldn't you expect him to be wasted away, unable to get out of bed? `
`Isn't that right, Doctor Nanjo?" `
`"......For a normal patient, that would probably be the case. `
`But Kinzo-san has extraordinary willpower. `
`...Perhaps that willpower has frightened even the reaper away..." `
`"Well, if he's that energetic, then I guess we have little to worry about for the near future, right?" `
`"...Though, if he's got that much spunk, I wish he'd at least come to greet us. `
`...Isn't the whole point of this family conference to come and see Dad's face? `
`I'm not even sure why we came now." `
`"Don't say that. `
`If he were here, you'd complain the whole time about being unable to relax. `
`Shouldn't we celebrate the fact that all of us siblings have gathered this year to spend some time alone?" `
`"We didn't get to see him at last year's family conference either, right? `
`Can't you understand why his blood children might want to see him after two years?" `
`"...If there's anything you'd like to say in greeting, I will tell him for you. `
`Or, Eva-san, `
`...is there something you'd like to discuss with Father beyond merely greeting him...?" `
`"......Nngg. `
`...Come on, what are you talking about? Sheesh." `
`"Give it a rest, Eva. `
`Natsuhi-san, forgive us. `
`Eva's just worried about Father's condition, as his daughter. `
`Please try and understand how she feels." `
`"Indeed. `
`Look how quickly you've grown to respect Father, now that you know how much longer he has to live. `
`...Yes, I believe I do understand why you want to see him so much. `
`...Hmph." `
`"......What are you trying to say?" `
`"Quit it, Aneki. `
`Why don't we pray that his mood'll improve by dinner? `
`...Anyway, we've only just arrived. `
`For now, we're only here for a casual greeting. `
`And we could even hold the family conference without Dad. `
`...In fact, there's a few things we siblings shouldn't bring to him until we've formed a unified opinion. `
`Isn't that right, Hideyoshi nii-san?" `
`"Yep! `
`Just as Rudolf-kun says. `
`...This is the only time of year we can all meet in person. `
`We've gotta take this valuable time seriously and be frank with each other." `
`Even though the tea hadn't yet arrived, ...they were very determined. `
`"But before that, perhaps we can spare the time to enjoy some black tea at our leisure, `
`surrounded by the wonderful furnishings of the parlor..." `
`Kyrie's words seemed to contain a subtle admonition directed at everyone gathered there. `
`They all understood, and as they cleared their throats and straightened their neckties, the atmosphere in the room returned to normal for a time. `
`"...Excuse me. `
`I've brought some tea." `
`"Hey, Shannon-chan. `
`You just keep gettin' prettier and prettier!" `
`Shannon entered the parlor, pushing the serving cart. `
`Everyone decided to relax and enjoy some black tea for the time being... `
`A wonderful aroma began to spread throughout the room. `
`As far as anyone could see, the strained atmosphere from before Shannon's arrival seemed like a lie. `
`...Of course, Shannon, who was setting out the tea, probably didn't even notice. `
`...Kyrie seemed to laugh faintly at how 'adult' everyone was suddenly acting. `
`Rudolf didn't like it when Kyrie took the initiative and spoke at the family conference. `
`...It was his worthless male pride. `
`He probably didn't want to look like a weak man who took advice from his wife. `
`She understood that and did her best to refrain from saying any more than was necessary. `
`So, she separated herself from the circle of siblings, who only superficially appeared to be enjoying some time together alone, and casually drank her tea near the window. `
`"Oh, Rosa-san. `
`I thought you siblings were enjoying some alone time..." `
`"...You must be joking." `
`"Sorry, don't take it the wrong way. `
`I'm just a little exasperated by my husband." `
`Apparently, Rosa hadn't been able to keep up with that 'on the surface' friendliness. `
`...They'd come here to fight bloodily and dirtily, each trying to grab a part of the inheritance for themselves. `
`She probably didn't like suddenly pretending that they were all chummy. `
`...Or maybe she was still too immature for that. `
`"...It looks like the wind's started blowing hard out there. `
`...The plants are all shaking so much." `
`"The typhoon's probably gotten pretty close already. `
`...I wonder if we'll see a lot of rain tonight." `
`"......Maria-chan really has grown a lot this past year." `
`"......Does it look that way...? `
`She still can't even fold her own clothing yet." `
`"No, it's true. `
`It's because she has such an affectionate mother. `
`She'll grow into a girl with a rich heart." `
`Rosa fell silent. `
`......Maybe she was unsure as to what Kyrie meant by that... `
`"...I'm... `
`a failure as a mother. `
`......Children don't get to choose their parents. `
`That poor girl..." `
`"Doesn't that go both ways? `
`...A parent can't choose what kind of child they have either." `
`"..............." `
`Rosa bit her lower lip... `
`"This isn't a matter of assigning blame. `
`Isn't it enough that you take your time and watch over her as she grows, conscious of the fact that you'll be living together?" `
`"You spend every day with Maria-chan, so you probably don't notice the small changes. `
`But the rest of us, who haven't seen her for a year, can see clearly how much she's grown..." `
`"...If you really mean that, thank you very much." `
`"Then, if you will excuse me. `
`If there is anything you desire, please call for it at any time." `
`Shannon bowed politely and left the room. `
`As Hideyoshi and Rudolf, who had a soft spot for women, watched her go, `
`...the atmosphere in the room began to revert back to what it had been right before Shannon's visit. `
`"......If Father can't come down...well, that does still leave us with certain things we can discuss. `
`Right, Rudolf?" `
`"Yep, that's right. `
`...We didn't come all the way out here just to drink some dusty tea, right?" `
`"...Very well. `
`What is this matter that you're clearly so eager to discuss?" `
`"......My, my. `
`Those people really are determined. `
`They certainly got started quick." `
`"I need to join in too. `
`...If I don't assert myself, those people will quickly forget that there are four siblings." `
`"...Sounds like you've got it pretty tough yourself. `
`...Maybe I spoke too harshly. `
`Forgive me." `
`"No, I don't mind. `
`...I'm the one who should be apologizing. `
`As a pair of mothers with daughters, we should talk more often. `
`Every single time we meet, we end up talking about something shady..." `
`"...You can blame the atmosphere in this mansion for that. `
`Once you breathe in this air, everyone gets so strained. `
`...Just once, I'd like to have a nice, long cup of tea with you, when we aren't attending a family conference. `
`There's a wonderful coffee shop in Ginza that's a favorite of mine. `
`Please let me invite you sometime soon." `
`"Thank you, Kyrie-san. `
`That sounds great..." `
`"Oh, no. `
`The sky's gotten dark pretty fast. `
`I could almost believe the people in this room made the weather worse. `
`...There's already thunder. `
`Oh? `
`Was that one there...?" `
`"...Huh?" `
`There really were small splashes of rain on the glass of the parlor window. `
`...The weather seemed to have worsened faster than expected. `
`...Just then, a silent thunderbolt struck inside Rosa's head, and she remembered that her beloved child was out in the rose garden. `
`A normal girl would try to go inside if the weather got bad. `
`...But Maria was different. `
`She would sometimes get stubborn and refuse to move if rain or even spears fell from the sky. `
`...That's right, I... `
`...told that child...{i:to just stay there doing that forever}, didn't I...? `
`"...O-Oh no...! `
`Maria...!!" `
`Everyone looked back at Rosa when she let out a small scream. `
`"...What? What is it?" `
`"I-I'm sorry, I'm going outside for a second. `
`I'll be right back!" `
`"...What the...seriously, what's going on with her...?" `
`"Don't worry, she'll be back soon. `
`...More importantly, shouldn't we begin? `
`...Our main topic." `
`"That's right. `
`We can keep talking about that without Rosa. `
`Let's return to our discussion." `
`"............" `
`Rosa dashed from the entrance hall into the rose garden. `
`When she opened the door, the wind that hit her was too strong to be called a light breeze...and told her that the typhoon was approaching faster than she'd thought. `
`Just as Kyrie had said, the wind was mixed in with small droplets of rain. `
`There was also a low rumble of thunder. `
`...It could start raining anytime. `
`Rosa headed for the rose garden. `
`She headed for the place where she had scolded Maria a short while ago. `
`...It was almost lunchtime. `
`The children had been told to come to the mansion around lunchtime, `
`so they were probably in the guesthouse, waiting to be called. `
`...Even if Maria didn't come to them, they would surely think I took her to the mansion with me...and wouldn't worry much. `
`...After all, she had been with her mother, so there should've been no reason to worry. `
`I was here, and I abandoned my daughter to the worsening weather...! `
`"Mariaaa!! `
`Are you there?!! `
`If you're there, answer me!!" `
`"......Uu-." `
`I was right. `
`She was still standing stock still, ...exactly the same way she had been, in the place where I had scolded her. `
`Held in her hand...was the candy that I'd bought, given her, and then stepped on and crushed. `
`With that gripped in her hand, she stood there as the powerful winds whipped her hair about, tormenting her... `
`"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!! `
`Sorry, Maria...!! `
`Forgive Mama...!" `
`"...Uu-. `
`Mama, welcome back... `
`...I waited a long time for you to come back. `
`...The scary witch pinched me, but I stayed strong, waiting for Mama to come back without crying..." `
`"...Maria...! `
`...Forgive your Mama, ...forgive your Mama..." `
`"You didn't do anything wrong... `
`You were just possessed by a bad witch again... `
`So I'm fine. `
`I really like you, Mama. `
`I love you..." `
`"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!! `
`I'm sorry, I'm sorry... `
`...Please forgive your Mama... `
`...for losing to the bad witch......" `
`Rosa buried her face in Maria's small chest, crying and begging forgiveness. `
`...And once again, those tears dripped down after who knows how many times. `
`If only the brilliant sun had been shining on the two of them, `
`all of their cares would have evaporated, and it might've felt like they could begin anew. `
`...However, what surrounded the two of them was the worsening weather. `
`Sadly, there were only fierce winds with occasional thunder. `
`The sound of Maria sniffling brought Rosa to her senses. `
`...If Maria stood exposed to the wind for too long, she'd probably catch a cold. `
`"...Okay, Maria, `
`it's almost time for lunch. `
`Why don't you come back to the mansion with me?" `
`"Uu-. `
`Won't go." `
`"Wh-Why not...?" `
`Rosa thought she'd already received Maria's forgiveness, so she hadn't imagined Maria would refuse. `
`But that expression on Maria's face didn't look like that of a child resisting her mother. `
`...So Rosa couldn't understand why Maria wanted to stand still, pointlessly, as the weather grew even worse. `
`Maria answered that question... `
`"It's Beatrice. `
`She'll be here really soon. `
`So I'm waiting." `
`"......Maria..." `
`Rosa struggled to find words for a moment, then fell silent. `
`...They'd only just managed to make up, after all. `
`She chose her words carefully, trying to get Maria to come with her to the mansion without denying the witch outright. `
`"...Beatrice is... `
`coming?" `
`"Uu-!" `
`"Really...? `
`Then instead of waiting here, why don't we wait in the mansion? `
`If you stay in this wind too long, you'll catch a cold..." `
`"She'll come! `
`Beatrice will come!! `
`And when she does, I'll give her candy. `
`I'll do trick-or-treat! `
`I'll give her a jack-o-lantern marshmallow candy and say <Happy Halloween>!! `
`Uu-!!" `
`Maria pulled yet another sweet out of her handbag, moaning uu-uu-. `
`Rosa was bewildered and didn't know what to do...as Maria started being difficult again... `
`At that time, there was a sudden blast of thunder. `
`It was probably a sign. `
`...A sign that this island had been sealed off by the storm, detached from common sense and reality. `
`So, after this moment, all common sense would probably cease to apply. `
`The wind blew even stronger, and amidst that blizzard of scattered rose petals, `
`...a figure appeared, leaving Rosa unable to imagine that this was a scene from reality. `
`...It was probably...no, definitely...fantastical. `
`After all, that shadow of a person was...... `
`"Beatrice!!" `
`Maria dashed over to the shadow. `
`...Normally, Rosa would scold her daughter if she dashed over to someone whom she hadn't seen before and didn't know. `
`...But Rosa forgot to do that, was unable to do anything but stand there, stunned. `
`"...It's been quite some time. `
`Have you been well?" `
`"Uu-! `
`I've been well! `
`Witches don't catch colds! `
`Uu-!!" `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`Indeed, a witch can use curses to make people catch colds, ...but how foolish would it be if she caught one herself? `
`From now on, you should take care not to catch something like a cold yourself." `
`She patted Maria's head as she said this, smiling roguishly... `
`Rosa couldn't have known the name of the woman who was happily spoiling Maria. `
`...However, Maria had called it out in the beginning when the woman appeared. `
`So, even though Rosa had never met her, even though the woman still hadn't introduced herself, Rosa was able to know her name. `
`......However, that name held a special meaning on Rokkenjima and in the Ushiromiya family. `
`...There's no way something that stupid could be...! `
`"Beatrice! `
`<Happy Halloween>! `
`Look at what we bought! `
`I'll give you one too, Beatrice. `
`Uu-!" `
`"Indeed, <Happy Halloween>. `
`Hoh, is this for me? `
`How truly adorable, that a candy would be made out of this, the lonely light of a man lost in the darkness of Purgatory, unable to go to heaven or hell." `
`"...Right now, on this island that has been cut off both from the world of humans and the world of nonhumans, `
`there may be no more suitable sweet. `
`*cackle*cackle*...!" `
`"......Hmm? `
`Maria, what's wrong with that one?" `
`The witch noticed the sweet Maria was grasping. `
`...It was Maria's candy, which had been stomped on by Rosa until it reached this pitiful state. `
`"...Uu-. `
`Got stepped on and smashed. `
`...Can you fix it, Beato...?" `
`Maria didn't go so far as to say that it was her mother who'd stepped on it. `
`However, for some reason, when the witch saw that candy, she looked at Rosa and grinned. `
`...A chill went down Rosa's spine, as though this gaze was staring straight through her. `
`"It shall be easy. `
`Give it to me." `
`"Uu-!" `
`Maria held the candy out gleefully. `
`...Rosa could do nothing but watch, stunned. `
`...How did this person plan to trick Maria, somehow undoing the fact that the candy had been pitifully trampled...? `
`Maria looked as though she believed it could be fixed good as new. `
`...Without real 'magic', there was no way such a thing could be possible...! `
`"My, my, it is quite crushed, isn't it? `
`...Come, Maria. `
`Close your eyes and try to remember." `
`"Because it really was that wonderful a candy. `
`The candy of your memories is always full and fluffy. `
`So you try to remember as well. `
`What kind of candy was it really{p:0:♪}" `
`...Along with those strange words, spoken as though singing an improvised folk song, the witch threw the sweet into the air. `
`Maria was closing her eyes and remembering, just as the witch had told her to. `
`...What shape had that crushed candy really had? `
`Therefore, only Rosa saw that scene. `
`The sweet that had been thrown into the air...burst into a gold color...no, that wasn't it. `
`Those were golden butterflies. `
`It scattered into several golden butterflies, ...and they began to gather at the witch's hand, which was held up to the sky. `
`And as she did this, ......unbelievably, ......it returned to its beautiful original form, no different from when it had been bought... `
`Only Rosa and the witch witnessed that scene. `
`Unable to comprehend what was occurring right before her eyes, Rosa stood with her mouth hanging open, completely forgetting to shut it... `
`"You may now open your eyes. `
`Take it. `
`With this, your sweet has returned to normal." `
`"Uu-!! `
`Beatrice is always incredible, incredible, *giggle*!!" `
`"..............." `
`There was a stark contrast between Rosa's shock and Maria's innocent joy. `
`...Was that what the witch was laughing at? `
`A smile floated to Beatrice's face, one different from the smile she'd shown Maria. `
`"...Does my face seem familiar? `
`If you stare so fixedly, you might burn a hole through it." `
`"Umm...ah, I-I'm sorry...!" `
`Those words triggered something very clearly in Rosa's mind. `
`...Rosa knew this face. `
`......She knew it from the portrait of the witch. `
`But...no, wait, ...could this mystery woman really be...?! `
`"...Maria, `
`I give you this in exchange for the sweet you gave me." `
`"Uu-...? `
`A letter?" `
`The witch pulled a Western envelope from her pocket and gave it to Maria. `
`However, when Maria made to open it, the witch stopped her. `
`"You must not. `
`The time will soon come for you to open it, but until then, you absolutely must not. `
`Take good care of it. `
`That will be your invitation to the Golden Land." `
`"The Golden Land!! `
`So you'll finally take me there!! `
`*giggle*! `
`*giggle*!!" `
`"Take it and treat it with care. `
`You must not show it to anyone." `
`"Uu-! `
`I'll keep that promise! `
`You've always gotta keep promises with witches!" `
`"...And this is for you." `
`"Huh......? `
`...M-Me...?!" `
`She probably hadn't imagined that the witch would speak to her, too. `
`Rosa was bewildered by the second Western envelope, which was thrust before her. `
`She'd seen this type of envelope before. `
`...There could be no mistake. `
`It was one of Kinzo's special envelopes, used when he wrote with his own hand and bearing the Ushiromiya family crest. `
`It was sealed with red sealing wax, `
`...and furthermore, it had a mark that seemed to have been made by the Head's Ring. `
`In other words, even without asking what was inside this letter, `
`...Rosa knew that this woman, whom Maria called Beatrice, `
`was trusted enough to be placed in charge of a personal letter of the current Ushiromiya Head...! `
`"It could have been any of the four siblings. `
`However, the fact that I have met you here probably means that you were chosen by Kinzo's roulette. `
`...So take it. `
`Then read its contents aloud while seated at the dinner table, when all of the siblings are gathered." `
`"......What did you say...?" `
`Rosa looked back and forth several times between the witch's face and the envelope that had been handed to her. `
`Today was the family conference, and the biggest object of discussion would be the inheritance problem. `
`...So, she had joined together with Eva and Rudolf, `
`and they planned to force a certain condition on Krauss to try and extort several hundred million yen in cash out of him. `
`It was as if the witch could see through all of that. `
`...What does she intend to announce...when all of us siblings are gathered? `
`And with a personal envelope that no one but the Ushiromiya Head can use...! `
`"...Maria, `
`the weather is getting worse. `
`Return to the guesthouse and wait for lunchtime. `
`...And Rosa, we will meet again later. `
`Allow me to introduce myself again at that time. `
`...*cackle*cackle*cackle*." `
`The witch turned her back to her, laughing. `
`...Then, she began to head towards the mansion with an air of composure. `
`Maria energetically called out and watched her go, then began to dash towards the guesthouse, leaving Rosa behind. `
`...As though she wanted to inform the other cousins of her fortunate meeting with the witch as soon as she could. `
`At last, Rosa was left alone in the rose garden as the winds grew stronger, `
`...unable to do anything but pray that what had happened was just a daydream... `
`When the witch reached the entrance hall, ...Genji could be seen there. `
`Genji welcomed the 'guest' approaching from the entrance hall with a respectful bow... `
`"I have been waiting, `
`......Beatrice-sama." `
`"...It's been quite some time, Genji. `
`......Hmph. `
`You've gotten old." `
`"...No matter how old it becomes, furniture carries out its work like furniture until the end." `
`"...I remember how that man's wife used to be jealous of you. `
`...Is Kinzo doing well?" `
`"He is doing extremely well." `
`"...Hmph. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!" `
`The witch probably laughed because she knew Kinzo's own doctor had announced that Kinzo didn't have long to live. `
`...However, if anyone actually looked at Kinzo and noticed his vigor, which wasn't at all what you'd expect from someone nearing the end of his life, `
`they might easily call that 'doing extremely well'. `
`...Maybe that's what the witch was laughing at. `
`"Then let us go and greet him. `
`I look forward to hurling curses at each other after 30 years." `
`As the witch grinned, she started walking, leaving Genji behind. `
`...Her gait was like that of a family member who knew the inside of the mansion well. `
`Genji followed her in the manner of one who served her. `
`At that time, Kyrie came out of the parlor. `
`...She'd probably gone out to fix her makeup or something. `
`And when she saw Genji following a witch, she was surprised, although her expression did not change. `
`A guest for Kinzo had arrived, despite him being almost dead, on the day of the family conference when the fate of the inheritance was to be decided. `
`...And furthermore, this person was familiar enough with the Ushiromiya Family household that Genji was following behind her. `
`...Kyrie immediately realized that this person she had never met before was deeply important. `
`Kyrie and the witch's eyes met. `
`...Realizing that it would be rude to pretend not to notice, she greeted the witch. `
`"......It's a pleasure to meet you." `
`"You were Rudolf's second wife, yes?" `
`"Correct. `
`This is Kyrie-sama, Rudolf-sama's current wife." `
`From this exchange, Kyrie realized that this was a guest of fairly high rank, even amidst the Ushiromiya family. `
`......And, the fact that this was a guest on that level, `
`...coupled with her resemblance to the portrait in the entrance hall, ...made Kyrie's eyes instantly open wide... `
`"...Pleased to meet you. `
`I'm Kyrie. `
`I wonder if this is our first meeting. `
`If we have met before, I apologize for forgetting your name." `
`"...So, you intend to force me to state my name, even though you already have a vague idea of the answer?" `
`".................." `
`Kyrie thought she'd given a sociable and humble greeting. `
`Her expression grew slightly cloudy at that openly oppressive response. `
`...At any rate, this didn't seem to be a person she could grow to like. `
`...But if Kyrie's guesses were correct, ...this 'witch' probably held a vital key to what her own husband was most interested in, `
`something that couldn't help but influence tonight's family conference... `
`So without shooting back a retort, Kyrie silently watched her go up the stairs to the second floor, with Genji following behind. `
`So, when someone tapped her shoulder from behind, she was so surprised, she almost choked. `
`It was...Natsuhi... `
`"......Kyrie-san, `
`why are you standing still in a place like this? `
`Are you not feeling well...?" `
`"I-I'm sorry. `
`...I was just fascinated by the portrait of the witch for a bit." `
`"...Oh, you mean the Golden Witch, Beatrice. `
`The one whose gold was supposedly necessary for the revived Ushiromiya family we see today. `
`...Quite a fantastical story, just what one might expect from Father." `
`Natsuhi spoke in a perfectly ordinary way. `
`It was the sort of comment you'd expect from someone convinced that the thought of a witch existing was ridiculous, no more than another of Kinzo's ramblings. `
`...However, for some reason, that point of view didn't seem quite right to Kyrie now. `
`Just a moment ago, she herself had seen the Golden Witch come in from the entrance hall and climb up the stairs. `
`So, Natsuhi's words made it feel as though someone was trying to deny the existence of that person, `
`or else make it seem like she was never there to begin with... `
`"...I'm sorry. `
`Maybe I'm getting a bit of a headache. `
`...I think I'll rest for a little while." `
`"Oh, is that so...? `
`Then I have some good headache medicine. `
`I'll get it for you..." `
`The hallway in front of Kinzo's study was filled with the scent of sweet poison, peculiar to that green liquor... `
`Genji, who was completely used to it, did not grimace. `
`...And the Golden Witch didn't grimace either. `
`"...How long has he been in there since last he left?" `
`"I believe it has already been several years." `
`"......Is he that desperate to turn me into a bird in a cage? `
`...How pitiful. `
`......By now, you're the bird in a cage. `
`...You're the ghost of this study, are you not? `
`...How pitiful that he is unable to recognize even that." `
`"...Until he meets you again, he will probably continue his research, even after literally becoming a ghost." `
`"Is it love or madness or a delusion? `
`...And yet, perhaps even those can form magical power when strong enough. `
`...You sad magician." `
`The witch grasped the doorknob to the study. `
`...When she did, there was a sound like that of flesh burning and splitting open. `
`...It was the sound of the doorknob literally burning the witch's hand. `
`"...Beatrice-sama..." `
`"What is this? `
`......A ward against magic! `
`...Is that person unable to get by without relying on something like this...?" `
`"...I have heard that this door would cause you great pain, Beatrice-sama. `
`Shall I open it...?" `
`"No, ...it is fine. `
`If he wins, I will be a bird in a cage for all eternity. `
`...If he loses, only the life of a laughingstock will be left, the life of a pitiful magician who went mad with love and lost everything." `
`"...Already, Kinzo and even I are nothing more than pieces laid out on the game board. `
`...All that is left is for the roulette to decide who wins and who loses. `
`......Until the roulette shows its result, there is no need for me and Kinzo to meet again." `
`The witch looked at her hand, which was beginning to heal bit by bit, even though it had been horribly burned. `
`"...Or perhaps that is why he has this ward here in the first place. `
`......Hmph. `
`...Yes, perhaps even that is honorable in its own way. `
`...By now, everything sits on top of Kinzo's game board." `
`"I like it, Kinzo. `
`Allow me to enjoy my game with you. `
`...Allow me to enjoy the failure of the final gamble...of the old magician who fell in love with me and threw away his entire life...!!" `
