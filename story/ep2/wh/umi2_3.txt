`The biggest fall event for the Ushiromiya family was the family conference in October, `
`but to Jessica, there was another major event that came before that: the school cultural festival. `
`Jessica liked school. To her, it was a place where she could let out the stress she'd built up from the rigid lifestyle she was forced to lead at home. `
`For today's cultural festival, she'd formed a group with her friends... `
`and had announced that they'd perform some light music on a temporary stage. `
`She had prepared and practiced for this over and over until today, always anxiously awaiting this day's arrival, `
`......but there was one thing that worried her. `
`She looked at the clock. `
`...There was still a little time, ...but she felt uneasy. `
`Would that person really come? `
`After taking a single deep breath, her heart jumped when all her friends suddenly started speaking in shrill voices. `
`"No wa-y, Hina's boyfriend's so a-wesome!!" `
`"Isn't he?! `
`Isn't he?!" `
`"Rin's boyfriend looks re-ally smart! `
`Is it true that guy's a glasses beast?!" `
`"No way, no way, my husband'll be a pretty bo-y!" `
`"""*giggle*{p:0:♪} *giggle*{p:0:♪}""" `
`...It may not be like this for all girls, `
`...but at least at Jessica's school, the cultural festival was basically a boyfriend exhibition. `
`Jessica didn't have a boyfriend. `
`She had many friends of the opposite sex, but no special 'only one'. `
`...But Jessica was a little famous around the school, and everyone thought it'd be natural for her to have a fitting partner. `
`Furthermore, her pride had led her to pretend that this was true. `
`She'd somehow managed to keep them fooled until this year. `
`...But for various reasons, she hadn't been able to escape this year's cultural festival... `
`"Jessie-, `
`is your boyfriend he-re?" `
`"Wha?! `
`Ah, uh, no, looks like he's not here yet. `
`Maybe he's busy with work. `
`Ahahahahahahahahahaha..." `
`"So what kind of person is he, Jessie? `
`At least give us a hint. `
`What kind of relationship? `
`What kind of relationship?!" `
`"Awesome, so he's a working man?! `
`Will he come in a suit?! `
`Of course he'll be wearing glasses, right?! `
`Kyaa-!!" `
`"Heeeeeey, he actually doesn't exist, right? `
`If you come clean now, we'll let you join us! `
`Let's cry together through this year's cultural festivaaaal!" `
`"No no no, he exists he exists he exists, I told you, he really exists... `
`ahahahahahahahahahaha...!!" `
`Jessica's bitter smile was covered with cold sweat. `
`...It was starting to seem doubtful whether she really had deceived her sharp-witted friends... `
`"Okay. `
`Then, how about making a fake boyfriend and taking him with you?" `
`"A-A-A fake?! `
`Wh-Who...?! `
`I can't think of...anyone who'd do that!" `
`Shannon's ridiculous plan surprised Jessica into hysterics. `
`Even so, it was probably more realistic than the crazy methods running through her head about getting a boyfriend in the big rush before the cultural festival. `
`"For example, `
`...what about Kanon-kun?" `
`"K-K-Kanon-kuuuuuun?! `
`N-N-No way, no way!! `
`Anyway, I'm sure Kanon-kun has work on the day of the festival, `
`...and I don't wanna bother him..." `
`"Of course, I've already checked the schedule. `
`Kanon-kun has that day off." `
`"......Wh-Why are you always so clever when it comes to stuff like this...? `
`No, wait! `
`It'd be even worse if he's off... `
`I can't pull him away from a precious day off just for my own vanity!" `
`"If you don't pull Kanon-kun away, he'll always be shut away by himself, `
`so I think it'd be perfect if you could drag him out of his shell." `
`"Y‐y‐ `
`...You think so? `
`...No, `
`but... `
`I'd feel bad for him..." `
`"Then I guess you're out of options... `
`How about meekly confessing to everyone that you don't have a boyfriend?" `
`"...True, it may be terribly embarrassing, `
`but you'd only have to endure for the short and yet loooong time before graduation. `
`To a pair of lovers, there's no sweeter honey than the face of a single person with an inferiority complex{p:0:☆}" `
`"Sha‐Shannonnnn~!! `
`You aren't really worrying for my sake, are you? You're teasing me, riiiight?!!" `
`Jessica wrestled about with Shannon, her eyes teary. `
`But Shannon was unphased, laughing with her usual smile. `
`"Yes, `
`this is to get you back for making fun of me and George-sama all the time." `
`Listening to Shannon's comeback, the likes of which didn't happen even once a year, Jessica hugged her cushion and rolled around on her bed, pretending to faint in agony. `
`She couldn't stand Shannon's smile, which looked so triumphant, but right now, she was the only person Jessica could talk with. `
`She could choke her to death with her cushion later. `
`"Is it really so bad, Milady? `
`It's a cultural festival, but it's also a chance for you to have fun with Kanon-kun." `
`"No, that may be true, but... `
`no, no, no, no...!!" `
`Jessica buried her head in her favorite pillow to hide the fact that her face had grown bright red. `
`And she grumpily chewed the fingernail on her thumb. `
`...It really was a reaction to be appreciated. `
`Shannon and Jessica were of about the same age, of the same sex, and friends. `
`And they were both right in the middle of puberty. `
`They could never talk enough about love. `
`That's why they could talk freely about these topics to each other. `
`So, Jessica had heard a lot about how Shannon and George's love was progressing, `
`and Shannon had heard a lot about what type Jessica liked, what kind of man she might be interested in. `
`Judging by Jessica's reaction, it'd probably be rude for us to go into precisely what these things were... `
`However, this story won't get anywhere if we just have Jessica rolling around forever, so let's dive in. `
`Jessica had been thinking about Kanon ever since he'd shown up. `
`It was extremely rare for young men to visit Rokkenjima. `
`So maybe it was natural for Jessica, a girl in puberty, to develop an interest in Kanon. `
`But if anyone said that, it would destroy the romantic ideals of a maiden's pure heart and love at first sight. `
`Shannon had been with Kanon a long time at the orphanage, so she'd known him since before they started working. `
`So, Jessica had asked persistently about what his hobbies were, what his favorite food was, what type of girl he liked. `
`......Even to Shannon, it was clear that Jessica was infatuated with Kanon. `
`"Come on. `
`...Isn't this a good chance to take Kanon-kun on a date?" `
`"B-B-But but but, ...Kanon-kun might also have someone he likes, so... `
`wouldn't he take it badly if I made him go with me just to show off...?" `
`"People who aren't honest with themselves, like you, are... `
`...what was that word I learned from George-sama...? `
`That's right, I think it was "{c:86ef9c:tsundora}". `
`Apparently, they'll be all the rage in a decade or so." `
`"Wow, George nii-san sure is incredible, `
`managing to foresee future trends like that. `
`Awesome. `
`...No, wait! `
`Are you saying I'm living in the wrong decade?! `
`Waah, waah, waah, I give up!!" `
`...It took several days of wasted efforts, but in the end, Jessica agreed to the plan of having Kanon pretend to be her boyfriend... `
`"...Yes, Milady. `
`Did you call me?" `
`Jessica regretted calling out at such a bad time. `
`...Kanon always looked sullen, but he had some bad days and some better days. `
`...Unfortunately, this reaction was the former. `
`"N-N-No, umm, well, `
`......errr." `
`"..............." `
`All that confidence and effort she'd built up practicing in front of a mirror all night was wiped out in about five seconds... `
`Jessica turned bright red and hung her head. `
`When he saw that, Kanon sighed. `
`...Jessica thought that he was exasperated with her, and her face went pale. `
`"......I heard from Shannon. `
`This is about having me go with you to the school cultural festival, right, Milady?" `
`"Huh? `
`...Ah, aaaaaaahhh!! `
`Nice one, Shannon... `
`I mean...! `
`Y-Yeah, yeah. `
`Th-That's right, but, umm, err! `
`......D-D-Do you have any plans that day...?" `
`"...I was strictly ordered by Shannon to work specially for you on that day, Milady. `
`I have never been to high school, so I don't really understand, `
`but I hear it's a place where girls can be shamed if they don't have a boy with them. `
`...And I was given special orders to see to it that the daughter of the Ushiromiya family is in no way inferior to the common people." `
`"Waha... `
`wahahahahahahahahahaha, Shannon, I'll beat you to death lateeeeer!!!" `
`Jessica kept yelling with a strange voice and a broken smile, like a tea kettle filled with boiling water. `
`As Kanon watched this, he sighed again. `
`Kanon wasn't an idiot either. `
`He fully understood what Jessica intended by inviting him. `
`...But to be honest, playing along with Jessica's love game seemed like it'd be nothing more than an annoyance to him. `
`However, Shannon had asked him over and over. `
`He was deeply indebted to her, `
`so he couldn't refuse. `
`...And that brooch was in his pocket. `
`Could this strange turn of events have been brought about by the magic power residing in this brooch? `
`.........Ridiculous. `
`But he remembered what Shannon had said to him that day. `
`...What did Shannon {y:1:'see'}{n:1:'see'} that I cannot? `
`I don't understand Shannon's feelings. `
`We are furniture. `
`...As if we could...ever become anything more. `
`It was a truly odd exchange between Jessica, who was still rambling on in a strange voice, and Kanon, who sighed deeply... `
`"Jessie, someone's here!! `
`Didn't you hear?!" `
`"Huh, ah, ah, sorry!! `
`Wh-Who is it...?" `
`As my friends all gathered together, ...they were looking this way with hard-to-describe expressions, `
`whispering to each other in small voices that weren't small anymore. `
`My attempt to play dumb felt pretty transparent, even to me. `
`Did I really just say 'sorry, who is it'?! `
`Like I don't know who just showed up...! `
`Aaaaaaaaah, it's useless, it's useless, my mind's going blank... `
`"Omigod, that's Jessie's boyfriend?! `
`He's so cuuuuuuuuuuuuuute!!" `
`"Wait, he's real?! `
`No way, seriously?!" `
`"Jessica, you traitor!! `
`He's incredible!!" `
`"He's younger?! `
`I never heard he was younger!" `
`"Where where?! `
`Where, where, where's Jessie's boyfriend?!" `
`"She really is into little kids!!" `
`"H-H-H-H-Hey! `
`A-Aren't you late, wahahahahaha!" `
`"...I didn't know where the entrance was. `
`I must apologize for my tardiness." `
`"R-Right, umm, ...that outfit looks really good on you. `
`Wahahahahahahaha...!!" `
`"...Shannon...said normal clothes wouldn't do, ...so we went and bought this the other day. `
`...Does it look strange on me...?" `
`"W-Wahahahahahahahahahahahaha, that's not true! `
`Shannon, when I get back I'll promote you two leveeeeeeeels!!" `
`"......It feels like everyone here's a girl. It's uncomfortable." `
`"Y-Y-Yeah, isn't it?! `
`C-Come on, let's not hang around here, let's go to the stage, okay? `
`'Cause I'll be up pretty soon! `
`Come on come on come on!!" `
`Jessica seemed just as uncomfortable. `
`It looked like being bathed in everyone's interested gazes was hard on her. `
`...When he saw Jessica's appearance, Kanon thought he might have made things difficult for her by coming. `
`"...I get the feeling I'm getting in the way. `
`Am I being a burden?" `
`"I-I-I told you, no way!!" `
`"...Please tell me at any time if I start getting in the way..." `
`((Kyaa, no waaay, he calls himself 'boku'!!!!)) `
`"Ahiiiiiiiii, th-th-there's no way you'd get in the way, Kanon-kun!!" `
`(((Kyaaaaaa, she calls her boyfriend 'kun'!!!))) `
`"...What would you like me to do, Milady?" `
`(((Omigoood, she makes him call her Milady, like a butler, omg!!!))) `
`"Nooooooooo, you can't call me Milady todaaaaaaaaay!!" `
`".........I-Is that so? `
`As you wish, Jessica-sama." `
`(((((Kyaaaaa, she's trained him to call her 'sama'!!))))) `
`"S-S-S-Sorry, Kanon-kun, could you close your eyes for juuust three seconds...?" `
`((((((Hiiyaaaaaaa, a kiss, it's a kiss, she's gonna kiss him!!)))))) `
`"...A-As you wish." `
`BANG, `
`*thunk*! `
`*bam*bam*, `
`*slam*, `
`*crash*!! `
`...By the time Kanon opened his eyes, a horrible tragedy had occurred in the room. `
`Everyone had been driven into the walls, their arms and legs outstretched. `
`Jessica had slipped her brass knuckles back into her pocket before Kanon's eyes opened. `
`"A-Anyway, let's go over to the stage. `
`Our turn's coming up soon, so take a seat and wait for a bit. `
`'Cause we've gotta get ready! `
`Go straight to the end here and you'll see a temporary stage, you'll know where to go. Please wait there!" `
`She pushed Kanon's back, as he seemed to be having trouble moving himself, and chased him out. `
`Even though Kanon was confused by Jessica's attitude and her panicky state, which he'd never seen before, he followed her instructions and headed in the direction she had indicated. `
`After seeing him off with an awkward smile, Jessica slammed the door shut and yelled loudly. `
`"There you go, you saw, right? `
`You saw that, are you happy now?! `
`Wahahahahahahahaha, sucks for you!!!" `
`"...Ugugugugugugu, I lost the bet." `
`"I was sure Jessie didn't have a boyfriend." `
`"Are you sure that was her boyfriend? I'll bet she's just abusing one of her servants, right?" `
`"Waaaah, Jessie's boyfriend's incredibleeee...!" `
`"Sh-Sh-Shut up!! `
`Come on, let's get ready!!" `
`When Jessica took the brass knuckles out of her pocket again, everyone energetically returned to their tasks. `
`".........Haah." `
`Kanon went down the corridor Jessica had shown him...and ran into a temporary stage set up where the vending machines should have been. `
`It was probably being rented by the hour by some group or club. `
`The ones singing were student groups, but the crowd was still incredibly excited. `
`Disliking that clatter, he leaned against a wall in the darkness by himself. `
`...So this is what they call high school. `
`It sure is noisy. `
`...That's what Kanon thought. `
`Then he remembered Jessica just now, acting in a way that he'd never seen before. `
`...Honestly, she was in such high spirits that alcohol might have been involved. `
`To him, remaining composed and intellectual at all times was the highest virtue. `
`In that sense, it was very hard for Kanon to get used to the atmosphere of a school cultural festival. `
`...He had a responsibility to report everything he saw and heard to the Master. `
`...So he also had to report about how Jessica had acted without restraint earlier. `
`...At the very least, it was not fitting for the daughter of the Ushiromiya Head Family. `
`The Master, Krauss-sama, `
`...and especially Natsuhi-sama will probably be angry. `
`If I am to report it in a way that protects Milady, should I blame it on inappropriate school friends...? `
`"......What was all that? `
`...So stupid." `
`Kanon thought back on how Jessica had acted earlier and sighed again. `
`He could understand Natsuhi's headache a little now. `
`...Come to think of it, Natsuhi-sama, as the president of the PTA, was supposed to go to an informal gathering after attending the ceremony in the gymnasium. `
`She said she wouldn't be able to see Milady's performance, didn't she? `
`...That's probably for the best. `
`"......Crowds certainly are unpleasant. `
`...What in the world is going on?" `
`Several female students keep glancing at me. `
`It seems they're all whispering the same things Milady's school friends said, and it's truly unpleasant. `
`Come to think of it, didn't Shannon warn me? `
`...If you walk alone at something like a school festival, `
`you'd better watch out, because lots of strange people will come and talk to you. `
`"E-Excuse me, are you by yourself?" `
`Just as expected, a group of girls I'd never met started talking to me. `
`Their stares started to make my back tingle. `
`...Didn't she tell me some magic words that could chase them off in times like this? `
`...Ummm. `
`"...Sorry. `
`I'm with someone." `
`"Uh, oh, really...?! `
`I-I'm sorry!" `
`Ah, it worked. `
`Instant reaction... `
`Well, that got rid of them, but it hasn't really changed the number of people staring at me. `
`"No, it's that kid, Jessie's boyfriend!!" `
`"No way?! `
`It's that kid?!" `
`"I can't believe it, I was sure he was fake!" `
`"Isn't he cu-te? So he's younger?! `
`Lucky Jessie!!" `
`".........Haah." `
`...There's no way I'll ever come to a place like this again. `
`Kanon sighed for about the zillionth time that day. `
`When he did, the lighting changed, and the standing audience started cheering. `
`He looked around and realized that there was suddenly a large group of people there. `
`And unlike earlier, they were mostly guys. `
`With this huge crowd, he couldn't even see the stage. `
`Fortunately, there was a fallen beer case nearby, so he tried using that as a footstool. `
`When he did, he realized that there was now a new group on the stage. `
`Their leader is Milady. `
`She's changed into stage clothes, and she's even holding a guitar. `
`...I didn't know she could play. `
`Then again, maybe she can play. `
`I've seen her practicing air guitar before. `
`Natsuhi-sama wouldn't approve of any hobbies outside of study. `
`Maybe she was always practicing in secret. `
`...Come to think of it, she's been returning really late from school recently, hasn't she? `
`...Maybe she's been practicing at school, far away from Natsuhi-sama's prying eyes. `
`It really is for the best that Natsuhi-sama didn't come. `
`...If Milady were to get scolded by Natsuhi-sama after putting so many hours of practice in, she'd probably be dejected... `
`"""Jessie‐samaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!""" `
`"Everyone, thaaaaaaaaaanks for gathering here today!!" `
`I could hear Jessica-sama's forceful voice through the speakers. `
`...Jessie-sama? `
`Maybe that's her nickname at school. `
`The students in the audience kept calling out that name. `
`...I'm a little offended by that crude name. It's inappropriate for Milady. `
`Jessica-sama was in high spirits as they kept shouting 'Jessie-sama'. `
`...Everyone here was probably a fan. `
`Her mike performance picked up on that and electrified them even more. `
`...It was almost like a music program on TV. `
`.........At first, he'd thought this was all silly, but that feeling had changed into appreciation. It was incredible, in its own way. `
`Kanon never listened to music of his own free will, but he'd often heard the kind of music the Ushiromiya family liked. `
`...Since it was almost all classical, Kanon had naturally taken a liking to that kind of music. `
`...So to Kanon, the song Jessica sang was...how should you say it... `
`...Extremely colorful. `
`In any case, if Natsuhi-sama heard it, she'd probably faint. `
`But everyone looked like they were having a really good time. `
`Some die-hard fans, who had even brought pen-lights, `
`sang along and danced crazily with the same movements, almost as though it had been planned ahead. `
`On the stage, Jessica-sama also sang enthusiastically, dripping with sweat. `
`......He couldn't find a single element that was appropriate for a daughter of the Ushiromiya family, `
`...but it looked like so much fun. `
`"""Jessie‐samaaaaaaaa!! `
`Jessiiiiie, Jessiiiiiiiiiiie!!!""" `
`"Again, today, behind me, the sound of footsteps! Oyashiro-sama is stalking me! Curses, disappearances, sacrifices, torture, Onikakushi, does that make a good snack?! Don't say Marisaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!" `
`...I must not go along with it, but... `
`...At any rate, Milady is full of life and looks like she's having a great time. `
`As I watched Milady enjoying herself, I thought. `
`Could this be Ushiromiya Jessica's true nature? `
`...Don't I know better than anyone...that during her life on Rokkenjima, she's had no choice but to kill her sense of self? `
`So the time she spends...not as Milady, successor to the Ushiromiya family, `
`but as a single girl called Jessica, living life to the fullest, must be very important to her. `
`...I've worked close to Milady, seeing her in all seasons, and thought I knew everything about her. `
`...But that was all limited to one side of her, the Milady of Rokkenjima. `
`...We are furniture. `
`We serve on Rokkenjima and end our lives on Rokkenjima. `
`...So I've come to think of Rokkenjima itself as our whole world. As though, like in Ptolemaic theory, `
`the ocean spilled off the end of the world into an abyss. `
`But when I look at Milady like this, I can see how horribly narrow that outlook is. `
`...I still can't go along with the excitement of the crowd. `
`...But I feel like I can see something that 'cannot be seen' on Rokkenjima. `
`......I'm not sure if this is the unseeable thing Shannon was talking about... `
`...But the ocean still doesn't look blue to me... `
`"Wasn't the cultural festival at Jessica's school today? `
`...How is the principal doing?" `
`"...He seemed to be in good health. `
`That's right, Diet Member Takamiya was also there. `
`He said to give you his regards." `
`"Hmm, busy as usual?" `
`"It appeared so. `
`That person is also very energetic. `
`Oh, and I believe President Emoto also made an appearance." `
`Naturally, the topic of Jessica's cultural festival came up at dinner. `
`School events often became social gatherings for local volunteers. `
`It was the same for the Ushiromiya family, who were celebrities around here. `
`Natsuhi remembered the name of one VIP after another at that social gathering, telling Krauss the news about them. `
`...Jessica didn't really have any interest in that discussion and rudely slurped her pumpkin soup. `
`"...Milady, `
`perhaps you ought to take more care with your manners." `
`".........Yeah, yeah, sorry 'bout that." `
`"Jessica, `
`how many times must I tell you to watch your language?" `
`"...Yes Ma'am." `
`Jessica answered, discouraged. `
`When he saw that, Krauss smiled a little and paused his conversation with Natsuhi. `
`"How was the festival for you, Jessica?" `
`"Huh? `
`Ah, `
`...well, it was okay!" `
`"I was watching. `
`You did an excellent job." `
`"Huh, ...huh?! `
`...A-Ahahahaha, w-well!" `
`Jessica's face turned bright red. `
`...She probably hadn't imagined that Natsuhi would actually come to see her on stage. `
`She felt a mix of happiness and embarrassment. `
`Actually, she hadn't really wanted her mother to watch, since she didn't want to be told that her music was inappropriate for the Ushiromiya family. `
`...But it certainly didn't make her unhappy to hear a parent say she'd done a good job, after watching her try her best... `
`"Jessica acted with both composure and dignity. `
`Fitting behavior for the students' representative." `
`"...ah, `
`......oh, `
`...yeah." `
`The smile that had been there until a second ago crumbled like sand. `
`...Jessica immediately realized that her mom was talking about something different. `
`Jessica was also the school's student president. `
`...She had no interest in doing something so annoying, but her parents had been pushy, so she'd grudgingly accepted. `
`Unfortunately, she was popular at school, so she won the election easily. `
`So, Natsuhi was praising her for the student council sponsorship ceremony at the beginning of the cultural festival. `
`Actually, she had just carried that out halfheartedly. `
`After that, she immediately met up with her friends and held a stage rehearsal for the rest of the time... `
`"That experience of standing above people and bearing responsibility will surely prove useful in the future. `
`I'm sure it will help Jessica mature as a member of the Ushiromiya family." `
`"But you rushed a little while giving the greeting. `
`You get a pass on content, but the fast pace of your speech lessened the impact. `
`It might help if you developed a habit of pausing every once in a while." `
`"............Yeah." `
`After she finished eating, Jessica didn't feel like going straight to her room. `
`Her room was basically the place her parents had ordered her to be. `
`So perhaps for Jessica, instead of returning to her own room, `
`being in an unknown location in this large mansion was a meager form of resistance... `
`Jessica felt that even being in the mansion made it hard to breathe, so she went outside to the rose garden. `
`"......... `
`...Well, even if she did show up, I'm sure she would've said something about how it wasn't appropriate for a successor of the Ushiromiya Family. `
`...So isn't it better this way? `
`Ahahahahahaha." `
`Jessica laughed at what she was sulking over. `
`...She laughed at what kind of words she could possibly have been expecting. `
`...That was dumb of me. `
`In the end, I was just acting like an entitled brat. `
`I'm a little exasperated with myself, and it makes me want to laugh. `
`"...Milady." `
`"Wah, ...Kanon-kun. `
`D-Don't scare me like that, hahaha...! `
`*cough*cough*!" `
`Just as she was about to force a laugh, Kanon suddenly started talking to her, and she choked. `
`"What's up? `
`Got something to say...?" `
`"..................... `
`Umm." `
`"...Yes?" `
`Jessica's expression became the one she always wore when looking at Kanon. `
`The listless Jessica from a second ago was gone. `
`If he had still only known Jessica as the eventual successor to the Ushiromiya family, as he had until yesterday, `
`...he might have mistakenly thought that Jessica's mood had sprung back to normal. `
`...But that wasn't right. `
`He now knew a part of her that he couldn't have {y:1:'seen'}{n:1:'seen'} until yesterday, so he understood that there was no way Jessica actually felt the way she appeared. `
`"Oh, ...about today's cultural festival... `
`...Well, thanks for coming with me so I could show off. `
`You saved my butt out there." `
`"...That song. `
`...You were really good." `
`"Wha?! `
`......Ah, `
`......ahahahahahaha?! `
`Re‐really? I'm embarrassed..." `
`Even though she had heard the words she most wanted to hear, `
`Jessica acted shyly and couldn't accept them openly. `
`"...I cannot sing. `
`And I don't know how to play any instruments other than the harmonica and the recorder, which I learned in elementary school. `
`...So I simply assumed you were the same, Milady." `
`...At the time, Kanon had never felt as though he'd been looking down on Jessica in this way. `
`But all the people he'd seen playing special instruments were on the other side of the Braun tubes in the TV. `
`...At the very least, he'd been under the impression that it'd be impossible for Jessica. `
`"...I am furniture. `
`...So I didn't believe there was any need to sing or play instruments." `
`But... `
`I'm not sure anymore. `
`"...Seriously, Kanon-kun, `
`enough with that 'I am furniture' business... `
`That's like a proper attitude you servants are supposed to have, right...? `
`Servants are supposed to be like living furniture. `
`...Genji-san says it a lot." `
`"It isn't just a proper attitude... `
`...Because we really are...furniture." `
`"I know the kids from the Fukuin House...receive assistance from Grandfather in various ways, `
`and I realize how grateful you are for that. `
`...But it's a bit cruel for you to have to call yourself furniture just because of that. `
`We're all human, aren't we?" `
`"............" `
`"Kanon-kun, when you saw me singing, ...what did you think?" `
`"...It looked like you were having a lot of fun." `
`"I don't think that's true." `
`"...Huh?" `
`"You didn't just think it looked fun. `
`...You were envious, weren't you?" `
`"......... `
`That's not..." `
`Kanon probably hadn't noticed that emotion himself. `
`...Most likely, Kanon saw something he'd never seen before, learned about it for the first time, ...and felt envious. `
`And to trick himself out of that emotion, he'd called himself furniture over and over... `
`"I know I'm a successor to the Ushiromiya family or whatever, `
`...and, well, I'm sure there'll be a lot of annoying stuff to do from now on. `
`As far as that goes, I can't do anything but give up, since I was born under an unlucky star." `
`"...Probably, just like you had to live at the Fukuin House, I don't have a choice either. `
`I couldn't choose the stars under which I was born." `
`"......That may be true." `
`"But there's one place where you and I are completely different. `
`...Know what that is?" `
`I am furniture, and Milady is not. `
`...He was about to say that, but stopped. `
`"...I do not know." `
`"Kanon-kun, you decided that your fate determines everything about you, and you gave up. `
`But I can't accept this kind of fate, so I do the best I can. `
`...So, while there's still the rigid and cornered 'me' that's gotta stay as the daughter of the Ushiromiya family, `
`I've created another 'me' that can do what I like to the fullest." `
`"......Another...you." `
`"Yeah. `
`...Kanon-kun, you've been instructed to say 'because I am furniture'. `
`...I'm sure you've gone through a lot of tough times just because of that. `
`...I think that's... `
`...really unfortunate. `
`......But the idea that your entire life'll be decided by that alone...just seems sad to me." `
`".................." `
`"You know, it's always possible for people to create another 'self' inside them, a self that they can truly grow to like. `
`I'm not talking about escaping from reality, okay? `
`...When I'm that other self, I can really feel like I'm living a great life. `
`So no matter how constrained and boring everyday life gets to be, I can always live on without suffocating." `
`"......To make... `
`another self inside yourself... `
`that you can truly grow to like..." `
`To make another me, one that isn't furniture... `
`Through her relationship with George-sama, has Shannon given birth to another self that isn't furniture? `
`...And did this other Shannon...see something that cannot be 'seen' by furniture? `
`"That's right. `
`......Well, I don't know anything about your private life, Kanon-kun. `
`But...I can sorta guess. `
`Your private life...probably doesn't exist at all. `
`Am I right...?" `
`Kanon couldn't reply, but that was answer enough. `
`He had no concept of a private life. `
`So, Kanon would always be Kanon. `
`So, furniture would always be furniture. `
`"...Kanon-kun, Kanon isn't your real name, right?" `
`In the Fukuin House, new graduates would be given new families and a new life, so they were also given a new name. `
`...In his case, that was 'Kanon'. `
`"......Certainly, ...this name of mine may be a temporary thing." `
`Before, he had thought of himself as Kanon, and no one else. `
`...But he remembered. `
`...There definitely had been another self that wasn't Kanon. `
`But that was far, far away, beyond the distant fog of oblivion... `
`"So even for you, it should be okay to have times when you're Kanon-kun, and times when you aren't. `
`...Maybe when you act as a servant, that Kanon-kun calls himself furniture and strictly limits his own will." `
`"...But when you aren't Kanon-kun, I think it's okay to live much, much more freely." `
`Those words definitely weren't just lip-service. `
`Jessica had also been like this in the past. `
`She had cursed her own birth into an environment different from all of her friends at school. `
`Only she had been in a heavily constricted environment, forced to learn all sorts of things, `
`and she had even been told whom she was and wasn't allowed to play with. `
`...It may have been sad, but she'd given up, resigning herself to the fact that she'd been born under that kind of star. `
`But one day, Jessica stopped giving up and surrendering. `
`Stuff like Ushiromiya family customs and pressure didn't matter. `
`She created a real 'Jessica' inside herself, one who could do what she really wanted to do. `
`"You know, I go by the nickname Jessie at school. `
`When I'm Jessie, I live life honestly and to the fullest. `
`And because of that, I can do my best when I'm Jessica too." `
`"...Would it really be so bad... `
`if you could also have times when you're Kanon, and times when you're...umm, `
`...your real name? `
`...When you aren't Kanon, ...can't you try becoming another self that you can like?" `
`"............A time when...I am not Kanon." `
`He'd once thought of his real name as being completely meaningless. `
`Because of that, he'd thought that 'Kanon' summed up everything about him. `
`And now, Jessica was telling him to create something new, another self that wasn't Kanon. `
`"...Kanon-kun, `
`if you don't mind, tell me. `
`...What's...your real name?" `
`"..............." `
`He was silent for quite some time. `
`Maybe Kanon's real name had risen to the tip of his tongue. `
`...After hesitating for a long time over whether he should say it, `
`...in the end, `
`...he swallowed it back down. `
`"...I forgot. `
`...My name doesn't matter anymore." `
`Those words contained a faint rejection. `
`"No matter what kind of real name I had, `
`...the only truth now is that here, I am Kanon. `
`The past has nothing to do with anything. `
`...The materials with which furniture is made, be it a trunk of a tree or otherwise, are meaningless in the end." `
`"...I told you to stop that! `
`You aren't furniture, you're human, right?!" `
`"I am not human!" `
`Kanon clearly voiced his refusal. `
`...It was with a rage that he normally didn't show. `
`Jessica couldn't say anything back and was struck silent... `
`"...You are human, Milady. `
`So you are free to live any way you please, `
`and any kind of future is possible for you. `
`It's almost like you have wings and can dance through the sky like a bird. `
`But I am not like that. `
`Even if I looked like a bird, I'd be nothing more than a domestic duck. `
`...Even though they have wings, they cannot fly." `
`"To speak of that dream of flight despite that, `
`...It's just... `
`too cruel...!" `
`"...Furniture and ducks!! `
`What the hell is all this?!! `
`......No. ......" `
`Jessica had unconsciously gone along with Kanon's forceful manner of speaking, but she realized that she shouldn't fire back and swallowed her words. `
`"......I don't know anything about you. `
`I don't even know your upbringing, and I don't know the hardships you've been through. `
`...So I can't even imagine why you started calling yourself furniture." `
`"...But know this. `
`You aren't furniture or a duck. `
`You're a real human." `
`"..............." `
`"If you want to say Kanon-kun's furniture when he's working as a servant, that's fine. `
`...But...in that case, `
`...don't you think you can create a self for when you aren't furniture, for when you're human?" `
`"...Only a human like Milady can embrace that possibility. `
`...I am not like that. `
`I have no future, no possibilities, ...no dream that I am allowed to see. `
`......So, Milady, `
`Please don't... `
`say any more... `
`...cruel things..." `
`"Why... `
`Why...do you say stuff like that...?" `
`"Because it seems you mistakenly think I'm a human, the same as you, Milady. `
`We are different sorts of beings. `
`I just wanted to make that clear." `
`"...I heard from Shannon. `
`Something about Milady liking me." `
`"Huh, ...wha?! `
`Ah, ......no, wahaha..." `
`"...I look almost identical to a human. `
`So, ......like Shannon, I could probably delude myself into thinking I'm human...and pretend to love, for a time." `
`"...But then, I would surely be fooling myself. `
`No, I would be fooling you too, Milady. `
`Shannon and George-sama will definitely fall apart. `
`...Even though Shannon herself probably realizes that day will come, ...she's taking part in such a stupid..." `
`"...Th-There's nothing stupid about it!! `
`Sure, George nii-san's a wonderful person, and he's gotta match up to his parents' expectations. `
`...I'm sure when it comes to marriage, Aunt Eva'll interfere in various ways, and, umm, I think their future prospects look like they'll be full of trouble, okay?! `
`...But you know what? George nii-san isn't the kind of guy who'll surrender to that shit! `
`Shannon's no Juliet, and he'll definitely bring her happiness!!" `
`"People cannot engage in romance with furniture. `
`...What I'm trying to say...is that even if you can love furniture, I cannot love you, Milady." `
`"............Nn-" `
`Those words of Kanon's...crushed all of Jessica's bittersweet feelings from that day. `
`There was no way her emotions could've predicted that she'd be refused so bluntly... `
`In an instant, she lost the willpower that had led her to try and unravel something stubborn in Kanon's heart, `
`...and before she knew it, she was just standing there in shock... `
`"...Milady, if your feelings for me were due to my conceit, then I must ask that you forgive me." `
`"...N-No. `
`Well, ...I won't deny that." `
`"...Thank you very much." `
`"Huh...?" `
`"Thank you very much... `
`for thinking of me as a human. `
`Those feelings alone really do make me happy. `
`...Anything more would be too cruel for me, so..." `
`"No, I-I've said enough. `
`...Umm, `
`......sorry about that." `
`Jessica recklessly scratched at her head and spoke, trying to force her voice to sound bright. `
`"......I just kinda... `
`...ran on ahead by myself... `
`and was a burden on you. `
`...I'm honestly sorry. `
`I'm really sorry...for using up your whole day off." `
`"No. `
`...I was also...happy that I could see you having fun." `
`"Then...let's call it a night. `
`...If I don't go back to my room and turn off the lights, Mom'll get mad at me again. `
`...Hahaha." `
`"That's probably for the best. `
`...I wish you a good night, Milady." `
`"...Yeah. `
`......Good night......" `
`Kanon saw Jessica trod away with her back to him, looking disheartened. `
`But then, she suddenly broke into a reckless dash and disappeared in the direction of the mansion... `
`As he watched her back, ...for just an instant, `
`Kanon was tormented by the feeling that he'd just made a huge mistake. `
`...But he hadn't made a mistake at all. `
`...He'd been forced to refuse her now for her sake, while the pain was still at its smallest. `
`"......Nice going, making a woman cry like that. `
`*cackle*cackle* `
`I didn't expect you to refuse her that strongly. `
`...If you'd given a normal answer, another pair of lovers would've been born thanks to my magic." `
`"How long have you been there...? `
`......What a horrible person." `
`When he turned around, the witch was suddenly there. `
`...It looked like she'd been there the whole time, watching the two of them as though enjoying a play. `
`"I shall forgive you for your insults just this once, in deference to that amusing little show. `
`...Even after a thousand years, no more interesting show exists than complications between boys and girls. `
`To me, it's a pleasure that's better and more addictive than opium. `
`...Hmm?" `
`Kanon pulled the butterfly brooch out of his pocket. `
`It was the manifestation of the great magic the witch had bestowed. `
`Without hesitation, Kanon slammed it against the ground and stomped on it. `
`"...Hoh? `
`What is the meaning of this? You know that was given by me." `
`"Just now, I figured it out. `
`...What you're doing isn't as tasteful as being a cupid of love. `
`You're just a demon who enjoys showing love to those who can never be together, deceiving them." `
`"......Hmph. `
`...You are free to think that. `
`Most humans I lend my power to say the same thing." `
`"Don't play dumb!! `
`You didn't lend Shannon your power because you felt sorry for her. `
`...You found a weak point in Shannon's heart as her chest burned with love, and you made her break the mirror that sealed you. `
`What's more, `
`...you guessed how this would all end, and now you're toying with her! `
`Am I wrong?!" `
`"Hehheheheheh, *cackle*! `
`Furniture has a thoroughly pitiful existence. `
`So, you have no dreams, no future, and even no love? `
`Good, good, there is nothing better than knowing your place. `
`*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"......Nngg..." `
`"As you noticed, there was a faint love residing in Jessica's heart. `
`You seem to think you've snipped it in the bud." `
`"...But did you know? `
`Trees grow thicker branches if you thin out and prune them. ...A girl who loves furniture, is it? Amusing, how truly amusing! `
`Shannon and George will also eventually reach a stalemate with their unfulfillable love, ripening into the sort of large fruit I love." `
`"However, regretfully, it seems to be going so smoothly for those two that it's hardly entertaining anymore. `
`But on the plus side, it seems the two of you will amuse me to no end, *cackle*cackle*!" `
`The witch laughed. `
`Even though she had known the two could never be together, she had lent magic to bring them together. `
`However, they couldn't escape the fate that prevented them from ever being truly joined. `
`...The witch knew that. `
`Even if they were joined, Shannon and George, Kanon and Jessica would eventually break up. `
`They would wander through an endless desert in this hell of love, tormented by an eternal thirst...! `
`"What, did you think I'd lend you my power and ask for nothing in exchange? `
`I'll gladly assist a pair in love. `
`And in exchange, I'll enjoy watching the cruel fate they'll eventually meet. `
`I have never come across a better show, not over the course of a thousand years...!" `
`"Just look at Kinzo. `
`See how he ended up: an old, pitiful man who learned the taste of love before being thrown out of paradise! `
`Look at how he lives, like a dead man that cannot fully die. `
`*cackle*cackle*!!" `
`"You truly are a witch. `
`Disappear! Get out of my sight, demon...!!" `
`"...Oh, I would disappear even without your prompting. `
`My power still hasn't returned. `
`It is still tiring to continue showing myself. `
`...I overdid it when I gave you lovers my power. `
`...As I am now, it will not be easy to maintain that power without that brooch as a catalyst." `
`Kanon ground his foot even more into the stomped brooch. `
`He felt it break under his foot. `
`Then, it evaporated like water... `
`and changed into butterflies that sparkled gold, fluttering out from beneath Kanon's foot... `
`"Maintaining this form is quite painful for me as well. `
`I will hide myself for a time, just as you desire. `
`My magical power will rise as surely as the moon and the tides. `
`...And eventually, a fitting time will come for my revival." `
`"...I know not in the slightest whether that will be tomorrow, next year, or even a hundred or a thousand years in the future. `
`But as long as there are those who entertain me, I will surely gain power and revive. `
`...I will disappear for a short while, ...until that time comes." `
`"The bruise on the palm of your hand is already gone, `
`so if you wish, tomorrow morning, you can let my existence vanish like an illusion or a dream. `
`...After all, nothing saddens me more than being forgotten." `
`"However, I will surely be revived. `
`Be on your guard, so that you will not regret that day's coming when it arrives. `
`I will surely have my second coming and rule over everything as this island's true master. `
`...That is the time when the door to the Golden Land will be opened again. `
`...The greedy dead will surely wake me...!" `
`"...You talk too much!! `
`Disappear, now, Golden Witch...!!" `
`The witch became a cloud of gold butterflies and scattered away, leaving behind a scornful laugh. `
`...The whole area sparkled like a gold blizzard in a snow globe. `
`It was a fleeting fantastical scene that disappeared in a heartbeat... `
`The witch could no longer be seen. `
`...However, Kanon felt like he could still hear that shrill, unpleasant laugh... `
`...Aah, how amusing, how truly amusing. `
`Why is the human world still so amusing after all the years I've been away?! `
`Go mad with love. Go mad with gold. `
`Those who don't go mad from one of the two are not human! `
`I see, so that's why the word 'furniture' is so fitting, *cackle*cackle*! `
`Furniture is created to serve humans. `
`And I cruelly treat humans as playthings to sate my thousand years of boredom. `
`What a truly amusing three-way deadlock, that I cannot control furniture! `
`Kinzo, you fool, what a truly entertaining scheme you've worked out! `
`Furniture, you fools, just you try and see if you can fell me...! `
`Tonight, two seeds of love have been sown. `
`...Including the one already sown, that makes three! `
`"Beatrice... `
`Why...did you leave me alone in this painful world...? `
`...I hate you. `
`I will hate you for all eternity for not even trying to answer, despite being yearned for so...!" `
`"Master, drinking any more will be damaging to your health. `
`...Doctor Nanjo warned you as well, did he not?" `
`"Be silent, Genji!! `
`You do not understand, you do not understand my grief and sadness! `
`And I believed at least you, my oldest friend, would understand my pain!! `
`Why can you not understand?! `
`Oooooohhh, Beatriiiiiice, `
`why did you leave me all alooooone...?!!" `
`".................." `
`"Aaaaaaaagggghhh! `
`Hic, hic...! `
`What the hell do you mean, furniture?! `
`I don't get it...! `
`Aaaaahhhh!!" `
`"...Oooh, poor Jessica-sama. `
`...Even though the cries I hear coming from your room tell me of the situation, there is nothing I can do. `
`...This is all a tragedy due to a pair who are too young getting too close, when the positions of their birth are too distant. `
`...I can do nothing but understand Milady's feelings, hide my footsteps, and quietly walk away..." `
`"...Umm, `
`...wh- `
`what... `
`do you mean by that, `
`George-san...?" `
`"I mean what I said. `
`...I still haven't built up my castle. `
`Once I manage to do that, I'll finally be able to think of myself as an adult. `
`...When that happens, I want to marry you." `
`"...Th- `
`That's, umm, `
`...err..." `
`"But... `
`my heart won't let me do that anymore. `
`...So I want to give you an engagement ring." `
`"En‐...engagement... `
`...you say... `
`But, umm, `
`......I... `
`...am......... `
`...furniture......" `
`"Oh, right, that. `
`Well then, furniture has to listen to what people say, right? `
`...Right now, I'm having a ring made that'll be fitting for you. `
`I think it'll be ready in time for me to bring it to the upcoming family conference. `
`I'll give it to you then, so please, I want you to let me hear your answer." `
`"...If you accept, `
`then I'll proclaim our engagement right there, in front of all the relatives including Grandfather." `
`"...G-George-san......" `
`"I'm sure some people won't approve of our relationship. `
`...But there's no need to look at their faces. `
`...Because you only have to fill your eyes with me." `
`"I will definitely bring you happiness. `
`That's the one thing I can promise you with certainty." `
`I just can't wait to see how it will ripen! `
`The gold butterflies do not swoop upon the juice of overripe and rotting fruit. `
`I cannot wait for the day of harvest to come! Is the time of the banquet here yet?! *cackle*cackle*hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!! `
