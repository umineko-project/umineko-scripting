`...What is that sound that always fills my ears? `
`Is it the sound of the rain, the sound of a waterfall, or could it be radio static? `
`If not, I want it to be the sound of blood flowing through my body. `
`...I want it to be the sound of the blood circulating throughout me, telling me that I am still alive... `
`".........Nnn... `
`...Is it...morning...?" `
`The light entering through a crack in the curtain was faint, but it at least told him that dawn had broken. `
`Kinzo, still in the position he'd been when he woke up, ...still sitting in a chair and looking up at the ceiling, ...felt the blood slowly travel throughout his body... `
`...Judging by the clock, it was early morning, 6:00 on the dot. `
`...No matter how tired he was, no matter how deeply he slept, he always woke up at exactly this time, as though he had measured it with an hourglass. `
`He didn't think of this as something to boast about, but he told himself that, as long as he could still manage this, his health couldn't be that bad. `
`"......Morning has come, which means... `
`......hmmm. `
`...It would appear I've avoided becoming one of the first sacrifices. `
`...Was I merely lucky when the roulette was spun, ...or is this the fruit of my efforts? `
`How irritating that I cannot tell the difference, but I mustn't be bothered by such trivialities." `
`Kinzo was struck by a faint desire to see beyond the study door. `
`After all, he might find the traces of someone's vain struggle to break through the door, `
`a sign that someone had tried to select him as one of the first six sacrifices. `
`"...Hmph. `
`......Humans are cheap creatures. `
`...Even though everything is ultimately decided by God, when humans are given good fortune, they arrogantly feel it was due to their own ability." `
`That was why he wanted to check whether there was a wretched mark on the door. `
`...The very desire was human. `
`And that was why Kinzo did not check. `
`He often rejected desires that came to him because he was human. `
`By doing that, he could be immersed in a feeling of sufficiency, as though he himself had become a being that surpassed humans... `
`He recognized human desires for what they were...and guarded against them. `
`Things that a human would want to do, he resisted. `
`...This eccentricity and rebellious nature had surely given him a rare genius, `
`making it possible for him to succeed in his exploits as he revived the Ushiromiya family in a single generation... `
`"Well then, {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`What were the six pieces you took? `
`...And, what will your next move be? `
`...Entertain me. `
`......My defense is perfect. `
`I will not shame myself like last time. `
`...Heh, ...heheheh." `
`The servants woke early. `
`They had to open the curtains, prepare breakfast, and complete various other tasks to welcome the guests to a new day. `
`Gohda was the most enthusiastic. `
`During the family conference, he had been told to concentrate his efforts especially on cooking, `
`and he'd been specially exempted from several tasks that servants normally must do. `
`...Gohda, who was a show off, seemed to be feeling particularly superior because of that. `
`He let Genji and the rest prepare the rest of the mansion...and worked on making breakfast in the kitchen. `
`Genji split the work with Shannon and Kanon, and they carried out various tasks. `
`Shannon headed to the dining hall and knocked. `
`...Last year, the family conference had continued into the early hours of the morning. `
`It wouldn't have been odd if this year's conference had done the same. `
`Considering the possibility that they were still having a discussion inside, she knocked. `
`But there was no response, so she opened the door and said good morning. `
`"...Good morning. `
`......Is anyone there?" `
`The room was cold, and the conference seemed to have ended a long time before. `
`There was a tea set on the table from which they'd probably been drinking, arranged in a way that would make it easy to clean up. `
`Cleaning up the tea was a servant's job. `
`If the family members were extra generous and cleaned it up themselves, the servants would lose face. `
`So, it was a truly pleasant act of kindness for the family to do only this much. `
`As she approached the table to clean it, she noticed something like a memo that had been left near the utensils and cups. `
`Since it was right next to the tea set, Shannon picked it up, naturally thinking it was a memo for the servant doing the cleaning. `
`Written there was not a request, nor was it thanks for preparing the tea. There was just a single word. `
`Shannon looked at it blankly and read it out loud... `
`"......Chapel. `
`......?" `
`A small sound kept repeating over and over. `
`Normally, that sound would've been too trivial to be worth caring about. `
`If only I could stop hearing it soon, I could go back to sleep right away, ...she thought vaguely. `
`...But no matter how much time passed, the sound did not end. `
`It repeated over and over. `
`Aaah, shut up. `
`Who is it? `
`Banging on the door this whole time... `
`As soon as she realized that, she woke up. `
`...Someone was knocking. `
`Then, she noticed that it wasn't just a knock, but a voice as well. `
`"......Rosa-sama, ...Rosa-sama. `
`...Good morning." `
`"...W-Wait. `
`I'm coming now." `
`It had been Genji's voice. `
`Looking at the clock, it wasn't even 7:00 yet. `
`...It was clearly too early to wake the guests. `
`...Did something happen that was bad enough to cause this? `
`She felt her sleepiness increasingly fade thanks to this premonition of misfortune. `
`Though Genji was a servant, Rosa had known him since her childhood days, so even though she was slightly defenseless in her pajamas, she opened the door a crack and answered. `
`"Good morning. `
`I apologize for waking you this early." `
`"...Did something happen?" `
`"Yes... `
`......Actually, at the chapel...... `
`Genji...whispered something into Rosa's ear. `
`For a second, it seemed Rosa couldn't understand what she'd been told. `
`After having it repeated several times, she realized that apparently, something strange had happened. `
`Rosa closed her door for a second, changed her clothes quickly, and followed Genji towards the mansion... `
`The chapel requires some explanation. `
`It wasn't in the mansion, but in a grove behind it, a short walk's distance away. `
`It had been built at the same time as the mansion, `
`so though its walls had been repaired many times, making it look new from the outside, it was a very old building. `
`Rosa dashed through the rain along with Genji. `
`Just like the previous night, the rain was falling in earnest. `
`Eventually, the chapel came into sight from beyond a thin grove... `
`Just looking at it from the outside, it seemed a place of dazzling beauty, where a pair of young lovers might want to get married. `
`However, Kinzo apparently viewed it as a very sacred place, `
`so Rosa and her siblings had been given strict instructions not to approach it unnecessarily. `
`Even though they were all grown up now, approaching the chapel for any reason would still make them feel guilty... `
`and also afraid, as if their Father might get angry and hit them in the face... `
`The servants' silhouettes could be seen in front of the chapel's entrance. `
`Gohda, Shannon and Kanon. `
`...Which meant that all of the servants on the morning shift had gathered. `
`A short while ago, Genji had spoken to Rosa, telling her what the situation was. `
`However, ...without laying eyes on it directly, she definitely hadn't been able to understand... `
`It was probably the same for all the servants gathered here as well. `
`...{i:Without seeing it with their own eyes}, they wouldn't have been able to understand what was going on. `
`On the door at the entrance to the chapel... `
`was something very large, ...drawn with a creepy, stringy paint that made one think of blood... ...Something like a creepy magic circle. `
`"Wh‐ `
`What is... `
`...this...? `
`When was it drawn here?!" `
`The servants looked at each other. `
`Gohda was the first to open his mouth. `
`"...M-My apologies. `
`We don't usually enter this building, so we don't know when it was made." `
`"Then who was the first person to find it?!" `
`"I-It was me. `
`...When I went to the dining hall to clean up the tea set, ...I found a memo with "chapel" written on it..." `
`Shannon held out the memo with a shaking hand. `
`"...Whose handwriting is it? `
`It isn't Nii-san's or Nee-san's. `
`...So, after that, you came here and found this, right?" `
`"Yes..." `
`"...Rosa-sama, ......look at this." `
`"What? `
`<......Happy Halloween...for...> `
`...What?!" `
`Kanon pointed at a single line of English written below the creepy magic circle. `
`Until it had been pointed out to her, she'd thought it was just another part of the magic circle. `
`There, the following words were written in English: `
`<Happy HALLOWEEN for MARIA.> `
`Happy Halloween... `
`For Maria... `
`This creepy magic circle... `
`was for Maria. `
`<Happy Halloween.> `
`Yesterday, only one person had said <Happy Halloween> to Maria... `
`The key phrase matched. `
`...It was the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}...! `
`"Wh-What about Maria?! `
`She should be sleeping with her cousins, right? `
`Did you check?!" `
`"...My apologies. `
`We just now realized that Maria-sama's name was written here. `
`...We still have not checked. `
`Quickly-" `
`"What are you doing?!! `
`I'll go check on Maria and come back! `
`Tell Krauss nii-san and the rest too. `
`After that, follow their instructions!" `
`...After saying that much, Rosa finally noticed that something was odd. `
`Her own rank in this family conference was the lowest of the four siblings. `
`...Why had she been the only one called during an abnormal situation like this, when the other siblings hadn't been? `
`...Even if Maria's name had popped up. `
`"Could it be...huh? `
`...What?!" `
`"...Y-Yes. `
`We tried to contact Krauss-sama, `
`...but we couldn't find him..." `
`"And Madam was not in her room. `
`...Judging by the condition of the sheets, she might not have returned to her bed at all last night." `
`Rosa felt something creepy crawling slowly up her back... `
`"......D-Did you check inside the chapel?" `
`"No, not yet. `
`We tried, but..." `
`"...Actually, the lock to the chapel is special, so the master key will not work. `
`There is a single key that can open it, ...but that key is missing from the key box." `
`She didn't want to get closer to the door with the creepy magic circle if she could. `
`Rosa readied herself and approached, then tried pushing and pulling the knob. `
`...All she felt was the resistance of the sturdy lock. `
`"We searched to see if there was a window we could enter through, but... `
`I think we'd have to break one of the windows if we wanted to check inside... `
`What do you think?" `
`"...There's no way I can give you approval to do something like that. `
`This is Father's precious chapel. `
`........." `
`At that time, the events of the previous day swirled around in the back of Rosa's mind... `
`......That's right, `
`...when I met that witch in the rose garden, `
`...didn't she hand Maria an envelope? `
`Yeah, there's no mistake, she did hand it over. `
`When Maria tried to open it, the witch told her not to do it yet, and then she surely said: `
`"{i:The time to open that will come soon}"... `
`Rosa was sure. `
`...There could be no mistake. `
`...The envelope Maria had received was...... `
`After dashing back to the guesthouse, Rosa approached the cousins' room while hiding her footsteps, `
`softly opened the door, and peered inside... `
`From the inside, she could hear the healthy snores typical of young people. `
`There were four children. `
`And Maria was there. `
`...Sleeping soundly. `
`After breathing a sigh of relief, she entered the room with quiet footsteps. `
`...She was after Maria's handbag, which was resting on the sofa. `
`Maria always liked carrying her treasures around with her. `
`...She was probably emulating how her mother always carried her makeup with her. `
`Of course, she was just imitating her mother, so everything on the inside was junk. `
`In Maria's case, it was full of small, creepy, occult items, notebooks describing things of that nature, and so on. `
`...Rosa had never been happy to see her daughter walking around with things like that, which weren't girlish at all. `
`However, trying to force Maria to stop had resulted in a big fight, so she'd decided to let it be. `
`".........Here. `
`......This is it......" `
`A Western envelope with the crest of the gold eagle... `
`When she took it out of the bag, she realized there was a heavy, vaguely cylindrical object inside. `
`...She could tell by its feel and its weight. `
`...There was no doubt. `
`This was...a key. `
`After turning around and checking that Maria was still sound asleep, `
`Rosa tore open the envelope, and the contents spilled out into her palm. `
`...It was a key with an old and intricate design... `
`Rosa gripped that key and dashed out. `
`...Battler seemed to have noticed that sound, but after grumbling and turning over in his sleep, he started snoring again... `
`"...Genji-san, `
`...could this key...be the key to the chapel?" `
`"Where did you... `
`...Yes, this is the key to the chapel." `
`Rosa approached the creepy magic circle once again...and put the key in the keyhole. `
`...There was a strong resistance. `
`After it resisted for a short while, ...it stopped resisting with a clunk. `
`Then, squeaking with a noise that hurt one's ears, ...it slowly, slowly began to open...... `
`"......Is anyone...there......?!" `
`Her voice reverberated throughout the massive room. `
`...Of course, there was no answer. `
`The chapel had a high ceiling, and the air was cold. `
`...And even on this rainy, unsettling day, it felt sacred for some reason... `
`The servants timidly followed after Rosa. `
`"...Rosa-sama, look at that." `
`Kanon noticed it immediately and pointed. `
`...Over there...was the altar. `
`In the place that would normally have a pastor preaching of God's love, there was a table that shouldn't have been there. `
`At first, it looked like a dining table. `
`...There actually were gorgeous plates and utensils placed there, making it look like a child's birthday party or something. `
`Upon closer inspection, the surrounding area had been decorated with pumpkins and black and orange ribbons. `
`They were probably...Halloween decorations. `
`And there were people seated at the table. `
`Three people on each side facing each other, seated in chairs. `
`They could be recognized at a glance. `
`Krauss and his wife, Eva and her husband, and Rudolf and his wife. `
`But if you wanted to be sure, you'd still have to go even closer and check. `
`...Because they seemed almost like dolls. `
`Rosa and the rest had opened the door, entered all at once with the sound of many footsteps, and called out, asking if anyone was there. `
`...And yet, there had been no reaction. `
`...Even if Rosa and the rest assumed they were being ignored, you'd still expect there to be some kind of reaction. `
`...And there hadn't even been that. `
`So at first, it felt like someone had set down some dolls that greatly resembled those people... `
`...By now, it wasn't just Rosa. `
`...Shannon and Kanon, and even Gohda. `
`...They were all fighting frantically with the creepy emotion that grasped their hearts. `
`"...Nii-san...? `
`......Nee-san......?" `
`As she walked towards the altar, she called out again, but there was still no reaction. `
`...Yes, ...by now, Rosa was sure of it. `
`...She was sure these weren't dolls, `
`{i:but the people themselves}...! `
`"......This is......" `
`"........." `
`They grew close enough to see clearly what lay on the table. `
`It still looked like an adorable banquet, reminiscent of a child's birthday party. `
`Plates piled up with sweets, cute pitchers with drinks. `
`All kinds of pumpkin-shaped ornaments... `
`...They were all decorated in a Halloween style, ...and while this probably wasn't the time to be thinking it, Maria would surely have been delighted to see all this. `
`That was the state of the table they sat in front of, apparently asleep... `
`It was an eerie scene, ...as though a small, fun-looking Halloween party had been stopped in time... `
`"...They're all... `
`...sleeping...? `
`......?" `
`When she approached even closer to them, ...she realized that there were snacks scattered all over the floor. `
`Candies, cookies, soda and chocolates, ...all with heavily fantasy-themed packaging... `
`They were all scattered across a carpet covered with blackberry and cranberry jam... `
`"......Wa...uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?!" `
`Rosa and the rest......finally realized what the situation was... `
`It was...a Halloween party. `
`A banquet for those not of this world...! `
`Krauss, Natsuhi, Eva, Hideyoshi, Rudolf, and Kyrie were seated in chairs, apparently asleep, ...but all dead. `
`How could you tell that they were dead and not simply sleeping? `
`That was because... `
`they'd been... `
`v- `
`vertically... `
`...sliced open... `
`...from their chests to their stomachs......! `
`"...K-Krauss-sama......!! `
`Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii...!" `
`".........How...cruel..." `
`The six of them had sat down at a Halloween party, ...before having their stomachs split open, killing them. `
`Then the jam covering the floor...must be what overflowed from their stomachs once they'd stuffed themselves completely, right...? `
`...No!! `
`The contents of their stomachs had been scattered all over the floor!! `
`And that wasn't all. `
`Out of their stomachs, ...it was almost as though...almost as though... `
`as though they'd poured out...!! `
`A-As though snacks had overflowed from there!! `
`Candies and cookies, soda and chocolates... `
`had poured out, stained with blood, and had scattered across the floor!! `
`What could have happened to cause this?! `
`It's almost as though their stomachs were stuffed full to bursting with sweets... `
`and it all poured out when their stomachs split open!! `
`Rosa remembered a certain shocking meal, a turkey that had been served at her own birthday. `
`When it had been cut open with a knife, ...out flowed one of her favorite foods. `
`...But since she hadn't been told what was inside, the deep, deep red ketchup omelet-rice poured out like bloody maggots... `
`pulsing, `
`dripping, `
`slimy, `
`pulpy, `
`squelching!! `
`"Uerreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeechgh!! `
`Eeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!" `
`The trauma of her youth was revived. `
`Rosa felt a monster raging inside her stomach as the acid started to rise. `
`...Unable to hold back, she threw it all up on the floor. `
`Her empty stomach had nothing but stomach acid. `
`The scene in front of her was no fun Halloween party now...! `
`The three couples were enshrined right there, their stomachs vertically wrenched open, `
`wrenched open with a gyuiiiiiiigubaaa. `
`So many snacks had been stuffed in there, `
`pulpy, squishy. `
`Blood and guts and sweets were overflowing onto the floor, `
`...bloodstained, `
`sticky, `
`sticky, `
`sloppy, `
`pulpy, `
`sweet snacks that made your fingers stick together, `
`gummy, `
`gummy, `
`aaah, but stained with entrails, `
`sloppy, `
`pulpy! `
`What was that I stepped on just now, that didn't feel like a candy or a cookie or soda or a chocolate! `
`Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah, I'm scared what did I step on I can't even look at the bottom of my foot!! `
`Aaaaaawaaaakiiiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!! `
`...What a...what a gruesome Halloween Party...!!! `
`From far away, it had looked truly beautiful, fantastical, and fun. `
`But from up close, it was horrible, disgusting, and yet somehow still beautiful...!! `
`"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!" `
`Rosa's wild thoughts tried as best they could to escape her throat with a loud voice that was neither a scream nor a roar... `
`"......Krauss-sama......" `
`"...This is...horrible...just horrible......" `
`"...C-Call an ambulance, `
`...call the police......!" `
`"...Th-That's right, the police... `
`Police, police police police police!!" `
`If a word so tied to reality hadn't come out of Gohda's mouth, Rosa and the rest would probably have found themselves unable to escape that nightmarish party even now. `
`...But it wasn't because they thought the police might be able to do something. `
`If they didn't keep yelling about the police, ...it felt as though another seat might be set up at this demon's party and given to them...!! `
`Their own chests felt like they were expanding unpleasantly from the inside!! `
`Rumbling, `
`churning, `
`...and it was surely because candy was about to overflow from their stomachs!! `
`Rosa, once again tortured by a desire to vomit, threw her stomach acid up on the floor. `
`And then she searched. `
`Searched to see if there was any candy in it!! `
`"...Haah, ......haah, ...haah...!! `
`Eeeeh, ...haah... `
`...A-Anyway!! `
`*cough*, *cough*!!" `
`Rosa coughed violently again, forcefully spitting out the stomach acid that had been burning in her throat. `
`She realized that by now, her whole body had been covered in a filthy sweat... `
`"G-Genji-san, Shannon-chan, please contact Father and ask for instructions. `
`Gohda-san, go with Kanon-kun and call the police. `
`...Then, have Doctor Nanjo come here..." `
`Why even bring Doctor Nanjo here? `
`It's a bit too late for medical care...! `
`The servants accepted their orders and dashed outside. `
`After watching them leave, ......Rosa once again stared at her siblings, with whom she'd spent good times and bad, and their partners. `
`Though there could be nothing more tragic than this scene, `
`...for some reason, she was tempted to describe these fantastical deaths as beautiful...... `
`"...They aren't here. `
`Where'd they go?" `
`"The servant room and the kitchen are both empty. `
`...What in the world happened?" `
`"Uu-uu-uu-!! `
`Mama!! `
`Where's Mama?!! `
`My letter! `
`The letter I got from Beato! `
`Give it back! `
`Give it baaaack!! `
`Waaauau!!" `
`"Perplexing. `
`...Battler-kun, are you sure it was Aunt Rosa?" `
`"...Well, even I was half-asleep, so I'm not too sure, `
`but I get the feeling that, in the early morning, Aunt Rosa came in and fished around in Maria's handbag." `
`"...I figured there was probably a tube of toothpaste or something in there." `
`"Why would there be a tube of toothpaste in Maria's handbag? `
`Looks like you were a little more than half-asleep." `
`Battler vaguely remembered Rosa entering the cousins' room. `
`Also, when Maria woke up before the rest of them, she'd started rampaging around, saying that someone had opened the envelope she'd been keeping safe. `
`...Putting two and two together, they figured that Rosa had probably come and opened the envelope. `
`"...A letter from the Golden Witch... `
`I wonder what was inside." `
`"I don't know. `
`...But that envelope was for Grandfather's personal use, and it had the Ushiromiya family crest on it. `
`......Whatever was inside it must've had some connection to the family conference." `
`She hadn't let anyone touch it, but yesterday, Maria had shown that envelope off to Battler and the rest a whole lot. `
`...So they remembered it well. `
`"Uu-uu-uu-!! `
`Mama, give it back! `
`Mama, give it back!! `
`Uu-uu-uu-! `
`Waauuuuuuuuuuuuu!!" `
`"...Well, if you're right, it'd have to be pretty important... `
`...Why would this mighty witch give something that important to Maria? `
`...I don't get it." `
`Every once in a while, the refreshing morning atmosphere was completely wiped out by the sound of thunder. `
`...It was only natural. `
`Since the moment they'd woken up, they hadn't met anyone else. `
`It felt like only they were left, as if the mansion had become an empty husk. `
`"...Heeeeey! `
`Anyone there?! `
`Answer me!" `
`Jessica called out into the hallway, and eventually, an answer came back. `
`It came from the entrance hall. `
`"I can hear you. `
`...Has something happened?" `
`"It's Doctor Nanjo. `
`...Thank goodness. `
`It looks like everyone but us hasn't disappeared from this island after all." `
`"Doctor Nanjo, good morning. `
`...Umm, sorry, but do you know where our parents went...?" `
`"Dear me. `
`...I only just woke up and came here, you see. `
`I have no way of knowing for sure, but let's see..." `
`It was only natural. `
`Nanjo was a guest just like the rest of them. `
`He'd come just now to pass the time in the parlor until breakfast. `
`"Uu-uu-uu-!! `
`Doctor Nanjo, Mama took it, Mama took my letter!! `
`Give it back, give it back, uu-uu-uu-!!!" `
`Maria buried her face in Nanjo's plump stomach, sobbing and crying. `
`...Nanjo could do nothing but be bewildered by this ruckus so early in the morning. `
`"......Ah. `
`Someone's running this way. `
`Jessica! `
`Someone's coming!" `
`From down the hall, they could sense people running hurriedly. `
`They saw Gohda and Kanon coming towards them. `
`...Normally, it would be disgraceful for a servant to run inside the mansion. `
`And yet, Battler and the rest didn't even think to question that now. `
`Maria's sobbing had become so unmanageable, they wanted to ask someone--anyone--where Rosa was. `
`But the two servants seemed to have bigger things on their minds than Jessica, who was waving at them. `
`Gohda flew into the servant room, and when Kanon noticed that Nanjo was there, he bowed and approached the doctor at a quick pace before whispering something into his ear. `
`"......What did you say? `
`Rosa-san did?" `
`"Yes. `
`I will guide you, so please accompany me." `
`"Understood..." `
`"This way." `
`Without saying anything more than that, Kanon finally noticed Jessica and bowed to her. `
`...But he wasn't calm. `
`He dashed back down the corridor by which he had come, followed by Nanjo. `
`By looking at how hurried they were, Battler and the rest realized that yes, something bad really had happened. `
`They saw Gohda through the door to the servant room, which had been flung open. `
`...He was holding the receiver and violently pressing the hook. `
`From that, they realized that he was trying to call a hospital or the police. In any event, he was trying to call someone because a serious emergency had occurred. `
`"Let's have a look...!" `
`"Yeah...!" `
`"Mama, give it back!! `
`Give back my letter!! `
`It's {i:an invitation to the Golden Land}!!" `
`They didn't know what, but something was happening. `
`Battler and the rest chased after Kanon and Nanjo... `
`Aaah, ...and then we realized. `
`Kanon-kun had called Doctor Nanjo, but he hadn't called us. `
`...So we shouldn't have gone with them. `
`I wonder if Alice regretted her excess curiosity when she chased after that rabbit holding a clock... `
`"No, you mustn't go in!! `
`You mustn't look!! `
`Jessica-chan! `
`No!!" `
`"Hii... `
`......n- `
`noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!" `
`"Mother, Father!! `
`What...what happened!! `
`Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!" `
`"...What the hell is this... `
`...This goes way beyond bad taste... `
`Isn't taking someone's life bad enough...? `
`......What the hell is this!!" `
`Going to all the trouble after they died of sitting them on chairs, slicing their stomachs and pulling their entrails out?!! `
`You went to all the trouble of stuffing their stomachs full of sweets?!! `
`Why...why the hell would you do something so fucked up?!! `
`Damn it, damn it! `
`Nice job, you bastard, just great, just great!! `
`Gyyaaaaaaaaggghh!!" `
`"......It would be best if everyone went outside...! `
`They certainly wouldn't want you all to see them like this..." `
`Nanjo told the children to go outside, but no one listened. `
`"Rosa-san, please tell them. `
`If they keep looking at something like this, ...it will do nothing but harm...!" `
`"........." `
`Rosa regretted her own carelessness. `
`...She should've realized that the children would eventually come here. `
`...She should've quickly locked up instead of standing around stunned. `
`So the children had come here. `
`They had seen it...! `
`Surely, at this very moment, they were having a sight burned into their eyes... `
`that was far more grotesque than the shocking meal Rosa had witnessed in her youth... `
`While she hugged Maria, who seemed to be too shocked to show any emotion at this gruesome scene, `
`Rosa cried for them and their parents. `
`The four groaning and crying voices, their sadness, ...continued to echo in a place that should have known God's love... `
`"You piece of crap!! `
`Again?! Another one of these murders?!! `
`And this time you made it all elaborate, killing them like it's a total joke!!" `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* `
`I was rather hoping you'd thank me, not cry out in grief." `
`"Thank you?!! `
`Did you say I should thank you, you old bitch?! `
`Damn it, if there's something wrong with your ears, I'll cut them both off so you can hear better!! `
`Why should I have to see that insane way of killing and say "Oh, thank you very much {f:5:Beatrice}-sama"?! I'll beat your brains out!!!" `
`"In the last game, `
`you lamented the fact that you couldn't see your parents faces after they died, yes? `
`So this time, I left them. `
`Didn't touch them!! `
`{i:Take a good look, for without a doubt, your father and the rest have been killed}!! `
`"R...eally, what a nice treat, I'm so fucking happy!! `
`I swore I'd plow your face after I choked the life out of you, but I'll take that back now. I'll rip out your guts instead!!!" `
`"Don't give in to emotion, don't stop thinking. `
`My game has already begun, right? `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle* `
`I decided to leave you neat and tidy corpses this time." `
`"Do you know why? `
`When you denied my existence in the last game, `
`you used this line of thinking..." `
`"{i:"Their faces were crushed, so the identity of the corpses can't be confirmed.}" `
`"{i:Therefore, we can't eliminate the possibility that fake corpses were prepared to create an alibi.}" `
`"{i:Unless that possibility's denied, a human culprit theory can still be built!!}"" `
`"What'd you saaaaaay...?!!" `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*kikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikikiki!! `
`So, Battler, is it okay to leave the examination of the corpses to Nanjo? `
`Isn't it traditional in mystery novels for the doctor who performs such examinations to be an accomplice?" `
`"Then don't leave the examination to him. Do it yourself. `
`Make completely sure that without a doubt, the six corpses are the six people they're supposed to be, that they really, really are dead, not just pretending!!" `
`"If you wish to confirm that your Father and Mother have been killed by having their stomachs cut open and their entrails pulled out, `
`you'd better stick your hand inside their stomachs and feel around!! `
`Kuhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha, ki-hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!" `
`"I won't cry!!! `
`Damn it, damn it, ...I won't cry...!!" `
`Battler suddenly yelled. `
`His tears were still dripping down, but as though scolding himself for being a sissy, he slapped his face hard several times with both hands. `
`Even so, the tears still wouldn't stop. `
`...However, he felt a hot blaze in both his eyes. `
`"Whoever's responsible for this piece of work, I'll make them pay back their debt completely!! `
`So this isn't the time to cry, gotta think about what to do!! `
`Aaaah, it's useless, it's all useless!! `
`If you've got enough time to cry, then think! `
`This is no time to let yourself cry!!" `
`Rather than genuine anger, maybe it was more of an evasive anger to blot out his sadness. `
`...However, it gave a little courage to George and Jessica, who'd been crushed by the sadness. `
`"...That's right. `
`...Even if we cry, `
`...it won't change the reality... `
`of what has happened." `
`"Damn it, ...damn it damn it damn it, ...damn it damn it damn it!! `
`Then what should we do?! `
`What should I do...for Mom and Dad's sakes?!!" `
`"...Rosa-sama... `
`I have returned..." `
`"Gohda-san, what happened with the police? `
`What did they say to do? `
`Did they say when they think they'll be able to get here?" `
`"...As to that, ...it seems the phones have broken down... `
`I also tried the emergency wireless, but...umm, maybe it's the weather, but that isn't working either..." `
`"What did you say...?! `
`So, we can't contact the police?!" `
`"It's that person! `
`They did something to the phone line, made it so we can't reach the cops!!" `
`When she heard that the phones had broken down, Jessica immediately decided that it was the work of that mysterious guest. `
`Her eyes were bright-red after so much crying, and they began to grow even redder with rage. `
`"...Gah, there's no need to talk about it, right?! `
`I understand everything, that's right, I get it! `
`Who killed Dad and Mom?!" `
`"It's obviously her!! `
`It's gotta be that witch or whatever who came yesterday!!! `
`I'll grab her by the collar!! `
`Damn it damn it damn iiiiiiiiiiiit!!" `
`"Jessica-chan...! `
`Wait! `
`Gohda-san, Kanon-kun, go!" `
`"Y-Yes Ma'am...!" `
`"Milady, wait...!" `
`Covering her uncontrollable sadness with anger, Jessica ran outside, torn apart by emotion. `
`...Thinking about it hastily, maybe the mystery guest who'd arrived yesterday, {f:5:Beatrice}, was suspicious. `
`However, in that instant, there was absolutely no proof that she was the culprit. `
`...At this moment, she's just another guest, no more, no less. `
`So Rosa, making an adult decision, was forced to stop Jessica in her rash rampage. `
`Gohda and Kanon picked up on this immediately and chased after her. `
`"...Could the guest that no one invited, {f:5:Beatrice}, be the culprit...?" `
`"I understand how Jessica feels. `
`...I wish I could think that too. `
`It doesn't matter who, I want someone to be the culprit so I can bash them right in the face!! `
`...But before that, we need a clear understanding of what's going on. `
`...Who is this {f:5:Beatrice}? `
`I haven't even seen her face!!" `
`"...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi. `
`If you're looking for her face, it decorates the big portrait in the mansion. `
`You still don't remember after looking at it for so long? `
`Kihihihihihi." `
`"...Come on, Maria. `
`...What's so funny in a situation like this?!" `
`"{f:5:Beatrice} is a witch. `
`And the ceremony to open the door to the Golden Land has finally begun. `
`Those six people are sacrifices. `
`...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi! `
`Come, let us begin the witch's banquet. `
`Tonight is Halloween, so now the witches will gather to celebrate. `
`Ki-hihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!!" `
`"Maria, how many times have I told you to stop laughing in that creepy voice!" `
`The crisp sound of Rosa slapping Maria's cheek echoed through the high-ceilinged chapel... `
`Ever since it started raining yesterday... `
`No, ...ever since the island was swallowed by the typhoon, I've felt as though something...was wrong. `
`It was bright and sunny when I arrived on Rokkenjima, but since I'd gotten up early and was sleepy, I took a nap. `
`...When I woke up, it had already started raining. `
`And ever since that time... `
`Suddenly, a mysterious visitor calling herself the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} arrived, and it felt like I was sinking bit by bit into a bizarre world. `
`What the heck happened while I was napping? `
`Am I supposed to believe this island was sealed off inside a different world, where common sense doesn't apply...?! `
`Who is this person called {f:5:Beatrice}? `
`Is some unknown person trying to involve themselves with the inheritance problem, just like our parents were freaking out about at dinner last night? `
`...Or is the culprit this witch from the Legend of the Gold, just like Maria said?! `
`Even if we set Jessica's temper aside, given the circumstances, it's probably safe to say that this visitor person is the most suspicious. `
`But we mustn't make up our minds based on that alone. `
`Aaah, it's useless, it's useless, it's all useless...!! `
`I smacked my face with both hands again, cooling off my brains before they overloaded. `
`Even though it might've been a wasted effort... `
`"...This......is one of Grandfather's envelopes." `
`On a tray piled up with sweets that decorated the table, George-aniki found a Western envelope that had the Ushiromiya family crest done on it in gold leaf. `
`And, it was unopened. `
`"Which means...it's probably meant for us, right? `
`If it was something Dad and the others read, it should be open." `
`"...It seems your reasoning is correct. `
`...It's written right here. `
`Someone wrote "to those who remain"." `
`"Is that...a letter the culprit left...?! `
`Wh-What's inside...?" `
`"Aniki, let's open it...!" `
`After nodding silently, George-aniki broke the seal. `
`...A folded letter came out. `
`"......I'll read it. `
`......Welcome to Rokkenjima, members of the Ushiromiya family. `
`I am {f:5:Beatrice}, the alchemist for this family employed by Kinzo-sama himself..." `
`That letter really was a joke. `
`This {f:5:Beatrice}, who called herself the family alchemist, had announced that she was collecting the gold she'd lent Grandfather, along with interest. `
`And that interest...was everything Grandfather had created. `
`Since this tragedy was right before our eyes as this paragraph was being read aloud, it clearly wasn't referring just to the wealth that Grandfather had built up. `
`...It was literal. `
`Everything that Grandfather had created... `
`...In other words, ...all of Grandfather's descendants were included in the interest! `
`"You bastard!! `
`What a screwed up contract! `
`Lives as interest for gold, you say?! `
`That's almost like a contract with the devil, isn't it?! `
`You think that makes you look more like a witch?! `
`Ha, don't make me laugh!!" `
`"...Special clause. `
`......However, if someone is able to discover the hidden gold of this contract, {f:5:Beatrice} must abandon these rights for all time." `
`"......Hmm... `
`...Kinzo-sama has already publicly displayed the location of the hidden gold within the epitaph under my portrait..." `
`"...In other words, it's something like this. `
`If these murders represent her collecting interest, `
`then she's telling us to try and find the gold she gave Grandfather if we want her to stop... `
`And, she's also saying that the secret pointing to the gold is hidden in the portrait epitaph." `
`"So, basically, ...this is a letter of challenge from the witch? `
`She's telling us to try and solve the code that points to the hidden gold, if we can?! `
`And if we can't, she'll keep collecting the interest as planned?" `
`"I'll beat you to death, bring it on!!!" `
`"...B-Battler-kun! `
`Look, ...look!!!" `
`The table was covered with sweets, `
`...so even though those things were right out in the open, we just assumed they were sweets too. `
`...I mean, come on, you see them a lot, right? `
`...You know, those boxes of chocolate shaped like gold ingots...! `
`"...Th-This is no box of candy... `
`It's the real thing...! `
`This is a real gold bar...!!" `
`"...It's inscribed with the crest of the One-Winged Eagle... `
`...I heard Mother talking about this earlier. `
`...This is a gold bar from Grandfather's Legend of the Gold...!!" `
`Gold ingots weighing a full 10 kilograms...a whole three of them...were piled up in the very center of the table! `
`It was where a cake would be placed if it was a birthday party. `
`...In other words, this was without a doubt the birthday cake of the party known as the family conference! `
`"If these are really four‐nines‐purity ingots... `
`...nn, *gulp*. `
`They, they're worth about 60 million yen!" `
`"You stupid biiiiiitch!! `
`That's way too cheap!!! `
`Six of our parents have been killed, and the gold you throw our way for it is a measly 60 million yen?! `
`Don't take us for fools, damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!!" `
`"...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi. `
`...So, it has begun, {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`...It's not like anyone can solve this riddle anyway. `
`So Beato will definitely win." `
`"...Quickly, open the door to the Golden Land. `
`And take me with you. `
`...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!" `
