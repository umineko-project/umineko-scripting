`Battler's figure was in the dining hall. `
`He didn't feel like going back to the guesthouse in the middle of all this rain... `
`and wandered halfheartedly around the mansion in search for any place where he could sit, ...before setting up camp in the dining hall. `
`He didn't even lock the door. `
`He thought the shapeless murderer, or maybe the Golden Witch, might come to kill him now that he was isolated, `
`but he no longer had any desire to resist. `
`He didn't even feel like using a locked door to hold off the culprit. `
`He wanted that person to come at him openly, from the front. `
`...If it was the killer, he wanted to ask them about some of those wonderful closed room tricks as a parting gift. `
`If it was the witch, he hoped she'd at least take his life with some spectacular magic. `
`...However, ironically, neither of these two came to meet him... `
`Battler opened the liquor cabinet on his own and enjoyed the liquor to his heart's content. `
`No longer was there anyone to scold him for drinking alcohol. `
`He boldly rested his legs on the extravagant tablecloth and savored the high-quality liquor, which probably had a mind-boggling price, drinking it down straight from the bottle... `
`Then, ...someone knocked. `
`Battler realized that someone had finally come to greet him... `
`"Hey, it's not locked. `
`Whoever you are, please come in. `
`And go ahead and introduce yourself. `
`If you're human, please gimme your name. `
`If you're Beatrice, please tell me your bust size." `
`"I may not look it, but I'm well known as a breast-sommelier, you see? ...Hic." `
`"......It is Genji, Battler-sama." `
`"...Genji-san, huh? `
`...Sorry, but I've got no interest in your bust size. `
`Please, come in. It's unlocked." `
`"......Excuse me." `
`Genji-san opened the door and bowed. `
`......So, is Genji-san the criminal after all, ...or maybe an accomplice? `
`...That theory would probably explain most of the tricks... `
`"Did you come to give me my last rites?" `
`"......Nothing of the sort. `
`...I apologize if I am disturbing you." `
`"...Hey, hey, saying I'm sorry without even telling me what you want is actually pretty creepy. `
`...What do you want? `
`...Are you gonna tell me that drinking alcohol is forbidden for minors? I'll just die anyway.` ...Please, let me do what I want, now that it's all about to end." `
`"......Battler-sama, do you love alcohol so much... `
`that you would spend the little time you have left drinking?" `
`Those words...pierced me... `
`...That wasn't true. `
`"............... `
`I just...can't cope if I don't drink. `
`...I can't even taste the alcohol at all..." `
`"...You are just like the Master. `
`Indeed, you inherited the Master's blood strongly..." `
`"You mean Grandfather, the heavy drinker, was drinking to drown his sorrows the whole time...? `
`First I've heard of it." `
`......After a number of sad incidents, `
`the Master's life... `
`was reduced to one of atonement alone." `
`"...What is it you know?" `
`"......Beatrice's ceremony was completed when the eighth twilight ended. `
`...I believe I can tell you everything now." `
`"...Wh-What did you say...?" `
`My drunkenness was completely blown away. `
`I lowered my feet from the table and listened carefully to hear what Genji would say next... `
`"Battler-sama, `
`...I shall guide you to the Master's study. `
`...It would probably be best to hear it directly from both the Master and..." `
`"From both Grandfather...and...? `
`H-Hey, what in the world do you mean by that...?!!" `
`"...Come, this way. `
`I shall guide you, `
`Battler-sama." `
`After Genji-san told me to follow him, he started to walk down the corridor. `
`I threw my drunkenness off completely and went after him... `
`We climbed a big staircase......towards the third floor. `
`Genji-san stopped walking halfway. `
`He then turned back and spoke. `
`"......Battler-sama, `
`...from here on, `
`......you will probably see things you will not be able to understand." `
`"Don't think that'll scare me. `
`......I've already seen enough incomprehensible things today to make me sick." `
`"......Please, accept what you see as you see it... `
`and accept what you hear as you hear it." `
`"Why? `
`What? `
`...There is no need for questions like that. `
`...You will learn the truth, and that is all. `
`I will leave it completely up to you, Battler-sama, `
`whether to accept it, believe it, or deny it." `
`".................." `
`Genji-san checked one last time to see whether I was prepared to know the truth. `
`The eighth twilight had already ended. `
`And on the ninth twilight, the witch would revive, ...and nobody would be left alive. `
`It meant that Beatrice had already been revived. `
`...And, it probably also meant that none of us would be allowed to return alive. `
`If I was going lose my life anyway, ...I wanted to know the truth in the end. `
`...It didn't matter how hard it might be to accept. `
`".........Yeah. `
`...Even if a demon or a witch shows up, ...I'm prepared." `
`"......Indeed, you are just like the Master in his youth. `
`...Battler-sama, please be diligent in your studies. `
`In the future, you will surely have great aspirations. `
`And when that time comes, see to it that you are never forced to regret a lack of study and training." `
`"......I'd be happy to, assuming I ever get a chance to work hard in my studies." `
`"..............." `
`Genji-san's silence felt like it was further confirming a certain resigned feeling I had... `
`And then, ......the door to Grandfather's study, surrounded by a sweet smell, came into sight. `
`Genji-san took a gold key with an elegant design out from his pocket. `
`The master keys had been confiscated by Aunt Rosa, but he'd kept the key to this study alone on his person. `
`He put it in the keyhole, ......and it made a heavy clunking sound. `
`"......Master, `
`it is I, Genji. `
`I have brought Battler-sama with me." `
`There was no reply, but it seemed that permission to go inside had been given... `
`"Come, Battler-sama. `
`...Please, go in." `
`".........Okay. `
`...I'll go in." `
`I readied myself...and threw the door open... `
`At that moment, ...I got slightly disoriented by the dazzling golden glow...... `
`It was......unbelievably... `
`...a swarm of butterflies that shone gold. `
`The gold butterflies that completely filled the inside of the study poured out all at once... `
`" Wha-...... `
`...What is... `
`...this......?" `
`It was almost like golden leaf confetti. `
`The interior of Grandfather's study was filled with a golden glow... `
`And, ...on a sofa like a reception chair in front of the study desk, `
`......I could see Grandfather's back. `
`There was someone on the side opposite from Grandfather. `
`...It was in shadow, so I couldn't see it well... `
`"...Master, `
`I've brought Battler-sama." `
`"......Battler, is it? `
`I'm busy thinking now... `
`Be silent for a while..." `
`Kinzo declared that unhappily, his back still turned. `
`It seemed he was enjoying a chess game with a visitor... `
`Apparently, the opponent had counterattacked with a superb move. `
`Kinzo seemed to be enjoying himself as he thought deeply, while occasionally laughing and groaning... `
`"I have thought for 30 years. `
`...I have thought for 30 years about how to counter this move... `
`Have fun, have fun with the move I have fermented for 30 years." `
`"...Heheheheheheheh. `
`Indeed, this is a deeply matured move. `
`...What fun, what fun, ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, hahahahahahaha...!! `
`I see I'm no match for you." `
`"...Wh... `
`...What is... `
`...this......?!" `
`"So you came, Battler. `
`I've been waiting for a while. `
`Be silent for Kinzo's sake. `
`...Isn't it too early to resign, Kinzo? `
`I could've countered that move in several ways already. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!" `
`It should have been... `
`my first meeting with that witch. `
`However, ...I knew this witch. `
`Even though it was our first meeting, `
`.........I knew her...... `
`from the portrait...! `
`"Genji, `
`serve some alcohol for Battler. `
`What would be an appropriate liquor for this man...?" `
`"...That which the Master has loved since the days of his youth." `
`"Good, good, serve it. `
`...You did well coming here, Ushiromiya Battler. `
`First, sit down. `
`......You called my name many times, did you not? `
`In deference to that, I allowed you to meet me. `
`...So, what will you ask me? `
`What will you inquire? `
`...The door of the Golden Land will soon be opened. `
`Soon, we will have a banquet to celebrate my revival, at which I will be welcoming in the witches. `
`...In the meantime, I'll answer your questions, as many as you like." `
`"...I-I've got a bunch of things I wanna ask!! `
`What happened on this island?! `
`And why did incidents like these occur?! `
`I want to ask about the closed rooms too!! `
`What about the chapel?! `
`What about Jessica's room?! `
`And the servant room?! `
`And Aunt Natsuhi's room?! `
`And the parlor?!" `
`"There's so much more I wanna ask!! `
`About the witch's true nature!! `
`Is Beatrice really a witch?!! `
`What's your goal, what do you want to make us do and why did you call me here?!! `
`Answer me, about everything!!!" `
`"Aaaaahh, be quiet!! `
`You think you'll get answers if you ask?!?!" `
`"Don't say that, Kinzo. `
`A fragile and fleeting spider web did offer protection from King Herod once. `
`...Just like there are no useless things in this world, there are also no useless questions." `
`"Veeery well, I'll answer all your questions. `
`...But, only on one condition." `
`"What is it?" `
`"If you hear everything and are able to accept my existence, `
`......then you will kneel and kiss my shoes. `
`I called you here because I wanted to make you surrender to me." `
`"...Kinzo and I made a bet. `
`We bet on which would come first, Kinzo thinking of a new move, or me making you surrender. `
`I don't think I'll lose. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!" `
`"...D-Damn you, talking so tough!! `
`Yeah, all right. `
`Try and convince me. `
`...Try and convince me that you're a witch who can use weird, awesome, powerful magic!!" `
`"If I surrender, I'll kiss you or do anything else!!!" `
`The witch cackled gloatingly. `
`Then, she glared at him unpleasantly with eyes that said a man can't go back on his word... `
`"Well said!! `
`So, from what question shall I begin?! `
`I'll answer everything!! `
`Come, what will the first one be?!?!" `
