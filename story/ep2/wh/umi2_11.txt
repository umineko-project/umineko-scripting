`"......I see. `
`So it has begun." `
`"...Yes." `
`"............" `
`Even though Kinzo had received news of six deaths, his emotions did not waver. `
`The expression on his face as he gazed out the window...was a smile, as though his opponent in a chess game had just made a spectacular move. `
`...It was hard to imagine that such an expression could ever appear on a father who had lost so many children at once. `
`"...Gohda and Kanon followed Rosa-sama's orders and went to call the police. `
`After that, she ordered us to follow your orders, Master... `
`...What shall we do?" `
`"......This island has already been cut off from the real world. `
`Mere phones will serve no purpose." `
`"Should I have them stop?" `
`"...Until the roulette is finished, what they do to pass the time is up to them. `
`Let them do as they please." `
`"......Yes sir." `
`"...Umm, `
`...what we should tell Rosa-sama?" `
`"Didn't I say they should pass the time as they pleased?!! `
`They can sing if they want, dance if they want! `
`They're even free to hang themselves by the neck or jump into a boiling kettle!! `
`Until 13 people die, they can spend their time as they like. `
`If that's too boring, then they can wonder about whether 6 times 9 is 42, or something!! `
`That's the answer to the mystery of humanity and the universe!!" `
`"Y-Yes...! `
`M-My apologies...!" `
`Shannon cowered in fright at this sudden rage. `
`...Genji made a gesture as though telling her not to speak out of turn. `
`Shannon couldn't help but regret saying too much... `
`"However, `
`...you two are also free to do as you wish. `
`...Genji. `
`And Shannon too. `
`You have done well serving me until today." `
`"Y-Your words are too good for me, `
`...but, umm......" `
`"......We are furniture who have sworn to serve the Master. `
`...We stand ready to serve you no matter the time. `
`...Until the very end." `
`"...... `
`............I want to tell the two of you... `
`about everything. `
`......Shannon. `
`I shall be writing a will. `
`Please copy what I say. `
`...Genji, please, my usual drink." `
`"Huh...? `
`......Y-Yes sir...!" `
`Nanjo often recommended that Kinzo write a will because of his health, but each time he had, Kinzo had gone mad with rage. `
`...Ever since then, you'd think 'will' would've been the word Kinzo hated most. `
`After hearing such a word come from his lips, Shannon couldn't help doubting her ears for an instant. `
`Shannon hurriedly prepared the side table and some writing paper. `
`Genji followed his orders and began preparing that usual green, evil drink... `
`"I'm ready." `
`"......Hmm. `
`......Where should I begin? `
`...Shall I also speak of my life? `
`...It would be fun to leave behind a record of my most memorable games. `
`......It can be truly amusing to read the records of old games from centuries past, ...to journey in search of those players' thoughts. `
`......So, should the game record of my life lead those in the future to go on a journey in search for my thoughts? `
`...Hmph." `
`For a while, Kinzo pondered over where he should begin, strutting all over the room with his hands behind his back... `
`"Master, `
`......here." `
`"Ah, yes. `
`Thank you, my friend. `
`......Well then. `
`If I am to speak of my life, I must begin by writing of my meeting with that witch. `
`...Shannon, begin writing. `
`...My first meeting with Beatrice took place a long way back. `
`What year of the Showa era was it...? `
`...It must have been...at the end of the war, so..." `
`We took enough time to regain our calm, `
`......and we each swore to our parents that we'd catch the culprit. `
`It would be a lie to say we weren't still torn up. `
`...Even now, if we let our guards down just a little, we'd probably start going on a rampage just like Jessica, letting our emotions show with some kind of violence. `
`According to what Gohda-san said after he got back, right now, Kanon-kun was looking after Jessica. `
`...Apparently, she was still very emotionally high-strung. `
`"...I see. `
`Thank you. `
`...Maybe a young kid would be better at understanding a young kid's feelings. `
`...It would probably be better if we left them alone for now." `
`"Rosa-san, `
`...there is nothing more to be gained by remaining here. `
`...The phones may not be working, but tomorrow, the boat will come, and we should be able to reach the police. `
`We should leave this place as it is for the police's investigation." `
`"...I agree with Doctor Nanjo. `
`...Staying in a place like this for too long will be bad for your health. `
`...Let us return and make some black tea..." `
`"......Yeah. `
`...I agree with that. `
`...Battler-kun, George-kun, are you ready...? `
`Let's lock up here. `
`We ought to leave this place as it is anyway, for when the police come." `
`"You're right. `
`......Battler-kun, ...are you okay...?" `
`"...Yeah. `
`...I've cried all I can. `
`...I'm fine now." `
`The police would surely find some evidence during their thorough investigation. `
`...But we weren't adult enough to wait for that. `
`...I'd investigated the chapel in my own way, trying to grab the culprit before the police arrived. `
`...And what I figured out was...absolutely nothing, frustratingly. `
`...I wasn't able to find a single hint. `
`"Come on, ...let's go out. `
`...Maria, we're going. `
`...Don't keep staring at it...!" `
`"...Uu-." `
`"Come, come, Maria-sama. `
`Let us return... `
`It's cold here." `
`"......Father, Mother. `
`...Thank you for everything. `
`I will...definitely become a man who doesn't betray your expectations..." `
`George spoke his last words of farewell to his parents. `
`...After seeing that, Battler followed suit. `
`"...Dad, Kyrie-san." `
`Just looking at their faces, ...it looked like they were sleeping, ...but that just made it even more painful... `
`"......Forgive me for leaving you in a cold place like this... `
`......I'll definitely get whoever did this... `
`No matter what..." `
`"...What is...this? `
`What a repulsive scribble... `
`Did the culprit draw it?" `
`"This is worse than vulgar... `
`...How horrible..." `
`When the door to the chapel was closed, we learned about that creepy scribble for the first time. `
`"When we first found this, it was already drawn here. `
`...It must have been made by the culprit..." `
`"...So supposedly, the culprit was a witch, and this is a magic circle to summon a demon or something...?" `
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihi... `
`This is the seventh magic circle of the sun. `
`Don't you even know that...? `
`Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi. `
`Ouch." `
`"Hey!! `
`Don't I always tell you not to make that creepy laugh?!!" `
`"Maria, go on. `
`...What does it mean?" `
`"It's a magic circle to escape from physical or mental bonds. `
`...And the part written around the circumference says, 'The Lord has freed me from my chains. `
`I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call on the name of the Lord', in Hebrew." `
`"...Sacrifice of thanksgiving...? `
`So, they killed Father and the rest to use them as human sacrifices for this magic circle...?!" `
`"Calm down, George-kun...! `
`This is the culprit trying to provoke us. `
`...I'm sure it doesn't mean anything. `
`Thinking about it will only poison the heart." `
`"...And, looks like there's some English written here. `
`...<Happy Halloween for...Maria>. `
`...I get it. `
`And the key to open this door was handed over to Maria... ...Is that what's going on?" `
`"...Well, this is the chapel, after all. `
`Maybe Maria doesn't mean Maria-chan, but the Virgin Mary. `
`...In that case, you could read this as a blasphemy against God, in the name of Halloween. `
`They say witches who make contracts with demons swear to defile God's name at all times. `
`...In that sense, this really is a witch-like crime." `
`"...Sounds like you know a lot about it. `
`...Did you get that from Maria?" `
`"...Yeah, something like that." `
`"The chapel, huh? `
`...They went to all the trouble of calling them out here and killing them... `
`......Aunt Rosa, `
`does this chapel have some special meaning...?" `
`"What do you mean, ...a special meaning?" `
`"Well, umm, `
`......someone carried six human corpses all the way over here and set up these elaborate decorations. `
`...We can't tell if she called the six of them over here before killing them, or if she killed them before carrying them over here, `
`...but either way, it'd take a lot of effort... `
`Why did the culprit ... `
`{i:want six people to die here}...? `
`"...True. `
`By doing something that elaborate, there would be an extremely high chance of some disadvantageous evidence being found when the police arrive. `
`...It is inconceivable that the culprit would fail to realize this. `
`...The issue now... `
`is why the culprit went to all that effort..." `
`"And that leads us to just one question. `
`...What meaning is there to this place, where we found the six corpses?" `
`"...This chapel...was important to Father. `
`...Ever since I was a kid, I was given strict instructions never to enter it." `
`"Uu-. `
`...I came here once too, got in lots of trouble... `
`Uu-..." `
`"An important chapel...? `
`...Does it have some connection to the Ushiromiya Head Family...?" `
`"I don't know. `
`...Father viewed this chapel as very sacred, and he treasured it so much that he had it redecorated several times. `
`...But as everyone knows, `
`Father wasn't a devout believer, as his passion for black magic demonstrates. `
`...I've never heard of him coming here to offer his prayers to God." `
`"...As far as I know, the Master has never come here. `
`We even call this 'the sealed chapel', ...and, umm, `
`I found it eerie, like a haunted house." `
`"Even though Father even never approached it himself, for some reason, he made the servants give it a major cleaning several times a year. `
`It felt like he kept it clean all the time so that it could be used at any moment." `
`"And even so, it's called the 'sealed chapel'... `
`...Ihihi! `
`Maybe it's indiscreet to say this, but doesn't that sound pretty cool? `
`Doctor Nanjo, you're an old friend of Grandfather's, right? `
`Have you heard anything about it?" `
`"......I did ask about it once long ago, but I forget exactly how he dodged my question. `
`...That's right, I believe he said something like... `
`...someday, perhaps I too will be able to receive a blessing there. `
`But unless a miracle occurs, that day will never come." `
`"What does that mean? `
`......What would he do in a chapel? `
`He couldn't mean his own funeral, right?" `
`"I wouldn't believe that of Kinzo-san. `
`...He was a man much more focused on the living now than matters occuring after death. `
`......Though, this does seem to be root cause of the current inheritance problem." `
`"Then what would he do in a chapel? `
`......Pray? `
`Aren't confessions done in a chapel too? `
`.........Anyway, it sounds suspicious." `
`"...I don't know the reason, `
`...but just as Doctor Nanjo said, in Grandfather's eyes, `
`...all this about not being blessed unless a miracle occurred... was set in stone as far back as this chapel's construction." `
`"How do you know that...?" `
`"See, ...it's clearly written over there. `
`...Look, right there." `
`George-aniki pointed to a relief with rusted gold letters on the arch above the door. `
`It looked like some message had been written there in English. `
`...The rust made it clear that the message had been there ever since the chapel's construction. `
`"......I'm not that good with English. `
`...What is it...? `
`...<This door is...opened...only at...probability of>?? `
`Sorry, my English sucks." `
`I gave up after failing to finish even the first of the two lines. `
`...It looked like the others could read it properly. `
`"...Umm, I think it went 'm', 'b', 't', 'q', so, `
`...umm, umm...how many did that mean, I think...umm...hmmm... `
`...... `
`...Anyway, this is incredible. `
`Adding up all the fingers on both hands doesn't even get you close. `
`It really would be impossible unless a miracle occurred." `
`"...Certainly. `
`It's quite reminiscent of the old Kinzo-san, who loved using gambling as a metaphor whenever he got the chance." `
`"Hey, come on, can everyone read it? `
`Someone tell me what it means too." `
`"Kihihihihihihi. `
`...You've gotta at least learn English. `
`How did you get into high school without even being able to read this much? `
`Kihihihihihihihihihi, `
`ouch. `
`Ouch `
`ouch `
`ouch." `
`"Mind your own business. `
`So, what's written there?" `
`"...Simply put, it means something like this: `
`'Unless a miracle occurs, this door will never be opened. `
`Unless a miracle occurs, you will never be blessed'." `
`"...Grandfather's magic is based on astronomically low probabilities. `
`...In other words, a miracle for opening this door...would probably require an incredibly vast amount of magical power. `
`...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi. `
`Ouch." `
`"Nice job, you can shut up now. `
`Rosa-san, did you have Maria take English classes? `
`Looks like it's useless to try and learn English unless you start when you're young after all." `
`"......The sealed chapel, huh? `
`...Setting aside whether she was a witch or not, it's rumored that Beatrice actually existed several decades ago... `
`and was Grandfather's mistress." `
`"This is, umm, just my imagination, `
`...but perhaps the Master truly did love Beatrice-sama. `
`However, he was already married, so they couldn't be united." `
`"...I see. `
`......If Beatrice was dead and could be revived with the magic of a miracle, then now that Grandmother's dead, he could marry her openly. `
`And if they married in this chapel, ......you might end up with a pretty fairy tale-like story, right?" `
`"...I don't think that story is so preposterous. `
`...It's a well-known fact that Father still loves Beatrice deeply. `
`...Also, even though I said I found it creepy, `
`I seem to remember that the interior of the chapel was quite magnificent. `
`......The thought that Father built this chapel in the hopes of having a wedding with his dead mistress...might not be that unlikely." `
`"...By the time he built this chapel, Grandfather probably knew that he would never use it as a church as long as he lived. `
`...But, he prayed for the witch to be revived by some miracle. `
`And he thought that if that miracle occurred, they could be married here..." `
`"...I see. `
`...If you think of it that way, this would be a place of utmost significance to Beatrice-sama as well... `
`Even though he knew the chapel would never be opened. `
`...It's a story of tragic love." `
`Even though Gohda-san was even bigger than me, his words were touching. `
`...Everyone was silent, but it seemed that they agreed with that view. `
`"Even though he knew it was a chapel never to be opened, `
`...he still probably dreamed of the day that a miracle would occur. `
`......Kinzo-san was quite the romantic in his younger days. `
`I think I understand how he felt." `
`"Ihihi. `
`I wonder. `
`...Then again, everyone went in it four times a year to clean, right? `
`So much for it being 'the sealed chapel'. `
`Didn't we just go in ourselves? `
`That wasn't a miracle or anything. `
`We brought the key, click, and we're in. `
`That's all. This is ridiculous." `
`".........Huh? `
`......What?! `
`.........Then, ......what does that mean?" `
`"Wh-What are you talking about...?" `
`As far as I could tell, I'd just been joking around, finding myself a bit irritated by the sob story this was turning into. `
`...But then Aunt Rosa suddenly jumped on me, with a really serious face. `
`Aunt Rosa's face grew increasingly pale. `
`...She looked at the magic circle on the door, and then at her hand, back and forth, back and forth. `
`"...Wh-What is the matter, Rosa-sama...?" `
`"Hey, Gohda-san! `
`The key to this chapel! `
`Didn't Genji-san say it? `
`{i:He said there was only one}! `
`".........Huh? `
`........." `
`"...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi. `
`...It took you all way too long to figure it out. `
`Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi..." `
`...When a kid pulls a prank, it sometimes goes unnoticed by the adults, and the kid who did it gets all disappointed. `
`...If such a prank then gets sprung on someone much later, it can really make a kid's day. `
`...Maria's celebration just now looked a lot like that... `
`"...U-Um, yes, that's right. `
`There is only one of those keys. `
`It's the key to the Master's treasured chapel, so there is only one, with no duplicates. `
`...It is normally kept safe in the key box in the servant room, but..." `
`"That's right. `
`And Genji-san said it had gone missing. `
`...So, someone stole it, ...put it in an envelope, and handed it to Maria?! `
`And they did it yesterday!" `
`"......What the...? `
`So in other words, `
`......isn't that strange?" `
`"...That's absurd. `
`......This is getting bizarre." `
`"Wh-What do you mean...? `
`I don't have a clue what you're talking about..." `
`"Me neither. `
`...Would you explain it for us...?" `
`...Gohda and Nanjo's failure to understand definitely wasn't because they were stupid. `
`...They didn't know. `
`...They didn't know how long the only key to the chapel had been in Maria's possession. `
`"There's no mistake! `
`It was locked up!! `
`I unlocked it!! `
`There's no doubt!!" `
`Aunt Rosa kept closing the door, locking it, pulling on it to check the lock, and opening it again. `
`Her face was becoming pale again... `
`"Until I took the key out of Maria's envelope and opened this door, `
`it was definitely locked!! `
`But this key was in an envelope placed in Maria's care! `
`And that happened yesterday before noon!!!" `
`"......What did you say......?" `
`"But that...doesn't make any sense...!" `
`"You're right. `
`......Maria received a one-of-a-kind key from a woman calling herself a witch midday yesterday. `
`In other words, from midday yesterday until this morning, when Rosa-san unlocked the door, this chapel was a closed room." `
`"......How did they get those six people in here, and then how did they kill them?!" `
`The deaths of six people had shaken us badly. `
`When we learned about that weird magic circle and the history of the chapel, we felt as though we'd figured at least part of this puzzle out. `
`...But that was all absolutely trivial! `
`From midday yesterday until this morning, this chapel was a closed room. `
`But our parents were with us until last night. `
`How did the culprit get into this building?! `
`And how did they lock it up again?! `
`"...What are you trying to pull? `
`...Again? `
`A closed room again?! `
`Are you trying to say you unlocked it with the power of magic?!! `
`Don't take me for a fool!!" `
`"If you're demanding that I show you how to open locks with my power, I wouldn't mind. `
`...But that wouldn't be the same as me forcing you to surrender." `
`"You keep trying to 'explain it all with humans'! `
`Only when I've cornered all your theories completely...will I have my victory!! `
`Come now, how will you undermine my defenses? `
`What trick could a human have used to defeat them, hmm?" `
`"It's just like the closed rooms last time. `
`...Not enough information!! `
`It's impossible to reason like this! `
`Any excuse could be made, any trick could work!! `
`There's no way to reason it out!" `
`"Ha! `
`That again? `
`There's not enough information, so you'll wait and see? `
`Your information is uncertain, so it's impossible to use your reasoning...? `
`Ha, this is always the excuse you humans use to let yourselves stop thinking. `
`Who do you think you are, lowly human?!" `
`"Are you saying you can't even think unless you're like Laplace's demon, you incompetent fool?!! `
`...Besides, you make it seem like a lack of information works against you, but it's the other way around, you see?" `
`"The more information you're given, the more it will make you suffer! `
`It'll only increase the strength of the compressor that's squeezing you! `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!" `
`"Oh, in that case, let me say this. `
`It's impossible to verify that this is a closed room in the first place!! `
`If we're already talking about demons, I can play that game too." `
`"...It'd be possible to prove that this {i:isn't} a closed room. `
`Just show how someone could've gone in or out, and you're done!" `
`"But it's impossible to prove that this {i:is} a closed room!! `
`You could never deny the endless set of possible methods for getting in. `
`In other words, this is one of those Devil's Proofs!! `
`This concept of a closed room is actually something that can never be proved!!" `
`"So, first you stop thinking, with a lack of information as an excuse, and now this. `
`...Very well. `
`If that is your move, then I will accept it. `
`Continue." `
`"First off, it looks like you're trying to claim that the chapel's a closed room. `
`...Just a short while ago, I spent some time looking around in there, and I couldn't find any way in or out except for the door." `
`"...But that {i:just means I couldn't find one}. It doesn't prove it was a closed room!!" `
`"If there's a 'hidden door' or something that I wasn't able to find, your premise would be blown away completely!! `
`In other words, whether I managed to find a hidden door or not, you'll never be able to deny that there existed some method X that'd let you into the closed room!" `
`"And this method X would be something that could be carried out without magic. `
`After all, it's a 'hidden door'! `
`I'm sure that in this chapel, there's some hidden door that's impossible to find. `
`That's why there's no reason for me to reason it out, and magic is still impossible!!" `
`"......Hohoh, so you'll use that logic. `
`*cackle*cackle* How naive. `
`An expected move. `
`Let me make my move in response. `
`...These 'closed rooms' used in detective novels made by mere humans always seem utterly ridiculous to me." `
`"Why? `
`Because they're used the wrong way. `
`...When a closed room appears in a detective novel, do you really think it's a closed room? `
`You don't, do you?!" `
`"{i:What trick did they use to make this look like a closed room}?! `
`That's what you think." `
`"In other words, there hasn't been a completed closed room in the any of closed room murders that humans have built over the last century!!" `
`"Oooh!! `
`Better not say that, unless you wanna face the wrath of the mystery fans! `
`Christie's probably grinding her teeth in her grave!" `
`"Hmph!! `
`But I am different. `
`I have given birth to a true closed room! `
`And I can demonstrate it. `
`Why? `
`Because I am a witch!!" `
`"For the Devil's Proof, you only had to bring someone a demon to prove that they exist, correct? `
`Well, I conveniently happen to be a witch, meaning that demons are my good friends, and I can bring you as many of them as you like!!" `
`"Sounds great!! `
`'Dad and the rest used a hidden door to enter the chapel or were carried in through it'! `
`How do you plan to beat that move?!" `
`"With this. `
`Regardless of whether they were alive or dead, `
`'the six definitely entered through the door'!!" `
`"Huh?!?! `
`Dumbass!! `
`The door was locked, so how'd they do it?!!" `
`"I opened it with magic and invited them inside!!" `
`"That can't be true!! `
`Since I can't accept magic, there's no way I'll accept that!! `
`You're lying!! `
`That door can be opened with some trick. `
`Or maybe there's a hidden door, but I won't accept any other way!!" `
`"...Perpetual check!! `
`That's what we call an endless repetition of moves in chess. `
`It's the same endless repetition as a discussion that won't advance because both sides deny the basis of each other's claims, like our game. `
`...In most games, this would be resolved as a draw, but that would put a terrible damper on our fun!! `
`We will have no draws. `
`You will either accept me and submit to me, or you will deny me!!" `
`"At least I agree with you there!! `
`We'll settle this without fail, just as you wish!!" `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`I like that attitude! `
`......So, I had a thought. `
`I think I'll add a new rule to this game between the two of us." `
`"A new rule?! `
`...I'll bet it's something that'll give you an advantage, right?!" `
`"Of course not. `
`I'll give you the thing people like you always demand. `
`The reason you always stop thinking and then moan about it...is 'a lack of information'! `
`And if you are then given information, you start doubting whether the information is true or not by 'rejecting the source'!" `
`"Isn't that convenient? `
`What clever little words to hide your own incompetence. `
`I'm offering to eliminate that convenient excuse of yours. `
`You should thank me, *cackle*!" `
`"You said they entered through the door, and I said that couldn't happen. `
`...Are you calling that an evasive answer?" `
`"Exactly. `
`So from now on, `
`{p:1:when I speak the truth, I will use red}." `
`"Wh-What is this...?! `
`Keep explaining!" `
`"No matter what magical move I use, `
`you can always keep running away by chanting 'lack of information' and by 'rejecting the source'." `
`"...Even though I would still win in the end that way, it would be extremely boring. `
`...Because of that, I'd be happy to I give you the 'information' and 'sources' you so desire." `
`"However, you'll probably doubt each word I say. `
`That isn't bad in itself. `
`I also will use every possible move to make you submit. `
`I don't dislike our posture of searching out our best moves for our own goals." `
`"...But that won't make a game. `
`So I set up this rule." `
`" `
`{p:1:Everything I speak in red is the truth}! `
`There's absolutely no need to doubt it!" `
`"Are you telling me to believe that...?!" `
`"This is a game between you and me. `
`In a game, the rules are sacred!! `
`Those who take that lightly are not qualified to play!!" `
`"Okay, I get you, I'll accept that rule!! `
`Even an elementary school kid can get into an endless argument and find fault with everything. `
`Then let's start it up again, continuing where we left off. `
`I'll say it one more time. `
`'Dad and the rest used a hidden door to enter the chapel or were carried in through it'!" `
`"Then I shall repeat what I said. `
`"{p:1:Regardless of whether they were alive or dead, `
`the six definitely entered through the door}"!" `
`".........I‐is there any proof? `" `
`"Stop! `
`I will supplement the rule." `
`"...When I speak the truth, I will use red, `
`{i:and when I do, I will not bear the responsibility of establishing that claim by showing proof}! `
`They will simply be facts and the truth!!" `
`"My reason is simple. `
`I carried out all the crimes with magic. `
`So for any impossible crime, all I have to do is wave my magic staff and show you how it's done." `
`"But that wouldn't make a game! `
`It would be as barbaric as ignoring victory and defeat in a chess match and punching your opponent in the face!" `
`"...W-Well, that makes sense. `
`...Since you're a witch, `
`{i:there's no need for you to show evidence for what happened}. `
`...Since you can do anything with magic, dammit... `
`Talk about an unfair game...!" `
`"So, shall we resume once more? `
`The six definitely entered through the door. `
`I unlocked it with magic. `
`...How will you get around this magic, this closed room?!" `
`"...Th-The key! `
`Genji-san and the others said there was only one key, but that's impossible to prove! `
`The culprit secretly made a duplicate key...!" `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*! `
`{p:1:Only one key to the chapel exists}!" `
`"Arg... `
`Th-Then what about this. `
`The culprit made something other than a legitimate key and opened it! `
`I don't know what, but maybe a wire! `
`A tool for picking locks!!" `
`"What is this naive move? `
`{p:1:It is impossible to unlock the lock to the chapel with anything but the chapel's key}!! `
`Although it can be opened with the power of magic, right...?" `
`"Then what about this!! `
`There's something wrong with the door itself! `
`There was some way to pass through it even while it was locked...! `
`As to what that is, I can think of a few ways! `
`Maybe it's like those big doors on a castle that have a smaller door in them! `
`It's also possible that they removed the hinges, and then removed the whole door before entering!!" `
`"Wahahahahahahahahahaha! `
`Is {i:this} the best a century of human wisdom can manage, Battleeeeeeer?! `
`{p:1:When the door to the chapel is locked, it prevents any and all methods of entry or exit}!!" `
`Assuming you can't use magic, right...? `
`*cackle*! `
`Is it about time for checkmate?!" `
`"Not even close!! `
`You said those six people entered through a door, but you didn't say it was the front door! `
`They might've entered through another door, a secret one!!" `
`"You talk too much, you incompetent fool. `
`Then let me expand on my earlier move. `
`{p:1:The six definitely entered through {i:this front door}}!!" `
`"That's screwed up!! `
`The door was locked, it was impossible to unlock without using that single key, and yet six people entered through it?!?! `
`How?!! `
`With magic, you say?! `
`Damn it, dammit dammit dammit dammit dammit!!!" `
`"Wahahahahahahaaah!! `
`Are we already seeing the limits of what humanity can manage?" `
`"Then shout that you resign!! `
`When one admits defeat, it's customary to shout it out and knock over their own king. `
`So, do you resign?! `
`Then announce your surrender and knock your king over by kneeling!! `
`Then you may kiss my shoes! `
`There could be no greater joy than forcing a man like you to lick my shoes, *cackle*cackle*cackle*kakakakakakakaka!!" `
`......Damn iiiiiiiiit... `
`It's useless, useless, useless... `
`So I can't win against the witch...?! `
`This isn't chess at all, I've just been made to take the losing side in a chess puzzle...! `
`Is quibbling about details and getting a draw the best I can manage...? `
`"That's the one thing that'll never happen...! `
`Either I will surrender, or you will!! `
`There can be no other resolution!! `
`What happened to that bravery you displayed when you said this would be torture for us both?!" `
`"Hey, hey, hey, what a disappointment, what a total let doooooown, `
`wouldn't you say, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeer...????" `
`Damn iiiiiiiiiiiit, what should I do, what should I do?!! `
`I can see it, I can see the place where I'll face checkmate...!! `
`Aaaaaaaaah, it's useless it's useless, all my hard-fought moves have been nothing more than me desperately moving my king around, running away from check. `
`...No matter how many times I move, I can't escape from check. `
`So even without waiting for the next several moves, I can see checkmate in my future!! `
`Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit......!! `
`......After a few more moves, ...I can see where I'll face...checkmate...? `
`............ `
`...Don't give up, Ushiromiya Battler. `
`If I can see myself getting closed in upon... `
`...Then if I spin the chessboard around, ...I should be able to anticipate her next move, right...? `
`Remember what Kyrie-san said... `
`When you're thinking about something, then the closer you get to the very, very end, ...the easier it becomes to anticipate. `
`Spin it around. `
`...Spin the chessboard around...!! `
`".................." `
`"...What happened? `
`You fell silent all of a sudden. `
`Fear not. `
`Surrender is but a momentary shame. `
`After that, all that remains is the joy of entrusting your fate entirely to the hands of your new master... `
`...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!! `
`Come on, cry out in resignation. `
`......I can't hear you. `
`Speak up and say it clearly." `
`"......Enough babbling. `
`You're just refusing to listen. `
`...So I'll say it once more. `
`...I won't resign. `
`...Continue. `
`Resume the game." `
`"......Hoh. `
`Very well. `
`It is your turn, after all. `
`...*cackle*cackle*" `
`"I made the mistake of thinking this rule you made was your own weapon. `
`...However, I've realized that it can also become a weapon for me. `
`......It all comes down to this." `
`"Please do give it a try." `
`"I've been focusing all this time on how they entered the closed room of the chapel... `
`......That approach was useless. `
`...Aaah, it's useless, it's all useless. `
`...Spin the chessboard around." `
`"......That's right. `
`I was thinking about it backwards. `
`...This is how I should approach it. `
`......How was the chapel, which wasn't a closed room in the first place, made to look like a closed room?" `
`"Here it comes. `
`...That thinking technique humans gave birth to over the course of a century. `
`Give it a try, *cackle*cackle*!!" `
`"...Say this in red for me. `
`If you can't, then refuse. `
`...Here I go." `
`...Does this man...intend to reverse his defensive posture? `
`Impudence... `
`"I get that the only way to enter the chapel is through the door...and that there's only one key. `
`...But wait. `
`...The question is whether that key really was handed over to Maria yesterday before noon." `
`"......My, but you're dragging this on. `
`Do try and get to the point." `
`"It's something like this. `
`...We've been under the impression that the key's been unusable since midday yesterday. `
`So, we've assumed that this was a closed room from midday yesterday until this morning!" `
`"I want to hear you say that this impression of ours is a solid fact." `
`"Interesting. `
`...So you turn your reasoning not to the door, but to the key." `
`"Yesterday, Maria received an envelope from you. `
`She didn't open it, but she might've felt it and known there was key inside. `
`...But it's not like she'd have been able to confirm absolutely that it was the key to the chapel." `
`"......Here's what I'm getting at: `
`...the thing inside the envelope given to Maria was a fake." `
`"...If you think about what you're saying, it's ridiculous. `
`{p:1:This morning, Rosa definitely took an envelope out of Maria's handbag,} `
`{p:1:and from that obtained the genuine key to the chapel}. `
`...It wasn't a fake, as you suggest." `
`"Heheh... `
`I know that much. `
`I'll continue. `
`...In that case, when Maria first received the envelope, the thing inside it was definitely that same key to the chapel, right?" `
`"............ `
`......Hoh." `
`"See what I'm getting at? `
`...Midday yesterday, you gave Maria an envelope with a key inside. `
`And you told her that she mustn't open it. `
`......Maria probably realized it had a key inside." `
`"Later on, Aunt Rosa used the thing inside the envelope to open the door to the chapel, `
`{i:and that's why we assumed it was the key to the chapel all along}. `
`This is the suspicious part!" `
`".........So is this what you're trying to say? `
`That when I entrusted Maria with a key, that key was a fake? `
`And then, by the time Rosa obtained it, it had been switched with the real thing...?" `
`"Yeah, that's it. `
`...What's wrong, Beatrice-sama? `
`You've been looking a bit pale for a while now, huh...?" `
`"...Those close to me sometimes call me {ruby:bay-ah-tow:Beato}. `
`Beato will do." `
`"It's your turn, Beato. `
`The Turn of the Golden Witch! `
`...Let's see you dodge this." `
`"......Very well. `
`...{p:1:The key to the chapel truly was the object inside the envelope I gave Maria}." `
`"I'll move forward. `
`...Can you repeat it in red? `
`...'That envelope was completely under Maria's supervision until Aunt Rosa opened it'." `
`"............" `
`"...If you can't say it, then say you refuse. `
`Check." `
`"......Nng, .........I refuse." `
`"I've spun it all around with just one move. `
`...Now it's your king on the run, Beato." `
`"...Hmph, I have a reason for refusing. `
`It regards the definition of the phrase 'under her supervision'. `
`...In its purest meaning, Maria would need to have her eyes on it around the clock for that to be true." `
`"...But Maria didn't go that far. `
`It may have been completely under her supervision when she took it out of her handbag, but after she put it inside, it disappeared from her field of vision. `
`In that sense, the phrase 'under her supervision' would be inappropriate, so I couldn't use the red, nothing more. `
`............Nng..." `
`"...I'll bet that move hurt. `
`And your face tells me you've guessed the next one. `
`.........Sorry. `
`I'm kind to women. `
`I don't hurt them. `
`{i:And I never betray a woman's expectations}! `
`......It's time for you to repeat it in red, if you think you can. `
`'No one was able to touch Maria's handbag until Aunt Rosa took out the envelope'." `
`".........I will also...refuse this one. `
`...I won't explain the reason." `
`"That's wrong. `
`...It's not that you won't explain it, `
`it's that you can't explain it. `
`......That move gives us checkmate, doesn't it...?" `
`"............Nng..." `
`"If you can't do it, then I'll explain. `
`......The key to the chapel really was in the envelope you handed to Maria. `
`...Then Maria put it in her handbag, and the next morning, Aunt Rosa took it out and opened the lock." `
`"......However! `
`Maria didn't have the handbag under her complete supervision! `
`There's no need for magic. `
`It's a closed room trick that's possible for a human!" `
`"The Human culprit handed Maria the key, `
`and by making Aunt Rosa use it the next morning, they created the illusion that there was a closed room during that time." `
`"You can't deny the possibility that during that time, the culprit took the key from Maria's handbag, used it, `
`and returned it by morning!!" `
`"Can you say it in red?! `
`Repeat it! If you can say it, then say it!! `
`It's check again!!!" `
`"...N-Not yet. `
`I remove the check... `
`...The envelope with the key in it should have been sealed with wax...! `
`Rosa took it from an unopened envelope..." `
`"Really? Then try saying it!! `
`Repeat it!! `
`'The envelope handed over midday yesterday and one Aunt Rosa opened are the same thing'." `
`"Th-That I can repeat. `
`{p:1:The envelope I handed over to Maria and the one Rosa opened are the same thing}!!" `
`"...Hah...! `
`...Aaaaah, it's useless, it's all useless. `
`That doesn't even matter anymore. `
`...I expected more from you. `
`...I figured that if you were a bit better at reading between the lines, you'd resign right there. `
`...So I'm disappointed. `
`......{i:You've betrayed my expectations}." `
`"......Wh-Wha...aat......!!" `
`"Who cares if the envelopes were the same? `
`...Envelopes can be sealed with wax over and over! `
`The key inside is what's important." `
`"...Nngg, .........nnnnnnggg......" `
`"This time, it's all over, Golden Witch. `
`It's a real checkmate. `
`...I'll say it one more time, repeat it!! `
`If you can say it, try saying it!" `
`"'The key to the chapel inside the envelope Maria received wasn't used even once until Aunt Rosa opened the envelope'!!" `
`"..................h... `
`......Nnggg, `
`......how... `
`......! `
`How...... `
`c- `
`could I... `
`...Against a lowly human......!!" `
`"I'll keep on saying it, Beatrice!!! `
`Repeat it!! `
`'The key to the chapel inside the envelope Maria received wasn't used even once until Aunt Rosa opened the envelope'!!" `
`"...Nnngaaah, ...ooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhh!!!" `
`"If you're gonna yell, then say you resign! `
`This settles it!! `
`This is the truth." `
`"Before Aunt Rosa obtained Maria's key this morning, at one point, it passed to someone else's hands." `
`"Then they used it, resealed it, and returned it to Maria's handbag, making it look like it hadn't been used!" `
`"This is a trick with a cheap loophole, the assumption that the key wasn't used because the sealing wax wasn't opened!!" `
`"Checkmate!! `
`There's no magic, and it's nothing more than a trick that's possible for humans!!" `
`"I-In that case, ...who do you say stole the key?! `
`Try answering! `
`This time, you try repeating it...!!" `
`"That's right, I'm making you repeat things all the time. `
`I probably have to answer every once in a while..." `
`"{i:But I refuse}!! `
`My condition for victory is denying a witch's existence. `
`I'll prove that this impossible crime done with your magic was actually possible by human hands!!" `
`"I've smashed your closed room with something possible even for humans. `
`However, I won't specifically investigate who the culprit is." `
`"Because I believe in humans!! `
`Because I definitely won't accept that there's a person among us who would steal the key from Maria, use it, and do something so horrible!!" `
`"Heh, hehehehehhahahahahahahaha!!! `
`I give up, I resign! `
`Just once, for this skirmish, I'll give up. `
`...But, you really are naive, Battler." `
`"Parting remarks are a loser's privilege. `
`Say as many as you like." `
`"...Nngg...! `
`Since you continue to deny my existence, you will eventually be cornered..." `
`"After all, since you deny me, you will have to suspect those relatives that you can't stop loving...! `
`In the last moment, when you have to suspect one who is beloved to you, then you will surely accept my existence...!!" `
`"*cackle*cackle* True, you have defeated me in this skirmish alone. `
`...However, that naive logic will definitely destroy you... `
`...You can't win against me after all!! `
`Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!!" `
