`"Well then.`
` ...Did you enjoy it?`
` Our game just now."`
`"......A game that one‐sided goes beyond captivating and becomes boring."`
`"*cackle*cackle*. My, my, a harsh critic as always.`
` ......And I was so certain that even Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, who has no love for boredom,`
` would surely be satisfied by this compelling development... How remorseless."`
`"...Well, I'll accept that it was compelling.`
` ...However, it was horrible as a fair game.`
` You need the conditions to be a little more even, or—"`
`"......Am I about to be told there's no way to win?`
` By Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}?`
` ......*cackle*cackle*."`
`"..................I wonder what you mean by that, Beato."`
`"There's no need to play ignorant.`
` I already know.`
` ...That you {i:aren't a bystander}."`
`"................................."`
`"You thought you were hiding it?`
` How insolent, to travel all that way, and come into territory that isn't yours, just to bet against me.`
` You came here planning to watch my game from the sidelines, while having a large stake placed in my defeat.`
` I've guessed right, haven't I...?"`
`"...........................`
` And if so?"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*!`
` Truly interesting!"`
`"That I should be granted a chance to fight against Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, the strongest of witches who defeated Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, is truly a pleasure!!"`
`"......Yes.`
` It is pleasing me too.`
` After all, I came all this way just because I wanted to see you brimming with that confidence, only to fall apart and lose."`
`"What an honest person.`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"Incidentally, if the contest between me and the great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}...`
`were not to have at least one observer, what a tremendous shame that would be."`
`".................................`
` ...You called her, didn't you.`
` That child."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!`
` I found you, I finally found you, {f:5:Bernkastel}!!"`
`"............How are you, Lambda?`
` Looks like you also have time to kill.`
` ...I wonder if it's fate that we who share no love for boredom should run into each other again...?"`
`"Such a dumb kid.`
` Why can't you realize that the only reason you won against me was because of a little luck and a not‐so‐great matchup?`
` That made you so snobby, and now you're even picking a fight with {f:5:Beatrice}? Shouldn't you learn your place?"`
`"*giggle*, {f:5:Beatrice} is strong, you know.`
` And she's more brutal than I am.`
` Just a teensy bit!"`
`"Oh and also, don't just shorten someone's name to Lambda!"`
`".........You're a fool too, Beato.`
` This kid won't make exceptions for your game, she'll turn everything into a preposterous farce."`
`"I didn't bring Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} here solely to watch from the sidelines."`
`"After I informed her that you were betting against me, she said that she would bet against you."`
`"..............................You're still holding a grudge, aren't you."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!!`
` 'Cause I'm the strongest witch in the universe.`
` But I lost to you so I'm not the strongest!"`
`"So I'm taking the side of anyone who's against youuuu!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` There you have it.`
` With the great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} as our opponent, this may not even count as a handicap, but it will be suitable for entertainment."`
`"...............Do as you like.`
` ...Now that the cat's out of the bag, I'm going to get serious."`
`"That would be suitable.`
` "Leniency" has never featured in my dictionary.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, let us enjoy our valuable new relationship."`
`"Yes, I'll be counting on you, Lady {f:5:Beatrice}!`
` This girl really put me through the wringer.`
` I'm not gonna be happy until the two of us have smushed her up and paid her back double!!"`
`"............I look forward to it, Lambda.`
` And Beato.`
` ...No matter who wins or who loses, this will be a very meaningful battle for us."`
`"That's right.`
` Of course, I'm not gonna lose easy, but this is more important than winning and losing."`
`"After all, we have no love for boredom."`
`The three witches giggled, cackled, and guffawed.`
`"......That's right.`
` I should thank you, Beato.`
` It looks like I can finally escape boredom.`
` Do your best to entertain me.`
` Together with {f:5:Lambdadelta}."`
`"I shall do just that.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!!"`
`"That's that, Beato, so let's start a strategy meeting right now!`
` I know all of this girl's weak points, and I'm gonna teach you all of them!"`
`"And yet, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, you were defeated by her, I note... *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"Urrrrrrrrgggh, I won't tell you, I won't tell you!`
` Tsuun!"`
`"*cackle*cackle* hahhahahahahahaha!`
` ...She never bores, that Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}."`
`"............She doesn't, does she?`
` Take care of her.`
` She might not look it, but she gets lonely."`
`"I see.`
` So she's one of those newfangled whatchamacallits.`
` *cackle*, as expected from Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` Quite cutting edge.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`"Go already.`
` That child's waiting for you to chase after her."`
`"......Then, if you'll excuse me."`
`"See you next game.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`......I'm sorry.`
` A troublesome one came, but don't mind her.`
`More importantly,`
` .........things sure got ugly.`
`I thought I had experienced some particularly gruesome ends in my game with Lambda,`
` .........but this time, ......it's exceptionally horrible.`
`...It isn't as though I don't understand your desire to hug your knees and close your heart.`
`If you meet that end several more times,`
` your heart will be killed within a hundred years.`
`......Beato saw through me, so I'll confess.`
`You are now just like I was in the past, when I was imprisoned inside Lambda's world.`
`Shut inside a labyrinth of cruel fate, tormented at the whims of a witch.`
`...I am a witch who was born from there.`
`......So maybe I'm like an older sister to you.`
` So I decided that I'd lend you my power.`
`However,`
` ............even compared to my fate,`
` ......yours is...truly brutal.`
`Not only do I sympathize with you, I'm almost brought to tears by your tragic fate.`
`But please, don't lose heart.`
`Please don't submit to Beato, no matter what.`
`Certainly, that child's game is quite unfair.`
`I took a glimpse of the game board, and the tricks are so mean and cunning,`
` and the scenic tricks are filthy to a degree that probably far surpasses that of {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s game board.`
`And what's even more frightening is that when that child moves a piece, it's not like she always makes the best possible move.`
`This is where she is very different from Lambda.`
`Lambda always uses an overpowering number of pieces and makes the best possible move, in order to win.`
`But Beato sometimes intentionally eases up when she moves her pieces.`
`This is unfortunate for us, trying to seek out our opponent's strategy by looking at her moves,`
` because it creates a formidable amount of noise in our information.`
`This disorder could be troublesome.`
`......However, as in chess,`
` a player might be able to create some noise for their opponent with a useless move, but they would still miss out on a more valuable move.`
`In other words, it's not like your opportunities to take advantage of it are zero.`
`Although you may not be able to believe it, this game was also like that.`
`......Even though those developments looked so overpowering,`
` ...there actually were weak points.`
`It looks almost as if she wants us to take advantage of them.`
`......Although, I don't know if it's a trap or if she's testing us.`
`Anyway, don't surrender.`
`Don't stop thinking.`
`Don't deny any possibility.`
`As long as you continue to hold the will to fight, Beato will not win.`
`Defense is crucial during a witch's battle, you know?`
`Rather than trying to win, try not to lose.`
`...If you lose when you accept her, then you definitely must not accept her.`
`......Making you accept witches.`
`There is no longer any doubt that this is one of {f:5:Beatrice}'s victory conditions.`
`Now that I have announced that I am your ally, I too will make an effort to lend you as much of my power as I can.`
`Make an effort yourself as well.`
`If you're still hugging your knees, quickly stand back up.`
`......Umm, in times like this, what did I use to say again?`
`.........Umm, uh,`
` .........Fi‐`
`...fight,`
` yea~h.`
` Mii,`
` nipah~{p:0:☆}`
`..................It's so embarrassing, doing this.`
`......I've done this much for you, so hurry and stand back up.`
`"...Ah, there you are.`
` Did Bern shrink off somewhere?`
` *giggle*, could she be any more lame?"`
`Anywho.`
`The pieces Bern chooses are crummy as usual, huh.`
`It's the same with chess, right?`
`If all your pieces were pawns, you'd have zero chance to win, right?`
`If all your pieces were rooks and bishops, no way you'd lose.`
`......W‐well, last time, I felt just a little pity and said that she could start her pieces anywhere she wants,`
` and then that idiot Bern totally didn't pick up on my compassion and started with aaall of her pawns promoted on the eighth rank!!`
`What's up with that, that wasn't a loss or anything!!`
` Aaah, just remembering that makes me queasy.`
`So, see, I'm gonna be ruffled until I see Bern's stupid speechless face.`
`So it's like, seeing you in this state as Bern's piece, that makes me feel just awesome!`
`Plus, believe it or not, that girl really hates to lose,`
` so I bet she's definitely grinding her teeth in frustration right about now, crying like a baby,`
` she's so lame, *giggle*, hohhh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!`
`C'mon, laugh with me, oh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!`
`............Wait a sec.`
`Are you still hugging your knees?`
`You're already like this just because Beato got a little serious?`
`Could you be any more pathetic?`
`You're so pathetic, I'll help you just a little bit.`
`I, the great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, the Witch of Certainty and the strongest in the universe,`
` will bring your hopeless chances of winning just a teensy bit closer to certainty.`
` You better thank me.`
`You know, {f:5:Beatrice} may really be a cruel and powerful witch, but she's no match for me.`
`Why?`
` 'Cause she's soft.`
`That kid will make the board so she can win with just a few more moves, but she deliberately won't finish you off.`
`She'll do stuff like take worthless pieces, or put way too many pieces on the board to make things even more one‐sided.`
`The point is, she's got this bad habit of playing around when she thinks she's going to win.`
`Almost all the various attacks that are painful for you and Bern...`
`look like a total waste and overkill to me.`
`...Basically, that's her weakness, and it's also your chance.`
` See?`
` She isn't an opponent to be afraid of, right?`
`She sometimes mistakes the means for the end.`
`And she has too much bad fun.`
`As a result, she makes and even exposes her own weak points.`
`It's impossible for a strongest‐ever witch like me to understand why she acts so relaxed.`
`Lowering her own chances of winning.`
`.........But, well.`
`That's why the type of witch like Bern who reads her opponent and dodges their moves has a really bad matchup with her.`
` 'Cause reading her doesn't work.`
`...It's probably really easy for Bern to read and handle an obedient and honest type like me.`
` That makes me so mad!`
`...Well, still, a super‐firepower type like me can easily go head‐on against a light, wide‐range barrage type like {f:5:Beatrice},`
` so I guess it's kinda like rock‐paper‐scissors.`
`If I'm paper, Beato's rock.`
`I guess Bern would be scissors.`
`Weeelll, maybe none of that matters anyway.`
`Sure, my paper loses to Bern's scissors,`
` but if it was the way more awesome super‐paper, which is as thick as wood, it could even beat scissors, right?!`
`In other words, I, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta},`
` am super‐paper, and super‐thick!`
` Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!`
`It looks like the color's come back to your face a little.`
`That Beato, she's having fun torturing some piece called Rosa.`
`At a glance, you'd think she has really nasty hobbies, right?`
` Wrong, though!`
`......She's just killing time, hoping you'll get up and come back.`
`It's a move to fire up your righteous indignation by doing something to make you hate her on purpose.`
`Ah man, I hate kids like that!`
`Well then, I'll go back.`
`Ah!`
` Don't you tell anyone that I helped you out just a teensy bit!`
`I mean, it's not like I helped you because I wanted to save you, okay?!`
`I, the strongest witch in the universe, had my seat as the strongest stolen when I lost to Bern!`
`So it's like, I have to take that seat back from Bern,`
` but if Bern loses to Beato here, then the position of the strongest will be moved to Beato this time, right?!`
`...Well, it'd be easier to steal it back from Beato, so who cares really, but that won't satisfy me, you know what I mean?!`
`I'm gonna be the one to defeat Bern!`
`And I'll take back my position as the strongest!`
`It's not like I'm really helping you, okay?!`
`I won't forgive you if you make Bern cry!`
