`"...Maria hasn't come back.`
` ......I wonder if she's being scolded by Auntie Rosa again."`
`Ever since they had met Maria in the airport, she had constantly been making a huge fuss about Halloween.`
`...But it seemed she had cut loose a little too much,`
` and acted a little too boisterous on the plane, on the boat, and during lunch, because Rosa had warned her several times.`
`In times like that, Auntie Rosa would rarely scold her in front of people.`
`{n}...More commonly, she would call Maria into the shadows, and scold her when they were alone.`
`So since Maria had been called off somewhere, they thought she must be getting scolded.`
`When they looked at the clock, they realized that it was almost six.`
`{n}They couldn't really imagine that Maria had been being scolded this whole time.`
`Perhaps it had come time for some anime she watched every week to start, or something.`
` She had probably just decided to stay in the mansion's parlor.`
`"It could be that Battler‐sama has woken up and they are playing together."`
`"Well, Maria‐chan must have thought of Battler‐kun as sort of a new friend.`
` ...I'm sure she had tons of fun when she played Halloween with Battler‐kun at the airport."`
`"Battler was messing around a lot himself.`
` That dude's gotten big, but he hasn't changed a bit on the inside from how he used to be."`
`"That's true.`
` ...I get the feeling that Battler‐sama was gracious enough to remain as he was six years ago."`
`"Shannon, you remember how Battler‐kun was six years ago?"`
`"Yes.`
` Because he was, well, very energetic.`
` *giggle*."`
`"I also remember how the four of us used to play six years ago.`
` Shannon acted a lot like a big sister."`
`"Yeah.`
` I get the feeling she was more level‐headed back then.`
` Ahahahaha!"`
`"Ba‐...back then I, umm, ......didn't know my place, so...`
` Umm, I must apologize for all my poor conduct..."`
`"......There's no need for all those professional manners.`
` Your work aside, when you're taking your break like you are now, I'd like it if we could all be friendly together like we were back then."`
`"Yeah, totally.`
` ...There's no reason why you can't separate the servant Shannon from the off‐duty Sayo.`
` ......You aren't a slave, you're just working a job as a servant, right?"`
`".........I think of you, Shannon,`
` ...no, Sayo, as my oldest friend."`
`"............Thank you very much, Milady."`
`It seemed that Shannon understood what lurked under Jessica's words.`
`{n}......Because she had heard a little bit from Jessica and Kanon about what had happened between them.`
`".................."`
`Apparently, George had also been informed about that, more or less.`
`George approached the window, and looked up at the darkening rainy sky...`
`"...Kanon‐kun is still young, and I think in some ways he tries a little too hard to be mature in his way of thinking."`
`"Uhh, hahahaha...`
` C'mon, quit it already."`
`"Well, umm, it's my fault too, I think part of it was I got sucked in by the atmosphere...`
` And, umm, ...maybe after looking at you two, umm, I got a little jealous, and started feeling a little rushed, there might have been a bit of that, too..."`
`"......Who, who cares about me, anyway?`
` More importantly, how's it going between you two?`
` Looks like it's going pretty good, eh?`
` Eheheh!"`
`"Err, ......I, ...I wonder..."`
`"Yes.`
` It's going very well."`
`Shannon was lost for words, her face red, while George answered brightly and immediately.`
`{n}That carefree attitude made it obvious that their relationship was proceeding so perfectly it would make anyone envious.`
`"Tch, I'm jealous.`
` ......Does that mean Shannon's gonna be resigning and cutting up a cake pretty soon?"`
`"I, I wonder...`
` I don't, umm......"`
`"I wonder, right?`
` How could I know?"`
`George laughed like he was being mean and drew closer to Shannon.`
`{n}...It was probably the way they usually flirted when they were alone.`
`{n}Jessica could only smile awkwardly and say "yes, yes, thank you, that's enough".`
`"I have a dream.`
` It isn't only my ambition to become the leader of my own domain in business.`
` I also have a dream to build a family together with a partner I can spend my life with."`
`"...I want two kids at the very least.`
` And I'd like to do some sports that the whole family could do together.`
` And many more things besides that.`
` I often talk with Shannon about that kind of thing.`
` .........Although every time I talk about that sort of thing, Shannon always laughs and says I'm getting ahead of myself."`
`"...For some reason, even at the age I am now, I already find myself thinking about my retirement and settling down.`
` ......With my healthy grown kids, and grandchildren running around.`
` About how nice it will be to spend my final years at a slow pace, surrounded by that, and together with Shannon forever."`
`"You're definitely getting ahead of yourself.`
` ......But, how should I say it, it sounds like you, George nii‐san."`
`"Being surrounded by a family like that would probably be so wonderful.`
` ......The ideal family that I painted in my mind when I was younger was something like that."`
`...To Shannon, who had been raised in a welfare institute, that harmonious image of a family was probably something she yearned after.`
`......And George, who promised that he would definitely grant that wish for her, was surely a fitting person for her to spend her life with...`
`Shannon was an important friend to Jessica.`
` ......George was surely the one most fit to entrust that friend's future to.`
`"Well, I don't want to throw cold water on you guys,`
` ......but Uncle Hideyoshi aside, what's gonna happen with Auntie Eva?`
` Won't it be tough to convince her?"`
`"........................"`
`"Ahahahaha.`
` There's no reason for anyone to worry about something like that.`
` ......No one can influence my choice of partner.`
` I will make Shannon happy.`
` Whose permission do I need?"`
`"......Whooooa.`
` George nii‐san, that was cool...`
` I can't believe you can say something so embarrassing out loud.`
` I thought you didn't use to be that kind of character."`
`"Leave a boy for three days and you'll hardly recognize him, after all.`
` ......Even I grow up.`
` ...I plan to study more and more, to grow to be a suitable man who can make Shannon happy."`
`It seemed that perhaps George had some kind of awareness of how embarrassing the words coming out of his mouth were.`
` His face turned very slightly red, and he scratched his head.`
`"............George‐san."`
`"It's alright.`
` I'm sure Mother will be difficult, but you can leave that to me.`
` I'll show you that I can make the whole family accept you as my partner."`
`"Awesome...`
` I'm jealous of you Shannon, seriously!"`
`"......I‐if you will go so far,`
` .........then I'm, I'm very grateful..."`
`"Wait a sec, ...I'm starting to feel like a third wheel here.`
` Maybe it's better I leeeeave?"`
`Smiling awkwardly, Jessica stood up from the bed she had been sitting on,`
` and at that very moment, the phone rang.`
`Before Jessica picked up the receiver, wondering what they wanted, Shannon looked at the clock and was taken aback.`
` ......It seemed that she had taken too long on her break.`
`"I, I am sorry...!`
` I forgot it was time for work...!`
` I‐if you will excuse me...!"`
`At the same time that Jessica picked up the phone, Shannon began dashing out of the room.`
`"Ah, Shannon!`
` .........Again, same time, same place."`
`"Ye‐.........yes.`
` ...Ex‐excuse me!"`
`"Hello, it's Jessica.`
` .........Ah, Genji‐san.`
` Yes, Shannon is heading your way as we speak.`
` We held her up, I'm afraid.`
` Please don't scold her.`
` Yes, okay."`
`"I see.`
` So it will be time for dinner to be prepared soon."`
`Many plates were lined up on the counter in the kitchen, and preparations for dinner were proceeding steadily.`
`......The number of plates that were lined up there...`
`......was 19.`
`{n}That number was one more than were lined up during the family conference every year.`
`"I can't accept it...!`
` Why can't I deliver it directly?!"`
`Gohda‐san was flaring up at Genji, paying no heed to the pot that was boiling over.`
`The Master enjoys having his food alone in his study, so the food must be set out in the study.`
` Of course, this is nothing new, you understand.`
`Gohda‐san would really like to set the table for the Master with his own hands, as he puts his heart and soul into his cooking.`
`......But the Master had imposed a strict rule that none but the servants bearing the crest of the Golden Eagle could enter his study.`
`.........So while Gohda‐san could greet the Master from outside the study,`
` not once had he been granted the honor of carrying his cooking into the study.`
`Gohda‐san was always unsatisfied with this.`
`{n}...Of course he knows he is a newcomer in terms of years of service.`
`However, he has accumulated plenty of experience from his previous jobs, and he is strongly confident that he would be able to conduct himself properly, even in front of Kinzo, in a way that would not insult him.`
`And yet, just because he is not permitted the Golden Eagle, he still hasn't been blessed with this honor.`
`......You can probably imagine what damage that has done to his pride.`
` You might think that tonight is a mere resurgence of that old argument, but it isn't.`
`Because tonight, there is a person other than the Master who wants their food carried to their room.`
`Apparently, this person is a very rare and honored guest, and there has been a strict order to treat this person in the same manner as the Master, the family head.`
`Gohda‐san must have wanted to earn some points by serving this honored guest with his own hands.`
`Because he is a person of strong vanity.`
` If he isn't qualified to serve the Master, then at least a guest of the same rank...`
`He simply couldn't make time during lunch, so Kanon‐san had gone for him.`
` ...Therefore, he truly desired to serve tonight's food personally—the best dinner of the year.`
`But Genji‐san had had a problem with that.`
`......Something about how Gohda‐san didn't have the One‐winged Eagle.`
`.........After being once again scolded that he wasn't qualified, Gohda‐san had lost his patience.`
`Ahh, how heartrending, Gohda‐san...`
`I cannot do anything more than watch like this from the shadows...`
`"Kumasawa‐san, if you have enough free time to dawdle around, please prepare the dining hall.`
` Is the tablecloth ready?!"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho... Oh my, my apologies..."`
`When it became her turn to bear the brunt, Kumasawa softly disappeared into the hall.`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is of exactly the same rank as the Master.`
` ......We must respect the same rules that we respect for the Master."`
`"......Gohda, you will devote your attention entirely towards the task you have been given, and attend to the family..."`
`"I don't mind if it's you, Genji‐san, but is it really alright to let a child like this go to such a guest?!`
` If she made some blunder, it would be quite rude."`
`"I know that they have served here for a long time, but it's not as though they have undergone a proper apprenticeship.`
` If you will allow me to speak freely, they do not have the proper grounding to entertain guests!"`
`"........................"`
`Gohda spoke bluntly, even though Shannon was waiting right there in the kitchen.`
`Shannon was the one who Genji had ordered to carry the food to {f:5:Beatrice}'s room.`
` ......By the ranking system among the servants permitted the Golden Eagle, Shannon was indeed the second highest ranked.`
`...If the highest ranked, Genji, went to set the table in Kinzo's room, then it fell to Shannon to set the table in {f:5:Beatrice}'s room.`
`Gohda's pride was always horribly injured when he was confronted with this ranking system.`
` ...In times like that, he would speak out bluntly and rudely about Shannon and Kanon.`
`Gohda kept raising example after example of Shannon's past failures, making a ruckus about how this was wrong and that was wrong.`
`As Shannon listened to this with her head hung in shame, she heard Kanon's voice from behind her.`
`...Kanon had been listening from a blind spot, leaning against the hallway side of the wall near the entrance to the kitchen.`
` ...He probably knew that if he entered the kitchen, sparks would start to fly his way.`
`"............Let him rant.`
` He's a horrible man."`
`"......B‐but, this helps me to build up a grounding on how to entertain someone.`
` ......Gohda‐san has learned a lot, so what he has to say is very..."`
`"Hmph.`
` ......Nee‐san, you sure are nice."`
`"......More importantly,`
` ............is the guest in the VIP room...`
`really {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, as they say?"`
`"...Yes.`
` .........I met her when I was sent to set the table for her during lunch.`
` ...There's no mistake—it's her."`
`"Re‐really?`
` Was she doing well?"`
`"........................"`
`Kanon remembered that he and Shannon had different impressions of {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` To Shannon, {f:5:Beatrice} was a cupid of love, who had granted her magic to create her relationship with George.`
`Judging by her happy expression,`
` ...it looked like she couldn't wait to inform {f:5:Beatrice} of how her relationship with George had progressed.`
`......However, Kanon already knew.`
`{n}That witch had come here with a terrifying goal in mind.`
`......That vague witch, in the past only visible to them, had now walked in openly through the front door,`
` and had revived enough that they could now carry food to her.`
`...In the past, when she had disappeared from in front of Kanon...`
`{n}...the witch had said something about how her own power was still weak.`
`.........Now that the witch could appear openly like this, did that mean that she had finally returned to her former power?`
`And she had said.`
` .........She had said clearly that she had sown the seeds of love with the knowledge that it would fail.`
`She had said also.`
` .........She had said clearly that the day had finally come when the door to the Golden Land would be opened.`
`".........Shannon.`
` ...She will perform some bizarre ritual with the Master, ...and will surely do something unimaginably horrible.`
` ......And no one can resist that."`
`"What are you talking about......?"`
`"She came here...`
`as the Master requested, so that the door to the Golden Land would open, and so that everything would be returned to the Golden Land.`
` She said that to me clearly!"`
`"................................."`
`In the past,`
` ......the two of them, as furniture working for Kinzo, had been told what the opening of the door to the Golden Land meant.`
`Therefore, even without asking a single question in response, Shannon understood everything.`
`{n}.........So, ...she grew deeply hopeless.`
`...Something tore at Kanon's heart as he saw her expression twist with grief...`
`"............How could...`
` .........Why, ...why now............"`
`"......Didn't I tell you?`
` We are furniture!`
` ......Because you acted like a human, because you loved, .........you can't obediently accept the day when our service is over...!"`
`"..................At one time, I used to wish that this day would come.`
` ......But it never came after so much time...`
` ......I didn't know how long we would have to be tormented as furniture...`
` .........So I thought.`
` ...I thought that day of rest wouldn't come for all eternity."`
`".........I thought that too!`
` But I believed that it would definitely come someday!`
` So I never forgot that I am furniture!`
` But Nee‐san, you forgot that!"`
`"..................It's......my fault, isn't it......`
` .........Mine......"`
`"Yeah, it's your fault, Nee‐san.`
` ......If only you hadn't known love...`
` ......We would both be happy that this day has finally come!`
` You built up meaningless attachments!`
` Even though it was a world that you would definitely have to leave!!"`
`"...............Will the ritual...begin tonight...?"`
`"...Yes.`
` ...............Also, she said this to me.`
` ...Tonight, George‐sama will probably give you an engagement ring, Nee‐san."`
`"........................"`
`That was a fact.`
` ......George should have snuck in an engagement ring in his pocket today.`
` ......And surely, he would hand it over tonight.`
`"......She joined you together, planning to use you and George‐sama as the sacrifices for the second twilight.`
` ...Understand?`
` Nee‐san, she took advantage of you by tempting you!"`
`"............So that was it.`
` ......I never thought of that."`
`"But she told me.`
` ...She promised that if you don't accept the engagement ring tonight, she won't choose you as a sacrifice.`
` ............I think that our chances of being able to go to the Golden Land together are very slim."`
`"There will be thirteen people sacrificed.`
` Only five will be left alive.`
` ...The chances of us both being a part of that group are really slim.`
` ......However, if you at least can take advantage of that promise, those chances rise higher!`
` I want to take that bet!"`
`"Our salvation is in the Golden Land.`
` If we can make it that far, we can become human.`
` And I want to walk through life as a human, together with you, Nee‐san...!`
` If we do that, we might even be able to achieve...`
`...true love!"`
`"..............................`
` ...We used to dream about being able to go to the Golden Land, didn't we?`
` .........If we go there, any wish will be granted.`
` .........We will be saved from this pain.`
` ............We believed that."`
`However, in this ritual, only a few people, chosen by fate and chance, would be invited to the Golden Land.`
` ......Everyone else would lose their life as a sacrifice midway through the ceremony.`
`But in the past, Shannon and Kanon had thought...`
`that whether they reached the Golden Land or were made sacrifices, it would be all the same, because they would be released from their duties as furniture either way.`
`......So, in short, the ritual had been something that would definitely grant release to furniture like them.`
`"I don't like it.`
` ......Together with you, I want to take back all the hard times we had.`
` I won't become a sacrifice.`
` You and I will remain alive.`
` And we'll reach the Golden Land together."`
`"............So I won't let you become the sacrifice for the second twilight!`
` Please, Nee‐san!`
` Don't accept that man's ring!`
` If you don't accept it, she promised not to select you as a sacrifice!!"`
`".....................That's......something I can't do.`
` ......Tonight's ring is very special.`
` ......My heart...won't permit me to not accept it."`
`"Nee‐san...!`
` The witch decides the ritual sacrifices arbitrarily!`
` That witch has promised to overlook you at least, Nee‐san!!`
` You at least will definitely be able to go to the Golden Land!"`
`"......Me at least?`
` What about you, Kanon‐kun?"`
`"The witch's game......is enough for me.`
` ...I'll slip through her evil hand.`
` .........I am not powerless.`
` I'll grab that small chance and I won't let go..."`
`"............................................."`
`"After all, our lives are temporary, aren't they?`
` ...In order to begin our real lives,`
` ......let's make it to the Golden Land.`
` And...`
`let's gain our humanity."`
`"...............And then...`
`...maybe, like you, Nee‐san,`
` ......I'll be able to know love.`
` Maybe I won't have to call myself furniture,`
` .........and make people cry anymore......"`
`".........Kanon‐kun............"`
`"I...`
`...don't want to be furniture anymore......!`
` ......I'm gonna...`
`...become human......`
` ...No more pain,`
` ......I'm gonna end it all.........!"`
`"............................................."`
`There were tears in Kanon's eyes...`
`It had taken Kanon until now to notice.`
`{n}......Shannon hadn't been the only one to know and suffer the taste of love.`
`He had too.`
`The tears Jessica had shown him that day,`
` ......and her painful smiles on all the days since as she tried to smooth things over and brighten her mood...`
`had slowly wrought some kind of change on Kanon's heart without him knowing it...`
`".........Shannon!`
` I have been calling you for ages."`
`Shannon snapped to reality at the sudden sound of Genji's voice.`
`{n}Apparently, she had been called for repeatedly.`
`{n}She hurriedly answered.`
`......When she turned around, Kanon had disappeared.`
`{n}......It seemed he didn't feel like showing his tears to anybody...`
`"Ye‐yes.`
` I'm sorry for being distracted..."`
`"I had Kanon handle lunch, but properly speaking, as the next in rank after me, you should have been the one to take it to her.`
` .........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is the most honored guest of this house.`
` There is no more honored guest than her.`
` ......Please think of her as another master of the mansion and be polite."`
`"...I must impress upon you once again—please be very careful not to make any blunders.`
` It is quite painful for me to entrust this to someone inexperienced as yourself, but there's nothing we can do about the house's rules.`
` ......I am sincerely counting on you."`
`Gohda had officially agreed, but he threatened Shannon with an expression that told her that he definitely wouldn't forgive any mistakes.`
`Shannon, too, thought that Gohda should do it if he wanted to that much,`
` ......but considering it as her responsibility as one who had been granted the Golden Eagle, she had to give up.`
`......Besides.`
` ...I wanted to meet {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}What will I talk about?`
` What will I ask?`
` ...I don't know.`
`Will I show gratitude?`
` Or else, grief?`
`{n}Or else, ...what?`
` ...I don't know.`
`Shannon loaded the witch's food onto the serving cart, and left the kitchen with a slow gait...`
`The person knocking was Krauss.`
`"Father.`
` Today is our annual family conference.`
` Haven't the siblings gathered here to get a glance of you, Father?"`
`"Aaah, be silent!!`
` I have told you I won't leave!`
` I imagine that you are there, Genji!!`
` Why haven't you had my food brought here as I ordered you to?!!"`
`Kinzo screamed through the door.`
`{n}...Genji was waiting behind Krauss.`
`"......Your meal has been prepared so that it may be carried to the study.`
` ...However, Krauss‐sama wishes for you to go downstairs tonight..."`
`"Father.`
` I don't mean every day.`
` Even if it's just for tonight, won't you gather together with your family?"`
`"Who are you calling family!!`
` When did you start calling those vultures who wait for me to collapse and die family?!`
` When did you start calling rotting, gushing maggots FAMILY?!!"`
`"...........................`
` ...My, my."`
`Krauss shrugged at this answer which he had half‐expected.`
`"Genji, carry the meal here as you were told!!`
` Why don't you listen to what I say?!!`
` Why?!`
` WHY?!!"`
`"......Genji‐san.`
` I will leave the rest to you.`
` ...My voice will no longer reach him."`
`Krauss gave his head a small shake, and quickly turned his back on the door to the study.`
`......He had only called out for his siblings' sake, knowing it was useless.`
`After Genji watched Krauss go down the stairs, he called again through the door.`
`"...My lord.`
` We have finished preparations for the meal to be carried here.`
` .........What about the serving for Doctor Nanjo?"`
`Nanjo was also in the study.`
` Because Kinzo had strongly pestered him about resolving their long‐lasting chess game, Nanjo had been Kinzo's opponent since before evening.`
`Nanjo had announced as a doctor that Kinzo's days were numbered.`
`{n}...In that situation, if Kinzo pestered him about finishing a chess game while he was still alive, Nanjo couldn't refuse.`
`Kinzo was thinking deeply about his move, concentrating more than usual.`
` ......It had been Kinzo's turn for quite some time, and Nanjo, who was tired of waiting, had started randomly pulling out grimoires that he couldn't understand and skimming through them.`
`".........Kinzo‐san.`
` You won't think of a good move just by folding your arms and sitting in front of the board.`
` I wonder if it wouldn't be good to take a break and refresh our minds...?"`
`"Be silent.`
` ......Hmmm.`
` ......That should be good enough for defense.`
` Will that hole be penetrated by the bishop or the knight...?`
` ............nnnnnnnn..."`
`Today, Kinzo was insistent on a strong defense.`
`......Normally, Kinzo's motto was that offense was the best defense.`
` However, today was completely the opposite.`
`"............I am also hungry.`
` Shall we suspend the game here?`
` And I've used my head so much without a break that I'm already feeling dizzy.`
` ......Any more of this might limit my ability to make my best moves."`
`"...That is a problem.`
` ............In chess, both players must always make their best moves.`
` ...Other moves are painful to understand, and ruin a game that is about reading thoughts.`
` ...That considerably reduces our enjoyment."`
`Kinzo sighed deeply, and finally shifted his gaze away from the board.`
`Chess needs an opponent.`
` ...That opponent was tired and suggesting to suspend the game, so what else could be done...`
`"It is true that the goal of chess is for both players to aim for victory and make the best moves possible in order to achieve that.`
` ...It is an intellectual game of being able to read each other."`
`"......But Kinzo‐san, are you forgetting that there is another goal separate from victory?"`
`"............What?`
` What goal could there be other than victory?"`
`"Hahahaha......`
` It surprises me you would forget even that.`
` ...Through chess, you get to spend some fun time with your friend,`
` you see."`
`"Ah,`
` ......you got me.`
` I believe those are words I said to you a long time ago.`
` ............I shall have to concede that."`
`Kinzo, who normally wore a frown, surprisingly relaxed his face and laughed.`
` ...Nanjo felt like he had been reunited with a close friend he hadn't seen in a long time.`
`"That's how it is.`
` Now that I've taken a shot back at you, what do you think?`
` Will you go down to eat with me?`
` What do you say about discussing Kasparov's middlegame over some coffee?"`
`".................................`
` ...A good plan, but I will refrain.`
` ......I can no longer leave this room.`
` ...Because the ritual has begun."`
`"............Is that so?`
` Well, my stomach is growling.`
` ...I will go downstairs.`
` Any time you feel like it—"`
`"Nanjo.`
` ............Thank you."`
`"......Oh, what could you be thanking me for?"`
`"...We didn't resolve our chess match.`
` ......However, it seems that I have succeeded in that goal of chess which I forgot.`
` It seems that was just as important as checkmate."`
`"This isn't like you.`
` Why so sentimental?"`
`".........You said it, didn't you?`
` My days are numbered.`
` ......Now, go.`
` And don't come to this room again.`
` ......We shall continue in the Golden Land."`
`"..............................`
` ...That is fine, but it shall be a rematch.`
` Losing that rook was a serious blow."`
`"......Well then, I will see you later."`
`"Yes, later.`
` ............Maybe in the Golden Land, or in Purgatory.`
` Or in the next world."`
`"..........................."`
`Nanjo didn't say anything beyond that.`
` And with a practiced hand, he pushed the button on the table that would release the auto‐lock.`
`Then, after looking at Kinzo's back one last time, he left the study.`
`As he did, Genji's voice came from the hall.`
`"......Well then, my lord.`
` I will now carry in your dinner."`
`"It may be my last supper.`
` I must savor it.`
` ......Please, get it ready."`
`"Certainly.`
` ............Are your own preparations in order, my lord?"`
`"...Indeed.`
` I have spent my time until today wrapping this room in a multitude of rigorous barriers.`
` .........Even if that roulette chooses me, I will definitely repel it.`
` ...I will remain alive, and I will definitely become one of those who reach the Golden Land...!`
` ......I will reject the visitations of the gods of death who try to drag me off to Hades..."`
`".........Excuse me.`
` ...I have come to prepare your meal."`
`Shannon entered the VIP room, bowing her head and pushing the serving cart.`
`The young woman by the window, apparently gazing out into the impenetrable darkness outside, was unmistakably that witch.`
`"So it is Shannon this time.`
` How nostalgic.`
` .........Hoh.`
` Your countenance has improved quite considerably, has it not?`
` Unlike Kanon.`
` Almost beyond recognition."`
`".........Thank you very much."`
`Shannon solemnly prepared dinner.`
`...There were actually several things that she wanted to ask and talk with the witch about.`
` ...But those things were all jumbled up, and she didn't know where to start.`
`Her heart was also jumbled up with various things, and she didn't even understand her own emotions.`
` ...Therefore, still remaining vague, all she could do was to carry out her work indifferently.`
`However, the witch guessed what was in her heart.`
`{n}You can't hide things from a witch...`
`"...............I won't apologize.`
` Because I am a witch."`
`"......For what?"`
`"Come.`
` ...Kanon must have told you about it.`
` Helping out your love life was simply my mischievous spirit.`
` ......It was nothing more than a seed I sowed in order to enjoy witnessing in what manner things would get complicated, become twisted, and fail."`
`".........There are some who think it is more fun to hear about love than to have it."`
`"Surely, .........you aren't trying to thank me?"`
`"...Yes, I am.`
` ......No matter what kind of ulterior motive you had when you gave me the magic of love,`
` ......it doesn't change the fact that you gave it to me."`
`".........So even if you sowed that seed knowing that the two of us wouldn't be able to stay together for life,`
` ...I won't hold a grudge against you."`
`"............Hmmmm.`
` ......Furniture truly is uninteresting.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` Cooking it into something interesting is where my skill shines."`
`"......I don't understand how you think, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` ......You are a Great Witch, and people like us don't even reach your feet,`
` ...nor can we even imagine your grand thoughts.`
` But there is at least one thing I can say."`
`"......What is it?"`
`"Thank you for teaching me to be human.`
` .........You said it yourself.`
` ...I am no longer furniture."`
`"...............Silence, furniture.`
` ...If you were a true human, hearing the announcement of your death on the day that you were to receive an engagement ring should have you dancing around mad with grief."`
`"But what of you?`
` Your face looks enlightened, as though you have accepted everything!`
` ......Truly an anticlimax. Furniture...!"`
`"No.`
` I am not furniture."`
`"Silence, furniture."`
`"I won't be silent.`
` Because I am not furniture."`
`"Are you saying you won't listen to my orders?"`
`"Furniture obeys orders.`
` ...But a human decides for herself whether to obey orders or not.`
` {i:So I won't obey your orders.}"`
`"Hmph.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle* hahahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!`
` ......I'll take back what I said.`
` You really are interesting."`
`"......If I hadn't sowed those seeds, you probably would have allowed the ritual to control your fate without any emotion at all.`
` ......But now you have grown to be truly interesting, and you entertain me from the bottom of my heart.`
` That is fine.`
` Because I have no love for boredom.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`".........I have finished preparations for dinner.`
` ...Here you go."`
`"Hmm.`
` ...Doesn't this look delicious.`
` .........If Gohda makes it to the Golden Land, it may be desirable to commission him as my chief cook."`
`"......I heard from Kanon‐kun.`
` .........Something about, if I rejected George‐san's proposal, you promised not to make me a sacrifice."`
`"Mm.`
` I did.`
` ......Although you were an ideal sacrifice for the second twilight.`
` ...Kanon cried and screamed that I should pardon you of that, so I graciously listened to his words.`
` With the condition that you give up your engagement.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*, how gracious I am."`
`"............What a foolish condition.`
` And what a foolish threat.`
` ......You bullied Kanon‐kun thoroughly using that, I suppose?"`
`"Hoh.`
` So you can tell.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`Apparently, Shannon had seen through it.`
` ......Apparently, she could imagine how much Kanon had been bullied and humiliated by the witch, with that horrible promise as bait.`
`"I made him crawl on the carpet and kiss my shoes.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` And that's not all.`
` ......Do you want to hear the other ways in which I humiliated him...?"`
`Shannon silently shook her head.`
`"I have finally come to understand you.`
` You like to bully, confuse, and trouble people, and you do it to entertain yourself.`
` .........So I'm now sure that this is the only way to resist you."`
`"What is?"`
`"I will have nothing to do with you.`
` ...I will carry out the fate that has been given to me.`
` So I won't entertain you."`
`"......{i:Nothing to do with youuu}...?"`
`The witch's features twisted in hatred for just an instant.`
`...It disappeared immediately,`
` but that expression that rose to her face for only a brief time was unusual for the witch, who had never broken her malicious smile.`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` ...I suppose that's one way to resist?`
` Interesting.`
` I like it.`
` I'll kill you.`
` Together with your lover...!"`
`"...If that is the fate that you have decided, that is up to you.`
` ......I won't be afraid of that or go against that.`
` Because I don't believe that the grim fate that will start occurring now is something controlled by your will."`
`"We humans don't know anything about our possible future fates.`
` That is how we live to the fullest, following our own beliefs and destinies until the last.`
` Fate is just a roll of the dice.`
` You can't feel malice in it.`
` Try as you might to inject some, I won't believe you."`
`"......Hoh.`
` Even though you have stopped being furniture, you have no fear of death.`
` ......It seems you think that will bore me, but that's a huge misunderstanding.`
` ...I am now all the more interested to see whether you really can stick to that until your last moments.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"It's so frustrating.`
` ......Why did you take the form of a human, appear in front of us, speak with human words, and ridicule us?`
` ...If you hadn't appeared in front of us, if you hadn't predicted the future,`
` ......we would have been able to live life to the fullest until the last moment."`
`"That's what witches do.`
` We live off your fates, reigning as a high‐order being does over low‐order beings.`
` After all, your fates are merely fragments.`
` If we cup our hands together, we can scoop out as many as we want."`
`"......In the same way that the beef cattle I raise can babble what they will, and it won't change the fact that they will add splendor to my dinner table.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"......We are powerless, so we can't go against your ritual or our fates.`
` ...But I can do something that will make you unhappy right now."`
`"Hoh.`
` What would that be?"`
`".........I will walk away from this place right now.`
` Answering your words only entertains you.`
` Not answering your questions is the only way I can resist you."`
`"I see, I see.`
` You may be able to take a shot at me.`
` ...But you cannot defeat me, you know?`
` ......I have the power to kill anyone for eternity."`
`".........I can't wait to see how long you can keep up that resistance in an endlessly repeating cycle of death and rebirth.`
` ......{i:Don't forget it, now}.`
` You spoke those words yourself.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`"Well then, if you will excuse me.`
` If you have any business, please call me."`
`Shannon gave a reserved bow as she would to a stranger, and faced away.`
`{n}...With that gesture, maybe she really had taken a shot back at the witch, just as {f:5:Beatrice} had mentioned.`
`...Because when the witch called out again, she sounded a little more quick‐tempered than she had before.`
`"Kanon thanked me.`
` ...Aren't you going to?`
` Not going to thank me for giving you your day of rest?"`
`"Furniture will be happy about their day of rest.`
` But I am a human, you see.`
` So I have nothing to thank you for.`
` ......Will that be all?"`
`".........You plan to receive the ring from George?`
` Don't forget that if you do, I will abandon the promise I made with Kanon, the promise that you would not be selected as a sacrifice."`
`"If there is anything further, I'll have someone else come for you.`
` If you will excuse me."`
`A flat‐out interruption.`
`{n}Shannon gave no more answers.`
`And the sound of the door closing came instead of an answer.`
`It seemed that Shannon's resistance had probably struck far more deeply into the witch than Shannon herself had thought.`
`...Because an expression of hatred had once again risen to {f:5:Beatrice}'s face.`
`She had made Kanon submit, even though he hadn't been taken in until the end.`
` ...Yet after that, now it was Shannon who refused to submit, when until now she had been easily taken in.`
`"...............Oh?`
` ...This is interesting after all!`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` ...I suppose I'm not so old yet.`
` This is why I'm still not tired of living after one thousand years..."`
`The most fabulous time in the family conference.`
`{n}That was the dinner.`
`Back when Kinzo had been serious about the family conference, he had placed extreme importance upon this dinner, for which everyone would gather just once a year.`
`Should the dinner not meet standards, he would take it as the deepest shame for himself as the host,`
` and he had strongly ordered Natsuhi to make absolutely sure that it was one to be proud of.`
`Because of that, she and Krauss had employed Gohda, who had confidence in his cooking abilities.`
`......As a result, they could unveil a wonderful dinner they had confidence in,`
` yet by that time, Kinzo had started closing himself up in his study and no longer appeared for dinner—maybe you could call that ironic...`
`When the main dish for tonight, calf steak, was set out, Gohda began to brag about it, further exciting everyone's appetite.`
`"The sauce here is Bordelaise."`
`"Of course, the red wine base I used was excellent even among those made in Bordeaux, but in addition, I prepared an original blend of this house,`
` a blend of choice alcohols from around the world to further deepen the taste."`
`"This sauce will be exclusive to this year.`
` It would greatly please me if you were to enjoy yourselves."`
`"...Isn't that wonderful?`
` However, isn't Bordelaise sauce common to French cooking?`
` It almost seems like using alcohol from outside France with that is heresy."`
`"Krauss‐sama.`
` Today is the annual family conference."`
`"As a dinner for those who normally live far away, and have traveled far from across the world to gather together,`
` I realized that a sauce made from a blend of fine alcohols from across the world that would normally never meet would be most fitting,`
` so I had it specially prepared."`
`"Wonderful!`
` A truly wonderful cook, that's what you are!`
` Food and medicine work twice as well if you advertise it right!`
` It's twice as delicious as normal food, and the advertisin' makes that twice as good again.`
` The taste keeps doublin' and doublin'!`
` Wahahahahaha!"`
`"*giggle*.`
` Come on, Nii‐san.`
` Didn't he see that question coming?"`
`"No doubt.`
` You let Gohda‐san run right off with your moment."`
`"Is that so?`
` I just thought there might be some people here who didn't notice that today's food was in the French style."`
`"......Just now, Eva said that not using butter was a virtue, but that's the Spanish style.`
` ...Well, I guess they do share a border, right?"`
`"...That's not what I meant.`
` Will you please not take a part of the conversation out of context and misquote me?"`
`"...It's a very delicious sauce.`
` Gohda‐san, you certainly are wonderful."`
`"It is a great honor to receive your praise.`
` And this is all thanks to Madam's habitual guidance."`
`"......No, it was all Gohda's idea.`
` I only listened to the recipe and approved of it."`
`It looked like the siblings quickly got into a loud argument about something as trivial as the sauce,`
` ...but for the most part, dinner proceeded peacefully.`
`......However, the thing that they all really wanted to ask about smoldered inside each of their hearts.`
`......And that was the visitor, the 19th person.`
`{n}............The Golden Witch.`
`In actuality, Eva, Rudolf, and Kyrie were on alert during dinner.`
`If the mystery guest was to be introduced, this dinner table was the most appropriate place to do it.`
` ...However, no plates had been prepared at the table for the witch.`
`The family conference would begin in earnest after the meal, and previous experiences told them that it could last until deep into the night.`
`......But they couldn't understand what meaning there could be in keeping this person, who should be introduced, hidden until late at night.`
`So Eva, Rudolf, and Kyrie had started to suspect something.`
`......That the guest might actually be unknown to Krauss as well.`
`If she wasn't a saboteur called by Krauss to give him an advantage in the inheritance problem,`
` ...they should probably speak frankly to Krauss beforehand, and create a common front to resist anything disadvantageous to the four siblings.`
`......If she was Kinzo's saboteur,`
` whose purpose was to keep the inheritance from being handed over to the four siblings,`
` the enmity between Krauss and the other siblings could become nothing more than a weak point that benefitted the enemy...`
`"Well then, please enjoy at your leisure..."`
`With the table set and the cuisine explained, Gohda tried to leave the room, but Kyrie called him to a stop with a small voice.`
`"......Yes, Kyrie‐sama.`
` What is it?"`
`"Umm, I'm sorry.`
` ......I thought there was a guest here today—will we not be seeing her at dinner...?"`
`She had thought she'd said it nonchalantly, but unfortunately, it reached the ears of Natsuhi, who was sitting in the next seat.`
`It seemed that Natsuhi had heard it to mean "even though there are guests here today, won't the host be coming to dinner?"`
` ......In other words, that Kyrie had asked whether Kinzo was going to come to dinner.`
`"The head's condition is not good, so he said that he will take his dinner in his study.`
` ......My husband explained that in the beginning; is something...?"`
`"..................I'm sorry.`
` That's not what I meant."`
`...In an instant, Kyrie realized from Natsuhi's reaction that this unknown visitor was also unknown to Krauss and his wife.`
`.........And what that meant...`
` ......On the chessboard placed inside Kyrie's mind, she could feel the arrangement of the pieces changing, making loud clattering sounds...`
`"A guessst?"`
`It seemed that Battler, who was sitting next to Natsuhi, had heard Kyrie's words without misunderstanding them,`
` and he let out a wild voice, questioning who else could have been invited to today's family conference.`
`Thanks to that voice, the uncomfortable feeling in the siblings' chests suddenly exploded...`
`Everyone looked at Gohda at the same time.`
`......Judging by their appearances, it was obvious that at least no one here had invited that mystery woman.`
`For an instant, Gohda was startled to find everyone's gaze gathered on him, but because of his naturally vain personality, this actually gave him a feeling of superiority.`
`Therefore, he answered in an extremely calm and graceful manner.`
`"......Yes.`
` She wanted to eat alone in the VIP room, so her food was carried over there."`
`Therefore, Gohda's extremely graceful and reasonable response made it obvious to everyone that a 19th person, a visitor, existed...`
`"The VIP room? A guest?`
` ......What and who are you talking about?"`
`Natsuhi's words echoed the question that everyone who didn't know about the visit of the Golden Witch was thinking.`
`Gohda was slightly disoriented, as though he hadn't remotely expected to be questioned by Natsuhi.`
`......That honored guest had been spoken of so stringently.`
`{n}He hadn't imagined that Krauss and his wife might not have known.`
`"Umm, ......it is {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` See, see!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} came, uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`Maria had been telling the other cousins over and over again that she had met {f:5:Beatrice} today.`
`......The cousins had answered, saying "Isn't that nice", but they hadn't believed.`
` So, ...their eyes grew wide.`
`"S‐sorry.`
` I was sure you were just joking, Maria...`
` S‐so, she really does exist..."`
`".........By {f:5:Beatrice}, ......you mean that {f:5:Beatrice} of the gold...?!"`
`"Uu!!`
` I've been saying she "exists" the whole time!`
` No one believed!!"`
`"Sorry, Maria‐chan...`
` We didn't mean to..."`
`After learning that everyone had doubted {f:5:Beatrice}'s existence, Maria, who had been in a good mood all day, completely lost her temper.`
`...George, who was sitting next to her, tried frantically to calm her.`
`"...Gohda.`
` Is that another bit of dinner entertainment?`
` *cackle*, quite a good performance."`
`".........Aniki.`
` Drop the act.`
` ...You called her, right?"`
`"Called?`
` Called who?`
` ...From where?!"`
`"Nii‐san.`
` Let's have a clear answer.`
` ......Who is that?`
` Surely you aren't going to tell us that it really is the {f:5:Beatrice} from that portrait, right?"`
`"I don't have a clue what you people are talking about!`
` Gohda, is this seriously not a joke?!"`
`"I, I, umm......`
` I was just ordered by Genji‐san, umm...!"`
`"Call Genji.`
` Now!!"`
`When Natsuhi yelled, Gohda shot out into the hallway.`
`The sound of the door being thrown open at that time triggered a sudden uproar around the dinner table.`
`"So you say you don't know either, Aniki?`
` Who called her?`
` Was it Dad?!"`
`"......I don't know anything about this.`
` It seems that you people believe that I have been pulling the strings behind the scenes, but that is a huge misunderstanding."`
`"Calm down, Krauss nii‐san.`
` We aren't at the stage where we can sound each other out anymore.`
` If you're sayin' that you don't know this mystery person either, this situation becomes ridiculous...!"`
`"Hideyoshi‐san, won't you be a little more discreet with your words?`
` My husband would not invite unnecessary people to the family conference."`
`"Honestly.`
` What are you people talking about?`
` Are you saying that the witch of the portrait has broken out of her frame and appeared?!`
` ......There's no way anyone has actually met this witch."`
`"I...met her...!"`
`Eva and Rudolf nodded at Rosa's proclamation.`
`"Uu!`
` I met her too!!`
` Uncle Krauss, belieeeve!`
` Believe Mama!`
` Uu‐uu!"`
`The brief tension was broken, and Maria also started to make a ruckus.`
`{n}...The room was by now chaotic.`
`"I don't have a clue what's going on...`
` So what's going on?`
` The witch who gave Grandfather the gold is appearing as a special guest in this year's family conference...?!"`
`"But... Really...?`
` Auntie Rosa didn't see it wrong, did she...?"`
`"I met her toooooo!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`"Auntie Rosa, ......are you...sure?"`
`"............Yes.`
` .........Maria and I met her, ......and even talked to her."`
`"......I met her!!`
` That was definitely a witch...!`
` Believe me!!`
` I definitely didn't see it wrong or hallucinate or anything!`
` What.........{i:was} that?!"`
`...In the instant before the typhoon visited...`
`{n}......Rosa had definitely met with the witch in the rose garden.`
`But that scene had been so hard to accept as reality......`
`and the more she spoke of it like this, the less she understood what it was she had met.`
`Ironically, because she had lost her composure when she said that she had definitely met the witch,`
` the more desperate she became, the more vague the witch's existence seemed.`
`So, it was a single composed sentence that affirmed her existence for certain.`
`".........I met her as well.`
` We exchanged greetings—well, they could hardly be called that—a few words, at least.`
` .........It's definitely not something that Rosa‐san saw wrong."`
`"Kyrie‐san, are you serious...?"`
`"Yes.`
` .........But she didn't tell me her name.`
` So I can't conclude that she was {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......However, sorry if this is subjective,`
` ......but since I met her in the entrance hall, I was able to compare her face with the portrait.`
` ...My first impression was that she was undoubtedly the portrait's subject.`
` .........This is all just subjective, remember."`
`"That isn't possible!`
` In the first place, where did that woman come from?`
` The only boat today was the round‐trip journey of the one that escorted you all here.`
` Was she riding on that boat?!"`
`".....................`
` I admit, that's a bit of a weak spot.`
` Of course, I have no memory of such a woman getting off the boat with us."`
`"Ooh, is it really?`
` How can you prove that there wasn't a boat other than the one we rode on?`
` You can't!`
` You can't prove one "{i:didn't come}"!"`
`"That's right.`
` ......You could prove that it "came".`
` Someone who saw it just has to say so.`
` But you can't prove that it "didn't come"."`
`"Even if everyone says that it didn't come—that they didn't see it—you can't deny that it could have "come secretly".`
` It's that thing they call the "Devil's Proof"."`
`It's easy to prove that a devil "exists".`
`{n}All you have to do is meet a devil.`
`{n}But it is impossible to prove that devils "don't exist".`
`Just because no one has ever met a devil doesn't mean that you can deny the possibility that they're hiding away somewhere that humans cannot go.`
`......You can't deny the existence of aliens for exactly the same reasons.`
`Until humanity searches the whole of space and can show perfectly that aliens don't exist, you can't be sure that they don't.`
`And it's definitely impossible for us to ever check the entirety of space for the existence of aliens.`
`...Therefore, while there may be a number of ways to prove that aliens do exist, it is impossible to show proof that denies their existence.`
`"......In that case, we would just be wasting our time discussing whether or not a boat separate from the one we rode on came to the island.`
` ......She wasn't on the boat with us.`
` That much is a fact, and she must have visited this island through some other means."`
`"That's right.`
` There may be no need to discuss how she came here.`
` The essential point is the fact that she actually is in this mansion now, and doesn't feel like having dinner with us."`
`"Let's review.`
` ...Right now, there is another guest on this island other than the 18 of the Ushiromiya family.`
` And that is a guest that even Aniki and Natsuhi nee‐san don't know about, right?"`
`"I don't know...!`
` I don't know what you're talking about...!"`
`"Be silent for a while.`
` Your headache will get worse.`
` ......It is as my wife says.`
` I have no idea what you people have been talking about up until now."`
`"Then there can be only one answer.`
` ......Father called her.`
` For today's family conference!"`
`"For the family conference?!`
` Then for what reason?!"`
`"I don't know that!`
` I thought you knew, Nii‐san, that's why I thought I'd question you!"`
`"Eva, could you give it a rest?!`
` Krauss nii‐san said that he doesn't know!`
` ......So this is what we've got.`
` Father stealthily invited the witch of the portrait as a secret guest.`
` And Rosa‐san met her, Maria‐chan met her, and Kyrie‐san met her too."`
`".........That's all we know for now!`
` If she has something to say to us, she could just quickly show herself!`
` So what I want to know is why in blazes she's shut herself up without greetin' us."`
`"You think maybe Dad never had any interest in the family conference from the beginning, and just secretly called a new mistress here?`
` And had her dress up as his ideal witch?`
` ............Nah, this day holds too much significance to come to that conclusion."`
`"There can be only one reason.`
` To join in on the family conference.`
` ...She wants to claim some right to Father's inheritance!"`
`"Preposterous!!`
` The head would never have something as filthy as a mistress!"`
`"I told you to be silent!`
` I've been in this mansion with Father for considerable time, and I haven't heard about this once."`
`".........Let me humor you as best as I can...`
` ......You say Father had a hidden child with a mistress of several decades past,`
` ......and Father searched her out and called her here today.`
` ...Is that what you want to say?"`
`"Dear!`
` Father would never have something like that!`
` To waste the noble blood of the Ushiromiya family on a mistress...!`
` This is nothing more than a few people saying that they saw something!`
` It's obviously a fantasy, a delusion, a daydream!`
` Or are you all taking part in some kind of act to entrap my husband?!"`
`"What act?!!`
` If anyone is acting, it's you!!"`
`"Quit it, Aneki.`
` ......She said it in a slightly reckless way, but Natsuhi‐san is correct.`
` Kyrie saw her, but I did not.`
` Neither did you, Aneki.`
` But Rosa did."`
`"......However, that means that she "exists".`
` Because there is someone who can prove that she "exists", we directly conclude that she exists.`
` It's the opposite pattern of the Devil's Proof."`
`".........And I want to meet her too.`
` And I want to ask her directly what kind of business she has with the Ushiromiya family."`
`"I agree with you on that.`
` I truly wish to enquire as to what business she has on Rokkenjima."`
`"Don't act like you don't know!`
` She is after one thing.`
` It's Father's inheritance!`
` We should form a forward‐looking strategy with a lawyer knowledgeable about inheritance issues.`
` If the mistress claims the same rights as Mother, then our shares will be cut right in half!"`
`".........Wai‐wait a second, everybody!`
` Genji‐san will come very soon.`
` He knows everything.`
` I'm sure he will answer our questions!`
` Until then, let's stop talking about this!!"`
`"Come on now, kids!`
` Sorry, but we adults have to start talking about something a little complicated!`
` Go back to the guesthouse!!"`
`Rosa yelled at the children, slightly emotionally.`
`The children didn't understand why they were suddenly being yelled at now, but Eva and the rest came to the same realization as Rosa after a delay.`
`They were talking so grandly about the filthy topic of the inheritance in front of the children.`
`...There was no way that they'd want their children to remain here.`
`{n}So they all immediately agreed with Rosa's plan.`
`"Tha‐that's right, just as Rosa‐san says!`
` George!`
` Take all the cousins and go back to the guesthouse!`
` You all play nice together, you hear?!"`
`"George, do as you're told.`
` Take all of the cousins, and leave right now!"`
`"Wa‐...wait a second, Mother...!`
` We haven't even finished eating yet...!"`
`"Uu!`
` And we still haven't had desserrrrt!!`
` Uuu!!"`
`"We will have Gohda‐san carry dessert to the guesthouse!`
` So leave!!"`
`"Jessica.`
` From here on, the adults will be talking together.`
` Go."`
`".........Fi‐...fine.`
` .........Even though it's only half‐eaten..."`
`"...So I guess I'm not going to be the only exception."`
`"Thank you for understanding, Battler‐kun.`
` ...But you're lucky, you know."`
`"Huh?`
` Why?"`
`"I'd want to leave if I could."`
`"...Ihihihi!`
` I bet you would.`
` I'll let you adults enjoy your happy family chat about the inheritance."`
`"............I will also leave my seat.`
` It appears that I have no place here tonight."`
`Nanjo softly rose from his seat.`
`...He had been calmly watching the whole discussion from his seat at the farthest corner of the table, without pointlessly interrupting.`
` ......His reaction was very adult, like a calm old gentleman.`
`When Nanjo rose from his seat, it urged on the other people who were supposed to leave.`
`As the children noisily rose from their seats, a commotion was heard in the hallway as the servants returned.`
`"I apologize for taking so long...`
` I have called Genji..."`
`"......I was checking to see that all of the doors and windows were shut, so it took me some time.`
` My apologies."`
`"Come on! Children, to the guesthouse!`
` Gohda‐san, I'm very sorry, but could you carry the desserts for the children to the guesthouse?"`
`"I see...`
` ...Is that what you wish...?"`
`It seemed that Gohda did not appreciate that the dinner he had worked so hard on was going to be interrupted like this.`
`...He sent Natsuhi a look as though asking her whether that was really alright.`
`"Do as Rosa‐san says.`
` Also, it will not be necessary to set out dessert for us.`
` Be sure not to approach the dining hall until we call you.`
` Tell that to the rest of the servants too.`
` Understood?"`
`"Ye‐...yes.`
` Certainly..."`
`"Come, everyone.`
` Shall we go?`
` Maria‐san, you too, you must not trouble your mother any further."`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` I wanna talk about Beato!!`
` No no no, uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`"Maria‐chan,`
` will you tell us about {f:5:Beatrice} in the guesthouse?`
` ...I really want to hear about the witch.`
` Okay?"`
`"Uu?`
` Uu!"`
`"......You're really good, George nii‐san.`
` I'm impressed."`
`"Are you sure you don't have kids?`
` You're too used to this, ihihi!"`
`Maria's mood was completely back to normal at George's words, and she even took the initiative in hurrying everyone to go to the guesthouse.`
`It looked like Gohda didn't like being kicked out himself, but he was unable to disobey Natsuhi, and left the room with Battler and the rest, closing the door...`
`"......Do you all have some business with me?"`
`"Yes, we do.`
` A bunch of it.`
` And that goes for all of us.`
` So much that we almost want to draw lots to see who asks the first question."`
`"Though I believe that no matter who draws the winning lot, the first question would be the same."`
`"No doubt.`
` .........Genji‐san.`
` Answer us honestly.`
` ...This woman called {f:5:Beatrice} in the VIP room right now... Who is she?"`
