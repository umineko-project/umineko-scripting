`Battler could be found in the dining hall.`
`Unable to summon the will to return to the guesthouse in the middle of this rain,`
` he had wandered halfheartedly around the mansion in search of a random place to sit, ...and had stationed himself in the dining hall.`
`He hadn't bothered to lock it.`
`He did think that maybe the shapeless murderer, or the Golden Witch, might come to kill him now that he was isolated,`
` but he no longer thought about resisting that.`
`On the contrary, he had no intention of blocking the culprit with a lock.`
`{n}He wanted that person to come at him openly, from the front.`
`...If it was a murderer, he thought he'd ask them to tell about some of those wonderful locked room tricks as a parting souvenir.`
`And if it was a witch, he thought he'd ask her to at least take his life with some wonderful magic.`
`......However, ironically, neither of these two came to meet Battler...`
`Battler opened the liquor cabinet on his own and enjoyed the liquor to his heart's content.`
`{n}No longer was there anybody anywhere who would have a problem with him drinking alcohol.`
`He boldly set both of his legs on the extravagant tablecloth and savored the high‐quality liquor, which probably had a mind‐boggling price, straight from the neck of the bottle....`
`At that time, ......someone knocked.`
`Battler realized that he was about to meet his maker...`
`"Heee~yy, it's not locked.`
` Come in, whoever you are.`
` And please introduce yourself.`
` If you're human, gimme your name.`
` And if you're {f:5:Beatrice}, gimme your three sizes."`
`"You might not believe this, but I'm a pretty well‐known breast‐sommelier, y'sheee?"`
`".........It is Genji, Battler‐sama."`
`"...Genji‐san, huh.`
` ......Sorry, but I'm not interested in your bust size.`
` Please, come in. It's open."`
`".........Excuse me."`
`Genji‐san opened the door and bowed.`
`.........So Genji‐san was the culprit after all, ...or maybe an accomplice?`
` ......That theory would probably explain most of the tricks...`
`"Did you come to give me my last rites?"`
`".........Nothing of the sort.`
` ......I shall excuse myself if I am disturbing you."`
`"...Wait, wait, excusing yourself without even telling me what you wanted would actually just be creepy.`
` ...What do you want?`
` ...Please, let me do as I wish, at least in the very end."`
`".........Battler‐sama, is it truly your wish...`
`to spend the little time you have left in such an indolent fashion?"`
`Those words...stung...`
`{n}......Of course it wasn't.`
`"...............................`
` What can I do at this point?`
` ......I'm ready to die at any time..."`
`"......You are just like the Master.`
` Indeed, you inherited the Master's blood strongly...."`
`"You mean to tell me that Grandfather, that larger‐than‐life man, was actually willing to die at any moment...?`
` First I've heard of that."`
`".........The Master's life,`
` ......after a number of sad incidents,`
` ......was completely reduced to atonement."`
`"...What do you know?"`
`"............{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's ritual has been entirely completed up to the eighth twilight.`
` ...I believe...that I can now tell you everything."`
`"Wha‐......what did you say...?"`
`My drunkenness was completely blown away.`
` I lowered my feet from the table and listened carefully to hear what kind of words Genji‐san would say next...`
`"Battler‐sama.`
` ......I shall guide you to the Master's study.`
` ......It would probably be better to hear it directly from them."`
`"From......them...?`
` H‐hey, what in the world do you mean by that...!!"`
`"......Come, this way.`
` I shall guide you.`
` Battler‐sama."`
`After Genji‐san told me to follow him, he started to walk down the corridor.`
`I sobered up completely and went after him...`
`We climbed the big staircase, .........towards the third floor.`
`{n}Genji‐san stopped walking halfway.`
`{n}He then turned back and spoke.`
`".........Battler‐sama.`
` ......From here on, you will...`
`......probably see things you will not be able to understand."`
`"Don't try to intimidate me.`
` .........I've already seen plenty of things I can't understand today."`
`".........Please accept what you see as you see it,`
` and what you hear as you hear it."`
`"Questions like "Why?",`
` or "What?",`
` ...there is no need for such things.`
` ...Battler‐sama, you will probably simply learn the truth.`
` Whether to accept it, believe it,`
` or even deny it, are all choices I leave to you."`
`"....................................."`
`Genji‐san checked one last time to see whether I was prepared to learn the truth.`
`The eighth twilight had already ended.`
` And on the ninth twilight, the witch revives, ......and none shall be left alive.`
`It meant that {f:5:Beatrice} had already revived.`
`{n}...And probably, none of us would be allowed to return alive.`
`If I was going lose my life anyway, ......I wanted to know the truth in the end.`
`{n}...It didn't matter how hard it might be to accept.`
`"..................Yeah.`
` ......Even if a demon or a witch shows up, ...I'm prepared."`
`".........You really are just like the Master in his youth.`
` ......Battler‐sama, please be diligent in your studies.`
` In the future, you will surely have great aspirations.`
` And make sure that at that time, you are not forced into a lifetime of regret by a lack of academic knowledge."`
`".........If I have a chance to work hard in my studies, then no problem."`
`".............................."`
`Genji‐san's silence forced me to consider that resignation of mine more deeply...`
`And, .........we could see the door of Grandfather's study, impregnated with a sweet smell.`
`From his pocket, Genji‐san withdrew a gold key with an elegant design.`
`The master keys had been confiscated by Auntie Rosa, but the key to this study alone, he had kept with him.`
`He put it in the keyhole, .........and it made a heavy clunking sound.`
`".........My lord.`
` It is Genji.`
` I have brought Battler‐sama with me."`
`There was no reply, but it seemed that permission to go in had been given...`
`"Come, Battler‐sama.`
` ......Please enter."`
`"..................Yeah.`
` ......In I go."`
`I readied myself, ......and threw the door open...`
`At that moment, ...I got slightly disoriented by the dazzling golden glow..........`
`It was, .........somehow,`
` ......a swarm of butterflies, shining gold.`
`The golden butterflies that were completely filling the inside of the study poured out all at once.......`
`"Wha‐............`
` ......What the heck...`
`......is thiiiss.................."`
`It was almost like golden leaf confetti.`
`{n}The interior of Grandfather's study was filled with a golden glow...`
`And......there were reception sofas and a table for guests placed in front of the study desk,`
` .........and I could see Grandfather's back.`
`There was someone on the side opposite from Grandfather.`
`{n}...It was in shadow, so I couldn't see it well...`
`"......My lord.`
` I have brought Battler‐sama."`
`"............Battler, is it?`
` I'm busy thinking now...`
` Be silent for a while......"`
`Kinzo declared that in displeasure, his back still turned.`
`It seemed that he was enjoying playing chess with a visitor...`
`Apparently, the opponent had counterattacked with a superb move.`
`{n}Kinzo seemed to be enjoying himself as he thought deeply, while occasionally laughing and groaning...`
`"I thought for thirty years.`
` ......I thought for thirty years about how to counterattack this move...`
` Have fun, have fun with the move I fermented for thirty years."`
`"......Heheheheheheheh.`
` Indeed, this is a deeply matured move.`
` ......Such fun, such fun... *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, hahahahahahaha...!!`
` Unbeatable, unbeatable."`
`"......Wha‐`
`............what is...`
`......this........."`
`"So you came, Battler.`
` Wait just a moment.`
` Be silent for Kinzo's sake.`
` ...Isn't it too early to resign, Kinzo?`
` I can already counterattack for several moves.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`It should have been...`
`...my first meeting with that witch.`
`However, ...I knew this witch.`
`{n}Even though it was our first meeting,`
` ...I knew her,`
` ......from the portrait......!`
`"Genji.`
` Serve something for Battler.`
` What would be the most appropriate for this man...?"`
`"......The same which the Master has loved since the days of his youth."`
`"That is ideal; serve it to him.`
` ......You did well coming here, Ushiromiya Battler.`
` First, take a seat."`
`".........You called my name many times, did you not?`
` In deference to that, I allowed you to meet me.`
` ...So, what will you ask me?`
` What will you inquire?"`
`"......The door to the Golden Land will soon be opened.`
` Soon, we will have a banquet to celebrate my revival, to which I will be welcoming the witches.`
` ...In the meantime, I'll be answering your questions, as many as you like."`
`"I, ......I have a bunch of things I want to ask about!!`
` What happened on this island?!`
` And why did these incidents happen?!"`
`"I want to ask about the locked rooms too!!`
` What about the chapel?!`
` What about Jessica's room?!`
` And the servant room?!`
` And Aunt Natsuhi's room?!`
` And the parlor?!"`
`"There's more still I want to ask about!!`
` About the witch's true nature!!`
` Are you really a witch?!!`
` What is your purpose, what do you want to make us do and why did you call me here?!!`
` Answer me, about everything!!!"`
`"Arrrrghhh, be quiet!!`
` You think merely asking will get you answers?!?!"`
`"Don't say that, Kinzo.`
` A fragile and fleeting spider web did protect from King Herod once.`
` ......Just as there are no useless things in this world, there are also no useless questions."`
`"Very well, I'll answer all your questions.`
` ......But, I do have one condition."`
`"What is it?"`
`"Once you have heard everything, if you are satisfied of my existence,`
` ............kneel, and kiss my shoes.`
` I called you here because I wanted to make you submit to me."`
`"...Kinzo and I made a bet.`
` We bet on which would come first, Kinzo thinking of a new move, or me forcing you to submit.`
` I don't see myself losing.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"...D‐............Damn you, talking so tough!!`
` Yeah, alright.`
` Try to make me admit it.`
` ...Try to make me admit that you're a witch and that you can use weird, awesome, and great magic!!"`
`"If I submit, I'll kiss your shoes or do whatever else you want!!!"`
`The witch cackled gloatingly.`
`{n}Then, she glared at him unpleasantly with eyes that said a man can't go back on his word...`
`"Well said!!`
` So, from what question shall I begin?!`
` I'll answer everything!!`
` Come, what will the first one be?!?!"`
