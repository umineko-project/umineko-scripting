`After Genji finished taking his late meal, he went out to do the nighttime rounds inside the mansion.`
`He reheated the soup that Gohda had started making, and ate some random leftovers from the refrigerator.`
`They were all things Gohda had made himself, and were, of course, delicious.`
`He had half‐heartedly gone to ask Rosa and the others what they would do for dinner, but he had been yelled at by a voice telling him that they had canned food so they were fine, and the door wasn't even opened for him.`
`......So, ironically, it was the servant Genji who was able to eat the more delicious meal...`
`But even though all of those crimes had been committed, and many people had already met a brutal end,`
` ......why was it that Genji wasn't afraid to do the rounds all by himself?`
`...Judging by his appearance as he carried out his normal tasks without a trace of fear, as though everything was normal,`
` you might think that all of the horrible events that had happened today were just a dream or an illusion.`
`Was he taking a philosophic view, or was it simply resignation?`
`Genji must have considered it a virtue to systematically carry out his duty until the last moment,`
` since the fate that awaited him was unavoidable.`
`It would probably be eternally impossible to perceive the depths of his heart, unless he told of it himself......`
`Because he had given the master key back to Rosa, the places he could go to were extremely limited.`
`All he could do was walk around the hallways, checking to make sure that the windows were closed.`
`{n}So he was able to go around that route far more quickly than usual.`
`".......................................`
` ......mgh."`
`After the sound of a moderate knock,`
` Auntie Rosa, who had been falling into a doze shortly before, jumped and woke up, pointing the barrel of the gun at the door as she yelled.`
`"Who is it?!"`
`I was napping on a sofa, and that voice also brought me back to reality.`
`"......Rosa‐sama.`
` It is Genji."`
`"Do you have some business?`
` We'll be fine without opening the door.`
` Tell us from there."`
`".........Yes.`
` Well then, forgive me for speaking in this fashion.`
` ...I have found the bodies of Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa."`
`"Wh‐...what did you say...?!!"`
`"............I see.`
` Alright, let's go and check them.`
` ...Until I see the corpses, I won't believe anybody."`
`"....................."`
`"......Uu.`
` It's alright, Battler.`
` If you're with me, it'll definitely be alright."`
`Maybe my face was shadowed with anxiety.`
`{n}...Maria grasped my hand with her small hand, and spoke softly, trying to give me courage.`
`Since it was Auntie Rosa's job to ready the gun and stand guard, it fell to me to remove the barricade of sofas.`
`When I finished, I took a backward glance at Auntie Rosa, who was pointing the barrel of the gun over my shoulder, and opened the door.`
`"Genji‐san, where are their corpses...?"`
`".........In the courtyard.`
` I shall guide you."`
`"Battler‐kun, wait!`
` Just in case, I'm going to check the doors and windows of this room before we go.`
` Wait a second."`
`Auntie Rosa called me to a halt to prevent me from going on ahead, and began to carefully check the locks on each of the windows.`
`......But those locks had already been checked once.`
`......It felt kind of unpleasant, as though she suspected that I might have secretly unlocked them when she wasn't looking.`
`...No, maybe she was right to be this cautious...`
`Even though it was called a courtyard, it wasn't really a pretty place you could take a walk in like the rose garden.`
`On the contrary, since it was surrounded by the mansion on all sides,`
` it made you feel a little discomfort, as though it was telling you that you couldn't escape from the mansion even if you tried to escape to the outside.`
`On the other hand, thanks to that, even though the violent winds could be heard, the wind itself was blocked.`
`Genji‐san held out an umbrella, but Auntie Rosa ignored him.`
`...She probably wanted to say that the gun took two hands, so taking the umbrella would be dangerous because she wouldn't be able to fire the gun.`
`Even without Genji‐san pointing his finger, we could tell immediately.`
`Right in the center of the courtyard, ......we could see where Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa‐san lay...`
`Auntie Rosa entered the courtyard without even an umbrella.`
`{n}...So Genji‐san and I also entered the courtyard without opening one.`
`{n}Only Maria had one open like normal.`
`"..................Maria...`
` ......Is this......you know?"`
`"......Uu.`
` ......It's the seventh twilight and the eighth twilight."`
`"I, ......I see.`
` Certainly, just as Genji‐san and the others said, there are horrible wounds on their necks.`
` ......Very sharp.`
` Almost as though they've been sliced with a katana or something..."`
`That gaping wound on their necks definitely made me want to avert my eyes,`
` but after seeing the Halloween party in the chapel, even though I thought it was horrible, it was no longer enough to make me feel sick.`
`Instead, our gazes were directed to their legs.`
`{n}In Doctor Nanjo's knee.`
` In Kumasawa‐san's ankle.`
`......Driven into each of them was something like a knife or a stake with a demonic decoration.`
`...They would surely be the same as the one that had pierced Jessica's back.`
`"......What is this?`
` ...It's the same as Jessica‐chan.`
` Is this supposed to be some kind of occult ritual, I wonder?"`
`".........I do not know.`
` The last time I saw their bodies, there was nothing like this.`
` Maybe it was done after they were carried out of the servant room."`
`The one that had been stuck into Doctor Nanjo's knee was still standing erect,`
` but the one that had been thrust into Kumasawa‐san's ankle might have been a little shallower.`
` It had come out and fallen over.`
`So, it was only when I saw that one that had fallen over, that for the first time, I realized that it wasn't a knife,`
` but something like a stake.`
`Its full length was probably about thirty centimeters.`
`{n}It was probably made out of bronze or iron or something of the sort.`
`Even without touching it, I could tell that it had some weight to it.`
`{n}It was composed of a grip and a cone‐shaped part, and it was obviously made to be a piercing weapon.`
`Maybe you could describe it like a miniature version of those lances Western knights used on horseback.`
`The grooves that had been carved in a spiral shape made it also look like a drill.`
`......However, the grip had an occult‐like design of a demon or something,`
` so instead of a weapon used in war,`
` it felt like something that would be used in a ritual to offer up a sacrifice.`
`"......There's no mistake.`
` ...They're meant to be...sacrifices."`
`".........On the seventh twilight, gouge the knee and kill.`
` On the eighth twilight, gouge the leg and kill."`
`"Wait.`
` Then, they've left out the fourth, fifth, and sixth twilights.`
` ......D‐......don't tell me..."`
`That's right.`
`{n}Why is Genji‐san alone?!`
`If something like this had happened, why wouldn't George‐aniki, Gohda‐san, or Shannon‐chan be here?!`
` Why was Genji‐san alone?!`
`"What is this?`
` Where did George‐kun and the other two go?!"`
`".........They told me that they wanted to go to Madam Natsuhi's room to search for something, and left.`
` They have not returned yet."`
`"What did you say...?`
` Umm, you say they left, when was that?!"`
`"Two or three hours ago, I believe."`
`"N‐no way...!!`
` Why didn't you say something that important—wait, no—why didn't you think that was suspicious?!"`
`"......There must always be one servant awaiting orders.`
` It was my duty to wait for orders until they returned."`
`Was Genji‐san really this much of a robot?!`
`This is bad, this is bad, it's really bad...!!`
`The fact that Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa‐san {i:had been killed in this way} meant that three people had already been killed...!!`
`We ran towards Aunt Natsuhi's room.`
`{n}.........With a touch of anxiety, and just as much resignation.`
`Before we even saw the inside of Aunt Natsuhi's room,`
` ...we were imprisoned by a certain resignation.`
`On that door was bizarre...`
`graffiti—`
`no, filth...?`
`In any case, the door wasn't in a normal state, and we were able to imagine what was inside that room without opening it.`
`On the face of the door...... How should I say it?`
`......Someone had heavily painted their hands with the same red paint that the magic circles from before had been drawn with,`
` ...and had banged on the door, scratched it, dirtied it.`
`......It was dirtied like the aftermath of a kindergartner playing in the mud.`
`I didn't know what it could mean.`
`{n}...The bright‐red paint that had been slathered on was dripping down, and even though no one said it, it made us think of blood.`
`"...G‐...Genji‐san, please open it."`
`Auntie Rosa held her gun up high and ordered Genji‐san to open it.`
`Genji‐san approached the door without being particularly troubled by that stuff on it, and turned the knob,`
` but he immediately turned around, shaking his head.`
`It was locked.`
`Right now, there was only one person in this mansion who could lock and unlock doors at will: Auntie Rosa.`
`This time, Genji‐san asked Auntie Rosa to unlock the door, instead of the other way around.`
`After making a slightly disgruntled face, Auntie Rosa handed me a master key, and told me to open the door.`
`"......Battler‐kun, would you open it for me with this?"`
`"Just trusting Genji‐san with something like that wouldn't..."`
`Auntie Rosa glared at me with an intense gaze.`
`{n}......Getting into a fight here would only make the environment turn even more sour.`
`Without talking back any more, I approached that creepy door, and tried the knob.`
` ......It didn't open.`
`It was definitely the resistance of the lock.`
`{n}I stuck the master key into the keyhole.`
`Clunk.`
` A light resistance.`
`While listening to Auntie Rosa as she told me to be cautious, I opened the door without being particularly cautious at all.`
`And there.........was the scene, laid out before us, not betraying our expectations in the slightest.`
`"...........................!`
` How...horrible......"`
`"....................."`
`"As I thought, ......it was a reproduction of the fourth, fifth, and sixth twilights."`
`".........Uu."`
`The inside of the room looked as though a robber had just broken in.`
`Drawers were flung open, pulled out, with their contents thrown all over the floor,`
` the room devastated so that it looked nothing like the room of the methodical Aunt Natsuhi.`
`But the thing that caught the eye before that...`
`......was Gohda‐san's body lying facedown right in front of the door...`
`One of those demon stakes had been rammed right into the center of his chest, almost as though it had been stuck there to finish off a vampire.`
`......Exactly how far would it have reached after being stuck that deeply into his chest?`
`...My own chest hurt just imagining it.`
`"...Gouge the chest was the fifth twilight?"`
`"............Uu."`
`Maria grabbed my hand.`
`......Her expression looked just like normal,`
` ...but maybe she really was afraid of the aura in this room where three bodies lay.`
`And, along the wall farthest into the room, George‐aniki was dead.`
`......This time, one of those stakes had been rammed right in the center of his stomach.`
`{n}...Gouging the stomach was the sixth twilight, I think.`
`Shannon‐chan's body was face down over the front of the dresser, lying in a sea of blood.`
`In its horribly broken mirror, sprayed with blood, had she seen her final worldly expression?`
`...Because she was face down, I couldn't see her face, but I could imagine even without seeing it.`
`Nearby, in the sea of blood she lay in, a demon's stake had fallen...`
`......Only the fourth twilight was left.`
`{n}Gouge the head and kill...`
`Maybe my heart was completely tired out and dead...`
`Even though I knew what I was doing was wrong, ...I lifted her head, and checked.`
`......And confirmed that my guess was right on the mark.`
`There was a gaping hole in Shannon‐chan's forehead, and her insides were dripping out.`
`Not only that, ...you could even see...inside her.`
`After seeing that, I finally noticed that what I was doing was wrong.`
`I immediately averted my eyes, but by now, it was probably pointless.`
`"Hey, Battler‐kun!!`
` We have to leave everything alone until the police come!!`
` What do you think you're doing, touching it?!`
` What will you do if our precious evidence from the crime scene gets disturbed?!!"`
`Auntie Rosa yelled furiously at me, and even yanked the back of my collar.`
`I tottered limply and fell on my butt, ......and gazed dimly up at the ceiling...`
`"......Maria."`
`"Uu......?"`
`"......Now even the eighth twilight is over.`
` ......What was the ninth twilight again?"`
`"...........................`
` ...On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive."`
`"I see.`
` ......So now, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} will be revived.`
` ......What then?`
` ...On the final tenth twilight?"`
`"...On the tenth twilight, the journey ends, and you shall reach the Home of the Gold.`
` .........Very soon, the door to the Golden Land will be opened.`
` ...Very soon."`
`".........The witch revives, and none shall be left alive, you say.`
` .........We're going to die?`
` Or is the sacrificial ritual over now, ...and our journey will end, and we can make it to the Golden Land...?"`
`"................................."`
`"......Our journey, yeah right.`
` ......We've spent the whole day trying to find the culprit, racking our brains as we tried to break out of this situation,`
` ...and we haven't gotten anywhere.`
` It's like they say—thinking stupid is no better than sleeping."`
`"That's right, we've spent the whole day burning ourselves up with hatred and paranoia.`
` ......We said we could only trust dead people,`
` ...and we came all the way here just to check out their dead faces...`
` ...If we're like this,`
` ......how...`
`......can you say we can make it to the Golden Land......"`
`That's right... ......If nothing could be solved, it would have been much better if we had locked ourselves up the whole time without thinking at all.`
`Grandfather was the wisest of us.`
`{n}He's been shut up in his room since yesterday, without any contact with anyone.`
`......That would have been fine.`
`{n}Grandfather was the most correct...`
`"......It'll be alright, Battler.`
` ......If you're with me, it'll be alright.`
` .........Witches are very fickle, and they're terrifying beings who maybe kill humans for fun sometimes."`
`"...But, if you're together with me, it'll definitely be alright.`
` So, don't be afraid."`
`".........Thank you.`
` ......Even if that's just to comfort me, ...it makes me happy."`
`After Auntie Rosa finished investigating their deaths, she proclaimed that she would seal this room again,`
` chased the rest of us out, stole back the master key she had lent me, and locked the door again.`
`It seemed that George‐aniki had been holding the original key to Aunt Natsuhi's room.`
` She had also collected that.`
`............Wait a second.`
`{n}She had all of the master keys in her hand.`
`And if the original key had been shut up inside that room,`
` ......wasn't this another locked room?`
`So this is a fourth locked room......?`
`Now that we had been released from our suspicion of those three, ......we once again returned to the parlor.`
`I don't have a clue what's going on anymore.`
`......If only the dead are safe, and everyone alive is a wolf,`
` ......then all that's left is me, Auntie Rosa, Maria, and Genji‐san.`
`......Only those, Grandfather, and that 19th person—the guest who I hadn't even sensed— {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`Thirteen people had died, and six were left.`
` ......With only six people, how would the wolves and sheep puzzle end...?`
` Even though the puzzle which had had nineteen people in it had been reduced to a mere six,`
` ......I couldn't find any answer...`
`We returned to the parlor.`
`......I felt a little anxious that, while we were gone,`
` a creepy magic circle or something might have been drawn on the door to the parlor,`
` but thankfully, there was none...`
`"Thank you, Genji‐san.`
` This is far enough.`
` Please rest for the day."`
`"......Certainly.`
` ...Then, if you will allow me to rest."`
`"H‐...hey, Auntie Rosa...`
` ......Are you saying that you'll leave Genji‐san all alone in a situation like this...?"`
`"......You are right.`
` I do think it's very dangerous."`
`"......But, in that case, why is he safe?`
` After those three headed to Natsuhi nee‐san's room, he was alone the whole time.`
` And yet he's safe."`
`"......It's the wolves and sheep puzzle.`
` Why would an isolated sheep—a sheep in its weakest position—be safe?"`
`"...P‐......probably because, by coincidence, there weren't any wolves..."`
`"Wrong.`
` Because it wasn't a sheep."`
`"Are you saying Genji‐san's...a wolf...?"`
`"He said that he was alone in the kitchen, but that's impossible to prove.`
` The only ones who could have carried Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa‐san's corpses, and who could have killed George and the rest, were him and {f:5:Beatrice}, right?"`
`"W‐wait, with that argument, anyone—"`
`"......Battler‐sama.`
` Thank you for your concern."`
`"...I believe that trust will be won not with a hundred excuses, but with a single unending faithfulness.`
` ......Even if I am not able to gain your trust, I wish to be faithful until the end."`
`".....................Genji‐san..."`
`"......Then it's settled.`
` ......If you are truly innocent, the police will prove that for us when they come tomorrow.`
` So, until then, we cannot remove you from suspicion."`
`".........After your long years of service to the Ushiromiya family, I find it truly painful to treat you so poorly.`
` ...But please understand for tonight.`
` ...Then, when tomorrow comes, please let me make up with you again."`
`Genji‐san gave his head a small shake.`
`"......Whether today or tomorrow,`
` I will continue to be a servant of the Ushiromiya family.`
` ......If you have any business, please say so at any time.`
` ......Then, if you will excuse me."`
`After hearing all that, there was nothing left to say.`
`{n}Genji‐san bowed deeply, and left down the hall...`
`And we entered the room.`
`...Even though Auntie Rosa still held all of the master keys herself, she began another thorough check of the inside of the parlor.`
`She opened the curtains, and checked again to make sure the windows were locked.`
`{n}As I watched, ......how should I say it, I felt like it didn't really matter anymore.`
`If I said anything unnecessary, it would turn into another fight.`
`{n}For a while, I gazed at her from the corridor, figured I had waited just about long enough, and entered the parlor behind her.`
`......If she can't trust anyone but the dead, she should just go around killing everyone with the gun she's got in her hand.`
`And then in the end, she'll realize that she herself was the wolf.`
`{n}...And then she can blast through the head of the final wolf, and the curtain will close on this insane murder theater...`
`As I thought that bitterly, I returned to the sofa where I had been encamped before,`
` and rudely rested both of my feet on the table...`
`......Or was about to, when I found something there and stopped my feet.`
`"........................`
` .........What is...this...?"`
`Right there, almost as though it was addressed to me, ...was a Western envelope.`
`It was that envelope from before, with the seal of the One‐winged Eagle.`
`{n}...And it was unopened.`
`W‐`
`.........wait wait wait wait...`
`...What is...this............?`
`When, who, put it in a place like this......?`
`I had been sitting here the whole time, until I went with everyone to check the corpses.`
`And there hadn't been anything.`
`...And when I returned,`
` it was...`
`here.`
`"......It's alright.`
` There was no problem with the locks on the windows.`
` This room is safe."`
`I heard Rosa muttering that...`
`......Wait wait wait wait.`
`{n}...Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait.`
`We had made sure this room was safe when we exited it.`
`{n}We had checked that the windows were all perfectly locked.`
`{n}...And we had locked it, come back, and the windows were still locked.`
`......Then, wait, who had put this letter here and how......`
`I opened the letter.`
`{n}Two pieces of stationery came out.`
`The first page......had a magic circle drawn on it, in something like blood.`
`If I asked Maria, she'd probably know what it meant.`
`And there was writing on the other page.`
`{e:070:― Are you making progress solving the riddle of the epitaph?`
`Very, very soon, you'll run flat out of time.`
`The ninth twilight will start very soon.}`
`......There was no mistake.`
`{n}...It was a letter...from {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`"...Uu?`
` ......Battler,`
` ......what is that?"`
`"Ah, ......right.`
` When I came here just now,`
` ...i‐it was just placed here."`
`"What happened, Maria?`
` .........Huh?!`
` Battler‐kun, that letter?!"`
`"W‐wait, err!`
` It was just placed here.`
` Why?!`
` Even though we properly checked to make sure this room was closed!!`
` Why?!`
` Why!!"`
`".................................`
` ......Maria, come here."`
`Auntie Rosa closed her eyes just a little, and after silently thinking something, told Maria to come.`
`Maria obeyed her mother's words.`
`As she did, something unbelievable happened.`
`Auntie Rosa pointed the barrel of that gun at me...`
`"Battler‐kun, I've concluded that you are a "wolf"."`
`"Wh‐.........why?!?!"`
`"When I came into the room just now, I saw that there was nothing at all on the table.`
` ...And I know that Maria did not approach that table.`
` ...It was for a short time.`
` But the only one who approached the table, and claimed to have found the letter, is you."`
`"How can you,`
` ............wait, tha‐that's all screwed up!!`
` Why would I put something like this here?!`
` Wait wait, I just found something suspicious and reported it, right?!`
` Why are you suspecting me?!"`
`"Because only you could set that letter there!!`
` That's right, this is all a charade!!`
` You pulled an envelope from your pocket, and then acted as though you had just found it.`
` To create the illusion that the witch entered a locked room, set down a letter, and left!!"`
`"...............You dumbass...`
` Are you thinking like that a‐......again...?`
` Because of something like that,`
` ......you're going to suspect me?!"`
`"Cut that out!!`
` My family has been killed!!`
` Why would {i:I} of all people take part in the culprit's scheme?!!"`
`"Yes.`
` Even under the assumption you could receive a large amount of money, I don't want to believe a demon exists who would sell their own parents."`
`"But, ...maybe he does.`
` No, that's a bad way to say it.`
` ......What if, in your eyes, Battler‐kun, Rudolf nii‐san and Kyrie‐san weren't your parents?"`
`"...Wh‐......whaaa?!?!`
` Think about what you're saying!!"`
`"Dad is Dad!!`
` Sure I'm not related to Kyrie‐san by blood, but she's like a big sister to me!!`
` Don't you dare say otherwise, you bastard!!"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Stoooppp iiiiit!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Stop saying "uu‐uu"!!"`
`"......I'm sorry, that was a bad way to say it.`
` Of course, Ushiromiya Battler‐kun might be Rudolf nii‐san's child!"`
`"......But, are you really Battler‐kun, the son of Rudolf nii‐san?!"`
`"What the hell are you talking about?!!`
` If I'm not Battler, then who else do I look like?!"`
`"All of us, including Rudolf nii‐san, reunited with you after a six‐year gap.`
` No one can prove that you really are Ushiromiya Battler, right?!"`
`"Maybe you aren't really Ushiromiya Battler, but someone who's snuck in, trying to skillfully steal the wealth of the Ushiromiya family!!`
` Can you clearly prove that you are Ushiromiya Battler?!`
` Right here, right now!!!"`
`"Cut it out, damn it!!`
` I am me!`
` Ushiromiya Battler!!`
` If we're going to doubt even that much, are you really Ushiromiya Rosa?!`
` I'm myself, no one else!!`
` Yeah, that's right, it's just as you say, the only one you can trust other than corpses is yourself!!!"`
`"If you're going to say that much, it's time I argued back!"`
`"The door to Aunt Natsuhi's room, where George‐aniki and the others died, was locked!`
` George‐aniki was holding the key to that room, right?!`
` And by now, the only one holding a master key is you!`
` Weren't you the only one who could have locked that room?!?!"`
`"My reasoning goes like this.`
` You're in contact with the real culprit,`
` and while I wasn't looking, you lent them one of the five master keys!!"`
`"I wouldn't do that!!`
` See, there are five of them here, right?!"`
`"As if that matters!!`
` You could have had them set it in a pre‐arranged spot and then collected it back!!`
` And weren't you the one who said it was suspicious whether there really are five master keys?!"`
`"So how are you saying that someone other than yourself set that letter there?!!`
` {i:As long as you can't prove that}, you are a wolf!!"`
`"Shut uuuuuup!!`
` Then why don't you show me some proof,`
` how do you say the culprit killed George‐aniki and the rest in that locked room?!`
` How did they lock it?!!"`
`"Absolutely and totally correct!`
` {p:1:Natsuhi's room was exactly the same, just like usual}!`
` {p:1:The door and the windows were locked from the inside}."`
`"{p:1:There were no frauds or tricks, no means of secret passage nor places in which to hide}!`
` {p:1:Natsuhi's own key was in George's pocket, and locked inside the room}.`
` {p:1:That leaves only the five master keys, and "Rosa" was holding all of them}!"`
`"{p:1:And while I'm at it, the parlor is the same}.`
` {p:1:The key to the parlor itself is sealed away in the servant room}.`
` {p:1:So unlocking it with anything but a master key is impossible}! {p:1:The locked‐room definition of the room is the same as always}!"`
`"Come onnnnn, there's only one suspect noooooooooow,`
` or are you still playing dumb, Ushiromiya Battleeee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeeer?!"`
`"Shut uuuuuuup!!`
` You keep silent as wellll{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}llllll!!!"`
`"You're the one who should keep silent, how do you say that letter was set there by someone other than you?!`
` As long as you can't prove that, you're a wolf!!"`
`"If I can be suspected, then you can be suspected, you try showing me some proof,`
` weren't you the first to enter the room and begin checking the windows?!"`
`"Then you anticipated that I'd return to where I'd been sitting before, and secretly placed the letter.`
` I can also suspect that this is your trap, can't I?!"`
`"Why would I use a trap like that?!!`
` If I was a wolf, I'd shoot you with this gun without question!!"`
`"That's no reason!!`
` Maybe, because you couldn't commit murder in front of Maria, you chose the roundabout way of setting a clever trap!!"`
`"All of the master keys are in your hands!`
` So this place and the room just a while ago, are all your doing, aren't they?!!`
` If you can talk your way out of this, then let me hear your excuse!!"`
`"That's right, you've been suspicious from the start!`
` Why is it that six of the adults in the family conference were killed, and you were the only exception?`
` Why were you the only one not in that chapel?!"`
`"There can only be one reason, you called Dad and the rest out there and killed them!!`
` Damn it, damn it,`
` that explains everything, doesn't it, don't fuck with me don't fuck with me,`
` stop saying things that don't make seeee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeense!!"`
`"Uuuuu!!`
` Stooppppp iiiiiiiiit!!`
` You mustn't fiiiight!!"`
`"Mama too, Battler too, stop iiiiiiiiiiit, stop iiiiiiiiiiiiit!!!`
` It's no one's fault!`
` It's not Battler's or Mama's fault!!`
` The witch did all of this!`
` She did it with magic!!`
` It's no one's faaaaaaaaaault!!`
` Uu‐uuuu!!"`
`Maria thrust herself in between me and Auntie Rosa, both of us incensed.`
`I was taken aback by Maria's crying voice and returned to my senses.`
`{n}...At that instant, I became filled with shame.`
`{n}Tears flowed from my eyes.`
`"......That's right...`
` ......It's all...`
`......the witch's fault, isn't it......!!`
` All this about keys and tricks and alibis......`
`all of it, all of it was stupid!!"`
`"Even though it's the work of the witch, we weren't even able to trust each other as fellow humans...!!`
` Right, Auntie Rosa? From the beginning, there wasn't a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} culprit, it was all the work of the witch."`
`"So there's no way you're the culprit,`
` and there's no way I'm the culprit, or Maria, or Genji‐san, or aaaaaanyone!!`
` Why has it come to this?!!"`
`"Why am I screaming with Auntie Rosa, ......who I loved?!`
` Why am I having this fight...`
`...with the kind aunt who I loved?!"`
`"Why, why does everyone have to suspect each other?!?!`
` I'm not going to doubt my auntie, I'm not going to doubt anyone,`
` it's all the work of the witch, it's all the work of {f:5:Beatrice},`
` it's all, all a crime that {f:5:Beatrice} committed with magic!!"`
`"{f:5:Beatriceeeeee}, please, show yourself here,`
` and confess to us that you did everything,`
` I've had enough already, I've had enough of doubting each other like this!!"`
`"So forgive us,`
` release us,`
` release us from this hell of suspecting each other until we see each other's deaths!!`
` Give me my kind relatives and cousins back!!`
` I hate it, I hate it, I hate it all!!`
` You definitely exist, you win!!"`
`"Show yourself, ooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oooohhh, {f:5:Beatriceeee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeeeee}!`
` {f:5:Beatriiiiiceee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eee}!!!"`
`".........Am I...............still...alive?"`
`Kinzo seemed to have fallen into a doze at some point.`
`He searched for his spectacles, and looked at the clock.`
`{n}......It was 10 p.m.`
`"...Her ritual, I wonder, how far has it progressed?`
` ............It must have progressed quite far by this time."`
`Kinzo lifted his heavy body from the chair, ......and approached the portrait of the witch that he had gazed at every day.`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Very soon, ......I will be able to be reunited with your smile.`
` ............It doesn't matter if I die!`
` If I could just see your smile once more, I would gladly give this life of mine!"`
`"So,`
` ...I beg youuuu, let me...`
`...meet with you one more tiiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiiiime...`
` And let me swear my love to you, let me apologize for my crimes, uuuoooooooooooo......"`
`"......But I won't let you escape!!`
` You are mine!!`
` From your hair to the tips of your toes, to the dirt under your nails, you are mine!!`
` Every fragment of your flesh is mine, even the broth of your corpse is mine!!"`
`"I won't let you escape, this time you won't spill from my hands!!`
` I'll make you mine for all eternity!!!`
` I will never let you escape a second time,`
` I will never let you escape a second time!!"`
`Kinzo howled in rage, then suddenly fell to his knees, ...as he shook and scraped at the wall...`
` ...In an instant, he had started sobbing.`
`"............uuuuuu, hic...,`
` that's wrong,`
` that's not what I wanted to sayyy, {f:5:Beatriceeeeee}..."`
`"Please,`
` ......let me meet you one more time...`
` Even if you only let me apologize......`
` Uuuuuuuuu, {f:5:Beatriceeeeee},`
` ...hic, ...hic...! Uwaaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}u{0}a{0}a{0}uauau...!!"`
`"You are beloved, yearned for...! I was wrong...!`
` If you would just smile, I wouldn't need anything else...`
` I made a mistake, I got it wrong,`
` ......I did something that cannot be taken back...!"`
`"In atonement, I have offered the whole remainder of my life...!!`
` In order to apologize to you, in order to atone for my sins,`
` .........I have...`
`...offered everything.........`
` ......Please, even if it is as I die..."`
`"............At least...`
`............let me...`
`say one word...`
`...of apology...y......`
` {f:5:Beatriceeeeeee}......`
` Uuuuuu, hic, uuuuuuuu, uuuuuuuuuuuuu!"`
`......As Kinzo shook and cried, behind his small back, a butterfly appeared out of nowhere, like a flake of gold leaf, and softly fell down...`
`...You fool, Kinzo.`
`{n}Do you think a woman exists who would fall for a man's tears.........?`
`Well, ......even if it wouldn't make a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} woman fall for you, ...it might for a woman who is not {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
`Kinzo.`
` Do you remember......?`
`{n}The board position of our chess game, which we never finished......?`
`Kinzo, as though he had suddenly remembered something, approached the chess set.`
` The game he had been playing with Nanjo until yesterday remained there still.`
`...He wiped the pieces from the chessboard with a wide sweeping motion, and began to line them up again one by one.`
` ...It was the setup for a game in progress.`
`".........That's right. Like this.`
` ............I advanced my queen.`
` ...That was a very spectacular move.`
` It might have been a little too intense for you.`
` .........I deliberated whether you would throw away your piece or not,`
` ......deliberated and deliberated............"`
`Kinzo waited, with the opposite seat empty.`
`......Surely, very soon, his opponent would appear there,`
` ......and he would be able to restart this game again...`
`...You fool, Kinzo.`
`You want to apologize?`
` You want to see my face again?`
` You want to make my smile an eternal thing?`
`Why can't you say a much, much simpler word?`
` Even though that is the single element of the world.........`
`At that time, Kinzo muttered.`
`{n}......A prayer?`
` An entreaty?`
`{n}.........It was probably best to just call it muttering.`
`"......I.........love you...`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice}..............."`
`They were pure words, like something an innocent child would say, without any evil intent...`
`...You really are a fool, Kinzo.`
`If you ever have the chance to do your life over again...`
`{n}...know that those words could never cause a woman to fall for you.`
`Yes, ...not without a miracle.`
`{n}So this.........`
`Just then.`
` .........Kinzo definitely heard a small knock, with a different tempo than those of the servants.........`
`".........Who is it?"`
`The woman beyond the door......didn't answer.`
`"......I'm asking who you are!!`
` Will you not answer?!!"`
`The woman beyond the door...`
`...didn't answer.`
`"Could it be...`
` ............Oooooh,`
` ......could it be......`
` B‐`
`......{f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice},`
` .........{f:5:Beatriceeeeeeeee}!!"`
`The woman beyond the door......answered.`
`On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive.`
