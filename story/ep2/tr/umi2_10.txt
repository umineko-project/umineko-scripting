`"Milady, please, calm yourself...!"`
`"We still don't know who the culprit is!`
` And {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is an important honored guest to the Master...!"`
`"So what?!!`
` If we grab her by the collar, she'll definitely confess!!`
` If we can look her in the eye, we'll know!!`
` I'll see through her!!`
` A witch?! {f:5:Beatrice}?!!`
` I'll expose her for who she is!!"`
`Jessica never stopped moving.`
`{n}Gohda and Kanon chased after her, doing their best to convince her, but Jessica never lent them an ear.`
`Eventually, the "Witch's VIP Room" came into view.`
`{n}This VIP room was always sealed and never used.`
`...No matter what kind of guest came, Kinzo wouldn't let them in this room.`
`......And yet, the servants were always made to clean this room, so that it could be used at any time.`
`So the servants had started calling this room the "Witch's VIP Room", after their other shapeless master.`
`Jessica also knew this.`
` And she couldn't stand that woman's arrogance in calling herself a witch, by staying in that room.`
`......The Golden Witch was just a fairy tale.`
` Come on, a witch?!`
` To Jessica, she was nothing more or less than the murderer who had brutally killed her parents!`
`Question her, make her give painful excuses, make her spit at the ground painfully, make her breathe painfully.`
`...No matter how hard she pretends to be a witch, I'll teach her that she's just a stinking, sweaty {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}!!`
`Jessica hit the door to the VIP room while yelling with all of her strength.`
`It definitely wasn't a knock.`
` ...That sound was the beating of her anger's hammer, whose message was clear: if the woman didn't open the door, she'd break it down.`
`"Open it, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` Come out!!`
` You hear me, right?!`
` Open up!!!"`
`There was no answer.`
` ...Jessica twisted the doorknob without any reservation, but she felt the resistance of the lock.`
`Jessica turned to the two servants, and spat out at them demandingly.`
`"The master key opens this, right?!`
` Open it!!"`
`"Milady...!`
` That would be horribly rude...!!"`
`Although Gohda was flustered, he still tried to somehow calm Jessica's anger.`
`......After hanging his head silently for a while, Kanon pulled a master key from his jacket pocket.`
`"Kanon‐san...!`
` Is that alright?!"`
`"......I am aware that this will be rude if she is there.`
` .........And in any case,`
` ...if {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama has nothing to do with this, she just has to explain herself so that we can believe her."`
`"Tha‐......that's right, exactly!!`
` Give it here!"`
`Jessica snatched the master key from Kanon's hand, and violently shoved it into the keyhole.`
`...Immediately, there was a light sound and she felt it unlock.`
`And without excusing herself, she flung open the door.`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` Where are you?!`
` Show yourself!!"`
`Jessica rudely barged into the room.`
`{n}...The witch wasn't anywhere to be seen.`
`"...Bitch!!`
` She's not here!!`
` Where the hell did she go?!"`
`".........She, she doesn't appear to be here, does she..."`
`Jessica, thinking that she might be hiding somewhere inside the room, peeked behind the curtains and under the bed, but she couldn't find anyone.`
`However, there definitely were signs that the bed had been used,`
` ......and although it's an odd way to say it, the atmosphere in the room had grown a little softer.`
`It wasn't the hard atmosphere of a place normally devoid of people, like the chapel.`
`{n}You could definitely tell that someone had spent the night in this room.`
`But she could not be seen.`
`In reality, neither Jessica nor Gohda had met {f:5:Beatrice} yet.`
`...They had only been told by those who had met her that she was the spitting image of the person in the portrait.`
`...So they were doubtful about what her face really looked like.`
`...However, Kanon alone had met her.`
` And he understood what kind of being that witch was, ......and what kind of character she had.`
`So he knew that if they were to force their way in here searching for her, she wouldn't let things go as they planned.`
`......She must be watching us bitterly flail about in vain from somewhere, sneering at us.`
` ......She's that kind of person.`
`Because he was looking at things that way, Kanon was the first to find it.`
` ...The other two were concentrating on finding the shape of a person, so they hadn't noticed.`
`Near a water jug on the side table, there was a single sheet of writing paper.`
` It was accompanied by a short message and a fountain pen which had probably been used to write it...`
`Kanon understood the witch.`
` The witch would definitely ridicule them, as they found the six corpses, forced their way in here in rage, and were unable to find her.`
`......Ridicule has no meaning unless it is communicated.`
`{n}So in other words, ...this was definitely...that...!`
`"......Milady.`
` .........There's something written here."`
`"Written, what?!"`
`Jessica quickly dashed over and violently stole the piece of paper.`
`......She probably wasn't trying to be violent.`
`{n}...She just couldn't control her strength now.`
`".........What...?!`
` She's, she's {i:mocking} me?!!"`
`As soon as she read the message, Jessica went into a wild rage, crumpled the paper up, and threw it.`
`Then, she grabbed a table lamp that was by the side of the bed and violently swung it around, mercilessly hitting the walls and furniture with it.`
`...The lightbulb shattered at once, and scattered its shards across the room.`
`"Milady, please calm yourself...!`
` You'll hurt yourself!!"`
`"Let go!!`
` Damn it, damn it!`
` Show yourself, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` How could you do that to Mom and Dad!!`
` Are you that damn scared of me?!`
` I'll kill you, I'll kill you!!`
` Come out so I can beat you to death!!!`
` I told you to let go of me, damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`This was written on the paper...`
`{e:070:―Did you think I'd waste my time waiting comfortably in this place for you to barge in here?`
` You're too wild to be suitable for this intellectual night.`
` What kind of faces must your parents have had after raising you to be such a hapless fool?`
` Yeah, I saw them, they had perfectly stupid faces just like you.`
` Now they are in Candyland with their bellies all full!}`
`......It sounded like something that witch would write...`
` ......It meant that she had predicted that one of the children who had lost their parents would come running in here.`
`...If she was hiding somewhere in this room, she would surely be rolling around with laughter...`
`The witch was that kind of person.`
`{n}...She sneered at people's misfortune, using it to stave off the boredom of a thousand years...!`
`"Hand it over...!`
` I am telling you that you will hurt yourself...!`
` .........nnnnn, ......nnnn!!"`
`"I said let go!!`
` Damn iiiiiit, damn iiiiiiit!!`
` ......au!"`
`Gohda grabbed the table lamp Jessica had been swinging around and took it from her.`
`...Because if she kept swinging it around, she might hit something and get injured.`
`...To Gohda's eyes, Jessica probably looked mad with rage, burning with the flames of anger.`
`......But Kanon's eyes saw it differently.`
`Those were probably...tears of sadness...hidden by rage...`
`Therefore.`
`When, at the moment the table lamp was taken from her,`
` Jessica dropped to the floor almost as if groveling, and started crying and scratching at the carpet...`
`......Gohda was surprised, but Kanon was not.`
`......Her way of crying by brandishing her anger had been stolen from her, ...so this was inevitable.`
`"Uuuuuuuuuuughhh, waaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaa!!`
` Mom......Dad......uwaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}auuu{0}u{0}u{0}uuuu!!"`
`...Considering that she was a daughter of the Ushiromiya main family, ...she was in a very shabby state.`
`......She scratched at the carpet with her fingernails, and even her feet writhed and scratched at it.`
`Jessica cried very, very hard.`
` ...Because if she didn't, her rage would start building up again, and swallow her up.`
`But over and over again, she remembered that letter's humiliating message...`
` ......What kind of faces must your parents have had after raising you to be such a hapless fool?`
`"They aren't stupid!!`
` Both Mom and Dad were smart!!`
` They weren't like me, they were really smart!!`
` They aren't stupid!`
` Take it back,`
` take it back!!"`
`Yeah, I saw them, they had perfectly stupid faces just like you.`
`{n}Now they are in Candyland with their bellies all full!!`
`"Ooooooooooooooohhh, damn iiiiiit!!`
` I'll kill her I'll kill her, I'll slice her stomach and make her meet the same end!!`
` Uuuuaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaa, waaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaa......!!!`
` Hic, *cough*cough*, *cough*cough*cough*!!!"`
`As Jessica cried and screamed, she triggered an asthma attack...`
` The servants watching over her ran up to her hurriedly and rubbed her back, but that only provoked Jessica's wrath...`
`"*cough*cough*!!`
` 'the hell!!`
` If you have the time to do that, search for that bitch!!`
` Find her and bring her to me!!"`
`"If you won't go, then I will!!`
` And I'll kill her with my own hands, I'll slice her stomach!!"`
`"*cough*cough*cough*cough*!!`
` *cough*, *cough*!!`
` Don't touch me!!!`
` Fucker...fucker, *cough*cough*!!`
` *cough*cough*!!"`
`Jessica got up unsteadily, and as her asthma continued, she went out into the hallway...`
`"Milady, your medicine, quickly...!`
` I will call Doctor Nanjo!"`
`"...............Gohda‐san.`
` .........Would you...leave this to me?"`
`Kanon had noticed.`
` .........Gohda, who was much older, ...probably couldn't feel the tears in Jessica's heart.`
`......Kanon, who had noticed that himself, had to support her.`
`"K‐Kanon‐san.`
` ............Is that alright...?"`
`".........I believe that Milady needs some time to cry for now.`
` ............After seeing her parents, when they were killed like that..."`
`".................................`
` ...You're right."`
`Gohda also understood.`
` ......And he also knew of the modest relationship that Jessica and Kanon shared.`
`So he understood everything, and left it to Kanon.`
`".........I understand.`
` ......I will go back to Rosa‐sama.`
` ...Please, take care of Milady."`
`"Yes.`
` ......Leave it to me."`
`Kanon's voice was frail, ......but he nodded forcefully.`
`{n}After looking at his eyes, Gohda also nodded forcefully.`
`...Gohda was a veteran with many years behind him.`
` He had seen a great number of people in his life.`
` ...So he knew of the vigorous sparkle that could be found in the eyes of those who had self‐control.`
`He had seen that clearly in Kanon's eyes.`
`{n}......Therefore, he would leave this to Kanon.`
`...Thinking about it, this may have been the first moment that Gohda had trusted Kanon and relied on him for a job...`
`It seemed Jessica was heading towards her room, ...leaning against the wall as she suffered from her asthma.`
`......Kanon followed after her wordlessly.`
`If she had asked for a hand, he would have jumped over and supported her.`
` ...But as long as Jessica didn't ask for that, he hid himself, watching over her from a distance where he could come to her rescue at any time.`
`......As Kanon remained in that spot where ten billion people would hope for someone else to be when their hearts felt like they would explode from sadness,`
` he silently watched Jessica's back...`
`Then, finally, she was crouching in front of the door to her own room.`
`......The asthma attack had stolen all of her strength.`
` And her thoughts had gotten hazy from the lack of oxygen, so that she could no longer stand up.`
`......But right now, Jessica wasn't thinking that she wanted someone to lend a hand.`
` Because she still hadn't been able to overcome the flames of anger.`
`...Because even if someone had offered her a hand with good intentions, right now, Jessica would start wanting to grab it and lacerate it.`
`...And she understood how unreasonable that would be.`
` ...Until she could overcome the flames of her anger, she definitely wouldn't ask for help.`
`Probably, Jessica no longer even had the willpower to call for help.`
`......But Kanon heard it.`
` ...He definitely heard it.`
`......Kanon definitely heard that voiceless call for help, which is shared by those from across the world who are grieving, and which, though they scream and scream, cannot be heard by anyone.`
`Kanon softly knelt by Jessica's side, and wordlessly offered her a shoulder.`
`......Even as Jessica kept coughing painfully, she accepted it,`
` .........unlocked her room, and entered...`
`"............This way.`
` ...............I'll prepare your medicine right away."`
`"..................*cough*cough*cough*...!`
` .........*co.........*cough*cough*cough*...!!"`
`Jessica had often said that when she let her asthma run its course, it hurt so badly that it felt like she would vomit her whole stomach.`
`Her face was pale, and her gaze wavered.`
`{n}And yet, the coughing continued...`
`......Even so, ...her sadness was probably even stronger...`
`After having her sit on the bed, Kanon took an inhaler from a cute basket on a side table by the bed, and handed it to her.`
`......Jessica sometimes forgot to walk around with her medicine.`
`When it seemed that this was the case, Kanon would take notice and secretly carry around the inhaler from the first‐aid kit in the servant room, but he hadn't done so today.`
`......He scolded himself, as though wondering how, after failing to bring it with him on a day like this, he could call himself furniture.`
`.........Then he remembered the day when he had spoken that word, and somehow betrayed Jessica's feelings, ...which jarred Kanon's heart,`
` ......but compared to Jessica's current sadness, he thought of that as a far more shameless emotion, and he suppressed it to the depths of his heart...`
`".........haah.........haah...`
` .....................haah..."`
`When she inhaled her medicine, Jessica's wild breathing calmed down bit by bit, ...and she was finally able to regain her composure.`
`.........But the strength and willpower she had lost wouldn't allow her to rise up from the bed.`
`".....................Are you alright?`
` ......Milady."`
`"............I'm...`
`......alright...`
` .........I'm all messed up over Mom and Dad,`
` .........but,`
` ......after I cry a little longer,`
` .........I'll be alright............"`
`"........................"`
`Kanon regretted misspeaking.`
`......He had said "Are you alright", to her?`
`{n}...Was he really unable to notice the pain in her heart?`
`............This was why he was, ultimately, mere furniture.`
`{n}This was why he couldn't become human...`
`"..................I will be in the corridor.`
` ...If you need anything, please call me immediately."`
`Kanon understood that she still needed some time to cry alone.`
`He told her to call him at any time, bowed, and made to leave the room.`
`"......ah, ..............."`
`"......Is there something?"`
`Jessica had spoken as though she wanted him to stop, so Kanon had stopped.`
`.........If she asks it, I'll do anything to help her.`
`...If it could heal the pain in her heart, right now, I would even become a cane or a chair.`
`.........If by doing that, ......I can repair the pain in her heart I gave her that day...`
`".........................................."`
`...For a while, Jessica stared into Kanon's eyes.`
`{n}......As though, despite stopping him, she had nothing to say.`
`"................................."`
`"..........................."`
`For a while, neither spoke.`
` ............Jessica broke that silence.`
` ...With a small voice.`
`".........Sorry.`
` .........It's nothing.`
` ...............Could you tell Auntie Rosa that I want to be alone for a while...?"`
`"I won't...let you be alone."`
`"........................huh..."`
`"I won't let you...be alone.`
` ..................So, I will be in the corridor.`
` ...At any time,`
` ......call me."`
`For just an instant, it looked like some kind of hope flew to Jessica's eyes.`
`...But it was very faint, ...and disappeared like the first snow does on the surface of a river.`
`"......Thanks.`
` ..................For just a while, let me cry alone..."`
`"............Yes.`
` ...............Excuse me."`
`Kanon bowed once again, and closed the door...`
`.........He thought he had said something to give her some courage.`
`{n}............But for some reason, it felt like that had actually hurt her.`
`...Why?`
` .........He didn't know.`
`{n}......Surely, that was because...`
`...............he was furniture.`
`So even now, ...he couldn't grasp human sadness.`
`As Kanon repeatedly questioned himself, he walked down the corridor.`
` .........He felt like the window at the end was coolly calling to him.`
`"..............................`
` ......In the end, .........am I nothing more than furniture after all......?"`
`It was still pouring outside—a dark, gray world.`
`...Even on days like this, Shannon would surely look at the ocean and know it was blue.`
`......But to my eyes, even if it cleared up, I would only see gray...`
`As long as I cannot tell the blueness of the ocean,`
` ......I am nothing but furniture imitating a person.........`
`".....................You really don't understand a woman's heart.`
` ...In times like that, you should silently remain by her side.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*, that's why you're furniture."`
`"Y‐............you―"`
`There shouldn't have been a trace of anyone in this corridor.`
`{n}It had been empty and cold.`
`{n}.........But those scoffing words approached Kanon from behind.`
`When he turned around, ......he saw that witch.`
`{n}That witch, who hadn't shown herself when Jessica had searched for her with a rage bordering on madness—who had left that sneering letter to toy with her...!`
`"There are three ways to hurt a woman.`
` ...Let me teach them, just for you.`
` One is to hurt them with a knife.`
` Another is to hurt them in their heart."`
`"...And the last one is the most difficult, and the most effective way of hurting them.`
` And yet it can hurt them without you even realizing it.`
` Do you know what it is...?"`
`"How, ......how could I know, I don't even want to know!!"`
`"It is to betray their hopes.`
` ......No living being is more of a dreamer than a woman!`
` They dream by themselves, and hurt by themselves.`
` ......A distant man like you hurts women the most!`
` You couldn't understand.`
` You don't have a clue how much you have injured Jessica."`
`"......Because you're furniture!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"I, I have no intention of going along with your nonsense!`
` ......Did you appear only to sneer at me?!!"`
`"Don't be so full of yourself, furniture.`
` You aren't worth sneering at!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Still, even though you may not be worth it alone, if the two of you are gathered, that's more than enough.`
` ......I never get tired of the pleasure that comes from laughing at the fate of a young couple."`
`"What did you say...`
` .........Y‐`
`...you aren't thinking...`
` ......Not Milady......"`
`"I need "two who are close" as sacrifices for the second twilight.`
` ...The two of you truly are convenient...!!"`
`"W‐......wait...!`
` Don't misunderstand......!`
` Milady and I...`
`...don't have that kind of relationship...!`
` We can't become the sacrifices for the second twilight!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` That's why you hurt Jessica.`
` That's why you cannot become human...!!"`
`"Very well, then, if you won't admit that you have feelings for Jessica, I can accept that.`
` ......But I'll kill Jessica!!"`
`"Why?!"`
`"You idiot!!`
` Isn't it obvious?!!"`
`"{i:It'll be fun to kill her and see the pained look on your face, why else}?!!"`
`"Following the rules of the ritual, I will arbitrarily select thirteen people as sacrifices.`
` However, there's no rule saying that I can't kill any more."`
`"...If I think it's fun, I can kill any number of people!!`
` So I will kill!!`
` {i:Make me laugh as hard as I can}, alright furrrrnituuuure, Kanonnnnnnnn?!?!"`
`At that time, Kanon definitely heard Jessica's scream.`
`The instant he blinked and looked down the corridor, the witch, who had been there making a perfectly ordinary face until a second ago, had disappeared.`
`...Right now, it was just him, standing alone in the corridor.`
`......And the person he wanted to protect was asking for help, and was right over there.`
`It was obvious what he should do.`
`{n}It wasn't logical.`
` It was an electric reaction.`
`{n}Without a trace of hesitation or idle thoughts.`
`...The person he wanted to protect was there, and asking for help.`
` .........So, in that moment, he genuinely felt that he wanted to be the person who was there with her.`
`When he flew into Jessica's room, his eyes latched on to a bizarre scene.`
`The room was a fantastical world, where a blizzard of golden powder danced, almost as though gold leaf had been scattered inside a snow globe.`
`.........No, that's not it.`
`{n}I've seen this spectacle before.`
`{n}This isn't gold leaf.`
`......It's countless gold butterflies—{f:5:Beatrice}'s minions!!`
`Jessica was surrounded by countless butterflies, and was waving her hands around, trying frantically to bat them away.`
`"Milady!!!"`
`"Ka‐Kanon‐kun......`
` H‐help...............`
` ...*cough*cough*cough*cough*!!"`
`Kanon rushed towards Jessica, and violently brushed the group of butterflies away.`
`...The butterflies, beautiful yet filthy, surrounded Jessica's face, trying to crawl in through her mouth and nose.`
`Jessica gagged violently.`
`...Almost as though the butterflies were triggering her asthma attack, sneering at her.`
`Indeed, when Kanon ran towards Jessica as she choked, the butterflies stopped attacking her, and this time, they began to elegantly dance a rondo around the two.`
`".........Kanon‐kun...... Kanon‐kun........."`
`"...It's alright.`
` ............While there's still life in my eyes,`
` ......I won't let anyone lay a finger on you."`
`".........Show yourself, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` Are you satisfied now?!!"`
`As he guarded Jessica, in pain and using her inhaler, Kanon yelled into the empty air.`
`......When he did, the empty air definitely laughed back, satisfied.`
`...Then, she showed herself.`
`{n}It wasn't in response to Kanon's demand.`
`It was obviously because appearing and sneering humiliated them even more, and was more fun!`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*hahahahaha!!`
` Now everything follows the plot.`
` Now you are carp on the chopping board."`
`"No, since the two of you are together, should I call it {c:86EF9C:duck with green onions}?`
` Hahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"Y‐......you,`
` ......B‐{f:5:Beatrice}...!!"`
`"Please, stand back.`
` ......I'll protect you, Milady...!"`
`"It's essential that the witch appears when the princess and the knight are together.`
` ......Come now, won't you show me how much power Kinzo's furniture holds?"`
`She snapped her fingers and there was a piercing sound.`
`When she did, a blizzard of gold butterflies started up, and they began to form a small mountain as they whirled around in a circle.`
`...Just like how a cold, wintry wind swirls and creates a mountain of leaves.`
`From that mound of gold, a hand sprouted, ...and it appeared, ......as though a resident of the world below was crawling out.`
`"Wh‐.........what is this......?`
` What's going on......?!"`
`Jessica couldn't comprehend what she was seeing right now, and her mouth kept flapping open and closed...`
`It was a literal attempt to take in and digest knowledge—to understand the incomprehensible.`
`That which was crawling up......was probably an attendant serving the witch.`
`It appeared to be wearing a uniform following the pattern of those who serve.`
`......But its face was different.`
` It was...strange‐looking...`
`......It was covered with pitch‐black hair, ...it breathed rotten breath, and its eyes were filled with the same strange subterranean glow as lava.`
`...And.........the symbol of those who are not human—a pair of horns...`
` It was the figure of a goat‐faced attendant who served the witch......`
`"...........................!!!!!"`
`Jessica could no longer decide what to say.`
`...All this happening in front of her couldn't be explained with this world's common sense, and she couldn't do anything except open and close her mouth.`
`......Jessica hadn't noticed.`
` ...That this island had already been cut off from the rules of this world.`
`But even so, she could understand.`
` ......That this goat attendant was the witch's familiar, ......and it was after her life.`
`And it seemed that the witch had already ordered that.`
`{n}And she faced Kanon with an expectant gaze.`
`......She faced him with a provocative gaze filled with expectation, as though asking him how he planned to protect this maiden!`
`The attendant had looked especially like a beast when it had been crawling up, but in its composure,`
` you could see that it had more than enough dignity to be worthy of serving the Golden Witch.`
`......And you could tell that it was overflowing with the joy of furniture wanting to meet its master's expectations.`
`".........Why don't you show me?`
` The power of Kinzo's furniture!"`
`"Don't get it wrong again... Understand?`
` ......Don't forget that you're furniture...`
` If you continue acting like a human even now, this won't be settled by your death alone.`
` Kukikiki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}kikiki!"`
`The goat attendant made a gesture that seemed to be a silent bow.`
`{n}Was that in response to its master, ...or was it offered to the opposing Kanon?`
`Then, on the attendant's hand, ......a blade of wicked malice appeared......`
`".........Wh‐`
`............what is...`
`......that............"`
`Jessica had been unable to understand what was happening in front of her for a while now.`
`......All she understood......was that this thing was gleaming for the purpose of threatening her own life.`
`And right now, that was enough.`
`Kanon spoke quietly to Jessica, who was hiding behind his back.`
`".........Milady.`
` ...Please stay back, against the wall.`
` ...Never let your back leave the wall."`
`"Wha......?!"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` The maiden should obediently hide behind the great knight's back.`
` Relish to the full the pleasure of having a man protect your own life.`
` ......Come!`
` Kanon, show me your blade!!"`
`"................................."`
`"......Beautiful.`
` ...At least when it comes to giving birth to furniture, Kinzo might reach up to my feet."`
`"...Something like this......can't even be used to trim the roses."`
`"...............K‐.........Kanon‐kun...`
` ...............What is........."`
`".........I didn't want...to show you."`
`"So you had the courage to draw your blade.`
` .........How does it feel to have exposed the fact that you are a subhuman being in front of the girl you have feelings for?"`
`"........................Shut up."`
`"......Hmph.`
` ......So you feign composure even though you're really burning with wrath?`
` ...I see, they say that truly hot flames burn a cool blue.`
` Is that how you are now?"`
`"There's no way I can kill you with my powers.`
` ......You are the moon.`
` There's no way I can smash the moon by throwing a rock.`
` ......However, in order to manifest yourself, you had to reflect your image on the surface of the water."`
`"If you throw a rock at the surface of the water, you might be able to disturb the moon for some time.`
` ...But that doesn't mean the moon has been smashed.`
` So."`
`"......Until this life of mine is over,`
` ......I'll keep on striking your reflection......!"`
`"I like it, Kanon!!`
` Begin, furniture!!"`
`"............Hoh.`
` ...............A beautiful trail."`
`The witch's words of admiration broke the silence, and for just an instant, broke Jessica's paralysis.`
`"..............................`
` Am,`
` ......am I...`
`...dreaming.........?"`
`"............Come,`
` furniture of the witch.`
` .........I'll beat you down to the hell you came from."`
`"................................."`
`A strand of red remained on Kanon's cheek.`
`{n}...The witch saw this and grinned broadly...`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` ......You may mutter excuses about not being on your game if you wish?"`
`"........................"`
`"K‐......Kanon‐kun, ............stay strong...!"`
`".........It's alright.`
` .........I...won't die yet."`
`The trail drawn by the goat attendant's blade......drew a large arc in empty space.`
`...Kanon...wasn't there.`
`{n}......He was behind it.`
`".........Back whither you came, and await your master.`
` ......Die."`
`If this battle of drawing sparkling trails was chess...`
`{n}...then Kanon coming from behind was check.`
`And press, and press, and press, and press.`
`{n}And mate in seven...!`
`......Had the goat attendant not even been given the right to go into death throes?`
`......As its knees buckled and it fell over, it crumbled softly into a bunch of gold butterflies...`
`So there was no sound of it hitting the ground.`
` Even those who couldn't understand this battle...could definitely at least realize that Kanon had been magnificent.`
`"......Hmph.`
` So it couldn't win against one handmade.`
` ...It seems that you aren't so pathetic."`
`"You're next, .........{f:5:Beatriceeeeeeeee}!!"`
`Kanon's blade sliced diagonally through the witch's form like a hot knife through butter, and in that instant, she burst into gold and scattered.`
`......She scattered into several thousand gold butterflies, and for just an instant, the room was filled with the color of twilight.`
`...It was just as Kanon himself had said.`
` Attempting to slice {f:5:Beatrice} was just the same as slicing the surface of the water where the moon was reflected.`
`...The witch's form was there, with an ordinary expression on her face, as though she had been there the whole time, ...behind Kanon.`
`"Hahahahahahaha...!!`
` It was quite an interesting show.`
` In deference to that, I was going to let you get away, but now your rudeness has caused me to change my mind..."`
`"Don't lie!`
` I won't let you kill Milady!!`
` ......Even if that's impossible, ......I won't let you kill her before me!"`
`"You can't even do that much.`
` Speak not, furniture.`
` Be silent, furniture.`
` Know your place, furniture!!"`
`"K‐.........Kanon‐kun isn't furniture...!"`
`"......Hoh.`
` ...And why do you say that?"`
`"I don't need a reason.`
` ......Kanon‐kun is Kanon‐kun."`
`"No, his real name is different, ......but a name doesn't make him furniture!`
` Kanon‐kun has his own way of living.`
` That's a very noble thing, and it's up to him to decide."`
`"......Saying he can't have an opinion because he's furniture, or can't have his own life because he's furniture......that's all just crap!!"`
`"Milady... You mustn't provoke her."`
`"No, I'm gonna say this clearly.`
` .........Kanon‐kun isn't furniture.`
` He's human.`
` ......Why?"`
`"Kanon‐kun rushed to save me of his own will.`
` And he stood in the path of you, a fearsome witch.`
` Even though he had many chances to just abandon me, he didn't."`
`".........Self‐sacrifice is part of the noble spirit that only humans have!!`
` So Kanon‐kun is human!!`
` So take it back!`
` Don't ever call Kanon‐kun furniture again!!"`
`".........Mila...dy........."`
`"Hmph.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` ...Kuhahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha.`
` Wahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"Don't speak, human!!`
` Let us end this quickly; after all, this is only the second twilight.`
` Now, I will sacrifice "the two who are close", who accept each other's dignity."`
`"Come, arise, forgive the sin, one of the seven stakes of Purgatory, lust!!!"`
`The witch summoned her own furniture with a mixture of laughter and anger on her face.`
`"......Asmodeus the Lustful.`
` Right here."`
`"I've had enough of this farce.`
` Quickly, execute the second twilight.`
` ......Do not permit me to blink thrice."`
`"......As you command."`
`"A‐......another weirdo's shown up......"`
`"...........................kh..."`
`It took Kanon less than an instant to understand.`
` ......That goat‐face from a second ago had been nothing more than a pawn to the witch.`
`However, there was a marked difference in the value of this piece, of this furniture that had been newly summoned.`
`"......How lucky am I, to be granted such gorgeous prey.`
` .........*giggle*giggle*giggle*, you scared?`
` How cuuute.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"............Come,`
` furniture of the witch...`
` I won't be killed by you...!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*!`
` You're acting pretty smart for a slowpoke who can't even follow my moves."`
`"......Here I come...`
` ......Hey hey, where do you want it?`
` Where do you want me to pierce you?`
` Answer me, cutie boy.`
` Wherever you want it, I'll run you through hard...!!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*, come on, answer me, cutie...!"`
`"D‐...don't call me cute!!!"`
`"Kyahahahahaha!!`
` Here I come, slowpoke!!`
` Come on, try to follow me, you blind idiot!!`
` Kyaahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"Ugnhh......!!"`
`"............Mi‐......Milady........."`
`"Heh, .........I couldn't follow it with my eyes...`
` But my guess...was spot on.........`
` Serves you...right............"`
`Kanon's back had been the target.`
`{n}...But Jessica had predicted it.`
`She had predicted that the sneering witch's target would be the complete opposite of fair and honest—his back.`
`But she had no way to block it.`
`{n}...She had no aspirations to martyrdom.`
`{n}She simply thought that there was no way other than this to protect Kanon's back.`
`............So, she could do nothing but block it with her own back.`
`The furniture of the witch, which had changed its form into a demon's stake, was stuck deep into Jessica's back.`
` ...It was an obviously fatal wound that reached as far as her lungs.`
`When she saw this, the witch let out a loud, evil laugh.`
`Because it had hit {i:where the witch had predicted}.`
`{n}...Everything, everything was as the witch had predicted!`
`"What's wrong Kanonnn...?`
` I thought "Milady Jessica" wasn't going to be killed before you??"`
`"Kukikikikiki, yes, yes, that's it, that's it, that face, that look on your face is what I wanted to see!!`
` Kikiki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}kikiki!!`
` This has been fun, more than enough of it!!`
` Enough now, die, die, make me laugh!!"`
`"Come, arise, forgive the sin,`
` one of the seven stakes of Purgatory,`
` wrath!!"`
`"......Satan the Wrathful.`
` Right here."`
`"The prey is yours.`
` Eat him right now, and close the curtain on his stage."`
`"......If you were a human, I'd say it's time for you to step down, but since you're furniture, maybe I should say it's time for the stage manager to carry you behind the stage!"`
`"..................I am not......furniture anymore.`
` I won't......doubt that again!"`
`"......*giggle*giggle*, ohh?`
` You're gonna be killed by me again?"`
`"Your chest, ......it's so warm, and it feels so good to stick myself in there, you know...?`
` Come on, let me have another taste...`
` Make me feel real good with that hot, hot, fresh blood in that warm chest of yours..."`
`"...Kyahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!"`
`"Ghh......!!"`
`There was no way to block it.`
`The sound of a woodpecker filled the entire room,`
` ...and before he could blink,`
` ......it was already right in the center of his chest...`
`When you take a piece in chess, it's impossible by the rules for your opponent's piece to defend.`
`So this was an obvious result, and one even specified by the rules.`
`Kanon landed on his knees...`
` And he apologized.`
`......Not to the witch.`
` ...And not to "Milady".`
`.........He apologized...to Jessica.`
`"...Sorry............`
` ......I couldn't......protect you............"`
`".........Don't worry about it......`
` ......You were really...cool......"`
`Kanon finally fell over.`
` ......He landed next to Jessica, and the two lay there like Gemini.`
`"......You know, Kanon‐kun,`
` .........you aren't...furniture anymore..."`
`"...Yes......`
` .........I was...`
`...too late...`
`...in realizing that......"`
`"I wanted to ask you...`
`.........what your real name was..."`
`"...My...`
`......real name is...`
`............`
`......ah...`
`.........aaaaaaaaah...ah..."`
`In his last moments, Kanon wanted to tell her his real name.`
` ...But...Jessica had already fallen into a sleep from which she would never wake......`
`So, Kanon's real name, which he had protected until today,`
` .........in the end,`
` ...he couldn't......tell it to Jessica...`
`".........I...`
`............became...`
`.........hu...ma........."`
`Those were...the last words Kanon left behind.`
`"Wahahahahahahahahaha, kukikaka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}kakaka!!`
` Don't make me laugh, furniture!!"`
`"Even after a hundred years, furniture is furniture!`
` Have you ever heard of an idiot who'll dig a grave for furniture when they throw it away?`
` You smash furniture to pieces and make firewood, so all that's left is ashes!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle, that's how it is, no tombstone can be carved for furniture!`
` ......It seems you believe that when you die, you cannot receive any more humiliation, but that's naive, you see...?`
` I'll teach you......what it really means to disgrace the dead.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!!"`
`After taking a puff from her pipe, the witch breathed the smoke at Kanon's corpse...`
`......When she did, Kanon's corpse softly floated up into the air, ...and disappeared as though it had been eaten by a mouth in empty space.`
`The witch played dirty until the very end.`
` ......The two who had understood one another in their last moments—she would not even permit their corpses to be close...`
`If someone had been watching, they would probably mourn that this was indeed a disgrace to the dead.`
`...However, {f:5:Beatrice} was far, far crueler...`
`{n}......That would become immediately apparent...`
