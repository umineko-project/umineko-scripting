`"Where are you, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` Show yourself!!`
` {f:5:Beatriceee}!!"`
`Rosa finally arrived at the chapel.`
` She pointed her gun around her, screaming the witch's name, but there was no way there would be an answer.`
`After grimacing slightly, she noisily approached the table where her siblings' corpses were still exposed, and stretched out her arm towards the gold ingots.`
`They were very heavy, but Rosa paid that no regard.`
`{n}She wrapped one of them up in a blanket, and slung it over her shoulder.`
`"At least...just this one......`
` Just this should be worth more than ten million..."`
`Rosa did not part with her gun either, carrying the gold in addition to it.`
`{n}...Her shoulders were screaming, but Rosa didn't care.`
`"......Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` It will happen very soon.`
` ......Very soon, the door to the Golden Land...will open."`
`"Stop laughing with that creepy voice!!`
` Where is {f:5:Beatrice}?!`
` Yes, I know it, she's around here somewhere, isn't she?!`
` You know, right?!`
` Where?!"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` I dooon't knowww.`
` Even if you don't search for her, you can meet her in the Golden Land.`
` ...Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi,`
` ouch."`
`"Stop that laugh!!`
` ......Aaah, it almost makes {i:me} want to laugh!!`
` That's right, that was definitely a witch, definitely a witch!!`
` I didn't understand, I thought it was a human calling herself a witch, I was wrong!!!"`
`"...It really was a witch!!`
` I won't be fooled by a thing like that!!`
` You're there, aren't you?!`
` Come out, show yourself!!`
` {f:5:Beatriceeee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeeee}!!!"`
`"I told you, she'll appear very soon.`
` The door to the Golden Land will be opened.`
` ......Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi..."`
`"............Of course.`
` That's what I should have done!`
` I don't care, I shall throw away the rook!`
` You, woman, are the king, who can't even be reached without the resolve to lose everything one has.`
` I'll corner you, {f:5:Beatriceeee}.`
` Hihahahahahahahahahaha!"`
`"At least call me a queen.`
` Hoh, what a brilliant move.`
` Tenacity is in your, ...no, in the Ushiromiyas' blood."`
`"......How pleasant!`
` Truly an elegant night.`
` Ku‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha...!!"`
`".........My lord; {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` It will soon be time for the banquet."`
`"Already?`
` ......That's fast.`
` Every night I pass with you goes by fast;`
` the moon falls like an apple, and the sun rises like a small fish leaping out of the river."`
`"Shall we go, it is time.`
` ......Stand, Battler.`
` It is the beginning of the banquet to celebrate my revival."`
`"I'll introduce you as my new furniture, ...no, as my toy.`
` To the dignitaries among witches."`
`The witch was relaxing elegantly, her feet thrown out from the sofa and sitting on top of a footrest.`
`...However, the footrest wasn't a part of the sofa, ......it was a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` Which was down on all fours......`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, your silk dress."`
`"You are the guest of honor, but I am the host.`
` I will go out first.`
` It would have been nice if Shannon were here to help dress you, but, unfortunately, it seems that she no longer remains."`
`"......She's never around when I want to use her.`
` Completely useless.`
` .........However, you did well to remain here.`
` ...I'm happy, my friend."`
`"......I am grateful for your words."`
`"Good.`
` Wait downstairs, you two.`
` Genji, good work, set the dress down over there."`
`"......Certainly.`
` .........Well then, my lord."`
`"We will go first.`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice}, I will see you later."`
`"Indeed."`
`Kinzo and Genji left the study.`
`{n}After that, only the witch and the dress and the furniture remained.`
`".........Do you know why I am not embarrassed to show myself to you naked...?"`
`"..........................."`
`"It's because you are furniture.`
` Furrrrniture.`
` Understand?`
` Furniture, just furrrrniture!"`
`"Who would feel shame at exposing their body to furniture?`
` So there is no reason for me to feel shame because of you.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The witch stood up, and removed her jacket just at the shoulders.`
`{n}......The jacket slumped down at the back.`
`When the furniture respectfully approached to pick up her clothing, the witch gave it a small kick and it fell over.`
`...The furniture was afraid of what misconduct it had shown...`
`"Do you, as furniture, plan to force me to unbutton myself?"`
`"......Stand.`
` And undo the buttons.`
` ...One by one, carefully.`
` Quickly.`
` Beautifully.`
` With no mistakes.`
` The guests are being kept waiting, change my clothes quickly."`
`"..................Yes..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, kakakaka, hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!!`
` Undo them carefully.`
` Those buttons are each worth more than one of your eyeballs.`
` ...If you accidentally tear one off, I'll sew on an eyeball of yours in its place...`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`The entrance hall was bustling with a large number of figures.`
`{n}And it was sparkling gold with the gold butterflies flying around.`
`The gentlemen in suits and tuxedos and the ladies in dresses looked like they were having a great number of friendly chats.`
` At a glance, it might have looked like a fabulous medieval ball.`
`But they all had one thing in common, and that thing was exceedingly bizarre.`
`......Because all of them...had goat heads.`
`It was impossible to tell whether it was a goat mask masquerade,`
` .........or whether they really had goat heads.`
`...The latter was a ridiculous notion, but in this bizarre world, there was serious doubt about which was true...`
`Kinzo was amongst those goat nobles, greeting them.`
`Every one of them seemed to be an honored guest, and Kinzo greeted them more respectfully than could ever have been imagined from his normal demeanor.`
`At that time, Genji's voice rang out through the hall.`
`{n}It was a voice calling for silence.`
`{n}That voice stopped the voices of idle chatter, and everyone turned to face Genji.`
`".........Tonight marks the entrance of our Golden Witch, who has achieved her revival,`
` the Lady {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I ask you all to join me in welcoming her with your applause."`
`When Genji began to applaud, it quickly spread through the guests, and became thunderous applause.`
`And.........the Golden Witch appeared at the top of the large staircase...`
`She gracefully waved her hand as she slowly descended the staircase...with her preferred furniture in tow...`
`The goat nobles offered unanimous words of celebration in some long‐forgotten language.`
`And those with whom she was closely acquainted embraced her, filled with joy at their reunion.`
`As the witch offered greetings of reunion, ...the witch's furniture followed behind her the whole time.`
`.........There was a chain around its neck.`
`{n}This was gripped in the witch's hand, like it was a trained dog.`
`The chain wasn't there to restrain it.`
`{n}...The only purpose of the restraining device was to injure the furniture's dignity...`
`It wasn't permitted to wear anything else on its body.`
`One of the young woman goats, mixed in with the goat nobles,`
` softly removed her goat mask as the furniture passed in front of her, and spoke with eyes that had no light in them.`
`That face...looked like it belonged to a long‐haired young girl...`
`"...............How pitiful."`
`"Ohh, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` Welcome.`
` Do you like my furniture?"`
`".........Good taste."`
`After saying only that, the witch called {f:5:Bernkastel} once again put on her goat mask,`
` and was swallowed up in the shadows of the other tall goats...`
`"Ahahahahahahaha...`
` Sore loser.`
` She's irritated."`
`"You're right.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The young women goats giggled, and the witch once again let out a high‐pitched laugh.`
`"Thank you for gathering here for my sake tonight!!`
` Why don't we enjoy to the fullest this "banquet of the witch", where old friends have gathered from past and present, east and west...!"`
`"Come, we will eat all night,`
` drink all night,`
` slurp all night,`
` and chew to bits all night as we enjoy ourselves!!`
` Look at the clock, it shows the time when the ending hour and the beginning hour melt together... ...Come!!`
` Let us begin the banquet of the witch!!!"`
`When the witch proclaimed the beginning of the banquet, the large clock pointed to 24:00, and the sound of a bell began to ring out loudly...`
`"Come...... Now is the time!!`
` Open the golden door............!!!"`
`All at once, the butterflies leafed in gold flew all around the inside of the room.`
`Amidst the golden storm and the brilliant gold‐colored light, the cross‐section joining this world and a different world......was cut open......`
`Amidst the goats' delighted voices, the mansion of the human world and the mansion of those not human overlapped,`
` ......and, in the form of golden butterflies, all those folk who praised the resurrection of the Golden Witch...`
`...poured out of the depths of hell...`
`It was...a golden...tornado.`
`{n}...A rondo of golden demons.`
`Come, tonight we will put aside rank.`
`Throw open the wine cellar,`
` drop the snake's head into the liquor pot,`
` throw cows and chickens into the furnace alive,`
` drink and eat and sing and dance,`
` sneer and kill and desecrate and degrade!!`
`"Aaaaaahh, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` Take me to the Golden Land now!`
` To the Golden Laaaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaaand!!!`
` Oooo{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}ooohhh{0}h{0}hhhhh, aaaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaaahhh!!!"`
`The goat nobles were suddenly crushing in around Kinzo.`
`...Almost like they were kids demanding the autograph of some famous movie star.`
`There were two differences.`
` First, they were witches, not kids.`
` And second, what the witches demanded were not autographs.`
`Kinzo began to drown in the sea of goat nobles.`
`{n}Only Kinzo's laughing voice echoed throughout the area.`
`It was a grand mixture of laughter and his death throes.`
`{n}And Kinzo became wine and meat and bread.`
`An aroma if slurped, a rich taste if gnawed, and pleasant to tear to bits!`
`The voice of his death throes lingered on sweetly,`
` and adorned with melted chocolate and silver dragées, it would make a wonderful dessert!`
`If you took the bones home, you could also use them for a soup,`
` and the remains could even become toys for the children to play with,`
` and they could also become good tools for fortune‐telling that always gave misfortune!`
`That entire scene, ......was watched by the piece of furniture.`
`{n}It was all fantastical.`
` ...It was all demonic.`
`...Was the quaking of its heart, which should have been paralyzed, ...proof that it could still feel fear?`
`Just then, its knees buckled, and the furniture's body tumbled onto the center of the carpet.`
`Because the witch had kicked those knees from behind.`
`"Kneel and show your respect.`
` Rub your forehead against the carpet and show how vulgar you are.`
` Join your hands behind your back and swear that you will offer all your flesh and blood to me."`
`"..................u............ah........."`
`The piece of furniture let out a painful voice.`
`...Fear is the most primal emotion {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s have.`
`{n}...Was that emotion reviving his sense of self, which should already have been killed?`
`".........Hmph.`
` So, you are still far from being appropriate for my furniture."`
`"Good!`
` I will carefully make you into the kind of furniture I like, the kind appropriate only for me.`
` ...I suppose the best you can do for now is simply entertaining the guests!"`
`The goat nobles were surrounding the cowering furniture...`
`{n}It seemed that their blazing, blood‐red eyes couldn't hide their ecstasy at this new young food that they had been given.`
`And from their mouths, from which protruded countless ugly teeth, saliva,`
` ...or maybe the traces of meat and wine that they had just eaten, dribbled down...`
`".........e............eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!!"`
`As the piece of furniture let out a wild scream, it retreated, still sitting on its backside.`
`...But the circle of goat nobles was closing in...`
`And the piece of furniture looked at the witch's face.`
` ...It stared at her face one final time, believing that because it had submitted to the witch, she would show it some mercy.`
`But there was nothing but scorn on the witch's face, and she wasn't even facing it anymore.`
`The witch went off to greet an honored guest with whom she had crossed gazes...`
`The goat nobles looked down upon the furniture.`
`They were, in fact, waiting.`
`Just like how one must remove the cork in order to drink champagne,`
` before bringing the offering served at the banquet to their mouths, they were waiting for just one of {i:those}.`
`Of course, the furniture didn't know what that was.`
`...But it would come out of his mouth all by itself.`
` In the same way there is always a pop when the cork is removed, it too would certainly leave his mouth.`
`"...G...`
`......yaa...`
`ahiiii{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}iiIII!!!"`
`{nobreak:{m:-5:—}—}A scream.`
`{n}It was a sign that the modest banquet at which he was to be served...had begun.`
`"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`
`gebu{0}ki{0}kya{0}kya{0}ka{0}ku`
`oooo{0}ga{0}a{0}ge{0}o{0}e`
`oo{0}ooaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a`

`Gapupogyugukigukiboryu.`
`By now the rose garden was a garden of roses and gold.`
` A gold‐colored garden where gold butterflies, gold fairies, gold lizards rampaged and flew about wildly.`
`"Maria, hurry!!`
` Run!!`
` Hurry hurry hurry hurry!!"`
`Holding onto the gun and the blanket wrapping the ingot,`
` Rosa ran at a speed Maria couldn't catch up with, sometimes pausing to call out at Maria to run faster.`
`Therefore, she saw it every time.`
`{n}...She saw the golden pursuers chasing them from the mansion!`
`The mass of gold butterflies was chasing after them like a massive crawling hand!!`
` And horrifyingly strange‐looking shadowy figures with goat heads were chasing after them...!!`
`There was no need for her to strain her eyes.`
` Because those blazing pupils told her what would happen if she was captured.`
`"......Mama, wait,`
` Mama, wait......`
` ...Uu‐uu,`
` ......au!!"`
`Maria tripped over.`
`Rosa, ashamed that for just an instant she had entertained thoughts of abandoning her daughter and running away, kicked back against the ground and instantly reversed direction.`
`As Rosa's own child tried to stand,`
` the goat‐head that had sprinted over to get the first bite grabbed a fistful of her hair and pulled her up from the back...!!`
`"Mamaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,`
` noooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooooo!!"`
`Rosa rammed into the goat‐head with her shoulder,`
` spun,`
` bashed the back of her elbow into the goat's jaw,`
` and buried her knee into its protruding chest!!`
`And she thrust the barrel of the gun inside the goat‐head's mouth as it doubled over from the pain in its gut!`
`"......Just try laying one finger on Maria in front of me.`
` I'll show you just how lukewarm the hell you came from is."`
`The blast from the 45‐caliber Long Colt bullet exploded inside the goat‐head's throat,`
` and its medulla oblongata was instantly pulverized.`
`The goat‐head couldn't understand.`
`It had thought that women were like already opened wine bottles!`
`{n}It had thought that they were wine bottles, and that turning them upside down would immediately cause their deep‐red contents to come out!`
`"Mama!!`
` Mamaaaaaa!!"`
`Released, Maria flung her arms around Rosa.`
`But the pursuers were still coming!`
` They could see the giant goat‐heads, who had given up even pretending to be {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, running towards them from across the rose bushes.`
`Rosa spilled several extra bullets, which had been in the pocket of her coat, all over the place, and told Maria to pick them up.`
`"Y‐yes...!`
` Pick up, pick up...!!"`
`"Maria.`
` If Mama falls down,`
` run.`
` Go to the shore.`
` And swim, and swim, and swim!`
` There's no place on this island where we can survive!!"`
`"N‐no!!`
` Together with Mama!!`
` Uuu!!"`
`Rosa's gun roared four times.`
` But even though she really did land four shots in the chest of the massive, approaching goat, it didn't even flinch!!`
`The goat ran with a violent vigor, as though it planned to crush Rosa and Maria with its massive body!!`
`"Put the bullets in!!`
` Quickly!!"`
`"U‐uu!!"`
`Rosa grasped the blanket with the ingot in both hands,`
` and she herself sprinted at the goat, dragging the ingot along behind her!!`
` Without even an ounce of fear of that strange‐looking giant!!`
`If it's to protect my daughter, I'll overcome even hell!!`
`"I'll show you...`
`what a golden dream looks liiiiiiiiiiike!!!"`
`Rosa's roar.`
` The goat‐head's roar.`
`The terribly heavy ingot, after picking up a terrible centrifugal force and speed, slammed into the goat‐head's cranium.`
`Rosa pulled a fountain pen from her pocket.`
` But she held it crooked.`
` She placed it in her palm,`
` in the gap between her middle finger and her ring finger, so that it stuck out when she made a fist, almost like it was a stinger growing out.`
`She jabbed that stinger into the left eye of the goat‐head as its head toppled forward.`
` Was the goat‐head's roar a scream?`
`But Rosa's roar was different.`
`She pulled back her fist and slammed it into the fountain pen that was still sticking into the goat‐head's eye.`
` The pointed tip was gouged destructively into the depths of its head...!`
`"Mama, bullets in!!"`
`"Good job!!"`
`As I grabbed the gun Maria had thrown, I finally heard the thunderous crash of the giant tumbling to earth.`
`However, at the same time, I saw the goat‐head pursuers on the other side of the rose bushes increase in number.`
` I've gained some distance, more than enough now!`
`Holding onto the gun and the blanket wrapped around the ingot, I once again ran with Maria.`
`...Why am I running with a gun in my right hand and the gold in my left?`
`Why don't I free one hand and grasp Maria's hand...?!!`
`I can't let go of the gun that protects my body.`
`{n}I can't let go of the gold that protects my future.`
`And yet I would let go of the hand of my daughter, who {i:is} my very future...?!`
`Run.`
` Run. Run.`
`She got out of the rose garden and began to run down the staircase through the grove of trees.`
`But Rosa knew.`
` This path through the grove was only turning and twisting many times to make it seem long.`
` She tore straight through it!`
`She had always played here since she was a kid.`
`{n}So she knew!`
`To the beach. To the beach.`
` To the sea, to the sea, to the sea.`
`And after reaching the sea?`
`Nothing to do but swim, swim swim, if Maria can't swim, I'll carry her as I swim!!`
`There is nothing but death on this island!`
`"Kya!!!"`
`"Mamaaaa?!"`
`As she raced down the stairs, she took a bad step.`
`{n}A violent pain ran up her left ankle and her mind went completely blank.`
`Rosa fell down several stairs, and stared in shock at her ankle, which was bent at an odd angle.`
`...And the blanket with the ingot wasn't there.`
` She had let go of it the instant she fell, and it had disappeared somewhere into the darkness.`
`Only the gun was left.`
`The tremors in the earth were getting closer.`
`{n}It was only a matter of time before the goat‐heads flooded in.`
`She didn't want to imagine how many there would be, or how strange they would look.`
`The lightly dancing gold pursuers arrived.`
`The gold butterflies surrounded Rosa and Maria, sparkling and clamoring as though saying "the prize is here, the prize is here".`
`Rosa couldn't even try to get up.`
`{n}The violent pain from her broken ankle was so great that she couldn't ignore it, even in her last moments.`
`Aaaaaaaaaaaaah, what am I doing...`
`{n}I had the gold, it would have been worth several million yen.`
`I might have been able to start over with that!!`
` And yet I fell, lost it, and that's not all, my own life is in danger, even Maria's life is in danger?!`
`......What has my life been?!!!`
`I was born in an incomprehensible house!`
`{n}With an irritating older brother and sister since the day I was born!!`
`What did I do?!`
`No matter what I did or didn't do, I was always in trouble and bullied and made fun of!!`
` What has my life been?!?!`
`"Mama..., Mama, Mama...!!"`
`"........................"`
`The roar inside Rosa's heart shriveled away and disappeared.`
`...It disappeared when she listened to Maria's crying voice, as her daughter sobbed and clung onto her.`
`".........Maria.`
` Mama remembered that there's something she has to do.`
` Please go on ahead."`
`"No, no no no no!!`
` Want to be with Mama!!`
` Don't want Mama to die!!"`
`"Maria,`
` ...even though I'm such a bad mama,`
` ......you still say you want to be with me?"`
`"Yes...!`
` ......Want to be with Mama...`
` Want to be with Mama...!"`
`"...I made it look like I was putting you first,`
` ...but I was always putting you off.`
` I went to your sports day,`
` I went to parent's day,`
` ...but I was always thinking about how I appeared to the world, and you were never in my eyes."`
`"......Are you saying...that you want to be together, even with that kind of mama......?`
` Even though...`
`...I've been such a bad mama............!!"`
`"Hey, Mama.`
` ...Did you know?`
` There's only one Mama in the world.`
` There's no good Mama or bad Mama.`
` ...There's just one Mama.`
` So all I want is for Mama, the only Mama in the world, to be here.`
` And I want to become the only Maria for Mama."`
`".........The Maria who's in a good mood that you want to spoil, and the Maria who's a nuisance and you don't want to be around, aren't different people.`
` I'm also just one Maria.`
` ......So the scary Mama and the nice Mama are just like that.`
` ......To me,`
` ...there is just one...`
`...Mama......"`
`"...............I was...`
`......such...`
`.........an idiot...`
` .........I didn't need gold.`
` If only I had just pulled your hand...`
` ......I was such a...`
`...stupid mama...!!"`
`The shadows of the goats covered the sky even more than the trees of the forest.`
`{n}Their roars blotted out the world with fear.`
`Rosa, still hugging Maria, readied her gun with one hand.`
`"Maria, let's go together.`
` Always together.`
` ...So that Mama doesn't lose her way, always together...!"`
`"Yes...!!`
` Can see each other soon.`
` Always together...!!`
` ...Can see each other...in the Golden Land...!!"`
`"And then we'll play together!`
` Play with the "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle"!!`
` You still haven't solved more than one question, Mama, but I solved them all.`
` So I'll be the questioner!!"`
`She had bought that as a birthday present, ......and then hadn't played it with Maria after that night.`
`"Yes, let's play, together!!!`
` I promise!!!"`
`"Mamaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`Those eyes, sparkling like red‐hot lava, looked just like a group of fireflies.`
`{n}They danced, closed in, and attacked.`
`"Oooooooooooooohh, come ooooooon!!`
` Whoever wants to eat these bullets Maria chambered for me, step forwaaaaaaard,`
` uwoooo{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}oooohhh!!!"`
