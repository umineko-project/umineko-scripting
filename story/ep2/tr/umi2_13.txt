`With Jessica's death, it became certain that the culprit was hiding somewhere nearby, and that they would come after our lives if they had a chance.`
`According to Genji‐san, when tomorrow morning comes, the boat should arrive.`
`The boat has a radio, too.`
`{n}We'll probably be able to contact the police immediately with that.`
`We all gathered in the parlor, and decided to wait quietly until tomorrow.`
`I proposed that we should search throughout the mansion for clues about the culprit,`
` but Auntie Rosa rejected that, saying that if we put pressure on the culprit, or provoked them,`
` it might lead to a third murder.`
`...That was probably the right thing to do.`
`{n}Even if a bunch of amateurs like us investigated, there's no way we'd find anything.`
`It would be wisest to focus on protecting ourselves without doing anything unnecessary, and leave it to the police after tomorrow.`
`We had been tense in the beginning, but other than Auntie Rosa,`
` most of us had spent all morning watching TV and were getting bored, so our sense of danger had grown much less intense.`
`When we thought about it, even though there certainly had been six adults killed at once in the first murder,`
` that made us imagine that some back‐handed method like poison had been used.`
`And in the second murder, it was thought that those two had become sacrifices because they were unfortunately isolated from the rest of us.`
`From this, we imagined that there weren't a great number of culprits,`
` and they didn't have the ability to kill this large group gathered in the parlor all at once.`
`Right now, in this parlor, there was George‐aniki and me,`
` Maria,`
` Auntie Rosa,`
` Genji‐san, Gohda‐san, Shannon‐san, Kumasawa‐san, ......and finally Doctor Nanjo—a total of nine people were here.`
`Furthermore, Auntie Rosa was even armed with a gun.`
`Surely, with this many people staying in this room, they wouldn't be able to touch us easily.`
`That feeling of security, along with the passage of time, allowed us to recover from the shock of that morning bit by bit...`
`Incidentally, lunchtime had just ended for us.`
`{n}However, it had been a canned‐food lunch, a far cry from last night's dinner which Gohda‐san had skillfully made for us.`
`...Auntie Rosa too had suspected that poison had been used in the murder of those six people.`
`...So, we probably couldn't deny the possibility that the culprit had snuck into the kitchen during all that confusion in the morning, and mixed poison in with the ingredients there.`
`......Auntie Rosa had ordered all of us not to put anything into our mouths except safe foods like canned food, until the police came.`
`As a cook, Gohda‐san must have felt very let down.`
`As though he wanted to display his skill anyway, he said that he at least wanted to bring the plates and pile them up with canned food.`
`At first, Auntie Rosa had been reluctant, examining each one of the plates that were brought, but she hadn't been able to find anything to complain about,`
` and Gohda‐san's "Chef's Pick Canned Food Combo Lunch" had become a reality.`
`Gohda‐san had said something about taste being savored not just with the tongue, but with the eyes too.`
`...I found myself agreeing—it had been the same canned food we ate for breakfast, but it felt like something completely different...`
`"Uu, Battler.`
` Look, look.`
` Here, "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle".`
` Uu."`
`As I was sitting lazily on a sofa, with no desire to watch TV,`
` Maria came over, pulled a picture book out of her handbag, and held it out to me as she said that.`
`"......What is that book?`
` "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle"?`
` ..................Let's have a look‐see."`
`"Wolves and Sheep Puzzle".`
`{n}It was a phrase that Auntie Rosa had said this morning when we had gone to call on Jessica.`
`...At the time, I hadn't known what it meant, and then after that, there was the uproar when Jessica's body was found, so I'd forgotten about it completely.`
`The book that Maria held out to me looked like a foreign picture book or something that had been translated.`
`Opening it, I could tell that the book contained an assortment of puzzles.`
`"Uu.`
` So there's several wolves and sheep, okay?`
` And the puzzle is to take them to the other side using one boat."`
`"......Hmmmm?`
` I've heard of a game with rules like this.`
` So this is that, but with wolves and sheep?"`
`It was a very simple puzzle, passed on from long ago.`
`{n}Let's try one of the problems.`
`On the right bank, there are two wolves and two sheep.`
`{n}There is a boat that as many as two animals can ride on, and using it, you have to move all four of them to the opposite left bank.`
`There are two rules.`
`The first is regarding the boat.`
`{n}It can be paddled by wolves or sheep, and even just by one animal on its own.`
`{n}But it can only hold up to two.`
`The second is regarding the wolves.`
`{n}When they are greater in number than the sheep in that location, they attack the sheep and it's game over.`
`For example, at the start of the game:`
`{n}Both sheep ride the boat, and go to the other side.`
`{n}Then one sheep gets off, and the other goes back to the first bank.`
`......When it does, there are two wolves on the first bank.`
`{n}And a single sheep returns there.`
`When that happens, there are more wolves, so the sheep is attacked and it's game over.`
`On either bank or even the boat, there must not be more wolves than sheep.`
`It's a puzzle about how to shuttle them across in the boat under these conditions.`
`By the way, the right answer is: On the first turn, move both wolves to the opposite bank.`
`{n}Then one wolf comes back.`
`On the second turn, move two sheep to the opposite bank.`
`{n}Then one wolf comes back.`
`Then on the third turn, put that last wolf that was on the right bank on the boat and cross to the opposite bank, and congratulations, transport successful.`
`Partway, there may be the same number of wolves and sheep in the boat or on either side, but that isn't a problem.`
`You only lose when the number of wolves is greater.`
`This book symbolizes it using wolves and sheep, but there are probably lots of people who know this same game with a different symbolism...`
`It looked like Maria wanted to test whether I too could solve the puzzles she knew how to solve,`
` and she kept showing me different pages, saying "solve this one" and "this one's hard".`
`What had been happening when Auntie Rosa had said the name of this puzzle...`
`That's right.`
`...When we'd decided to go call Jessica, we had been talking about how many men should go,`
` and Auntie Rosa mentioned the "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle", and said that we should all go together......`
`".................................Wait a sec..."`
`That could only mean one thing.`
` ...Auntie Rosa was saying that there are "wolves" among us.`
`And when the number of wolves and sheep is balanced, we're safe, but when a situation comes up where that isn't the case, the wolves will bear their fangs—is that what she's thinking......?`
`At the time we had found our parents' corpses, Auntie Rosa was already suspecting that the servants might be "wolves".`
`While she didn't know whether it was all of them or just some, she had sniffed out the possibility that "wolves" were hiding among them.`
`......Well, yeah.`
`That murder scene was pretty damn elaborate.`
`{n}It's easy to imagine that there were multiple culprits.`
`And considering that she had that idea already in mind when we went to Jessica's room,`
` where Jessica had been alone with a servant, Kanon, and had been killed,`
` .........it isn't hard to imagine why Auntie Rosa had suspected the servants so persistently...`
`"All you servants.`
` Gohda‐san is going to the kitchen to wash the dishes.`
` Just in case, would you please all go with him?"`
`"My apologies, everyone.`
` Let us go as a group."`
`"......Shannon, Kumasawa.`
` Let's go."`
`"Yes, yes, coming.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐ho."`
`"Well then, George‐san, excuse me for now."`
`"Okay.`
` .........Take care.`
` Ah, Auntie Rosa, could I go as well?"`
`"I'm sorry, would you remain here, George‐kun?`
` There's something I want to talk to you about."`
`"......Is that so?`
` Sorry, Shannon.`
` Anyway, take care.`
` ...Don't be alone."`
`"...Yes..."`
`"Excuse me, Doctor Nanjo.`
` ......I wanted to consult with you about something."`
`"Yes, ......what might that be?`
` ........................"`
`The servants put the dishes and empty cans on the serving cart and started to head out into the corridor.`
`Behind them, Auntie Rosa was talking to Doctor Nanjo about something in a small voice.`
`"...Alright.`
` I will go."`
`"Yes, if you wouldn't mind."`
`Doctor Nanjo closed the book he had been reading, stood from the sofa, and followed after the servants...`
`Auntie Rosa stuck her head out into the hallway, and after watching them leave completely, she closed the door, and spoke.`
`"Listen, everyone.`
` Now everyone here is an Ushiromiya."`
`"......Hmm?`
` Yes, that is true..."`
`"So you're saying that you've chased out all of the "wolves"?`
` ......Auntie Rosa."`
`With that one sentence, Auntie Rosa's gaze grew sharp.`
`{n}...Apparently she had picked up on my sardonic tone.`
`......Auntie Rosa laughed lightly.`
`"...Your mind sure works fast, Battler‐kun.`
` I like clever kids.`
` It means there's less to explain."`
`"Uu.`
` Battler, smart...?`
` Can you solve this?`
` Hard one on page 64.`
` Uu!"`
`"Maria, sit there watching TV for a while.`
` Mama wants to talk with Battler‐kun and George‐kun."`
`"..................Uu."`
`"Auntie Rosa.`
` ...I heard about the puzzle from Battler‐kun.`
` ...I don't think it's bad to be very careful, but I think being too suspicious isn't good either."`
`"Whether the real culprit is {f:5:Beatrice} or not,`
` I think there is reason for us to suspect that the servants are in league with her."`
`"......In the first murder, where Nii‐san and the others were killed,`
` they'd been given a very brutal treatment, right?`
` Did that look like something that could be done alone?"`
`"............Maybe our mystery guest {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama worked all night and did it all."`
`"And the incident with the master keys involving the door to Jessica's room?`
` Isn't that proof that one of the servants was involved?"`
`"......nn.................."`
`Only a master key could have locked the door to Jessica's room.`
`{n}...In that case, we can only suppose that one of the servants locked it......`
`.........No,`
` ......wait.`
`"Flip over the chessboard.`
` ......That's strange, Auntie Rosa."`
`"After killing Jessica, why did the culprit go to all the trouble of locking the door?`
` It was inevitable that the owners of the master keys were gonna be suspected if they did that.`
` ......There was no need to deliberately lock the door."`
`"...Tha‐that's right.`
` It's just as Battler‐kun says!`
` They have no reason to deliberately go and do something that makes themselves suspicious."`
`"Yes.`
` That's an interesting thought.`
` Of course, I also thought that."`
`"......If that's so, then the person who locked it wanted to cast suspicion on the servants, and locked that door without a master key.`
` But that's impossible.`
` Right?"`
`......That's right.`
` If there was a trick that could lock the door without a master key, this would be a good disguise aimed at casting doubt on the servants.`
`...If the culprit wanted to isolate us and attack us one by one, this trick was a very effective one that could even give rise to paranoia.`
`However, there was no way to lock that door without using a master key...`
`"How can you make the claim that there's no way to lock the door without using a master key?`
` Isn't that a Devil's Proof, like Rudolf nii‐san was talking about?`
` {i:Maybe it was locked by a method we can't think of}."`
`"Even if we can't think of it, that doesn't disprove that there was some unknown trick."`
`"............Well, sure, but...`
` So is that it?`
` The suspicious ones are guilty...?"`
`"I don't know the practical details of the trick, but I have a general idea.`
` My apologies, but if we suppose that Kanon‐kun was the culprit, it can be explained extremely easily.`
` Even as to why there was no corpse."`
`"Huh......`
` But Kanon‐kun wasn't holding a master key, right?!`
` Putting aside the other servants, at least Kanon‐kun shouldn't have been able to lock the door!"`
`"......I see.`
` ...So that's why you told us to search in the closet and everywhere else right after we entered Jessica's room.`
` ......Auntie Rosa, ...your mind works faster than I could imagine judging by your normal appearance."`
`"The brain speed of a little sister is always the big sister's minus 1.`
` ...I feel glad that there's no one I need to worry about now."`
`George‐aniki realized that she was referring to Auntie Eva,`
` and seemed a little disturbed about how he should take that nasty remark...`
`"......I, I'm sorry.`
` Could you explain it so that even I can understand?"`
`"Kanon‐kun's master key was in Jessica‐chan's pocket, closed up inside a locked room.`
` After the door was locked, it should have been impossible for him to pull a stunt like putting it in her pocket from outside the room...!"`
`"That's not it, Aniki.`
` ......If it was done in the way Auntie Rosa imagines, ......this trick could only be used by Kanon‐kun."`
`"...And, the door could be locked without a key, while the master key was still in Jessica's pocket.`
` ......And, as a result, his corpse would also disappear."`
`"H‐......how?!`
` How would he lock the door without a key?!"`
`"It's simple.`
` George‐kun, when you return home, you lock the door, right?`
` You twist the knob, click, right?"`
`"Huh...?!`
` .........C‐`
`...could it be...`
` ......No, but...`
`...Kanon‐kun wasn't anywhere......"`
`"...It looks like you've got it, Aniki.`
` .........That's what Auntie Rosa was searching inside the room for."`
`"......She was searching for Kanon‐kun, who had locked the door from the inside, stuck the key in Jessica's pocket,`
` and was hiding somewhere, waiting for us to go away."`
`The simplest locked‐room trick.`
` ...In other words, to hide inside the locked room after committing the murder.`
`...And if he could get out after those who discovered the body left, it would create a perfect locked‐room murder......`
`"We searched that room, but we couldn't find anything.`
` ...But, that doesn't mean we can rule out something like a secret hidden passage in that room that only the servants know about."`
`"I don't know where that might be hidden,`
` but if we assume that there was a hidden passage, we can say for certain that it was impossible for anyone except him."`
`"..................You know, that line of reasoning,`
` ...it was the first thing I thought of, too.`
` ......It's the reasoning I hate the most, so I wanted to destroy it in the very beginning..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...`
` "{p:1:Kanon was killed in this room}", yes?"`
`"Because you seemed to suspect Kanon as the culprit, you made me repeat this to destroy that possibility right away.`
` I understand, I understand.`
` *cackle*......"`
`"...So this is what I thought of next.`
` A theory that there were actually three people in that room.`
` Jessica and Kanon‐kun were victims.`
` And the culprit, the guest {f:5:Beatrice}, was also there with them."`
`"You wanted to make it "the human me" who committed the crime without using magic.`
` I see, a strange theory that fits you perfectly.`
` *giggle*giggle*."`
`"......I guessed that you killed those two, then locked the door from the inside.`
` And you carried Kanon‐kun's corpse using some secret method that normal people wouldn't notice.`
` ......In other words, you used a secret door to escape."`
`"But you told me it in red.`
` ...You said that there are no types of hidden doors in that room."`
`"Indeed.`
` No secret passage exists unknown to you all.`
` Was it Knox, or was it Van Dine?`
` It seems that in mystery novels, there must never be hidden passages, no matter what.`
` I also follow that etiquette."`
`"In other words, even without having to thoroughly search a room, great detectives can state with confidence that there are no secret passages.`
` .........*cackle*cackle*, humans have it so easy with their little detective games."`
`"Damn you, talking so big...`
` Thanks.`
` Thanks to the witch's arrangement, I can say for sure that the room doesn't have a hidden door without searching the whole thing."`
`"Indeed.`
` {p:1:There are no hidden doors in this room}.`
` {p:1:There is no way to get in or out other than the door and the windows}."`
`"......Which means...`
`...that theory Auntie Rosa's so confident in...`
`...is wrong."`
`"...Plus, frustratingly, it's impossible to disprove that theory.`
` ......If you, the witch, say in red`
` "`
`{p:1:there are no hidden doors}", then it's settled."`
`"......However, no matter how much a human like me tries to argue against her, Auntie Rosa probably won't accept it.`
` {i:Humans can't prove there's no hidden door}."`
`"It's a Devil's Proof.`
` ...............Damn.`
` Sure is convenient being a witch..."`
`"......No way!`
` You're calling Kanon‐kun the culprit because of a hidden door that we don't even know exists...`
` I...can't accept that."`
`"If you can't accept that, tell me some reasoning that's easier to accept, then?`
` .........There is none.`
` I've been thinking the whole time.`
` There's nothing but this!"`
`".............................."`
`"George‐kun, you had a good relationship with Shannon‐chan, right?`
` So I think it would be hard for you to accept that all of the servants are the culprits."`
`"I also don't want to believe that Shannon‐chan is one of the culprits.`
` .........But whether it's all of them or not, the culprit, or maybe an accomplice, is definitely in that group.`
` You must not fail to see that!"`
`"......If you thought that there were more wolves in addition to Kanon‐kun,`
` ...then causing that uproar by saying that Kanon‐kun was the culprit in Jessica's room was to see the servants' reactions...?"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` And as a result, I began to suspect them even more.`
` ......I'm certain there are wolves among the servants.`
` Certain.`
` And, just like the "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle", while they are normally docile, they will surely attack if they get the chance."`
`"......Jessica‐chan was a lone sheep on the boat.`
` ......In that puzzle, they may not attack when there is a balance between wolves and sheep, but our puzzle is different.`
` Depending on the opportunity and the number of people, they'll attack even if there is a balance.`
` Just like when Jessica‐chan was killed!"`
`".........Th‐there's something I don't like!`
` In that case, Shannon, who you sent to the kitchen, is in a dangerous situation, isn't she?!!`
` We should also go to the kitchen right now!`
` No matter who might or might not be a wolf!`
` If we can form a balance by gathering together, I think we should maintain that!!"`
`"......Shannon‐chan went to see Father along with Genji‐san.`
` She was isolated then, but she wasn't killed."`
`"Because Genji‐san wasn't a wolf either?"`
`"......No!`
` Because they were both wolves!!"`
`"Shannon isn't the kind of person who would take part in a crime!!`
` Even if it's you, Auntie Rosa, I cannot ignore that.`
` I demand that you take back what you just said...!"`
`"...I hate to say this in front of Aniki, but that argument...`
`...feels just like something Auntie Eva would say.`
` If we can't argue back, then you automatically assume that you're right.`
` ......Looks like you can't fight your blood after all, Auntie."`
`".........Even I don't think of myself as very praiseworthy right now."`
`"But you know what? I'm a mother!`
` I would even become a demon to protect Maria's safety.`
` Honestly speaking, I wish I could just shut myself away somewhere alone with Maria."`
`"......But I also plan to act as a mother to you two.`
` Right now, you are as good as my children.`
` ......You may not be my own children, ...but I won't forsake you.`
` .........Ever."`
`"......Sure, thanks."`
`"I just wanted to warn you not to be careless, as your mother.`
` {i:Always remain where I can see you}.`
` I will protect you."`
`"And at the same time, you'll be observing us to make sure we aren't "wolves".`
` ...Yeah, thanks a lot for that.`
` Can you prove that you aren't a "wolf" yourself?"`
`"Yes, I can."`
`"That's a quick answer.`
` How?"`
`"With this.`
` ...This is my proof."`
`Auntie Rosa held up the gun, and pointed the barrel at me.`
`But that was only for an instant.`
`She immediately lowered the gun, laughing impishly.`
`{n}......But to me, the time I spent staring down the barrel of the gun had felt like an eternity.`
`"...How does that gun prove that you aren't the culprit, Auntie Rosa?"`
`"Think about it.`
` What if I were the culprit?`
` Do you think I would let by this once‐in‐a‐lifetime chance I got when the servants left?"`
`"I could just shoot you both, bang, and all that's left is to come out with a fitting excuse.`
` Something like, {f:5:Beatrice} appeared outside the window and shot at us with a gun.`
` I would claim that I fired two shots back at her, and throw the two shots' worth of empty cartridges onto the floor."`
`"That's a crazy wild argument, but it does make sense. Ihihihi!"`
`"There's something Krauss nii‐san often used to say.`
` Might makes right.`
` .........I wonder if this proves that?"`
`".........I'm sorry, you two.`
` I've lost a lot of my composure after all these crimes since morning.`
` You know how I normally am, so right now I must seem on‐edge and a little short‐tempered."`
`"...But understand.`
` I want to protect you from the malicious culprit.`
` I will become a demon to do that.`
` That's all there is to it.`
` ......I'm sorry for saying something that's angered you.`
` Battler‐kun, George‐kun.`
` ...Let's make up."`
`George‐aniki was wearing an unsatisfied expression.`
`{n}...He probably couldn't forgive the damage done to Shannon's honor.`
`...What about me...?`
` Several bits of circumstantial evidence hint strongly at the servants' participation.`
`......I don't want to believe that one of them is the culprit, or possibly colluding with the culprit,`
` ...but in the current situation, that's nothing but wishful thinking.`
`Who should I believe?`
`In the first place, who is the culprit?`
`{n}Are there accomplices?`
`{n}If so, how many?!`
`......I feel like I'm constantly only suspecting the people connected to all this.`
`...I find myself quickly forgetting about that 19th person,`
` the guest, {f:5:Beatrice}, who came yesterday and boldly called herself the Golden Witch.`
`I haven't actually seen her face.`
`I've heard that she's like a double of the witch in that portrait,`
` but because I haven't seen her directly, no matter how hard I try, I can't really feel like there are 19 people on this island.`
`...So I easily slip into the illusion that the culprit is one of the 18...`
`Damn it......`
` Come out, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`If you're the bad guy, then act like the bad guy, and show yourself, laughing in a high‐pitched voice and looking down on us.`
`Just like a bad guy in one of those dramas who, even once they're exposed as the culprit,`
` aggressively says "is there any proof?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` Is there any proof?"`
`"Shut up, you keep your trap shut for a minute..."`
`There were five humans in the kitchen, but it was very quiet, filled only with the sound of the rain.`
`It was only accented by the sound of Shannon and Kumasawa washing the dishes.`
`Gohda was using the leftovers from breakfast and lunch as ingredients for a servants' soup.`
`......Rosa had suspected that poison might have been added to the food, so they had decided to eat canned food, but it hadn't really been filling.`
`But Gohda thought that she was being too careful.`
`{n}So he was spontaneously creating a soup to be served only to those that wanted to eat it.`
`Shannon and Kumasawa were washing the dishes that the food had been arranged on.`
`On the inside, they thought maybe Gohda should be the one to wash them since he had been the one who wanted the food on plates in the first place,`
` but they left their complaints unsaid for the time being.`
`Genji and Nanjo were facing each other across a crude chess set which had seen many years.`
`...It had still only just begun.`
`And because the opening game of the experienced players had been endlessly refined,`
` it looked like a ritual where they just moved specified pieces in a specified order.`
`"That's a nice aroma...`
` You wouldn't get this from canned food."`
`"It was made only from sealed ingredients, so there won't be any poison mixed in."`
`"I have made enough for everybody, so please, eat.`
` Of course, I will also taste for poison.`
` Please feel secure and eat."`
`"That really is a nice aroma.`
` Gohda‐san, your makeshift servant meals really are delicious."`
`"It's natural that you can create delicious food if you buy delicious ingredients.`
` ......My teacher taught me that perfecting your ability to make delicious food from whatever is at hand is what makes you a true cook."`
`"That was a good teacher.`
` Thanks to him, it looks like I shall be able to enjoy some truly delicious soup."`
`"......Although it is a shame that it was made from ingredients intended for all of the family members to eat."`
`"I'm sure that Rosa‐san is also tired after everything that happened this morning.`
` It is only natural."`
`"But thanks to that, we get to eat some soup made from delicious ingredients, hoh‐hoh‐ho."`
`Rosa had fervently told everyone that they didn't realize the danger they were in, and that they must suspect that poison was mixed in with the food.`
`The atmosphere in that place had led to their agreement,`
` but their hunger wouldn't be overcome by that momentary emotion.`
`"Ironically, it has become a soup that we normally wouldn't be able to savor.`
` If possible, I would like to also serve it to everyone in the parlor, but..."`
`"......Seeing as that goes against Rosa‐sama's instructions, you'd better not.`
` ......Those who want to eat it can do so."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` Skillfully taking a breather when no one is looking is one of the things you learn as a servant, after all."`
`Kumasawa laughed loudly, and Shannon and Gohda laughed with her.`
`It seemed that, in an area where only their fellow servants were gathered, they could be very relaxed.`
`Shannon didn't like Gohda's occasional dishonesty,`
` but she knew that there was no falsehood in his childish smile when he cooked,`
` nor in his desire that people enjoy his food.`
`So even though it was a little aggravating to be made to wash the dishes,`
` she couldn't really hate him.`
`However, they couldn't have dreamed that Rosa was calling them wolves in the parlor at exactly the same moment that they were spending their time peacefully like this......`
`At that time, several of the servants heard a sound like something was being dragged, and then a thump.`
`When a servant was out carrying a mountain of trash bags on a rainy day,`
` or doing some work in a raincoat, they would create exactly this kind of noise and presence as they returned and hovered around the back door.`
`So after hearing that sound, at first, none of them noticed anything out of the ordinary...`
`But they quickly realized.`
` ............In a situation where everyone was either in the kitchen or the parlor, who in the world was at the back door...?!`
`As the servants all looked at each other, they checked to make sure that each one of them knew what that sound meant.`
`"Who, ..........who could it be......?"`
`The servants knew the mansion's layout well.`
`So they understood how unimaginable it would be for someone from the parlor to actually go outside in this typhoon,`
` go all the way around, and come up to this back door.`
`Then was it Kinzo?`
` ...They found it even more difficult to imagine that Kinzo, who never left his study even under normal conditions,`
` would dash out into the middle of this typhoon for no apparent reason, and come to the back of the house, where only low‐class people came in or out.`
`"......Tha‐`
`......that wasn't...`
`our imagination, was it......?"`
`".............Awawawawawawawawa..."`
`Shannon and Kumasawa drew close together, fearfully looking at the back door...`
`"...Who, ...who is it......?"`
`As Gohda fearfully approached the back door, he called out.`
`{n}......And he checked with his eyes the location of a butcher's knife set on a nearby sink.`
`......He didn't pick it up yet.`
`{n}Because there was still a possibility that this was a member of the family.`
`{n}However, that possibility wasn't possible...`
`There was no response from across the door to Gohda's initial question.`
`{n}...Maybe his voice had been so quiet that it hadn't reached through all the wind and rain outside.`
`".........Genji‐san."`
`"......Yes.`
` .........Stand back, Doctor Nanjo and the women."`
`"...Who, ......who in the world could it be......"`
`Genji took a knife with a classical design from a stationery box placed near the chess set.`
`...It was something to be used instead of a paper knife to open envelopes for invoices and bills.`
`But it was fundamentally a knife.`
`{n}So the blade on it could injure someone...`
`Genji hid it in his sleeve with a well‐practiced manner.`
`{n}Then he too approached the back door, and signaled to Gohda with a silent nod.`
`Gohda cautiously approached the back door, .........and slowly started to open it......`
`"Wa...wahyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...!!!"`
`The figure of a person suddenly shuffled into sight, landed on its knees, and fell over.`
`{n}Gohda fell backwards onto his backside in shock.`
`That figure was soaked with rain, smeared with mud, and drenched with blood...`
`"K‐............Kanon‐kun?!`
` Kanon‐kun!!"`
`".........Kanon.`
` Are you alright...?`
` Doctor Nanjo...!"`
`It was Kanon.`
`......His breath was feeble, ......and the puddles of mud he left quickly became drenched bright‐red.`
`When Nanjo held him and turned him face up, there was a deep, gruesome scar right in the center of his chest, as though he had been run through with a spear or something.`
`Even now, deep‐red blood poured out from there...!`
`"Th‐th‐th‐...this is horrible...`
` Wh‐what shall we do—first aid kit? First aid kit?!"`
`"Kanon‐san, put your hand against the wound!`
` Please, push firmly!`
` Let's carry him to the bed in the servant room!!`
` Everyone, please, lend a hand."`
`"C‐come now, Kanon‐san!`
` Please, hang in there a little longer...!"`
`"Hang in there!!`
` It's alright now!!`
` So don't take your hand from the wound...!!"`
`"Anyway, let's carry him to the servant room.`
` ......Kumasawa, inform Rosa‐sama that we have found Kanon."`
`"Wai‐.........wait.........`
` ......Not...`
`......Rosa‐sama........."`
`"...Please wait!`
` Kanon‐san said not Rosa‐sama..."`
`"......Wh‐what do you mean, Kanon‐kun...!"`
`"............Not now.`
` Let's carry him to the servant room quickly.`
` Kumasawa, don't tell Rosa‐sama yet.`
` ...We'll do it after we hear the situation from Kanon."`
`"Y‐......yes......`
` ......hiiiiii..."`
`After appearing in this horrible state, he had said not to tell Rosa.`
`......That could only mean something very disquieting.`
`{n}......An eerie sense of panic rose to their faces...`
`"C‐come now, everyone!`
` Let's hurry and carry him...!`
` Quickly, quickly...!"`
`Kanon's wound was unbelievably deep,`
` ...and judging from Nanjo's pale face, it was almost a miracle that he was still conscious...`
`"......This is......horrible...`
` It appears that he has been stabbed with something like a spear.`
` I‐if it hasn't reached the lungs, I might be able to do something......`
` Anyway, stop the bleeding......!"`
`"u...guo......aaaaga!!!"`
`No matter how much Nanjo tried to wipe off that gushing deep‐red blood, ...he couldn't wipe it he couldn't wipe it he couldn't wipe it all away...!`
` And each time, the wound was aggravated, causing Kanon to cry in anguish...`
`"Kanon‐kun, Kanon‐kun Kanon‐kun!`
` Hang in there... Hang in there...!!"`
`"Doctor Nanjo!`
` A new towel...!`
` ...How...horrible...!!"`
`"What is his condition...?"`
`".........In all honesty, ...it is so severe that I cannot believe he is alive...`
` Maybe the location of the stab was fortunate...`
` But the blood loss is too horrible...!`
` A blood transfusion is necessary, but that's impossible until tomorrow...!"`
`"......u...`
`...*cough*cough*!!`
` Ro‐`
`......Rosa‐sama...`
`......she......`
`ugaaaaaa!!"`
`"D‐don't talk, Kanon‐kun!`
` Your wound will open...!"`
`"......Rosa‐sama...came...`
`......t‐`
`......to Milady and...`
`...me, and........."`
`"Wh‐......what did you say......"`
`"Rosa‐sama......did...?`
` Oooooh... Could that mean, could that mean..."`
`"......Are you certain?"`
`"Yes.........`
` ......I'm certain......it was Rosa‐sama........."`
`"Come now, don't speak any more...!`
` Kumasawa‐san, please grab another first aid kit!"`
`".........Genji‐san.`
` ......Is it possible Rosa‐sama......did such a thing?"`
`"............I don't know."`
`Disregarding Nanjo and Kumasawa, who were struggling hard and stained with blood as they tried to stop the bleeding, Genji and Gohda faced each other...`
`......Because if what Kanon had said was the truth,`
` ......Rosa was the culprit who killed Jessica.`
`"Curse you, Rosa......`
` How could you do that...to Milady......`
` ...I'm gonna kill you......ugnnnggg...!"`
`Kanon screamed even more hatefully...`
`{n}...His hate‐filled voice made it seem like he had seen Jessica being harmed right before his eyes.`
`"......Cer‐certainly, Rosa‐sama may have had a reason to kill Milady.`
` If the Ushiromiya family was wiped out, the inheritance would all go to Rosa‐sama..."`
`"If so, Battler‐sama and George‐sama are in danger...!`
` Not only is Rosa‐sama holding a gun, but right now, they are the only ones in the parlor...!`
` Genji‐san, isn't this quite perilous......?!"`
`"................................."`
`".............................."`
`Shannon suddenly ran out into the corridor.`
`...Her expression was complex and tragic, as though she didn't know what to believe...`
`Shannon ran.`
` To where?`
`......The inside of the mansion had been scrupulously cleaned, so they probably wouldn't be easy to find.`
`She might find some if she searched the rose garden, but they would probably have all been lost in this wind and rain...`
`That's right, ......the boiler room isn't cleaned very often.`
`{n}...If she went there, ......she might be able to find some...`
`Shannon ran down the stairs to search for {i:those} in the underground boiler room...`
`Had some medicine taken effect at the brink of death,`
` or had Kanon finally stopped even feeling pain?`
`...For the time being, Kanon had at least gotten over his painful gasping.`
`Nanjo apparently didn't think of this as that great of a trend, and didn't let his eyes off Kanon for a second.`
`Kumasawa firmly gripped Kanon's hand, and kept encouraging him, so that his will to stay alive didn't fall asleep.`
`Genji and Gohda seemed bewildered at how to deal with the truth that Kanon had risked his life to deliver...`
`".........I believe Rosa‐sama's gun had four or five shots loaded."`
`"That is no small number.`
` ...But loading cartridges into that gun should require quite a lot of practice.`
` We might unfortunately allow her to get one shot off, but if everyone attacks her at once, we should be able to take the gun from her before she shoots again..."`
`".........On this island, we may have a doctor, but there's no medicine, and no hospital.`
` ......If you're shot in the wrong place, ...you're dead."`
`"I understand that, but...`
` More importantly, if we don't move quickly, there is also the possibility that another crime will occur...!`
` I get the feeling that Rosa‐sama skillfully chased us out.`
` There is a possibility that George‐sama and Battler‐sama are being killed right about now...!"`
`"..........................."`
`"......Ho...hohohohoho.`
` If the opponent is so dangerous, wouldn't it be better if we didn't provoke them too much...?"`
`"But there is still much time before tomorrow comes...!`
` We can't even imagine what strategy she will use!`
` Genji‐san, we should be the ones to make the first move.`
` If we can at least take the gun from her under some pretext, things might work out...!"`
`"There are four or five cartridges, are there not?`
` That means there aren't enough to kill all of us...`
` If we don't carelessly provoke her, surely even Rosa‐sama wouldn't recklessly—"`
`"............No, she said it.`
` She said she'll massacre all of us."`
`Kanon, who they thought had been sleeping quietly, suddenly started talking brightly.`
`Almost like he had been awake the whole time and had suddenly opened his mouth.`
`He looked firm and steady, and Nanjo was slightly relieved, but thinking of the deepness of that wound, he just couldn't wipe away a certain creepy feeling.`
`......He knew because he was a doctor.`
`Kanon should have been expected to fall unconscious after losing so much blood.`
`{n}And yet somehow, he had preserved his awareness so clearly.`
`......Youth?`
` Or tenacity?`
`{n}...Sometimes the power of human life did surpass common knowledge......`
`When they had stopped the bleeding, to make sure there were no foreign objects inside the affected area,`
` Nanjo had groped around a bit inside the bleeding hole with tweezers, and the great depth of the wound had surprised him.`
`...The wound had certainly reached as far as his lungs.`
`......And yet, ...and yet...`
`{n}......No, on the other hand, the fact that he is alive is fortunate...`
`......But Kanon had spoken clearly.`
`{n}...He had hatefully said that the one named Rosa had created this wound, and was repeating curses and enraged words.`
`"...She wants to kill everyone by any means necessary before the typhoon passes, so that she can have the Master's wealth all to herself.`
` She told me that clearly."`
`".........Damn...!`
` What a person...`
` Genji‐san, what should we do?!`
` Do we also not need some kind of weapons...?"`
`"......I can't believe it so suddenly.`
` ......That Rosa‐sama would do something like......"`
`"Genji‐sama, it isn't a question of whether you believe or not.`
` She told me.`
` I heard it.`
` {f:5:Why} won't you believe me?"`
`"D‐don't get up...`
` You'll worsen your wound..."`
`Kanon sat up on the bed, and spoke to Genji, who was making no effort to believe Kanon's story.`
`"She will definitely kill all of us.`
` She's surely killed all of the people in the parlor by now.`
` If we don't kill her first, it will absolutely be us who are killed first.`
` Just like how I was killed first, everyone else will also be killed first.`
` Kill or be killed.`
` Kill or be killed kill or be killed."`
`"...K‐.........Kanon‐san, ......you...`
` ......Does it really not hurt...?"`
`"......Oh, this?`
` It isn't a serious wound."`
`"Wh‐...what do you mean, not a serious wound, ...you......"`
`"It really isn't a big deal.`
` It doesn't hurt at all anymore—it really isn't a serious wound."`
`As Kanon said that, he began to untie his own bandages which had been painstakingly wrapped...`
`The gruesome hole in his chest was immediately exposed...`
`"K‐Kanon‐san...!`
` You mustn't do something like that!`
` Quickly, lie down...!"`
`"I said it's fine.`
` ......Look.`
` See...?`
` It's...not...a serious wound, right...?"`
`Kanon showed off his gaping wound, which was still slowly spitting out foamy blood.`
`...Everyone averted their eyes reflexively.`
`"See, I told you that it wasn't a serious wound at all..."`
`"S‐......stop that... You mustn't play with your wound......"`
`"...Look, see?`
` ......It isn't a deep wound...at all.`
` .........Look.`
` ..................Look."`
`Kanon held up two fingers, showed them to everyone, and slowly started to stick them into the gruesome wound right in the center of his chest...`
`......Plunging, slimy, squishy, wet.`
`{n}The fingers...went in deep...to the base...`
` ......Squich, gloop, blorp...`
`"Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii...!!`
` K‐K‐K‐Kanon‐san, stop it, stop it...!!"`
`Having stuck his fingers completely into his chest......up to their base,`
` ......he slowly pulled them out in exactly the same way...`
`The fingers he pulled out were stained a sticky, solid, deep‐red color, and there was even a thread hanging...`
`...The fingers were, all the way to their base, covered......in deep red...`
`"......Y‐`
`.........you...`
` ......Wh‐wh‐wh‐what in the world.................."`
`".........See?`
` It is...not a serious wound...at all, you see?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`Just then, the door opened vigorously, and Shannon appeared.`
`...Even after she saw Kanon stained with fresh blood, her impregnable expression didn't falter.`
`"......Hey, Nee‐san.`
` Where'd you go?`
` I'm on the verge of death here, where'd you go?"`
`"Well.`
` I went to the boiler room.`
` Looking for something.`
` .........More importantly, I want to check.`
` Are you really...Kanon‐kun?"`
`"......Huh, ......huhh...?"`
`It was only natural.`
` Everyone believed he was Kanon.`
`{n}So they couldn't understand the meaning of Shannon's question.`
`When they looked, they noticed that Shannon was holding a handkerchief in her hand.`
`It was filthy, and looked like she had wiped up some trash or dust.`
`{n}And while holding that, she approached Kanon, .........and drew close to his legs.`
`"What is that......?"`
`"It's a handkerchief with a spider's web wiped onto it."`
`".....................`
` ...Why something like that?"`
`"If you're Kanon‐kun, you should be alright.`
` ......But if {i:spiders are your natural enemy}, I thought you might hate it."`
`"...........................`
` Hahaha, oh no.`
` Why would I hate spiders?"`
`"Sorry, I'll try it."`
`"......Sha‐...Shannon‐san."`
`When Shannon brought that handkerchief close to Kanon's thigh, ......something happened in an instant.`
`It happened all at once.`
` The human eye couldn't have followed it.`
`Kanon jumped back like a wild goat, ...fleeing from the thing Shannon was holding.`
`And his arm drew trails with some kind of afterglow that flashed purple.`
`They were three beautiful purple trails drawn in an arc, and they were traced across the throats of Nanjo and Kumasawa, who had been tending to him.`
`And Nanjo and Kumasawa's throats......had opened like gaping mouths, ...and it was the very instant before the blood was about to start spewing out.`
`The third purple trail should have traced across Shannon's throat.`
`{n}But Shannon wasn't there.`
`Because Genji, who had been behind her, had wrapped his own arm around Shannon's neck and pulled her back.`
`This all happened in an instant.`
`"...........................!!!"`
`In the instant Gohda tried to think fast in an attempt to understand this scene, the frozen moment in time shattered.`
`Blood spewed forcefully from Nanjo and Kumasawa's necks, which had been torn open.`
`Still mid‐jump, Kanon wall‐kicked off a picture frame that had been hanging from the wall behind him, springing forward just like a cat, and aiming for Shannon's throat again.`
`But Kanon's target once again disappeared from in front of him.`
` Because Genji had pulled Shannon again, and the two of them had fallen onto the ground, keeping flat to the floor.`
`"Nice reflexes, you senile old piece of furniture!!"`
`"......Gohda!"`
`"Uu...uooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhh!!"`
`Gohda wasn't an idiot either.`
` Even if he couldn't fully understand what was going on, he at least realized that if this "Kanon" wasn't seized, his own life would also be in peril.`
`He sprung at Kanon with his huge body, pushing him up against the wall with his weight and physical strength.`
`"Uuuoooooooooooooooooohhh...! Ooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"Let...me...go, you fatass!!"`
`The tips of the fingers on Kanon's right hand began to trace out another purple trail.`
`And when he raised that blade‐hand up, aiming to strike at Gohda's back, there was a loud thunk.`
`Because Kanon's raised blade‐hand had been pinned to the wall.`
`He couldn't tear his palm away from the wall.`
`Sticking out from it was the knife Genji had thrown.`
`Under normal circumstances, it should have been surprising to see someone as old as Genji handle a knife so skillfully,`
` but in this abnormal space, no one paid it much mind.`
`"Genji‐sama, here...!"`
`"......Yes."`
`Genji took the handkerchief with the spiderweb stuck to it from Shannon.`
`{n}And he approached Kanon, who was pinned to the wall by Gohda's massive body and the knife.`
`"Sto‐stop it...!!`
` Don't co—Don't come near me with that...!!`
` Stop it, sto‐stop!!"`
`"Gyaooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`When Genji pushed the handkerchief up against Kanon's face,`
` ...there was a sound just like the one you hear when you set meat on a red‐hot iron plate.`
`Of course, the smell was the same too.`
` As he was burned and inflamed, festering in filthy red and black, and cried out in his death throes, Kanon's body burst open and scattered.`
`It was almost as though a balloon filled with gold leaf had popped.`
`{n}The entire servant room was completely buried under a storm of gold leaf—no, a rabble of gold butterflies...`
`Those butterflies began to softly fade into nothingness, as though dissolving into water, no, into the air itself,`
` ......and afterwards, all that was left was the three of them sitting on their behinds, stained with blood.`
`However, not everyone was just stained with blood.`
`{n}Some of them were lying on the ground, vomiting blood themselves.`
`"...Kumasawa...!`
` ......Doctor Nanjo...!`
` ....................."`
`A slit so sharp that it looked like it could cut your finger if you touched it was opened wide, causing large amounts of blood to keep pouring out...`
`"What was that, .........j‐...just now............"`
`"..........................."`
`".........Gohda.`
` Have you been injured?"`
`"I, I am alright...`
` But.........what did we see?!`
` What happened?!`
` E‐ev‐ev‐......even though I definitely pushed that thing against this wall with this very hand!"`
`"{i:I cannot understand what happened}...!!"`
`Gohda looked at his own hand.`
`The bright‐red blood left from his scuffle with Kanon...definitely remained.`
`...And yet, Kanon was nowhere to be seen.`
`Because he had disappeared.`
`{n}He had turned into gold butterflies and scattered.`
`Gohda kept screaming alone that he had no clue about what was going on.`
`Shannon sobbed in front of Nanjo's and Kumasawa's remains,`
` ...and Genji watched over her, silent as always...`
