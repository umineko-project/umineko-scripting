`"................................."`
`Rosa woke up from her doze.`
`......It must have been a very deep sleep.`
`{n}Her mind was fuzzy and she wasn't thinking clearly.`
`Where was she...`
`{n}It felt like some mansion, but at least it didn't seem to be the Ushiromiya family mansion.`
`She was in a room that looked like a parlor.`
`......And there was some tea that had been prepared.`
`{n}It had almost certainly been prepared for her.`
`Sparkles like gold leaf were dancing around the room, and it looked very dreamlike.`
`...She eventually realized that they were gold butterflies, which made that stand out even more.`
`There was someone across from her.`
`......Female.`
` ......A lady.`
`.........The witch...`
`of the portrait.`
`She looked like she was having a one‐sided conversation.`
`She was probably talking to Rosa,`
` but Rosa's mind was clouded up by a deep fog, and she didn't have a clue what was being said...`
`"......It can be anything.`
` If there is anything you desire, I will give you it all.`
` You may think of it as a reward for your good luck, or as a proper trade for my demands."`
`"To you, it may not be that great a thing at all.`
` But that is how significant this transaction is to me."`
`............What is she...talking about.`
`...I don't know,`
` ...I don't know.`
`"Only, ......considering that I {i:am} a witch,`
` I think it would be wise to ask for something that only a witch can grant."`
`"Isn't this a rare chance.`
` You can actually receive a favor from me, {f:5:Beatrice} the Golden.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"........................u........."`
`Finally, Rosa started to feel the blood flowing through her body.`
`{n}...Her movements were still sluggish, and she couldn't even voice the words she was thinking.`
`"I am commonly called the Golden Witch.`
` Bestowing a mountain of gold, like I gave to Kinzo, is no problem for me.`
` ......After all, every pleasure of the human world can be expressed in terms of cash.`
` Put another way, gold is human pleasure itself."`
`"Can you imagine?`
` A mountain of gold that you couldn't use up as long as you lived."`
`The witch blew on her pipe, and seven colors of smoke covered the area.`
`When she did, the inside of the parlor...had suddenly become filled with stacks of gold ingots.`
`It looked like a shining gold‐colored wall.`
`...If each ingot was worth tens of millions of yen,`
` how much would all of this be worth?`
`It seemed sinful to even think of that number.`
`"......However, the human world is difficult.`
` I know that there are some things that cannot be satisfied no matter how high into the sky you pile up gold.`
` I know that there are cracks that can't be filled."`
`"I won't make light of that, and in fact, I believe that is why this is a gift that only a witch such as I can give."`
`"......Why don't I fill those cracks in for you?`
` Yes, how about this.`
` It's something that only I can give.`
` You should be very happy."`
`"......You don't have to say it out loud.`
` I can understand it right away, the cracks in your heart are written on your face, *cackle*cackle*!"`
`Rosa felt a touch of discomfort at this witch,`
` who kept on talking even though she herself hadn't uttered a single word,`
` but since she still couldn't speak well, and found it difficult even to move a finger, she could do nothing about it,`
` and was unable to do anything but listen.`
`"How far back must I trace the deep wounds in your heart in order to heal them?"`
`"......This is...`
`...deep,`
` deep.`
` ......Sometimes, wounds close up while a fragment of something is still inside.`
` ...Even when those wounds appear to have healed, they will continue to throb for all eternity.`
` Sometimes you have to open the wound once to completely heal it."`
`As the witch spoke, she was staring deep into Rosa's eyes.`
`......What in the world...was she peering at?`
` Rosa felt uncomfortable, but she couldn't look away.`
`"............So this pain of yours was preordained from your very birth.`
` ...How heart‐breaking.`
` ...You don't have to say it.`
` I understand.`
` ......I understand......"`
`Gradually, Rosa, in turn, was drawn into the witch's eyes.`
`Gradually, the world grew dark, spinning round and round as she was sucked in...`
`Rosa, Rosa.`
` Why are you such an idiot?`
`Oh, that's Krauss nii‐san's voice.`
`{n}Krauss nii‐san is very grown‐up, so he's very smart.`
`{n}So he hated the stupid kid Rosa.`
`And he was a very scary person, and I was often hit, and my toys were taken from me and broken.`
`He would say it was a punishment because I did something bad, but I didn't really understand what that was, or why I was being punished.`
`I was always punished suddenly, and then after the fact, I was told in a contrived manner that it was a punishment for something or other,`
` but it was always something I didn't remember doing.`
`......So I really hated Krauss nii‐san.`
`Rosa, Rosa.`
` Why are you such an idiot?`
`Oh, that's Eva nee‐san's voice.`
`{n}Eva nee‐san is very grown‐up, so she's very smart.`
`{n}So she hated the stupid kid Rosa.`
`And she was a very sly person, and I was often lied to, tricked, and bullied a lot.`
`She would say it was because I was stupid, and that it was only natural for stupid people to be swindled by those smarter than them.`
`So I wanted to become a wise person like Eva nee‐san, and listened to what she said, but when I obeyed her, for some reason, someone always got really mad at me.`
`......So I really hated Eva nee‐san.`
`Rosa, Rosa.`
` Why are you such an idiot?`
`Oh, that's Rudolf nii‐san's voice.`
`{n}Rudolf nii‐san is very shrewd.`
`{n}So he hated the stupid kid Rosa.`
`When Krauss nii‐san was around, he was friendly with Krauss nii‐san.`
`{n}When Eva nee‐san was around, he was friendly with Eva nee‐san.`
`...And when Krauss nii‐san wasn't around, he was violent like Krauss nii‐san,`
` and when Eva nee‐san wasn't around, he played dirty like Eva nee‐san.`
`And even though he too was bullied most of the time,`
` when Krauss nii‐san and Eva nee‐san weren't around, he gave me two people's worth of bullying.`
`......So I really hated Rudolf nii‐san.`
`......Oh, but these are my memories from when I was a kid.`
`Quite a lot of unfair things happen when you're a kid.`
`{n}And you can't drag them out forever.`
`In time, you bury them away in the far reaches of memory, and forget them bit by bit; that is supposed to be what it means to grow up, and become an adult.`
`So becoming an adult is the same thing as separating yourself from all of those memories.`
`And so.`
` No matter how much time passed, Rosa couldn't become an adult.`
`......Even though she had been blessed with a daughter called Maria and was called a mother,`
` ...she didn't at all feel like she had become an adult.`
`The witch pitied that.`
`And she smiled, saying that she could heal that pain herself.`
`"......How to heal you.`
` It's possible, but not easy.`
` ...I could even rewind time, and give you a world where you have no elder siblings."`
`"But that way, your "memories of being hurt by your elder siblings" wouldn't remain,`
` and therefore, you would be unable to acknowledge it as a reward."`
`"It is the relieving of hunger that brings satisfaction.`
` If you erase hunger itself, no one will thank you.`
` Just like how there are no young people who give thanks for their daily gluttony.`
` ......Understand?"`
`I think she just told me something really difficult.`
`...In short, even if she makes it so that I never had elder siblings, the pain wouldn't be removed,`
` maybe that's what she's saying.`
`Strictly speaking, it's different.`
`{n}Healing isn't the same thing as removing pain.`
`{n}It's the pleasure earned for withstanding pain.`
`Therefore, there can be no healing without pain.`
`{n}To know the joy of healing, you have to know the pain.`
`"In that case, ......you will require joy that compensates for your pain.`
` You can feel proud of the past you have suffered.`
` Because you are qualified to know a kind of pleasure that those who have not known suffering cannot taste.`
` ...Those that have known this pleasure cannot help but give the same joy to others...`
` *cackle*cackle*..."`
`The witch snapped her fingers, and even though the room was still filled with a mountain of gold,`
` and was already like something from another world, a fabulous tablecloth appeared on top of the table,`
` and wonderful cooking was laid out, almost as though it was the opening of a banquet in a castle from some fairy tale.`
`For an instant, Rosa felt a pleasurable surprise at how fabulous it was,`
` ...but at the same time, she felt a bit of anticlimax.`
`Because she found herself thinking that being bullied by her siblings...`
`couldn't be wiped away by just one meal, no matter how delicious.`
`"Food contains many of the human pleasures.`
` You must eat like a pig as long as you live."`
`"If one meal isn't enough, then as many as you want.`
` Let us continue this gourmet banquet until the pain of your heart is healed.`
` ......Begin, furniture."`
`As the witch clapped twice,`
` there were suddenly goat‐head servants there, and they began to prepare the meal.`
`From the beautiful food dishes adorning the table, they efficiently took some food and began to pile it up on Rosa's plate.`
`It really did look delicious, but Rosa's body still felt as heavy as lead,`
` and there was no way she could eat.`
`Maybe they also understood that.`
`The goat‐head servants tied a napkin around Rosa's collar,`
` and gallantly brought a glass of before‐dinner alcohol to her mouth, and even tilted it for her.`
`She remembered an old servant who had once carried rice porridge to her mouth when she was laid up with a high fever.`
`She couldn't drink it well, and it dripped down from her mouth, but she felt the fragrant sweetness spread throughout her mouth.`
`"It's a sweet aperitif of noble rot German‐made wine.`
` A wine cocktail of white wine tinged with crimson golden drops."`
`"If I had to give it a name, I'd call it a Bloody Krauss.`
` The color comes solely from golden drops of your brother's blood, obtained by placing him in a compressor."`
`"Bghk......?! *cough*, *cough*......!!"`
`Rosa coughed violently.`
` And the bright red that stained her face made it look as though she had coughed up blood.`
`"You know a lot about black tea, so you should know what it means, right?`
` "Golden drop" refers to the last drop.`
` It is called the most precious drop in black tea."`
`".........So a golden drop of blood is the same.`
` The last and most precious drop of blood squeezed out of a human.`
` It's squeezed with that."`
`As the witch snapped her fingers, a bright red veil was pulled off something large which had not been there moments ago.`
`......The solemn and massive machine there was just like...`
`a coffin for a large‐sized person, with many large bulb‐like things stuck to it,`
` and it looked like a sinister torture device.`
`By its unnerving shape,`
` you could tell that it used manpower to tighten and compress something.`
`...And it seemed that there were still some squeezed dregs remaining inside,`
` because of the bright red remains that stained it.`
`"But you can't take more than one golden drop at once.`
` No matter what kind of human you take it from, you can't get more than one drop.`
` But I am a witch.`
` It is also easy to revive a person."`
`When the witch snapped her fingers, suddenly, the human compressor began to shake.`
` ...No, you could also hear a groan.`
`......It looked almost as though someone had been sleeping in that man‐sized coffin,`
` had woken up, and was now struggling to get out.`
`But that was wrong.`
`{n}What was inside had definitely {i:been squeezed dregs}.`
`Using her magic, the witch had once again revived the squeezed dregs to how they had been before they were squeezed.`
`Three goat‐head servants with muscular physiques approached the compressor, and forcefully started tightening the large bulbs.`
`...As they did, an unearthly moan came from the inside of the coffin.`
`{n}...Rosa thought she knew the owner of that voice.`
`"It is fitting for cooking to be done in the kitchen.`
` That is enough, stand back."`
`"......Do you understand now how precious a golden drop is?`
` To have it stained this crimson requires that {i:several dozen people's worth} be squeezed."`
`The witch had definitely said that only one golden drop could be taken from a single human.`
`And yet, she had dozens of people's worth of golden drops from a single human.`
`{n}......Only a witch could do this.`
`The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} could kill a single human "endlessly".`
`......In other words, before {f:5:Beatrice}, even death did not mean release.`
`"Want a second sip?`
` Have you forgotten the day this man hit you, and you swallowed the blood that ran into your mouth?"`
`"That's right, remember that taste.`
` Remember the taste of the tears that you spilled until you were dry.`
` I believe this aperitif will be sufficient to heal that regrettable memory.`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`Once again, the goat‐head servants tilted the deep red glass against her mouth.`
`...Rosa attempted to close her lips in resistance,`
` but the deep red liquid was relentlessly poured into her mouth, which was hanging open with shock,`
` and the inside of her mouth was filled with a ghastly sweetness...`
`It was definitely a fragrant sweetness.`
`Her brother, who she had thought of so hatefully, and who had made her soak her pillow so many times,`
` had died dozens of times over to tinge this wine crimson, so it must have tasted sweet.`
`But Rosa tried to spit it out.`
`Because of that, the deep red wine that spilled out of Rosa's mouth made her look as if she was covered in blood.`
`......If this ghastly substance was only the aperitif,`
` Rosa couldn't help but feel uncomfortable about what would happen if this banquet continued.`
`"That is a forked‐tongued salad made from vegetables in season.`
` ...On your ninth birthday, you wished you could bite it off someday—so here is that salad you desired, made from Eva's tongue."`
`"........................!!!"`
`When Rosa heard the true nature of the pink‐colored meat piled up in the salad,`
` she had a sudden impulse to vomit her guts out.`
`...Furthermore, the goat servants stuck a fork in it, and carried it to Rosa's mouth.`
`"How does your sister's forked tongue taste?`
` It must be quite soft and enchanting, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`How sweet, soft and enchanting it must have tasted in her mouth.`
`After all, Eva's lies were always sweet, and young Rosa had always listened to them.`
`...So you could say that the taste of the stimulating pepper seasoning that had been added expressed the details of those lies well.`
`"......mnnnnnnnnnnn!!`
` mnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!"`
`Rosa spat out the tongue salad that kept being pushed into her mouth, covering it with saliva.`
`But the goat‐head servants carefully returned it to the plate and carried it to Rosa's mouth over and over again.`
`"It goes without saying, but I made this salad generously using five of Eva's tongues.`
` You can't steal more than one tongue out of one person.`
` But I can steal it over and over.`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`".........nnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!`
` nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!"`
`As Rosa's tears dripped down, she resisted, half‐crazed.`
`{n}However, the only way she could resist was by refusing to swallow.`
`Even if she didn't swallow it,`
` the taste of the french dressing increasingly violated Rosa's mouth...`
`"Is it not to your satisfaction...?`
` There's still much more food.`
` Sea bass pie wrapped in the skin of Rudolf's face.`
` Soup with boiled brains, liver pate.`
` And look forward to dessert, *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"It's not just your siblings, see?`
` I have lavishly arranged all of those who you have trusted and yet betrayed you.`
` Why don't we continue this banquet for all eternity, until your heart is satisfied.`
` For all eternity."`
`"......You're happy, riiiight, Ushiromiya Rosaaaa?`
` Don't pretend that you hate it I know that you're really happy alriiight?`
` If you want to laugh, then laugh,`
` if you won't feel better until you've heard a live performance of your annoying elder siblings' screams, then I'll let you hear them as often as you want."`
`"It's alright that you are so unwilling.`
` That's your personality, isn't it?`
` You're actually so happy that your skin is crawling all over.`
` And yet, on the outside, you're just pretending to act like you're in pain, aren't youuu?"`
`"It's alright, there is no need to worry about honor or your public image or anything here,`
` so laugh as much as you want and chew it to bits.`
` Isn't this the bessst banquet, Ushiromiya Rosaaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaaaa???"`
`".........st‐`
` .........please,`
` ......stop......`
`...*cough*, *hack*!!`
` uweghhh..."`
`"Oh, I'm sorry, I was keeping the dessert a secret to surprise you, but let me reveal it anyways.`
` If I reveal it, maybe that will be enough incentive for you to eat up the full course."`
`"The dessert is that beloved daughter that you had to keep pretending to love,`
` oven‐baked Maria and apples.`
` Doesn't that sound yummyyyy?"`
`"If you eat this, you will be released from everything.`
` Freedom, you see, freedom!`
` Finally Rosa will gain freedom as an individual person, aren't you happyyyy{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}yyyyyy?`
` Of course you are, drool is hanging from your mouth, just try looking in a mirroooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooooor, hyaha{0}haaa{0}haa{0}haa{0}haha!!"`
`Suddenly, a muscular goat‐head cook was holding Maria under his arm.`
`And Maria gazed at Rosa with a face that was just slightly sad.`
`"............Mama...`
` ......Was I......a burden......?"`
`"...nnnnnnn!`
` You aren't a burden!!`
` nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!"`
`As Rosa spat out the food that was continually being carried to her mouth,`
` as she was covered with mess and saliva and blood, she resisted filthily and screamed.`
`"......If you...`
`think I'm a burden, Mama,`
` ......I'm fine being eaten."`
`".........After all, I always do horrible things to you, Mama.`
` Even when you brought a man over, I couldn't stay quiet.`
` When you stayed over with a man, I got lonely and unruly and made a mess of the room."`
`"When I went to search by myself, I got lost, the police had to pick me up and I brought shame on you, Mama.`
` When you didn't come home for days, I cried and had to be cheered up by the neighbors, and brought shame on you again, Mama."`
`"Because I'm like this, I cause trouble for you, Mama.`
` I'm sorry for being born.`
` So I'll become delicious oven‐baked apples for you, Mama."`
`"And then, maybe I can make you happy I exist for the first time.`
` Maybe, if you eat me and you think I'm delicious."`
`"She will be, riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight?`
` Be choked up with tears of gratitude your daughter is saying this much for you seeeeeee?`
` Oven‐baked apples and your beloved daughter make for the best dessert!`
` You've managed to raise such delicious ingredients,`
` aren't you the best mother, Ushiromiya Rosaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaaaaa???"`
`".........Mama, thanks for everything.`
` Bye bye."`
`"Wait!!`
` Wait, Maria, that's wrong!!`
` Stop it already, stop it already,`
` noooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooooo!!`
` I didn't want something like this!"`
`"Please stop, please let me go!!`
` No,`
` stop it already,`
` don't put it...in my mouth...`
` uuuuulg,`
` gweeeeeeeeeeeeehh!!"`
`"Have you found my hospitality to your satisfaction...?`
` Then I'll have you accept it.`
` That I am a witch.`
` Proclaim it.`
` Proclaim that "Ushiromiya Rosa accepts that {f:5:Beatrice} is a witch"!!"`
`"......I accept it!!`
` U‐Ushiromiya Rosa...`
`...accepts that B‐{f:5:Beatrice}...`
`...is a witch!!`
` So give Maria back!!`
` Release meeeeeee{-}e{-}e{-}eeeee!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*, hahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!!`
` I finally made you accept it!!`
` That smart‐alecky Battler has already submitted, and now I've made even Rosa accept it, the fool who denied me after being invited to the Golden Land!!`
` Perfect!!`
` <It's perfect!!>"`
`"I've accomplished my perfect victory!!`
` *cackle*, haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hakya‐HAH‐HAH‐HAH‐HAH‐HAH‐HA!!`
` Now, take Maria away, prepare a delicious oven roast for Rosa!!"`
`"Nooooooooooooooooooooooo, Mariaaaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaaaaa!!"`
`"Looks delicious.`
` Slice up your cow tits and make me a sandwich."`
`"Wha‐......th‐that voice!!`
` Ooof?!"`
`An arm grabbed the back of the witch's head and smashed her face into the table.`
`As it did, the witch broke to pieces, turned into a group of gold butterflies, and reformed into her body a short distance away.`
`"Ba‐.........Battler?!?!`
` Y‐......you cursed man,`
` ...I, I thought you became furniture, that you submitted down to your very soul!!"`
`"I thought I did too.`
` ...But while I was listening to your gross recipes, I started to get a little hungry."`
`"Now I feel like eating a whole roast witch!!"`
`"And Maria.`
` It's ten years too early for you to talk about having someone eat you.`
` But in ten years, you have to say that to me. Promise."`
`"......Uu.`
` Promise."`
`"Ba‐...Battler‐kun...!"`
`"Sorry to keep you waiting, Auntie Rosa.`
` I had forgotten.`
` This was a one‐on‐one fight between me and this woman.`
` I was never supposed to give in.`
` ......Thanks to your persistence, I've regained my will to fight!!"`
`......Th‐...this man, he was broken to the depths of his soul, and capitulated to me...`
`......I see, he doesn't know when to give up, just what I'd expect from Ushiromiya Kinzo's grandson...!`
` So the chick of a phoenix is a phoenix after all...!`
`"Fu...fuhahahahahahahahaha, how vigorous, I like it!`
` I wouldn't have it any other way!!"`
`"That is exactly what I expect from you, Ushiromiya Battler!!`
` Try to deny me, I'll completely and thoroughly smash you to bits!`
` I will break you over and over again, and I'll teach you, one who has licked my shoes, the taste of defeat over and over!!"`
`"No problem, I'll teach you that I, Ushiromiya Battler, am a man who'll stand back up even after crawling in the mud!!"`
`"I've never had the experience of being invincible in a fight.`
` I've lost many times."`
`"But I always crawl through the mud and stand up again.`
` And I always finish what I started!!`
` In a man's fight, you don't lose until you accept defeat, no matter how much you get beat up!!"`
`"Don't think I'm out just because you took a shot at me.`
` Entertain me, {f:5:Beatriceeeeeeeeeeeee}!!"`
`"I'll accept your challenge, Ushiromiya Battler!!`
` Furniture, begin preparations for the next game!!"`
`"And while we're waiting, I have much I want to hear from you!`
` There were many locked rooms in this game.`
` Using red, I've smashed to bits most of the methods by which you tried to talk yourself out.`
` What other evasive quibbles will you show me now?!!"`
`"The lock to the chapel, the lock to Jessica's room, the lock to the servant room, the lock to Natsuhi's room, the lock to the parlor!!`
` Use all those things you humans are so good at pulling out of the blue,`
` your delusions, rantings, daydreams, bluffs,`
` all slanted with ridiculous, incredible turns of events, and show how you can thoroughly deny meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!"`
`"Aaah, it's no good,`
` it's no goddamn good at aaaaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaaaaaallllll!!!"`
