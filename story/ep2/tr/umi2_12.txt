`...Rosa and the rest returned from the chapel to the parlor in the mansion.`
`{n}Such a horrific thing had happened so early in the morning.`
`{n}Of course they were high‐strung...`
`Battler and George—who had cried, raged, and let their emotions explode after seeing their parents' tragic bodies—`
`returned to the parlor, sat on the sofas, and let their minds go blank, as though everything up until then had been a lie...`
`Only Maria was completely unchanged, and looked just like normal.`
`......When she wasn't being mischievous, she was basically a kid who played wordlessly by herself,`
` so even if her mind was blank, she would probably look as she did.`
`...But as she turned on the TV and flipped through the channels, it looked as though nothing about her had changed from normal.`
`Perhaps Rosa had some opinions about this attitude, which was clearly different from normal people.`
`......She stared at Maria's back with a gaze that wasn't quite pleasant.`
`Eventually, Kumasawa came to say good morning.`
` ...Her cheerful manner was clearly out of place, and she couldn't help but be bewildered at the strange atmosphere in the room.`
`......Then, she heard the details from Gohda, and expressed her shock in a truly noisy manner.`
`"O‐o‐o‐of course you've contacted the police, right...?!`
` What should we do in a time like this, oooh, what should we do...?!"`
`".........Please listen calmly.`
` ...It seems that some kind of apparatus was done in by lightning last night.`
` Because of that, we have become unable to use the telephones..."`
`"Huuuh?!!`
` Th‐then, until the typhoon passes, we can't even contact the police?!"`
`Maybe Kumasawa's exaggerated surprise was a little comical.`
`Rosa giggled, in spite of the situation.`
`......Because of that, the fog of confusion that had covered her head cleared up a little.`
`".........I've got to stay strong.`
` ......It's not just Maria.`
` ......I'm acting as a parent for George‐kun and Battler‐kun too now, so I have to stay strong......"`
`Rosa had been the youngest sibling, with a large difference in age between her and the others.`
`{n}So she was always treated as a child.`
`Every time she learned something new, it was something obvious to her brothers and sister,`
` and she had grown a complex, thinking that she must be incompetent.`
`So she had formed a passive attitude, asking her brothers and sister for advice every time something happened...`
`.........But she no longer had any brothers or sisters.`
`{n}Now, Rosa was the only one of the four Ushiromiya siblings left.`
`...Furthermore, if Kinzo continued to shut himself away even in this extraordinary situation,`
` ......Rosa would have to surpass this crisis as the representative of the head.`
`"...............I'm not a child anymore, not a child.`
` ................................."`
`...Rosa slapped her knees lightly and stood up.`
`She must not wait for orders now.`
`{n}...She had to start moving herself.`
`She picked up the receiver to the extension phone on the side table.`
`{n}......Then she immediately remembered that the telephones were out of order.`
`Genji and Shannon, who she had sent to see Kinzo, hadn't returned yet.`
`...She had a general guess.`
` He was probably yelling about something nonsensical again, and they were unable to calm him.`
`...His important chapel had been defiled with blood.`
`{n}That was easy to imagine.`
`She had planned on using the extension phone to call the study, but with the telephone line dead, there was nothing else for it.`
`Rosa decided to go to the study directly, with her own two feet.`
`Her old self would have been so frightened that she wouldn't have been able to go see Kinzo.`
`...And in fact, if she did meet him, she would probably be blamed for something and abused.`
`But now wasn't the time to be frightened.`
` .........As his true daughter, she had to make him aware of the current situation.`
`"......Kumasawa‐san,`
` I'm going to see Father.`
` ...Take special care of George‐kun and Battler‐kun.`
` ......I'm sure they are on edge right now."`
`"Yes, yes...`
` I am quite sure they must be...`
` ...It is truly pitiable...`
` I shall make them something warm to drink."`
`"Thank you."`
`Rosa went out into the hallway, and headed towards Kinzo's study.`
`The atmosphere in this mansion, which she had spent her younger days in and should have been full of memories, seemed somehow different...`
`And she began to climb the stairs in the entrance hall...`
`......Just then.`
` In the gloom down the stairs behind Rosa, ...something glowed.`
`It was a single fluttering gold butterfly.`
`{n}...It fluttered around and sparkled.`
`{n}That butterfly quietly danced without a sound.`
`......Obviously.`
` No one can hear the sound of a butterfly's wings beating.`
`.........And then, ......it stopped on Rosa's back as she slowly climbed the stairs.`
`Rosa didn't notice.`
` And to an ignorant observer, it would probably have looked just as though a single sheet of gold leaf in the shape of a butterfly had gotten stuck there.`
`Without noticing, Rosa continued heading to Kinzo's study......`
`".........Wellll then, in what way should I entertain myself next?`
` ...There are still many, many pieces left.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`In the parlor, which had returned to silence, the only sound was that of the TV, which Maria was watching alone.`
`If there was anything audible other than that, it was the sound of the rain which had continued on and on since last night.`
`Every one of those people who had viewed that unearthly and horrible scene stayed silent, as though praying that the events of this morning were all a dream.`
`Only Kumasawa hadn't seen it, and so acted slightly differently.`
`...She instead found this silence difficult to bear, and was fidgety with the desire to cheer everyone up.`
`...However, unable to say more than she should, it seemed that she was racking her brains as to how she could be of some use...`
`Normally it would be time for breakfast.`
` ......However, maybe because something like that had happened, Gohda seemed to have forgotten about preparing a meal.`
`...No, maybe everyone was so beaten up that they had forgotten their hunger.`
`Kumasawa wanted to bring up the subject of what they would do for breakfast, but it didn't seem like the right atmosphere, so she really couldn't.`
`But it was difficult being hungry.`
`{n}...So, she casually made a proposal.`
`"...I imagine you all must be tired after all that has happened.`
` ......In times like this, I think the best thing is to heat yourself with some warm black tea."`
`"......Mm, that is a good plan.`
` I agree as well."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` How about some delicious black tea with biscuits and jam?`
` Oh yes, yes, it seems that it's near Halloween—there were some delicious‐looking pumpkin‐shaped cookies on the shelf..."`
`"......Ah, Kumasawa‐san, that's........."`
`Of course, she had said the wrong thing.`
` ...Because she had reminded Battler and the rest about that horrible and tragic Halloween party in the chapel...`
`Nanjo hurriedly whispered into Kumasawa's ear.`
`".........................................."`
`"......Battler‐san, I am truly sorry!`
` ...I didn't mean anything bad, gracious, no..."`
`"No, don't worry about it.`
` .........I'll definitely turn this boiling anger back on the culprit."`
`".........I wonder if that culprit is still on the island."`
`"Probably.`
` After all, there's not gonna be a boat coming until the typhoon passes."`
`"Ye‐...yes, my goodness!`
` Because the boats don't come even if there is a little wind.`
` They certainly wouldn't be able to ride one during a typhoon, good gracious no!"`
`"......It creeps me out."`
`"You think so too, Aniki?`
` Me too.`
` .........Regardless of whether the culprit was that mystery guest or not."`
`"That's right.`
` ......We are naturally suspecting the mysterious guest who calls herself {f:5:Beatrice},`
` but we still cannot be sure that she is the culprit.`
` ...There is still the possibility she's a {i:victim whose corpse still hasn't been found}."`
`"......When I think of it that way, there's something I just can't understand."`
`"What do you......mean by that......?"`
`"It's simple.`
` It's just like Kumasawa baa‐chan said a short while ago.`
` Right now, this island is right in the midst of the typhoon, and escape is impossible.`
` The same thing goes for the culprit.`
` .........In that case, having the crime come to light should have been the thing that the culprit most wanted to avoid."`
`"......That's right.`
` ...There was no need to draw that creepy magic circle on the entrance to the chapel, and show off the fact that the corpses were there."`
`"Right, exactly that.`
` Furthermore, if they were able to take the time and effort to do something so horrible to those six,`
` ......it should have been equally possible for them to hide the six corpses where they would be impossible to find."`
`"I agree. That brutal Halloween party probably wasn't directed at those who died.`
` ......It was directed at the people who would eventually discover it: us.`
` You could probably claim that the magic circle was there to show it to us."`
`"...The culprit knew that they wouldn't be able to get away from this island for a while.`
` ......And yet, they acted as though they wanted to make us find the corpses in the middle of this typhoon."`
`"......What...does this mean?`
` ...If I was the culprit, I definitely wouldn't play around and make us find the corpses."`
`"............{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama was not in her room.`
` ...The room did not seem particularly disturbed.`
` ......Ah, no, Milady did disturb it quite a lot though..."`
`"...Come to think of it, what happened to Jessica?"`
`"Kanon‐san is looking after her.`
` ...They are probably in Milady's room."`
`"............That isn't good.`
` ...The culprit is definitely still on the island.`
` ......In this situation, I don't believe it's a very good idea to isolate ourselves in small numbers."`
`"Wh‐what do you mean by that...?`
` Y‐y‐you don't mean to say that the culprit plans to kill all of us...?!`
` Awawa{0}wa{0}wa{0}wa{0}wawawa..."`
`"Let us remain calm...`
` That is not yet certain..."`
`"But we can't deny the possibility, much to my chagrin. Ihihi."`
`"......This letter was in the chapel.`
` According to this, the culprit is the witch,`
` and if we don't solve the riddle of Grandfather's epitaph and find the gold, she'll massacre the whole family...or something like that."`
`"Is that true...!`
` Umm, would you allow me to read it as well...?"`
`"Hii...{0}hi...{0}hi...{0}hieee{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}eeee...{0}eeee{0}e{0}e{0}eeee...{0}hh..."`
`"......mmmmmmmgh......"`
`As they read the witch's letter, Gohda, Kumasawa, and Nanjo's faces grew even paler than they had been...`
`Kumasawa could no longer hide her shaking.`
`".........If you don't want to die, try finding Grandfather's hidden gold, huh.`
` ...Screwing around with us.`
` I'll bet you can't solve the riddle, so you're trying to make us solve it...!"`
`"However, ...I wonder what the truth is.`
` Madam always insisted that the Legend of the Gold was nothing more than a fantasy created by the Master.`
` ......It is doubtful whether that actually existed..."`
`"True...`
` Supposedly, they thought it would be nice if it existed, but only somewhat believed it.`
` ......The relatives only all started believing in the Legend of the Gold after Kinzo's health worsened and the inheritance problem came up.`
` I would think that there were very few people who believed it before then."`
`"...Really? I wonder if that's why.`
` Do you remember?`
` On the table in the chapel.`
` ...There were three gold ingots.`
` That alone is worth quite a lot.`
` Couldn't that truly prove that the Legend of the Gold was real?"`
`"E‐...excuse me, ...please wait.`
` Just now, did you say three gold bars......?"`
`"......Yeah, there were definitely three of them piled up.`
` So what?"`
`"Well, umm, I, .........happened to hear Krauss‐sama talking about it once.`
` ......Yes, I just heard it, you understand?!`
` It's not like I was trying to listen to his discussions in secret, gracious no!"`
`"Don't worry about that now.`
` So then what?`
` Is there something wrong with there being three of those gold bars?"`
`"...Y‐yes.`
` According to Krauss‐sama, ...there was only one bar ever found to support the Legend of the Gold."`
`"......That is correct.`
` I do believe the story goes that Kinzo‐san showed the president of Marusoo a mountain of gold, and let him take one bar back with him."`
`"And that one came to be in Krauss‐sama's possession.`
` And he said this as well.`
` That there was no gold which supported the Master's legend besides that one..."`
`"You're talking about my uncle here, right?`
` So what have we got here?`
` ......No wait, ......three?!`
` Wait, wait, where did they come from, that's too many of them!"`
`"Might we not think of it this way?`
` Maybe the other people in the family each found one, and they each brought one of them there..."`
`"No, I cannot believe that.`
` When all of the relatives came to the mansion, I was entrusted with their luggage.`
` I did not feel any suspicious weight back then."`
`"......I think they weighed about ten kilograms.`
` If that much weight was in their bags, even I would notice.`
` But it didn't seem that way."`
`"Same here.`
` At the most, there were some changes of clothes, medicine, Kyrie‐san's makeup.`
` That's about it, I think.`
` Auntie Rosa's luggage also looked pretty light."`
`"......In that case, those three piled up gold bars were being shown to them, ...or maybe us.`
` ......Telling us that the Legend of the Gold is definitely real.`
` That it isn't a fantasy.`
` And challenging us to uncover it."`
`"Could there be a scheme...to have us solve the epitaph which points to the hidden location, and then try to snatch it away?"`
`"............That does fit best.`
` ...But there are a few parts that don't make sense.`
` First, our parents, who should have been the most likely to be able to solve the epitaph, were killed first.`
` I think that creates an immediate contradiction."`
`".........And something else makes even less sense.`
` ......They're trying to say that the Legend of the Gold is actually true,`
` {i:but how could they prepare that gold}?`
` ......It's almost like the culprit has already found the gold,`
` and is telling us to try and find it too."`
`"Maybe the culprit obtained those three like Uncle Krauss and thereby became certain about the Legend of the Gold,`
` and is trying to make us search for the rest... I think that way is the most convincing."`
`"...........................`
` ......The pieces on the chessboard aren't lining up at all.`
` ............We don't have a clue what the culprit is planning, what they want, what they want to make us do.`
` ............Is it pointless?`
` Thinking about anything, at this point in time.`
` ..........................."`
`"......Kihihi.`
` It was written down.`
` What she wants you to do.`
` Can't any of you read? Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi."`
`Maria suddenly laughed in a creepy voice.`
`...I'd thought she'd been concentrating on the TV, but she'd been listening in too, apparently.`
`As she remained facing the TV, ...she very simply told us what we were forgetting.`
`"{f:5:Beatrice} hasn't said one word about wanting the gold.`
` ......She's not asked anything except whether you can solve the epitaph's riddle or not."`
`"...Although I bet she thinks it'll be impossible for you anyway.`
` ......Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi."`
`"......So you're saying you can solve it, Maria?"`
`"...Don't caaare.`
` She's going to take me to the Golden Land, so.`
` Won't get in {f:5:Beatrice}'s way.`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi,`
` ouch."`
`"Looks like if we wanna understand further, we're gonna have to ask Maria.`
` ...Maria, tell us.`
` ...............Who is this {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` What is she planning?"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!`
` Well, you see, {f:5:Beatrice} is a witch!`
` She can do anything with her wondrous powers."`
`"Anything can be done with the power of magic.`
` You can create gold, you can create bread.`
` And of course, you can even create sweets!`
` You saw it, didn't you?`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!"`
`"......hn?"`
`At that time, everyone jumped at the sound of a door being closed forcefully.`
`We turned around to find that at some point Rosa had returned, bringing Genji and Shannon.`
`......Then she rapidly approached Maria, her heels clacking, and hit her sharply on the cheek.`
`"......Stop talking about that.`
` Battler‐kun and the rest will take it badly."`
`"..................Uu..."`
`Without waiting for a response, she slapped Maria's cheek once more.`
`{n}Everyone could only stand there, shocked.`
`"I don't know what "uu" means.`
` What about yes?"`
`"...............Uu."`
`She mercilessly slapped Maria's cheek again.`
`......Maybe she didn't feel like resisting after being hit twice.`
`Maria weakly said yes.`
`"Ro‐......Rosa‐san, there was no reason to do something so harsh..."`
`"...This is my daughter's education.`
` I would greatly appreciate it if you didn't interject."`
`The atmosphere around Rosa, with Genji and Shannon in tow, was somehow cold, and yet dignified,`
` ...completely different from how she seemed before she left.`
`We saw that Auntie Rosa was holding something that looked like a gun.`
`{n}......I couldn't imagine that she would have brought back a toy in this situation.`
`"Auntie Rosa, what is...?"`
`"......This is Father's.`
` Because of the current situation, I borrowed it specially.`
` .........I'm sure you all realize as well as I do.`
` The culprit is still nearby.`
` We don't know what could happen."`
`"...............I agree.`
` ......Rather than trying to figure out what the culprit is planning, it might be better to first think about our own safety."`
`"..........................."`
`"Father was alright, but he was slightly agitated by these sudden events.`
` ...Fortunately, he said that he won't leave his room, so he's probably safe.`
` Now, we should do all we can to gather in the same place."`
`"...I agree.`
` We don't even know where the culprit is hiding, ......and anyway, there's no proof that there's only one of them.`
` ..............."`
`I shivered at the words that had come out of my own mouth.`
`That's right.`
` Could a single person kill six people and create such a horrible scene all alone?`
`......Isn't it natural to assume that this crime was carried out by multiple culprits?`
`"......I agree with Rosa‐san.`
` It is probably good for us to gather in one place."`
`"My goodness, yes, I also think that is good, yes, yes!"`
`".........Maybe it would be good to call Milady and Kanon‐san here already."`
`"Good idea.`
` ......Let's have them come down."`
`George‐aniki made to grab the extension phone, but Gohda‐san shook his head.`
`......Oh, right, we can't use the phones right now.`
`"......I'll go with a couple people.`
` If George‐aniki and Gohda‐san come as well, that should be enough."`
`"............No.`
` Let's all go together.`
` ...It's a "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle".`
` {i:If we're all gathered together here in equilibrium}, that situation is the most safe."`
`"...‘Wolves and Sheep Puzzle’?"`
`"......Uu.`
` I have it.`
` Show you."`
`"Maria, turn off the television.`
` ......Genji‐san.`
` Please tell me where Jessica‐chan's room is.`
` Let's all go together."`
`"......Yes.`
` I will guide you."`
`"Come on, everyone.`
` We'll move together.`
` Follow my instructions."`
`We stood up.`
` Maria alone looked like she had some lingering attachment to the TV, but she went along with everyone for now, and got up.`
`"...Shannon, thank goodness.`
` I was a little worried when you took so long to get back."`
`"I am sorry to have worried you.`
` The Master ordered me to copy down something..."`
`"Copy down?"`
`"............Shannon."`
`"I, .........I am sorry, excuse me..."`
`We headed for Jessica's room, led by Genji‐san, and Auntie Rosa, holding the gun.`
`Jessica and Kanon‐kun are a girl and boy of about the same age.`
` That'd sure be a shame if we walked in on them at a bad tiiime, is what I'd have joked about normally, I'm sure.`
`However, Auntie Rosa was on edge, constantly exuding tension.`
` ...So it really wasn't the kind of atmosphere where I could joke like that.`
`"Hey, don't fall behind!!`
` Everyone move together!`
` We don't know when or where the culprit might leap out at us, you know?!"`
`...No, maybe Auntie Rosa's attitude was more appropriate.`
`{n}......Since Grandfather hadn't come down, Auntie Rosa was the leader.`
`This wasn't a situation where she could smile like she always did.`
`......And Auntie Rosa was herself a mother.`
` She probably also thought that, if she didn't get ahold of herself, some harm might befall her beloved daughter.`
`The culprit had killed six of our parents at once.`
`{n}......The method they had used was unknown, but there was a good chance that this opponent could take down a large number of people in an instant.`
`Was that with weapons, or with numbers?`
`{n}......Or was it the magic of a witch?`
`In any case, it definitely didn't look like there were any factors indicating we could get careless...`
`The rest of us should also take much, much greater care, like Auntie Rosa...`
`"............Everyone, stop!"`
`Auntie Rosa spoke in a sharp voice.`
`When we peered forwards, wondering what was up...`
`{n}......we immediately noticed the reason...`
`".........Wh‐......what is this......"`
`"Hii...............!"`
`"Everyone, get back...!"`
`Gohda‐san and Genji‐san approached the door...`
`{n}Jessica's room was probably on the other side of that door.`
`"This......seems to be the same paint that was scribbled on the door to the chapel."`
`"......It appears so.`
` It appears that not much time has passed since it was drawn."`
`"What is that......`
` ......Another...magic circle?!"`
`"......It's the first magic circle of the moon.`
` ...It has the power to open unopenable doors."`
`The door to Jessica's room......had that creepy graffiti on it which had been drawn on the door to the chapel.`
`......That strange shape definitely had some meaning related to the occult.`
`But it didn't matter what that meaning was.`
`{n}We were more worried about whether those two were alright.`
`"Tha‐that doesn't matter!`
` Are Jessica‐chan and Kanon‐kun alright?!"`
`"...I have a bad premonition...`
` We should quickly take those two downstairs."`
`"Milady!`
` Milady!!`
` Are you there?`
` Please answer!!"`
`Gohda‐san knocked violently and yelled, ...but there was no answer.`
`He twisted the doorknob with a clatter, but the lock just resisted him.`
`"......Rosa‐sama, it seems to be locked."`
`"There are no other options.`
` Please open it."`
`Genji nodded, and Gohda quickly unlocked the door with the master key.`
`...In the back of my mind, horrible images floated up and disappeared, one after another.`
`{n}......A magic circle had been drawn on the door to the chapel.`
`{n}And six corpses had been behind that.`
`......So, if there was a magic circle drawn on the door to Jessica's room, ......then beyond it............`
`"Je‐............Jessica‐sama!!"`
`"Wh‐what happened?`
` Is she there?!"`
`"Jessica!!`
` What happened?!!"`
`......It was truly heartless.`
`...The expression on Gohda‐san's face and what he said when he opened the door...`
`prepared us for the brutal fate that Jessica might have met, even without seeing her...`
`Everyone tumbled into Jessica's room at once.`
`{n}...That scene told everyone that their worst fears were right on the mark...`
`"...Jessicaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`".........Oh......my......`
` ...Doc‐...Doctor Nanjo!!"`
`The room seemed elegant for Jessica's age, and there she was inside it, lying on the ground.`
`There was a large pool of blood on the floor.`
`......And there was a knife or something sticking deep into her back......`
`...Was it a knife?`
` There was a design in the handle that had to have been done in a devil motif.`
`There was no doubt that this weapon(?) carried some kind of occult meaning.`
`"...This is.........horrible.`
` ...She has passed away.`
` ......This...probably...reaches her lungs...`
` ......Not much time has passed since she died."`
`"Jessicaaaaaaaaaaaa!!`
` Damn it, damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`"......B‐Battler‐sama......"`
`"I was naive!!`
` I knew it!!`
` Since they couldn't escape the island, the culprit was definitely close by!`
` Then why wasn't I on my guard straight away!!`
` ......I was naive!!`
` I just assumed that culprits sneak away after they commit a crime!"`
`"......We were stunned then.`
` We thought we just had to accept it when Jessica‐chan gave in to rage and ran off.`
` ......But we were naive.`
` We should have stopped her...!"`
`"...Gohda‐san, why did you leave those two alone?!`
` If only you had been with them, something like this would never...!!"`
`"N‐no, you, you see, I...!!`
` I said it was dangerous so we should return!`
` It's just that...Milady said that she wanted to be alone!`
` Kanon‐san told me to leave it to him, and...!"`
`"......Speaking of which, where is Kanon‐san...?!"`
`"That's right!`
` What in the world happened to Kanon‐kun?!"`
`"K‐......Kanon‐kun...`
` Where........."`
`"Kanon‐san should have been with Milady...`
` Where in the world...!"`
`"You don't think...they got him...?!"`
`".......................................`
` Quiet.`
` .........Someone might be hiding in this room.`
` Search under the bed and in the closet!"`
`There was also a chance that Kanon‐kun's corpse had been pushed away somewhere.`
`At Rosa‐san's order, everyone searched the room together.`
`......But there wasn't a single human hiding anywhere.`
`"......He's nowhere!!`
` Could the culprit have taken him out of the room?!`
` Then we have to search for him quickly and save him!`
` ......If we're slow, something awful might happen!!"`
`"Auntie Rosa, let's search all over the mansion!`
` Let's search for the culprit!`
` Let's save Kanon‐kun!!"`
`"........................`
` ............Quiet!!!"`
`Auntie Rosa yelled at us loudly, and we fell instantly silent.`
`She was probably contemplating something.`
`{n}...But what in the world could that be......?`
`...Auntie Rosa walked around the room as though looking for something, ...or as though she was collecting her thoughts.`
`............Then, she found something on the side table by the bed, and picked it up.`
`"...............If anyone knows, tell me.`
` ......What key is this?"`
`Auntie Rosa showed everyone a key with a cute mascot attached to it.`
`...Judging from its cute appearance, I didn't doubt that it was Jessica's key, but I had no way of knowing what key it was.`
`"......It is probably the key to this—to Milady's room."`
`After hearing that, Auntie Rosa made a point of going outside the door and checking.`
`.........Without a doubt, it was the key to this room.`
`"............I wonder why it was set in a place like this.`
` Normally, don't you keep important keys in your pocket?"`
`"...Umm, ............Milady wasn't in the habit of locking her room.`
` Except for when she went to school—`
`it seems she would do it then, because she didn't want Krauss‐sama to look inside her room..."`
`".........I see.`
` She wasn't at school, so it's natural that Jessica‐chan would set the key down here.`
` How many keys can open this door?"`
`"Ju‐...just the one Milady had..."`
`"Can't it be opened with your master keys?"`
`"......They can open it."`
`"How many master keys are there?`
` Do all of the servants have one?`
` Are there extras?"`
`"Yes.`
` We all have one.`
` .........As for extras, ...I wonder."`
`"There used to be several, ...but Madam strongly scolded us that this was careless, so I believe they have been dealt with."`
`"......That is correct.`
` There is only one held by each servant.`
` There are no more."`
`"...nn?`
` Wait a second.`
` ...In the last game, I thought we said there were extra master keys?"`
`"Yes.`
` Regarding that.`
` I have noticed that having several master keys whose locations are unknown is quite disadvantageous for me."`
`"......Well, yeah.`
` Since you want to make me believe in magic by using locked rooms, it must be really disadvantageous for you to have master keys unaccounted for."`
`"...In fact, every time a trick related to locks showed up,`
` I was planning to resist by arguing that the culprit possessed a master key that someone had lost in the past, or a duplicate."`
`"Yes, exactly.`
` So I've decided to make a move to defeat that.`
` ......I'll alter the setup."`
`"`
`{p:1:The only master keys are the ones held by the servants, one key each}.`
` *cackle*cackle*."`
`"...Messing with me.`
` ......More importantly.`
` What is this move?`
` ......What's Auntie Rosa saying?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` Who knows?`
` You should try listening in."`
`"...............Thank you.`
` I have the situation sorted out."`
`"......And I've managed to identify the culprit who assaulted Jessica‐chan, or maybe one of their accomplices."`
`"Wha‐what did you say...?!`
` Who is that?!"`
`"...Auntie Rosa, you can't be talking about Kanon‐kun...?"`
`"......Huh, ......huuuh?!`
` Wh‐why Kanon‐kun?!"`
`"This room was locked.`
` And the only keys that can unlock this room are the master keys that each servant is holding, as well as the key Jessica had."`
`"......But Jessica‐chan's key was closed up in here.`
` ...Which means the only keys that could have locked it are the master keys."`
`"............It is as you say."`
`"In that case, someone killed Jessica‐chan, then locked the door!`
` That person was holding a master key.`
` And there are only five people who were holding master keys!"`
`"Oh, oh my!!`
` It wasn't me, not me!`
` Gracious, no, I couldn't do something like that!"`
`"......Kumasawa‐san, you got up late.`
` After we returned from the chapel to the parlor, we did meet you there,`
` but it's impossible to prove where you were and what you were doing until that time."`
`"You watched us from the shadows, chased after Jessica‐chan and Kanon‐kun when they were isolated, and stealthily attacked them."`
`"A‐are you saying that I visited Milady's room,`
` and did something so horrible?!`
` I, I, I did no such thing!`
` Gracious no, no such thing!!"`
`"What about you, Gohda‐san?`
` You said that you left Jessica‐chan in Kanon‐kun's care and returned."`
`"...But I wonder if that's true?`
` ......I wonder if you didn't really kill the two of them, hide Kanon‐kun's corpse,`
` and then come back with an innocent look on your face?!"`
`"Nothing of the sort happened!`
` I swear on my name that I did not do anything like that!!"`
`"......It, it wasn't us, either...!!`
` We were following the Master's orders and—"`
`"Yes.`
` At least you and Genji‐san are alright.`
` That is backed up by what I heard from Father.`
` The two of you were in Father's room the whole time, one copying and one standing witness.`
` Father and I can guarantee that."`
`".........Thank you very much."`
`"In that case, I think the argument becomes who is more suspicious, Gohda‐san or Kumasawa‐san.`
` ......That's how I thought, too, at least in the first moments after entering this room."`
`".........But then, I thought it was strange.`
` Look at the state of Jessica‐chan's body.`
` Don't you all think it's strange?"`
`"......Strange, ...you say...?"`
`"Jessica‐chan was stabbed in the back.`
` .........Come on, it's often generally said, right?`
` That in crimes where the victim is stabbed in the back, there's a high likelihood that the culprit was someone whose face was known to the victim.`
` She definitely wouldn't invite a person that she doesn't trust into her room, and defenselessly expose her back."`
`"Ro‐......Rosa‐sama, you couldn't mean...`
`.........to say that was Kanon‐kun...?"`
`"Yes.`
` We know well what state Jessica‐chan was in right before she was killed."`
`"......Jessica‐chan was very panicked after seeing her parents' tragic bodies.`
` And it's easy to imagine that after she regained her composure, she'd have been in a horrible slump."`
`"......I can really understand it if Jessica‐chan's frame of mind led her to shut herself up alone in her room.`
` And those particulars would also fit with Gohda‐san's story."`
`"......Jessica‐chan said to leave her alone.`
` ...Then Kanon‐kun, who is of a similar age, and may have had some adolescent relationship with her, said to leave it to him.`
` I can really understand why he'd feel that way."`
`".........And I think that is the very reason why Jessica‐chan welcomed Kanon‐kun into her room."`
`"But what if it had been Gohda‐san or Kumasawa‐san?`
` Would she have let them into her room?"`
`"......I, I believe that I have gained Milady's trust.`
` But even so, err..."`
`"Then you are another suspect after all, right, Gohda‐san?`
` I thought that you probably weren't liked by Jessica‐chan, so I believed she wouldn't have let you into her room."`
`"So I thought it was impossible that you were the culprit, but...?"`
`"No, umm...!`
` .........I am afraid to say that I may not have been accepted by Milady.`
` ...K‐Kumasawa‐san, what about you?"`
`"Ho, hohohohohoho!`
` A senior like me is far too separated by age to understand the feelings of a young person like Milady very well...`
` And perhaps Milady did not open her heart up to me.`
` Right, Gohda‐san?!"`
`"Yes, that's right!`
` She probably did not open her heart to us to a great degree!`
` It would be inconceivable that Milady would let us into her room when she was heartbroken!"`
`Gohda‐san and Kumasawa baa‐chan each clasped their hands together, affirming each other with forced smiles on their faces.`
`It was a really unpleasant routine.`
`"Someone who would be permitted to enter Jessica‐chan's room when she was heartbroken.`
` Who would have been given access to her defenseless back.`
` And that person had a master key.`
` That only points to one person.`
` ......It was impossible for anyone except Kanon‐kun."`
`"Ple‐......please, wait...!`
` Kanon‐kun definitely wouldn't do something like...!"`
`"Oh, then, is there someone else?`
` Is Gohda‐san or Kumasawa‐san suspicious after all?`
` Which of the two do you think is more suspicious, Shannon‐chan...? Come on."`
`"I, ......I, ...don't............"`
`"It wasn't me, Shannon‐san!`
` Gracious, no, it was not me!"`
`"Of course, it wasn't me either!`
` It was Kanon‐san who had a close relationship with Milady, and you, Shannon‐san, if anyone!"`
`".........Oh yes, I almost forgot.`
` ......Jessica‐chan might also have let Shannon‐chan into her room."`
`"But you should have been with Father.`
` .........But in reality,`
` ......are you the culprit...............?"`
`"Sha‐......Shannon can't be the culprit!`
` You only just said that she was doing some important work with Grandfather!"`
`"Yes, I know that.`
` Neither Shannon‐chan nor Genji‐san is the culprit.`
` Even Father acknowledges that they were together the whole time.`
` .........Well then, what do you think, everyone...?"`
`Asked that, no one could respond...`
`{n}Because even if someone did argue back, they would then have to offer the name of a different suspicious person.`
`......And no matter whose name that was, that person was here.`
`{n}...No one could do something like that.`
`Auntie Rosa glanced at everyone in turn, fingering the gun like it was a toy...`
`.........She seemed so different from the normal, kind Auntie Rosa.`
`...No, it's probably because I still don't feel how much danger we're in.`
`{n}...Maybe until Auntie Rosa's attitude seemed natural to me, I wasn't fully appreciating the danger...`
`"Looks like no one has an opinion.`
` Then I will say mine."`
`"Of course, I can't deny the possibility that Kanon‐kun is a victim without a corpse.`
` But until we find his corpse, I also definitely can't deny the possibility that Kanon‐kun is a suspect."`
`"......There's a chance that Kanon‐kun may claim to have been attacked by the culprit and confined somewhere...`
` He may appear unexpectedly with that excuse."`
`"But take care.`
` Maybe, probably—no, definitely.`
` .........{i:Kanon‐kun killed Jessica‐chan}."`
`"............No, ..................no way........."`
`"I, ...I can't believe it...`
` For Kanon‐kun to do that...`
`......to Milady,`
` ......that's too much to accept!!"`
`"I feel the same as Shannon.`
` I oppose labeling Kanon‐kun as the culprit."`
`"Then is the culprit Gohda‐san or is it Kumasawa‐san?`
` Tell me who's more suspicious."`
`""I‐i‐i‐it wasn't us!!""`
`"If it wasn't Kanon‐kun, then who could have locked this door?`
` Shannon‐chan.`
` George‐kun.`
` ......Well?`
` Well, well, well...?"`
`Auntie Rosa closed in on Shannon‐chan and George‐aniki, laughing unpleasantly.`
`...Of course, they couldn't say anything back.`
`They wanted to believe in Kanon‐kun.`
` ...But if they did, they would have to suspect the other servants.`
`The simplest culprit was the mystery guest {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}......But she was nothing more than a guest, and didn't have a master key.`
`.........Then if {f:5:Beatrice} was the culprit without a master key...`
`...Do we have to accept the argument that she really is a witch, and locked the door with the power of magic......?`
`"............That's a filthy argument...`
` ......Filthy...... Filthy......"`
`"What's so difficult?`
` Make it my fault.`
` You can just make it the fault of the 19th person, the mystery guest, can you not?`
` If you do, you won't have to watch this ugly battle of humans pressing each other...`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"So then what.`
` The culprit is the 19th person, the guest {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...She's a witch, so she could lock the door without a key using magic."`
`"Are you telling me to accept that?`
` No goddamn way...!`
` ...No way, no goddamn way...!!"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` In the last game, I learned all of your weak points.`
` So, what now, what now...?`
` You said you're never going to accept me, did you not?`
` In that case, .........you can use Kanon as a perfect sacrifice."`
`"Kanon killed Jessica!`
` If you support Rosa's theory, everything is settled here, you know?`
` Kanon is already dead.`
` There should be no need to show concern for the dead.`
` And you won't have to doubt anyone here!`
` *cackle*hahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!"`
`"Damn it!!`
` I won't accept you!!!`
` But......Kanon‐kun being the culprit, ......that's impossible!!"`
`"..........I don't want to suspect anyone.`
` ...However, it is sometimes the case that the suspicious are the guilty.`
` ......In any case, there is probably nothing better than caution..."`
`"Doc‐...Doctor Nanjo...`
` What do you mean by that...?"`
`"...Umm, please do not misunderstand.`
` ...I do not wish to label Kanon‐san as the culprit.`
` ......However, until we understand the situation, there is the possibility that Kanon‐san is the culprit,`
` and I believe keeping that in mind is safer."`
`"Ho, ......hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` Yes, that's right... You cannot be too cautious."`
`It didn't seem as though anyone blamed Nanjo.`
`{n}In reality, no one thought that Kanon was the culprit.`
`...But if they didn't suspect him, they would have to suspect one of the servants here.`
`......We didn't want to do that.`
`{n}We didn't want to suspect.`
`{n}We didn't want to be suspected.`
`"That is the correct way to think.`
` ......We cannot be too vigilant.`
` Is there anyone who objects to that?"`
`"Listen.`
` ...There is a very high likelihood that this murder case is related to the legend of Father's gold.`
` In that case, it's certainly the crime of someone plotting to keep a vast amount of gold worth tens of billions of yen all for themselves."`
`"......With that amount of money, you could play around for the rest of your life in any country.`
` ...It may be possible that they would massacre us for this reason."`
`".............................."`
`"For the simple reason that our guest wasn't holding a master key, for the murder of Jessica‐chan, and this murder alone,`
` we removed our 19th person—{f:5:Beatrice}—from suspicion.`
` But we can't say that she is unrelated to the crime."`
`"......After all, it's a vast amount of gold we're talking about.`
` We can't deny the possibility that there are multiple culprits.`
` ......Right now, one of the people here among us might have been bought by the culprit!!"`
`As Auntie Rosa yelled, she looked all around, her gun still raised.`
`......Don't believe anyone, suspect the person next to you—that's what she was saying.`
`But no one wanted to suspect.`
`{n}...They didn't want to suspect anyone here.`
`That weakness in their hearts demanded an answer from those not here...`
`"There are only two groups of people you can be sure aren't suspects.`
` .........Yourself, and those who are already corpses.`
` .........The same goes for Kanon‐kun."`
`"Until we catch sight of his corpse, he is the most likely suspect in Jessica‐chan's murder!!`
` So take care.`
` Even if he's still alive, even if he smooths things over with some explanation, you absolutely must not trust him!`
` Alright?!"`
`No one gave a answer of their own initiative.`
` ......However, those who met Auntie Rosa's eyes had to nod their heads...`
`Humans are social beings.`
`{n}......In other words, from the time they are born, trusting each other is imprinted in their genes.`
`...It is unpleasant to go against that.`
`They definitely don't want to suspect anyone.`
`...But if they had to suspect someone,`
` ...they thought that choosing one of the people not here right now would be the most acceptable.`
`For just the reason of acceptability, they had passively chosen to sacrifice Kanon.`
`This is ridiculous.........`
`{n}I definitely don't want to believe that Kanon‐kun is the culprit!`
`I'd only just heard it from George‐aniki, but not only were those two close in age,`
` they also had that adolescent relationship Auntie Rosa had mentioned.`
`......It may be a little late now, but yes, they really did have that kind of air about them.`
`After seeing her parents' tragic bodies, Jessica, bearing deep wounds in her heart, would only have trusted Kanon‐kun.`
`...That's a very conceivable story.`
`{n}So I don't like it...!!`
`Kanon‐kun was the only one she trusted.`
`{n}So she wouldn't have let anyone but Kanon‐kun in.`
`So he was the only one who could have killed Jessica. ......I just can't accept that line of argument......!!!`
`"...Understand?!`
` Even if Kanon‐kun appears, don't get careless!`
` As long as we cannot prove Kanon‐kun's innocence, we will suppose that Kanon‐kun is the culprit who killed Jessica‐chan!!"`
`Auntie Rosa made that claim.`
` By using the ever‐so‐slightly vague word "suppose", ...ultimately, she gave everyone that last little push they needed.`
`Everyone nodded weakly,`
` ...............and, under the excuse that they were just temporarily supposing it,`
` .........they {i:concluded} that Kanon was the culprit who had killed Jessica...`
`.........I wonder what the dead Jessica and Kanon would think if they could hear this exchange.`
`Jessica...was crying.`
`{n}......She was crying in the chest of the person who had put his life on the line to fight for her: Kanon.`
`It was frustrating.`
`{n}So frustrating that it felt like her chest would explode...`
`She grieved and resented how far the dignity of the dead had been trampled...`
`"...Those guys, ...why are they treating you like the culprit?!!"`
`"........................Because there's...no corpse."`
`"Why are they treating you like the culprit because there's no corpse?!`
` You risked your life to fight for me...!"`
`"Then, ......that witch erased your corpse for fun......!`
` To call you the culprit because of that, it's horrible, it's too horrible!!"`
`".........It's alright.`
` ......In the end, I couldn't completely protect you, but...`
` .........I was able to be of use to you, Milady..."`
`"So......why doesn't everyone understand that?!`
` Stop it, Auntie Rosa!!`
` Don't call Kanon‐kun the culprit with that messed up reasoning!!"`
`".........She isn't saying that I'm the culprit.`
` ...She's just saying I'm suspicious,`
` ......no,`
` ......she's saying to be careful."`
`"She is saying it!!`
` These people are saying you're the culprit, Kanon‐kun, so they can stop thinking!`
` They aren't gonna think about who the culprit who killed me is anymore!!`
` They aren't gonna think of the possibility that you aren't the culprit!!"`
`"And after this, every time something happens, they'll repeat the excuse that it was the work of Kanon‐kun who's gone missing!!`
` ......I can't stand that!!"`
`"...............It's alright.`
` ...At least you know the truth, Milady."`
`"If only I know the truth, that's pointless!!`
` I found out by dying.`
` Truth belongs to living humans!!`
` If the truth doesn't remain, the dead won't be rewarded!!`
` They won't know why you risked your life!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, hahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!`
` Truly a splendid sight.`
` It is a rare honey that is sweeter than the laments of the dead."`
`"Lament, lament.`
` No matter how much you lament, the voices of the dead never reach the living."`
`"Damn it, damn iiiiiiit!!"`
`"It doesn't matter who!!`
` Hear my voice!!`
` Kanon‐kun isn't the culprit!!`
` Kanon‐kun's corpse was just erased!`
` Why, why don't you understand that?!!"`
`".........Milady."`
`"......I can't take this!!`
` It's so sad!`
` It's so frustrating!!"`
`"If it's like this, ......you died for nothing!!`
` The dead have no honor unless the living acknowledge it!`
` It doesn't matter who!`
` Realize!!`
` Realize!! Please!!`
` Kanon‐kun isn't the culprit!!"`
`"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahh, don't go, don't go, guys!!`
` Please, don't end it like this......!`
` Don't go, ......don't goooooooooooooo!!!"`
`Rosa proclaimed that this room should be sealed until the police came.`
`...The rest didn't want to suspect each other, so they happily accepted that.`
`......They accepted Kanon as the tentative culprit.`
`...Without even imagining how much disgrace that gave to the dead, they accepted it.`
`"......Milady... It's alright now...`
` ......Thank you......"`
`"Don't go!!`
` Don't go, guys!!"`
`"I beg you, come back!!`
` Don't leave us like this!!"`
`"Don't leave......Kanon‐kun......treated as the culprit!!!!!!!`
` Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!"`
`"It won't reach!!`
` The laments of the dead never reach!"`
`"You make me laugh, yes, that face of yours makes me laugh!!`
` You're thinking it will reach, aren't youuu?`
` It won't reach, Jessicaaaaaaa!!!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, wahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"That's no goddamn good."`
`"Huh?`
` .........Battler‐kun, did you say something?"`
`"Yeah, this is no good.`
` ...{i:It's no goddamn good at all}."`
`At the time everyone made to leave the room,`
` ...only Battler had his back to them, and he was still looking down at Jessica's body.`
`"What do you mean, ...it's no good at all?`
` Do you have some objection...?"`
`"I'll at least agree that we have to be vigilant.`
` ......But this talk about having Kanon‐kun be the culprit, sorry, but allow me to refuse."`
`"......Hoh.`
` So you're biting into this part.`
` If Kanon wasn't the culprit, and it wasn't my doing either, then how do you explain this locked room that Jessica's room has become...?"`
`".........Honestly, I've gotta throw my hands up there.`
` ...Seriously, why'd I say it's no goddamn good?"`
`"...I've gotta take responsibility for my own actions.`
` Ihihihihi...!`
` ...............I'm empty‐handed with zero weapons to argue with.`
` ...But you know, I won't stand here twiddling my thumbs anymore!! {f:5:Beatrice}!!"`
`"B‐......Battler‐sama......"`
`"......I‐is there some proof that Kanon‐kun isn't the culprit......?"`
`The expression that rose to those two faces was definitely expectant.`
`{n}......They didn't want to believe that Kanon was the culprit.`
`{n}In truth, they believed in Kanon.`
`So this expectation was because they wanted to be made to believe in him even more strongly!`
`"Then, Battler‐kun, which of the other servants do you suspect?`
` Gohda‐san?`
` Or is it Kumasawa‐san?"`
`"Quit it, Auntie Rosa.`
` ...I know the person called Kumasawa baa‐chan well.`
` ......She'll sometimes slack off on work, but she'll always try to make things fun for people.`
` ......She is not a person who would kill, not even if her eyes were dazzled by money."`
`"B‐......Battler‐sama........."`
`"And I've just met Gohda‐san yesterday.`
` ......Honestly, I still don't really understand him.`
` ......But there is one thing I understand."`
`"........................I, I........."`
`"......I've never seen someone look so happy to be making food.`
` ...You're the same.`
` The same as Kumasawa baa‐chan.`
` ......Gohda‐san likes to make people happy."`
`"As if a person like that could kill those who praised his own food as delicious, ...even if money was piled up in front of him!!"`
`"...Then, who do you think killed Jessica‐chan, Battler‐kun?`
` Who do you think shut Jessica‐chan up in a room that could only be locked by a master key?"`
`"Wait.`
` ......Before I argue about that, there's something I want to make clear.`
` I don't want to talk about, if so‐and‐so is not the culprit, then so‐and‐so is the culprit.`
` ...I just want to talk about how it's completely impossible for Kanon‐kun to be the culprit."`
`"You say that you can establish that Kanon isn't the culprit?`
` *cackle*, how?!"`
`"It's really simple.`
` ...It's something I came dangerously close to overlooking.`
` ......Beato!"`
`"Repetition requested!!`
` Say it if you can: "Kanon‐kun was holding a master key"!!"`
`"...........................Hoh...!"`
`"......Kanon‐kun wasn't holding a master key?!`
` How can you tell that?!"`
`"I heard what Gohda‐san said before.`
` Just before he split up with Kanon‐kun.`
` ...The part about when Jessica went to raid the VIP room."`
`".........Gohda‐san, you did a good job remembering it.`
` You protected Kanon‐kun's honor."`
`"......I,`
` ......I...`
`did...?!"`
`"I heard him talk about the same thing.`
` But I don't really understand!`
` Could you explain it, Battler‐kun?!"`
`"......That's right.`
` When Jessica unlocked the VIP room,`
` she borrowed the key from Kanon‐kun, {i:but didn't give it back}!`
` So Kanon‐kun wasn't holding a master key!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Or was he?"`
`"Certainly, Gohda has no recollection of the master key being returned to Kanon.`
` However, she might have returned it when Gohda wasn't looking!`
` How can you prove that it definitely didn't happen?!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*, if you could just search the pocket of Kanon's corpse, you could probably establish that, but you can't!!`
` It is impossible to prove!!"`
`"You're no goddamn good at all.`
` It's truly simple to prove, isn't it?"`
`"......No way...!`
` So, you're saying that Kanon‐kun wasn't holding a key?!"`
`"Yeah.`
` And to prove it, all you have to do is search Jessica.`
` ......Kanon‐kun's master key should be in Jessica's pocket.`
` Doctor Nanjo, would you check for us?"`
`"Ye‐......yes."`
`Nanjo dashed up to Jessica, and searched in her jacket pocket......`
`{n}Everyone...hoped for it.........!`
`"......mgh..."`
`...Please.`
` Be there............!!`
`"......Here it is!`
` Is this it?"`
`"...............Yes.`
` That is a master key.`
` Without a doubt."`
`At Genji's statement, there was a small "oooh" of joyful voices.`
`"That is Kanon‐kun's master key.`
` .........I'll say it again."`
`"‘Kanon‐kun isn't holding a master key’.`
` Therefore, there's no way he could have locked the door!!"`
`"......It certainly does...appear that way.`
` ......But Kanon‐kun was the last person to meet Jessica‐chan.`
` The fact that he's suspicious hasn't changed."`
`"Let's......give that a rest."`
`"......Huh?"`
`"Humans were originally supposed to be creatures that trust each other.`
` ...But in order to live in a tough world, we learn to be wary.`
` ...So we'll doubt anything.`
` We are sad creatures.`
` ...I won't deny that's our nature."`
`"...............But I won't permit you to come to a conclusion without proof!!`
` The suspicious are not the guilty, they are the innocent!!`
` Of course, the world is full of wolves.`
` I won't tell you to carelessly believe everyone!"`
`"But if you're going to say someone's guilty, prepare some perfect evidence!`
` Unless you can do that, never say someone is guilty because of speculation!!!"`
`"...............u......`
` That's........."`
`"......I was the one who said the suspicious were the guilty.`
` .........That was thoughtless.`
` I apologize."`
`"............Battler‐sama........."`
`"...W‐wonderful reasoning, Battler‐kun!`
` Thank you too, Gohda‐san.`
` Because of what you remembered, Kanon‐kun is cleared from suspicion!"`
`"N‐no, I... Hahahaha..."`
`Clap clap clap...`
` ...It was the dry sound of the witch's applause.`
`"Well done, well done.`
` ......Not a bad job."`
`".........Shit.`
` Did I just fall for a blatant bait piece...?"`
`"You wonderfully proved that at least Kanon couldn't lock the door to this room.`
` The servants should all have been holding master keys.`
` With that as a basis, Kanon was treated as the culprit, so you did a wonderful job of at least clearing away that suspicion.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`"......In that case.`
` ...How did the culprit who killed Jessica lock the door?`
` So that's the problem I have now."`
`"Tch.`
` ......I've been drawn into a development that went exactly like you wanted..."`
`"Right into my trap, yes...?`
` Furthermore, you said something outrageous about not doubting any of the other servants.`
` Wellll then, it'll be worth seeing how you gloss this over..."`
`"Shut your face.`
` ...Let's get this started.`
` I'm sure I'll be denied from all angles, ...but first I'll verify the definition of what it means for this room to be a locked room."`
`"Very well.`
` First,`
` {p:1:there are absolutely no types of hidden doors}.`
` {p:1:This door is the only way in or out}.`
` {p:1:The only way to lock this door is with Jessica's single key or the master keys, only one of which is held by each servant}."`
`"It is on the second floor, but it is probably possible to enter or leave through the window.`
` However,`
` {p:1:the window is locked from the inside}."`
`"......Let me flip over the chessboard right away.`
` ...If I start by arguing about the door and the lock, I probably won't leave the palm of your hand."`
`"Do as you like.`
` Well then, well then, what should I repeat?"`
`".........Repetition requested.`
` "Kanon‐kun was killed in this room"."`
`"Mmhm.`
` "{p:1:Kanon was killed in this room}".`
` Although I erased his corpse with magic, of course?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"And again, repetition requested.`
` "Kanon‐kun's corpse is in this room"."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` I decline.`
` I cannot repeat it.`
` ...Because I erased the corpse with magic.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"Of course you wouldn't.`
` ......There's got to be a secret hidden in there somewhere."`
`" ......Damn, where's the point of contention to this riddle?`
` .........Is it that they locked it without a master key?`
` Or is it how they managed to kill two people who were inside a room with the door locked?`
` Or is it how they managed to escape after killing them both?"`
`"......I hate to say it, but I'll have to tackle this one step at a time.`
` ...Repetition requested.`
` ......‘The last time it was locked was by a master key’."`
`"I also decline that.`
` *cackle*cackle*."`
`"......This declining thing is really vague.`
` I don't know if you decline because it's impossible to repeat, or whether you can repeat it and you're declining on purpose..."`
`"Back when discussing the lock to the chapel, you completely turned the tables on me.`
` When I have an advantage, there's no need to go out of my way to speak using the red, which carries risk.`
` That's all it is."`
`".........Yeah, I guess so.`
` ...At its heart, the red is something you use when you want to stop my strange theories."`
`"It is natural that I would use it to my advantage.`
` Because of the risk of it being quibbled with, I won't use it uselessly."`
`"...*cackle*cackle*.`
` Well then, what move will you come at me with next?`
` A move that puts Gohda or Kumasawa under suspicion would probably be the easiest to use, right...?"`
`"......Damn.`
` It's like you're leading me down a path, goddamn annoying...`
` Stay quiet a while, I'm thinking...!"`
`"Of course, this door is the same as the chapel.`
` {p:1:When locked, it does not permit any form of entry or exit}."`
`"I'll say more. {p:1:No trick could have the effect of locking the door from the outside without using a key}.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"Tch.`
` Damn you for always using red when I don't ask for it..."`
`............Let's back up.`
` ...Let me just think.`
`{n}I'll lay out everything I know.`
`First, there are two victims.`
`Jessica and Kanon‐kun.`
`...Kanon‐kun's corpse isn't here, but {f:5:Beatrice} admitted in red that Kanon‐kun was killed.`
`So even without a corpse, he's included as a victim.`
`There are a few questionable points.`
` And depending on which I focus on, my line of thought changes a lot.`
`First, after the culprit committed murder in this room, how did they lock it?`
`If we assume that the culprit was one of those holding a master key, it's extremely simple.`
`......But I want to avoid that if I can.`
`Because I would have to suspect Gohda‐san or Kumasawa‐san—no, in the worst case, even Shannon‐chan and Genji‐san.`
`At this point, I noticed something.`
`......I'm contradicting myself.`
`{n}I'm cutting my own throat.`
`I want to deny {f:5:Beatrice} no matter what.`
`{n}I want to erase the existence of that brutal, fickle, ridiculous witch!`
`In order to do that, I have to explain everything with humans, not magic.`
`......But that also means suspecting some human.`
`I don't want to suspect someone.`
`......Of course, if there was some clear proof, I would have to believe that person was the culprit,`
` ...but as long as that didn't happen, I didn't want to cast any suspicions.`
`Am I just green...?`
`{n}Am I just a kid who doesn't want to have my feelings, which tell me that at least this person or that person couldn't be a murderer, betrayed...?`
`I want to deny that it was a witch; I also want to deny that it was a human.`
`{n}.........Now I don't know what is what anymore...`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` In the first place, the only victory condition in our game regarded whether or not you could deny my existence.`
` ...Even though that alone was a game that put you at a disadvantage, you've increased the number of victory conditions all by yourself, and made your own victory difficult...!"`
`......It's just as she says.`
` ...If I started arguing that someone holding a master key was the culprit, this locked room could be easily broken.`
`......However, since the number of keys that could open this door are limited,`
` and furthermore it's clearly known who holds them,`
` saying that would mean that I was suspecting someone I knew well...`
`...No, ......have I just been averting my eyes?`
`In that locked room trick with the chapel, which had been exhilarating to destroy,`
` I had proposed that "someone stole the key from Maria's handbag, and returned it".`
` If that theory was right, then the question becomes who could have stolen the key from her handbag.`
`...Maria's handbag had probably been at its most unguarded when she was sleeping.`
`......In that case,`
` .........in addition to me,`
` ...George‐aniki and Jessica are also suspects.`
`George‐aniki or Jessica was the culprit?`
`{n}Or maybe an accomplice?!`
`......All of our parents had been killed, right?!`
`{n}And yet, ......and yet, one of us consented to that and assisted with the crime?!`
`We had lamented, mourned, and shed tears in the chapel.`
`{n}...And yet, one among us......had been lying?!`
`"......*cackle*cackle*.`
` That theory of yours about taking the key out of the handbag and putting it back cast a pronounced suspicion on the cousins, did it not...?"`
`"Quite impressive—in spite of that, you managed to act like you didn't notice,`
` and spoke your theory with such gusto...!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"D‐............damn it...`
` That doesn't guarantee that one of the family or the servants is the culprit!`
` If you snuck up on us hiding in a cardboard box, for example,`
` there's a good chance you could have slunk into our room when we were fast asleep and stolen the key, right?!"`
`"Mmm.`
` That would also be acceptable in that instance.`
` By suspecting me as the guest, the 19th person, you won't have to suspect them."`
`".........But then, what will you do about the lock to Jessica's room?`
` It's no trouble at all for me to open the lock with magic, but of course, I don't have a master key.`
` If you deny my magic, you also have to deny that I'm a suspect, you realize...?"`
`"And what that entails is suspecting one of you 18...!!"`
`"Tha‐......thanks for the lovely explanation.`
` ...I've been able to sort things out a bit."`
`"......My goal is to pursue how the 19th person, the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} guest {f:5:Beatrice}, committed the crimes.`
` If I do that, I won't have to suspect anyone!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` If you can do that, yes...!`
` Foolish man.`
` ......A room like this never needed to be a locked room at all.`
` After all, there are a total of six keys that can open it."`
`"And there were several who possessed those keys!`
` You can suspect any of them!`
` Suspect as much as you like!!`
` But you went to all the trouble of denying all of those, and made it a locked room yourself."`
`".........Understand?`
` This is a locked room born from your mental contradiction.`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` There's no one else, you closed that door yourself."`
`"......So accept that a witch opened it with magic,`
` ...or accept that someone I know is the culprit—those are my only two options, you're saying.`
` Damn, are you trying to fork the rook?!"`
`"I merely wanted to show you that this move also exists."`
`"......*cackle*.`
` So, what will you do, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeer?`
` Isn't it a truly simple problemmm...?`
` You just have to make sacrifices of that overly self‐confident cook and that hag who should have died yeeears ago.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"...............Damn it!!`
` So if I suspect Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san, everything's fine?!`
` That's no good!"`
`".........I can't think of Gohda‐san as the culprit!`
` I can't think of Kumasawa‐san as the culprit!!`
` But I won't accept you!!`
` Ever!!"`
`"In that case, they would have to enter the room without using magic or a master key,`
` kill Jessica and Kanon, and even erase Kanon's corpse without using magic."`
`"......How could it be done?!`
` How could it be done so that you can deny me and not suspect anyone at the same time?!!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"............Resign."`
`"Huh?`
` Battler‐kun, what did you say?"`
`"......I give up.`
` I was able to prove that Kanon‐kun couldn't have locked this door.`
` ......But that doesn't mean I was able to figure out who killed Jessica."`
`"N‐......no, ...that's more than enough...`
` Umm, ......for doing all that for Kanon‐kun,`
` ...thank you very much...!"`
`"......I don't want thanks.`
` After all, ......that means that you're under suspicion too."`
`"....................."`
`"...And sorry, Auntie Rosa.`
` ......It's not like I wanted to be defiant towards you.`
` I don't want to die either, and I want to find Dad and the rest's true killer.`
` ......Sorry for saying something that wasn't cooperative."`
`"......No, it's alright.`
` I was also a little rash.`
` Let's make up.`
` As auntie and nephew, we have to be friendly with each other.`
` ............Right?"`
`Auntie Rosa shifted the gun to one hand, and held out her other hand.`
`...I reached out, and for the time being, we shook hands.`
`Auntie's gaze was sharp.`
`{n}......In order to deny the witch, she would make anyone a sacrifice.`
`{n}...That's what her eyes told me.`
`And me...?`
`{n}I denied the witch.`
`{n}......But I wasn't prepared to lose anything.`
`I was probably the one who thought himself most ready to fight, ......and the one standing furthest from the truth.`
