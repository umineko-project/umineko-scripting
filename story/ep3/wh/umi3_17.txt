`"Dad, ...Mom...!! `
`Who would do something like this...?!! `
`Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!" `
`Jessica's woeful voice echoed throughout the rose garden... `
`Perhaps it was the intuition of a person who lived on this island. `
`...After checking the part of the rose garden where Aunt Rosa and Maria had fallen and seeing nothing, `
`Jessica went to look in the arbor next. `
`Normally, the arbor was probably a wonderful location to enjoy tea peacefully while appreciating the roses on a good sunny day. `
`...Maybe even Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi... `
`had days when they relaxed and enjoyed their tea together here. `
`...In that arbor lay their corpses. `
`At least they aren't drenched in the rain like Aunt Rosa and Maria had been, `
`but there was no way I could say that out loud to Jessica at the moment... `
`"...What do you think, Doctor Nanjo?" `
`"...St-Strangulation, I believe. `
`...Come, take a look at this. `
`On their necks, there are distinct markings that something thin was used to strangle them." `
`"Right. `
`...I doubt those things were the primary cause for their deaths." `
`Right there...lay two stake-like weapons decorated with an occult design, `
`which had been found driven into Uncle Krauss's thigh area... `
`and near Aunt Natsuhi's calf. `
`When we found these sticking out of my parents' forehead and chest, `
`we decided to preserve the crime scene and leave them for the police, `
`...but Jessica didn't care about such matters and immediately pulled the stakes out of her parents' forsaken bodies. `
`"...By now, bodies gouged in the head, chest, stomach, knee, and leg have been found." `
`"Aaaaaaaaahh, damn it, damn it, damn it!! `
`I'll kill that murderer, kill him!! `
`Uwaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!" `
`"...With this, the eighth twilight has been completed. `
`...Is this going to continue onto the ninth twilight? `
`...The witch shall be revived, and none shall be left alive." `
`"Bring it on... `
`...If the witch revives, `
`...that means the culprit is gonna make his grand appearance, right?! `
`No one's going to be left alive? Bullshit... `
`...I'll kill him...! `
`I'll definitely kill the culprit who killed Dad and Mom with my own hands...!!" `
`Jessica let her emotions flow out as she howled furiously. `
`...To avoid being crushed by grief, she could do nothing but resist it with anger. `
`"...We still...haven't found George. `
`...Jessica, you children had better stay here. `
`I'll go into the mansion." `
`"E-Eva-san, we mustn't split up...!! `
`It's dangerous if we do not all stick together...!" `
`"There's nothing we can do for Nii-san or his wife. `
`But George may be still alive somewhere...! `
`I have no time to waste here...!!" `
`As Aunt Eva screamed this, Jessica glared at her. `
`...Eva had no more time to bother about the dead. `
`She was more concerned for the safety of her only son, who had yet to be seen. `
`"Jessica-chan, you should stay by your father and mother's side. `
`I'll make a short trip to the mansion. `
`Battler-kun and Doctor Nanjo, you two can stay here as well." `
`After arbitrarily saying this, Aunt Eva rushed out of the arbor. `
`I called out to stop her, but there was no way she would listen. `
`...However, being alone in this situation meant nothing short of death. `
`If we silently watched her leave, it would be the same as letting her die. `
`Since Aunt Eva was unwilling to stop, we had no choice but to follow her. `
`...And, while it may be cruel to say so, `
`Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi were already dead, `
`so there was nothing more we could do for them... `
`In the end, we had no choice but to console Jessica and head for the mansion together. `
`...Fortunately, Jessica stood up. `
`Perhaps she had been able to break free from her grief. `
`...But...what had surfaced in its place was an expression like a demon's. `
`"...I'll kill that person with my own hands, ...I'll definitely avenge them...... `
`...Let's go, Battler. `
`If we find the culprit, don't get in my way. `
`I'm definitely gonna kill them...!!" `
`"......I've got my own parents to avenge. `
`Sorry, but this is first come, first serve." `
`"...Yeah, ...that's right... `
`...Let's kill them!" `
`At my words, Jessica finally seemed to feel like we sympathized with her emotions. `
`She still had that dark expression, but I felt that Jessica had regained some of her sanity. `
`We took off. `
`Chasing after Aunt Eva. `
`Through the rose garden, `
`up the stone steps, `
`running at full speed towards the mansion, ...whose large, intimidating shadow flashed in the lightning. `
`...With this, the murders of the epitaph have reached the eighth twilight. `
`And then, on the ninth twilight, the witch shall revive. `
`...None shall be left alive. `
`I will most likely lose my life. `
`...But at the very least, I want to burn the truth into my eyes. `
`That's the only thing motivating me to move right now. `
`We were able to meet up with Aunt Eva, who was having trouble with the lock to the front door. `
`It seemed that all the blood had risen to Aunt Eva's head. `
`That was probably making her fingers clumsy. `
`It looked like she couldn't even handle the simple task of inserting the key into the lock. `
`...Then, there was a faint sound. `
`The sound of the door unlocking. `
`Just as though it had waited for all the survivors to unite before opening. `
`It felt to me as though the malicious mansion... `
`was trying to swallow up all the remaining humans at once... `
`Perhaps the stench that erupted outwards the instant the door opened... `
`couldn't be described as just a smell. `
`It wasn't just the charred smell from Grandfather. `
`...I think it also may have contained the regrets of the servants and Dad's group, `
`...all of the dead. `
`...What did it mean as it floated out, overwhelming us? `
`...Was it the cry of the dead, telling us not to enter? `
`However, Aunt Eva didn't even flinch at something like that. `
`...And we who had to chase after her... `
`were forced to step into the mansion, even after receiving that message... `
`"George?! `
`George!! `
`If you can hear me, answer! `
`Geoooooorge!!" `
`Aunt Eva shouted at the top of her lungs. `
`...Considering the situation, it's probably far too optimistic to imagine that he's alive. `
`When we started following Aunt Eva's example and calling out George's name in loud voices... `
`...Aunt Eva spotted something...and stopped walking. `
`She was standing in front of the door to the parlor. `
`"......What is this......? `
`D-Doctor Nanjo, could you come here for a second...?" `
`"Wh-What is it...?" `
`I'd heard about the eerie magic circles written on doors, like the one on the parlor, from the adults. `
`...Eerie is the only word to describe that thing, `
`which was scribbled with a deep-red paint, reminiscent of blood, so that it slowly dripped down. `
`However, that had supposedly been there since this morning. `
`...Wondering why Aunt Eva, who had supposedly seen it already, `
`would think it odd now, Jessica and I stared at the door... `
`"...Certainly, ......I have no memory of numbers such as these being written here." `
`"Right, they weren't. `
`...Eerie magical characters were written here, but not numbers." `
`From what the two of them said, only the magic circle had been there this morning. `
`However, right now, there were eight digits written near the upper part of the magic circle. `
`07151129. `
`...I didn't know what it meant, `
`but I didn't even want to imagine what someone had been thinking when they wrote it. `
`It was drawn with the same paint as the magic circle, `
`...but it had clearly been written very recently. `
`The way it had dried and the condition of the color was completely different from the magic circle part. `
`"......Heh. `
`I'm sure it just has some magical meaning. `
`No point wasting time thinking about it." `
`Jessica intentionally spat those words out in an attempt to push aside the eerie feel it gave off. `
`"It...could be a magic {i:square}. `
`...The idea that a ward against magic can reside in a certain sort of number play. `
`I believe everyone has heard of the one where adding all of the numbers in each row leads to the same sum..." `
`"Wasn't that a group of numbers buried in a rectangle? `
`This is just a single row. `
`I don't have a clue what it could mean. `
`...What Jessica-chan said is probably correct. `
`There isn't any point in us wasting time thinking about it..." `
`Even though she said that, she probably suspected that it actually meant something. `
`Aunt Eva was deftly writing that number down `
`on an old receipt or something with a short ballpoint pen. `
`Unless it had some obvious pattern, it'd probably be tough to memorize a code made up of an eight-digit number. `
`............ `
`"......Couldn't... `
`...this be a date, `
`...or something?" `
`"A date...? `
`What are you talking about...?" `
`"Well, ...it's probably a coincidence, `
`but my birthday...... `
`is July 15. `
`...Once I thought that 0715 might refer to July 15, `
`I figured that if 1129 stood for November 29, maybe that'd fit perfectly..." `
`"......Why would your birthday be written in a place like this? `
`And what's up with November 29...?" `
`"That's what I wanna know... `
`Still, ...it's probably just a coincidence. `
`When I thought about it, it started to feel a little creepy. `
`...What if someone's birthday was November 29? `
`That's not the birthday of anyone else in my family, not Dad or Kyrie-san or Ange. `
`And of course, it isn't my Mom's either." `
`"Nothing comes to mind... `
`...I don't believe it's Kinzo-san's or Genji-san's birthday." `
`"It isn't from my family either. `
`And it isn't Rosa's or Maria-chan's." `
`"It can't be anyone in my family... `
`And it isn't Kanon-kun's or Shannon's. `
`...I always give the servants presents on their birthdays, so I know it for all of them, `
`but I don't know anyone who was born on November 29..." `
`Once we started imagining that the eight digits weren't meaningless, `
`but actually two dates written together, it really started to look that way. `
`...However, its true meaning may be something completely different, or there may be no meaning at all. `
`Anyway, since we don't have any real clues, it's probably pointless to stand around here worrying about it. `
`...The inside of the parlor's much more important. `
`This morning, behind each of the doors with a magic circle drawn on them...had been the body of a victim. `
`...So, if something new has been added to this door, does that mean something new {i:has been added} inside the parlor? `
`When Aunt Eva tried to open it, she felt the resistance of the lock. `
`She immediately took out a master key and put it in the keyhole. `
`As soon as she opened the door, ...Aunt Eva let out a high-pitched scream and ran inside. `
`That alone was enough to tell us what had happened inside the room... `
`Doctor Nanjo and I looked at each other, and I shook my head slightly as we entered the parlor... `
`"George!! `
`Geooooorge!! `
`Hang in there...!! `
`Geoooooooooorge!! `
`Doctor Nanjo, quickly!!" `
`George-aniki lay there crumpled alongside Shannon-chan's corpse. `
`His chest was stained bright red. `
`And judging by his still-opened eyes, `
`...I'd hate to say it to Aunt Eva, `
`...but I couldn't pick up any signs of life. `
`After moving to take George's pulse, `
`...Doctor Nanjo shook his head, wordlessly reporting that George was dead. `
`Brushing him aside, Aunt Eva once again crouched beside George-aniki... `
`and started crying at the top of her lungs... `
`With Aniki's death, ...one thing is certain. `
`The murders hadn't ended on the eighth twilight. `
`The epitaph was being carried out in its complete form, including the ninth twilight, "And none shall be left alive"... `
`I was really starting to lose track of things. `
`...For some reason, Aunt Eva's half-crazed cries actually made me cool down... `
`...Crestfallen and exhausted, I flopped onto the sofa `
`and plunked my feet on top of the table. `
`Maybe all these murders numbed my heart. `
`Instead of just being frightened, I felt completely confused. `
`Dad and Kyrie-san are dead, and people have been killed off one by one, starting with the servants. `
`...And there's been a hell of a lot of them by now. `
`I don't know when the first murder happened, `
`...but they might have been killed at a rate of about one person per hour by now. `
`We believe that the boat will come for us around 9:00 tomorrow. `
`...There's still a full 12 hours until then. `
`...How many more sacrifices to the witch will there have to be for us to survive...? `
`With the four of us, if one goes each hour, ...we won't last any longer than four hours. `
`We don't even know if we'll last until midnight tonight... `
`...Yesterday, after lunch, we came into this parlor. `
`Just as they started talking about serving some tea Aunt Rosa had bought, `
`we kids decided to take a walk. `
`...Maria was jumping around, wasn't she? `
`...Didn't Shannon-chan bring us some cookies? `
`She said Kumasawa-san had baked them, or something. `
`...It would've been hilarious if she'd baked some mackerel into them, wouldn't it? `
`......That's right, I'll never hear Kumasawa baa-chan's mackerel jokes again, will I...? `
`...Oh, right, if I only remember stuff about Kumasawa baa-chan, that wouldn't be fair to everyone else... `
`......Why did Dad and Kyrie-san...even go outside? `
`It's not like going without food for a day would kill us. `
`...So why did gluttony get ahold of them and make them go out for food? `
`...I'll bet that fearless dad of mine just started complaining about being hungry... `
`Kyrie-san, you were supposed to be the brakes for my reckless dad... `
`Why didn't you stop him? `
`......And...what about your daughter, Ange...? `
`She's still just six years old. `
`Don't tell me you planned to leave her in my care... `
`After all, it's doubtful now whether even I'll be able to leave this island alive...... `
`"S-Stop...!! `
`Why are you fighting at a time like this...?! `
`Jessica-san, stop...!!" `
`...It's been kinda noisy for a while. `
`By the time I looked up to see what it was, Jessica and Aunt Eva had suddenly started fighting each other. `
`...No, maybe I should say that Jessica was grabbing at Aunt Eva. `
`"...Aunt Eva killed Dad and the rest!! `
`There's no other explanation!!" `
`"How foolish!! `
`Why should I know anything about what happened to your parents?!" `
`"Who was on the first floor of the guesthouse?! `
`Aunt Eva!! `
`Dad and Mom were in the first floor lobby, along with her! `
`And who was left alive?! `
`Only Aunt Eva!! `
`Why?" `
`"It's obviously because you're the culprit!! `
`You killed Mom and Dad, carried them outside, and then shamelessly locked the door, `
`trying to make it seem like it was the witch's doing...!!" `
`"Then why did George go missing?! `
`He never came down to the first floor! `
`So, did he disappear from the second floor?! `
`And who was on the second floor?! `
`You people were, right?!! `
`You knew, didn't you?! `
`You knew that George slipped out of the guesthouse!! `
`And you brazenly acted as if you didn't know anything!! `
`If you'd stopped George, he'd be...he'd be...!!!" `
`"I said stop...! `
`Jessica-san was in the cousins' room the whole time! `
`And Eva-san was in the first floor lobby the whole time! `
`Neither of you is responsible for anything! `
`What we have here is simply the sadness of losing family members...!! `
`The culprit is no one, nowhere...!! `
`It is all......just the witch's fault!! `
`So stop hating each other, you two...!!" `
`...The witch's fault, huh...? `
`I wonder if that's a good way to cool down the situation right now. `
`Yeah, ...I finally understand why three people evaporated from the guesthouse...when all the doors and windows were {i:locked from the inside}... `
`This is what they were after. `
`...Making us think the culprit was inside...and sparking this ugly, mutual hatred... `
`has to be the culprit's...the witch's goal. `
`......But if that's the case, how did the culprit {i:lock it from the outside}...? `
`When Dad's group was attacked, their master key was definitely stolen. `
`...But the doors and windows to the guesthouse `
`were built so that you couldn't lock them from the outside, no matter how hard you tried. `
`So that master key should have had nothing to do with the guesthouse closed room... `
`Jessica and Aunt Eva were turning their sadness at losing their blood relatives into anger at the person in front of them. `
`Doctor Nanjo was trying to step between them. `
`......And I sat in the sofa, staring up at the ceiling, `
`...thinking about things that didn't even matter anymore with a worn out expression... `
`......I just couldn't believe that this was the same parlor that had been so warm and pleasant midday yesterday, `
`...for just a short time before the typhoon hit... `
`"Gyaaaaaaaaaaahhhh, `
`...uwaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh...!!" `
`The sudden sound of a gunshot shook me out of my half-asleep trance. `
`...Smoke was rising out of the barrel of the gun Aunt Eva held. `
`Jessica had fallen to the floor and was covering both her eyes. `
`Aunt Eva and Doctor Nanjo were looking down at her in shock... `
`"A-Are you okay, Jessica-san...?! `
`Jessica-san...!!" `
`"UuuAaaaAAAaaaaHHHaHHHhhh, `
`it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, `
`...rrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggghhh..." `
`"...I-It wasn't my fault... `
`...Th-This happened because you came at me even after I told you to stop...!" `
`"H-Hey, wait a sec, what's going on...?!" `
`So, did Jessica grab at Aunt Eva, which turned into a scuffle...? `
`Did they start fighting over Aunt Eva's gun? `
`Did some kind of impact cause the trigger to be pulled...? `
`I didn't know if the bullet had grazed her or if she'd been burned by the discharge, `
`but either way, Jessica was covering both of her eyes, screaming "It hurts, it hurts" and rolling around on the floor. `
`"...Don't worry, calm down...! `
`It is not a serious wound, so get ahold of yourself...!" `
`"My eyes hurt, it hurts... `
`...I can't see, `
`...I can't see...!!" `
`Doctor Nanjo let Jessica borrow his shoulder, saying that he would tend to her in the servant room. `
`...The servant room in this mansion had a bed and a first aid kit and was able to function as an infirmary. `
`"Damn iiiiiit!! `
`You killed Mom and Dad!! `
`I'll kill you, I'll kill you...!!" `
`"...I-It wasn't me, ...it wasn't me...!!" `
`"Jessica-san, you'll aggravate the wound, so don't move about...! `
`Come, let us go to the servant room..." `
`Jessica continued to curse Aunt Eva as her parents' murderer. `
`It seemed that Aunt Eva couldn't conceal her trembling at the fact that she had pulled the trigger, even if it had been an accident. `
`"...It wasn't my fault, ...it happened because that kid jumped at me... `
`...I didn't kill anyone... `
`...More importantly, ...who killed George? `
`That's right, who killed George?!! `
`George, Geooooooooooorge!! `
`It isn't my fault, it isn't my fault...!!" `
`"W-Wait a sec, Aunt Eva...!! `
`Don't go off on your own!!" `
`I didn't know if it was because Aunt Eva couldn't bear her mistake... `
`or if she'd given up control of her body to anger at the person who had killed her only son... `
`or if it was both of those all mixed together. `
`...At any rate, she ran out into the corridor, yelling, fearful, and screaming. `
`I was also worried about Jessica's condition, but right then, I couldn't leave Aunt Eva alone. `
`Why would she go off on her own in this mansion, of all places? Is she suicidal...?! `
`Doctor Nanjo took Jessica towards the servant room. `
`...I chased after Aunt Eva, dashing into the depths of the mansion... `
`After sitting Jessica on the servant room bed, `
`Nanjo told her several times not to touch her eyes and examined the affected area. `
`The barrel had probably been near her eyes. `
`There was a possibility that the flames from the discharge had injured her corneas. `
`...There was no threat to her life, but it would probably be necessary to take her to a doctor as soon as possible. `
`Nanjo applied emergency first aid, covering the affected area with gauze and wrapping it with a bandage. `
`As a result, Jessica completely lost her field of vision... `
`"Is that okay...? `
`The wound may hurt or itch, but you mustn't scratch at it or rub it. `
`When tomorrow comes, let us go to an ophthalmologist as soon as possible." `
`"...That bitch, she really was trying to kill me... `
`If the angle had been just a little bit off, I'd have been killed by now... `
`I'll definitely turn her in to the police...!" `
`"...Eva-san would not do such a thing. `
`That was an accident." `
`"You call that an accident...?! `
`She killed Dad and Mom. `
`There's no way any 19th person or witch exists on this island...!! `
`She's behind everything. `
`She was the only one on the first floor of the guesthouse!" `
`"George nii-san must have seen her kill Mom and Dad, and she killed him to keep him quiet!! `
`It's the same with Grandfather and the servants. `
`I'm sure she snuck out of the family conference last night and killed all of them...!!" `
`"...I-If that is indeed the case, then we'll find out about it as soon as the police investigate. `
`The police are incredible, and with their powers of discernment, there is nothing that cannot be understood. `
`...There is no need for us to suspect or hate anyone. `
`The police will resolve everything." `
`"So for now, Jessica-san, you should devote yourself to resting your body and keeping your eyes safe. `
`...Of course, if you wrinkle your forehead too much, it will do nothing good for your eyes, not to mention your beauty." `
`When Jessica's abuse of Eva had reached a crescendo, `
`she actually had started glaring instinctively, and the pressure on her eyes had hurt her. `
`Jessica herself realized that the more she talked, the more the wound would hurt, `
`and regardless of whether she'd overcome her suspicions of Eva, she regained her composure for the time being... `
`"......She killed them, `
`...Dad and Mom. `
`...And Shannon... `
`...and Kanon-kun... `
`Kanon-kun......" `
`She'd heard that Kanon had been killed in the chapel. `
`...Jessica still hadn't seen his face after he had died. `
`Jessica was now less fearful about the fact that she was blinded, `
`and more frightened that the police would carry Kanon's body away while she still couldn't see, `
`and that she would have to say her final farewell without being able to look at his face. `
`Her anger at the culprit...and her sadness at the death of the person she'd liked. `
`...Those mixed emotions started her crying. `
`But right now, tears were actually painful for her, `
`so she wasn't even permitted to leisurely remember his face in bygone days... `
`Jessica could do nothing but sit on the bed and let her head droop, withstanding the pain... `
`"...... `
`...Well then, now I am worried more about Eva-san. `
`I hope she isn't too shaken by this." `
`Realizing that Jessica had calmed down for the time being and letting out a sigh, `
`he stuck his head out into the hallway to look for any sign of the others coming back. `
`"......!" `
`Then, their eyes met. `
`Nanjo, unable to understand who this person was, was bewildered for an instant. `
`"I hear that people who have lost the power of sight have zero anti-magic power and magic resistance power. `
`In other words, you're an isolated pawn right now. `
`Understand what that means?" `
`"...Wh-What did you say...?" `
`Nanjo had no way of understanding who the person in front of him was, `
`much less what she had just said. `
`"......Doctor Nanjo? `
`What's going on...?" `
`Unable to see, Jessica had to rely on voices alone to make out the situation. `
`...But since she heard Nanjo say something in an uneasy tone, `
`she tightened up, thinking that something bad might have happened. `
`"...S-Stop, please...! `
`Please don't kill me...!! `
`I have a sick grandchild...! `
`I mustn't die here...! `
`Please, spare me...!! `
`Eeeek!!!" `
`"...Doctor Nanjo...? `
`Doctor Nanjo?!" `
`Jessica couldn't do anything except call out from the bed. `
`...Judging by the tone of his voice, Nanjo was in the corridor, confronting someone. `
`And he was scared. `
`His life must have been threatened just a second ago. `
`"No, stop it!! `
`Eeeeeeeeeeeeekkk!!!" `
`"On the ninth twilight, the witch shall revive, and none shall be left alive. `
`Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!!" `
`The witch pointed the end of her gold staff at Nanjo. `
`...Even though he didn't know what she was planning to do, `
`Nanjo assumed that she must be trying to take his life. `
`"Doctor Nanjo!! `
`Doctor Nanjo!! `
`Is someone there?! `
`Answer me!!" `
`"Stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit, ahiiieeeeeeeeehhh!!" `
`*bang*! `
`A sharp sound echoed. `
`And just as sharply, the tip of the golden staff tapered and stretched, slicing into Nanjo's forehead... `
`Jessica, who could only try to grasp what was happening with her ears, had no clue what was going on. `
`...But even so, she was able to realize that with that sound, Nanjo had died. `
`And, ...she could tell that that person was now in the corridor, right in front of the servant room. `
`...Furthermore, since she couldn't see, she wouldn't be able to run away, much less resist. `
`...Knowing that she was a mouse in a trap and in a life or death situation, Jessica shuddered... `
`"...Oh, Jessica. `
`Too bad, your eyes got injured. `
`...Now you can't even escape. `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle* `
`...I'm gonna play a whole lot with Nanjo's corpse now. `
`...When I get bored of that, I'll kill you next and play a bunch more." `
`"...No, wait, if I've got you here blind already... `
`...I won't wait until you're dead. `
`I'll have a lot of fun with you before I kill you too. `
`...Kuhhihyahyahyahya...!! `
`So wait there shaking for a while, okay? `
`As you try to imagine all the ways I'm playing with Nanjo's corpse!!" `
`"H‐...hiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!" `
`Jessica was struck with fear and let out a frail scream. `
`...She wanted to scream in a much louder voice, trying to get someone to help her. `
`But she couldn't. `
`When faced with true fear, it clogs up a person's throat... `
`Right then, Jessica could barely even breathe. `
`"H‐ `
`Help me, `
`...help me......!! `
`Eeeeeeeeeekk!!" `
`She searched around with her hands, trying to find some way to escape. `
`But even though she should have known this room well, just being unable to see made it like a closed room of darkness. `
`She ran into a shelf or something, and things like a candy jars and bottles fell down, hitting her on the head. `
`...As she was now, it would've been tough for her to even guard her head to block it. `
`...She was painfully aware of how powerless humans become just by losing their sense of sight. `
`Of course, she had no time to be impressed by this fact. `
`She crawled around at random, trying to escape from that place, `
`but she kept bumping into things that she didn't understand, getting hit by various falling objects, `
`and it felt like the entire room was alive, bullying her and refusing to let her escape. `
`Then, a footstep could be heard from that presence in the hallway. `
`And then, a voice. `
`...She'd probably poked her head into the room, since Jessica had been so loud. `
`"You really are noisy. `
`Act like a lady and wait there on the bed. `
`'Cause I'll give you a wonderful blood-red death outfit fitting for such an honored daughter. `
`...Something good enough to make the person who finds you faint, okay? `
`Gehheheheheheheheheheh!!" `
`"E-Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekkk!!" `
`Until just a second ago, she had sworn that she'd kill the culprit if she found them. `
`...However, she was now very powerless. `
`She couldn't do anything except let out a scream, crawling around on the floor and bumping her head into the bed and the legs of desks. `
`"Help me, ...help me...! `
`Someone, help me...!! `
`Dad, ...Mom...! `
`Battleeeer...! `
`Someone, coooooooome...!! `
`......Help me, ...Kanon-kun......!!" `
`In the corridor, as the witch thought of how to toy with Nanjo's life... `
`...A single gold butterfly secretly watched that scene from the corner of the hallway. `
`...It was Beato, who had barely escaped with her life once before. `
`The gold butterfly softly returned to human form. `
`...It was faint and transparent like a lace curtain. `
`By now, her power was so weak that even maintaining this form was difficult for her. `
`Right next to her, Ronove also appeared. `
`"...It is unlikely that Jessica will survive. `
`...Of course, there were to be no survivors from the very beginning." `
`".........She has grown feelings of love for Kanon. `
`...I have toyed with them at times. `
`......However, such behavior was shameful for a witch." `
`"...Love is the single element. `
`Romantic love is even more pure, more sacred. `
`...Though for some reason, you seem to despise it thoroughly, Milady." `
`"............ `
`...Teacher told me. `
`...Magic exists to bring people happiness. `
`...That's something I myself must have been aware of in the past." `
`"...Ever since I forgot that, I stopped being a witch. `
`...And so, ...I lost the right to be Battler's opponent..." `
`"......I can hardly believe it, Milady. `
`...Do you actually intend to rescue Jessica? `
`It will be dangerous." `
`"I know... `
`Even if I do save her, she will become a plaything of the witch's banquet when the door to the Golden Land opens. `
`...But even so, ...that death would be far more compassionate than what that person would do to her. `
`...The witch's banquet steals lives in a terrible way, but it does not do so more than once. `
`It does not toy with life and death." `
`"...However, that person is different. `
`She kills over and over. `
`She kills for fun! `
`There is not even a trace of compassion there. `
`......I want to at least save Jessica from that kind of cruel fate." `
`"...Certainly, by carrying that out, you would probably be praised as a good witch. `
`...However, the new {f:5:Beatrice}-sama already views you as hostile, Milady. `
`...If you were to be seen by her again, ...you would not have any method of escape this time, correct?" `
`".................. `
`...When I reunited George and Shannon, `
`......I finally understood what a witch is... `
`and what magic is." `
`"......I am a witch. `
`I must act as a witch. `
`And I must be acknowledged as Battler's opponent, ...and make Battler accept me as a witch this time around." `
`"...The road to that goal may be long and difficult. `
`...However, if I do not take a step forward here and now, ...I won't be able to call myself a witch." `
`"I understand your feelings, but how do you plan to rescue her? `
`There are not many forms of magic that your body is capable of now, Milady. `
`Did you not have to borrow George's power even back when you revived Shannon?" `
`"...Indeed. `
`...And for that very reason, I may be able to save Jessica. `
`...Right now, she is begging for Kanon to save her. `
`...If I can borrow the power of that emotion, my magic may be able to knock on the doors of the Land of the Dead once again." `
`"You may be able to knock. `
`However, you would use up all of your magical energy. `
`...If you were to be spotted by the new {f:5:Beatrice}-sama, you would truly be without a method of escape. `
`...I am no longer your butler, Milady. `
`...Understand that I cannot assist you if the situation worsens." `
`"...I know. `
`......By now, I have toyed with and taken more lives than I can count. `
`...So, I may not be able to make up for it...except by saving the same number of lives, bringing them through that door." `
`"...I have had nothing to lose in the first place. `
`...I am just a gold butterfly who has passed its name and magic power on, and who is no longer acknowledged as a witch." `
`"......What about Battler-sama? `
`You are partway through a game with him. `
`He has said that he would wait until you returned. `
`...Are you truly satisfied to end it here? `
`...You have a duty to return to the seat across from Battler-sama, Milady." `
`"For that very reason...! `
`If there's a life that only I can save, I will save it. `
`And I will be accepted as a witch. `
`...I must become a witch...! `
`If this is training, it is a very childish thing, nothing that compares with the evils I have committed before now." `
`"...Vanish, Ronove. `
`Watch what may be the final magic of a single butterfly who used to be called a witch...!" `
`"...Certainly. `
`...Please show me magic... `
`...that will not disgrace the name of the Golden Witch. `
`...And I pray that it is not your final spell." `
`"Go, my friend. `
`...If you can find enough ink, write down the story of my foolish life...and hand it over to some fool who is about to walk down the same path. `
`So long, Ronove...!" `
`"Kanon‐kun, `
`...where are you...? `
`Where are you...? `
`...Help me, `
`...help me, `
`...aaaaaaaaahhh..." `
`......Milady, `
`I am...always there by your side. `
`"...K-Kanon-kun...? `
`Kanon-kun...?!" `
`It seemed to Jessica as though she'd heard Kanon's voice just then. `
`She looked around with unseeing eyes, but of course, she saw nothing. `
`...On the contrary, that action caused her head to hit the desk again. `
`"...Kanon-kun, ......Kanon-kun... `
`...Help me, ......help me......" `
`Yes, Milady. `
`...I will...help you. `
`"...K-Kanon-kun...?! `
`Y-You survived...?!" `
`This time, she thought she heard his voice clearly. `
`Jessica jumped up in surprise, banging her head against the desk once again. `
`...Milady, please, calm your heart and listen. `
`...Unfortunately, I am not alive. `
`"......Huh...?" `
`I have already...died. `
`...However, ...that witch came to me to tell me of your peril. `
`...And...she gave me just a little bit of time...so that I could save you, Milady. `
`Please, calm your heart even more. `
`If you do, ...my form will become visible even to you, Milady... `
`Jessica obeyed those words. `
`She chased all idle thoughts from her head and relaxed her breathing. `
`...Of course, her heart felt like it was going to explode after hearing the voice of the one she'd liked and had thought was dead. `
`She resisted the excitement with all her strength. `
`...When she did, ...she felt as though Kanon-kun really was right in front of her. `
`...Even though she shouldn't have been able to see him with her eyes, ...she was able to sense him clearly. `
`"...Can you...see me? `
`Milady..." `
`"Yeah... `
`I can see. ...I can definitely see you, Kanon-kun..." `
`"......I exist only as as a soul now. `
`So I cannot touch you, Milady. `
`I cannot do anything except talk to you like this. `
`...With my current weak existence, I can do nothing more than that, ...but I should be able to be of some aid to you, Milady." `
`"...So, ...we can only talk...? `
`I can't...touch you, Kanon-kun...?" `
`"I am now more fragile than smoke from a candle. `
`...So much so that if one of the living such as you were to touch me, I would be wiped away instantly. `
`...So please, don't try to touch me. `
`...Because I am also...holding back my desire...to touch you, Milady." `
`"Ah, ......o-okay..." `
`"More importantly, Milady, `
`...please listen well. `
`......The new Golden Witch has a cruel heart. `
`...She surely plans to make you meet with a horrible fate. `
`...You must escape from this room and hide." `
`"...H-How...? `
`I can't...see anything...!" `
`"Quiet... `
`...I will be your eyes, Milady. `
`Please move in accordance with my instructions. `
`...First, please crawl three steps from there, then stand up. `
`You are now under the desk, Milady. `
`If you stand there, you'll hit your head." `
`"...Th-That was under the desk...? `
`Okay, 1, 2, 3... `
`...I'm gonna stand..." `
`"Well done... `
`Next, please turn to face towards 9 o'clock. `
`......Yes, well done." `
`"Ha, ...haha... `
`This is pretty...embarrassing... `
`...Ah, ...ack, ...owowow..." `
`"Are you okay? Does your wound hurt...?" `
`"N-No, ...I'm fine... `
`What next...?" `
`Jessica thought that if this was a dream, she didn't want to wake up. `
`...And, if she were allowed to, she would've wanted to take off the bandage covering her eyes and see him. `
`...However, if she did that, Kanon might vanish like frail candle smoke, just like he himself had said... `
`...She was afraid of that. `
`So she satisfied herself with just listening to his words once more, `
`repressing her desire to see him, to hold him. `
`Therefore, what hurt her eyes now were tears of gratitude. `
`...Tears of gratitude for the god...or maybe the witch...who had given her this miraculous moment. `
`"...Is this okay...? `
`If we keep talking like this, won't we be noticed by her? `
`Won't our voices be heard...?" `
`"...I have erected a secrecy barrier. `
`As long as we don't make any loud sounds or speak noisily, no one will notice us. `
`...That's why people can't tell when I'm around." `
`"...I-I don't really get it, ...but anyway, we'll be fine as long as we stay quiet, right...? `
`...Wh-What should I do next...?" `
`"Please walk 10 steps in that direction. `
`You will touch the sofa. `
`Please continue along that. `
`...Do it slowly. `
`...Stay calm. `
`Believe in my words." `
`"...S-Sure. `
`......Heheh, ...it's weird... `
`...Even though it's so scary not being able to see, ......I'm not scared at all if you're with me, Kanon-kun..." `
`"......Yes, that is the sofa. `
`Trace it to the left while advancing slowly... `
`There is a table just to your left. `
`Be careful not to bump into it with your shins..." `
`...It was a very, very strange and bizarre team effort. `
`Even though she would have been killed in an instant if the terrible witch noticed her, `
`...there was no fear in Jessica's heart. `
`She was being protected and guided by Kanon, someone she thought she'd never be reunited with. `
`...It would probably be just a momentary miracle. `
`...Even so, Jessica was deeply grateful for it. `
`If she hoped for too much, she was sure that he would disappear, so she tried not to ruin this faint miracle. `
`And, trying to engrave this moment into her heart for all eternity, she slowly, slowly...continued to walk, obeying Kanon's voice... `
`"...Okay, if you walk 10 more steps, you will exit the servant room. `
`Then, please turn to face 9 o'clock, and keep walking very slowly. `
`Put your hand on the wall to your right, and keep on following that. `
`...I will take you to a safe room." `
`"............If I go there, `
`...will you... `
`leave, Kanon-kun...?" `
`"............" `
`Kanon didn't answer. `
`...But his lack of an answer was enough to tell her the truth. `
`"...Then, ...no way. `
`......I don't want to go..." `
`"If you stay here, you will be killed by the witch." `
`"I don't mind... `
`If I'm killed, I can go to the world where you are, Kanon-kun..." `
`"...Milady, `
`please listen to me. `
`...The human world is too bright and painful for the dead, like me... `
`So I cannot stay for long." `
`"So Milady, ...please allow me to use what time I am allowed...to guide you to a safe place. `
`......Because after that, ......I will stay with you until my time runs out." `
`"......Is that...the very best you can manage, Kanon-kun...?" `
`"...Yes. `
`......In exchange, I will stay by your side as long as possible. `
`...I will stay with you...and talk with you, Milady." `
`"Talk...about what...?" `
`"......What do you want to talk about...?" `
`"...I don't care what, as long as you're willing to tell me, Kanon-kun..." `
`"...Well then... `
`......I will tell you the story of a cowardly servant boy who lacked all courage. `
`......The story of a foolish and pitiful boy who fell in love with a young lady as radiant as the sun. ...Even when the lady confessed those same feelings to him, `
`...he lost to his cowardice...and was never able to be honest with his feelings while he still lived." `
`"......Yes... `
`Then, ...I want to tell you a story too. `
`......It's the story of a cowardly girl...who couldn't muster the courage... `
`to tell the boy she loved how she felt...much, much more often. `
`......The story of how that girl, after being reunited with that boy by a miracle from god, `
`......used that chance to finally muster up her courage." `
`"......I also...want to hear that. `
`...So, for that reason as well, let us go. `
`...To a safe place." `
`"...Yeah... `
`If I could be with you, Kanon-kun, I would walk however far, however long it took... `
`I don't need eyes anymore. `
`If you tell me to step forward, I will take that step, even if it leads off a cliff." `
`"Thank you. `
`...Come, Milady. `
`Let us go. `
`The first 10 steps." `
`"No, I don't like it. `
`......I won't do it...unless you call me Jessica." `
`"...Understood. `
`.........Well then, Jessica. `
`...Take the first 10 steps." `
`"Yes, `
`Kanon-kun..." `
`Very quietly, Jessica and Kanon slowly snuck out of the servant room. `
`Just around the corner, the witch could be seen cruelly looking down at Nanjo's corpse, `
`but she didn't even notice their presence. `
`However, Ronove, who stood at the ready by her side, met Kanon's eyes. `
`...Kanon thought "Oh no", grimacing and blocking Jessica with his back. `
`"............" `
`However, Ronove did not inform his master. `
`He played dumb, just as though he hadn't spotted Kanon in the first place. `
`...No, maybe he did appear to chuckle. `
`From a finger on Ronove's hands, which were joined behind his back, a single small gold butterfly appeared, `
`flying in front of Kanon as though guiding him. `
`It went unnoticed by the master he served. `
`Kanon was surprised at the magic that butterfly held. `
`Because it was far more powerful than the secrecy barrier Kanon possessed. `
`...He may not have known it, but that power of his had originally been Ronove's. `
`...Kanon's ability was an imitation of that, which Kinzo had made and given to him. `
`As that butterfly of secrecy magic scattered gold scales, it grew smaller bit by bit. `
`...It probably wouldn't last long. `
`...But without a doubt, even that would buy them enough time to get them far away from the cruel witch. `
`"Okay, Milady... `
`Let's follow that wall and keep walking. `
`...Keep going. `
`Keep going." `
`"Yeah. `
`...If I can be with you Kanon-kun, ...I'll keep on going, on and on..." `
`Led and protected by the small gold butterfly, `
`...the pair separated by the wall of life and death slowly walked away, towards the end of the corridor... `
`...There was no way that the evil witch could have had magic to notice their flight. `
`Until they disappeared at the other end of the corridor, the witch didn't realize that Jessica had vanished... `
`By the time the gold butterfly Ronove had sent evaporated completely, ...Jessica had reached the parlor. `
`Even though it would have been a quick trip if she'd been able to see, as she was now, it had been a very long adventure. `
`"...Come, Milady. `
`We've reached the parlor. `
`I will now take you to the bundle of curtains by the window. `
`If you hide in there, you'll surely be safe." `
`"Inside the curtains... `
`Not bad. `
`I used to hide in there a lot, long ago." `
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}-sama..." `
`"...Huh?" `
`Kanon called out the witch's name. `
`Jessica looked around in surprise, but she obviously couldn't spot the witch when she couldn't see... `
`Beato had appeared once again with a faint form. `
`Kanon squared off against the figure of the evil witch, but Beato's expression was soft, ...or even pitying. `
`"......I don't know what sort of whim led you to revive me, nor do I understand what you're thinking now." `
`"...Oh, it was nothing more than a whim. `
`...No, ...this is how witches should be. `
`...It took me a thousand years to realize that. `
`...That is how...foolish it is." `
`"Wh-Who is it?! `
`Who's there...?!" `
`"...Milady, be quiet. `
`...She is the witch, ...{f:5:Beatrice}... `
`......I owe her, ...because she let me be with you one more time." `
`"......The witch, ...{f:5:Beatrice}..." `
`"...Forget about me. `
`More importantly, you should quickly hide that girl in the shadows of the curtains. `
`......You probably do not have much time left. `
`You may spend it having a final conversation with Jessica." `
`"...A secret meeting inside a bunch of curtains? ...How clever you two are. `
`*cackle*cackle*..." `
`"U-Umm, ......thank you, {f:5:Beatrice}...!! `
`Thank you for letting me be with Kanon-kun...!!" `
`Jessica didn't know where Beato was, so she said that while facing in the wrong direction. `
`Perhaps because she found that funny, Beato snickered. `
`"I will now leave this room to the pair of lovers. `
`Evil witches have no need for tales of love. `
`Allow me to depart." `
`"...{f:5:Beatrice}-sama, `
`...thank you very much." `
`"Hmph, `
`......there is no need to thank me. `
`You know that something like this cannot compensate for all of the evil I have done." `
`"I offer my gratitude to this good witch as a parting gift. `
`...I don't know what has happened before or what will happen later. `
`...However, at this very moment, `
`...you are without a doubt...a good witch." `
`"...You flatter me, furniture. `
`The next time we meet, I may be an evil witch who doesn't betray your expectations. `
`...And with that, farewell." `
`Beato left the parlor and closed the door. `
`And, mustering the last of her remaining magical power, she sealed the door. `
`The fact that those two had escaped into here would eventually be noticed. `
`...And now that the ninth twilight had been reached, no matter how much they struggled, their inescapable fate had already been decided. `
`However, until that final moment, they should be given the chance to speak with each other of their love. `
`The witch poured out all of her magical power to protect their time together. `
`...So that no one would be able to defile their time alone until the last possible moment. `
`At that time, ...Beato noticed something. `
`...Her body had been detected by a magical searching technique. `
`...The evil witch's furniture had sniffed this place out. `
`"......So, boorishness is the witch's way of doing things after all... `
`To think that she doesn't even intend to let those two young ones speak together of their love...... `
`...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!!" `
`"45, Data Received. `
`Checking Target, Confirmed as the Predecessor Lady {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`Analyzing Parlor Defensive Wall. `
`72-Layered Multilayered Defensive Wall, Attack-Proof Barrier and Anti-Magic Armor. `
`Sniping into the parlor will be impossible. `
`Data Link to 410." `
`"410, Data Received. Nihi! `
`Then we've just gotta kill Predecessor-sama first, nyeh. `
`Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}, your Firing Permission please!" `
`"Go ahead and shoot. `
`...Oh, and avoid her vital areas. `
`There's something I want to ask that old hag." `
`"410, Firing. `
`Nihi!" `
`The Chiester Sisters' gold bow released a gold snake. `
`...It crawled down the corridor starting from the front of the servant room, aiming for the parlor as it drew a soft, snake-like curved line trajectory, `
`...and pierced Beato's chest. `
`".........Gwaah...!!!" `
`Gold butterflies gathered, and the cruel witch appeared along with her furniture. `
`"...Predecessor-sama, `
`no further obstructions will be permitted." `
`"...Ugh...uu...... I didn't think they would be... `
`...Still, the Chiester Sisters really have gotten rusty. `
`To think that they failed to bring me down. `
`...And twice, at that...!" `
`Ronove spoke in a manner befitting the witch's butler. `
`As she pushed her pain aside, Beato grinned and spoke back. `
`"M-My apologies, Predecessor-sama...! `
`We were ordered to avoid vital areas...!" `
`"As soon as we get the order, we can pierce you at any time. `
`We can pierce a hole in your ears, a hole in your belly button, any hole you like. `
`Nihi!" `
`The gold snake that had pierced {f:5:Beatrice} grew even longer, drawing a funnel-shaped helix and awaiting its next order. `
`...It was prepared to pierce a vital spot as soon as the evil witch told it to. `
`"......For what reason would someone like you, who is no less brutal than I, `
`make them avoid my vital areas? `
`New {f:5:Beatrice}...!!" `
`"I wanted to ask you something. `
`...I don't know what kind of trick you used to escape, but we thought we took you out, right? `
`Why is it that even though you could've escaped by hiding, you took the risk of appearing again? `
`...It can't be that you came back just to protect those two young people, riight?" `
`"...Well, ...who knows? `
`...*cackle*cackle*...!" `
`"And just a second ago. `
`Why'd you do something as soft as reviving the lovers and reuniting them? `
`...The more I hear about you, the more I learn that I don't even reach up to your feet as an incarnation of evil. `
`If you're like that, why did you suddenly start acting so mildly? `
`...That's what I wanted to ask." `
`"......*cackle*cackle*! `
`I am brutal, therefore I am fickle. `
`What purpose could questioning that possibly serve?" `
`"Chiester Sisters, sew her." `
`When she ordered that, the gold snake that was curled in a helix and suspended in space... `
`moved as fast as a real snake going after its prey... `
`and pierced Beato's body multiple times from both sides, its gold tail drawing a x shape. `
`As the cruel witch had ordered, it drew a cross-stitch through Beato's chest. `
`The gold thread made a squeaking sound and tormented Beato... `
`Rather than a gold snake searching for its prey, `
`it waited for orders like a sewing needle ready to sew Beato. `
`"If it's you we're talking about, there's no way it could've been a whim. `
`...I've heard about you. `
`And I've learned. `
`You're such an incarnation of evil that I don't even rise up to your feet. `
`I thought I was truly a fitting successor to you." `
`"...But you've always been in the way. `
`You always say warm, pleasant things that shock me. `
`...What changed you? `
`You explored the depths of evil for one thousand years, `
`and I let you live...because I wanted to know what happened to make you change so much." `
`"...If you really want to know, then I suggest you waste a thousand years as well. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"Sew." `
`"Gwaahhhh!!! `
`Ackkah, ...gah!!" `
`Beato's chest was once again sewn with a golden cross-stitch. `
`It tightened once again, squeezing fresh blood from Beato's chest. `
`The intense pain it caused ran in conflict with its beauty to the eye. `
`"......You might be one of those things that disappear when they die and don't leave a corpse. `
`So I'll kill you slowly. `
`But if you answer my questions honestly, I'll let you die easy. `
`I'll give you a splendid, gorgeous death, perfect for my Predecessor-sama. `
`I'll sink you in a coffin filled with water and roses. `
`Isn't that wonderful? `
`...And you still won't talk? `
`About the reason for your change of heart?" `
`"*cackle*cackle*...!! `
`Not answering when she is asked is another one of an evil witch's pleasures." `
`"Sew. Twice." `
`"Gyoah, gwuaahh......!!" `
`"Of course, you don't have to answer. `
`After all, that way I get to torture you. `
`Kuukuhihihihihihihihihihi!!" `
`"The Endless Magic truly is wonderful. `
`...When you think about it, this world is limited in every way. `
`The endless cannot exist in the human world. `
`Because gods are without limits, the human world is deprived of all limitlessness, so that they can be looked down upon." `
`"...So, in other words, this endless power is the power of the gods! `
`A wonderful power where, the more you play with it, the more fun ways of playing you find! `
`You used that power as you pleased for one thousand years and went on a rampage! `
`Why are you having a change of heart only now? `
`You aren't gonna say you regret handing it over to me, are you?" `
`"How could I regret it? `
`The Endless Magic you believe in is no magic at all. `
`...True magic lies in a deep abyss that you most certainly cannot reach." `
`"And this is what you realized...? `
`Then what...is it?" `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*! `
`Wander about for a thousand years without realizing, foolish witch." `
`"Sew. Three times this time." `
`"Gwoah, gyuooh, ...gu...!!!" `
`Beato's chest had been embroidered with the gold thread. `
`It tightened even more, causing Beato more and more pain... `
`"...Well, that's fine. `
`I'm no longer curious about what kind of revelations an old hag who refuses to die might've had. `
`I'm bored now, so I'll just kill you. `
`If I do, the barrier around the parlor will dissolve." `
`"...Then I'll torture Kanon and Jessica to death a whole bunch of times. `
`...Being able to have two lovers as my toys at the same time...sounds pretty fun, right? `
`Kuhhihihhihhihihihhihihihihi!!" `
`"Kill her...!!!" `
`Without missing by a millimeter, the gold sewing thread shot through Beato's heart... `
`That intense pain was worse than all of the pain before that put together. `
`Beato finally remembered the actual feeling of dying, which she had forgotten over the course of a thousand years... `
`But......she couldn't die. `
`She must not die. `
`If she died, it would mean handing over the two in the parlor to the cruel witch. `
`So she definitely couldn't die. `
`She resolutely...refused to die...! `
`"......New {f:5:Beatrice}, `
`...I have a request. `
`......The lover's meeting between the two in the parlor will not last long. `
`......In the amount of time an hourglass can measure, Kanon will probably vanish into the Land of the Dead. `
`...Would you please allow them at least that much time...?" `
`"No waay. `
`Isn't tearing apart two who love each other fun? `
`You said it yourself. `
`So I want to try it!" `
`"...*cackle*cackle*... `
`In that case, I mustn't allow you that pleasure... `
`*cackle*cackle* Yes, it can be fun, tearing apart lovers." `
`"Really? `
`I'm sure it is fun. `
`So don't get in my way!! `
`Sew more! `
`Sew, sew, sew!!" `
`"Nihi! `
`410, Understoood!!" `
`The merciless gold sewing needle sewed the gold thread through Beato's heart over and over again. `
`...However, no matter how much it tightened, that heart did not stop... `
`"Nng, ...aaaaahhh, ...this isn't nearly enough... `
`I won't die by something like this...!!" `
`"What are you doing? `
`Make this old hag shut up. `
`Kill her quickly!" `
`"...W-We're killing her...!! `
`Even though we've sewn her heart in place several times, `
`...this person's heart...w-won't stop...!!" `
`"...Are you...immortal?" `
`"Of course not. `
`...I've handed the endless over to you. `
`My heart will not beat many more times." `
`"...However, if by making it beat just once more, I can give the two in this room a bit more time, `
`...I'll continue that resistance for all eternity!!" `
`"Sew!! `
`Keep sewing until her heart stops moving!!" `
`"Guuh, guooooh, gwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!" `
`"...Wh-Why doesn't she die?! `
`It's impossible...!!" `
`"Why...isn't her heart stopping... `
`even though it's been sewn in place?!" `
`"Who cares, we'll make the heart explode from the inside nyeh...! `
`How pitiful, and you could've died cleanly if you hadn't resisted us!!" `
`As they said that, even though the gold needle and thread made round trips over and over again, Beato still didn't die... `
`The cruel witch eventually grew pale at how bizarre that was. `
`"......What in the world...are you...?" `
`"...*cackle*cackle*cackle* `
`...You probably cannot understand. `
`...Even I didn't understand. `
`...And yet, `
`...somehow or another, it seems that this is true magic. `
`.........In other words, `
`...I have now... `
`become it. `
`...I have become... `
`a true witch!!" `
`"Fixing Explosion Center in Heart Interior. `
`Fuse Preparations Ready!" `
`"Explode!!!" `
`There was a terrible sound......and gold leaf was scattered around the area, along with a cloud of gold butterflies. `
`Beato's chest had opened wide from the inside, `
`...and from that, gold butterflies and gold leaf poured out, staining the surrounding area gold... `
`Then, Beato's flesh crumpled. `
`Like a puppet whose strings had been cut, ...she crouched down...and crumpled. `
`...However, a gold heart tied by gold threads floated in the air...and continued to beat... `
`"......Wh-What the......eeeeeek..." `
`"M-Monster, ...eeeeeeeeep...!" `
`When the Chiester Sisters saw that, they fell on their butts in shock. `
`...Somehow, even though Beato had become nothing more than a heart, it still kept beating, `
`continuing to protect the barrier to the parlor. `
`...It was an immeasurably vast magical power. `
`...Impossible to measure. `
`In other words, endless. `
`"......I-I'm the Endless Witch, right...? `
`......Why is this old hag...still alive...after all this...?!! `
`Chiester Sisters!! `
`Smash that heart!! `
`Quickly!!" `
`"I-It's impossible, my apologies! `
`We can't do it!!" `
`"......Indeed, it probably will be impossible. `
`No number of people could crush that heart. `
`...And certainly not the soldiers who serve under His Highness the Dragon King." `
`"In that case, `
`an Endless Witch like me should be able to crush it, right? `
`My power is that of a god!!" `
`"I am afraid to say... `
`that your power cannot `
`leave a single wound on the Endless of {i:Beatrice-sama}." `
`"...Just what...do you mean by that...?" `
`"Just as there can be no light without knowledge of shadows, `
`...there can be no infinite without knowledge of the finite. `
`......Before Milady {f:5:Beatrice}'s true endless power, your frail magic is quite, quite lacking." `
`"What is......that... `
`...aah-" `
`The cruel witch was surprised and stepped back. `
`It was thinner than a lace curtain... `
`...no, {i:Beatrice}'s form was still standing there. `
`Even after being laid bare so tragically like this, ...she refused to let evil through that door. `
`At that time, ...a shadow just as thin as {f:5:Beatrice} stood behind her. `
`It was Kanon. `
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}-sama, `
`...thank you very much. `
`...I won't forget what you've done for us." `
`"...Hmph. `
`...I'll hear those words of yours once the number of my blessings has surpassed the number of grievances I have caused. `
`...Was that long enough?" `
`"Yes. `
`......Truly, thank you very much. `
`...And {f:5:Beatrice}-sama, `
`...you have also done enough. `
`...Please, `
`...be at peace..." `
`"...Is that so? `
`...Is this...enough...? `
`......Ha, ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*..." `
`"What's going on...? `
`...Why are you guys calling that old hag {f:5:Beatrice}?! `
`{f:5:Beatrice} is my name, right?! `
`It's got to be, since I'm the new Golden Witch and Endless Witch, right?!" `
`"......How rude. `
`How dare you claim {f:5:Beatrice}-sama's name." `
`"I am afraid to say... `
`that the name of {f:5:Beatrice}-sama belongs to the one crowned as the Endless Witch. `
`Right now, you are the Predecessor. `
`...Pukkukukukuku." `
`"What...did you say...?" `
`"......Farewell, Kanon. `
`...I'm sure I'll see you soon enough. `
`In a new nightmare." `
`"......In the nightmare of a new night, I will once again be your companion, {f:5:Beatrice}-sama... `
`...With that, ...if you would excuse me..." `
`Kanon's form grew faint, ...and he disappeared into thin air. `
`After watching him go, ...{f:5:Beatrice}'s form also grew faint, ...and before disappearing, it slumped over onto the floor. `
`Then, ...there was a *splat*. `
`The golden heart that had been floating in midair...lost its sparkle, became bloodstained flesh, and fell to the ground. `
`...How frail it was. `
`It was ragged and full of holes. `
`...But until a moment ago, it had sparkled so much, had continued to beat so forcefully. `
`That heart still just barely managed to beat. `
`...However, it was only a matter of time before it stopped. `
`{f:5:Beatrice}, whose form had become fragile and faint like incense smoke, lay on the floor, `
`...steadily watching her own heart... `
`There, the cruel witch could be seen... `
`"...Wh-What do you mean, endless...? `
`Aren't you actually collapsed in a heap right there?! `
`How can there be a finite infinity? ...That's a contradiction, it couldn't exist! `
`This is the limit of your magic! `
`The endless is better than the finite!!" `
`"............" `
`{f:5:Beatrice} no longer even had the will to respond. `
`...No, on the contrary, it was doubtful that the words of the cruel witch even reached her ears... `
`"If you're a real Endless Witch, try standing up!! `
`How's it going? `
`You can't stand, can you?! `
`Why do you think you can't stand?! `
`It's because you aren't the Endless Witch!!" `
`The cruel witch poked {f:5:Beatrice}'s heart with her fingernail. `
`{f:5:Beatrice} had no words with which to respond to that provocation. `
`...However, ...instead of words, she returned a single expression. `
`...It felt humiliating only to the cruel witch. `
`Because she had gently curved her mouth...and smiled. `
`...Footsteps were approaching that place. `
`There was no way she had misheard it. `
`...That rough squeaking of heels was the sound of Battler's footsteps... `
`"......Battler, is it......? `
`......Ha, ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*... `
`...After talking so tough, ...I ended up like this..." `
`".................." `
`"......I've been trying to become... `
`...the true witch you talked about... `
`...in my own way..." `
`"...Yeah. `
`...I was watching." `
`"......Hey, `
`...have I... `
`...been able to become... `
`...a witch...? `
`...Have I earned... `
`...the right to become your opponent...?" `
`"It's useless." `
`Battler said it unbelievably bluntly. `
`As {f:5:Beatrice} breathed painfully, she saw this and sneered at herself, as though she should have expected it. `
`"......Ha, ...*cackle*... `
`...I see. `
`...Yes, the road to becoming a true witch will be much, much longer than this..." `
`"...However, ...I will not surrender... `
`...Just like you never surrendered to my torture, `
`......I will definitely...become a true witch... `
`and be...accepted as your opponent..." `
`"Yeah, it's useless. `
`It's all useless. `
`You aren't my opponent." `
`The cruel witch raised her foot high... `
`...Below it was {f:5:Beatrice}'s frail heart. `
`"Die, you old hag!! `
`Let's see how endless you are when you've been crushed to a pulp!! `
`I'm the witch! `
`I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!! `
`Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieee!!" `
`{e:170:"Yeeeeeahhhh, it's no good, it's no goddamn good at aaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaall!!!"} `
`"Wh-What... `
`...is this...? `
`...Wh-Where is this...?" `
`"Get in your seat. `
`Beato isn't my opponent. `
`......You are." `
`"...B-Battler...?! `
`What kind of magic is this?! `
`Who cares, it doesn't matter!! `
`Chiester Sisters!!" `
`"45, understood, attacking everywhere!!" `
`"410, understood. Die, Battler!!" `
`The Chiester Sisters each readied their own golden bows and fired golden arrows. `
`The two only pulled the bowstring together when using precision guidance. `
`If they were fighting against an enemy before their eyes, they fired their bows at the same time. `
`And their might did not suffer in the slightest. `
`"Wha, ......i-i-it was deflected?!?! `
`There's no barrier, it was deflected by resistance alone... `
`Uh, 45, Target Analysis!!" `
`"45, understood... `
`......Huh, ...whaaaat...?! `
`D-Did I...break down? `
`Am I insane...? `
`A-Anti-Magic Resistance Power, Endless Nine... `
`E-Even mythical-class magical attacks won't be effective against the target!!" `
`Golden bow warheads could penetrate any magical armor through reciprocal corrosion. `
`When one tried to block them with anti-magic resistance power, even eight digits were not sufficient to prevent their penetration. `
`...By the way, even famous gods that appear in myths rarely reach as high as nine digits. `
`For that reason, nine digits were enough to measure pretty much all sensible values. `
`...Battler had buried all 9 of those digits with nines... `
`"...How foolish. `
`When Battler-sama gets serious, magical arrows and the like aren't enough to even make his hair tremble." `
`The Chiester Sisters dropped their golden bows in shock... `
`...To Battler himself, it was as though a pair of dragonflies had flown past his shoulder. `
`"......What are you doing? `
`Is that some kind of game?" `
`"...Eeeeeeek, `
`...m-monster..." `
`"Stay back, small fries!! `
`Get in your seat, fake witch!! `
`I'll tear off that mask of yours!!!" `
`""E-Eeeeeeeeeeeeeek!!"" `
`The Chiester Sisters couldn't hide their fear at Battler's ferocity, and they backed up as though they'd been struck. `
`{f:5:Beatrice} watched this scene in shock... `
`"...B-Battler, `
`...what...is this supposed to be...?" `
`"Just like you see. `
`You aren't my opponent. `
`She is!! `
`That impostor over there, who's using your name!!!" `
`"Ack...!" `
`"...I'm fighting against a witch. `
`...I face off against an opponent who claims to be a witch, and I deny witches by defeating them. `
`...I've seen more than enough of your arrogance." `
`Then, Battler's eyes grew as sharp as blades as he stared down the cruel witch. `
`"...What are you calling magic? `
`What are you calling witches?! `
`You're no witch!! `
`I'll rip that mask off and tear it to shreds!! `
`{f:5:Virgilia}, get ready to fight!!" `
`"Understood. `
`Preparations are complete, so go whenever you're ready. `
`...{f:5:Beatrice}, `
`stay back and rest." `
`"I-Indeed..." `
`Beato looked at Battler timidly. `
`...She still hadn't been acknowledged as his opponent. `
`Was she qualified to watch the game board from the sidelines...? `
`"Beato, stay back and watch!! `
`I'll tear it off!! `
`I'll thoroughly dismantle this fake witch!! `
`I won't let someone like this call themselves a witch!! `
`You protected the honor of true witches!" `
`"I-I, umm..." `
`"You don't need to say anything. `
`On your behalf, I'll teach her that the name of the Golden Witch definitely isn't that cheap!!" `
`"......B-Battler..." `
`"Those are the general rules." `
`"......Thank you, Ronove. `
`I get most of the rules now. `
`...I see. `
`You can't win with magic, so you came to face off with me in a world where victory is decided by something other than magic." `
`"...Foolish people. `
`Do you really think you can win against me with twisted logic?!" `
`"Yeah, I do. `
`I'll crush all of your twisted logic, Aunt Eva!!" `
`"I-I am not Eva...!! `
`That is the name of the old shell I shed. `
`I am a true witch, born inside of her...!!" `
`"Don't try to trick me! Your true form isn't a witch or anything like it, but a flesh and blood human. `
`The human culprit, Ushiromiya Eva!!! `
`{f:5:Virgilia}, reconstruct the second twilight!!" `
`"Understood. `
`On the second twilight, Rosa and Maria were killed in the rose garden. `
`We begin by applying the "Eva Culprit Theory" for that case." `
`"Huuh? `
`Ridiculous! `
`Come, arise, try to remember! `
`What form did Ushiromiya Hideyoshi have?!!" `
`"Whaat? `
`What's this supposed to be?" `
`"...It's a summoning of the dead. `
`A witch can easily bring even the dead up to the stand for testimony..." `
`On the opposing side, a transparent Uncle Hideyoshi was summoned. `
`...Talk about convenient. `
`He looked as though he couldn't see what was going on here, almost like a person on the other side of the TV. `
`"Witness summons. `
`Ushiromiya Hideyoshi's testimony. `
`Come, Hideyoshi, speak...!" `
`"...I was taking care of Eva in our room the whole time. `
`Of course, Eva didn't leave the room." `
`"Aunt Eva. `
`Around here, testimony that isn't red isn't worth crap. `
`I demand that he repeats it again in red!!" `
`"Oh yeah, that's right. `
`Sure, say it in red!" `
`" `
`{p:1:I was in the room the whole time}. `
`{p:1:Both before and after the time period of the crime}." `
`"See, look. `
`This makes it impossible for Eva to be the culprit, right?! `
`How will you counter this?" `
`"Ridiculous. `
`That move's so lame, I could yawn. `
`...Beato never used such childish tricks, not even once." `
`"......Battler..." `
`"Repeat it!! `
`"Aunt Eva was also in the room for the entire time before and after the crime"!! `
`Uncle Hideyoshi was just there to create an alibi. `
`You made him stay in the room and stealthily snuck out. `
`...If that isn't true, this guy should be able to say so in red!!!" `
`"I-I refuse to repeat it...! `
`Hideyoshi's evidence is sufficient!! `
`There's no need for me to repeat that, right?!" `
`"...She has refused. `
`You need show no mercy. `
`This is check." `
`"Yeah, I'll take it. This opponent's slow!! `
`Check!! `
`Maybe Uncle Hideyoshi didn't leave the room the whole time. `
`But saying he was taking care of you the whole time...is a bright-red lie!" `
`"Therefore, no alibi exists for you!! `
`You had a chance to slip out of the room and kill Aunt Rosa and Maria! `
`If you think you can dodge that, try proclaiming in red that "Aunt Eva didn't take a step outside of her room"!! `
`You can't, right? `
`Checkmate!!!" `
`"...Wh-What the hell...?! `
`...I-I don't get it...!!" `
`"Sorry, Aunt Eva. `
`...Even if you aren't used to the rules, beating your opponent down with all your strength is how this game is played. `
`...Right, Beato?!" `
`"I-Indeed..." `
`"The witch side resigns. `
`Let us continue on to the next game. `
`Next is the fourth through sixth twilights." `
`It seemed that the witch still didn't understand how to make a winning move, and she lost her composure in irritation. `
`She was probably also angry that a shot had been taken at her while she still didn't get what was going on. `
`...However, I won't go easy on her at all. `
`Just like she didn't go easy on the victims at all, I won't go easy on her...!! `
`"{f:5:Virgilia}, next crime! `
`Let's reconstruct the case with Dad and the rest!!" `
`"Understood. `
`Three people: Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi, went to the mansion and were killed there." `
`"My move won't change. `
`Aunt Eva, you are the culprit!! `
`This time, you don't even have an alibi from Uncle Hideyoshi!! `
`You claim that you were sleeping in that room all by yourself. `
`But that's not true!! `
`If you can proclaim it in red, just try it!!" `
`"...I refuse. `
`...So tell me! `
`Eva is just a woman. `
`And the people who died were three adults with two guns, right? `
`How did she kill them all by herself? `
`How did she do it with those stakes as weapons? `
`Like everyone keeps asking, how is this stake-shooting device constructed?!" `
`"Explain that!! `
`Unless you can explain it, even if Eva doesn't have an alibi, `
`that doesn't mean that it was possible for her to commit the murders!" `
`"Decline explanation!! `
`It's a "Devil's Proof"! `
`Just because I can't explain it, that doesn't deny the existence of an unknown murder technique, or maybe an unknown weapon!!" `
`"In short!! `
`Even if I can't explain how the stake-shooting device is constructed, that doesn't prove that it doesn't exist!!" `
`"Wh-What the hell?!! `
`Does that ridiculousness even count?!" `
`"...Your "Devil's Proof" is valid." `
`"Agreed. `
`It's a valid "Devil's Proof". `
`...Battler-kun can claim that a stake-shooting device exists without bearing the responsibility of explaining how it is constructed. `
`The witch side cannot object to this move." `
`"...N-Not bad... `
`How pushy..." `
`"Heh! `
`Well, there's this ill-natured witch who trained me well. `
`This is check, okay?! `
`Try saying in red that Aunt Eva didn't take a step out of that room!!" `
`"That's right, you shouldn't be able to say it! `
`If you can't say it, it's over, checkmate!!" `
`"...Th-That's so irrational......! `
`This is...messed up...!" `
`"Those are the rules of this game. `
`...How about some black tea first? `
`And some delicious cookies as well." `
`"I don't need all that!! `
`Ah, that pisses me off...! `
`So you fight like a coward just because you can't win with magic...!!" `
`"Don't get irritated. `
`Drink some black tea or something. `
`I'll take mine straight. `
`What about you, Beato?" `
`"I-I am fine... `
`......More importantly, Battler, don't let your guard down. `
`Your opponent is only unfamiliar with the rules. `
`...This will only really start once your opponent gets the gist of it..." `
`"But I'll crush her. `
`I'll thoroughly crush her. `
`Because she isn't a witch." `
`"If I accept her as a witch, ...all your stubbornness will count for nothing! `
`I don't care what kind of irrational argument or twisted logic I have to use, `
`I'll crush her with all my heart and soul!!" `
`Battler's side then stuck with the "Eva Culprit Theory" to explain Krauss and Natsuhi, `
`the seventh and eighth twilights, in the exact same way. `
`At the time, there had been no one on the first floor except for Eva and the victims. `
`...As before, no one could establish an alibi for Eva. `
`Back then, Eva had claimed that they'd disappeared while she went to the bathroom, `
`but there was nothing to support that, and the witch side couldn't repeat it in red either. `
`Using the same style of argument as that question regarding the stake shooting machine, `
`the witch side asked once more how Eva could have strangled both of them at the same time all by herself, `
`but of course, Battler splendidly counterattacked by refusing to explain because of the "Devil's Proof". `
`Under the storm and stress of Battler's spirit, the witch side was completely swallowed up, `
`having to resign three times during the short period of time she had to grasp the rules... `
`"......Kuhhihihihihyahhyahhhya... `
`Hah, I see! `
`I'm finally starting to get the knack of it. `
`I won't let you have things your own way any more! `
`This time, let me take the initiative. `
`Ronove, reconstruct the fourth through the sixth twilights! `
`Pick out Ushiromiya Kyrie! `
`...For now, let me return to the murders of Rudolf, Kyrie and Hideyoshi during the fourth through sixth twilights." `
`"...Wh-What is she thinking? `
`Why would she return once more to a situation where she's lost?" `
`"I see... `
`...This is an unusual attack, and one you do not use. `
`Be careful." `
`"At the time, the survivors were barricaded in the guesthouse. `
`They didn't have food, but out of concern for their safety, they were at least prepared to go without eating until the next day. `
`...However, in the end, three of them went out for food." `
`"......That's right. `
`In the end, three people went outside to get food." `
`"It's a pain, so I'll add in some red and say it. `
`{p:1:Kyrie didn't think that they needed food}. `
`Since going without food for about a day wouldn't kill them, `
`{p:1:she claimed that they should not leave the guesthouse}." `
`And yet, she herself `
`{p:1:suggested that they leave the guesthouse to get food}. `
`......Isn't that a contradiction?" `
`"Yes, a spectacular contradiction. `
`A contradiction exists in Kyrie's pattern of behavior." `
`"That contradiction `
`"was created by me with magic"! `
`In other words, I controlled Kyrie using magic and made her say that to lure the sacrifices outside!!" `
`"R-Ridiculous! `
`There's no way that kind of magic exists!!" `
`"It's a "Devil's Proof", right?! `
`Just because you don't know about that magic doesn't deny its existence! `
`And I don't bear the responsibility of acting out that magic for you. `
`And yet, you have even less room to counter this argument!! `
`......*giggle*giggle*! `
`I wonder if it's alright to fight this way." `
`"Yes. `
`It is truly a spectacular move. `
`...Battler-sama, your response, if you please." `
`"That's a weird strategy she's taking. `
`...So just what is this?" `
`"She has placed a piece attacking Ushiromiya Kyrie's pattern of behavior. `
`...As has already been explained, `
`Kyrie's pattern of behavior had her saying that they should not go outside or head to the mansion in order to get food. `
`And yet, she herself took the initiative, `
`taking the contradictory action of going out to get food. `
`Unless you can explain this contradiction, she will use this violent move to claim that magic was the cause." `
`"...Well, that's probably what Kyrie-san thought in the beginning. `
`But she probably...uh...thought through a few things midway, `
`then changed her mind and decided that food really was necessary... `
`It'd be bad if, when things got tough, we were so hungry that we had no energy, ...and, well..." `
`"...She is claiming that this change of heart was due to magic. `
`In short, ...while it might be extremely difficult, you must explain the reason for Kyrie's change of heart." `
`"...Wh-What are you saying...? `
`...You're talking about the inside of Kyrie-san's head, right...? `
`Can I also summon Kyrie-san's ghost and question her?! `
`Beato! `
`Can't you call Kyrie-san here or something?!" `
`"She cannot. `
`That is a move permitted only to the witch side." `
`"...S-Sorry..." `
`"...Aaaaaaahhh, fuck!! `
`She was probably...umm...thinking of us kids and...umm...on the whole, thought that food was necessary and..." `
`"You must present your claim through objective means. `
`...You'll need concrete proof that Kyrie changed her mind and decided that food really was necessary for some specific reason. `
`...For example, if someone heard her say that, or if it was written down somewhere." `
`"Too bad, `
`{p:1:no reason for her changing her mind was ever told to anyone, nor was one ever written down}! `
`Therefore, you can only speculate as to what was inside Kyrie's mind! `
`So it's impossible to explain!! `
`You don't have a single counter to my move! `
`Isn't it your turn to resign now, Battler-kuuun...?!?!" `
`"...It is possible to hypothesize endlessly as to the reason behind her change of heart. `
`And, it is impossible to crush all of those endless possibilities." `
`"A detestably spectacular move. `
`......If Battler-sama were to have a method of countering, ...it could probably only be that move." `
`"...Wh-What move is that...?" `
`"...Well, `
`I wonder what kind of move it could be. `
`I have the feeling that it was Milady's specialty, but I cannot remember." `
`".........Nnggg... `
`Quit being stingy and tell me...!" `
`"{f:5:Beatrice}, `
`no answers will be given to those who stop thinking for themselves. `
`...Think. `
`Think in your own way!" `
`"Why don't you resign right now? `
`And I'll corner you even more with red. `
`{p:1:Until the last instant before she died, Kyrie's behavior pattern of "not going to get food = not going to the mansion" was maintained}! `
`And yet, she took the initiative and headed towards the mansion. `
`She was pushing a cart, ready to carry food. `
`Why that contradiction?" `
`Because I controlled her with magic!!! `
`This is proof that my magic exists, and that I am a witch!!" `
`"......Shut the hell up...!! `
`A-Are you saying that she never even changed her mind?! `
`...That the whole time until she died, Kyrie-san thought "we don't need food", and "we won't go to the mansion"? `
`Then why did she step forward herself and say that they should go to get food, and go to the mansion...?!!" `
`"Are you saying that Kyrie-san was being controlled with magic?! `
`That's stupid...!! `
`How...how should I break through this magic?!" `
`"...If only Kyrie were here, and just told us the reason behind her change of heart... `
`No, I've already been told in red that she never even changed her mind...! `
`What should I do...?!! `
`There's no move that the human side can counter with!!" `
`"The more I learn about this game, the more advantageous the rules seem for the witch, right? `
`Even if I lose in a lot of areas, if I can win in just one, that alone can display the existence of a witch." `
`"...In other words, Battler-kun has no way of denying witches other than a complete victory! `
`How truly funny that even though you thought you could corner me and call me Eva, `
`it's all been spun around by nothing more than the inside of your respected Kyrie-san's head, right?!" `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ahhahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`Just do it, resign!! `
`If only you'd just accept it! `
`If only you'd just lose!" `
`"......Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiit... `
`It's impossible for a human to prove... `
`I can't do anything but guess at what the dead were thinking when they acted. `
`Furthermore, I can't deny the magic based on conjecture alone. `
`...To break through it, I need objective proof as to why Kyrie-san had a change of heart..." `
`"...But damn it, `
`it's been said in red that no proof exists as to why she changed her mind and wanted food... `
`...What should I do, damn it, damn it...!!!" `
`"......Battler-sama, `
`is this...your resignation?" `
`"............Nggg...! `
`"Not going to get food = not going to the mansion". `
`But then how should I understand Kyrie-san's thoughts, which actually do contradict each other...?!" `
`"You can't understand!! `
`It's impossible to understand, and impossible to interpret!! `
`That darkness is all of the witch! `
`Come on, it's useless to think, so quit, okay?! `
`You just can't deny witches! `
`After all, I exist right here." `
`"I am the Golden Witch!! `
`I stole that name from the former witch over there!! `
`You can't deny that I am {f:5:Beatrice}!!!" `
`"Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit...!!! `
`You have no right to use that name...! `
`...And yet, ...I can't think of a move to deny it......!!!" `
`Battler could no longer counter this witch, who was laughing insanely in triumph... `
`He didn't want to give up, but no move appeared. `
`He ground his teeth, making fists with both hands. `
`...But even so, he couldn't think of a brilliant counterattack...! `
`"Battler-sama, `
`your time limit is over, so will you resign...?" `
`"Kh......aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh......!!!" `
`"......The human side has no move in response. `
`It will resi `
`"Wait! `
`...Th-There is...a counter." `
`"Wh-What did you say...?" `
`"Huh?! `
`What kind of move could possibly exist, Predecessor-sama?! `
`Won't you tell me what kind of move could deny this magic of {f:5:Beatrice}'s? `
`You can't, it's impossible!!" `
`"...If the proposition that "not going to get food = not going to the mansion" cannot be explained by itself, `
`...I will explain it with the contrapositive. `
`In short, you can also explain it with "she still went to the mansion = she had a goal other than food"." `
`"...Th-This is less my specialty, "Hempel's Raven", ...than it is Battler's specialty, "chessboard thinking". `
`...If it was impossible for Kyrie to have gone to the mansion with food as a goal, `
`then we can only explain it by saying she had another reason that got her to go outside despite that. `
`In other words, if we can prove that she had such a goal, we can defeat this magic...!" `
`"I-I see... `
`So, she didn't go to the mansion with food as a goal, but she had a different goal, `
`and she said she wanted to go and get food in order to disguise her real goal..." `
`"...T-True enough, it might be possible to find an explanation that way. `
`...But...how?!" `
`"Teacher, reconstruct the scene of Kyrie's death...! `
`We cannot summon a ghost, but inspecting the corpse ought to be a right allowed to the human side..." `
`"Yes, there is no problem. `
`I shall reconstruct the scene where Ushiromiya Kyrie died. `
`We cannot call Kyrie's ghost here, `
`but by finding out what Kyrie left behind, we may be able to use that as a weapon." `
`"Ha, hahahahahahahahaha!! `
`Fine, search as much as you want!! `
`There's no way you'll learn anything! `
`I just said it in red a short while ago. `
`{p:1:Kyrie did not leave anything written down}! `
`No matter what you find, how could you possibly figure anything out?!!" `
`"......We may find nothing... `
`...But, ...Battler is grinding his teeth, fighting to think of a move to break through you. `
`......This is all that I can do..." `
`{f:5:Beatrice} landed on her feet in the reconstructed hall, `
`approached Kyrie's corpse, and wandered around, observing. `
`"I-I am completely clueless when it comes to fighting on the Human side... `
`......We need to find evidence, right...? `
`...Then what should I search for?" `
`"The Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice} is getting down on her knees and crawling around! `
`And she's even indecently searching a corpse? `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle* That look suits you...!!" `
`"...Say whatever you wish... `
`...I cannot do any more than this... `
`...I care not how I am despised... `
`......However, I cannot throw Battler away, as he is fighting for my honor... `
`...Even if I must crawl on the ground and search through dead flesh, `
`...I must answer to that responsibility..." `
`Bathed in the witch's sneers, Beato searched through Kyrie's corpse. `
`...She fished through the pockets, taking what was inside out and laying it on the floor... `
`Laid on the floor... `
`was a handkerchief, `
`tissue, `
`a key to her house, `
`the stub of a boat ticket, `
`a lighter, `
`a cigarette butt, `
`and a single hundred yen coin... `
`There was no special, suspicious object... `
`Although Beato was down on all fours and being sneered at, that was all she could find. `
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`What's with that seedy looking trash?! `
`How do you think you can break my magic with that stuff?! `
`Worthless, worthless, are you a moron?!! `
`How can you be so lame, and right after you cut in between us, talking so tough?! `
`Aaah, how pathetic, how embarrassing!! `
`If only you'd just give up and die!" `
`The witch fell over laughing, lambasting Beato. `
`...Beato hung her head, trying to withstand this shame. `
`"...Milady, `
`are you finished with your inspection?" `
`"......I-Indeed... `
`...I will not find any more than this..." `
`"Can you make any counter from this evidence? `
`If not, then the human side must resign." `
`"............Nnnnn......" `
`"Obviously, you don't have any room to argue back!! `
`I am a witch. `
`You cannot break through my magic!! `
`You're no longer anything but a former witch. `
`A loser who isn't even allowed to take the name {f:5:Beatrice} anymore!! `
`Come on, pile up as much trash and rubbish as you like, and just try to break my magic!!" `
`"...You can't, right? `
`You can't, can you? `
`Kuhhihihihihi, and why's that? `
`It's because I'm a witch. `
`...It's because you're just a loser without a name!! `
`Kuhhihhyahhyahhyahhyahhyah!!!" `
`"......Something, ......something should be here... `
`......I won't lose heart... `
`...I will not lose heart... `
`No matter how much I am sneered at, ...Battler is fighting for my honor, `
`...so for the sake of his honor, ...I must not lose heart......" `
`As Beato held back tears at the words of humiliation she was being showered with, `
`she tried to find if Kyrie was holding something else, ...to find something that could save Battler from his plight, `
`...searching earnestly. `
`...However, nothing more came up... `
`"......Damn it... `
`...Please, ...Ushiromiya Kyrie... `
`You must save your son from his plight... `
`......Please, ...after death, lend me power for his sake..." `
`However, Kyrie's body did not answer. `
`...It was only natural that a corpse would remain silent. `
`No dead person existed that would answer Beato, who had lost the Endless Magic... `
`"It's pointless, pointless, pointleeess. `
`Toying with the dead is a privilege only for witches. `
`For you, who is neither a witch nor even a Human, no one exists who will lend a hand!!" `
`"You'll be alone for all eternity!! `
`You have no witch or Human allies, and no one will save you!! `
`If that's frustrating, why don't you cry?! `
`If only you'd just apologize, saying "I'm sorry I'm so useless"?! `
`Ahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!" `
`"......Sorry, ...Battler...... `
`...I...couldn't help you...at all..." `
`"............ `
`...No, that's enough. `
`...Thanks, Beato. `
`I won't waste your efforts..." `
`"I-I don't need consoling...! `
`Just how could you possibly argue back with this pile of rubbish...?!! `
`Just how could you possibly strike back with this rubbish I scraped together while she sneered at me...?!" `
`In front of Beato, who was still crawling on all fours and hitting the pile of objects Kyrie had left behind with her fist, Battler also crouched. `
`And, ...after patting her on the shoulder in thanks, `
`...he moved that hand to the ground, picked up the cigarette butt, and held it up over his head. `
`"......What are you trying to say with that trash...?" `
`"Kyrie-san doesn't smoke." `
`But Kyrie also had a lighter on her. `
`True, she didn't have an actual box of cigarettes, `
`but at a glance, it naturally looked as though Kyrie had a smoking habit... `
`"...Dad smoked, but Kyrie didn't. `
`...But she did walk around with just a lighter to light Dad's cigarettes." `
`"Ha! `
`So what? `
`If the husband smoked, then even if the wife didn't, it wouldn't be strange for her to be holding a cigarette. `
`Maybe she just picked up the cigarette butt of her husband, who had bad smoking manners? `
`What are you trying to say? `
`What does this have to do with my magic? `
`Nothing at all!!!" `
`"I'll say more. `
`...This is a different brand of cigarette than what Dad smokes. `
`...Sorry, Beato. `
`Could you look in the pockets of Dad's corpse too?" `
`"......I-Indeed. `
`...You mean this...?" `
`"...Checking the brand. `
`The brand is different from the cigarette butt. `
`...The cigarette butt Kyrie is holding is not of the same brand that Rudolf smokes." `
`"And so what? `
`Maybe Kyrie is just a good girl who likes things to be clean, so she couldn't leave a fallen cigarette butt alone and picked it up? `
`I wouldn't though!!" `
`"...Beato, sorry, but one more time please. `
`...Uncle Hideyoshi's pockets. `
`......In this family, only Dad and Hideyoshi smoke cigarettes." `
`"...I-It's here...! `
`Is this it...? `
`Beato found a cigarette box in Hideyoshi's pocket, took a single one out, and held it up. `
`"...Checking the brand. `
`We acknowledge that the cigarette butt is of the same brand that Hideyoshi smokes." `
`"A-And so what?!! `
`How can you break my magic because you found Hideyoshi's cigarette butt in Kyrie's pocket?!!" `
`"......That's right. `
`This cigarette butt is a message from Kyrie-san. `
`No, ...this cigarette butt itself is the reason that Kyrie-san left the guesthouse. `
`Beato, thank you. `
`...If you hadn't found this, I would've given up here." `
`"......{f:5:Virgilia}!! `
`Reconstruct the situation! `
`The guesthouse after it came to light that Aunt Rosa and Maria had been killed on the second twilight!!" `
`"Understood. `
`Reconstructing now. `
`...After Rosa and Maria's deaths, the remaining survivors rechecked all of the doors and windows in the mansion. `
`They constructed a barricade. `
`They re-confirmed that their defenses were solid." `
`"There's nothing suspicious about that at all. `
`What are you trying to say? `
`Why are you bringing up the second twilight when we're talking about the fourth twilight and after...?!" `
`"Dad carried a portable cigarette butt holder with him. `
`I'm finally starting to see why Kyrie-san went out of her way to put a cigarette butt in her own pocket." `
`"......It was because that cigarette butt meant something. `
`That cigarette butt was itself a message left by Kyrie-san for us...!!" `
`"Th-Then let's hear it!! `
`How do you plan to deny me `
`with that single cigarette butt?!!" `
`"...As we've heard, `
`after the second twilight, an inspection was done of all the rooms in the guesthouse. `
`......At that time, Kyrie-san found something that shouldn't exist, in a place where it shouldn't be." `
`"...S-Something that shouldn't exist...? `
`...What do you mean by that?" `
`"It's this. `
`This cigarette butt. `
`This was set in the ashtray of the guest room that Uncle Hideyoshi was in." `
`"Whaah?!?! `
`What's wrong with there being a cigarette butt in an ashtray?!! `
`Are you sure there isn't something wrong with your head?!" `
`"Aunt Eva hated smoking!! `
`There's no way that there would be a cigarette butt there when she was sick and sleeping!!!" `
`"However, there was a cigarette butt in the ashtray. `
`When she saw that, Kyrie-san noticed immediately. `
`...Uncle Hideyoshi was lying. `
`She realized that Aunt Eva hadn't really been sleeping, `
`...and that she'd snuck out of the room!!" `
`"Repeat it!! `
`"This cigarette butt was crushed out in the ashtray of the room where Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi were resting!"" `
`"......I-I refuse...!" `
`"I've finally got it...... `
`Thank you, Beato." `
`"W‐ `
`Was I... `
`...of some... `
`use...?" `
`"Yeah, you were!! `
`Tear it, we'll tear the mask off of the fake witch!!!" `
`From that cigarette butt, Kyrie realized that Hideyoshi was creating an alibi for Eva's sake. `
`Hideyoshi had been tasked with watching over the room to create an alibi, `
`...and during that time, he was unable to withstand the tension and smoked. `
`Then, Kyrie had confessed that to Rudolf. `
`She confessed that there was a good chance Eva was the culprit, and Hideyoshi was an accomplice. `
`"......Next, Kyrie-san proposed that they go to get food. `
`She then asked Uncle Hideyoshi to lend a hand!! `
`This could only mean one thing." `
`"Kyrie-san planned to isolate Uncle Hideyoshi and question him about the truth!!" `
`"Your "Hempel's Raven" is valid. `
`Unless the witch side counters this move, the existence of the magic that supposedly controlled Kyrie has been denied." `
`"Wh-What did you saaaaaaaaaaaayy?!?! `
`I-I deny it, anyway, I deny it...!! `
`It wasn't me, noooo! `
`It wasn't Ushiromiya Eva, Eva was sleeping in her room!!!" `
`"Then try saying it. `
`Yeah, you can't say it! `
`You can't say it this time either!! `
`"Repetition requested!! `
`"At that time, Ushiromiya Eva did not take a step outside the room"!!" `
`"What the hell is thiiiiiiiis?! `
`I'm the one who was attacking, right?! `
`Why am I the one being attacked now?! `
`When did offense and defense get reversed?! `
`I'm the one questioning you, right?! `
`The witch, me, so whyyyyyyyyyy!!!" `
`"Again!!!! `
`Repeat it!! `
`"Ushiromiya Eva did not leave the room"!! `
`There's no way you can say it, `
`it's checkmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaate!!" `
`"Does the witch side have a move in response?" `
`"...There cannot be one. `
`There is no truth that can be accepted from a false witch dressed up with truths and falsehoods." `
`"You aren't qualified to call yourself a real witch!! `
`You aren't the Golden Witch! `
`You're a human! `
`Ushiromiya Evaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!" `
`"OOOAAAOOOOOOOOOooooOOOOOOoooooohhhhhhhh!!" `
`The witch howled. `
`Her entire body was burned with the tremendous heat that denied her own magic and existence, and she let out a howl like a dragon... `
`Her body flickered repeatedly, `
`flashing as though Eva's figure and the witch's figure overlapped. `
`However, that yell was sucked into the flicker, ...making it return to the original form of the cruel witch. `
`"...*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ...kuhhihhahhahahahaha... `
`...Sure. `
`...If you want to call me Ushiromiya Eva, then go ahead and do that..." `
`"...That's right, I actually can't repulse all moves related to Ushiromiya Eva being the culprit. `
`...I may have been dragged down from the position of Golden Witch, `
`...and you might call me Ushiromiya Eva now... `
`...But you know what? That by itself doesn't mean that witches and magic have been denied!! `
`...I'll teach you starting now... `
`I'll teach you that I am not Ushiromiya Eva, nor a Human, `
`...but a real witch...!!! `
`Take a look at this red truth!!" `
`When the witch clapped her hands, time advanced in the world of the game board. `
`Battler and Eva dashed to the front of the parlor, calling out Jessica's name. `
`...They were searching for Jessica because they had gone to the servant room, found Nanjo's corpse, and didn't know where Jessica was. `
`"......So, what's your point? `
`...What are you trying to say?" `
`"...Y-You couldn't be... `
`...Oh no..." `
`Beato went pale. `
`...In other words, the move the evil witch was about to make was bad enough to make even Beato go pale... `
`"This time, `
`...I'll give you a fatal move that you won't be able to talk yourself out of. `
`...No, I'll make this move against all Humans who support you. `
`Listen carefully to my move." `
`"...St-Stop it, ...that move is......!" `
`"Beato, stay back...!! `
`I'll take it! `
`Come on, you fake witch!!" `
`" `
`{p:1:After Jessica was injured,} `
`{p:1:Eva was constantly under Battler's supervision}. `
`{p:1:Battler is neither the culprit nor an accomplice}. `
`{p:1:By this, we can establish a perfect alibi for Eva}." `
`"...Wh-Whaat......?" `
`"I'll seal you, `
`and Humans as well, `
`...in a red barrier that most certainly cannot be escaped from. `
`Farewell, lowly Humans. `
`Sleep for all eternity in a absolute closed room of magic with no exits. `
`...Come on, listen carefully. `
`Listen to the red truth." `
`{p:1:There are no more than 18 humans on this island}. `
`Throw away your foolish thoughts of mysterious people hiding and committing crimes. `
`...But if I say it that way, you might also suspect animal culprits. `
`I couldn't stand to hear some irrational theory about how an orangutan trained to commit murder wouldn't count as a human. `
`So, I'll change it like this. `
`{p:1:No life forms other than humans have any connection to this game}. `
`That's how it is. `
`Next, I'll explain the situation of all 18 people who exist on this island. `
`{p:1:Kinzo is dead}. `
`{p:1:Krauss is dead}. `
`{p:1:Natsuhi is dead}. `
`{p:1:Hideyoshi is dead}. `
`{p:1:George is dead}. `
`{p:1:Rudolf is dead}. `
`{p:1:Kyrie is dead}. `
`{p:1:Rosa is dead}. `
`{p:1:Maria is dead}. `
`{p:1:Genji is dead}. `
`{p:1:Shannon is dead}. `
`{p:1:Kanon is dead}. `
`{p:1:Gohda is dead}. `
`{p:1:Kumasawa is dead}. `
`{p:1:Nanjo is dead}. `
`Those 15 are all dead. `
`And. `
`{p:1:Battler is alive}. `
`{p:1:Eva is alive}. `
`{p:1:Jessica is alive}. `
`That's everyone, all 18 of them! `
`"Which means that when the last victim, Nanjo, died, `
`only three people, Battler, Eva, and Jessica, were alive, right?" `
`"......Wh-What did you say...? `
`...D-Dammit, ...you don't mean......" `
`" `
`{p:1:Eva was with you the whole time}. `
`{p:1:So committing a crime was impossible for her}. `
`{p:1:Of course, Battler‐kun isn't the culprit}. `
`{p:1:He wasn't forging an alibi for her, and he took the possibility that she was the culprit into account, watching over her actions carefully}." `
`" `
`{p:1:No chance existed for her to do anything suspicious}! `
`{p:1:In short, at the time of the crime, only Nanjo and Jessica were in the servant room}." `
`"...And I know what you're thinking. `
`Your next move will be this, right? `
`There's also a chance that Jessica is the culprit! `
`But too bad, I'll slice it up in red before you try!!" `
`" `
`{p:1:Ushiromiya Jessica has not committed murder}! `
`{p:1:She was not involved with Nanjo's murder}!! `
`{p:1:Her eyes were completely blocked}. `
`{p:1:It's impossible for her to carry out a murder like that}!" `
`And here's a bonus. `
`{p:1:Neither Eva nor Battler killed Nanjo, nor were they involved}!!" `
`"W-Wait a second!! `
`That doesn't make sense!! `
`There were only three humans, then a murder occurs, ...and none of those three were involved?! That's insane!!" `
`"I'll state it clearly. `
`{p:1:The culprit who killed Nanjo was neither Battler nor Eva nor Jessica}!! `
`In other words, it wasn't one of the survivors. `
`Get iiit?" `
`"No, umm, ......th-that's right! `
`What about multiple personalities...?! `
`Just like how you were originally another personality of Aunt Eva's, `
`...let's say Jessica had another, witch-like personality, `
`which took the name of "someone other than Jessica" and killed Doctor Nanjo...!!" `
`"Moron. `
`I've already said it in red. `
`{p:1:Jessica's eyes were completely blocked, and murder was impossible for her}!" `
`No matter what kind of personality she was possessed by, murder could not be carried out with her body! `
`I wonder if you'll be satisfied if I say it this way? `
`"{p:1:No actions caused by Jessica's body had any relation to or influence on the murder of Nanjo}! `
`{p:1:This also applies to Battler and Eva}. `
`In other words, no matter how much you try to struggle and interpret it, `
`{p:1:neither Jessica nor Battler nor Eva is the culprit who killed Nanjo}!" `
`"Y-You've got to be kidding me!!! `
`I mean, everyone else is definitely dead, right?!! `
`Then...all that's left...is the "Doctor Nanjo Suicide Theory", right?! `
`And the trap theory! `
`The culprit was already dead, but a trap that they had already prepared went off..." `
`"{p:1:Nanjo's death was a homicide}. `
`...{p:1:Of course, it was with a direct method of murder, not a trap}. `
`{p:1:They readied their weapon, and killed him with it directly from the front at point‐blank range}! `
`{p:1:The culprit appeared openly before Nanjo's eyes, and as they both looked at each other's faces, the culprit killed him}...!!" `
`"But wait!! `
`There are only three survivors! `
`You said in red that everyone else is dead! `
`You basically confirmed the life or death status of all 18 people. `
`Furthermore, the existence of a 19th person has already been denied in red...!!" `
`"In other words, no one can exist except the three survivors!! `
`And yet, a fourth person other than those three appeared before Doctor Nanjo!! `
`How could a person other than us appear and murder Doctor Nanjo when no 19th person exists?!?! `
`Insane!! `
`You're lying!! `
`You're lying with the red!!!" `
`"{p:1:The red only tells the truth}!!! `
`Isn't doubting that the same as betraying the honor of that witch who's behind you, shriveling up in fear of me and hiding behind your back?!" `
`"D-Damn it......!!!" `
`"Right now, `
`I'll state it clearly. `
`...The one who appeared in front of Nanjo was me. `
`A witch. `
`...The Golden Witch, who can't be explained away with the 18 humans!!" `
`"{f:5:V-Virgilia}! `
`Ronove...!! `
`Isn't there a contradiction in this situation?! `
`Is she really telling the truth with red?!" `
`"...Yes. `
`Her "red truth" is valid." `
`"......What an...elaborate and precise cornering..." `
`"H-How should I make a move against her...? `
`{f:5:Virgilia}...! `
`Aren't there any moves...?!" `
`".........I...cannot think of anything..." `
`"...And you, Ronove?!" `
`"............ `
`......My apologies. `
`...However, in these last thousand years, `
`...I have never seen...such an elaborately beautiful game board layout." `
`"............Although it pains me to admit it, `
`......but it's beautiful...... `
`...What a... `
`beautiful... `
`checkmate made in red......" `
`The witch's teacher and the demon butler were both stunned, ...and an expression of ecstasy rose to their faces... `
`......Forget surrendering, `
`...they were impressed at this perfect checkmate, `
`...which simply had to be admired... `
`When people accept defeat from the bottom of their hearts... `
`...It gives rise to neither regrets nor humiliation. `
`...Nothing is born except feelings of respect... `
`I......no longer knew...what was what anymore. `
`There were absolutely no weak points in her red. `
`She had said in red that all of 15 people had died. `
`She had said in red that no people existed other than the 18. `
`In other words, no more than three people: me, Jessica, and Aunt Eva, existed. `
`And even though none of those three people were the culprit, Doctor Nanjo was killed. `
`And without a doubt, Doctor Nanjo's death was a homicide, he was murdered by "that person" openly from in front of him...! `
`And she's saying that "that person"...is a witch......?!! `
`"The culprit that killed Nanjo was not an animal or anything of the sort. `
`That has already been dealt with in red, you know? `
`Remove everything other than humans from consideration entirely. `
`And no stuff like robots, either." `
`"{p:1:Absolutely no factors other than humans participate in this game board}! `
`Therefore, I can also say this. `
`"{p:1:The one who killed Nanjo was definitely a human}!" `
`"{p:1:A human, with their feet on the ground, held up a weapon and killed with it}! `
`{p:1:Right before his eyes}! `
`However, the human may have been able to use magic. `
`...In other words, it was a witch." `
`"...In other words, it was me. `
`The Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!" `
`......Even as Battler... `
`ground his teeth, `
`...his knees hit the floor with a thunk. `
`His soul still refused to surrender... `
`...However, ...his knees had already... `
`started to accept surrender... `
`"Kuhhihhihihihihihihihihi! `
`Oh, did you kneel...? `
`That's right, you're already starting to understand. `
`...The Golden Witch does exist. `
`......And that Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, is me...!!" `
`"Come on, praise me. `
`Now, praise the resurrection of a true witch. `
`Now, praise the resurrection of the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!! `
`On the ninth twilight, the witch shall revive, and none shall be left alive...!!!" `
`"Daaamn iiiiiiiitt...... `
`...I don't...understand...! `
`After...being so thoroughly immobilized by the red, `
`...I don't...have a clue anymore...!" `
`"...B-Battler... `
`D-Don't lose heart... `
`...You and I...promised that we would fight each other again, right...? `
`Will you surrender here...?! `
`Will you disappear in a place like this before fighting with me again...?!" `
`"I don't want to break that promise... `
`......However, ...I can't think of any move to deny her...!! `
`In the first place, ...this isn't even a puzzle! `
`Nothing exists outside the suspects, and all of the suspects are innocent! `
`I was told that they were innocent in red, right?! `
`And also that it was a real homicide, and that the culprit was human, and that they did appear before Doctor Nanjo's eyes and kill him! `
`I give up, ...there's nothing I can do...!!!" `
`"Please, Battler, don't give up, don't lose heart...! `
`...If you stop thinking, it automatically becomes your loss. `
`...I'm begging you, don't lose heart... `
`...I'm also cheering you on, ...so don't lose...!" `
`"I can't think of anything anymore...!! `
`I find myself thinking she's gotta be a witch, who must've done it with magic, which makes all thinking pointless...! `
`It's useless, my head hurts, my brain's tired... `
`I'm starting to think that thinking's pointless, so I should just stop...!!" `
`"Battler, listen... `
`......In the game of chess, both sides do all they can to make the other lose, so a single game takes a long period of time. `
`...However, if one side throws away victory from the beginning and makes moves harmful to themselves, the game can end in the blink of an eye. `
`...That is called a fool's mate." `
`A fool's mate is, simply put, a strange way of playing chess, in which the fastest methods of losing are considered. `
`...Opening the area in front of your own king and inviting the opponent's queen in. `
`Even though the average game time in chess is several hours, a game can be resolved in a scant four moves. `
`...In other words, if both sides try to win in a fight, they are compelled to take a painfully long period of time, `
`...but if one side decides to lose, the game can be ended far too easily, at any time... `
`"...When the human side stops thinking, it hands the problem before its eyes over to the witch, `
`and even an apple falling from a tree can be immediately resolved as the work of magic." `
`"......It is the same for the witch's side. `
`...Witches use the red truth. `
`...By using that, they can explain the true form of magic with humans...and immediately lose." `
`"......You don't have to tell me that... `
`...You're telling me to not stop thinking, right...? `
`However, `
`......how should I counterattack that person's perfect bright-red move...? `
`For me, `
`...for humans, `
`......it's no longer possible......" `
`".........Is it... `
`...impossible...? `
`...Is it really... `
`...impossible for you, Battler...? `
`...Please, ...don't lose heart......" `
`".........Sorry...... `
`...I've... `
`...reached my limit......" `
`Battler scratched at the floor, crying heavily. `
`...Beato watched that with a distressed face... `
`Then she stood up and spoke to the witch. `
`"......I will make a move as a counter to yours." `
`"Huh? `
`I wonder just how you plan to cut up this perfect checkmate. `
`How can this checkmate, one totally impossible for Humans to break, `
`be defeated by the likes of you?!" `
`"......B-{f:5:Beatrice}, you don't mean to..." `
`"Indeed. `
`...If a Human cannot make a move, `
`...I will assault you with a move I can use precisely because I am a witch..." `
`"A move you can use because you're a witch...? `
`...Wh-What are you planning to do...?" `
`"I will use the red... `
`to deny witches." `
`"{f:5:Beatrice}...!!" `
`"M‐Milady...!!" `
`The teacher and the butler were both startled. `
`...I also immediately understood what it meant. `
`To use the red that only witches could use. `
`{i:To use the red to deny witches}. `
`It was like using her own sword to slit her own throat. `
`"......Wh-Whaaat...?! `
`...H-Hey, what are you saying? `
`Deny witches with red...? `
`......Q-Quit talking like an idiot. `
`If you do that, ...you won't get away unscathed either...!!" `
`"......You are not a witch. `
`And I am not a witch either. `
`...The road to becoming a true witch is difficult, and I have much, much farther to go..." `
`"......Very well then. `
`Right here, right now, there have never been any witches in the first place. `
`I will strip this deception away myself." `
`"Aren't both of us real, obvious witches?!! `
`Being able to use red is itself proof of witches! `
`I don't know what the definition of a witch is to you, `
`but if you think that you alone will be able to get away unscathed, then-" `
`"How could I make such a mistake? `
`I care not." `
`"Wh......What did you say...?" `
`"I never did manage to become a witch. `
`...I've done nothing more than finally begin walking down the road to becoming a true witch. `
`...If what I am right now is a witch, `
`...then I'm a false witch like you, one who is merely drunk on power." `
`"...Rather than existing in that shabby form, `
`I shall erase this form of mine along with you, `
`without any regrets...!" `
`"...A-Are you insane?!?! `
`S-Stop it...! `
`I still wanna be a witch! I hate being Human...!!" `
`"......Witch-sama, please return to your seat. `
`Please, receive the human side's counter from your seat." `
`"Wh-What are you doing?! `
`L-Let go of me!! `
`Don't let that woman use red!! `
`Make her stop!! `
`Let gooooooooooooooooooo!!" `
`As the witch stood from her seat and tried to spring upon Beato, Ronove pressed down on both of her shoulders, forcing her back into her seat. `
`And, even after that, he didn't remove his hands from those shoulders. `
`Denying witches was the same thing as denying magic. `
`...That included demons such as Ronove. `
`However, instead of running away, Ronove chose to act as the facilitator for the game, `
`...and to carry out that duty for his master's sake. `
`"...{f:5:Beatrice}, `
`......you have...no regrets, right...?" `
`"That's my line. `
`...Sorry, Teacher. `
`...Even though you taught me so much about fun magic and magic that brings happiness, `
`......I wasn't able to use it well at all. `
`......So I'll study from square one... `
`and start over again. `
`...I am truly sorry......that you had to suffer for your stupid disciple's misconduct." `
`"...I had a good disciple in the very end. `
`...Go, do what you believe in." `
`"......I-I don't have a clue what you guys are talking about... `
`...But I do understand one thing. `
`And I can say this... `
`...Beato, I don't know what you're trying to do, `
`...but stop trying to do it...!" `
`"You have no moves. `
`But I have one. `
`...If we let that move get away, she will be revived as a witch in the truest sense, and this time, she will control this whole island. `
`...All nightmares will be hers to do with as she pleases, `
`and this island will fall into the deepest hell of the evil witch's repeating delusions, for all eternity." `
`"......Can you permit that? `
`...Don't you care if your dear relatives are toyed with for all eternity in that witch's nightmare?" `
`"S-Still, ...you shouldn't have to sacrifice yourself... `
`Th-This is a game between me and her. `
`You shouldn't have to make your move and sacrifice yourself! `
`I-I'll think of something! `
`I'll surely think of a miraculous move...!!" `
`"So don't rush into it!! `
`Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhh, damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit, `
`I'll definitely think of one, ...so don't rush into iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!" `
`"......This game is cruel. `
`The time limit for your consideration has already run out. `
`......I am now the only one who can do it. `
`...Calm yourself, Battler. `
`......I'll defeat her. `
`...I'll defeat that cruel witch with my own hands..." `
`"W-Wait, Beato!! `
`Stop it, quit it!! `
`There's absolutely no need for you to sacrifice yourself!!" `
`"Weren't you fighting to deny me? `
`...What a strange person. `
`Hahahahahahahaha." `
`"...Let that child do as she likes. `
`And please, watch her until the end." `
`"...B-But..." `
`"Battler, `
`...there's only one thing I ask. `
`...Would you...cover your ears?" `
`"My ears...? `
`Why...?" `
`"......Starting now, I will deny witches in red. `
`I will slice up the game board that she has laid out with her red. `
`...By doing that, `
`......I will probably lose my form as a witch as well. `
`...If you also hear the red truth I speak, you will understand my true form." `
`"......If you alone cover your ears, that truth will not change at all. `
`...However, `
`...even so, I want you alone to cover your ears. `
`.........I at least want to be a witch...in your eyes. `
`...Please." `
`"...{f:5:Beatrice}-sama, `
`...there are no problems on the witch side. `
`Please, your move." `
`"Let gooooooooooooooooooo!! `
`You won't get away unharmed either, you know?!" `
`She's insane!! `
`Do you plan on dying and taking us with you?! `
`Stop it, don't deny it!! `
`Stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!!" `
`"...How unsightly for a Golden Witch. `
`......Okay, are you ready? `
`...I will remove your check in Battler's stead. `
`What happened on the chessboard where 15 died and only three remained? `
`...Starting now, I will expose it in red. `
`With that red truth, ...I will pierce and kill both fake witches!" `
`Beato turned around and smiled at Battler. `
`...Most likely, no one would believe that the witch who had gone to the limits of cruelty... `
`would try to leave a smile as the last expression she showed Battler. `
`And that smile signified her last wish, that she wanted him to cover his ears... `
`Denying witches in red...was the same as knowing her shabby form. `
`Battler put both of his hands against his ears... `
`...To protect her final... `
`bit of honor as a witch, he put his hands against his ears, ...rejecting the truth. `
`And he howled. `
`So that not even a bit of what she was saying would slip into his ears. `
`After that...was a world where Battler could hear nothing. `
`Beato was saying something in red. `
`Even the evil witch covered her ears at those bitter contents. `
`...That was...the red truth. `
`Words of power. `
`...Words that denied her own existence. `
`Unique words that only witches could use, which denied witches. `
`Beato spoke. `
`With the red truth, she cut up the bright-red game board that the witch had released. `
`She explained difficult problems that could not be solved by humans, with moves that could only be solved by witches, and began cornering the witch. `
`The "truth" that Battler was not permitted to hear. `
`If Battler had broken his promise and sneakily eavesdropped... `
`...In an instant, Battler would probably have been able to become the victor in his game with Beato. `
`...He would probably have understood all the riddles on the island, all of the magic and tricks, closed rooms, spells, curses, legends, `
`...and this entire tale of anger and sadness. `
`However, ...Battler would only learn what that was when he reached the truth by himself. `
`Yes. `
`...From the beginning, ...{f:5:Beatrice} had wished that Battler would reach that truth by himself. `
`It was something one shouldn't reach by being told it. `
`It was a truth that Battler would have to drag himself to by his own power. `
`A brilliant light gathered with Beato and the evil witch at the center...and grew gradually stronger... `
`It was...the power of truth. `
`......Its heat and brilliance like the sun... `
`shone on all the falsehoods that hid in the darkness, trying to deceive, ...and burnt them to nothing. `
`"Gwoooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!! `
`Why?! `
`Why can you die?! `
`Why can you throw away your life...when you have such incredible power?! `
`You who hold the power to control gold, magic, and everything at will, `
`why can you so readily throw that away?!" `
`"...Learn that even with a mountain of gold, `
`even with magic to split the sea, `
`there are some things you can never obtain. `
`......Come, show yourself. `
`Show your true form, ...Ushiromiya Eva!!!" `
`When the sun exploded and blew everything away... `
`...Eva could be seen there, holding a gun. `
`"...Y-You're the culprit, `
`Aunt Eva...!!!" `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle* ...Ahhahahahahahahahaha!! `
`Took you long enough to notice, Battler-kuun!!" `
`Without any hesitation or mercy, Eva raised her gun and pulled the trigger. `
`...As an explosive sound rang out, Battler's heart was shot through, and he fell to the floor. `
`After going into convulsions for a short time, `
`...with blood dripping from his mouth, `
`...Battler died... `
`But in his last moments, he realized without a doubt that she was a murderer. `
`And not just for killing him... `
`......There have been many murders, and I don't have a clue how they were carried out. `
`However, ...while my ears were covered, `
`...Beato exposed all of them with the red, blasting away all magic. `
`...In other words, ......even though I didn't understand it, `
`...was that nothing more or less than proof that magic can all be explained with humans? `
`......Beato made me cover my ears. `
`...So I myself don't know the whole truth. `
`...However, ......now that it's been denied in red, `
`I can see one fact which is extremely unfair for us, ...that "It is possible to deny all magic". `
`So, in other words, ......... `
`...No, `
`...I must not think of that. `
`......If I do, ...then the time I spent covered my ears would be made pointless. `
`If I'm going to regret, I can only regret my own actions. `
`...If, at that time, I'd thought of some move to spin things around and counter the witch's final move, `
`there would have been no need for Beato to sacrifice herself. `
`It was...my own worthlessness...that brought about this conclusion... `
