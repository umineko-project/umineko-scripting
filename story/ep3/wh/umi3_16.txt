`The guesthouse lobby was wrapped in silence. `
`The strings of tension binding Krauss, Natsuhi, and Eva had already loosened, and they were completely worn out, with their minds beginning to waver. `
`Every once in a while, they would stand up and walk around pointlessly, as though fighting their drowsiness. `
`"......Are you okay, Eva-san? `
`...Please, do take it easy and rest." `
`"I told you, I'm fine... `
`...The three of us are now the only adults... `
`There's no time to rest... `
`No matter what the cost, we must guard this place until the end... `
`...Haah, ...haah..." `
`She spoke bravely, but she couldn't hide her rough breathing. `
`...It seemed that the fever, which had been calmed with medicine for a short time, had returned. `
`It was very obvious that Eva's health was not good. `
`"Take it easy. `
`At least close your eyes. `
`If something happens that you need to be awake for, we will definitiely wake you." `
`"I'm telling you I'm fine...! `
`Leave me alone...!!" `
`"............" `
`It seemed she was already unwilling to budge. `
`...Krauss and Natsuhi realized that even if they talked to her any more when she was like this, it wouldn't reach her ears. `
`So without saying anything more, they decided to let her be. `
`To Eva right now, even having an argument like that would be burdensome. `
`It would probably be better for her body if she just sat there with her mouth closed. `
`In truth, Eva was just a step away from being beaten down by drowsiness. `
`...Perhaps she shot back at them with a temper because she was trying to rouse herself and throw off her sleepiness. `
`The clock would be pointing to 6:00 in the afternoon very soon. `
`She'd had several snacks to distract herself from her drowsiness, so she didn't feel hungry, `
`but now her lack of sleep made it feel like it was 6:00 in the morning, not the afternoon. `
`...Even supposing that the boat came at precisely 9:00 in the morning tomorrow, `
`...they still had more than 12 full hours to go. `
`...It was an overwhelmingly long stretch of time. `
`......Long. `
`......Painful... `
`...Hot... `
`Even the sound of the clock torments my body now. `
`In times like this, ...when that person puts his hand on my forehead, the fever fades at once. `
`...But that person no longer exists...... `
`As Eva's mind grew foggy, she was once again gripped by a deep sadness... `
`She had already cried herself dry. `
`Even so, the sadness of losing her beloved husband had not been exhausted... `
`"......I... `
`...was wrong..." `
`"...What do you mean?" `
`The new witch and Eva were fundamentally the same being. `
`...If Eva talked to her, she would always respond... `
`"...I thought that if I could gain the position of the Ushiromiya Family Head, ...that alone would be enough. `
`...But then, as soon as I saw that mountain of gold, my greed grew. `
`......I was struck by a desire to have that mountain all to myself..." `
`"That's nothing to be ashamed of. `
`After all, it's your natural right as the Ushiromiya Family Head. `
`How could you give up even a bit of it to anyone else?" `
`"......I was gripped by that temptation, ...which is why you were born. `
`...While you are a young girl version of me, `
`...at the same time, you are also my self-centered evil heart. `
`...Because of my foolish greed sprouted by that mountain of gold, `
`...the shell of the egg that is my heart cracked, ...and you were born into this world... `
`......I am responsible for your birth...!" `
`"In that case, when I killed Rosa and Maria, `
`and then Rudolf, Kyrie and Hideyoshi, you were responsible for that too." `
`"Why did you kill my husband too...?! `
`Why...?!! `
`Aaaaaaaagggghhhhh!!" `
`"...I didn't want to kill Hideyoshi. `
`He was just so annoying and persistent. `
`...And that's our...no, your fault. `
`It's your fault for choosing a husband like that." `
`"A child like you cannot understand what made that man so wonderful!! `
`Oooooooooooooooohhhh, ...dear, ...aaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!" `
`"......What the heck? `
`Our dreams were made real with magic, right? `
`We solved the riddle of the epitaph. `
`Then we found the gold and got the Head's Ring. `
`All of our dreams came fully true, right? `
`What more could you want...?" `
`"Those weren't all of my dreams...!! `
`What about living a wonderful life with that person and giving George an excellent life...?! `
`I still have many dreams that haven't come true...as a wife, as a mother...!! `
`And yet, ...and yet...!" `
`"...Those are just extra dreams you added after becoming an adult. `
`They aren't my dreams." `
`"That's because you're a child...!! `
`Do you only care about what's best for yourself?! `
`...That's right, everything is my fault...!! `
`Back then, why did I resist doing what Rosa told me to? `
`Why couldn't I announce to all of the siblings that I'd found the gold...? `
`...It's all because I'm so hideous!! `
`My evil heart, which sprouted from my desire to have all that gold for myself, ...caused you to hatch!!" `
`"......Looks like you really hate me. `
`Even though we're both Ushiromiya Eva." `
`"No, that isn't true anymore. `
`And it was you who said it. `
`I am Ushiromiya Eva. `
`And you are the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}...!! `
`So just disappear! `
`Witches are imaginary, illusions that only exist in fairy tales...!! `
`Things like you should just disappear! `
`Never appear in front of me again!!" `
`"...Yeah, ...you're right. `
`...I understand. `
`I'll disappear from in front of you. `
`...And I am no longer Ushiromiya Eva. `
`From now on, I'm the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`...So now I can play however I want." `
`"I don't even care about you. `
`If only you'd just give up and die!" `
`After having a very childlike tantrum, the witch who had once been another Eva vanished. `
`...Only Eva was left behind in the darkness. `
`And she questioned herself... `
`"Me...? `
`I...killed them...? `
`Did I kill...that person...? `
`...Did I...kill...him......?" `
`She could no longer answer that question herself... `
`"...g... *cough*cough*cough*!! `
`*cough*cough*cough*!!" `
`It seemed that, half-asleep, she had gotten some saliva caught in her windpipe just as she was dozing off. `
`...Eva suddenly started coughing. `
`"Are you okay, Eva? `
`...Please Natsuhi, some water." `
`"Y-Yes..." `
`"I-I'm fine, okay...? `
`*cough*cough*cough*! `
`*co-ugh*cough*!! `
`I just...choked a bit...! `
`*cough*cough*cough*!" `
`Eva pushed away Natsuhi's hand as she tried to rub her back...and unsteadily rose to her feet. `
`"......I'm going to go wash my face. `
`...Sorry, I fell asleep. `
`...When I get back, I'll make some more coffee. `
`......Extra strong, so that I won't get drowsy until tomorrow morning." `
`"Yes, please do. `
`...Your coffee's more to my tastes than what Gohda makes." `
`"I'm glad to hear it, even if it's flattery... `
`*cough*cough*! `
`.........I'll be back soon." `
`Eva exited the lobby, heading for the bathroom. `
`Krauss and Natsuhi watched over her frail back... `
`"...So, you sometimes do show concern for Eva-san, even though you've always been so much at odds with her." `
`"......... `
`...Isn't this how an older brother is supposed to be...?" `
`"...Yes. `
`I believe you're right." `
`"It isn't just Eva. `
`...There's Rudolf and Rosa too. `
`...Instead of acting like an older brother to them, all I ever did was speak arrogantly and bully them." `
`"......In my own way, I was frantic in my desire to be like Father. `
`...But I could never match up, and I always vented my feelings on them... `
`But that is no excuse. `
`...I probably gave Eva scars so deep that they still have not healed. `
`...I regret it, but even if I apologized after all this time, it would do nothing to heal those wounds..." `
`"......If you can hold onto that feeling, instead of only letting it last for this moment, `
`...I'm sure your siblings will come to see it sooner or later." `
`"...Though, by now, Eva is the only sibling I have left." `
`"......If only...you and your siblings hadn't been born into the Ushiromiya family, `
`...you might have had a more normal, a more fun sibling relationship..." `
`"...You mustn't say that... `
`......Eva will probably continue to hate me for her whole life. `
`And she has a right to. `
`...I...intend to resign myself to that fact and accept it." `
`".........Dear..." `
`"...Eva, `
`......I'm sorry. `
`...Of course, you don't have to forgive me..." `
`Of course I won't forgive you. What are you talking about, after all this time? `
`"Oh, so now you're feeling guilty? If only you'd just give up and die right now! `
`Do it, Chiester Sisters!!" `
`"45, Firing Permission Received. `

`Data Link to 410." `
`"410, Data Received, Firing Permission Confirmed. `
`Nihihihihi, Firing!" `
`Together, the sisters released the magical bowstring they had readied. `
`A beautiful tail trailed behind the gold arrow, and it drew a lovely curve as it flew. `
`It was just like a gold snake. `
`It skillfully avoided a grove of trees and flew towards the front door of the guesthouse. `
`Then it flew into the keyhole of the door and snuck into the guesthouse without any problem at all. `
`The gold snake raced down the hall smoothly, yet as fast as an arrow. `
`Right before it was the door to the lobby. `
`When it flew into the key hole, Krauss and Natsuhi were already... `
`For an instant, Krauss thought he saw a gold-colored sparkle in the keyhole on the door. `
`However, at the same time as he strained his eyes to see what it was, that sparkle bent like a whip and attacked, `
`wrapping itself around Krauss's neck. `
`"......Ack, ......ah, nn-" `
`Just looking at it, the gold snake seemed very supple. `
`However, it was as though a wire had tightened around Krauss's neck. `
`And while that snake choked Krauss, it extended even more, and also tightened around Natsuhi's neck. `
`Without even a chance to scream, their eyes bulged as they went into convulsions and then collapsed. `
`"45, Hit and Kill Confirmed. `
`Formulating Towing Curve, Revising Capture Points. `
`Data Link to 410." `
`"410, Data Received. `
`Initiating Corpse Towing. `
`We got both of 'em nyeh, nihi!" `
`The gold snake began to drag Krauss and Natsuhi's bodies back. `
`...They slipped through the door to the corridor, dragging the bodies, gradually increasing in speed, `
`and rapidly pulled them outside the guesthouse. `
`So, the lobby was silent, as though nothing had happened. `
`...As though Krauss and Natsuhi had not been there since the beginning. `
`Only the sound of the wind and the rain remained, as if they were playing dumb and pretending to be the only ones there... `
`"...Sorry, I'm fine now. `
`...I'll go make some coffee." `
`Eva returned from the bathroom. `
`But no one was in the lobby. `
`Even though they had supposedly been in that sofa until the moment she had choked and gone to the bathroom, `
`they were gone, as if they'd been an illusion from the very beginning. `
`"...How careless of them... `
`...Where did those two go off to together?" `
`Eva put her hand on the sofa as though acting out a scene from a detective novel. `
`...She felt a warmth that meant that they'd been sitting there until a short while ago. `
`Maybe they went to do the rounds or something. `
`For the time being, Eva sat down and waited for their return... `
`Beato and George could be seen in the parlor of the mansion. `
`George was kneeling near Shannon's body as though praying... `
`His face was serious, and there was even sweat on his forehead. `
`However, Beato was the same. `
`Now that she had handed her name over, most of her previous power had been lost. `
`...Of course, she still had more than enough power to be called a witch, but compared to the past, it was a very faint thing. `
`"...Good. `
`Don't talk to her, don't touch her with your hand. `
`...Call to her with the voice of your heart, and seek her with the hand of your heart. `
`...Only your strong feelings can make my magic reach Shannon's lost soul." `
`"............!" `
`George kept praying earnestly and silently. `
`He kept frantically yelling inside his heart, trying to call back the soul of the person he loved. `
`...He strongly envisioned his soul leaving his body...and searching for her as she wandered through the Land of the Dead. `
`...Beato turned that strong force into magical power that supplemented her own magic. `
`This was magic that, in the past, she could have performed easily, without anyone's help. `
`...But now, if she didn't rely on someone's assistance, she wouldn't be able to finish the chant, much less succeed. `
`"......I'd forgotten for several centuries... `
`......Was magic... `
`was resurrection... `
`always this difficult...?" `
`Beato was wearing an even more strained expression than George. `
`...It had slipped her mind, but originally, the magic to revive a life was the ultimate hidden art. `
`The abnormal thing was her previous magical power, which could be used over and over with a snap of her fingers. `
`So, the heavy burden on her body and mind was, fundamentally speaking, extremely natural... `
`"...However, ......this man's power... `
`...Even though he doesn't know magic, it's nothing to be laughed at. `
`...I see, so he truly is Kinzo's grandchild..." `
`The strong energy pouring from George was large enough to act as magical power. `
`...At first, Beato thought it must be the blood of Kinzo, the sorceror. `
`...However, that probably wasn't it. `
`...She had a feeling that Battler had already told her what it was. `
`It had been born from the power of George's sadness at the death of the person he loved, ...and from the way he had tried his hardest throughout his life, `
`from the warm time spent together with Shannon, to the size of the dream they swore to protect in the future. `
`Is it really possible for humans to take life so seriously, even though they only have a single one? `
`...It was only natural. `
`To her, a life didn't mean anything more than the difference between the top and bottom of an Othello piece. `
`If the black represented death, then she thought all you had to do was flip it over again and make it white. `
`However, it was just like that broken vase. `
`...To humans in a world without magic, where they cannot return things to their original form, `
`...it is very, very natural for them to bet their life and soul. `
`"......So, is an Endless Witch, who can do as she pleases even with life and death... `
`inferior to a limited Human who can't even surpass the mountain of death...?" `
`This time, the witch acknowledged it. `
`He was able to hold a magical power that could never reside in witches who didn't understand the value of a life. `
`...Why does this thing called the Endless Magic exist? `
`...Even though I called myself the Endless Witch, `
`did I forget what the Endless Magic means for a thousand years......? `
`She looked at George's expression again. `
`......His surging earnestness was like a lightning bolt. `
`...Right now, even if George's body had been burned or smashed by a waterfall, `
`he would probably continue to pray for his beloved without minding it, without noticing it. `
`For the first time, ...she showed respect for that power. `
`So in that instant, all magical resistance was lost, and the enormous power of George's feelings turned into magical energy in its complete form... `
`The vase was very beautiful, rich with history and value. `
`Even as young as I was, it still forced me to take a deep breath when I witnessed its beauty. `
`...But that just made me want to touch it. `
`But the vase easily fell and smashed into pieces. `
`...Like a bubble that had popped, `
`it felt as though the time it possessed a form had been just an illusion. `
`Lives are just that fragile, just that easily...lost. `
`I realized that my foolish curiosity had led to something that couldn't be undone. `
`No matter how much I regretted it, no matter how much I apologized. `
`The smashed vase wouldn't return back to its original form... `
`A lost life will not return to normal no matter what happens. `
`I was frightened that, even though my actions had been thoughtless and careless, `
`...they had stolen away a life that could never be revived again. `
`Then, I pitied that lost life and cried. `
`I was frightened of myself, the one responsible for its loss, and cried even more. `
`I'm sure Grandfather will also cry at the loss of his precious vase. `
`I'm sure that all the people who love Grandfather and see him like that will cry. `
`With the loss of a single life, the whole world can be filled with so much sadness. `
`...I cried even more at how terrible that was. `
`{f:5:Beatrice} appeared...and spoke. `
`"Then, Milady, `
`let us revive that vase with magic. `
`If that will make everyone happy, the vase and the magic and the spirits... `
`will happily lend you their power and return it to its original form. `
`Come, Milady. `
`Close your eyes and chant with me..." `
`"Come, try closing your eyes. `
`And try to remember. `
`What form did you have? `
`It was surely a very, very beautiful form. `
`Please, show me that form one more time..." `
`Those words of power knocked forcefully on the door to the Land of the Dead. `
`The magic of her old self had performed that same forceful knock. `
`...However, doing it that way was horribly violent...and earned the displeasure of the peacefully sleeping dead... `
`But this time was different. `
`...It was very forceful...and yet gentle and loving. `
`The dead near the door opened their eyes... `
`and called out to the others that there was a voice calling for someone to come back. `
`...The sadness of that voice calling from the outside touched the hearts of the dead, `
`and, trying to respond as quickly as possible, they searched for Shannon's lost soul... `
`And then, `
`......they found it. `
`They found the casket in which Shannon was peacefully sleeping. `
`It truly was Shannon's soul, sleeping in the land of the dead. `
`...Inside the casket that was covered with rose flowers frozen with frost, she was sleeping in peace... `
`The dead silently lifted that casket up. `
`...While at a glance, it looked like a funeral march, it had the complete opposite meaning. `
`It was solemn, but filled with joy. `
`...The long-forgotten dead were made to remember `
`that they were loved after their deaths, `
`...and they were all given a warm sense of peace... `
`Then, ...as though guided by a warm light from the heavens, ...Shannon's body floated up out of the casket... `
`The dead watched her go. `
`...They squinted at that warm light, `
`offering their respect to this unknown member of the living...who had not lost his love for a person even after their death... `
`Shannon's body was enveloped in the light from the heavens and began to disappear... `
`In the jet-black darkness of the land of the dead, the faint flickering of gold butterflies could be seen. `
`...It reminded them of the gentle stars in the night sky, which they had long forgotten... `
`"............!" `
`George remembered being told that he must not say anything, and he hurriedly covered his mouth. `
`However, it felt like his heart was trying to jump into his throat. `
`...Because he had seen Shannon's eyelids shake slightly. `
`Then, ...those eyelids slowly opened. `
`Shannon's eyes were there, but they were still wrapped in the fog of the land of the dead. `
`However, ...the human world's warmth... `
`...No, her lover's warmth, which had called back her soul, slowly dissolved that fog, `
`......and her eyes gradually regained their sparkle. `
`Then, ......her eyes moved...and recognized George. `
`"...George...san......" `
`As her lips shook weakly, `
`...Shannon definitely said that. `
`The words were very faint. `
`So much so that they normally wouldn't have reached his ears. `
`...However, George clearly heard them. `
`......He heard the person he cared for, his fiancée, the one he loved most and who should have been dead, `
`call his name once again... `
`"Shannon, `
`......Shannon, `
`...do you... `
`...know who I am......?" `
`"...George-sa...n, `
`......is this...a dream......?" `
`"No. `
`This isn't a dream. `
`...C'mon, see here... ...Even if I pinch you, you won't wake up." `
`As George said that, he softly pinched Shannon's cheek. `
`...It was how George had always responded in the past, when Shannon had been surprised by something and had asked if she was dreaming. `
`When Shannon felt the warm touch of George's finger on her cheek... `
`...And when George realized that the warmth of the living had already returned to his beloved person's cheek... `
`...They both cried. `
`...What words should a pair of lovers separated by death celebrate with when they are reunited? `
`...The words of the human world are not enough. `
`In short, they had no need of the words of this world... `
`George simply hugged Shannon, who was sitting up, without talking. `
`Shannon's strength was still feeble...and putting her arms around George's back took all she had, `
`...so George hugged her tightly to make up for that. `
`To stop each other from going once more to a place the other's hand couldn't reach, `
`they hugged each other so tightly, and yet so gently... `
`As Shannon's fingers curled around George's back, `
`...on her ring finger, the engagement ring George had given her definitely shone. `
`That strong glint certainly wasn't just the sparkle of diamond. `
`...There definitely was a magical power that only the two lovers could possibly feel. `
`It was because that strong light existed...that they had been able to find her casket in the land of the dead. `
`Beato understood. `
`...That ring, ...no. `
`......The feelings of the pair, embodied in that ring, were a miracle made real. `
`In that moment, George definitely used magic. `
`Beato had done nothing more than help him along. `
`That magic had a power that could only reside in those who knew of the importance of life, who knew what it meant to try with all one's might. `
`It was the power of a miracle, one that the Endless Witch couldn't possibly know of... A miracle that only the power of the finite could give rise to. `
`By now, she had no choice but to accept it. `
`...She had to accept that true magic, true magical power... `
`...Exists in the place furthest away from she who called herself a Great Witch. `
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}...sama..." `
`"...She brought you back to life... `
`Thank you, {f:5:Beatrice}...!" `
`"No. `
`I did nothing. `
`...What revived Shannon...was your magical power. `
`It was your magic. `
`......The Ushiromiya blood, which makes miracles come true, ...surely saw you through." `
`"......George-san...revived me...?" `
`"...Indeed. `
`......It was an incredible display of magical power, one that I could not hope to compete with. `
`...So, I am still nothing more than an apprentice. `
`...Now I finally know my place." `
`Beato staggered backwards. `
`...Her physical strength was clearly exhausted. `
`She had humbly said that George's power alone had revived Shannon, but Beato had also used all of her magical and physical strength. `
`...And she reflected upon how difficult it was to revive a single life, `
`something she'd been able to play around with however she wanted to in the past. `
`The couple kept on embracing each other tightly. `
`...By doing that, those feelings that couldn't be communicated with a billion words...were shared... `
`"Thank you, {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`...We're in your debt..." `
`"...Thank you very much, {f:5:Beatrice}-sama. `
`...I'll never forget the debt I owe you for bringing me to George again." `
`"...Stop that, stop that. `
`Being thanked by a pair of lovers is far too embarrassing for one who has been feared as a monster of a person. `
`...Don't worry...about me. `
`...Celebrate your reunion together......to the fullest......" `
`Beato, who was leaning with her back against the wall, slid down the wall and sat. `
`How many centuries had it been since she last grew this tired from using magic? `
`...I probably haven't been this tired since the time I first succeeded in magic. `
`......Didn't Teacher praise me that time? `
`Oh, but didn't I kill that same Teacher who praised me? `
`...Don't be so naive, {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`...Isn't that what killing means...? `
`"...Finally. `
`...It seems you've finally remembered how to use magic." `
`"......My head...feels parched and suffocated, ...and I can't even remember... `
`...More importantly, ...didn't I kill you? `
`You shouldn't be appearing..." `
`"You are still allowing me to live even now. `
`That is why I can appear like this. `
`...However, I did not come just to pat your head." `
`"...Did you come to sneer at how pathetic I am? `
`...Anyway, ...if I have my head patted by a retired witch after all that's happened, the other witches will laugh at me..." `
`"That's right. `
`...According to your bragging, you were not only a full adult, but a retired one, `
`and yet only now have you learned how to use magic. That certainly does sound too embarrassing to tell anyone." `
`"......Yeah, tell me about it. `
`...Keep it a secret, okay, Teacheer...?" `
`Beato gazed at the couple hugging each other with a sense of pleasant despondency. `
`"Love, is it? `
`......I'm no match..." `
`"45, Data Received. `

`"410, Firing. `
`Nihi!" `
`The gold snake arrow fired by the Chiesters... `
`weaved its way through the bushes in the rose garden, `
`weaved its way through the hedges, `
`and climbed the stone steps towards the mansion's entrance, `
`aiming for the keyhole. `
`It weaved through the corridors... `
`and flew into the keyhole on the door to the parlor...! `
`"...Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh?!?!" `
`It happened in an instant. `
`...One could hardly blame Beato, who was completely worn out, for not noticing it beforehand. `
`Right before Beato's eyes, the gold snake flew in through the keyhole, `
`...surrounded the two lovers, `
`and pierced the two hearts in a blink of an eye. `
`...Furthermore, the gold snake faithfully pierced a hole through Shannon's chest once more... `
`The two hearts were pierced by that gold snake... `
`no, by that gold sewing thread of the new brutal witch's furniture, `
`......and it had happened in an instant, mocking the amount of effort it had taken to revive Shannon...! `
`Before Beato's shocked eyes, the two fell over and landed on the floor... `
`".........G‐ `
`George, `
`......Shannon......" `
`"......Thank you, `
`...{f:5:Beatrice}... `
`...For letting us meet, `
`...even just for a short while, `
`...thank you......" `
`George spent his last breath thanking Beato...and died alongside the one he loved. `
`The gold snake, which still sewed the two in place, spun like a large cyclone, revolving around the inside of the parlor. `
`......It was searching for further prey in that room. `
`Then, the tip of the snake met Beato's gaze... `
`In that instant, Beato was prepared to die. `
`At that moment, {f:5:Virgilia} stood in front of her, the fingers of both her hands drawing a seal. `
`Instantly, gold-colored gold leaf buried the inside of the parlor. `
`It was like a blizzard of gold... `
`"Beato, run while you can!! `
`{i:No one can escape} from the Chiesters' golden bow!!!" `

`Prey targeted by the Chiester Sisters' golden bow did not escape. `
`It could not be blocked. `
`...No magical barrier could even dream of blocking it without being multilayered. `
`The gap opened during that instant of confusion caused by {f:5:Virgilia}'s deception magic was Beato's only chance to escape. `
`And, it was the only chance to make the sisters confuse {f:5:Virgilia} for Beato. `
`As {f:5:Virgilia} spread her arms wide, blocking the way to her beloved disciple, the gold snake pierced straight through her heart... `
`After sneaking in through the keyhole, the snake shot through George, Shannon, and then {f:5:Virgilia} in an instant, `
`completely failing to notice Beato as she used that instant to escape... `
`As soon as {f:5:Virgilia} saw that Beato had gotten away, she died. `
`...The strength left her body, and like gold dust drifting with the wind, her form was erased... `
`Beato completely erased all traces of her magical power, `
`became gold butterflies, and passed through the wall, escaping to the wind and rain outside... `
`".........Damn it, `
`......damn it, damn it... `
`...You bitch, `
`...you biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitch...!!" `
`Beato felt regret from the bottom of her heart. `
`Why? `
`Because she had been attacked by the new witch? `
`Probably not. `
`Of course, she hated losing her teacher. `
`And even more importantly, Beato was enraged at the barbarism that had boorishly stolen away the reunion between two lovers. `
`...Beato had poured out almost all of her magical power to reunite them. `
`...Even though the result had been a miracle, `
`...the time it took to steal that away had been so ridiculously short...! `
`Beato trembled at the barbarous cruelty that had brought about such an abrupt end. `
`...Besides, ...this was the true form of the acts she herself had committed up until that point... `
`So just as strongly as Beato hated the new witch, she also looked at her previous self with disgust. `
`But now, she had to escape... `
`...If she was targeted next, she would probably lose her life. `
`To think that a chess player had descended, thinking they were like a god, `
`...only to be attacked by the pieces. `
`"45, Impact Confirmed, Target Scattered. `
`...W-Without a doubt, we crushed the Predecessor-sama...!" `
`"Looks like our pile of kill medals is gonna get bigger again nyeh. `
`Nihi!" `
`"What was that about loving couples? `
`You get to enjoy tearing the two apart by death, reuniting them, and then tearing them apart again, right? `
`*cackle* Hihihihihihhihi!" `
`"And along with that, I get to say goodbye to that damn fussy old hag. `
`...Ronove, you don't have any complaints, right?" `
`"...I do not, `
`{f:5:Beatrice}-sama." `
`"That person interfered with the ceremony of the witch's epitaph, you see? `
`She revived a sacrifice from the first twilight without permission, obstructing my ceremony. `
`She's got no right at all to complain." `
`"Kuhhihihihhyahyahyahya...! `
`But it sucks that she didn't leave a corpse behind. `
`...And I thought I'd be able to torture that old hag to death over and over again endlessly. `
`Kuhhihihyahyahya...!!" `
`"............" `
`"G-George did...?! `
`No, I didn't see him. When did he come down?!" `
`"...Wh-When, you say...? `
`Uh, what hour was that, again...?" `
`"I think...it was probably around 4:00 or 5:00. `
`...At the very least, it was more than an hour ago..." `
`"We got sleepy...and probably dozed off after that... `
`But I think it's probably like Jessica says. `
`About one or two hours ago." `
`"I-I also remember something from around that time. `
`I was asked if I wanted more coffee..." `
`Something hard to believe had happened... `
`Apparently, when Aunt Eva had left for a second to wash her hands, `
`Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi had disappeared. `
`There's no way they went hiding somewhere. `
`Of course, the doors and windows had all been rigorously checked, and all were locked from the inside. `
`Not one of them was broken. `
`And that wasn't just true for the first floor. The second floor was the same. `
`Again, all the doors and windows had locks built in a way that made it impossible to lock them from the outside. `
`...In other words, there was no way that Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi had gone outside. `
`...And yet, they couldn't be found. `
`Furthermore, they weren't the only ones who had disappeared. ...So had George-aniki, of all people. `
`George-aniki had left saying he was going to get more coffee, `
`and had gone downstairs more than an hour earlier. `
`We'd assumed that he was having a conversation with Aunt Eva and the rest, `
`...but Aunt Eva, who had been in the lobby the whole time, said that no one had come down. `
`Since all the doors and windows were locked from the inside, `
`...it was unthinkable that they had gone outside. `
`...However, three humans had evaporated from this barricaded guesthouse, which had become a perfect closed room... `
`In a situation like this, we couldn't imagine that this was because they were playing hide-and-seek and trying to scare us with a prank. `
`...It was probably reasonable to assume that they'd been caught up in this crime... `
`When Aunt Eva had learned that her only son was missing, `
`she had gone half insane, running from room to room and yelling his name. `
`...And Jessica, who had suddenly lost both of her parents, had chased after her. `
`Cries of "George, George" and "Mom, Dad" had continued to echo through the guesthouse for some time... `
`I think George said something about wanting to see Shannon's dead face. `
`...It would be reasonable to assume that he snuck out of the guesthouse and went to the mansion. `
`...But I didn't have a clue about Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi. `
`...Did they see him leave...and then go to the mansion to search for him...? `
`Without even telling Aunt Eva...? `
`At this rate, it's only a matter of time before we start planning to leave the guesthouse to go search for them. `
`......When that time comes, I'll agree. `
`We'd thought staying holed up in the guesthouse would be safe, `
`which was why our big, happy group of 12 people locked themselves up here this morning. `
`And yet, now there's only four of us left. `
`...That means staying here is no guarantee of safety... `
`However, ...there's one thing we can't afford to forget. `
`All the doors and windows were locked from the inside. `
`...This is a closed room. `
`How did they manage to vanish from this place? `
`We searched around thoroughly. `
`However, we couldn't find any traces of someone hiding. `
`...The three of them had almost certainly been taken outside the guesthouse. `
`"......I wonder how it was done... `
`You don't think...there might be something like a hidden door?" `
`"A hidden door...?" `
`"...The doors and the windows were built in a way that makes them impossible to lock from the outside. `
`Even using a fish line, it would probably be impossible with the way they're constructed. `
`So, it may be reasonable to assume that they left via something other than a door or a window..." `
`"......You're right. `
`That does make logical sense. `
`...No one can be sure that no hidden doors exist." `
`"...However, before leaping to that conclusion, I suspect a much simpler possibility." `
`"And...what would that be...?" `
`For some time, Battler had been opening windows, opening shutters, and checking outside, `
`repeating this for each window. `
`"......Hmm. `
`...This window's pretty quiet. `
`...I see, unlike the other windows, because of how the building's shaped, the wind doesn't blow into this one." `
`"It appears that way... `
`It feels strange that no wind or rain comes in, even though there is so much of it outside." `
`"Doctor Nanjo, `
`...when I opened the window just now, did you hear a sound?" `
`"Huh? `
`...No, I did not notice it... `
`I believe it is well oiled." `
`"In other words, `
`it's possible to slink through a window in the hallway when no one is looking. `
`Furthermore, the wind doesn't blow in through this window, `
`so the air pressure wouldn't cause the curtains or a door to make a sound. `
`It'd be quiet." `
`Battler leaned forward and looked at the ground below. `
`...He was searching for some sign that George had jumped down. `
`...But at a glance, he didn't see any mark like that on the grass in the middle of the pouring rain. `
`"...There might also be a window like this on the first floor. `
`It'd be possible to go outside without anyone noticing." `
`"However, not only the doors, but the windows too are all locked, and the shutters are even down as well, correct...? `
`It may be possible to go out through them, but you couldn't lock them afterwards..." `
`"Sure you can lock them. `
`Just like this, *click*" `
`Battler closed the window and locked it, as though this was perfectly obvious. `
`"......B-Battler-san, you aren't saying........." `
`"If someone inside locked it afterwards, this closed room is as easy as pie." `
`"B-But that means `
`......that means, `
`...ooooooohhhh..." `
`Nanjo turned pale and shook his head several times. `
`...Because the thing Battler had said had forced him to face a fact that was frightening even to imagine... `
`"...That's only if the trick I'm thinking of actually happened, okay? `
`However, with this trick, only a very limited number of people can be suspected." `
`He didn't want to say it in front of Nanjo, ...but after eliminating Jessica, who had been with him the whole time, `
`only Nanjo...and Eva could have done it. `
`"I-I did not do anything of the sort...! `
`Y-Yes, I swear it...!!" `
`"...In this case, it becomes a battle between Aunt Eva and Doctor Nanjo for an alibi. `
`...We just have to suspect both of you, `
`and confine the two of you separately." `
`"......To say it the other way around, the more survivors there are, the more effective this trick might be, `
`but since our numbers have shrunk so much, it isn't effective at all." `
`...No, on the contrary, there'd be a chance of having your own neck strangled by using it. `
`...It would have been more advantageous to make it look like the culprit was outside, `
`to intentionally leave a door unlocked or break a window... `
`"......If this disappearance drama had taken place midday today, `
`I'd be able to claim this theory with full confidence. `
`...However, at this stage, I'm not confident at all. `
`......What's going on here? `
`...What in the world does it mean? `
`......This "closed room"..." `
`"...Y-You don't think, umm......" `
`"Hmm? `
`What is it, Doctor Nanjo? `
`...Even if it's just a thought, please say it." `
`Nanjo looked like he was trying to swallow his words, even though he'd thought of something, so I urged him on. `
`After Doctor Nanjo refused several times, saying that it was just a foolish idea, he finally said it out loud. `
`"...Well, umm, `
`......don't you think this might actually be... `
`...the work of the witch...?" `
`"R-Ridiculous. `
`There's no way witches exist." `
`"...The witch is trying to make her case to us. `
`...Specifically because she's doing things that humans cannot do, `
`...she must be trying to make us accept her as a witch. `
`...To me, this disappearance from the closed room of the entire guesthouse...feels like that kind of message from the witch... `
`......It's something I must not think of. `
`Surely, it cannot mean anything. `
`...Oooh, ...I...I am frightened..." `
`As Doctor Nanjo shook with fear, it looked like he was he was trying to erase the fearsome thoughts that he kept imagining one after the other. `
`...When we went down the stairs, Aunt Eva and Jessica were enraged, `
`and were each persistent in their desire to leave this place and search for their respective families. `
`It was a desire that naturally hits those who can no longer see their family. `
`Aunt Eva told Doctor Nanjo and me to stay here, but I shook my head and started walking. `
`"......I've been shut up inside for a long time already. `
`...I've started wanting to breathe some outside air." `
`"Yeah, if we're going, let's go quickly...!! `
`There's no way I'm gonna keep myself shut up in a place like this any more...!! `
`Let's go and find Mom, Dad, and George nii-san right now...!!" `
`The blood had all risen to Jessica's head. `
`...I hope it doesn't set off her asthma. `
`"If anyone wants to stay, go ahead and stay. `
`We'll be searching outside...!" `
`"What about you, Doctor Nanjo...? `
`Will you watch the place by yourself...?" `
`"N-No... `
`Allow me to join you..." `
`Rather than holing up alone in a guesthouse whose security was by no means guaranteed, `
`it would be better to enter a danger zone as a group of four people. `
`Aunt Eva had a gun. `
`Moving separately from her was almost like asking to be made into the next victim. `
`In this way, the four of us decided to leave the guesthouse. `
`...Even though it should have been safe to barricade ourselves here, ...we lost eight people after doing so. `
`It was almost as though it this was a holding cell from which the sacrifices could be killed one after another. `
`We removed the chain, unlocked the front door and opened it. `
`It was already pitch black. `
`While there were some lights outside that dimly lit the pathway, `
`...they didn't have enough power to pierce the darkness that some suspicious person might be hiding in. `
`"I'm going...! `
`If you fall behind, you're on your own, okay...?!" `
`Still holding her gun, Aunt Eva dashed out without an umbrella. `
`Jessica followed after her. `
`After glancing at each other, Doctor Nanjo and I chased after them. `
`...What in the world is happening in this mansion, on this island? `
`I've just been shut up in the guesthouse with the rest of the cousins since yesterday. `
`So I don't know anything about what's going on outside. `
`Just what is happening that I don't know about... `
`outside this room, in the mansion, on this island? `
`...Everything is happening, everything is proceeding, `
`...and everything is ending without my knowing it. `
`Somewhere in my heart, I've already started giving up. `
`...Most likely, ...not one of us will see tomorrow morning. `
`When the seagulls cry, nobody will be left alive... `
