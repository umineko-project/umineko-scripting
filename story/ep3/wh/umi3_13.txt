`".........zzzzz..." `
`".........Whew. `
`...Looks like she's finally calmed down..." `
`Hideyoshi wiped his own forehead. `
`...For a time, Eva had seemed to be having a very painful nightmare, but it appeared she'd finally fallen asleep. `
`As promised, he still gripped Eva's hand. `
`...He'd thought it might be time to let go pretty soon, but he faithfully continued to hold on. `
`Every once in a while, his hand would get tired, and he would switch between his right and his left, `
`but even so, as promised, he didn't let go of her hand... `
`At that time, there was a heavy knock. `
`Eva had finally been able to fall asleep, so Hideyoshi grimaced for just an instant. `
`"...Aneki, Hideyoshi-san, sorry. `
`Is Rosa there...?" `
`It was Rudolf's voice. `
`...What could it be? `
`Hideyoshi headed for the door, hiding his footsteps so that he wouldn't wake Eva. `
`...It was definitely Rudolf's voice, but just in case, he opened the door without removing the chain. `
`"What is it? `
`Somethin' happen to Rosa-san?" `
`"We can't find Rosa or Maria-chan. `
`I thought they might be with you." `
`"...I heard her scolding Maria-chan in the corridor. `
`They got quiet after that, so I thought they'd gone back to the lobby, ...but did they...?" `
`"......That idiot..." `
`Rudolf clicked his tongue. `
`Other people could be seen in the corridor. `
`Rosa hadn't returned for a while after going out into the corridor, so they'd begun to worry. `
`Near the front door, Natsuhi pointed at the unset chain. `
`"...The chain isn't set. `
`They must have gone outside to see that rose after all." `
`"How extraordinarily careless, to go out and leave the door unlocked. `
`What a troublesome person." `
`"...I'm more worried about Rosa-san and Maria-chan themselves." `
`"Right. `
`...Hey, brats. `
`Where was this rose of Maria's?!" `
`"I'm pretty sure...it was in the flower bed right in the middle of the rose garden..." `
`"If that's where they are, we should be able to spot them pretty quickly if we go." `
`"...Dad, shouldn't we bring them back here as soon as we can...?" `
`"Of course. `
`We'll bring them back and give 'em a good spanking. `
`I'll dash out there and come back. `
`Lock the door as soon as I go out." `
`"...Dad, I'll go with you." `
`"Don't be stupid. `
`It's obviously a brat's job to watch over the house with Mama." `
`"......What is it...? `
`Did something happen...?" `
`"Sorry, did I wake you up...? `
`...It seems Rosa-san took Maria-chan outside. `
`...How reckless of her." `
`"Rosa and Maria-chan are... `
`...outside...? `
`In the rose garden...?!" `
`"That's right. `
`...Oh, did you hear? `
`Maria-chan was causin' a ruckus because she wanted to see this rose." `
`"...Th-They mustn't... `
`...They mustn't go to the rose garden...! `
`Tell Rosa to stop...!" `
`"Th-There's no tellin' her to stop now, it looks like they left a while ago. `
`...Seriously, how reckless of them." `
`"......That's not it... `
`...Not the rose garden... `
`...There's a witch there, `
`...and she's waiting for a sacrifice...! `
`Rosa, you mustn't go, `
`...ooooooooooohhh..." `
`...Eva cowered again, holding her head. `
`...Her complexion looked very bad. `
`"What is it? `
`Did the fever make you dream somethin' bad?" `
`"......It's a dream, `
`...yes... `
`......In the rose garden, the witch, doing that to Rosa and Maria-chan... `
`......That's right. `
`...It's a dream... `
`It must be..." `
`"Calm down. `
`I'm here in this room. `
`And the chain is set. `
`The shutter's closed on the window, and we've even got a gun. `
`This room is just like a fort. `
`There's nothin' to be afraid of." `
`Hideyoshi beat his chest, trying to calm her, but Eva's insecure expression didn't change. `
`...Under the covers, Eva kept praying `
`that the grotesque nightmare she'd just had was only a dream... `
`"In the center of the rose garden, Rudolf identified the corpses of Rosa and Maria. `
`After that, he returned to the guesthouse, called for help, and carried both of them into the guesthouse." `
`"If we can trust Nanjo's examination, the cause of Rosa's death was a stab to the medulla oblongata with the pointed gate of the fence. `
`It is thought that Maria's death was due to strangling with bare hands. `
`However, due to the 'Devil's Proof', we cannot discount a misdiagnosis." `
`"...I will say it in red. `
`{p:1:Rosa and Maria died}. `
`{p:1:The causes of death were as Nanjo diagnosed}. `
`...She wasn't eaten by a spider, nor was she crushed by a mountain of cake. `
`Don't worry." `
`"......So, you argue that even though you toyed with their deaths so much, it's all fine because the corpse is neat and clean...? `
`I definitely won't forgive you." `
`"...I definitely won't forget all of that brutal treatment you gave Aunt Rosa, `
`so I won't forgive you..." `
`"...L-Like I said, that wasn't me... `
`...I believe I gave them a much more peaceful death than the way she treated them..." `
`"Shut the hell up. `
`I'm not talking to you." `
`"......It was stated that there are no more than 18 people on this island, and now that eight people are already dead, `
`we can narrow the field of suspects down to ten. `
`One of them probably killed those two." `
`"...Or could it also be an accidental death? `
`Like Maria was having a tantrum, `
`and when Aunt Rosa tried to stop her crying, she misjudged how much power she was using and accidentally killed her. `
`Then she was so upset that she slipped and fell, landed on the fence, and unluckily, died." `
`"...How's that? `
`That way there's no need for a witch or magic." `
`"...Well, that's not quite true. `
`Actually, Rosa and Maria..." `
`"Shut up. `
`Didn't I say I wasn't talking to you? `
`You're an eyesore, so disappear. `
`You monster." `
`Battler said that without rage, ...but with a horribly cold voice. `
`...That strange behavior was something Beato had noticed right off the bat. `
`In a fight, both of them could go at each other without restraint. `
`However, he wouldn't even step into the ring. `
`She could feel that coldness. `
`Beato didn't find that amusing. `
`...She thought about flaring up, but she held back. `
`Maybe even though she was innocent and childish, `
`she had enough sense to realize that she shouldn't pick fights. `
`"...... `
`......Is that so? `
`Then I'll vanish. `
`...Ronove, continue for me." `
`"Certainly. `
`...Will that be satisfactory, Battler-sama?" `
`"......There are no problems with her proposal. `
`If Battler-kun doesn't want to see Beato's face, perhaps that will do." `
`"Do what you like. `
`...If I can live without seeing that monstrous face, I don't care about anything else." `
`"...Hey, wait a second. `
`...You keep saying monster, monster, but isn't that a cruel way to speak of me? `
`...Why do you instinctively hate me so much, Battler? `
`Even though none of that was me, even though it was all the work of my disciple..." `
`"......It's not like I'm only mad about what happened just now. `
`It's been like that from the very beginning." `
`"Hey, Battleer. `
`Don't misunderstand, okay...? `
`Aren't we just a pair of players confronting each other through a game? `
`...We look for moves to make things painful for each other, but..." `
`"Don't get the wrong idea. `
`I don't hate you because you're my rival in this strange game about whether I accept you as a witch or not. `
`...I just can't forgive how senselessly cruel you are." `
`"Well, serial murders are a part of this game... `
`It's probably impossible to avoid a little cruelty..." `
`"I'm not just talking about what just happened. `
`There was the last time, and the time before that too. `
`...Tearing everyone's stomachs open and stuffing them with sweets, plowing their faces... `
`What was the point of all that?" `
`"......That's... `
`well..." `
`"When it comes to closed room murders and tricks and alibis, `
`I'm willing to give you a pass. `
`You want to claim that this is a murder done by magic, `
`so I'll grudgingly accept that those complicated crimes need to occur." `
`"...But what exactly is the point of all those grotesque murders?" `
`"......Well, umm, `
`......nothing much..." `
`"That's right. `
`They don't mean anything. `
`You're just fooling around by mangling the corpses for fun. `
`That has nothing to do with whether you're a witch, or whether it could or couldn't be done with magic." `
`"You're just exploring the depths of cruelty for fun. `
`This isn't about whether you're a witch, or anything like that. `
`There are just some things I can't forgive as a human." `
`"......Wh- `
`What do you mean, as a human...?" `
`"For example, `
`...the six people of the first twilight for this game. `
`...Well, other than Grandfather being burned black, `
`the other corpses were killed in a normal way, without any unnecessary shaming of the dead. `
`...It wasn't clear whether the weapon was a spear or a gun, but anyway, as far as killing goes, that was acceptable. `
`It was much better than the nonsensical grotesqueness and cruelty from the first twilight last time, or the time before that." `
`"And this time, there were six closed rooms tied together to make a closed room chain. `
`...That was sort of interesting." `
`"When we were going back and forth with each other that time, to be perfectly honest, I thought it was just a little fun." `
`"...You were frantic to make me accept your existence, and I was frantic trying to deny it. `
`...We were both frantically doing all we could." `
`"This may sound weird, but I've felt a faint sense of sportsmanship between the two of us. `
`...We exist in conflict, `
`but I faintly thought that we might not be completely unable to understand each other's existence." `
`"......But just now, that feeling was blown away without a trace." `
`"Th-That's what you're misunderstanding...! `
`That wasn't me-" `
`"That's not it. `
`That's not what I'm talking about! `
`...You watched Aunt Rosa being killed horribly over and over, `
`and you sneered at it like it was an interesting show." `
`...When I saw that, I was deeply disappointed in you. `
`When I realized that your decision to kill them in a slightly better way this time was nothing more than a faint whim, `
`...and that nothing had changed in your cruel character, I was deeply disappointed. `
`On the contrary, you were even genuinely enjoying those brutal deaths. `
`You weren't just acting as cruel as you could to bully me. `
`...You truly, genuinely enjoy cruelty. `
`Your character lets you enjoy it. `
`You said I'd probably think that Aunt Rosa being brutally killed over and over was fun. `
`You weren't joking. `
`You enjoyed it from the bottom of your heart, wanted me to sympathize, and said that I'd probably think it was fun. `
`...In that instant, I lost respect for you and realized the truth. `
`"The problem isn't whether you're a witch or not. `
`...I will not forgive that cruelty of yours. `
`And I can't understand it! `
`I can't forgive it, either! `
`Still, I'll continue this game of whether to accept or deny witches. `
`I won't step down and accept my own defeat." `
`"However, your pointless cruelty is absolutely unnecessary for that game. `
`So I've decided that I won't accept you as my opponent. `
`Ronove is a hundred times better. `
`He doesn't have the same cruel hobby you do. `
`Even if he does, he doesn't have the awful taste to show it off in front of me." `
`"...That's right, you have awful taste. `
`You're heartless and cruel, so you can't understand. `
`That's unpleasant in an opponent. `
`So I don't want to see your face again." `
`As Battler went on and on by himself, Beato was shocked into silence for a long time. `
`Maybe she couldn't understand what she was being told, `
`and this was a sign that she was doing all she could in an effort to understand. `
`For a while, she kept switching between angry expressions, frustrated expressions, bold expressions, `
`...as though even she herself didn't know what attitude she should take. `
`In the end, she made her face into a candid expression, as though she had come to her senses, `
`and shrugged her shoulders as though she was tired. `
`"......... `
`......In that case, do as you like. `
`From now on, I will continue this game through Ronove. `
`...You have no complaints as long as I don't show myself, right?" `
`"...For the time being. `
`But I definitely won't forgive all of your cruel actions up until now. `
`And I definitely won't accept you. `
`For that reason as well, I won't back down from this fight you've picked. `
`And I definitely won't lose. `
`...That's all there is to it." `
`"......Beato, `
`no matter how many more excuses you give, his impression will not waver. `
`...I have something to talk about later. `
`Until then, stay back." `
`".........I-Indeed... `
`...Understood. `
`...Then I'll vanish until you call..." `
`Looking lonely, Beato turned her back to them and vanished. `
`...Battler watched, a slightly displeased expression on his face. `
`He thought his argument had been valid, but for some reason, his mood didn't clear up. `
`"...She's... `
`an idiot." `
`"......That's true. `
`An idiot, and a straightforward one." `
`"That idiot watched Aunt Rosa get killed horribly with me, `
`then turned around with a huge smile on her face. `
`...She really believed that she could laugh with me at that cruel show. `
`...She really believed that I could sympathize with that emotion..." `
`"Looking at that innocent smile, I felt just horrible. `
`...It would've been much better if she'd said it with her normal bullying face... `
`...Damn it..." `
`"Milady has never had the experience of having a friend. `
`...In addition, she has probably never had something spoken to her that strongly." `
`"Madam and I are her attendants. `
`No matter what we say, it will not reach her ears. `
`For Milady, this is also-" `
`"Don't screw with me. `
`I don't remember ever becoming her friend." `
`"...That's true enough. `
`My apologies." `
`"......... `
`...There is one thing I would like to thank you for. `
`...Thank you for not backing down from that child's game." `
`She spoke words of gratitude, but for some reason, Battler made a displeased face. `
`Then as though in self-derision, he chuckled. `
`"Now that I've even got witches and demons thanking me, I'm screwed. `
`...Let's resume the game. `
`Of course, I don't intend to go easy on you." `
`"I wouldn't have it any other way. `
`Unlike Milady, I do not get agitated." `
`"...I've already made my move. `
`If we suppose that Aunt Rosa is the culprit and died in an accident, I can deny the witch. `
`...I don't want to suspect Aunt Rosa, but I think I can bear to accept that premise if it'll beat the hell out of Beato." `
`"I will deny it with red. `
`{p:1:Rosa's and Maria's deaths were homicides}." `
`"Okay. `
`...Let's start from there. `
`......Damn, I'm just not getting fired up." `
`With Rosa's and Maria's deaths, it was now clear that the culprit was still hiding somewhere, `
`trying to add even more murders to this chain. `
`As he shed tears, Rudolf scolded Rosa's corpse for being reckless several times, `
`but Rosa would never respond to that again. `
`They decided to place the two corpses in one of the guest rooms...and to seal it until the police arrived... `
`The second murder...no, the murder of the second twilight had delivered a heavy blow to everyone. `
`It had blown away the optimism that some of them had held, `
`the thought that 'a crime didn't actually occur, and it was all a game or a farce by Kinzo and the servants'. `
`Trying to distract themselves from the loss of the people they liked, `
`George and Jessica had spent the whole time since morning talking about every possibility. `
`...And, they had distracted their hearts `
`by supposing that these murders might actually have all been an act, `
`and that Shannon and Kanon were only pretending to be dead. `
`When the next murder occurred, it destroyed that thought, `
`...and they were once again struck by the fact that the person they liked had most definitely been killed... `
`The tears that they'd thought had died away began to drip down once more, and Battler couldn't think of anything to say to them... `
`After that, all of the adults checked that all of the rooms were safe and locked, just in case. `
`They made certain that the shutters on all of the windows were down and locked, and they confirmed that no one suspicious was hiding anywhere. `
`On top of that, they checked their weapons once again... `
`and checked with each other to make sure they were mentally prepared, so that they wouldn't hesitate to fire off a preemptive shot if they saw the shadow of a mysterious person. `
`Rosa's gun had been found near the scene of the crime. `
`Someone had gone out of their way to leave it there, so everyone suspected that it was some kind of trap, `
`but when Hideyoshi delicately used a fire iron to fire off test shots, it was able to discharge without incident. `
`So, since the five shots loaded into it had discharged without any problems, `
`they reloaded it with bullets and handed it over to the only adult male who wasn't armed, Hideyoshi. `
`However, the fact that it had been able to fire off five shots gave rise to a certain paranoia. `
`This short barrel Winchester could hold only five shots. `
`In other words, Rosa hadn't fired even once. `
`And yet, the two had probably been killed by someone with their bare hands. `
`This meant there was a possibility that the crime had been committed by someone whose face they knew... `
`"...When the first murder occurred, `
`I privately thought of the possibility that it was all an act. `
`...My apologies to Doctor Nanjo, `
`but if he had actually been an accomplice, `
`I thought the deaths of all the servants might possibly have been a massive, elaborate act by Father." `
`"...After all, the closed room situation they were in couldn't have been created unless we suppose that it was all an act." `
`"...We also... `
`suspected that. `
`...No, `
`...I still want to believe that's the case." `
`"......My apologies, ...but that is not so. `
`...I am quite old. `
`I might possibly make a misdiagnosis. `
`...However, I would never mistake whether they were alive or dead..." `
`"I get it! `
`Don't go out of your way to say it out loud, Doctor Nanjo...!" `
`"...My apologies..." `
`They had no way of knowing, `
`but Beato had already used the red to proclaim the deaths of the six... `
`no, the deaths of all victims so far in this game. `
`That faint dream that it was all a farce, that the victims were actually alive... `
`I'm sorry to say it, but that's impossible... `
`"...In that case, it makes more sense to assume it's someone familiar with the mansion, `
`someone hiding around and carrying out a really well-polished crime. `
`So, ever since the typhoon came to this island and sealed it off from the outside world, there's been more than 18 people here." `
`Of course, there was no way for them to know about that either. `
`That claim of Rudolf's has also been denied in red. `
`There are no more than 18 humans on this island... `
`"I might have a way to look at it that keeps things consistent, at least a little. `
`...Simply put, this person in hiding is someone who shouldn't really be on this island right now. `
`And yet, there's a likelihood that they were someone Rosa-san knew, someone she'd let her guard down around." `
`"......S‐ `
`So, for example, `
`could it be...a servant who wasn't on this two-day shift...?" `
`"Hmm... `
`...It's hard to be certain about that one. `
`When our servants finish their work and leave the island, it isn't as though we punch their ticket or something to make sure. `
`If we're supposing that a servant on a shift from a few days ago only pretended to leave the island and actually stayed here, `
`that would be hard to deny..." `
`"...I don't think Rosa-san is such a fool. `
`If a servant who wasn't supposed to be here popped up in front of you, who wouldn't be on their guards...?" `
`"......I'm not even sure we should be assuming that it was someone she recognized. `
`...Maybe they suddenly attacked Rosa from the darkness and were about to steal her gun. `
`Then Rosa fell, hit her head against the fence, and stopped moving. `
`The guesthouse was nearby and they wanted to avoid the sound of gunfire, so they killed Maria-chan with their bare hands..." `
`"...There's also that possibility. `
`...Still, even if that is the case, `
`would they really intentionally leave Rosa's gun at the scene of the crime? `
`We don't know what the culprit's armed with, but they've got to feel insecure about our guns. `
`...Wasn't that a perfect chance for them to thin out our supply? `
`Why would they intentionally leave it at the scene of the crime?" `
`"At first, I thought that gun was a trap. `
`...That's what chessboard thinking says it should be. `
`By purposefully leaving it, they wanted to make one of us touch it. `
`And they must have wanted to make us pull the trigger. `
`...I was sure that something dangerous had been done to it...to make it explode and cause massive injuries." `
`"But, it was actually okay. `
`...The culprit probably panicked. `
`I'll bet that right now, they're regrettin' that they missed their chance to steal a gun...!" `
`"......I don't like it. `
`It ticks me off, like it's a message from the witch, saying she isn't even scared of guns." `
`"...However, in any event, this is truly a fearsome opponent. `
`Even at a glance, they should have been able to tell that Rosa had a gun. `
`To think that they attacked her despite that. `
`...The fact that they are unafraid of guns should not be taken lightly." `
`"Indeed... `
`It's as Natsuhi says. `
`...We should probably be even more cautious than we have been." `
`"This is just for peace of mind, but... `
`...at the time we think Rosa-san was attacked outside, `
`where was everyone...?" `
`"Natsuhi and I were here, along with Rudolf and Kyrie-san. `
`I can guarantee their alibis." `
`"Eva and I were together. `
`I can guarantee that." `
`"George-aniki, Jessica, and I were together. `
`...When Aunt Rosa yelled at us to return to the second floor, `
`we retraced our steps back to the cousins' room, all dejected." `
`"...Back then, `
`...if we hadn't let Maria go..." `
`"Saying that isn't going to change anything..." `
`"......Doctor Nanjo?" `
`"I-I was reading a book in a room on the second floor. `
`...I was by myself, so no one can verify my alibi, `
`but I believe everyone saw me return to the second floor with the children." `
`"...Once I say this, it'll never end, `
`but what if you jumped out the window, attacked Rosa, `
`then climbed back up using a rain gutter or something...?" `
`"D-D-Don't be absurd... `
`How could I perform a feat such as jumping down from the second story or climbing up with this old body...?" `
`"...Let us stop `
`suspecting each other... `
`It's more important that we trust each other and, for the children's sakes as well, defend this place until the very end." `
`"You're right... `
`...It's like Natsuhi-san says. `
`......For now, let's stop suspecting each other." `
`"That's right. `
`We may be useless as far as searching for the culprit is concerned. `
`...We can only stay alive until tomorrow, inform the police, and follow their instructions. `
`Because the police will definitely expose who the culprit is." `
`"......What is it, Eva? `
`...Is your body still feelin' bad...?" `
`"M-Mother, what's wrong? `
`Are you okay...?" `
`"...Sorry. `
`...It looks like my fever is still strong. `
`I'll be fine, so leave me alone..." `
`When they looked, they saw Eva staring at the floor, her breathing harsh again. `
`...She had been able to act firm for a time, due to the urgency of their situation, `
`but it seemed her body wasn't at its best after all... `
`"Yeah. `
`I killed those two. `
`Now, we're the only ones who know about the gold. `
`I won't give up even a scrap to the other siblings." `
`"......What have you done...?! `
`There was so much of that gold, right?! `
`Giving Rosa and the others their share wouldn't have been a problem at all, right...?!" `
`"It would. `
`...That gold is to be passed on only to the Head of the Ushiromiya family. `
`That's because it, as a whole, represents no more or less than the honor of the Head." `
`"...To wound that even a tiny bit... `
`is definitely not something that I, the new Golden Witch, Beatrice, will permit. `
`...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!" `
`"...Do you plan to continue these murders according to the witch's epitaph...? `
`Do you actually plan to become a murderer five more times...?" `
`"Yeah. `
`If I don't finish that annoying ceremony, it seems my power as a witch won't become complete. `
`...Hey, 'me'. `
`...The power of the witch is really awesome. `
`It really can make all the crazy things we imagine become reality. `
`The power to make dreams more than just dreams...! `
`Now that I've learned of this power, I can no longer stop being a witch. `
`If I can finish the ceremony and make my power complete, I'm sure I'll be able to teach you that feeling too. `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"Stop acting like an fool...! `
`Haven't you played at being a witch enough? `
`We found the gold. `
`And we've even been promised the position of the Successor. `
`We'll probably need to tightrope walk just a bit, but by now, that's a dream that will definitely come true. `
`...Beyond that, what more could you wish for...?!" `
`"I wanted to become a witch." `
`"I don't give a damn about that dream...!" `
`"That's right. `
`Because I kept holding onto that dream, I've lived at this age forever. `
`...When you became an adult, you threw that dream away." `
`"...No matter how long you wait, the rabbit holding a clock won't visit you, `
`and you won't be able to meet Humpty Dumpty. `
`Of course, you definitely won't be invited to the land of cards. `
`Because you gave up and accepted all that, you became an adult." `
`"So you don't want to become a witch or anything like that anymore. `
`...You've even forgotten that it truly was your own dream at one point." `
`"...Anyway, stop it! `
`I've already gotten my hands on two dreams! `
`The gold and the position of Head. `
`That's more than enough! `
`So please, your dream has nothing to do with me! `
`Stand down...!!" `
`"......No waaay. `
`Magic's too interesting. `
`...Also, those two dreams of yours both came true because of my magic. `
`It wouldn't be fair if my dream didn't come true too." `
`"I'm grateful for your magic, and I acknowledge that you're a real witch. `
`...So just stand down and return to the inside of my heart! `
`And never appear again!!" `
`"No wa-y. `
`...We're both misunderstanding each other, aren't we? `
`That's right, I am not you anymore. `
`You are Ushiromiya Eva. `
`I am the Golden Witch, Beatrice. `
`So it's not my responsibility to go back inside your heart. `
`...I guess I feel like a butterfly who's broken out of her cocoon, meaning you." `
`"............haah, `
`...haah... `
`...urg, `
`...the fever... `
`is making my mind cloudy..." `
`"My inexperience with magical power is forcing me support it with your vitality. `
`Until I finish the ceremony and become a full witch, you might have to bear the burden. `
`I'll take that as payment for making two of your dreams come true." `
`"...It's fine, don't worry, okay? `
`For the remaining five sacrifices, I'll avoid your family." `
`"Let's see, Rudolf, Kyrie, Krauss, Natsuhi. `
`...After that, what about that old geezer Nanjo? `
`Perfect, I'll kill those five people. `
`*giggle*giggle* Could you call this a murder announcement revealed only to yoouu? `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!" `
`Eva finally crouched down. `
`Hideyoshi rushed up to her and lent her his shoulder... `
`"...Are you okay? `
`...Let's take it easy and rest!" `
`"Are you all right...? `
`Doctor Nanjo, take a look at Eva...!" `
`When Nanjo and George tried to approach, Eva made a gesture to stop them. `
`"...Thank you. `
`I'm fine, Doctor Nanjo. `
`I'm taking medicine. `
`...I apologize for saying this during such an extreme situation, `
`...but let me rest a little longer..." `
`"Mom, ...I'll lend a hand too..." `
`"Thank you, `
`but I'll be fine as long as your father watches over me. `
`...Go back to the second story cousins' room and don't come out no matter what. `
`...Understood...? `
`No matter what happens, you must not leave the guesthouse... `
`...Outside, `
`...that...witch will... `
`uuuu..." `
`"Don't talk anymore...! `
`Sorry, everyone, but I'll be watching over Eva in our room. `
`Tell us if something happens." `
`Hideyoshi and Eva retreated from the lobby. `
`...However, Eva wasn't the only one who wasn't feeling good. `
`They hadn't gotten a wink of sleep since the previous night...and had been pressed by tension since that morning. `
`...They were mustering their energy to protect their families, `
`but if they relaxed even a little, surely everyone would be down and out... `
`"...Everything has gone as planned until now, but from here on out, it will become difficult, you see?" `
`"Difficult, meaning...?" `
`"Indeed. `
`Normally, as the ceremony progresses and the victims increase in number, they begin to tighten their guard, `
`and in most cases, they hole up in one place and stop moving. `
`That is extremely inconvenient for us." `
`"...Are you saying that we witches are inferior to a bunch of Humans in a group...?" `
`"Witches are never inferior to Humans... `
`However, perhaps you could say that times change, and that Humans have gotten their hands on a poison... `
`...This wasn't a problem long ago, when people believed in witches, `
`but just like that annoyance Battler, people in the current era deny magic on a fundamental level." `
`"In other words, their existence itself is anti-magical. `
`As a result, at some point, they grew to possess a toxin inside their bodies that denies magic." `
`"In other words, you're saying that the more Humans there are, `
`the stronger that magic-resisting toxin gets, and the greater the disadvantage is for us witches?" `
`"...The combined amount of power in their hearts that denies magic...in other words, their magic resistance power, becomes the denominator in the equation of your magic's power... `
`Understand? `
`Is that a bit too difficult for you...?" `
`"You're joking. `
`Actually, I understand it easily. `
`...In other words, you're saying that the more people there are who don't believe in magic, `
`and the stronger their will is, the more the effects of our magic are divided. `
`...Yeah, if it's so formulaic, I'll have to rethink my method of attack." `
`Fundamentally, magic possesses a vast power. `
`It can even make a rain of fire fall from the heavens or divide a sea, and reviving a lost life isn't impossible either. `
`However, that power is extremely weak against the toxin that rejects it. `
`And that toxin started piling up in Humans since the time they forgot to respect things sacred, `
`...until finally, this earth was covered with enough toxin that the miracles of magic could not be displayed. `
`Thus, witches from across the world were chased from their dwellings. `
`...They had been forced to choose to throw away their magic and live as Humans, or else live in hiding in remote areas where the toxin of Humans didn't reach. `
`In that sense, Rokkenjima, with its population of only a few dozen humans, was extremely favorable for witches. `
`And even more favorable was the existence of the ghost story about the witch who lived in the Rokkenjima forest. `
`...In other words, by permeating the island with the fear that a witch might exist, `
`the magic-resisting toxin from the Humans was weakened. `
`A small population...and room for them to acknowledge magical beings. `
`In other words, minds that were only weakly anti-magical. `
`...Only by existing in the valley where those two converged...could a witch live in modern times... `
`"I see... `
`...So, using this formula, we can arrive at several rules for how a witch can use her power efficiently." `
`"The first is presentation. `
`Create a murder scene that couldn't conceivably have been done by Humans, decorate it in an occult way, `
`make it look very much like a witch exists, and permeate people with fear to make them believe that witches exist. `
`As a result, the anti-magic power and the denominator for our magical power will be decreased. `
`...I see, so this is why the creepy magic circles of the first twilight were created?" `
`"Th-That's right, exactly...! `
`The gaudy scenes for the first twilight in each game are all for that reason. `
`It's definitely not as though I like being cruel or am doing it for fun..." `
`"...In that case, Predecessor-sama, `
`you failed this time around. `
`You killed them in a very plain way. `
`It doesn't look like anything more than a simple mystery." `
`"......I heard about last time and the time before that from Ronove. `
`You should've damaged the corpses more grotesquely, like you did then, making it look more like fantasy and instilling fear in those people." `
`"......W-Well, about that. `
`...I thought it wouldn't be artful to do that every time, you see...? `
`Don't think too deeply on it, it's just a whim...!" `
`Actually, it really had been her whim. `
`After what Battler had said to her, she couldn't say it out loud anymore, `
`but she really had decided her methods of killing based on mere whims. `
`No, would it be better to say that she had halfheartedly let Ronove decide? `
`After all, she left the closed rooms of this game's first twilight to him. `
`But if she'd had a cruel idea, then she would surely have explored the limits of atrocity even worse than in the previous game... `
`"............ `
`You told me to show some restraint when deciding Rosa's and Maria's deaths too, `
`but that wasn't a course of action beneficial to us witches either, was it?" `
`"In actuality, by now, none of them believe one bit that a witch actually exists. `
`They're totally sure that it's a mystery, not a fantasy. `
`This turn of events is a failure from a witch perspective. `
`...For some reason, you keep doing things in a kinda lukewarm way, Predecessor-sama." `
`"Aah, ...l-like they say, things you learn when you're young will definitely help you out in the future...! `
`This is a test passed on from my predecessor to you. `
`Take it on with respect. `
`Wahahaha...!" `
`Beato tried to laugh heartily, `
`but it was obviously the fake laugh of someone trying to cover something up, `
`and the new witch shrugged with a sigh. `
`"............ `
`...At this stage, it's probably too late to create a scene and reduce the anti-magic power. `
`...In that case, there's another move. `
`Getting the Humans to split up should work." `
`"Indeed, that is probably the most effective way. `
`The smaller the number of Humans, the more the denominator shrinks. `
`As a result, the magical power functions instantaneously. `
`In other words, it all begins from one point: how to destroy this barricade situation and have them split up into small groups." `
`"However, they are already very cautious. `
`The barricade won't be destroyed easily, right...? `
`Both the barricade in Kinzo's study two games ago and the barricade in the parlor last time were very stubborn. `
`Furthermore, most of the cunning adults still remain this time." `
`"The situation is more difficult than all the ones before it, understand? `
`...If you wish, I could give you some special advice..." `
`In a closed circle, when the first murder case occurs, the survivors always hole up, `
`gathering together to observe each other and ensure their safety. `
`...Funnily enough, not only do mystery authors and murder culprits worry about how to break that situation apart, `
`but so do witches, who supposedly exist at the other end of the spectrum. `
`For a while, the new witch poked her cheek with her pointer finger, and after acting as though she was planning something, she spoke. `
`"......... `
`...No, I'm fine. `
`After all, it is a test. `
`...I won't borrow your moves." `
`"Nn, ...really...? `
`...Still, it will be rather difficult to defeat this barricade, right...?" `
`"I've already made my move. `
`I'm pretty sure it'll work. `
`And it'll definitely work on someone smart." `
`"I-Is that so...? `
`You really are excellent... `
`I'm pleased to see that my disciple won't be causing me much trouble." `
`"My motto is to study things myself before asking other people. `
`...Then, if you would excuse me. `
`I have to wait for my prey to get lured out." `
`"Indeed. `
`...Well then, handle it with care." `
`As the new witch lowered her head, her face blank, she turned into gold butterflies and vanished. `
`...Beato didn't look happy at all. `
`She seemed to be lonely because of how little she was being relied on. `
`"......Not one of them gives a fig for me. `
`......Hmm. `
`You witch apprentice, acting so smart... `
`...I'll bet she makes some painful mistake and starts crying." `
`"Then, without a doubt, she'll finally realize my greatness and beg me to teach her! `
`*cackle* Until then, I shall watch from on high." `
`She laughed loudly on the outside, but a laugh no one can hear is completely pointless. `
`Beato gave up and quickly stopped laughing. `
`...Ronove chose that time to show himself. `
`"Excuse me, Milady. `
`...The game of the second twilight with Battler-sama has ended." `
`"...Nn, I see. `
`Good work. `
`What was the result?" `
`"My sincere apologies. `
`I was forced to resign. `
`...By saying in red that 'both deaths were homicides', `
`I made Battler-sama revise his claim of 'Rosa strangled Maria to death, then died in an accident', `
`...but I could not repel his chain of moves placing Eva as the principal offender." `
`"Wasn't Eva sleeping in her room the whole time as Hideyoshi cared for her?" `
`"...He put forth the possibility that Hideyoshi was an accomplice, and that the two worked together to create an alibi." `
`"He even suspects Hideyoshi...?! `
`Couldn't you have struck back by saying in red that he was in the guest room at the time of the murder?" `
`"...I also thought of that, but multiple important pieces might have been taken several moves later. `
`...And, because this move might be connected to the new Beatrice-sama's strategy, `
`I acted out of respect to her. `
`...My apologies." `
`"Strategy, you say? `
`......Her mind does seem to be sharp. `
`...Hmph, we can let her do as she pleases. `
`It will be quite a show to see how far she can go." `
`"Pukukukuku. `
`I thought you would say that. `
`...I see that the un-cuteness of your disciple has left you in a bad mood." `
`"That's none of your business. `
`I wonder how that one plans to destroy this barricade going forward. `
`I shall keep a close eye on her. `
`......Oh, and... `
`...h-how was Battler's mood?" `
`"It appeared as though he had calmed himself down. `
`He did say that he couldn't get fired up after all, without you as his opponent." `
`"R-Really, well that's no surprise, no surprise at all! `
`If I don't return for the fourth twilight and after, Battler will probably be lonely himself...!" `
`"Pu ku ku ku... `
`And with that, if you would excuse me. `
`...I need to go bake some delicious cookies. `
`I must at least enliven the discussion between you and Battler-sama, Milady." `
`"Indeed! `
`That guy really was munching your cookies, wasn't he? `
`It's no surprise that a boy can eat so much. `
`Make a lot of them...!" `
`"Certainly. `
`I shall make enough cookies to bury the table." `
`"That sounds great...!" `
`"...What's going on? `
`What did you want to talk about...?" `
`Kyrie called Rudolf out into the corridor. `
`It was obvious that she wanted to talk about something that she didn't want the others to hear. `
`"Umm, I..." `
`"Yeah?" `
`"......I want to go outside." `
