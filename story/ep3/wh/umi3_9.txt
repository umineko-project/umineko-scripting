`...Forget what the adults expected. `
`At least for us kids, `
`these were supposed to be a fun couple of days where the cousins deepened their friendship. `
`However, when we woke up, there was an unbelievably cruel reality waiting for us... `
`"......Hic, ...hic...!" `
`"............" `
`George-aniki and Jessica were crying over Shannon-chan and Kanon-kun's deaths. `
`...Right now, everyone who was alive had gathered in the lobby on the first floor of the guesthouse. `
`And there were 12 people there. `
`...Unbelievable, right? `
`There were 18 until yesterday. `
`...And in one night, a third of that number had lost their lives... `
`I eventually sobered up from my agitation and, along with my lack of sleep from being woken up so early in the morning, `
`I was beginning to feel a faint sense of unreality. `
`...I want to think this is some kind of bad dream... `
`My cheap escapism keeps telling me that over and over. `
`Maria had gone back to sleep on the sofa Rosa was sitting in. `
`...Rather than her having nerves of steel, she probably genuinely hadn't had enough sleep. `
`The adults were holding items from what was apparently Grandfather's collection, `
`short-barrel Winchester rifles. `
`...Apparently relics from a time he'd been obsessed with Westerns, there were four guns altogether. `
`Those had been split up among the four siblings: Uncle Krauss, Aunt Eva, my dad, and Aunt Rosa. `
`Paper boxes filled with bullets lay on the table, and the siblings were silently loading them. `
`"......It's a little scary. `
`Even now, touching one of these, `
`I get the feeling Dad'll yell 'Don't touch that!' and hit me." `
`"Well, isn't that great? `
`...No matter how much you touch them, you won't be hit again." `
`"......I can't believe it. `
`...To think that Father... `
`......would meet this kind of end..." `
`"Well, I never did expect Kinzo-san to die normally in his bed, `
`...but even so, ...it is too horrible..." `
`"Hey. `
`I wonder if that really was Father...? `
`I think it might be a different person's corpse, used as a substitute to trick us..." `
`"...No, it was Father, without a doubt. `
`You saw his toes, right? `
`Generally speaking, there aren't many humans with six toes on both feet." `
`"But......that doesn't mean that such people don't exist. `
`I've heard that polydactyly isn't that rare a disease. `
`He was a man who liked large-scale tricks, right? `
`...He might have obtained a corpse from somewhere that had the same number of toes on both feet." `
`"Ridiculous. `
`Why would he do something like that...?!" `
`"...I'd agree if it was a normal person. `
`...But this is Father we're talkin' about. `
`You can't be sure Kyrie-san's talkin' nonsense." `
`"......After all, burning a corpse makes it hard to identify. `
`Still, there should be a few ways to examine him from his teeth and bone structure. `
`If the police investigated, of course they'd be able to know whose body it was right away." `
`"The problem...is that we need a telephone engineer more than the police right now." `
`"...The boats probably won't come in this typhoon. `
`...So, will they arrive tomorrow?" `
`"Most likely, the boat will come again at 9:00 tomorrow. `
`Then, I believe we will be able to contact the police." `
`"...It's the same for us... `
`and the culprit. `
`...Until the typhoon passes, this island will be closed off." `
`......Just from our parents' conversation, you could probably figure out the general gist, but let's explain the situation anyway. `
`First, early that morning. `
`In various places throughout the mansion, a total of six corpses, including Grandfather and all the servants, had been found one after another. `
`First, Grandfather had been in the boiler room, completely burnt. `
`The servants had died, each shut up in the rooms throughout the mansion that had magic circles drawn on them. `
`The cause of death for the servants was uncertain, `
`but according to Doctor Nanjo's diagnosis, there was a high likelihood that they had been stabbed by something like a spear... `
`or possibly shot with a gun. `
`That was why the adults had started arming themselves with Winchesters. `
`And what made the situation even more chaotic...was the fact that the telephones had become unusable. `
`It was unknown if lightning had caused them to break down or if the culprit had broken them. `
`At any rate, since contact with the outside had been cut off, we couldn't reach the police. `
`So until the typhoon passes and a boat comes tomorrow morning, `
`we'll have to protect ourselves. `
`After all, Rokkenjima is now isolated by the typhoon. `
`And just as we're stuck on the island, so is the culprit. `
`It seemed that the adults had stayed up all night, holding the family conference in the mansion's dining hall the whole time. `
`And yet, the crime had occurred in the mansion. `
`...So right when the adults had been in an uproar over money, `
`the murderer had been killing under the same roof... `
`They say Aunt Natsuhi's been strict about locking the doors and windows at the night. `
`And yet, some suspicious person had entered and left the mansion. `
`...The adults had decided that the inside of the mansion was too large to be safe, `
`so they had pulled out the guns and moved to the guesthouse, where we had been. `
`......Which brings us to the present. `
`George-aniki had begged to see Shannon-chan's corpse, `
`but the adults had refused, saying that he mustn't do so until the police arrived. `
`That wasn't just because they wanted to seal all the rooms to preserve the scene. `
`...After all, the culprit who had killed six people was wandering about the mansion. `
`To the Ushiromiya family right now, the mansion that should've been their home... `
`was now a danger zone that an unknown murderer could enter and leave at will... `
`After all, it's a huge mansion. `
`There are plenty of blind spots and dark places, and it's too vast to guarantee absolute safety with this number of people. `
`Relatively speaking, the guesthouse was much smaller. `
`It had two above-ground stories. `
`Something like 10 or so rooms? `
`...Apparently, it had originally been constructed to serve as a small hotel, as part of the plan to turn this island into a resort. `
`So, it was easier to know what was going on everywhere inside it, and it'd be easier to keep safe. `
`It made for a good place to hole up in. `
`...Also... `
`...It was extremely likely that this mass murder of six people was a 'game'. `
`After all, the culprit had proclaimed so in a letter. `
`I heard that a Western-style envelope with the family crest, just like the one Maria claimed to have received from Beatrice yesterday, `
`had been found in the boiler room where Grandfather's corpse had been discovered. `
`This was what the letter said. `
`So that there will be no misunderstandings... `
`The game I seek is for everyone to try and solve the riddle of the epitaph, `
`not for you to try and catch me. `
`If you don’t solve the riddle, the pitiful sacrifices will further increase in number. `
`It would be wiser to spend your time solving the epitaph, instead of searching for me. `
`If no one can solve the riddle, no one will survive. `
`If a person appears who can miraculously solve it, I will give them all the gold of the Golden Land, `
`the Ushiromiya Family Headship, and all of my power. `
`I was the one who succeeded the Ushiromiya Family Headship after Kinzo-sama. `
`I look forward to seeing who will succeed to that headship after me. `
`——The Golden Witch, Beatrice. `
`...This riddle of the epitaph was...that thing. `
`That strange epitaph written by the portrait of the witch on display in the hall of the mansion. `
`Grandfather was the one who had it written, `
`and the person who solved it would, supposedly, be given the inheritance or the hidden gold or something like that. `
`Ever since it was first put on display there several years ago, `
`the relatives had secretly tried to solve that riddle, despite saying on the surface that the whole idea was silly. `
`However, up until today, no one had solved it. `
`We were once again being urged to solve that unintelligible riddle, and this time, we were faced with the threat that we'd all be killed if we didn't solve it. `
`...If that wasn't a 'game', what else could it be...? `
`The bold opinion that we should search the premises for the culprit did come up once. `
`However, there was a good chance they were armed, and there might not be just one of them. `
`And, ...while they might have been able to kill more than six people, they had {i:stopped at 6}. `
`The opinion that won out in the end...was that we should avoid needlessly antagonizing the culprit, `
`and hole up in a safe place while we waited for the police to arrive... `
`After the adults carefully checked that the doors and windows in the guesthouse were locked, they set up camp in the lobby. `
`As they loaded their guns to distract themselves from the tension, `
`their expressions showed that they were already fatigued from this long day, which had still barely begun... `
`There was nothing for me to do. `
`Now, all I could do was be taught how to use a gun, `
`to prepare for the off-chance of something happening that {i:led to an excess of guns}... `
`...That's fine. `
`Just obediently stay there, {i:me and the rest of you}. `
`"......Six people in the beginning again. `
`And this time it's Grandfather and all of the servants put together." `
`"Most likely, `
`that child has carefully studied your moves from the last game... `
`and has made an optimal move by taking the pieces you were most likely to suspect from the start." `
`"...That makes sense. `
`...That was true both last time and the time before that. `
`The servants, who know everything about the mansion and who walk around with keys, always fall into the most suspicious category of people." `
`"...A good example in the last game would be Jessica's closed room. `
`If I'd only accepted that a servant was the culprit, that wouldn't even have been a closed room." `
`"And so, `
`...that child went straight for them, `
`probably to block off a method of escape you'd be likely to attempt sooner or later." `
`"Beato already proclaimed in red that there are no more than 18 people on this island. `
`...In other words,... `
`{i:it's time to give up on that}. `
`...Now I've got to suspect one of the 18." `
`"...That child will probably come at you by stealing the pieces for all the 18, ...while also making an appearance as a 19th person who shouldn't exist, `
`for then you would be forced to accept that your opponent is a witch. `
`...After all, now that the intimidation approach has failed, trying to force you to surrender by showing you magic, `
`the only remaining option is a frontal attack." `
`"...Perfect. `
`Bluffing won't work anymore." `
`"Be careful. `
`Deception is what witches are best at. `
`...No matter what your opponent says or shows you, `
`it will not be able to threaten the truth that you believe in. `
`Don't forget that." `
`"......Sure. `
`As if I'd fall for the same moves over and over. `
`......Come on out, Beatrice. `
`Let's get started!!!" `
`"I am already seated at the table of the contest. `
`And my turn is already complete." `
`"...To think we would end up having Madam as our foe. `
`This will not be easy, Milady. `
`...Our moves will be read thoroughly." `
`"I care not. `
`By now, Teacher's moves are all old-fashioned classics. `
`There is nothing to fear." `
`"...So, just what moves can you make beyond the classics I taught you? `
`I look forward to seeing, Beatrice." `
`"...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* `
`You okay with this, Battleer? `
`Can someone who denies witches really accept a witch as a strategist...?" `
`"Your stupid provocation is pointless. `
`This is my advisor...no, my second. `
`That doesn't change one bit...that this is a fistfight between you and me." `
`"I understand. `
`...One as wobbly as yourself probably needs training wheels on his bicycle. `
`Do as you like. `
`Come, let us begin!! `
`It's your turn!" `
`"Let's begin with the reconstruction of the crime scene. `
`...Virgilia, quickly please!" `
`"The first corpse discovered was Shannon's. `
`She was found in the parlor on the first floor of the mansion. `
`The door and windows were locked, and a closed room was established." `
`"...Beato, I need some details. `
`Let's reconfirm the definition of a closed room." `
`"Indeed. `
`The term 'closed room' refers to a room where the inside and the outside are completely cut off from each other. `
`Naturally, it will be impossible to even affect things across that boundary line, much less enter or escape across it. `
`This includes an all-inclusive denial of the existence of hidden doors, as well as all possibility of intervention from the outside. `
`...Henceforth, this shall be referred to as... `
`'Beatrice's Closed Room Definition'!" `
`"Let's focus in a bit. `
`...How do you define 'all possibility of intervention from the outside'?" `
`"I refer to all types of direct intervention from the outside, such as using a fishing line or a long, thin rod. `
`In conclusion, there are no gaps in the doors and windows through which such tricks will work." `
`"I wonder about that. `
`Even if there wasn't a gap, you should be able to interfere with radio waves, like with a remote control, right?" `
`"Very well. `
`I'll add to this definition that interference due to radio waves and related methods of remote control shall be impossible." `
`"There's also an extension telephone in the parlor. `
`A device connected to that wouldn't count as remote control, right?!" `
`"The phones are already unusable, are they not? `
`...Ah, whatever. `
`I'll include that too. `
`All direct and indirect methods of interfering with the inside of the closed room from the outside of the room are impossible." `
`"What about a voice or a knock? `
`Those should be able to interfere from the outside without someone entering the room, right?" `
`"......Even though it's a closed room, it probably isn't impossible for someone to knock or call out. `
`The closed room definition does not cover whether transmission of intent across the boundary is possible or not." `
`"In other words, you can't make it so your definition includes the blockage of all methods of communication with the outside?" `
`"That is indeed the case." `
`"Understood. `
`......So, Shannon-chan's parlor satisfies Beatrice's Closed Room Definition, right?" `
`"Correct." `
`"......Closed Room Definition, understood. `
`Continue, Virgilia." `
`"Yes. `
`......Shannon's corpse was in possession of one master key. `
`The relatives who discovered her collected this." `
`"Beato, repeat it. `
`How many master keys this time?" `
`"...Hmph. The same as last time. `
`{p:1:There are five, one for each servant}." `
`"Which means this still isn't a closed room. `
`There are still four master keys left. `
`It just means that after Shannon-chan was murdered, one of the other four keys locked it." `
`"Correct. `
`......And, it wasn't only a master key that was found." `
`"Yes. `
`...Alongside the corpse, there was a Western envelope with the family crest. `
`Instead of a letter, the key to a guest room on the second floor was inside it." `
`"...The key to a second floor guest room... `
`The only key other than the master key that can open the door to that second floor guest room. Is that definition correct?" `
`"Indeed. There is no problem. `
`And, unlike the master keys, only one of those exists." `
`"In other words, apart from the five master keys, `
`there will be only one key that can unlock certain rooms." `
`"...In other words, this is a message telling them to go to the second floor guest room next? `
`So the adults moved to the second floor guest room, right?" `
`"Yes. `
`The door to the second floor guest room was locked, and a magic circle was drawn on it. `
`...The relatives unlocked it with the key they had found near Shannon's corpse. `
`Inside, Kumasawa's corpse was discovered. `
`It was a closed room. `
`One that satisfied Beatrice's Closed Room Definition." `
`"......Kumasawa was in possession of one master key. `
`The relatives collected this. `
`And like in Shannon's case, there was a Western envelope discovered alongside her. `
`Inside was the key to the third floor waiting room. `
`The relatives moved to the third floor waiting room." `
`"So, there was a magic circle on the door to the third floor waiting room, and that door was locked?" `
`"Yes. `
`Inside the room, Gohda's corpse was discovered. `
`The room was a closed room. `
`One that satisfied Beatrice's Closed Room Definition." `
`"......Gohda was in possession of one master key. `
`The relatives collected this. `
`And like up until now, a Western envelope with the family seal was discovered, `
`inside of which was the key to the second floor VIP room. `
`The relatives moved to the second floor VIP room." `
`"......What's going on here...? `
`What are you planning...?" `
`"*cackle*cackle* `
`There's no need to glare, is there? `
`It may be a closed room, but there are still multiple master keys that can open it, correct? `
`And besides the master keys, I've even given you keys specific to each room." `
`"...I don't like where this is going. `
`...But I'm starting to see how it'll turn out. `
`So it continues like this for all six people?" `
`"Yes, that is correct. `
`Inside the second floor VIP room, Genji's corpse was discovered. `
`One master key was collected. `
`The key to the underground boiler room was discovered. `
`They moved to the underground boiler room. `
`Inside the underground boiler room, Kinzo's corpse was discovered. `
`The key to the chapel was discovered. `
`They moved to the chapel. `
`Inside the chapel, Kanon's corpse was discovered. `
`One master key was collected. `
`The key to the first floor parlor was discovered. `
`...With this, our reconstruction of how all six corpses were discovered is complete." `
`"An addendum. `
`Along with the key to the chapel, a letter was enclosed in the Western envelope found near Kinzo's corpse. `
`The contents of the letter were as you saw. `
`It further urged the relatives to solve the riddle of the epitaph." `
`"......In that case, `
`...what's going on? `
`If the last place, where Kanon was, had the key to the very first room, the parlor, where Shannon was... `
`That makes six closed rooms, all tied together, right?" `
`"That is correct! `
`The six closed rooms are all tied together. `
`The keys to unlock each one are all shut up inside the next room." `
`"In other words, the six closed rooms form one massive closed room, `
`and all of the master keys as well as the individual room keys are shut up inside it...!" `
`" `
`{p:1:Furthermore, all of the doors and windows in the six rooms are normal}. `
`{p:1:No device exists which can lock them without a key, such as an auto‐lock}. `
`*cackle*cackle* What do you think? It's beautiful, isn't iiiiiiiiiiiit??? Uhhyahhyahhyaaahh!" `
`"Once again, Milady, that is not dignified." `
`When Ronove rebuked her, Beato stuck her tongue at him without showing any signs of shame. `
`"Uhihihi, sorry, sorry. `
`Playing with Battler just put me into such a good mood. `
`*cackle* So, Battleer? `
`What do you think of my move? `
`If you can't think of anything in particular, I wouldn't mind showing you how I made the goats carry the corpses... `
`and seal all of the rooms with magic, okaaaaay?" `
`"Do what you want. `
`I'll listen respectfully to this 'magic theory' that you claim is true. `
`However, I can claim my 'human theory', `
`even though it's completely different from yours, without any interference from your claim." `
`"In other words, `
`there's no need for me to pay attention to your bullshit!! `
`Go ahead and show me how you can lock the door with your multi-colored magic simply by waving your magic staff. `
`Just like those guys with their toad oil and all-purpose kitchen knives!" `
`"Virgilia, let's reconstruct the crime scene! `
`Search for a weakness!! `
`Were they all definitely dead? `
`If one of them is just playing dead, this isn't a closed room at all!" `
`"Nanjo confirmed that all of them were dead. `
`However, due to the 'Devil's Proof', it is impossible to deny the possibility of a wrong diagnosis. `
`...In other words, that child cannot make the likelihood that Nanjo overlooked them being alive equal to zero." `
`"Here it is, that 'Devil's Proof'. `
`But there exists a sword that can carve that up...!" `
`"Wh-What's up with them? `
`...Looks like they're having a good time, leaving me out of the discussion. `
`I'm his opponent, am I not...? `
`Doesn't he have any time to spare for me...?" `
`"Fundamentally speaking, communication with one's opponent is not necessary to the act of competing in chess. `
`...Every time you've communicated with him outside of making your moves, you've used that opportunity to confuse him. `
`...Perhaps this is the result of him not wanting to be led astray." `
`"......Nngg. `
`...For some reason, I don't like it." `
`"You are challenging him to a chess match, are you not?" `
`"That's true, but... `
`...gah!" `
`Beatrice puffed out her cheeks, as though to say 'I don't know why, but I don't like it!' `
`"Because the police have not yet arrived at the crime scene, the human side's ability to inspect the scene is limited. `
`For a strict confirmation of death, I recommend that you have that child repeat it in red." `
`"Okay, that's where I'll strike, repeat it!! `
`"‘The six victims are all dead’!!" `
`"...Milady, he has told you to repeat something in red, has he not?" `
`"Hey, enough lazing around!! `
`Do you refuse to repeat it?! `
`This is where our battle starts!!" `
`"Wha?! `
`Owowowowoow!! `
`*cackle*cackle* Sorry, sorry, that's fine, I'll answer." `
`" `
`{p:1:Kinzo, Genji, Shannon, Kanon, Gohda, and Kumasawa—these six are all dead}!" `
`"Why are you so out of it? `
`...Okay. `
`So I've already got one out of you. `
`We'll start by denying that classic trick where the victims are playing dead." `
`"*cackle*! `
`I won't go easy on you anymore! Come at me how you like. `
`I'll slice them slantwise one after another!" `
`"Then repeat this! `
`No one is hiding in any of the six rooms! `
`Let's see you deny the existence of people we aren't aware of!" `
`"I'll answer. `
`" `
`{p:1:There is no one hiding in the six rooms}!" `
`"Okay. `
`Now I'm sure it's only the six of them in the can. `
`And they aren't pretending to be dead." `
`"...What will you do, what will you dooo? `
`As if a human could manage anything by now. `
`Obediently kneel to the fact that I can control locks at will with my wonderful magic, okaaaaaay?" `
`"Quit babbling. `
`Repeat this too. `
`'The six deaths were instant deaths'!" `
`"Instant deeeeeeaths? `
`Hoh, what do you mean by that?" `
`"...It means there's a possibility that a single victim on the verge of death managed to escape into the room, `
`and after locking it from the inside to create a closed room, they passed away." `
`"...Hmph. `
`A classic closed room murder trick. `
`One requiring that the victim receive a fatal wound...and then die later. `
`It is possible for a closed room to be constructed unexpectedly if the victim holes up inside the room to escape the murderer... `
`and then dies after locking the door." `
`"In order to deny that possibility, `
`you will need to proclaim that 'The six died instantly' with the red truth." `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`Very well, very well, I'll slay you with my red treasured sword! `
`" `
`{p:1:The six died instantly}! `
`By 'died instantly', I mean the targets instantly became incapable of action after being attacked." `
`"Well, it might still have taken them several seconds or minutes to die in the complete sense of the word. `
`But regardless, it was completely impossible for them to take any actions of their own will. `
`In that sense, I can confirm that they suffered instant deaths!" `
`"...Up until this point, I've just been checking for the classic tricks. `
`Now's when our showdown over the closed rooms really starts, okay...? `
`If the culprit isn't on the inside, they're on the outside. `
`So they somehow killed from outside the rooms." `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`Have you lost your mind? `
`After all, 'a closed room = murder is impossible from the outside', right?! `
`That's why only a magical murder would be possible!" `
`"No, that's wrong. `
`The right approach is 'a murder really happened = it isn't a closed room'! `
`No matter how much you try to trick me, this definitely isn't a closed room! `
`It's a sham that only looks like one!" `
`"However, Battler-sama, `
`{p:1:Only the victims are inside the rooms,} `
`{p:1:and no other people exist inside the rooms}. `
`And by Milady's Closed Room Definition, `
`remote murders from outside the room have been clearly denied, have they not?" `
`"Wait. `
`The definition of remote murders is pretty broad, right? `
`It's not just about pulling a fishing line from outside the room `
`and strangling the victim inside the room. `
`For example, ... `
`a trap would make for an excellent remote murder!" `
`"A traap? `
`Hoh, and what might that be?!" `
`"Just as an example, let's say they were instructed to enter rooms that someone had picked out beforehand... `
`and lock the doors from the inside to create the closed rooms themselves. `
`A trap was set up in those rooms that they didn't know about... `
`and that's what killed them. `
`...How's that?! That doesn't contradict anything!" `
`"...There are no problems. `
`It corresponds to the existing state." `
`"...There are no problems on our side either. `
`It does not conflict with Milady's Closed Room Definition." `
`"Kuhhahhahahahahahahahaha?! `
`What's with that stupid reasoning?! `
`Nothing suspicious was found in any of the rooms, right? `
`What form did that trap have?! `
`Where was it hidden and how did it operate?! `
`Explain that for all six of them...in the parlor, the guest room, the waiting room, the VIP room, the boiler room, and the chapel. `
`Well? You can't, can you?!?!" `
`"Decline refutation!! `
`There is no need for me to explain that!! `
`And even so, it doesn't damage my claim!!" `
`"Wh-What did you saaaaaaaaayy...?!?!" `
`"Beatrice, it's a 'Devil's Proof'. `
`The fact that he cannot explain the nature of the trap... `
`does not in itself deny the existence of such a trap!" `
`"......Well done. `
`While overbearing, a wonderful move." `
`"...Nng!!! `
`This guy's getting completely used to this...!!" `
`"Check. `
`Due to murder trap X that we couldn't find, it'd be possible to establish this closed room murder." `
`"...I-I'll kill that check with the red truth!! `
`" `
`{p:1:The six were not killed by traps}!" `
`"And the definition of a trap?!" `
`"Oh, `
`...umm, `
`...that's it! `
`Something that activates when a victim triggers it on their own. `
`Oh, ...and that's not all! `
`It also includes things activated by remote control or by a timer, `
`...everything of that sort!" `
`"Pu ku ku... `
`So, it refers to all arrangements that could carry out a murder without the direct participation of the one who planned it out. `
`Perhaps we might sum it up that way." `
`"H-How's that?! `
`I've struck back!! `
`As if I'd let a human crush this closed room!!" `
`"...... `
`......You're looking pretty frantic to win too." `
`"...Whaat...?! `
`What do you mean...?" `
`"...You're frantically fighting to make me accept your existence. `
`Until now, I thought I was just being toyed around with by you one-sidedly." `
`"...But that's not actually true. `
`You're also frantically resisting my counters, fighting to show that you exist...! `
`Now, `
`...I finally really feel that it's true." `
`This isn't torture inflicted on me, over whether I'll surrender or not. `
`"This is a fight between you and me on an even footing!!" `
`...Okay, now it's starting to get interesting, isn't it? `
`All six died in closed rooms, and no outsiders were inside. `
`And there was no meddling from the outside, and also no traps. `
`Up until now, I'd probably start suspecting that this had to be the work of magic." `
`"...And if you decided to show off some bizarre magic at this moment, I might even have surrendered. `
`......It's that favorite strategy of yours. `
`...You intercept all my moves, and in the moment I've exhausted all options and fallen to my knees, `
`when my heart's barriers are at their weakest, you show off some strange magic and take the game all at once!!" `
`"......That short temper is something this child has always had, `
`along with a bad habit of rushing things when victory is in sight." `
`"Pu ku ku. `
`After all, Milady cannot stand putting off a match." `
`"Heeey, shut up, shut up!! `
`It's Battler's turn, right?! `
`I finished off that 'trap piece' you advanced! `
`What should I repeat next? `
`Show me what you've got!!" `
`"Right!! `
`Now that even traps have been defeated, this looks like a perfect closed room murder at a glance. `
`...And that's why I'll spin the chessboard around right now!!" `
`"...Here it comes, that special technique of yours! `
`How exactly are you going to spin what around?! `
`Try showing meeeeeeeeeeee!!" `
`"Yeah, I'll show you!! `
`I don't need to think of how six people could be killed inside closed rooms from the outside! `
`Aaah, it's useless, it's useless, it's all useless! `
`That's right, the question isn't how you can kill from outside the rooms. `
`The point is how they died inside the rooms, making them closed rooms!" `
`"...That's it, this is the answer!! `
`If you assume that one of the six victims was the culprit, `
`this closed room can be explained extremely easily!" `
`"Wh-Whaaaaaaat?! `
`Ridiculous! `
`I believe I clearly said in red that the six of them were dead...!!" `
`"Oh, there were six deaths. `
`Five were victims who got killed. `
`But if you assume that the other person committed suicide, you can destroy this closed room!!" `
`"...Certainly. `
`If the culprit locked themselves in the final closed room... `
`and threw away their own life, this closed room chain would be established." `
`"The suicide of the culprit. `
`...Normally, it would be an unthinkable move, `
`but the argument that the unthinkable cannot exist... `
`cannot be used. `
`...And he has no responsibility to demonstrate a motive. `
`A truly powerful move, which can only be used in a chess match against a witch...!" `
`"...Well, one cannot be certain that there was no motive. `
`...For example, it has been announced that Kinzo only had a short time left to live. `
`Perhaps he did not regret losing his short remaining life and used his own death to send a message. `
`...It might be possible to attach such a motive. `
`......Milady, `
`it is our turn." `
`"I-Indeed! `
`To think you'd trample even the dignity of the dead to create a culprit...! `
`What a heartless, cold-blooded man...!" `
`"I'll set up the dead as the culprit. `
`...This worse than inhuman move...is one you used to attack Kanon-kun in the last game. `
`...Even though the games are different, I'm taking a shot back at you with this move, `
`as a tribute to Kanon-kun for that time." `
`"Just now, I've freed that Kanon-kun from his regrets!!" `
`"Nng... Gaaaaahhhh...!!" `
`"You have no responsibility to hold back here. `
`You should try to confirm that suicide wasn't the cause of any of their deaths. `
`I recommend that you have that child repeat it in red." `
`"Right!! `
`But suicide's a naive word that won't corner her!! `
`Beato, this'll stop you!! `
`"Repetition requested!! `
`"The six deaths were all homicides"!!" `
`".........That...is painful." `
`"Uguu...!! `
`............Nngg, ooohh...!" `
`"Hmmmm? `
`What's wrong, all six of them were killed, right?! `
`I'm just confirming that simple premise we've had from the very beginning, right? `
`Can't you repeat it?!" `
`"Hmph, ...I refuse to repeat it. `
`...Th-There's no reason in particular." `
`"You realize that refusing to repeat this part is the same as resigning, right?!" `
`"Checkmate!! `
`One of the six was the culprit, and they planned to commit suicide after constructing the closed room! `
`That's all!!" `
`"...W-Wait! `
`No, umm, ...I'll say it, I'll say it! `
`I'll use the red like you want! `
`{p:1:None of the six committed suicide}!" `
`How's that?! `
`Are you satisfied...?! `
`*cackle*cackle*, kakkakakakaka! `
`I've struck back, I've struck back!!!" `
`"Tch, `
`...what the hell, so you can say it... `
`...But that's strange. `
`Why are you so panicky...?" `
`"...I-I-It's your imagination. `
`This time, even I'm feeling the pressure. `
`That's right, I don't have any leeway. `
`Pay it no mind..." `
`"...The line you asked that child to repeat has been altered. `
`Do not be fooled." `
`".........Gaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh..." `
`"Pu ku ku ku... `
`It seems not to have worked, Milady." `
`"Th-That's right! `
`She didn't say 'the six deaths were all homicides'. `
`She changed it to 'none of the six committed suicide'! `
`Which means one of them wasn't killed by someone else and didn't commit suicide. `
`......Aaaaaaaahhh, `
`I've got it, I've got it!! `
`This is the truth!" `
`"Culprit X, who was hiding among the 6, murdered the other 5 and then set up a closed room. `
`...After that, they planned to escape from or hide in that room by some method." `
`"However, {i:they got in an accident}!! `
`The culprit died from an accident that even they hadn't expected, setting up a closed room murder that even they hadn't desired!! `
`Now it's over, Beatrice!! `
`Checkmate!!!" `
`"...D-Damn iiiit!! `
`Did you think I'd be cornered by something like that?!! `
`I'd never announce my resignation over something like that!! `
`I'll slice up that foolish checkmate with my red treasured sword over and over again!! `
`None of the six died an accidental-" `
`"...Muga?! `
`Mmmmnn, mmwt mwar muu mmnnmmng, mmmpphhh!" `
`"My apologies. `
`We request some time to strategize. `
`Please allow us a brief postponement on this matter." `
`"...It's a fair request. `
`Perhaps you should accept it." `
`"Sure!! Take a break! `
`I've been given those a lot lately. `
`Now it's your turn to take one...!!" `
`"Thank you very much. `
`Come, Milady, ...this way. `
`And let us quietly count to one hundred inside our heads." `
`"Mmmmmmmphphh!! `
`Mphphpmhmmmm, mmmppmmphhhh!! `
`Mmmmmm!" `
`Ronove quickly covered Beato's mouth with his hand as she grew thoroughly panicked and agitated, suspending the game. `
`He pulled Beato away, supposedly to hold a strategy conference... `
`"...Damn. `
`That demon butler. `
`When Beato got all hot, I had a perfect chance to corner her..." `
`Beato normally acted like she was graceful and above it all, but she actually had a really short temper and got mad easily. `
`...Her usual intellect had less of a voice when she got excited. `
`"Ronove certainly is thinking clearly. `
`...He probably gave your opponent some time to cool down. `
`...That child grew too stubborn trying to remove your check... `
`and was about to easily let several large pieces go. `
`...After all, the first twilight is only a skirmish. `
`...The correct move at that time would have been to withdraw." `
`"...So, what does it mean? `
`Did I reach checkmate, or didn't I?" `
`"That child was about to say something in red. `
`You probably wouldn't have reached checkmate yet. `
`...But, most likely, `
`you can expect our opponents to resign once they've cooled their heads." `
`"...You're joking. `
`Even though she hates losing that much...?" `
`"Yes. `
`In a losing battle, it is essential to withdraw your troops as soon as possible to try and minimize your losses. `
`...The difficult part is gauging whether it's a losing battle or not. `
`...Your opponent's butler seems to have calmly made that decision." `
`"...Oh well. `
`In other words, she managed to escape by a hair's breadth. `
`......Looks like... `
`...Getting checkmate and delivering the final blow won't be that easy for me." `
`"However, you should count this as your victory. `
`It seems they barely managed to prevent a large loss, `
`but they certainly sustained considerable damage. `
`...The scale of that child's panic ought to make the depths of that wound quite clear to you." `
`"Seriously. `
`Ihihihi, it feels like she'd start crying if I bullied her any more." `
`As we talked, Ronove returned with Beato, who wore a meek expression. `
`...She didn't yet have her usual bold smile, but it looked like the blood wasn't rushing to her head anymore. `
`"......Hey. `
`It's your turn. `
`Did you decide on your next move?" `
`"I resign. `
`...For now, I will let you have your victory." `
`Beato told me that frankly. `
`It seemed she'd taken a far-sighted view, as though saying 'If you want to laugh, then laugh'. `
`...It was a bit of a killjoy, and I lost my desire to deliver the final blow. `
`"Well, now that you've resigned, `
`that just means we're even, since my theory and yours can't deny each other. `
`You should treat it more like a tie than a loss." `
`"...I don't need your disgusting sympathy. `
`I'm telling you that I lost this round. `
`...When you find a dog drenched with rain, do you have a sudden urge to whack it with a stick or something?" `
`"Nope. `
`I'm not you." `
`"............" `
`Even though she ridiculed me horribly when I showed signs of defeat, this is the best she's got when the tables are turned. `
`I did feel that was pretty cowardly of her, but I decided to act with dignity as the victor and let it slide. `
`...Beato resigned. `
`That's the one result of the first twilight. `
`Beatrice couldn't counter my move of 'one of the six was the culprit, `
`and that person died in an accident'. `
`...No, she probably could've countered it, but for some strategic reason, she admitted defeat. `
`It felt less like I'd won...and more like I'd let her slip away at the last second... `
`In a chess match with a witch, battles can be fought solely with pieces known as X, which require no detailed explanations. `
`Thanks to the 'Devil's Proof', I could create as many strange fictions as I wanted and use them as fighters in our argument. `
`...But that only works in a chess match with a witch. `
`...In our human world, you can't use such abstract theories to explain things. `
`This first twilight was a chain of six closed rooms. `
`...It certainly may have been possible for a human. `
`Beato wasn't able to deny all possibilities. `
`However, I don't have a clue who committed the crime, `
`or why, or how they actually did it... `
`It may seem strange to hear me saying this after I won... `
`...But for some reason, I felt like I'd have been more satisfied `
`if Beatrice had been able to say definitively that it was impossible for humans. `
`I managed to avoid specifics using an abstract piece called X... `
`......But I couldn't deny the sense that some eerie intent that must never be known... `
`was filling up this entire mansion... `
