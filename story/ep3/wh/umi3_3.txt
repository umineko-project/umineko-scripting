`Without even being allowed to wait for dessert, we were chased out of the room. `
`I heard that, in the end, our parents were unable to get Grandfather to respond. `
`...Well, I hate to say it, but I feel like giving Grandfather a high five right now. `
`He was probably pretty satisfied with how his strange letter had given his children a good shock, since they'd all been so infatuated with the inheritance problem while Grandfather was still alive. `
`I also felt like our despicable parents had gotten what they deserved in all of this confusion. `
`...But I couldn't really say that I was feeling great. `
`I felt all sulky. `
`Apparently, Grandfather hadn't seemed concerned with the whole thing, but he also hadn't denied anything about the letter either. `
`When talking about the witch's letter, Grandfather's name kept popping up. `
`If Grandfather knew that someone was stealing his name, then considering his character, he'd probably be mad with rage. `
`But even though Grandfather now knew the contents of that letter, he coldly ignored it. `
`So, did that count as a silent yes? `
`Aunt Eva and Dad were trying to interpret the letter in their favor, their greed clearly visible. `
`It wouldn't have mattered so much if that was all, but the adults had now started focusing on Maria, who had received the letter. `
`They kept pounding her with questions about who had given it to her. `
`Maria repeated over and over again that she had gotten it from Beatrice, but there was no way such a mysterious person could've sneaked onto the island. `
`...After all, this island's small, and there's no one living on it outside the Ushiromiya family household. `
`Maria kept repeating that she'd gotten it from Beatrice no matter how many times she was asked. `
`The adults seemed to think she was trying to trick them, so they didn't hold back and questioned her until she broke out in tears... `
`When Maria was released, she sobbed, all worn out from crying. `
`After our parents ordered us to go to the guesthouse and take Maria with us, `
`they shut themselves up in the dining hall and started getting louder and louder as they discussed the inheritance. `
`It seemed that, because of that strange letter, Uncle Krauss's chances of becoming the next Head might've been reduced to a blank slate, `
`and in exchange for accepting him, my dad and the rest were trying to swindle Uncle Krauss out of a lot of money...or something like that. `
`Disgusted as we were, Jessica and I were happy to move over to the guesthouse. `
`We didn't want to be under the same roof as those filthy adults, their heads so filled with thoughts about money. `
`George-aniki pleaded on our parents' behalf, saying that he wanted us to understand them. `
`...I understood his reasoning. `
`No matter how filthy this talk of money was, it wouldn't go away if you just closed your eyes to it. `
`But even so, how could they sink so low as to overtly fight over the money of the dead...? `
`Maria had cried herself dry and was hiding in her bed. `
`She hadn't even twitched for a while, so she was probably sleeping... `
`"......Who in the world gave that letter to Maria-chan?" `
`"George nii-san, `
`you can't ask her that anymore. `
`Isn't it fine to say that Maria got it from Beatrice and leave it at that...?" `
`"After all, we don't want to make her cry any more than this." `
`...Even though we said that, `
`we couldn't clear away a gloomy feeling. `
`"There are only 18 people on this island now. `
`The thought that, somewhere in the rain, a 19th person gave Maria-chan that letter and is now hiding somewhere... `
`doesn't seem realistic at all." `
`"Most likely, ...somebody got Shannon or someone to put on the dress from that portrait...and cleverly got Maria to go along with their story." `
`"...Though, in Maria's case, just seeing the dress would probably convince her that it really was Beatrice." `
`"Maybe it doesn't really matter who handed her the letter. `
`The important thing is who sent it. `
`...The point is that Grandfather wanted to cause an uproar by assuming the name of the witch. `
`Seriously, that old geezer's good at riling people up." `
`The most likely answer is that our occult-loving Grandfather was playing around, `
`handing the letter over to Maria, who shares the same hobby as he does, in such a dramatic way. `
`...Though, he failed to give any thought for what Maria would have to go through, making it a pretty shitty thing to do... `
`"Seriously. Messing around with Maria's pure heart... `
`It doesn't matter who handed the letter over. `
`Maria says she got it from Beatrice, so let's treat it that way." `
`"I agree. `
`Let's do that. `
`To Maria-chan, Beatrice is kind of like what Santa Claus is to most kids." `
`"Whether we're dealing with some nonexistent 19th person or Santa Claus, `
`as long as we all acknowledge them, they'll at least "exist" inside Maria. `
`...I see, guess it can be important to lie to a child to protect their dreams." `
`"......Hmm? `
`What's up, Jessica? `
`Are you still angry?" `
`Jessica had her hand on her chin, as though there was something that she just couldn't understand. `
`When I called out to her, she came to her senses. `
`"Aah, ...sorry. `
`Well, ...actually, `
`...I was wondering if Maria might've actually met Beatrice." `
`"...What do you mean by that? `
`Are you saying there's a 19th person on this island?" `
`"If you truly take Maria-chan's words to heart, then you would arrive at that answer." `
`"No, that's not what I mean. `
`...I'm talking about the story that someone we don't know has been living on this island since long ago." `
`"Living, you say? Where?" `
`"...In the forest." `
`The adults were gathered in the dining hall, spending a very long time continuing the discussion that had been started by Beatrice's letter... `
`Krauss strongly claimed that the letter was a simple prank, `
`but he couldn't overturn the claim that Kinzo's failure to deny the letter was answer enough. `
`Judging by Kinzo's character, if he knew that a letter had been written in his name, he would be mad with rage. `
`Since all of the siblings knew that, Krauss had no choice but to withdraw his claim. `
`Without even having to summarize it, the contents of the letter were simple. `
`The person who could solve the witch's epitaph would receive the Headship and assets. `
`This did a lot of damage to Krauss, who had been sure that he would receive the Headship, `
`and was better news than the rest of them, who had already given up, could have hoped for. `
`However, there were some points that worried them. `
`"The person who solved the epitaph" was not limited to a member of the Ushiromiya family. `
`Taken literally, anyone, no matter how doubtful their origin, might receive the Headship. `
`And furthermore, this meant there was a chance that all of the Ushiromiya family's assets would be stolen by some unknown person. `
`In that sense, it was definitely not a situation where even the other siblings could afford to lower their guard. `
`Had this letter come from an assassin sent by Kinzo, calling themselves Beatrice? `
`...Or was this the scheme of some unknown person trying to steal the Ushiromiya family's wealth? `
`They still didn't know the truth. `
`...But they could say one thing for certain. `
`Maria had received this problematic letter... `
`received this problematic letter... `
`today, on this island. `
`In other words, someone planning something to do with that letter was on this island today. `
`...Had it been set up by Kinzo, one of the four siblings, `
`or maybe some unknown person? `
`No matter how much they suspected each other, they couldn't reach a conclusion. `
`After getting tired of bickering with each other, `
`they finally reached the extremely obvious conclusion that doubting each other was just a waste of time... `
`"...We've made no progress. `
`We've just been spinning our wheels." `
`"That's right. `
`And the mere fact that you've realized it means we won't have to waste any more time." `
`"It is not certain that Father sent the letter. `
`My husband is merely exasperated by your inability to hold a conversation." `
`"Who's unable to hold a conversation? `
`You keep yelling at me every time I say something. `
`Do you truly think that such shameful behavior is fitting for a member of the Ushiromiya family?" `
`"Would you give it a rest, Eva? `
`You too, Natsuhi-san. `
`That topic's finished for now." `
`"Sh-Shall we all cool our heads off for now? `
`Let's have some cool drinks brought over." `
`"That sounds good. `
`It would probably be wiser if we cooled our heads. `
`Don't you want to take a short break too, dear?" `
`"...Aneki looks like she's in a bad mood, `
`so I'll pass on that break. `
`But I agree about the cool drinks. `
`Rosa, have someone bring some water. `
`A whole pitcher." `
`"Yes, understood..." `
`Rosa headed over to the extension telephone in a corner of the room and called the servant room. `
`She then passed on what Rudolf had told her to the person on the other end. `
`The vicious bickering up until now vanished as though it had been a lie. `
`That silence continued until Gohda finished setting the table and retreated from the room... `
`"......Is there anything else that you require?" `
`"No. `
`Please leave us." `
`"Yes. `
`...Then if you will excuse me. `
`If you need anything, call me at any time." `
`After listening to the sound of Gohda's footsteps disappear off into the distance, everyone took a deep breath at the same time to break the tension. `
`"...It sure is raining hard. `
`I wonder if this 19th person is taking shelter in the rose garden arbor about now." `
`"I-I wonder. `
`...They might be able to escape the rain there, but it would be quite cold." `
`"...A mysterious 19th person as a visitor. `
`Sounds pretty interestin', just like a mystery novel. `
`Normally, in that kind of story, it's a safe bet that the person doesn't exist, that one of us 18 would be fakin' it." `
`"...I suspect Genji and the others. `
`Just as I thought, it would have been better if we had dismissed all of the servants of the One-Winged Eagle, no matter what excuses we had to make." `
`"Come now, don't say that. `
`We must be grateful for their long years of service. `
`...Of course, we can't let our guard down." `
`"I'm sure you agree too, Nii-san, that whether or not Father was behind this, `
`the person who handed Maria the letter was a servant." `
`"Indeed. `
`In any event, we were all being "friendly" in our big happy circle until dinner, weren't we? `
`All of the siblings have alibis. `
`Only a servant could have handed Maria that letter." `
`"...But all of the servants... `
`said that they were too busy with the bed-making to have any spare time during which they could go to Maria-chan in the rose garden... `
`........." `
`"Hey hey, what are you trying to say then? `
`You aren't saying that the witch of the forest, Beatrice-sama, came over and actually handed Maria that letter, are you?" `
`"Ahahaha. `
`Rosa, you used to believe in that so much, it really frightened you, right? `
`Don't tell me you still believe at this age. `
`In the witch of the forest." `
`...If she did exist, I'd love for her to appear. `
`But no matter how much I wished, she didn't appear before me even once. `
`She didn't save me from my crisis... `
`"O-Of course not... `
`I just thought that since all 18 of us said we didn't do it, there might really be a 19th person..." `
`"That can't be. In the first place, we were the only ones who came in on that boat. `
`We didn't see any mysterious stranger ridin' with us. `
`You don't think they coulda swam across this rough sea, right? `
`I can't really imagine it. `
`Wahahahahahaha." `
`"...Logically, that's true. `
`It is difficult to imagine that there's a single hidden and uninvited guest on this isolated island... `
`...However, `
`......it looks like some of us still can't abandon the possibility completely, right?" `
`Hideyoshi had laughed it off, saying there couldn't be a 19th person, `
`but Kyrie had sensitively picked up on the delicate atmosphere among the four siblings. `
`In a normal situation, there shouldn't have been any uninvited guests on this small, isolated island. `
`How would they have come here, and from where, and where were they hiding? `
`And why hadn't they appeared openly, even though they had sent a letter in their name? `
`...Nothing could explain that. `
`But not only had the four siblings not joined in on Hideyoshi's laughing, `
`they also seemed unable to completely deny in their hearts the possibility of a 19th person... `
`"Kyrie-san, `
`please don't misunderstand. It's not as though we believe in anything like that fairy tale-like legend of the witch." `
`"...Is this another topic to insult Father? `
`Simply speaking of such a thing is a betrayal against him." `
`"*giggle*giggle* `
`I wonder. `
`...However, this is Father we're talking about. `
`It could be possible, ...right?" `
`"......I-I don't know anything..." `
`"What's this, what's this? `
`Why's everyone gotten so gloomy...? `
`What are you talkin' about? `
`...In short, the legend of the witch isn't a joke, ...but a fact? `
`That's ridiculous!" `
`"Hahahaha. `
`Of course, nobody believes in some witch riding a broom and flying in the sky. `
`...But the woman in that portrait, `
`...Beatrice, might really have existed on this island." `
`"......Hideyoshi-san, `
`it looks like we aren't talking about a witch, but something a little simpler. `
`...So, it must be something like this." `
`"Everyone suspects that Father had a mistress named Beatrice secretly living somewhere on this island. `
`...Is that it?" `
`"Father was always exemplary at keeping strictly to the rules! `
`It is completely inconceivable that he would bring something so filthy onto this island...!" `
`Natsuhi snapped at them immediately, but it looked like the four siblings, including Krauss, didn't agree. `
`...On the contrary, they appeared to think Kinzo wouldn't even have hesitated to do something like that. `
`From the beginning, it had been whispered that Kinzo had built a mansion on this island `
`specifically because of the existence of an entrancing mistress... `
`"...I'm sorry, Natsuhi-san. I know how much you respect Dad, but that rumor's been around for a long time. `
`All the buildings on Rokkenjima were built by Dad on his own." `
`"...People've always guessed he had some contraption or secret room set up in this mansion that only he knew about, `
`and it's always been whispered that, hidden somewhere on this island, there's a secret mansion none of us know about." `
`"I see. `
`This island might look small on a map, ...but it's quite large for just the Ushiromiya family to live on. `
`...So people have suspected that he built a secret mansion somewhere in the uncivilized forest for his mistress to live in? `
`That would be quite a large-scale scheme." `
`"In the beginning, people thought it might be somewhere inside this mansion. `
`...That there might be a hidden basement, with a fabulous hidden room, where the witch in that portrait was secretly hiding. `
`...After seeing that intricate auto-lock on Dad's study, it isn't too hard to imagine, right?" `
`"...After all, Father did spread the rumor that a large amount of gold was hidden somewhere by some mechanism. `
`I wouldn't be surprised if there existed some hidden room inside this very mansion that none of us knows about yet." `
`"When Mother was alive, she would often scour the entire mansion searching for Father when he wasn't anywhere to be found. `
`...Mother also suspected what Rudolf just said. `
`She believed there was a hidden door or stairway somewhere, and that his blonde-haired mistress was hidden behind it." `
`It's hard to believe, but there are some actual examples in other countries of people cheating with someone over a period of several decades by making them live in a hidden attic room. `
`Furthermore, Kinzo had a mansion this extravagant. `
`...It was possible to suspect the existence of a hidden room... `
`"From what I've heard, `
`...the legend of the Rokkenjima witch was just a fairy tale made up to scare children away from the uncivilized forest. `
`...But it's starting to sound like there's a little more to the story." `
`"Well, `
`as you know, this is a lonely island without anything but the Ushiromiya mansion on it. `
`When Rosa and I were little brats, on stormy nights, we got so scared by the sound of trees rustling in the direction of the forest. `
`We had this crazy delusion that something weird might be looking out at us from between those trees. `
`It's only natural for a brat to think of stuff like that." `
`"...But when Rosa and I complained about it, some people figured it was more than a brat's imagination. `
`...Isn't that right, Aneki?" `
`"......Yeah. `
`Nii-san and I thought you might've coincidentally spotted Father's mistress, living in secrecy on this island, as she went out for a walk when no one was looking. `
`Of course, Mother felt the same." `
`"...Even among the older servants, you often heard that ghost story about how the witch of the portrait wanders the mansion at midnight. `
`Outwardly, I laughed it off as just a ghost story, but on the inside, I suspected very much that it hinted at the existence of a hidden mistress." `
`"In that case, ......you're sayin' that the existence of a 19th person... `
`might not be completely ridiculous? `
`...That they might actually be somewhere around here...?" `
`"......Sounds like one of those "Devil's Proofs" Rudolf's always talking about. `
`...It might be possible to prove that there is a 19th person, but it's impossible to prove that a 19th person doesn't exist. `
`...Should we continue this discussion under the assumption that there's a person named Beatrice hiding somewhere on this island...?" `
`"That's a good plan, from the perspective of risk management. `
`It's probably much more prudent to say she might exist, rather than saying she couldn't exist." `
`"I-I see. `
`Sorry, I was a bit careless... `
`Rosa-san, sorry for laughin' just now..." `
`"Huh, ...ah, ...it's fine, I don't mind." `
`Hideyoshi apologized deeply for taking the worst-case scenario lightly, despite calling himself the president of a company. `
`Silence fell again. `
`Preparing for the existence of a 19th person... `
`would mean, in effect, acknowledging the presence of some unknown person hidden on this island. `
`And since this person might be planning something shady, `
`it was only natural that the conversation would turn in an ominous direction... `
`"...In the past, Father would sometimes suddenly disappear without telling anyone where he went. `
`After all, he is a man who values silence. `
`It wouldn't have been out of the ordinary for him to shut himself up in some library room after purposefully not telling anyone where he was going." `
`"...However, when the witch theory was slowly refined into the theory about his mistress, people eventually whispered that he was secretly going back and forth to see her." `
`"Mom was totally paranoid in her last years. `
`She'd sometimes suddenly start making a fuss, asking the servants to start looking for Dad immediately because of some urgent situation." `
`"...Yes, that did happen sometimes. `
`Mother was always doing things like that in her later years, and that frightening atmosphere still hasn't gone away. `
`...I can say it for certain now. `
`She was a person to be pitied." `
`"So then, ...what happened with those large-scale searches of the house? `
`Did they find anythin'?" `
`"No. `
`Father wasn't caught foolishly in a hidden room even once. `
`Always, after a long time had passed, he would suddenly show up somewhere. `
`Then he'd say that he'd taken a nap in some library room, or that the wind had summoned him to take a walk on the beach." `
`"...But it was always some place where the servants had already looked. `
`...We never knew where Father had gone. `
`Even at that time, Grandfather was famous for his occult inclinations, `
`so some of the servants exaggerated, saying that he might have turned into butterflies and danced around the rose garden." `
`"So in short, Father frequently disappeared, and no one knew where he went." `
`"Yeah. `
`Since we couldn't find him no matter how much we looked inside the mansion, we got more and more sure that Dad might've been somewhere outside. `
`But the area outside the mansion isn't large at all. `
`...Which leaves only the forest." `
`"And if you tie that in with the legend of the witch, you get a theory like this: `
`Father actually built a hidden mansion somewhere in the forest, `
`inside of which a mistress by the name of Beatrice lived, and he sometimes went to see her." `
`"...I was also young at the time. `
`I was so eager to find where Father was having his affair that, at one time, I followed him when he went outside." `
`"...Of course, it was a failure. `
`Every time Father went out, he was oddly intent on avoiding places where he might be seen...and was extremely careful to prevent anyone from spotting him. `
`And, he was extraordinarly earnest in his attempts to do so. `
`But that actually made me sure. `
`He must have been going out for some reason that the members of his family couldn't know about." `
`"And that'd be going to meet his mistress. `
`Probably tryin' to avoid being seen." `
`After seeing Hideyoshi nod and say "yes, yes" as though this was quite obvious, Eva got a little sullen. `
`"...Well, anyway, `
`this island was like a sketchbook in which Father, with his Western obsession, could draw out all of his dreams. `
`...Everything about this island was exactly how Father wanted it. `
`It wouldn't be odd at all if there was a hidden mansion somewhere for his mistress to live in..." `
`Eva's words spoke for what all of the siblings had come to think. `
`For a while, the room returned to silence again, and everyone listened to the sound of the wind and rain... `
`...Was there a hidden mansion on this island, and had Kinzo's mistress been living there in hiding for a long, long time...? `
`Everyone thought they were being too suspicious, and they hesitated for a long time without speaking, `
`...but everyone shared a common opinion. `
`Kyrie, who had been listening the whole time with her eyes closed, spoke to no one in particular. `
`"...How long has this rumor about Father's mistress been around?" `
`"As soon as we moved to this island, about 30 years ago. `
`After all, it probably would've been impossible for him to have a hidden mansion built while we were here. `
`People and materials would have to be going in and out. `
`It would've been exposed quickly." `
`"So, if it was possible, it happened before we moved here. `
`...It probably could've been built along with this mansion when we were still living in Odawara." `
`"Since Father had to set up a double life with his family and his mistress, it's probably reasonable to assume that he had it all planned from the beginning. `
`And his relationship with that mistress probably went back to the days when we lived in Odawara." `
`"Probably. `
`If, as Father says, she is the source of the vast amount of gold he used to gain the funds that resurrected the Ushiromiya family, `
`we could probably conclude that they had a close relationship since Odawara. `
`...A relationship trusting enough for her to lend him a vast quantity of gold. `
`I can't even imagine how old that relationship must have been." `
`"......Perhaps Father gave her some kind of valuable advice for succeeding in business. `
`It's natural to think that, out of a sense of gratitude for that, this person gave Father the gold. `
`If you think about it that way, it's obvious that they would have a close relationship after that. `
`Rather than a festering relationship with a mistress, it was probably a relationship of gratitude to the person who saved the Ushiromiya family from its crisis." `
`"...I don't know if what Natsuhi-san's saying has a ring of truth to it or not. `
`But, even in that case, isn't building a hidden mansion and havin' her live in it going a bit too far? `
`Doesn't that mean they felt something a bit more than gratitude?" `
`"Well, this is all just speculation. `
`...In the first place, no one's ever found that hidden mansion. `
`...Aniki, you were planning on expanding this island into a resort, right? `
`As you were doing that, you didn't manage to stumble on it by chance, did you? `
`Maybe you even bumped into some gold there, too." `
`"...Hahahaha. `
`Do you think Rokkenjima is Treasure Island or something?" `
`"Don't play dumb. `
`...We know that, although you say you're opening a resort, you have really been planning to investigate the entire island, right? `
`Judging by all that trouble and confusion we were talking about earlier, you haven't been very successful, have you?" `
`"I don't know what you're talking about, but it's a misunderstanding. `
`Isn't it perfectly natural that investigating this island would be the first step in turning it into a resort?" `
`Krauss tried to play dumb, but it was plainly obvious to his siblings, who knew him so well. `
`...Krauss was definitely sure of the existence of a hidden mansion. `
`And under the pretense of opening a resort, he had been closely investigating the island, searching for a clue as to the location of the hidden gold. `
`They couldn't tell whether that conviction was just him overthinking things, or whether it was based on some physical proof. `
`...Still, if Krauss, with all his guile, was sure, `
`that was enough proof for the other siblings to be sure too... `
`"...The story about a witch livin' in a forest is obviously a fairy tale, `
`but the story about some blonde-haired girl livin' secretly in a mansion no one knows about in the middle of the forest...isn't much better." `
`"That's right. `
`That really would be just like a fairy tale. `
`You like those, don't you, Rosa?" `
`"...Huh, ...w-well..." `
`"When the mansion was built on this island, Father was at the height of his prosperity. `
`With his money, he could probably obtain anything, make any of his wild imaginings real. `
`...A mansion in the forest where a witch quietly waits... `
`...It sounds like the kind of situation Father would like." `
`"...Doesn't it? `
`Like something from the occult or a fairy tale. `
`...It feels like Dad's kind of hobby." `
`On this island, on which the Ushiromiya family had lived for 30 years now, `
`a hidden mansion that no one knew about had been quietly built to house a witch, about whom nothing was known except what could be guessed from a portrait... `
`Even this hastily thrown together theory... `
`might not be completely delusional, considering all of Kinzo's strange habits and his vast wealth... `
`"...It might not have been impossible for Father to build a hidden mansion to satisfy his dreams. `
`...However, let's be realistic. `
`Would it be possible to house his beloved woman in that hidden mansion for decades without it becoming inconvenient...?" `
`"...Well, `
`if there was love, it could've been doable, right?" `
`"Think of the facilities needed to let his beloved woman live healthily. `
`...And in a way that would satisfy Father. `
`For example, even if it was on a small scale, it would have to be an intricate and pleasant residence." `
`"And it would probably need to have... `
`electricity, `
`gas, `
`and running water maintained, `
`As well as possibly some people to help her. `
`Even providing for her meals would be quite difficult." `
`"She would need clothes and makeup, daily necessities. `
`...The needs of a woman aren't simple. `
`......Would it be possible to maintain all of that without any of the family or the servants noticing?" `
`"......When you say it that way, it sure sounds like a weak point in our theory. `
`...But that isn't enough to get rid of my feeling that Dad might've been able to do it anyway. `
`After all, it's Dad we're talking about." `
`"That's right. `
`...It's our Father." `
`"If Father wanted to succeed in an endeavor, he would succeed no matter what. `
`...Saying that something would be difficult for a normal person and therefore impossible...doesn't apply when it comes to Father." `
`"Indeed. `
`You should never underestimate Father. `
`...Father's madness can't be understood by normal people." `
`I wouldn't put it past "that" Kinzo. `
`...As long as you stick to this phrase, a considerable amount of credibility can dwell in any absurd story. `
`However, that didn't cause the importance of what Kyrie had said to waver. `
`This was different from stealthily raising a kitten in a cardboard box and keeping it a secret from your parents. `
`Taking care of a person in secret over a period of 30 years would be an incalculably massive task... `
`"...After all, Father's Legend of the Gold started before he gained possession of Rokkenjima. `
`That'd mean his relationship with his mistress was over 30 years long... `
`How old would that make her? `
`In the worst case, she could be as old as us or older, right?" `
`"...By that age, the body starts to break down. `
`I don't care what the mansion's like, I wouldn't use the word "agreeable" to describe livin' in a place where people's eyes can't reach, almost like she was under house arrest..." `
`"That's right. `
`...If what Father told us about Beatrice is true, then that relationship has lasted for over 30 years. `
`...She might've been a charming young woman at the time, but it probably makes sense to assume she's an old bag like us now. `
`I can easily imagine that, given the contents of that letter." `
`"You should talk. `
`Heheheh." `
`Krauss laughed as if none of this applied to him. `
`Of course, Eva was offended, but she didn't strike back. `
`"Quit it, Aniki. `
`...So if everything we're thinking's true, then she should be joining in on Dad's inheritance problem with her head held high. `
`After all, ...there's a good chance their love was mutual, unlike with Mom. `
`Even if she knows she's his mistress, she might also be proud to be his true wife." `
`"......That is an insult to Mother." `
`"Yeah, sorry. `
`...However, everyone knows that it was a political marriage decided on by the elders among his relatives. `
`...Because of that, it definitely wouldn't be strange for Dad to have a mistress." `
`The family sank after the Great Kanto Earthquake, and Father was set up as the Ushiromiya Family Head against his will. `
`However, in the beginning, the elder relatives treated Kinzo like a dummy and influenced him powerfully, almost like he was a puppet. `
`He wasn't permitted to decide anything by himself, not even his marriage partner... `
`...Ever since he met that Golden Witch Beatrice in those distant days, `
`Kinzo's Legend of the Gold was quickly embellished into something dramatic. `
`In other words, `
`...it could mean... `
`that Kinzo really did find a woman he loved. `
`If she also knew the whole story, `
`even if they weren't marriage partners, it wouldn't have been odd for her to consider herself his true wife inside her heart. `
`...And now, the person registered as his true wife was already dead... `
`"...Which means she might feel confident staking her claim, not just for the rights to his assets, but regarding the battle over the Headship too." `
`"......I see. `
`I'm starting to see the purpose of this letter. `
`The Headship goes to the one who solves the riddle of the epitaph... `
`Is that what it means...?" `
`"Even if that mistress was added into the family ranking system, she isn't a direct relative of Father, so she'd be inferior even to the children. `
`...In other words, she'd be one step below Rosa in rank. `
`That wouldn't be a good position to enter the battle for the Headship from." `
`"I see, so that's it. `
`...If someone can solve the witch's riddle, they'll get the Headship regardless of rank. `
`In other words, it's the most advantageous condition Beatrice could possibly get, since she's got no chance otherwise." `
`The revival of the Ushiromiya family was made possible by the gold Beatrice had bestowed. `
`...That was quite a distinguishing service she had provided. `
`She had built that wealth together with Kinzo, so it was natural that she would think of herself as the one who should inherit it... `
`It would also be natural for her to despise the thought of giving it up to the children of the wife Kinzo never loved. `
`"H-How could she be so impudent...?! `
`Even if such a mistress actually exists, joining in on the battle for the rights to the Head's inheritance would be a reckless action far above her place! `
`What disregard for her own position...!" `
`Natsuhi turned red, her fist quivering. `
`...She had also come into the Ushiromiya register due to complicated circumstances. `
`Those who knew that understood more or less why she was so angry for the sake of Kinzo's dead wife. `
`"...Well, thanks to that reckless action of hers, we all have an even chance now, right? `
`Father has even given it his silent approval. `
`...Will the person who succeeds the Ushiromiya family be his mistress Beatrice, or one of us, the relatives he doesn't love? `
`Maybe he wants to make us struggle over that to see who's worthy." `
`As Eva giggled roguishly, Krauss shrugged his shoulders and looked away. `
`"...However, since she's the one who brought this rule to light in the first place, `
`maybe that means it gives her a significant advantage." `
`"Th-That's right. `
`...In the first place, if Beatrice meant that letter literally, then she's Father's alchemist. `
`In other words, she's the manager of his gold. `
`It wouldn't be strange at all if she knew where it was hidden, would it?!" `
`"Isn't that harsh? `
`It's like she's giving us a riddle she knows the answer to! `
`She'll probably show up rudely, say "Hey, here's the answer, I'll take the Headship now", `
`and snatch everything away from us!" `
`"............ `
`...That's right. `
`The person who brings up a riddle always knows the answer. `
`There's a good chance that this is all a trap to steal everything from us." `
`"...If you think about it like that, don't you start to doubt whether she really had any gold in the first place? `
`Why would she tell us about it? `
`All she has to do is keep quiet and embezzle it." `
`"It really is... `
`strange." `
`That certainly was the case. `
`If the epitaph showed the way to the hidden gold, why would she challenge them to try and solve it? `
`If they actually did solve it, wouldn't the gold all be stolen from her...? `
`Could it be that this person was trying to stir the siblings up so they'd solve the epitaph, `
`and then planned to steal it away at the last second...? `
`It was an extremely logical possibility. `
`"......No, `
`if you spin the chessboard around, there might be a pretty good chance that they actually do have the gold." `
`"Why are you so certain?" `
`"...Wait, Aneki. `
`...Kyrie, please keep talking. `
`Why do you think that?" `
`"After all, do they really think we'll let go of the Ushiromiya Family Headship... `
`just because someone tells us the answer to the riddle in the witch's epitaph? `
`That we'll be so impressed by their answer...that we'll just give up?" `
`"...Well, `
`...that's true. `
`No way they're so naive that they assumed we'd just give up after being told the answer to a riddle, `
`that we'd just say "Here you go" and hand it over." `
`"Of course. `
`The Headship of the Ushiromiya family is not something that can be handed over so easily!" `
`"That's it exactly. `
`No matter how Beatrice might one-sidedly propose a game like this, even if she were to spectacularly show us the answer, `
`there's no way we'd obediently hand over the Headship. `
`...In other words, unless she has a compelling force in the form of challenging us to a game with equal conditions for us all, `
`this won't truly count as a game." `
`"You're right. `
`...Unless the losers have no choice but to give up on the Headship {i:because of a compelling force}, this won't really count as a game." `
`"And what might this compelling force be? `
`Would they bind us in chains and threaten us into handing over the Headship?" `
`"......I see. `
`I get it. `
`...They'd just have to do something to make us want to give up the Headship willingly. `
`Yes, I see. `
`...To do that, Beatrice would have to own 10 tons of gold...!" `
`"I-I see, I get it too! `
`In other words, ...it's a trade?!" `
`"Huh? `
`Wh-What do you mean...? `
`A trade? `
`Trade what?!" `
`"The Ushiromiya Family Headship for the hidden gold. `
`...Beatrice surely plans to tell us the location of the 10 tons of gold...and use that as a bribe to gain the Ushiromiya Family Headship." `
`"R‐ridiculous!!" `
`"They want to trade the Headship of the glorious Ushiromiya family for...m-money?! `
`That's blasphemy!! `
`Blasphemy against the Ushiromiya family!!" `
`"...Please listen without getting mad. `
`...About how much wealth does this glorious Ushiromiya family have right now? `
`Are we really that affluent?" `
`"Th-The definition of affluence is not dependent on property. `
`It is about heart! `
`Our financial situation has nothing to-" `
`Krauss interrupted Natsuhi as she started to go on and on emotionally. `
`In this situation, the more she went on like that, the worse it would actually sound. `
`"...Me aside, I hear your current situations are...quite unfavorable." `
`"Oh, really? `
`I've heard that your financial situation's really bad too. `
`Offering up more and more as collateral for new money to gamble with. `
`Repeatedly dabbling in new gambles, unable to accept your losses. `
`...If we count what's going on behind the scenes, you're in even bigger financial straits than the rest of us." `
`"Just how much money have you lost, Nii-san? `
`You have no talent!" `
`"Wh-Who are you saying has no talent?!! `
`And what do you mean, financial straits?!!" `
`Natsuhi became indignant once more, but Krauss raised his hand again and interrupted her. `
`"...It seems you are making a small mistake. `
`Business is not something that can be judged based on current progress alone. `
`For someone with a long-term outlook on business such as myself, `
`it may sometimes appear at a glance that I have suffered significant short-term losses." `
`"Aniki, `
`we've been collecting evidence. `
`Your position right now isn't one to be proud of. `
`...So this is what Kyrie's trying to say. `
`...Every one of us has got money trouble. `
`And Beatrice has 10 tons of gold." `
`"...As the only person who knows the location of the 10 tons of gold, Beatrice is planning on using it to force us to sell the Headship. `
`...About how much is 10 tons of gold worth?" `
`"At a rough estimate, ...let's say 2 billion yen? `
`......No, 20 billion yen. `
`With that much piled up, we'd be ecstatic to accept her as the Successor." `
`The scene returned to silence. `
`In fact, the rain and wind felt even noisier now. `
`...It was probably the sound of the windstorm racing through the insides of their minds... `
`"......Th-This isn't funny. `
`...To think we'd give up the Headship to some woman of doubtful origin... `
`...just because she had a little money stored up..." `
`"Don't be stupid...! `
`The Headship wasn't even yours in the first place, right...?! `
`We've got nothin' to lose and money to gain. `
`We'll have to calculate our profit and loss, but it's somethin' worth listenin' to...!" `
`They knew that Krauss had eaten up much of the Ushiromiya family's assets. `
`So, it was dregs that remained of that inheritance, ...versus "the cost of being accepted as the Head" that Beatrice would pay. `
`It was a shame, but honestly, the former was less enticing than the latter. `
`"...Well, it probably wouldn't end up as four equal portions. `
`Since Aniki would be giving up his position of Successor, his portion would have to be larger. `
`...Makes me feel kinda jealous, you know?" `
`"............" `
`"Dear...! `
`The amount of money isn't the problem, right?! `
`Your cowardly younger siblings are trying to sell the glory of the Ushiromiya family for money, don't you see?! `
`Why aren't you displaying your dignity as the oldest son?!" `
`"......Natsuhi, `
`stay quiet for a while." `
`"Dear?!?!" `
`"...This is a dizzying proposal. `
`...We were each planning on getting 250 million yen out of Aniki. `
`If the witch treats us with ten percent of those 10 tons, `
`...ummm-" `
`"That's 2 billion." `
`"...Yeah. `
`That'd mean she's treating us with ten times our original goal. `
`That alone would be more than enough for us. `
`...It's not like I've got any attachment to the Ushiromiya name. `
`I'd be happy to sell it off..." `
`"Even if 10 tons is a slightly optimistic figure, `
`......yes, it'd still be a fascinating prospect for us. `
`...We were trying to form an alliance among the siblings to kick this outsider called Beatrice out." `
`"...But, if this is her plan, `
`...it'll tear apart the unity between us. `
`...Yeah, by this point we can state it clearly. `
`...The goal of Beatrice's letter was to disturb our alliance." `
`If the three younger siblings, who never had anything to do with the inheritance, `
`were paid enough money to satisfy them, they would happily accept Beatrice as the next Head. `
`A moat had been dug all around Krauss. `
`In that case, the negotiations would be one-on-one between her and Krauss. `
`He tried to look strong, but Krauss's financial and political situation was extremely weak. `
`...He might bluff in front of his siblings, but on the inside, he was considering entering negotiations, depending on the sum of money involved. `
`In order to bury his losses, Krauss had taken advantage of the fact that Kinzo had shut himself up in his room...and had embezzled Kinzo's personal assets. `
`Therefore, when Kinzo died and the inheritance was distributed, Krauss's situation would probably be investigated. `
`But if he gave up his seat as the Head to Beatrice, `
`she would also receive rights to the assets, and as a result, the distribution of the inheritance to the siblings would not occur. `
`...In other words, Krauss' embezzlement might not have to be made known to the other siblings... `
`Of course, the siblings were frightened of Kinzo, but it was doubtful whether they still actually respected him as a father. `
`By this time, they each had their own families, their own wealth, and their own lives. `
`If they were paid enough money in exchange for Rokkenjima, the wreckage of Kinzo's dreams, `
`...there was a significant likelihood that they'd relinquish the Ushiromiya family name... `
`In other words, Beatrice's victory was already guaranteed in this "game". `
`Not as the winner of "Beatrice's game", `
`...but as the winner of "Kinzo's game". `
`...Kinzo once ordered that the epitaph be put on display. `
`And until today, no one had solved it. `
`So Beatrice "solved" it. `
`In other words, this is less of a game and more like Beatrice's declaration of victory... `
`However, Kyrie still thought there might be a catch. `
`If this was a declaration of victory, Beatrice would only have had to display the gold openly and state her intent to buy the inheritance. `
`And yet, she had gone to all of this trouble, telling the siblings to try and solve the epitaph. `
`Why did she set up this "new game", where she agreed to hand over the all of the gold and the inheritance to the epitaph solver? `
`Kyrie tried spinning the chessboard around several times. `
`...She searched for the sort of ideal strategy Beatrice might be after, something that could lead to this kind of thinking. `
`...In the end, ...she reached a single conclusion. `
`"......Could it be... `
`arrogance? `
`Or maybe... `
`she's playing...?" `
`"...What are you talking about?" `
`"The witch sent us a letter of challenge, forcing us to try and solve the epitaph. `
`She might be taking us lightly, thinking we could never solve it. `
`...However, at the very least, there ought to be an extremely small chance that we do solve it." `
`"After all, we have here four of Father's children by blood, right? `
`The questioner called together four blood relatives who, if they tried frantically to work together and avoid having those assets stolen from them, `
`might come across the answer of the riddle by chance." `
`The reason the witch had a superior position in negotiations compared to the siblings...was that only she knew the location of the hidden gold. `
`But if that hiding place was exposed to someone other than her, the witch's advantage would crumble. `
`"In short, Beatrice gains nothing but risk by writing this witch's letter of challenge. `
`...Of course, it might have had the effect of splitting apart the siblings' alliance, `
`but if that was her only goal, why would she take this risk, however slight it might be...? `
`That seems reckless to me." `
`"...But if we keep in mind a certain type of emotion, that risk becomes comprehensible." `
`"......... `
`...And you're saying it's arrogance?" `
`"Yes, that's right. `
`...When people have an overwhelming advantage, they tend to get arrogant. `
`And when they do, they want to show off that advantage to the losers, so they sometimes take on small risks. `
`...A moderate amount of risk adds a little spice to the joy of victory. `
`It'd be boring to win without any risk." `
`"......I understand. `
`I like that kind of thing too. `
`...Yeah, I understand it well." `
`"I thought of a few plausible explanations for the true motive behind Beatrice's letter, `
`...but I think this really might be the truth. `
`...The emotion hidden behind that letter was... `
`...arrogance." `
`"......Arrogance." `
`"She's trying to throw her weight around, looking down on us, as if there's no way we could figure out such a difficult epitaph. `
`...It might even be possible, if surprising, that the epitaph wasn't written by Father, but by her." `
`"...Sounds great. `
`...Solve the riddle of the epitaph, she says?" `
`If only I solved it, I would be made the Head, right...? `
`...I'll solve it... `
`I'll accept the witch's challenge. `
`As if those other idiot siblings could solve it. `
`I'll solve it by myself, and then I'll prove that I'm the one who's fit to succeed the Ushiromiya family... `
`"I'll take that challenge. `
`...I will... `
`solve the riddle..." `
