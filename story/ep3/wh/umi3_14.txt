`"...Certainly, the body cannot last with nothing more than a small breakfast, but..." `
`"Of course, we understand. `
`Still, as time passes, it'll get darker and darker out. `
`It's probably at its brightest now. `
`It's the most convenient time." `
`"Only about an hour has passed since Rosa-san was attacked. `
`This is simply too reckless...!" `
`It was only natural that Natsuhi was yelling about recklessness. `
`...After all, Rudolf had said he was going to the mansion to get food. `
`Certainly, on top of their fatigue, their hunger was tormenting them. `
`In the beginning, a mild level of hunger had been just what they needed to fight off drowsiness. `
`However, it now just made their minds hazy, since it was still only midday, and their bodies felt like they were reaching their limits. `
`The thought of going to the kitchen in the mansion and bringing back some food certainly was attractive. `
`"I am opposed to this. `
`It may be a little rough, but we definitely shouldn't leave this place." `
`"...Don't worry about us, `
`but it would pain my heart to keep the children hungry... `
`I must be responsible as a parent." `
`"D-Dear...! `
`Now that Father is dead, you are the Ushiromiya Family Head. `
`It is not permissible for you to take on such a danger...!" `
`"......You're right. `
`It's like Natsuhi-san says. `
`Krauss-san, you should remain here, as our leader." `
`"...Then who will go to the mansion?" `
`"I think it should be Kyrie and me, and Hideyoshi-san too. `
`Hideyoshi-san and I have guns. `
`They shouldn't be able to lay a hand on us that easily." `
`"Rosa-san also had a gun, but she was attacked. `
`...Won't it be dangerous?" `
`"...When I went out to check on Rosa and Maria-chan, I had a gun, but I was alone. `
`And yet, I wasn't attacked. `
`...Maybe they'll be cautious if their opponent is a man." `
`"We'll have two men. `
`And even two guns. `
`Those two will act as guards, and I'll transport our cargo using a cart. `
`I believe the situation will be significantly different than it was for Rosa-san." `
`"If you're countin' on me 'cause I'm a man, I'd be happy to help. `
`I may not look it, but I'm built up pretty strong from pushin' food stands around. `
`Leave the heavy liftin' to me!" `
`"You men can devote youselves to guarding. `
`There's a folding cart in the servant room, and using that, I should be able to handle carrying the food. `
`...Of course, we'll be careful. `
`And if we can succeed in this adventure just once, `
`there won't be any need for us to take risks again." `
`"......Is there any way I can get you to rethink this? `
`It may be painful for everyone to deal with empty stomachs, ...but even so, we do not know what is happening outside now..." `
`"We'll take care. `
`...And Eva's feelin' pretty darn bad right now. `
`We can't let her stay hungry. `
`If her stomach's empty, she can't take her medicine. `
`I have to go out for Eva's sake as well." `
`"How is Eva?" `
`"Looks like she's finally gotten to sleep. `
`...She has a high fever. `
`If we just leave her be for a while..." `
`"...You can't just stand still when it comes to your wife's health... `
`......Understood. `
`I'll give you permission to go outside." `
`"Then, we'll take a little trip there and back. `
`A speed contest. `
`Canned food's okay, right? `
`You at least have a can opener here, don't you?" `
`"Y-Yes. `
`We have a can opener and a bottle opener..." `
`"There's running water in the guesthouse, so we won't need anything to drink. `
`We need to get ten people's worth, so no being picky about what you get." `
`"All right! `
`Why don't we dash out and bring it back quickly? `
`There's no time to open umbrellas...!" `
`"See you, Aniki. `
`I'll trust you to look after this place." `
`"...Take care. `
`...Under normal circumstances, I'd want to go too. `
`...Being a man, I despise how this title of the oldest brother prevents me from lending a hand in an emergency like this." `
`"This is about the only time we get to show off. `
`Sit back and take it easy every once in a while, Aniki. `
`Okay, Natsuhi-san. `
`Wait here and get some towels ready or something. `
`We aren't using umbrellas, so we'll be soaked to the bone when we get back." `
`"U-Understood. `
`...Take care." `
`Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi, `
`each leaving their own brave words behind, left the lobby... `
`Compared to the time Rosa and Maria had gone outside, the winds were much stronger. `
`Rudolf's group of three people jogged through the rose garden without umbrellas, holding their guns and a folded cart. `
`If everything had been still and quiet, without the wind and the rain, they would probably have kept their ears open and moved with caution. `
`But in this rain, even if some suspicious person was hiding nearby, it would be difficult to notice them. `
`Because of that, it had been Rudolf's plan to instead dash through the dangerous area. `
`...If there was a chance that their opponent was equipped with a gun, `
`then walking slowly with their guard up would only make them targets. `
`Taking swift action was probably the correct choice. `
`"......The rose garden. `
`It feels like we're just askin' to be attacked...!" `
`"Please, let nobody come out of there..." `
`Even as Rudolf and Hideyoshi continued to run, they looked around restlessly, vigilant of their surroundings. `
`Rosa and Maria's deaths had not been caused by a projectile weapon. `
`...However, it was easy to suspect that the servants had been killed in such a manner. `
`Will they come flying out of the dark? `
`Or will they take careful aim and snipe from the shadows? `
`...Either way, they couldn't relax their tension for even an instant. `
`But even so, when they reached the overhang in front of the entrance to the mansion and escaped the reach of the raindrops, `
`they felt themselves breathing a sigh of relief. `
`"No problems for the first step. `
`...Unlike how it was for Rosa-san. `
`Maybe they can't get their hands on us easily." `
`"I'd like to believe that. `
`Kyrie, unlock the door while we keep a lookout." `
`"Sure. `
`Returning home to the mansion with a pair of SPs makes me feel just like an executive." `
`"Wahahahaha. `
`If we had a welcoming party of servants with a red carpet, it'd be perfect." `
`"A welcoming party, huh? `
`...You never know. `
`Be careful." `
`As the two cautiously surveyed their surroundings, `
`Kyrie unlocked the entrance with the master key she had been given. `
`"It's open." `
`"Hideyoshi-san, `
`could you take the front? `
`I'll keep an eye on the rear." `
`"Understood. `
`Kyrie-san, try not to move from my shadow. `
`...Okay, let's break in!" `
`"Rear guard, roger that. Covering...!" `
`"...Ah, men. `
`Even in a situation like this, you're just playing around, aren't you?" `
`"Give it up, that's how men are. `
`...Seriously though, that stench is awful." `
`...It felt like the air in the mansion was stagnant with a gloomy silence. `
`And on top of that, it was still thick with the stench from Kinzo's burnt corpse in the boiler room, `
`and they were struck with an uncontrollable desire to leave the mansion. `
`"No problems in the front. `
`Just a short dash to the kitchen." `
`"Let's finish this quickly and head home. `
`This suit'll get fumigated with Dad's stench." `
`The three of them dashed towards the kitchen... `
`And after they disappeared from the entrance hall, ...the new witch appeared there. `
`"They were lured out just as planned. `
`...Just as planned, they got caught in my trap." `
`The witch grinned. `
`...Thinking about it now, no matter how unbearable their hunger had grown, `
`it hadn't even been a few hours since Rosa and Maria had been attacked and had lost their lives. `
`In that case, why had they needed to recklessly leave the guesthouse...? `
`Until that question could be dealt with, the only answer was that they had been called out by the witch's magic... `
`"What reckless people. `
`...They'll never leave this mansion alive. `
`Seal yourself, lock. Seal yourself, mansion!" `
`The instant she proclaimed that... `
`The mansion was sealed off into a separate world. `
`...Unless her barrier was undone, no longer would anyone be able to exit this mansion or enter it. `
`"...Spectacular. `
`To think that even though barely half a day has passed since you succeeded the Endless Witch, you can use magic this well. `
`...That talent surprises me. `
`It's almost as though you were born a witch." `
`"Well, I have been a witch since the time of my birth. `
`...Who taught you how to blink? `
`That's what using magic is like for me." `
`"......... `
`...What a fearsome person." `
`The witch's face twisted with brutality. `
`...She just couldn't help looking forward to toying with someone's life again. `
`"Well then... `
`...Gehehehehhihhihihihihihihyahya! `
`First up is Rudolf and Kyrie, but in what cruel way should I kill them...?!" `
`"...If you don't mind me saying, `
`your Predecessor-sama has left instructions that you are to restrain yourself from committing murders of unnecessary cruelty. `
`And, there is an etiquette for offering the sacrifices from the fourth twilight onwards. `
`For that, you must borrow the power of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory." `
`"...Oh, really? `
`Now that you mention it, that's right. `
`I could only play as I like with that second twilight. `
`.........Boring. `
`Just when I thought I could play to my heart's content like I did with Rosa." `
`"...But, that only counts for how they're killed in the end, right?" `
`"Meaning...?" `
`"I could just kill them however I want over and over again, revive them, `
`and then follow the epitaph during the last time I kill them, right?" `
`"...So, in the end, no matter how I play, it isn't a problem. `
`...Who'd act well-behaved with an entertaining power like this...?! `
`Kuhhihihihihihihi!" `
`Her absurd argument was, for an Endless Witch, an extremely valid one. `
`The etiquette that controlled the manner of killing the sacrifices of the fourth twilight and onward was represented by lines like "gouge the head". `
`However, that referred to the way those people died in the end. `
`In other words, ...in the process leading up to that, she was free to tease and kill them however she wanted. `
`She just had to keep on reviving them...and follow the rules only when she killed them the final time. `
`Though Ronove felt that her innocent cruelty was part of her talent as a witch, `
`he was beginning to notice a innately brutal side of her. `
`"...They do say that apprentices are the most brutal of witches, and now I see this may be true. `
`......Do as you wish...is what I would like to say, `
`but here, it may actually be wiser to show restraint. `
`They have guns. `
`Weapons with a high anti-magic power, such as guns, are the natural enemies of witches and demons." `
`The witch stared blankly at this demon butler, who was surprisingly afraid of guns. `
`"......That can't be right. `
`Shouldn't witches be able to take a shot from a bullet easily?" `
`"No. `
`It would be just as fatal for a witch as it would be for a normal Human. `
`...To prevent that weak point from being noticed, `
`most witches rigorously strengthen their guard with a defense of protective barriers and furniture." `
`"Do I have any of those protective barrier things?" `
`"...Constructing a barrier to make even gun bullets ineffective requires much in the way of preparation and ceremonies. `
`I am afraid to say that {f:5:Beatrice}-sama currently has none of those. `
`Furthermore, you are currently ill prepared to summon furniture strong enough to block a bullet." `
`"So even though I've become a Great Witch with this much magical power, I really do have to be afraid of lead bullets. `
`......It's annoying, but I don't have a choice. `
`So, in that case, should I call some furniture to act as my arms and legs?" `
`"Yes. `
`Leaving everything to your servants while not exposing yourself to danger is also a part of a witch's refined tastes. `
`{f:5:Beatrice}-sama, leave this to the furniture and hide in a safe place." `
`"......I get it. `
`...I call on the Seven Sisters of Purgatory. `
`I don't care who, any two...!" `
`Leviathan and Belphegor responded to that call. `
`"Leviathan of Envy, right here." `
`"Belphegor of Sloth, right here." `
`"Show me your power. `
`Your targets are Rudolf and Kyrie. `
`Don't attack Hideyoshi. `
`...Come on, show me just how cruel you can be, furniture." `
`"...My apologies, `
`but we've received orders from the Predecessor-sama to refrain from unnecessarily cruel actions." `
`"Buuut, I think the Predecessor-sama's order does give us some leeway to tease them. `
`Do you still wanna go through with it?" `
`"Hmph. `
`I get it, I'll compromise. `
`...Don't let them die easily. `
`Thoroughly corner them and let them taste the fear of death before killing them. `
`...Will that be okay, Ronove?" `
`"Yes. Depending on the degree, I do not believe there will be a problem." `
`"......Then, go!" `
`""Yes, leave it to us...!"" `
`"Your opponents are armed with guns. `
`...For those such as you, dodging them should be easy, `
`...but if you are hit, the wound will be fatal. `
`Proceed with an appropriate level of caution." `
`"Don't worry. `
`We aren't that incompetent." `
`The two Sisters of Purgatory vanished. `
`Ronove bowed and vanished himself. `
`"......There are even rules on how to kill them. `
`......Why do I have to be constrained by my Predecessor-sama? `
`......It's so rigid and boring." `
`As the witch looked up at the portrait of the Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice} hung in the hall, she cursed... `
`The three people had already arrived at the kitchen and were gathering food supplies. `
`Considering the possibility of poison, they gave up on the alluring fruits and vegetables... `
`and gathered a whole cardboard box full of only the safe canned foods. `
`It was very heavy, but by piling it on the cart, they could carry it well enough. `
`This should be more than enough for ten people to hold out until tomorrow's breakfast. `
`That should carry them until the boat arrives. `
`The two men were supposed to be focused solely on guard duty, but the weight of the load was tough on Kyrie even with the cart. `
`Hideyoshi, who wanted to show off his power, switched to be the cart-pusher, and Rudolf and his wife took up the task of guard duty. `
`"With all this, even George and the kids will be full. `
`The trip back'll be a picnic, so let's go...!" `
`When Hideyoshi vigorously announced their departure, Kyrie frowned and seemed to be gazing into the distance. `
`...There was a wall in that direction. `
`...No, if her gaze could go through that, there was the main hall beyond it... `
`"......What is it, Kyrie?" `
`"...It's vague, `
`......but I've got a bad feeling gnawing at me." `
`Kyrie stopped walking and narrowed her eyes even further. `
`"......Women's intuition?" `
`At times like this, Kyrie's intuition often rang true, even when she didn't have a logical reason. `
`...Rudolf believed in that intuition. `
`"Yes. `
`Someone's probably waiting to ambush us. `
`...I didn't sense them before, `
`...but just now, I felt it. `
`...Just now someone... `
`{i:set up an ambush for us}." `
`"...Then there's no reason to go back the way we came. `
`There's a back door over there, right? `
`Let's leave that way." `
`Rudolf made to unlock the back door. `
`When goods were carried into the kitchen, they never passed through the part of the mansion that the family came and went from. `
`So outside the back door, there was probably a ramp used to carry things in. `
`Surely, they would be able to leave through there with the cart. `
`"...What the heck? `
`...It's stuck. `
`...Damn, what's going on?" `
`"Can't you open it?" `
`"Nope. `
`Is it broken? `
`It isn't giving an inch..." `
`Rudolf tried various things, first using force, then coaxing it, `
`but the lock was as hard as stone and didn't even budge. `
`"...Don't force it. Let's leave through the front entrance. `
`Right now, it'll be even worse if we stand around wasting time." `
`"............" `
`"...You think this is a trap?" `
`"...I don't know. `
`Be careful." `
`With strained expressions, the three of them returned to the hall again and headed for the entrance... `
`"Wh-Who is it?!!" `
`The instant they exited into the hall, Rudolf noticed a suspicious shadow right in front of them and yelled... `
`In that instant, a storm of gold leaf started blowing, and gold butterflies covered the area with a gold color. `
`"......I can't believe it. `
`A lowly Human predicted our ambush?" `
`"I-It isn't my fault. `
`I was hiding my presence...!" `
`"Don't hesitate!! Fire!!!" `
`The two guns spouted fire. `
`The lead bullets blasted right through the magical defense of the pair as easily as though it were a wet paper wall, `
`...but the two figures that should have been there had disappeared. `
`Certainly, guns were frightening objects for them. `
`...But there was no need to fear as long as they weren't hit. `
`They at least had enough speed to dodge those. `
`"Wait a sec! `
`You won't even give us a chance to say our names?! `
`This is why I hate Humans!" `
`Leviathan was a full 10 meters from where she had supposedly been, popping her head out from behind the pillars in the shadow of the staircase and protesting. `
`"In accordance with {f:5:Beatrice}-sama's orders, we will hunt you down! `
`Our orders tell us to make it take some time and to tease you. `
`You are free to resist, but know that it will be useless...!" `
`That voice came from overhead. `
`Belphegor could be seen on top of the hall chandelier. `
`Elegantly looking down upon them, she proclaimed their execution with a cruel smile. `
`"...Wh- `
`What are these girls...?!" `
`"Forget the cart!! `
`We have two opponents, so if we split up, they can't chase all of us!" `
`All three of them were well acquainted with the inside of the mansion. `
`In case of a crisis, they had planned to run off in separate directions, returning to the guesthouse by breaking windows or leaving through a back door. `
`Fighting was forbidden. `
`...As long as they could fully escape. `
`"Hahaha, in a tight spot, escaping is victory...!" `
`The three of them ran into the depths of the mansion at full tilt. `
`That pair of furniture calmly watched them go. `
`"...I'll kill the woman. `
`You take the man!" `
`"Understood." `
`The furniture in the shadows of the pillars and on the chandelier made their figures explode, `
`and, leaving behind only the sound of a hopping beetle knocking against the wall, they pursued their respective targets. `
`Their speed was overwhelming, and they easily blocked the others' paths of retreat. `
`"......Let's see what this furniture's got. `
`I hope they're at least able to amuse me..." `
`"{f:5:Beatrice}-sama, it may not be prudent for you to reveal your form unnecessarily..." `
`"And you don't unnecessarily move your king away from the center. `
`That's part of a monarch's... `
`...and a witch's dignity!" `
`Belphegor was already blocking the way in front of Rudolf, who had boldly tried to escape to the second floor. `
`"It's useless to try and resist or escape. `
`...You don't need to think about anything. `
`Just close your eyes. `
`I'll gently end it all for you." `
`"You'd make a good wife. `
`Husbands love to hear that kind of thing when they come home all tired." `
`"To think you're still relaxed enough to speak with such insolence at a time like this...! `
`{f:5:Beatrice}-sama, thank you for this excellent prey! `
`Die!!!" `
`Rudolf shot first. `
`But even before that bullet could hit her, Belphegor had already moved behind Rudolf's back. `
`She then raised a purple curve springing out from her arm... `
`However, incredibly, before that arm could decapitate Rudolf, he had swung his gun behind him. `
`The barrel remained pointing behind his back...from the same motion with which he had reloaded the sawed-off gun one-handedly. `
`It was pointing right at Belphegor's chest... `
`*click*, *cha-clunk*...! `
`It was the sound of the ejected empty cartridge finally hitting the wall after the reload. `
`In other words, it meant that the next shot was already fully loaded. `
`Without turning around, his gun pointing right at Belphegor's chest, Rudolf grinned. `
`"......Not bad...... `
`...For a middle-aged man...!!" `
`"Don't look down on the generation that loves old Westerns, okay? `
`You brats don't know anything about the refinement of a lever-action." `
`Just like Rudolf, Kyrie was also confronting a demon stake in the first floor corridor. `
`"What a moron. `
`You could've just escaped with your husband. `
`You do know that was your final farewell just now, right...? `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*!" `
`"Don't worry. `
`This kind of thing is my husband's specialty. `
`I'm sure he'll come for me on a white horse soon. `
`Because he's never failed to come and save me when I'm in trouble. `
`...Not even when Asumu-san was around. `
`Heheh." `
`"Heheheheheheheh! `
`What a happy couple. `
`I'm jealous. `
`......I am Leviathan of Envy...! `
`Envy itself is my power. `
`My anger, my lifeblood!" `
`"I agree. `
`Envy is the source of a woman's power. `
`...And if that is power, I won't lose to a girl like you." `
`"Hahhahahahahahahahaha! `
`Imagine saying that to the one who governs envy! `
`You actually think I'd let you two be reunited...?!! `
`Ahhahahahaha, I'll give you a tragic farewell!!" `
`The arm Leviathan swung was trailed by a purple curve. `
`It was a magic blade that cut with the power of malice. `
`Kyrie blocked it with her gun. `
`...Even though the magic blade should have cut through the metal like butter, the "gun", with its extremely high magic resistance power, `
`was able to block the blade as easily as if it were a rolled up newspaper. `
`Rapidly, two times, three times. `
`It blocked all of them. `
`And, without missing the opening created when that purple curve took a swing upward, `
`Kyrie kicked Leviathan in the stomach with her heel. `
`Leviathan was knocked away like a lightly dancing feather. `
`...Before the demon stake's feet touched ground again... `
`Kyrie was already pointing her gun directly at Leviathan in midair. `
`From that position, the two women who had called envy a form of power met each other's gaze. `
`"...C-Can you do it? `
`Can you pull that trigger...?!!" `
`"I can be brutal when my husband isn't around." `
`"Owowowowowowow!!" `
`Rudolf tumbled down the staircase. `
`He'd been gradually cornered by Belphegor...and had been pushed back into the main hall they'd started from. `
`"......The Predecessor-sama's furniture is pretty good. `
`They aren't very flashy though!" `
`"{f:5:Beatrice}-sama...! `
`It isn't over yet, and it's dangerous to show yourself...!" `
`".........Don't tell me you're... `
`...Eva?" `
`"That used to be my name. `
`But it's different now, Rudolf." `
`"You don't have to tell me. `
`You're gonna say you're the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, right?" `
`"Ehheheheheh, ahhahahahaha! `
`How did you know?" `
`"...Since the time Rosa was killed, I had a vague idea. `
`......Rosa, forgive me. `
`Forgive me for sending the sister you hated down to the hell you're in...!!" `
`"{f:5:Beatrice}-sama, look out!!!" `
`Rudolf mercilessly pointed the barrel of his gun at the witch who claimed to have once been his sister. `
`But Belphegor would not permit that and attacked savagely. `
`She dashed, disappeared, and headed for Rudolf's back... `
`...She dodged that shot and again headed for Rudolf's back... `
`...And vanished over and over, instantly moving into Rudolf's blind spots. `
`It was almost like she was a fairy. `
`As she blinked in and out of vision, Belphegor incessantly drove towards Rudolf. `
`"Maybe this is kinda fun. `
`Rudolf, let me sit back and watch to see how long your brave efforts last you. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!" `
`At that time, there was a dull tearing sound, along with Rudolf's cry of anguish. `
`Rudolf's reaction to the dance of the purple curve that pressed upon him had finally been too slow, `
`and he'd let it lightly cut his flank. `
`That single wound slowed him down just once. `
`That led to a new wound, which slowed his actions again. `
`Belphegor's dance began to swallow Rudolf whole... `
`Watching Rudolf's body gradually get carved up, his former sister let out a shrill laugh. `
`Leviathan could no longer hide her irritation that Kyrie hadn't suffered a single fatal wound. `
`"......I really am a moron. `
`...Among the Seven Sisters, I was always the slowest to grow. `
`I was always slow, always weak, always stupid." `
`"...That inferiority complex became envy, `
`and when I convert that into power, I gain a strength greater than that of any of the sisters." `
`"It's important for young girls to have a moderate inferiority complex. `
`It teaches women about cosmetics and hard work." `
`"I don't like having to use the limits of my power against mere Humans, `
`...but I can turn my envy of your ability to trust completely in your husband into power." `
`"...I don't like it. `
`Why are you so relaxed when you're fighting for your life?" `
`"...*giggle* `
`I wonder?" `
`"......I get it. `
`You're fully convinced that your husband will come to your rescue and save you. `
`......Isn't it incredible, that trust of yours? `
`It's enough to make me jealous." `
`What kind of trust did we sisters have for each other? `
`The sisters are always looking down on each other, trying to thoroughly lambast each other when things already look bad...! `
`"I've always been bullied by my sisters. `
`I've always wanted just one person to take my side. `
`...So when I see you with a single ally who's completely trustworthy, `
`I feel the strongest envy..." `
`"......Aaah, that confident expression of utter belief in your husband...! `
`I can feel it giving me power...!! `
`......I might even surpass that. `
`The speed of sound!!!" `
`Leviathan turned herself into a stake, and the speed of her flight as she attacked was proportional to the strength of her envy. `
`"Since the day my sisters looked down on me, `
`I was jealous from the bottom of my heart of the other six, who grew quickly! `
`I was jealous for seven days and seven nights!! `
`You can see the power I gained as a result in my speed...!! `
`Die, Ushiromiya Kyrieeeeeeeeeeee!!!" `
`The demon stake exposed her true form, leaping about at a terrible speed. `
`The noise from her bouncing off the walls sounded like a machine gun. `
`By now, Kyrie probably couldn't tell if it was a single stake or a swarm of beetles flying and bouncing around. `
`Leviathan was over 100% certain of her victory, believing in it from the bottom of her heart...! `
`Then, Kyrie spoke with an unbelievably calm voice. `
`"......I was the one who went out with Rudolf-san first. `
`...Asumu-san blatantly cut in between us... `
`and shrewdly got pregnant." `
`"...I don't blame Rudolf-san. `
`That woman used her body as a weapon to seduce him, and then acted even more repulsively, `
`cornering Rudolf-san and forcing him to get engaged to her." `
`Asumu-san had been carrying Battler-kun. `
`And at the same time, I was also carrying a boy. `
`...As fate would have it, our delivery dates were on the same day. `
`"Then, Asumu-san gave birth to Battler-kun. `
`...But I had a miscarriage. `
`......I think about it, sometimes. `
`What if Asumu-san had had the miscarriage...and I had been the one to give birth? `
`...Would Rudolf-san have broken off his engagement and married me? `
`...But I couldn't give birth to my child. `
`So until Asumu-san died, `
`and until I got pregnant with Ange, I cursed Asumu-san and was jealous." `
`Let Asumu-san die. `
`Then, I want him to marry me. In my envy, I kept cursing like that, over and over, until Asumu-san finally died. `
`I was certain. `
`I was certain that I'd used the power of magic to curse and kill Asumu-san. `
`But that didn't quell the flames of my envy. `
`Don't tell anyone, okay? `
`Every time I look at Battler-kun, I remember that woman. `
`Every single time I look at him, `
`...I think that if only my child had been born, he would be the same age. `
`I'm still jealous of her, tormented by her. `
`Even now, and from now on. `
`Into the future, for all eternity. `
`"You say you were jealous of your sisters for seven days and seven nights...?" `
`"...Th-That's right..." `
`Don't make me laugh, little girl. `
`".........How could you understand the madness of a woman... `
`and who's burned with envy for 18 years...?!!" `
`"U‐......uoawa{0}aaa{0}aAAa{0}a{0}aaAA{0}AAHHH!!!!" `
`If Leviathan had the power of 24 hours x 7 days, or 168 hours of speed... `
`Then the power that Kyrie had accumulated... `
`was 24 hours in 1 day, `
`365 days in 1 year, `
`and 18 whole years... `
`Even without counting leap years, `
`that was 157680 hours. `
`...Compared to Leviathan's power and speed, `
`it was more than 938 times greater. `
`So then, even if Leviathan could soar at the speed of sound, 1225 km/h, `
`...to Kyrie's eyes, it only looked like `
`1/938 of that. `
`So then, so then, 1225/938 is... `
`...a speed of... `
`1.30 km/h. `
`...They say a human's walking speed is 4 km/h, so it was even less than half of that. `
`This is almost the same speed as a baby crawling on the floor. `
`Which means, which means, which means...! `
`In the time it took the demon stake to move at a pace so slow that you could count all the bits of dust floating through the air, `
`Kyrie looked at it with pity. `
`She pitied the slowness at which it came towards her. `
`Then, she lazily raised the barrel of her gun. `
`Almost as though she was trying to swallow the demon stake up with the gun barrel. `
`"You're completely lacking in both love and envy." `
`...Try harder next time, little girl." `
`"Rudolf, what happened to all that vigor from a couple seconds ago? `
`You're supposed to slice up a fish while it's still flopping around. `
`After it dies, it isn't interesting anymore. `
`That's enough. `
`Why not kill you now?!" `
`"......Nng, ...damn it..." `
`"I'm surprised you managed to endure this long after being carved up. `
`...That's enough. `
`From now on, you don't need to think about anything. `
`I'll steal away your life painlessly...!" `
`"Wait, ...there's a favor I wanna ask. `
`At the very end, I wanna do one of those..." `
`"...What do you mean, one of those?" `
`"You know, that thing you see in all the Westerns. `
`We start with our backs together, walk three steps, and then *bang*." `
`"......Ah, a duel. `
`Very well. `
`If that will satisfy your regrets in this world, I'll accept." `
`Rudolf moved his wound-covered body and turned his back to her. `
`Belphegor responded and turned her back to his. `
`...Belphegor had an honest nature that was uncommon in a witch's furniture. `
`"Let me warn you. `
`Even if you press the barrel of your gun between my eyebrows, `
`I can move instantaneously, even faster than you could pull the trigger and have the bullet reach my skull." `
`"...Yeah, I can feel that already. `
`...You're faster than a bullet." `
`"I have agreed to this out of respect for your courage in challenging me to a duel despite that knowledge. `
`Thank me." `
`"...Well, you're an honest and principled person. `
`And a good woman. `
`You might just steal my heart away." `
`"Let's begin. `
`Three steps will do fine, yes? `
`......First, one step." `
`"...Two steps." `
`"...Three steps. `
`Is that okay?" `
`"Yep. `
`...And, since you still haven't noticed after walking three whole steps, `
`...it's my victory, miss." `
`"What...?! `
`............Ah...!" `
`Rudolf turned around and fired a bullet. `
`...However, Belphegor could easily see through the speed and trajectory of a bullet like that. `
`It should have been no problem at all to dodge it. `
`But a spray of fresh blood flew about. `
`...Belphegor had set up an adequate magical defensive barrier. `
`But before an incarnation of anti-magic power such as that bullet, it was completely meaningless. `
`"......What are you doing? `
`Why'd you get hit...?!" `
`The bullet had hit Belphegor right in the chest. `
`...The pain from the lead caused her to grimace, as did the pain from the denial of magic... `
`"...Forgive me. `
`I'm a coward of a man." `
`"..................ku‐ `
`...ggghh..." `
`"Wh-What a killjoy. `
`To think that furniture of a witch could be defeated by a Human...! `
`Know your shame. `
`Worthless, pathetic...! `
`If only you'd just grovel and die!!" `
`"......Quit it, Aneki. `
`...She could've dodged it. `
`But she didn't." `
`"...She realized that you were in the line of fire, Aneki. `
`So this faithful girl took it without dodging, protecting you. `
`At the very end, she saw that I was pinning the rook and the king." `
`"...S-Spectacular......" `
`"Don't hate me for it. `
`...I planned to resign if you noticed it while you were taking those three steps." `
`"............You made those three steps... `
`out of consideration... `
`...for me, didn't you...? `
`......I didn't even try to think about it. `
`...I... `
`was... `
`lazy......" `
`"...You were a good woman. `
`Go to heaven before me and get yourself all made up. `
`I'll definitely come and chat you up." `
`As Belphegor slowly fell over, ...she lost even the power that kept her in human form, `
`and she grew small, like gold dust, melting into thin air... `
`At that point, Kyrie dashed in. `
`It seemed that she had somehow defeated her pursuer by her own hands. `
`As she pointed the barrel of her gun straight at the witch, she ran up to the wound-covered Rudolf. `
`"...Are you okay? `
`Were you chatting someone up just now?" `
`"Yep, a good woman. `
`...No match for you, of course. `
`......Sorry, Aneki. `
`It's checkmate." `
`The two of them pinned the witch down the barrels of their guns. `
`"......Worthless furniture. `
`...To think they'd be beaten by Human opponents. `
`...Worthless. `
`Stupid. `
`...Boring...!" `
`"{f:5:Beatrice}-sama, we should retreat for now. `
`...There is no furniture or barrier to guard against bullets here." `
`"Eheheheh, `
`...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!" `
`The witch began to let out a muffled laugh. `
`...It surprised not only Rudolf and Kyrie, but Ronove as well. `
`......Because a situation like this, with two guns pointed at her, `
`was not one that even a witch could just laugh off. `
`But the witch laughed with pleasure. `
`"......Well, it's only natural that the Predecessor-sama's worn out furniture couldn't do it. `
`...I need to get new furniture that's suitable for me. `
`I used them out of obligation, `
`...but I've always hated second-hand stuff." `
`As she said that, she looked down at Belphegor's remains, which had already finished turning into a pile of gold dust, with disgust. `
`"I don't know what you're talking about. `
`Be a good girl and put your hands up." `
`...Then, the witch obediently raised her hands. `
`But instead of raising her hands because a gun was being pointed a her, `
`it looked more like she was a conductor facing an orchestra, waving her conductor's baton. `
`"Come, arise, furniture suitable for me...!! `
`Not that cheap furniture, much stronger ones! `
`Cruel ones!! `
`Ahhahahahahahahahahahahyahhyahhya!!!" `
`"Stop this bizarre act...! `
`I'll pull the trigger..." `
`In response to the witch's call, the hall was once again buried with the color of gold. `
`As the brilliantly radiant gold butterflies danced, `
`...it felt as though they were being sucked into an ocean of gold leaf. `
`Ronove was shocked at that upsurge in magical power... `
`After all, it far surpassed that of his former master. `
`As their eyes were dazzled amidst this golden flash, a gunshot could be heard. `
`Either Rudolf or Kyrie had fired a round. `
`...Then, when the golden flash subsided, at the very least the witch was standing there, looking cool and composed. `
`The bullet? `
`Kyrie must have fired it into her. `
`But the witch had not been hit anywhere on her body. `
`There it is. `
`...The bullet had been fastened in midair right in front of the witch's chest. `
`"...A-A bullet-proof barrier......!" `
`In an instant, a barrier that would require a significant amount of preparation even for the Predecessor had been... `
`Ronove's face was twisted in shock. `
`And, the surprises did not end there... `
`The cloud of gold butterflies had created two humanoid forms. `
`...It was a furniture summoning. `
`The butterflies peeled off and flew away, and beneath them, furniture in the shape of girls showed themselves. `
`".........The Chiester Sisters Corps... `
`......Even the Predecessor... `
`...wasn't able to summon Pendragon's Memorial Troops on a moment's notice, and to do it so easily...!" `
`"Chiester 410. Riiight here." `
`"Chiester 45. Right here." `
`"...You two are suitable furniture for me, I take it?" `
`"From reading a picture book out aloud, to going on a date, to shooting down meteorites, `
`we'll take care of anything. Nihihi." `
`"I-If we don't take care of it, Pendragon-sama will get mad at us...! `
`Please, your orders, Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}!" `
`"......Rudolf-san, `
`let's run for it. `
`We're no match for these ones...!" `
`"...S-Sure!" `
`Kyrie definitely heard warning sirens going off in her head, `
`thanks to the same feeling that had alerted her to the ambush by the Seven Sisters of Purgatory. `
`Without hesitation, they escaped. `
`As the witch elegantly watched them leave, she commanded her new furniture. `
`"...This is an order. `
`Kill the two who ran away. `
`Then bring the corpses back here. `
`I'll bring 'em back to life and play with them over and over. `
`...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!" `
`The witch's expression twisted into an evil smile. `
`Even though she feared that expression, Lucifer appeared and spoke. `
`"F-Forgive my presumption, `
`...but the Predecessor-sama asked that you avoid brutal actions of that sort..." `
`When the witch stared at her with those terrifying eyes, Lucifer was struck dumb. `
`...She was frustrated. `
`It was so boring, not being able to let her own power and cruelty run wild. `
`...This annoying furniture of the Predecessor kept telling her to show restraint, bringing her irritation to a peak. `
`"Oh, it's Lucifer of Pride. `
`Long time no see nyeh, how ya doin'? `
`Let's play together again sometime. `
`Nihhihihihihihi!" `
`"Y-You mustn't whisper, 410, you'll get in trouble...! `
`Let us carry out the Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}'s order at once...!" `
`"Nihi. `
`Well, yeah, we are on the job right now nyeh. `
`...410, roger that. `
`Preparing for Sniping Pursuit Combat." `
`"Accumulating Terrain Data, Accumulating Data for Firing. `
`Data Link with 410." `
`"410, Data Received. `
`Target Lock Acquired. `
`Commencing Terrain Calculation Error Correction. `
`Formulating Firing Curve, Supplemental Control Point Calculations Complete. `
`Data Link to 45." `
`"45, Data Received. `
`Checking Hazard Zone...ah, that's no good!" `
`"Lucifer-chan, better get out from behind us, `
`or you'll get roasted by the backblast. Nihi!" `
`"......Nng..." `
`Thanks to their paired measurements, `
`the Chiester Sisters were able to instantly calculate the terrain throughout the mansion and the coordinates of their targets, as well as a firing curve to reach them. `
`...That's right, their shots could be guided to follow a curved line. `
`None could escape. `
`The precision guidance used by the Seven Sisters of Purgatory was nothing more than a cheap knockoff of the ability these two held. `
`"45, Firing Preparations Concluded. `
`Ammo Type Selected and Loaded." `
`As the two of them faced each other, `
`it was as though they were both pulling back a bowstring together... `
`...A dazzling gold arrow was readied there. `
`"410, nihi. `
`Firing." `
`After giving that announcement, they released a single arrow together. `
`As the path taken by the gold-sparkling snake of light drew a curve, `
`it followed the direction that Rudolf and Kyrie had escaped to in rapid pursuit. `
`It turned through the corridors, crawled over the floor, chasing them as it drew a beautiful curve. `
`No one could block the guided shots of the Chiester Sisters. `
`No one could escape from them. `
`And their strength could pierce all physical and magical defenses. `
`...It was quite a merciless guided weapon of certain death. `
`However, among mythical-class soldiers, it was a weapon used by pretty much everyone. `
`It was very commonplace for them...and very extraordinary for those of the everyday world. `
`"Wh-What the...?!" `
`When he noticed something rapidly chasing them and turned around... `
`The exact position of Rudolf's heart was pierced by the gold snake. `
`It all happened in an instant. `
`"R-Rudolf-san...?!" `
`After the gold snake pierced Rudolf, `
`it swooped down to the floor, drawing a beautiful spiral, coiled itself around Kyrie's legs, and crawled up to her chest. `
`And just like Rudolf, it pierced the exact location of her heart. `
`...And all of that happened in an instant. `
`It pierced Rudolf, and then Kyrie. `
`So they died, dropped to their knees, and fell over at almost the exact same time. `
`"...What's thiiis? `
`Talk about overwhelming, ahhahahahahahahahahahahaha! `
`Ridiculously easy, isn't it? `
`Kuhhihihyahyahyahyahya! `
`This is the kind of furniture I need. `
`Way different from Predecessor-sama's second-hand furniture!" `
`"Come on, bring their corpses here. `
`I'll keep reviving them until I'm bored, and I'll try killing them in as brutal a way as I can think of. `
`Aaah, to think being a witch could be so much fun, `
`that taking a life could be so much fun, ahhahahahahahahahahahaha!" `
`...From the time humans are born, the most shunned action they can take is the murder of another human. `
`It's only natural that humans can't understand how pleasurable it can be to break this taboo. `
`...But she was no longer a Human. `
`She was a witch. `
`...And there were some pleasures that only witches could understand. `
`By now, she had tasted those pleasures...and was totally immersed in them. `
`...After learning that the contents of the forbidden pot were honey, she could no longer live without them. `
`...No, maybe the contents were honey because they were forbidden. `
`Anyway, by killing Humans gruesomely, `
`and doing it over and over, she could feel the drug-like pleasure even now. `
`As the witch rolled over laughing, `
`the gold snake that had just been shot returned as though being reeled in. `
`At the tips, two people were pinned and dragged along. `
`The witch's order had been fulfilled. `
`...Rudolf and Kyrie had been killed instantly, and their corpses had been carried back. `
`"Chiesters 45 and 410, Order Execution Complete. `
`We await your next order, Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`Please, your orders...!" `
`"From babysitting, to playing online games with you, `
`to shooting down a space shuttle, we'll take care of everything. `
`Nihihi!" `
`"......It looks like these two are the sacrifices for the fourth and fifth twilights. `
`So in the end, I'll need those worthless Seven Sisters... `
`or are they the Five Sisters now? `
`I need those guys to pierce and gouge the forehead and the chest." `
`"...But I can do that at the very end, and I'm free to play in any way I want until then, right? `
`Heheheheheheheheheh!" `
`"Wait wait wait waait. `
`...Have you already forgotten what I've told you?!" `
`"Oh, it's you, Predecessor-sama. `
`Do you have any complaints?" `
`"Of course I do...! `
`You're doing whatever you please, aren't you?! `
`Why haven't you followed my directions?!" `
`"What's wrong with doing as I please, Predecessor-sama? `
`Anyway, I don't plan on deviating from the rules of the ceremony in the slightest." `
`"I'll definitely clean these two corpses up later and drive stakes into their forehead and chest." `
`"I'm telling you, that is not the problem...! `
`If you act so undignified and cruel... `
`umm, some people might take it badly..." `
`"............ `
`...You mean your opponent in that game, the one you're supposedly fighting against somewhere? `
`Ronove told me." `
`"...D-Damn that blabbermouth. `
`......Well, to be perfectly honest, that's how it is. `
`If you go a little too far...umm, `
`...that person will object, you see?" `
`"Why can't this person just complain to me directly, instead of making you take a message? `
`...That coward." `
`"......Well, this is a resident of a different world from yours. `
`There's no choice but to use me as an intermediary. `
`Well, that's beside the point but-" `
`"......... `
`...Which means that this person couldn't interact with me even if they wanted to. `
`And I can't interact with them even if I want to either. `
`Simply put, this is a completely unrelated person from a world that distant, right?" `
`"I-Indeed. `
`...For example, perhaps you could say these worlds are like very close parallel lines. `
`The distance between them is quite small, but because the lines are parallel, they will never cross. `
`For now, that should be a convenient way for you to view that world." `
`"They never cross. `
`Which means... `
`...that world has nothing to do with me. `
`...If you're speaking for that person when you tell me to show restraint, please pass this message on to them." `
`"To them? `
`What should I say...?" `
`"It's none of your business, so disappear, you old hag. `
`If only you'd just give up and die..." `
`".........Wha..." `
`"...Oh, I'm sorry. `
`Since it was a friend of yours, I just assumed she'd be a woman. `
`By "old hag", I'm definitely not talking about you, Predecessor-sama, so please don't get mad at me. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!" `
`When she spoke, the witch was looking straight into Beato's eyes. `
`...Anyone present would be able to tell what she meant by it. `
`"......Predecessor-sama, `
`there's something I find really strange. `
`...Why do you have to play a game with someone from another world... `
`and have him accept that you're a witch?" `
`"Well, as to that, `
`...it's because making all humans accept the existence of witches is a prerequisite of perfect control. `
`There was a single holdout who simply wouldn't accept me as a witch." `
`"......Why would you need the approval of a Human? `
`Witches are witches and can use magic, so why should we need to be acknowledged by Humans?" `
`"...Nnn...... Well, like I said earlier, magic is..." `
`"I am a witch. `
`I can use magic without anyone's approval in particular, so what's your point...?" `
`"In this world, right? `
`However, since that person won't accept it, umm, `
`...nnnnn, how should I explain it..." `
`"...I don't need you to. `
`After all, isn't all this about a different world that never crosses this one? `
`In other words, that world might as well not exist." `
`"......You fighting a game in another world is absolutely no different from you telling me about stuff from your imagination. `
`...I'll say it again. `
`It has nothing to do with me. `
`And, I am already a witch." `
`"Predecessor-sama, somehow or another, it seems that you can't become a witch as long as this person doesn't acknowledge you, but I'm different. `
`Even though no one has acknowledged me, I'm an excellent witch already. `
`......Since you are my predecessor, I will formally pay you respect, `
`but that's out of kindness, not out of duty." `
`"...I won't ask for your advice anymore... `
`because I clearly know what I should do and how I should play from now on." `
`"......So I will carry out the murder of 13 people as a final act of respect for you. `
`However, there is absolutely no reason for you to interfere with the methods I use... `
`or what I do afterwards. `
`.........Therefore, I'll be counting on you in that regard." `
`At a glance, those words seemed obedient, but they contained within them a clear parting of ways. `
`...She was no longer under Beato's care in any way. `
`That's why she was clearly saying nothing more than "Don't get in the way of my fun". `
`Beato understood that... `
`and was dejected, realizing that no matter how she explained it, she wouldn't be able to make the witch understand. `
`"...I......I see... `
`Then it is no longer my problem... `
`Go and learn with your own body how magic ceases to exist when you lose your respect for it." `
`"...I wish you'd tell me where the respect was `
`in that carefree rampage of yours up until now." `
`After hearing that, Beato could not respond. `
`...Because she remembered hearing exactly the same thing from her teacher. `
`"Okay now. `
`Chiester Sisters? `
`See off my predecessor on her way back." `
`"Nihihihihi. `
`Predecessor-sama, please leave this place." `
`"I-If you don't, we'll be scolded...!" `
`Throughout her body, Beato felt something unseeable from the Chiester Sisters...which could only be described as an oppressive sensation. `
`...Most likely, they were initiating firing calculations. `
`It was an action much like taking out a gun and cocking it. `
`Even Beato could not escape from the Chiester Sisters' attacks without any preparation. `
`...In the past, she had placed her greatest trust in them, so she knew how terrifying they were down to her very soul. `
`"......Predecessor-sama, if you would retire. `
`......I would not recommend damaging {f:5:Beatrice}-sama's mood any further." `
`"...Predecessor-sama..." `
`"...I-I understand. `
`...I shall leave for now. `
`...I'll watch over the end you eventually reach at my leisure!" `
`It was almost infinitely close to a parting shot. `
`...So, after Beato vanished, the witch and her furniture doubled over laughing... `
`"......Well, I do understand. `
`The endless power is fun. `
`...The joy of freely toying with an extremely limited life cannot be explained to those who have not tasted it. `
`...I can understand that feeling of being possessed with a pleasure similar to drugs." `
`"...It must have been quite fun, `
`judging by your antics in the past." `
`"Are you saying...it's just like when you tried to admonish me in the past, over and over, and I did not listen...?" `
`"......Why have you started trying to scold that child for her actions?" `
`"Nnn, ...umm, well. `
`........." `
`"...There's a single large difference between you and that child. `
`That child may already be a witch. `
`Of course, you are also a witch. `
`...At least, in the world on top of the game board." `
`"...However, to be acknowledged as a witch in the world outside the game board, `
`you need to have Battler-kun, your opponent in this game, acknowledge you. `
`...You must have understood that when you started the game." `
`"...I thought that if I could show off a whirlwind of proof that I am a witch, `
`blow away his desire to deny me, and make him surrender, `
`......he would acknowledge me as a witch. `
`...It all went my way last time, so I thought I was just a breath away..." `
`"It's actually the opposite. `
`Battler-kun was disgusted by your brutality. `
`He did not step up to the plate as a player because he acknowledged you as a worthy opponent. `
`It was based on a strong animosity, his resolve to completely deny the existence of a brutal witch." `
`"......In your foolishness, you probably felt that Battler-kun's acceptance of his role as your opponent was a first step `
`towards making him acknowledge you as a witch. `
`However, it was actually the opposite." `
`"Battler-kun challenged you in this game because he was absolutely determined not to acknowledge you. `
`...No matter how hard the thoughtless north wind blows, the traveler only wears his cloak even tighter. `
`You were committing a huge error from the very beginning." `
`"......This game is not torture to make Battler-kun surrender. `
`It is a test, in which you must try to make Battler-kun accept you." `
`"...... `
`...Uu... `
`...I've vaguely... `
`noticed that..." `
`"The last game was a tough one for Battler. `
`But, as it seems you've already noticed, `
`...this game is a tough one for you." `
`"Wh-What should I do from now on?" `
`"Think about it for yourself. `
`...Fortunately, you have already given up your pieces on the game board to the new witch. `
`You should have plenty of time to reflect upon your own self." `
`"......But Battler's already a mass of hostility to me. `
`He won't accept witches, so he won't accept me. `
`...In that case, what can I do to make him accept me...? `
`Are you saying that if the north wind doesn't work, ...then I should shine on him as the sun from now on...? `
`Me, after all this time...?" `
`"It's October now. `
`The Halloween season. `
`......It's the month of rebirth, when the sun dies and is revived again. `
`When the sun is weak right after reviving, it may not reach far through the cold winter winds." `
`"However, it slowly grows...and is eventually able to hail the coming of spring. `
`...At that time, the traveler may even fold up his cloak." `
`"......Are you saying... `
`that I've been mistaken......?" `
`...The beautiful hall of the Ushiromiya mansion was covered with a golden sparkle like gold leaf... `
`and stained deep red with thick spurts of blood. `
`The number of deaths given to Rudolf and Kyrie had long surpassed anything you could count on both your fingers and your toes. `
`The witch was breathing so hard her shoulders shook, but it wasn't because she was tired. `
`...She just couldn't hide her ragged breaths caused by her still uncontainable excitement. `
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahahhahahahaha!! `
`How fun it is to do as I will with people's lives and deaths! `
`With the power of the Endless Witch, the endless everything I paint with my mind becomes reality! `
`No matter how sloppily I mash them, `
`I can revive them, returning them to normal with just a snap of my fingers. `
`Because in the end, I just have to restore the corpses and follow the epitaph as an afterthought. `
`Ahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!" `
`"...Hey, you guys, `
`have you ever sliced a stuffed animal's stomach open?" `
`"Never, nihi. `
`What about you, 45?" `
`"N-No...! `
`I have never done it, my apologies...!" `
`"That's understandable. `
`Normally, you wouldn't. `
`Especially not if it was a stuffed animal you liked. `
`But I've always thought about it." `
`"I always thought about peeking in... `
`and seeing what was packed inside this fluffy stuffed animal I loved." `
`If you cut it and looked inside, your curiosity might be quelled, but the stuffed animal would be broken. `
`...So, even though you want to see, you can't. `
`You understand that feeling, right? `
`"...The power of the Endless Witch can truly grant that wish. `
`...As I am now, I can slice the stuffed animal all I want." `
`"...And yet, with a bit of magic, I can return it to normal and revive it. `
`...In other words, it means I've broken all limitations in this world. `
`...As I am now, I don't have to hesitate or give up an idea or anything." `
`"That joy...aah, there's probably no one who can understand it. `
`No one other than me, the Golden Witch!!" `
`As the witch let out a mad war cry, she revived Rudolf and Kyrie again, `
`and faster than they could realize it, she killed them right away. `
`...And she made it known that something other than cotton was stuffed inside those two. `
`"...Q- `
`Quit it, Eva...!" `
`"Huh? `
`...Ah, it's you. `
`How long have you been there?" `
`In that gruesome hall, Hideyoshi appeared with his gun readied. `
`The witch had sealed the mansion with a barrier, so Hideyoshi had nowhere to run. `
`...He'd probably picked up Rudolf's or Kyrie's gun and come back. `
`The gun, which should have been something to be feared, was apparently no longer an object she took seriously now that she was overflowing with magical power. `
`Her bold expression didn't flinch in the slightest. `
`"......Why did you have to kill Rosa-san and Maria-chan, `
`...and Rudolf-kun and Kyrie-san...?!" `
`"Huh? `
`I am the Head of the Ushiromiya family, the witch of Rokkenjima. `
`Everything that occurs on this island is all up to me. `
`...Whether they happen to be alive or dead at any particular moment in time is meaningless to me." `
`Hideyoshi was struck speechless by that all‐too‐callous response from the witch. `
`"...You went mad after finding Father's gold...! `
`Just how high must that gold have been piled? `
`I can't even imagine it. `
`It must have been enough to steal away your sanity..." `
`"...But if there was that much gold, `
`...why didn't you think of graciously splittin' it up...?!!" `
`"You misunderstand. `
`......All of that belongs to the Golden Witch. `
`No one is qualified to touch it except me. `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle* Ahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!" `
`"...What are you? `
`Don't tell me you're that thing Eva told me about long ago, ...the witch Eva from when she was young?" `
`"That's right. `
`I am the "me" from my years as a girl, who's been living in the heart of your wife, Ushiromiya Eva, this whole time. `
`...And I'm a witch. `
`......Eva became an adult by forgetting me. `
`So she can't use magic." `
`"...All kids get their heads filled with innocent but cruel ideas sometimes. `
`When I was young, I'd sometimes go around steppin' on ants and pullin' the wings off dragonflies. `
`......However, I learned the importance of life, and graduated from that cruel childhood age." `
`"...Right now, you really are a child! `
`...A personality that I know Eva graduated from! `
`That personality isn't Eva. `
`It's a completely different human!!" `
`"That's right. `
`I am not Ushiromiya Eva. `
`I'm the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`It's so fun, not being bounded by any limitations, and the pleasure of being able to do as I will with life and death is truly wonderful...! `
`I don't have to apologize for breaking a goldfish bowl, `
`and I can tear stuffed animals up as much as I want! `
`I-" `
`There was a crisp sound. `
`...It was the sound of Hideyoshi slapping the witch's face. `
`Looking at the hall stained deep red with fresh blood, he should have been able to imagine how terrible the witch was. `
`But without fear, without even hesitating, Hideyoshi had walked determinedly up to her and hit her on the cheek. `
`"............!" `
`"You dolt!! `
`Don't act like you're cruel, not when you're really a coward and a weakling! `
`I'll correct that evil nature of yours again if I have to!! `
`You fool! `
`Fool!!" `
`"Ow, `
`...ouch, `
`...hey...!" `
`"You're a woman who understands how important, how fragile a life is, aren't you?! `
`I'll make you remember...!! `
`What are you calling a "witch", you stupid fool?!! `
`You're my wife, Ushiromiya Eva! `
`If anything, you're witch of the kitchen, who can always make the perfect snacks out of refrigerator leftovers in a flash!! `
`Won't you open your eyes, you fool...?!!" `
`"Didn't I just tell you... `
`that I'm not Ushiromiya Eva...?!" `
`"You stupid fool!! `
`You! `
`You!!" `
`As tears dripped down his face, Hideyoshi kept hitting the witch's head. `
`He wasn't even pointing the gun at her anymore. `
`Therefore. `
`That sound of gunfire couldn't have come from the gun Hideyoshi was holding. `
`...The gun, which had fallen in the corner near Rudolf's corpse, was floating in the air, `
`...and smoke lingered near the barrel. `
`And the bullet? `
`......A red stain was slowly spreading across the chest section of Hideyoshi's vest. `
`Even though his back was facing the barrel of the gun, ...the bullet had driven through Hideyoshi's chest. `
`".........E... `
`va...... `
`......uu..." `
`"...Like I said, I'm not Eva. `
`What a stupid, annoying man. `
`...You're a pain, so I'll switch the sacrifice of the sixth twilight to you. `
`...If only you'd just hidden under some bed shaking or something, I planned on letting you go. `
`...But no, you went to all the trouble of coming back. `
`You really are a stupid man." `
`*thunk*... `
`There was a dull sound as Hideyoshi fell to the floor. `
`Even though death would have allowed him to escape from that pain, he resisted until the last second, `
`and staring straight into the witch's eyes, ...he passed away. `
`Because he had died without closing his eyes, the witch didn't realize that he was dead for a short while... `
`and remained pinned by that gaze. `
`"Should we make this one a new toy and play? `
`Nihi." `
`At those words, the witch finally realized that Hideyoshi was dead. `
`"......Nng, ...yeah. `
`...Right, what'll we do..." `
`The Chiester Sisters waited for instructions. `
`On the inside, they imagined the sorts of even more brutal orders their master might give. `
`But the expression that rose to the witch's face looked as though she'd gotten over her excitement. `
`She looked down at Hideyoshi's face, which still had tears dripping down it... `
`"...It's such a killjoy, and it's all this guy's fault. `
`I'm done. `
`......Ronove, are you there?" `
`"Yes, right here." `
`"Take care of the cleanup. `
`...I'll bet the Predecessor-sama makes a fuss over this one. `
`Please make it clean enough for that old hag to accept. ...I guess I'll follow the rules of the ceremony, out of a sense of obligation to my Predecessor-sama. `
`Treat these three corpses as the fourth through sixth twilights. `
`Lucifer, it's your turn." `
`"Lucifer of Pride, right here." `
`"Dig into these three corpses and gouge them." `
`"...I-Into corpses?" `
`"That's right. `
`Got a problem with that?" `
`"N-No..." `
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory had their own sort of pride. `
`It was the pride of a hunter, the pride of gouging prey that they had brought down themselves. `
`...However, being told to gouge a corpse that someone else had brought down ran contrary to that sentiment. `
`Of course, the witch didn't mean it that way, but for the Seven Sisters, it was horribly humiliating. `
`...However, they had already screwed this up, with two of the Sisters defeated, so they had no right to question her. `
`Only Ronove appreciated this, and he rested his hand on her shoulder in understanding. `
`"...This is an order from {f:5:Beatrice}-sama. `
`Lucifer, carry these three and dispose of them in accordance with the etiquette of the ceremony. `
`Then, when you are done, lend me a hand with the cleanup." `
`"Certainly..." `
`The witch looked down upon Hideyoshi's corpse, as though implying that the now delicate atmosphere was all Hideyoshi's fault. `
`"......Stupid man. `
`And you didn't even have to die." `
`"Dear...!!! `
`Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!! `
`Dear, where are you?! `
`You're there, right? `
`Answer me!!" `
`The crash of a thunderbolt woke Eva from her nightmare. `
`If Hideyoshi had been gripping her hand at that time, her fearful heart would probably have been instantly healed. `
`However, Hideyoshi, who had supposedly sworn that he wouldn't leave even for a moment, was nowhere to be seen in the room. `
`"Dear, `
`...answer me, `
`......dear...!! `
`Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!" `
