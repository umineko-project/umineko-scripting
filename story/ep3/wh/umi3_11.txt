`"......This way? `
`...Go this way......? `
`They're...inviting me to go this way......" `
`...!!! `
`My heart leapt. `
`...Because there, ......gaping wide, ...was an opened mouth in the eerie darkness. `
`"...Wh-What's this...? `
`What is this...?!" `
`When I strained my eyes, peering into the darkness, I saw something that looked like a light switch. `
`...In addition, there was a switch with 'open' and 'close' written on it. `
`When I resolutely pushed the switch, `
`rough lights, like you'd find in a coal mine, turned on sporadically, `
`making a staircase that stretched underground come hazily into view... `
`Eerily enough, it looked even more gloomy with the lights turned on. `
`Near the light switch was that 'open and close' switch. `
`...It would probably open or close this, but if the open part happened to be broken, `
`I might be shut away in this creepy underground area for all eternity... `
`So for the time being, I didn't touch that switch, `
`...and as I readied my gun again, I slowly went down the stairs. `
`The ceiling was very high, so it didn't feel cramped. `
`On the contrary, it felt as though a cool breeze was blowing upwards, and that creepiness seemed to form a sort of aura... `
`As I readied my gun and carefully stared forwards, ...I descended the stairs... `
`The walls, the stairs, the lights...all of them were very old-fashioned. `
`...It was easy to suspect that this had been built back when the mansion had been constructed on this island. `
`There were cracks in the ceiling, and water clung to the walls, constantly dripping down. `
`That water fell into a gutter that had been set up alongside the stairs, then quickly and silently flowed into the underground darkness. `
`As though it was telling me to go faster... `
`The staircase kept turning back on itself. `
`I don't know how far down I've gone, but I think it's much deeper than one floor. `
`Eventually, ......a rough, metal door showed itself. `
`And there, characters had been written in a dark red paint. `
`...They had probably been written a long time ago. `
`— {p:1:On the tenth twilight, the journey ends, and you shall attain the power of the Golden Land's treasures, once and for the last time.} `
`My heart, which was already about to explode, jumped about even more as soon as I recognized those deep-red characters... `
`There's no mistake... `
`This is the last stop. `
`......Father's...Golden Land...!! `
`I calmed my throbbing heart, somehow regained my composure, and readied my gun again. `
`...But since, in the end, I couldn't open the door with my gun held in both hands... `
`...I lowered the gun, carefully hid my breathing, and opened the door... `
`".........Th-This place...is...?!" `
`My first impression when I saw the room... `
`was that it might be linked to one of the rooms in the mansion. `
`That's right, it had exactly the same atmosphere about it as the sealed VIP room on the second floor. `
`But this was underground, so there were no windows. `
`There was only the solemn light of a grand chandelier. `
`But even though it was dimly lit by the faint light, `
`the quality of the interior was more than enough to take your breath away. `
`A bed with a canopy, and a rocking chair that looked like it would be comfortable to sit in. `
`An extravagant sofa and carpet. `
`The room was like a dream every girl yearns for at least once... `
`And yet, since it was an underground hidden room with no windows, `
`it felt more like the hidden house of a witch. `
`I'd never swallowed the legend of Beatrice, witch of the forest. `
`However, ...after being shown this room, `
`...it certainly became hard to doubt that she actually had existed...... `
`and had lived in this room. `
`"......Is someone... `
`...there...?" `
`Even though I was completely shocked by this room, I carefully... `
`no, timidly searched the interior with my gun raised. `
`And, ...at the back of the room, I found it. `
`"......Eeek......" `
`My gasp came out strangely, like a bunny being choked. `
`...After all, ...after finding something like this, `
`...no one would be able to stop that kind of stupid voice from leaking out... `
`"It's here... `
`...I-It's really here...... `
`...Father's...gold...!!" `
`On the opposite side of the canopy bed, it was piled up in a massive heap... `
`It was a mountain, a mountain of gold ingots!! `
`Of course, they weren't piled up carelessly in a way that would damage the dignity of this room. `
`A beautiful scarlet satin weave was laid on the mountain of gold, `
`creating a beautiful three-colored mix between the red, the gold and the black of the deep darkness... `
`It was as though, when the witch slept on this bed, `
`the gold would be a respectful chamberlain waiting on her. `
`Nobly, refinedly, gracefully, beautifully. `
`It was attentively piled there with an imposing air... `
`When I tried to grab a single gold ingot, I was surprised at its weight. `
`...It was probably about 10 kilograms. `
`...Just this ingot would probably be worth more than 10 million. `
`The Ushiromiya family crest, the One-Winged Eagle, was lightly imprinted on it. `
`It was hard to tell whether it had worn away, or whether the impression had been made carelessly in the first place, `
`but it was certainly the crest of the One-Winged Eagle. `
`Just how many ingots were piled up there? `
`By doing a quick count here and there and judging by the height, there had to be a few hundred at least. `
`My mind's already gone blank, so I can't do the math well. `
`...Even a moderate guess would put it above several billion yen. `
`"That's right, ...of course... `
`...After all, there's 10 tons of gold, right...? `
`At the current value, that's more than 20 billion yen of gold...! `
`...I-I found it...before anyone else. ......I found it!! `
`Ahaha, wahahahahahahaha, ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!" `
`In front of the mountain of gold, I spread my arms and looked up at the ceiling. `
`A laugh without a trace of dignity flowed out from my entire body. `
`I had no intention of laughing in a weird way, `
`...but, but, I couldn't hold back the happy feeling that was flowing through me. `
`...My older brother probably wouldn't accept his loss just because I found this gold. `
`...But from now on, there would be no changing the fact that I had been the one to find it...! `
`To steal away the Headship of the family, some more subtle bargaining would probably still be required. `
`But after everything I've gone through until now, that's a completely trivial problem. `
`Even if I lose out on the Ushiromiya Family Headship, `
`...I already have 20 billion yen worth of gold!! `
`"Hahahaha, ahahahahaha!! `
`At times, I've thought that money is such a worthless thing. `
`I thought there were so many things in this world you can't buy with money. `
`...But now I see that's just a lie! `
`Just an excuse that the have-nots make for themselves!!" `
`"In front of this mountain of gold, I've finally realized something so obvious...!! `
`By using this money, I can give birth to all the happiness in this world! `
`With this money, my husband's company is already saved. `
`We will always be happy as a family. `
`And I can even leave a vast sum of money to George...!!" `
`"The rest of the relatives will eventually be ruined and disappear. `
`At that time, George will use this gold, `
`and just like Grandfather did, `
`he will revive the Ushiromiya family's lost honor. `
`...George is the true successor to the Ushiromiya family!!" `
`It happened!!! `
`My wish was granted!! `
`That dream I have wished for ever since I was born into this world as Ushiromiya Eva...has been granted completely at this very moment...!! `
`My husband and I will be happy for all eternity. `
`And I can also give my only son, George, eternal happiness!! `
`There's no way I'll waste it on foolish pleasures!! `
`My older brother has chewed the Ushiromiya family to bits, but George and I will revive it! `
`And that means I truly have succeeded the Ushiromiya Family Headship!! `
`"I was successful... `
`I did it, ...honey...and George... `
`...I...your mother...finally succeeded... `
`...No one will be able to threaten us now... `
`Aaaaaaahhh, waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!" `
`That's right, after this, never again will we be smothered by sad nights. `
`Congratulations, me. `
`Congratulations, Ushiromiya Eva. `
`...Right here, right now, the sad half of our life will have its heart's desire granted. `
`"It's all thanks to you... `
`I was given this chance because of your magic. `
`Because of that chance, I was able to make it here...!" `
`...Thank you. `
`But my magic wouldn't have been granted if we both didn't believe in each other. `
`So, it isn't just the power of my magic. `
`This is our victory. `
`Because of that, congratulations, `
`'us'. `
`"Thank you, me... `
`Thank you, Ushiromiya Eva... `
`...I'm glad I didn't give in before now. `
`I'm glad that I didn't drown in sorrow and forget to keep struggling... `
`......No, this is my magic. `
`Our magic! `
`Your magic was the real thing. `
`Beatrice, the witch of the forest, is nothing more than an illusion. `
`You are the real witch, a wielder of real magic. `
`...That's right. `
`Right now, you are the Golden Witch, Beatrice!!" `
`Eva decided to leave for the time being. `
`When she climbed the stairs again, trying to leave this secret place... `
`...She saw a creepy, swaying human shadow blocking her path, and her dreamlike state was blown away. `
`".........Who is it?!" `
`For an instant, ...she believed that the true master of this room, the real Beatrice, had appeared. `
`It seemed that the other person was also holding a gun. `
`The two of them were pointing guns at each other. `
`And eventually, they each realized who the other was... `
`"......Rosa......?" `
`"...Nee-san, `
`...what are you doing in a place like this...?" `
`"That's my line. `
`What business do you have in such a place?" `
`"...I shouldn't have given you that hint, Nee-san. `
`If I hadn't, I definitely would have been the first to reach this place. `
`......Too bad." `
`It seemed that Rosa knew where this staircase went...... `
`and what was waiting ahead of her. `
`"You should talk. `
`......Even though I reached this place before you." `
`"......I worried too much about the sweetfish river. `
`The sweetfish part didn't really matter that much at all, did it?" `
`"That isn't true. `
`It was an excellent hint, wasn't it? `
`Well, of course, maybe there was no need for it to be sweetfish. `
`...But when I heard that sweetfish are fish that go out into the sea, I was able to figure it out." `
`"...What's inside?" `
`"Why not see with your own eyes? `
`It definitely won't betray your expectations." `
`"...... `
`...Don't be afraid, Nee-san. `
`I never had any interest in who becomes the Head. `
`I don't even care about the Ushiromiya family name. `
`...Honestly, I actually feel good about you stealing the Headship from Krauss nii-san, `
`who was always swaggering around because of it." `
`"......Are you serious?" `
`"Of course. `
`I'm the outsider of the Ushiromiya siblings. `
`...Even if Father had named me as the next Head, `
`there's no way Nii-san would accept it. `
`I try not to have such naive dreams." `
`"............" `
`"Let me see too, Nee-san. `
`This proof of your victory. `
`...As long as I receive the proper portion that the siblings agreed upon, `
`I plan to proactively acknowledge you as the true victor in this 'game'." `
`"......If you shoot me, then you'll have this gold all to yourself, won't you?" `
`"The same goes for you. `
`If you shoot me, this gold will all be yours." `
`"............" `
`For a tense moment, the sisters pointed their guns at each other. `
`Eventually, after they sized up the glint in the other's eyes, they lowered their guns. `
`...Eva removed her finger from the trigger and held the gun upside-down. `
`It was a position that she couldn't quickly shoot from. `
`When she saw that, Rosa held hers the same way. `
`"...That's right. `
`That plan of shooting the other and having all the gold to ourselves is attractive for both of us. `
`...But if one of us suddenly disappeared on this island while it's isolated by the typhoon, there would be a huge uproar. `
`...If we hid the corpse here, it probably wouldn't be found easily, but we couldn't be sure." `
`"......No matter how many billion yen worth of gold is on the line, `
`it isn't worth the risk of committing murder. `
`On the contrary, that would give Krauss nii-san and the others ammunition to wring us for all we're worth." `
`"I agree. `
`...It may have been a blessing in disguise that you're the one who showed up... `
`instead of Nii-san or Rudolf. `
`...You're the sibling I trust most." `
`"......Thank you. `
`And you're the sibling I trust most, Nee-san." `
`"............" `
`"......I want to see the gold too." `
`"Wanna have a peek? `
`Now I feel like seeing it again too. `
`Even though I saw it with my own eyes, it still doesn't feel real. `
`...Unless I see it together with you and confirm once more that it actually exists, `
`it feels like the gold will turn to fog and disappear." `
`Eva started descending the staircase once more. `
`...However, she didn't carelessly expose her back to Rosa. `
`Even though, at a glance, it looked like Rosa had lowered her guard, she definitely didn't show any signs of carelessness. `
`...Then, they reached that room of the witch once more. `
`Rosa also gasped, stunned speechless by the vast amount of gold... `
`...Rosa and Eva walked absentmindedly through the rose garden. `
`They had left the guesthouse secretly, so they had to be careful when they returned. `
`It was time to snap to it and keep their guards up. `
`"...Congratulations, Nee-san." `
`"Thank you." `
`"You decided it, didn't you Nee-san? `
`50% goes to the one bearing the title of Successor to the Headship. `
`...It certainly worked out well for you. `
`Now, that portion isn't Krauss nii-san's. `
`...So your share is now 50%, along with a quarter of the rest, for a total of 12.5 billion yen." `
`"Isn't that incredible? `
`...2.5 billion is enough for me. `
`Rudolf nii-san won't complain either. `
`Krauss nii-san will probably be the only one to complain." `
`"...Yeah, you're right. `
`...After all, Nii-san is the de-facto manager of Rokkenjima. `
`And since the gold was on these premises, `
`even though I was the first to discover it, things might get complicated if I don't handle it cleverly." `
`"It won't get complicated. `
`Didn't we give it our all in that discussion last night with that in mind?" `
`"......I wonder if it will really go that smoothly. `
`I've already completely gotten over my excitement. `
`How we manage everything from here on is the real problem." `
`"...That's a problem for the new Head of the Ushiromiya family. `
`A problem for you to enjoy, Nee-san. `
`It has nothing to do with me." `
`"Heh, that's some big talk, coming from you..." `
`"...I'll support you as the second discoverer... `
`if you'll at least give me the early payment we decided on. `
`I'd like 150 million yen by March." `
`"Yes, that will be fine. `
`...If you support me, I'll graciously pay you that much. `
`I'm not Nii-san." `
`"Anyway, why don't we go and shock Nii-san and the others? `
`Even if we cover up the actual location, I want to see Krauss nii-san's shocked face as soon as I can." `
`"...... `
`......Wait a second, Rosa. `
`Wait a while before telling everyone about it." `
`".........Huh? `
`...Why?" `
`"...You idiot, isn't it obvious? `
`...This is that haughty Krauss nii-san and that sly Rudolf we're talking about. `
`Even if we do announce it eventually, it's certainly too early now." `
`"Unless we carefully investigate how to make our next move, `
`it's possible that all of the gold we've finally found will be snatched away by Nii-san." `
`Eva thought she was saying something extremely natural. `
`...So when she saw Rosa's expression suddenly cloud over, she was a little surprised. `
`"...What are you unsatisfied about? `
`You know what kind of a person Krauss nii-san is." `
`"...... `
`Nee-san, that's against the rules." `
`"What do you mean?" `
`"...Didn't we make a rule that whoever found the gold would announce it immediately? `
`If you hesitate, the foundation of the rules will be destroyed, `
`and that could lead to something worse in the future. `
`...With Krauss nii-san as crafty as he is, `
`that violation of the rules will come back to bite you." `
`"Don't be stupid. `
`This is Nii-san's island. `
`And that gold just now wasn't cash. `
`We're talking about the liquidation of a vast 10 ton mountain, right?" `
`"It will take a significant amount of time to carry it off and turn it into cash. `
`And that will only work in Nii-san's favor, since he has practical control over this island. `
`Don't you even realize that?!" `
`".........I don't like it when you search out each other's weaknesses like that. `
`All I want is to reach a clear decision regarding my 2.5 billion portion." `
`"Of course, if you were to give me 2.5 billion in cash right now, `
`you'd be free to continue negotiating however you like. `
`But until I have my share in my own pocket, I will follow the siblings' rules." `
`"How can you be so naive...? `
`You don't understand Nii-san's craftiness at all!" `
`...It wasn't that Rosa didn't understand the craftiness of her older siblings. `
`In that sense, Rosa more or less understood why Eva was being so cautious. `
`But in her heart, `
`she couldn't clear away her suspicion that Eva wanted to keep all of the gold to herself. `
`...Because she knew that Eva was at least as crafty as her other siblings. `
`In other words, Rosa wanted to put a stop to any chance Eva had to keep the gold all to herself... `
`by quickly informing the siblings of the gold's discovery... `
`"...... `
`...Rosa, `
`sorry, but at least listen to me this once." `
`"......Are you saying that if I don't listen to what you say, you won't be able to get me that 150 million?" `
`"...... `
`...That isn't the way I wanted to say it. `
`...But if you really need that money, supporting me is a more realistic option. `
`...If you talk to Nii-san and Rudolf, even the portion that's your natural right might disappear. `
`You don't want that, do you?" `
`"............" `
`For a while, a severe expression that she'd never shown to her sister before rose to Rosa's face. `
`There wasn't even a trace of her restraint as a younger sister. `
`...There was just the ruthlessness... `
`no, the seriousness of a single human arguing about a vast sum of wealth. `
`Eva made light of it, chuckling. `
`"...My, my. `
`How careless we must be to stand around here talking like this, `
`even though a frightful murder case has just taken place, and the culprit might still be on this island." `
`"I'm sure it was just the servants playacting. `
`There were no murders on this island in the first place." `
`"...Oh? `
`So, you do think that after all." `
`"The circumstances surrounding those six deaths shows us that clearly. `
`A crime from the outside couldn't possibly have created those six closed rooms." `
`"...Doctor Nanjo said they were all dead, but that was a lie too. `
`This is all a complicated act that Father cooked up. `
`All of the servants are just playing dead. `
`...A murder never occurred in the first place. `
`There's no way that there's a murderer prowling around." `
`"...Hah. `
`I'm surprised you noticed. `
`You looked pretty scared, so I didn't think you'd figured out so much." `
`"...I'm good at reading the mood of a situation. `
`I've got you to thank for training me so well." `
`That's right. `
`Come to think of it, now that the servants are 'dead', almost everyone on this island is a member of the Ushiromiya family. `
`As for Nanjo, he proclaimed the 'deaths' of the servants, `
`but when the relatives began to discuss the riddle of the epitaph, he disappeared off to the second floor as if he didn't want to get in the way... `
`"All of it... `
`was an act to get us to try and solve that epitaph. `
`...And that's why... `
`you need to announce that you're the victor, Nee-san." `
`"There's no way that burnt corpse was really Father. `
`...He got a corpse with the right number of toes from somewhere...and went to all the trouble of burning it in that creepy way of his, so we would see it." `
`"...I'm sure he's hiding somewhere, watching to see how we'll behave. `
`...I'll bet he already knows you reached the Golden Land, Nee-san." `
`"...That's why you should announce that you're the winner soon. `
`I'm sure Father will appear out of nowhere to applaud you and proclaim that you're his successor." `
`"........................" `
`"...Then again, `
`...I've still got to pester you for that 150 million, `
`so I can't stand against you in any way." `
`"......So you'll listen to what I say...and keep quiet about this to Nii-san and the rest...?" `
`"............" `
`"...Make your position clear, `
`...Rosa." `
`"......I want to tell them. `
`We made that rule just last night. `
`We shouldn't just throw it away." `
`"Of course, I will announce it in front of the siblings. `
`...However, I want to closely analyze the situation first. `
`We've got to carry out 10 tons of gold, convert it into money, `
`and distribute it fairly." `
`"...Until I have proof that I can do all that without Nii-san getting in the way, I want some time to think. `
`I only want to postpone my announcement until then. `
`......I'm certainly not keeping it secret because I want it all for myself." `
`"...... `
`...You'll definitely announce it to everyone sooner or later, right?" `
`"...Yes, of course. `
`Even I want to rub it in Nii-san's face as soon as I can." `
`"......About how much time will you need to think?" `
`"I won't know that until I've thought about it." `
`"......Will one night be enough?" `
`"I can't promise you that it'll take only one night...!" `
`"Out of respect for you, the Successor, I'll support you for one night. `
`...This year's family conference will end tomorrow morning, when the typhoon passes and a boat comes to get us. `
`...That's right, when the seagulls cry. `
`...I will remain silent until then." `
`"If you still feel that you need more time to think after that, ...then we'll cross that bridge when we get there, okay? `
`......I'll support your position `
`{i:to the best of my ability}." `
`"...............You...really are cunning, aren't you? `
`...I'm surprised. `
`Were you always this resilient?" `
`"...I guess it's true that women become stronger when they have a child. `
`I realized that in myself when I had Maria." `
`"...... `
`Understood. `
`For the time being, thanks for your cooperation. `
`...We can talk about tomorrow when it comes." `
`"Yes, that's right. `
`...I'm convinced that you'll become a fair-minded successor to the Headship, one who'd never even consider taking all of the gold for herself." `
`"...Isn't that obvious?! `
`...I will split the gold evenly among the siblings." `
`No way. I found it. `
`Because I...because we solved the riddle of the epitaph! `
`So this gold is all mine...!! `
`"I won't give it up to anyone! `
`I am the Head of the Ushiromiya family! `
`I am, 'I' am!!" `
`The witch inside Eva claimed exclusive possession in a loud voice. `
`...Of course, that didn't reach even close to Rosa's ears, and it probably didn't reach Eva's either. `
`"...Indeed. `
`I shall acknowledge it. `
`You are the true Head of the Ushiromiya family, chosen by the witch's epitaph. `
`Now, I acknowledge it upon my name." `
`"...Y‐ `
`You are......? `
`That outfit... `
`You couldn't... `
`actually be... `
`Beatrice...?" `
`Maybe Beatrice was happy that Eva had called her by her own name. `
`She cackled cheerfully. `
`In concert with that laugh, gold butterflies crept up as though a storm of gold dust was spinning around the room, `
`and the room shone the color of gold... `
`"Indeed. `
`I am the Golden Witch, Beatrice. `
`...*cackle*cackle* There is no need to be so frightened. `
`I am praising your exploits. `
`...Truly excellent. `
`Imagine that you would spectacularly solve that riddle of the epitaph... `
`It is worthy of my admiration...!" `
`"...You're the one who sent that letter? `
`So, I'll inherit all of the gold and the Ushiromiya Family Headship, right...? `
`You wrote that in your letter. `
`And I overcame that challenge...!" `
`"Indeed. `
`I shall acknowledge it. `
`Right now, all of the gold piled up here...and everything of the Ushiromiya family...is for you to do with as you please. `
`After all, from this moment on, you are already the Ushiromiya Family Head." `
`"...R-Really? `
`It's true, right? `
`Right?!" `
`"Do not be agitated. `
`I am openly praising you. `
`As proof, I shall grant you this." `
`Beatrice took a ring off of her own finger... `
`and held it out to Eva. `
`She fearfully accepted it... `
`...and realized that it was a ring. `
`"......C‐ `
`Could...... `
`this be......" `
`"Indeed. `
`This Golden Ring is proof of the Ushiromiya Family Headship, returned to me from Kinzo. `
`From now on, it is yours. `
`You may place it on your finger and hold it high before your siblings. `
`No one should doubt that you have now succeeded the Ushiromiya Family Headship." `
`Eva stared closely at the ring. `
`...It certainly wasn't a fake. `
`...Without a doubt, it was the real thing. `
`She'd dreamed of receiving this ring someday, `
`focused on this day over and over again, and it was now finally a certainty. `
`This ring... `
`had now designated her as the Head... `
`and had been handed over to her... `
`And... `
`timidly, `
`...she put it on the middle finger of her left hand... `
`In that instant, ...she felt a deep emotion welling up inside her that she'd never felt before. `
`Her mind grew blank. `
`Both eyes were opened. `
`That ring...was on her own finger. `
`Not in a dream, but in reality......! `
`"That ring is also pleased. `
`After all, it managed to reach you, one who dreamed of putting it on their finger for so long." `
`"...The ring... `
`...Father's... `
`...ring......!" `
`"How many nights have you dreamed of putting that on your finger as you have done now? `
`...The strength of those feelings became your magic and materialized itself. `
`Now, you are worthy of calling yourself a Great Witch." `
`"......W-Who are you? `
`...Are you really...Beatrice...?" `
`"*cackle*cackle* `
`I am the Golden Witch, Beatrice! `
`The Ushiromiya family alchemist! `
`In accordance with my contract with Kinzo, I will now pass everything on to you. `
`...All of the gold I entrusted Kinzo with. `
`And all of the wealth he built up through that. `
`And the honor and Headship of the Ushiromiya family. `
`And, I will pass on my power and the title of the Endless Witch." `
`"...The title... `
`of the witch..." `
`"I will pass on all of my magical power...and the titles of the Golden Witch and the Endless Witch. `
`...Following my Predecessor's example, I will hand over my name, Beatrice, along with that title. `
`...You may now call yourself by that name!" `
`Eva gulped. `
`The chandelier light, which had seemed dim, now felt too bright. `
`"By my name, I shall now commence the succession of the Golden Witch...!" `
`The instant Beatrice made that proclamation, everything was buried by a golden sparkle... `
`and changed into a majestic place that looked like an audience hall. `
`In the audience hall, there was a crowd of Beatrice's minions and brethren, `
`as well as countless gold butterflies celebrating this first succession ceremony in a thousand years. `
`When she looked, she saw Beatrice in the throne that only the Endless Witch was permitted to sit in, holding a golden staff, `
`reigning with a dazzling dignity. `
`Without being ordered by anyone, Eva automatically kneeled, hanging her head... `
`A goat attendant respectfully handed Beatrice a golden staff in the shape of the One-Winged Eagle. `
`After Beatrice stood up and received that staff, `
`she lay the tip of it on Eva's shoulder and spoke. `
`It was a proclamation one thousand years in coming. `
`"Ushiromiya Eva. `
`You have spectacularly solved the riddle of the witch's epitaph and reached the Golden Land. `
`...I praise that accomplishment... `
`and hand over all of the Endless Magic as well as the titles of the Golden Witch and the Endless Witch." `
`"From this point forth, you may call yourself by my name, `
`Beatrice...! `
`Come, raise your face. `
`Then stand and accept this staff...!" `
`"...I-I am most grateful..." `
`Eva stood up dizzily and took the magic staff from Beatrice's hand. `
`Her hand was trembling slightly. `
`As soon as she grasped that staff, `
`...she was wrapped up in the brilliant sparkle of gold. `
`As though gold butterflies were flowing out from inside of her. `
`In the instant she succeeded the Golden Witch, Eva felt something in the depths of her soul be reborn. `
`To describe it in a word, it was energy. `
`Energy with a gold color. `
`It felt like she was waking up, `
`...as though she had been half asleep ever since she had been born and was opening her eyes for the first time. `
`It felt as though her true eyes inside her eyes were opened for the first time in her life. `
`"......Indeed. `
`A fitting and beautiful outfit for the Golden Witch. `
`Come, you may show yourself to all of these people. `
`Let them know that the new witch is indeed you...!" `
`Eva...no, the new Beatrice turned around timidly. `
`When she did, the witch's minions, which filled the vast audience hall, `
`honored her with an applause that sounded like the roaring of the sea... `
`"Come, everyone. `
`Replace all of the portraits of Beatrice with the new Beatrice! `
`Lift up words of celebration for the new Beatrice...!!" `
`"New Beatrice, `
`congratulations on the succession of the Golden Witch. `
`...I hope that you will become able to stand on your own as a proud Golden Witch, and as the Endless Witch." `
`"...Y-Yes, ...I will do my best..." `
`"I expect a composure befitting the Endless Witch from you, unlike your naughty predecessor. `
`Hohohohohoho." `
`"Teacheer, we're in the middle of a serious ceremony, so please, enough of that." `
`"Congratulations on the succession of the Golden Witch, `
`new Beatrice-sama. `
`...I am called Ronove. `
`I am one of the 72 demons permitted to serve the Golden Witch." `
`"If you are ever inconvenienced in the slightest, `
`please let me know at once." `
`"...Th-Thank you..." `
`"Ronove is rude, but reliable. `
`If anything confuses you in your new days as a witch, speak to this man, and he should be able to help you." `
`"......Predecessor Beatrice-sama, `
`it is a shame that I was not permitted to serve you further, even though we have finally been reunited like this. `
`...These last thousand years have been very entertaining for me. `
`You have my deepest gratitude." `
`"Indeed. `
`...One thousand years with you wasn't boring. `
`...Please, take care of the new witch." `
`"Yes. `
`I, Ronove, `
`...will obey the final order `
`of the former Beatrice." `
`"You'd better thank me, okay? `
`I gave my signature to recommend you for the succession of the witch, got it? `
`In other words, if I hadn't signed, you wouldn't have been able to become a witch. `
`So thank me a little, okay?!" `
`"This is the Witch of Certainty, Lady Lambdadelta. `
`The recommendation of a witch from the senate was required for your succession as an Endless Witch. `
`Lady Lambdadelta recommended you and became your guardian." `
`"...Th-Thank you..." `
`"...Heeey, Beatooo! `
`This kid isn't grateful enough! `
`I think I'll take back that recommendation!" `
`"A person making these recommendations shouldn't act like a child, right? `
`If you've signed, make sure you take responsibility." `
`"Lady Lambdadelta is also the Witch of Certainty. `
`...The Witch of Certainty prefers to make fate firm, to create a fate of Certainty. `
`She really liked and highly valued your efforts until today." `
`"Well, you had that unfortunate childhood, all that unrewarded effort... I can sympathize juuust a bit with that. `
`It's not like I felt sorry for you or anything, so don't be so full of yourself! `
`Tsu-n!" `
`"...From my point of view, your succession...well, it was more of a coincidence than a miracle. `
`It isn't worthy of my recommendation." `
`"*cackle* `
`This is Lady Bernkastel. `
`She's quite hard to please. `
`Still, you could say that just having her participate in this celebration makes you exceedingly lucky." `
`"......I only came because this is a rare, once-in-a-millennium event. `
`And I heard there'd be some good sake." `
`"New Beatrice-sama, `
`please, come greet us as well." `
`"Huh? ...Oh, ...I'm pleased to meet you..." `
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory were gathered in a line. `
`The eldest sister, Lucifer, took a step forward and kneeled. `
`"This is furniture that serves me. `
`As a gift to celebrate your inheritance, I will send them to you. `
`...Once you succeed the position of Golden Witch, you will need to carry out the resurrection ceremony for yourself. `
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory perform an essential role in that ceremony. `
`...They're a villainous bunch, but they serve their purpose. `
`Have them do whatever you wish." `
`"We will always be by Beatrice-sama's side. `
`Please order us to do anything you desire. `
`We'll accomplish our tasks without fail...!" `
`Even after that, many nobles and minions visited and offered words of congratulation for the new witch. `
`As she responded to them confusedly, `
`she felt as though she was growing light-headed due to lack of oxygen. `
`...She couldn't tell if this was something real or unreal. `
`But there was just one thing she could understand. `
`A feeling of achievement at being permitted to call herself the Golden Witch. `
`...That alone was a truth she could definitely understand... `
`"......What...is all this? `
`Of course, I'm not gonna swallow this story, ...but what in the world does it mean?! `
`Aunt Eva is the new Beatrice? `
`Are you saying she's turned into a witch? `
`...What the hell...?!!" `
`"I was also surprised. `
`To think that someone would be able to solve that riddle. `
`...However, that is the rule. `
`I must follow it...and pass on the position of Golden Witch and my name." `
`"It is hardly something to be surprised about. `
`At the very beginning, you wrote that rule in a letter and announced it. `
`...Eva-sama was simply the first to be successful. `
`That is all there is to say." `
`"...Virgilia, are you there?!" `
`"Yes, here I am..." `
`"What does this farce mean?! `
`Even if this depiction of strange witches showing up one after another is some of her bullshit...! `
`...Isn't this almost like Aunt Eva turned into a witch?!" `
`"Calm yourself. `
`She has simply received the title of 'Endless Witch'...and might call herself that in the future. `
`...This succession ceremony is certainly nothing more than an act to promote that child's 'explanation'. `
`Don't fall for the same move over and over again." `
`"Th-That's right... `
`That whole grand ceremony was all phony. `
`But it's at least a fact that Aunt Eva solved the riddle of the epitaph. `
`...And at the same time, that means she succeeded the Ushiromiya Family Headship." `
`"...And after getting 10 tons of gold, `
`...Aunt Eva might as well call herself the 'Golden Witch'... ...Is that it...? `
`Damn, it's as complicated as ever...!!" `
`"...My, my. `
`Is a boorish Human unable to comprehend the grandeur of this ceremony? `
`...Oh, well. `
`Being unable to read between the lines is what makes you Human. `
`I pity you, but I do not blame you." `
`"Damn it... `
`Don't look at me like you feel sorry for me... `
`......Still, for the time being, there's something I need to check." `
`"And that's regarding this younger version of Aunt Eva... `
`in other words, the definition of this new Beatrice. `
`...What is that?!" `
`"Even if I tell of it, you will just persist in your disbelief in magic and witches, correct? `
`So there's nothing in particular for me to explain. `
`Feel free to believe in whatever it seems to be to you." `
`"...What it seems to be to me...?! `
`Then...then how should I interpret this...?!" `
`"For now, it might not hurt to view it as a visualization of a separate entity inside Ushiromiya Eva." `
`"...Of course, you cannot blindly accept that answer, but it is probably a reasonable theory to hold for the time being." `
`"......I-In other words, I should think of Aunt Eva and her as the same person, right? `
`...Damn, ...I don't like where this is going..." `
`"In any case, from now on, my name is no longer Beatrice. `
`I have passed it on to Ushiromiya Eva. `
`...Which means that I am nameless! `
`Battleer, don't you have some name that'd be fitting for me? `
`I shall accept your recommendation! `
`How about a name that's refined, full of elegance, and a little cute too, if you can...!" `
`"...Just 'Beato' is good enough for you. `
`There's probably a big enough difference between Beato and Beatrice to keep people from getting confused." `
`"...N-Nngg. `
`So, the same old Beato, is it? `
`It doesn't feel wrong, but it's boring for some reason. `
`Nggg." `
`"Pu ku ku ku ku... `
`They say the temperature of black tea and a woman's heart are difficult to gauge in any era." `
`"......Battler-kun, `
`at any rate, stay calm from this point onwards. `
`The fact that we can now tell her and Ushiromiya Eva apart works to our advantage, `
`compared to the time when that child was still Beatrice." `
`"...And that's exactly... `
`...why I like it even less. `
`...What's she thinking, `
`that Beato......?" `
`Over there, the witches formed a long line to bless Aunt Eva, `
`who had the figure of her younger days and who now possessed the name Beatrice. `
`It was like a witch's coronation. `
`The countless gold butterflies flapped their wings, directing this fantastical, gold-sparkling space. `
`They were all praising her. `
`As I stared from the distance, `
`I looked at the newly born Beatrice, who had a slightly embarrassed smile on her face. `
`...Her expression, which had been lost and confused at first, `
`seemed to be full of the happiness that she was finally starting to recognize. `
`That expression didn't look at all like someone laughing insanely while standing before the gold. `
`There was just the innocence of a person basking in their own joy. `
`As a person who denied the existence of witches, I couldn't view this witch succession ceremony with a joyful expression and accept her... `
`...However, when I looked at that innocent smile, `
`I felt like I wanted to offer my blessings, just for that moment. `
`It's always beautiful when strong efforts bear fruits and are rewarded. `
`Aunt Eva, who had always yearned to succeed the Headship, and who had worked hard since her youth without reward, `
`...had spectacularly taken hold of the chance given to her by the riddle of the epitaph...and had finally gained that position. `
`How divine is the smile of a person whose childhood dreams have been granted? `
`I definitely won't accept witches. `
`But, ...Battler put his hands together, making a small sound. `
`*clap*. *clap*. `
`...It didn't reach her ears, ...but it did bless her. `
`"......Congratulations, Aunt Eva." `
`You spectacularly solved the riddle of the epitaph before anyone else. `
`It's your victory without any complaints. `
`......I won't accept all that about the Golden Witch and so on, but I will accept you as the new Head of the Ushiromiya family, and I'll celebrate that sincerely. `
`"......Hmph." `
`As though urged on by Battler's applause, Beato also clapped. `
`...It was a slightly odd scene. `
`Battler and Beato, who opposed each other, were standing side by side and applauding the same person. `
`"I'm not applauding for a witch. `
`...I'm clapping for all of Aunt Eva's efforts up until now." `
`"As am I. `
`I offer my sincere applause as a blessing to Eva, who spectacularly solved that epitaph." `
`"......Hmm. `
`...I don't like applauding with you. `
`...But, well, I've decided that I won't worry about it now. `
`...Divine punishment won't fall on me just because I clap with you every once in a while." `
`"Hmm. `
`It's not so bad every once in a while. `
`...Still, it is fun to applaud. `
`Even though it was Eva who was successful and not me, for some reason, I'm starting to feel happy too." `
`"That's because blessing someone means the same thing as sympathizing and sharing with them." `
`"I see. `
`Then, I have even shared this irrational happy feeling with you. `
`...Since we are a pair of enemies trying to make each other surrender, it is an odd experience." `
`"Well, ...just for now, let's have a truce and clap, okay?" `
`Beato laughed impishly, playing around and applauding even louder, `
`as though eagerly trying not to lose to Battler as she clapped. `
`Battler went along with her and clapped even louder. `
`When he did, as though some ceremony had ended, everyone applauded and highly praised the reborn Beatrice. `
`It was just as though Battler's and Beato's applause had been the final thing needed for her succession... `
