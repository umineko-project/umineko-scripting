`The vase was very beautiful, rich with history and value. `
`Even as young as I was, it still forced me to take a deep breath when I witnessed its beauty. `
`Of course, it was a member of Grandfather's favorite collection. `
`So that I didn't accidentally destroy its fragile beauty, `
`I was always given strict orders never to touch it. `
`...But that just made me want to touch it. `
`It looked light...and yet so elegant that just glancing at it gave it an indescribable sense of dignity. `
`...I wanted to see what it felt like to touch a vase like that. `
`However, ...just as Grandfather had said, it was a thing that shouldn't be touched. `
`Something this beautiful should never be touched. `
`Such beauty can only dwell in something so easily broken. `
`Because of that, just the brush of a finger by someone like me would... `
`Just like how a fun dream disappears with a 'poof' when you wake up, `
`...it disappeared, fell, and broke into pieces. `
`I realized that, because of my own foolish curiosity, I had done something that couldn't be taken back. `
`No matter how much I regretted it, no matter how much I apologized... `
`The broken vase would not be returned to its original form... `
`Grandfather will probably scold me. `
`Probably very harshly. `
`I ended up breaking into tears and sobbing, frightened... `
`As I did, I noticed something............beautiful. `
`Lightly dancing golden butterflies... `
`were coming towards me. `
`As mysteriously glowing golden dots shone in the air, the butterflies began to gather, one at a time. `
`Oh, it's Beatrice. `
`Beatrice, that reliable Golden Witch, had arrived. `
`The butterflies kept gathering until they formed a cloud, ...and then she was there... `
`She was always there for me. `
`Whenever I was in trouble, she'd always appear and save me. `
`"Good day to you, princess." `
`"Beatrice! `
`...Waaaah, hic, hic...!" `
`"Oh, my... `
`Why are you crying so, and on a day so well-suited for a tea party...?" `
`"...I broke Grandfather's precious vase... `
`Waah, Grandfather's gonna get mad at me. `
`...I don't know what to do... `
`Hic..." `
`"I see, that is worrying. `
`The Master really treasured this particular vase, didn't he? `
`...Hohohoho, imagining how he'll punish you scares even me, Beatrice." `
`Grandfather was a very frightening person. `
`And when you failed to follow something he said even once, he would become so mad, with a rage that would make even the fallen angels in hell quiver. `
`Since I knew that down to my bones, I couldn't do anything but tremble and cry... `
`"I possess no magic that can scoop up your fallen tears, princess, `
`but if you need magic that will prevent the Master from scolding you, I might be able to manage something." `
`"R-Really...?" `
`"Yes, if you'll be gracious enough to believe in my power, princess. `
`The power of belief is the source of magic. `
`...Miracles only appear before those of great faith." `
`"...I-I believe... `
`I believe in your power, Beatrice. `
`So please, fix this vase. `
`Please...!" `
`"If that is what you want, princess. `
`...Then leave it to me, Beatrice." `
`When she extended her index finger, a golden butterfly softly landed there and changed its form into her favorite cane. `
`But even that was enough to give me a small glimpse at Beatrice's wonderful and awesome magic power. `
`She pointed her cane at the broken vase, and, just like a child's lullaby, she began speaking the magic words... `
`"Come, try closing your eyes. `
`And try to remember. `
`What form did you have? `
`It was surely a very, very beautiful form. `
`Please, show me that form one more time..." `
`Were they words, or was it a song? `
`No, it had to be magic. `
`After all, can't you see? ...The pieces of the vase are rapidly gathering together, `
`gently returning to the place where they'd been on display, ...reassembling into their original form. `
`"...Incredible..." `
`"See? `
`Now it's back to normal. `
`This way, you won't have to get yelled at by the Master." `
`"Beatrice, you really are amazing. `
`You can fix broken vases like it's nothing." `
`"That's not true. `
`Returning something broken to its original form is a very, very difficult thing to do. `
`My magic can only make it remember what it once was for a short time." `
`"...? `
`But the vase really turned back to the way it was, right...?" `
`"Correct. `
`But that doesn't mean the vase has avoided its fate of being broken. `
`All I did was temporarily get the broken vase to remember its form before it broke. `
`I have not yet attained the high levels of magical power that might be used to restore a broken fate to its original form." `
`At that time, the high-pitched scream of a servant could be heard from inside the mansion. `
`When I went to see what had happened, `
`...I noticed that several of the servants had gathered...and were cleaning up the remains of the broken vase. `
`From what they said, it seemed a black cat had sneaked in from somewhere and had climbed up on the vase, causing it to break. `
`I understood the meaning of Beatrice's words. `
`...At the moment I broke the vase, 'the vase was broken'. `
`Beatrice let me see the vase being restored, but that was a temporary thing. `
`It didn't mean she'd changed the fate of 'the vase being broken'. `
`And so, ...the vase remembered its true fate and 'broke'. `
`However, the one who broke it wasn't me, but a cat that had snuck in... `
`That's right. `
`Beatrice never said 'Let's fix the vase'. `
`She said she'd prevent the Master from scolding me. `
`The fate of the vase breaking hasn't changed, but the fact that I broke it certainly has... `
`Beatrice cleverly saved me from danger with that magic... `
`"It is very easy to break something. `
`After all, you didn't need magic to break that vase, princess." `
`"...Then, is fixing stuff really hard...?" `
`"It is. `
`It's so hard that you broke down crying, unsure of what to do." `
`"...Does that mean magic is easier to use when doing terrifying things? `
`That breaking... `
`...and killing is really easy, `
`...but fixing and reviving things is really hard...?" `
`"...That's right. `
`With magic, it is far easier to break and kill. `
`That's why weak witches lose to temptation and become intoxicated with gathering easy power for themselves, neglecting their true magical training. `
`...Real magic is the power to repair, to revive. `
`To summon happiness that has disappeared, to summon love that has grown cold. `
`And, it can even summon a smile to the face of a princess who has forgotten how." `
`"Then...Beatrice, since you managed to fix that vase, does that mean you're an incredible witch?" `
`"My days of training are far from over. `
`After all, I couldn't make the vase forget its fate for even an hour. `
`I'm sure my teacher, who taught me magic, `
`would have been able to restore the vase to its original form forever." `
`"So, if it kept breaking and breaking, she'd be able to fix it over and over again...?" `
`"Yes. `
`When one reaches that level, they are considered to be an Endless Witch. `
`That is the endless level that all witches ought to reach. `
`We offer the utmost respect to those witches and call them by that title." `
`"An Endless Witch..." `
`"That's right. `
`...To witches with the power to mend things endlessly, the concept of breaking doesn't even exist. `
`They are released from all the sadness caused by losing things and are promised eternal bliss." `
`Certainly, the human world is full of sadness caused by separation and loss. `
`To escape that sadness, people pray to gods and ask for the power to withstand their sadness, believing it to be a test... `
`In other words, a human's life is a journey, searching for a way to withstand sadness. `
`In that case, a witch who could revive all things would be freed from all sadness in the world. `
`...Simply put, that would mean eternal bliss... `
`"I wonder...if I could become a witch like you...and gain eternal happiness." `
`"You, princess...? `
`Hohohoh. ...It is a long, long, difficult path, you see?" `
`"I want to become a witch. `
`...I want to find happiness. `
`Beatrice, I want to become your disciple." `
`"......... `
`Do you have even a trace of doubt in that feeling?" `
`"No. `
`I want to become a witch too." `
`"...I understand. `
`Then, until you get tired of me, I will make you my disciple. `
`...Will you call me Teacher?" `
`"Yes, Teacher." `
`"That's a good answer. `
`Then from now on, learn the depths of magic along with me. `
`I am also in training. `
`Let us both learn the proper use of magic, doing our best to reach that blissful level." `
`"Yes, Teacher...!" `
`"......... `
`...Ah, a dream. `
`...That face takes me back..." `
`An Endless Witch, was it? `
`That rank I'd yearned for in the past as the highest possible achievement...was now just another one of my titles. `
`No, you might even call it my calling card. `
`"...Every once in a while, being called that can be quite satisfying. `
`I trained so many days to achieve that rank. `
`...It'd be a bit of a waste if I never got a chance to appreciate it. `
`...*cackle*cackle*cackle*." `
`She shook her head lightly. `
`If it's the highest possible level, that means there's nothing higher. `
`An eternal dead end, the beginning of eternal boredom. `
`"I remember what Teacher told me. `
`When one is released from all sadness, it is the same as eternal bliss. `
`...That's what makes me think... `
`that Teacher {i:couldn't ever have reached that level}." `
`Eternal bliss means eternal boredom. `
`...And that's the beginning of eternal torture. `
`But it all depends on how you look at it. `
`Eternal boredom is the same as a sketchbook that doesn't run out of pages. `
`It means you can draw whatever you want, can try to have as much fun as you want. `
`Boredom is the worst sort of poison, which kills all witches. `
`...Even those Great Witches who are given the title 'Lady' fear it. `
`It's the eternal poison that tortures them because of the eternal bliss they've reached... `
`"Now that I've earned the name of Endless Witch, I truly wish I could speak with Teacher again. `
`...Is 'happiness' really what lay at the end of our training? `
`And just what is 'happiness'? I wish I could talk with her about that now." `
`'Training has no end. `
`When you think you've reached the eternal level, that's exactly the time to bemoan your own immaturity.' `
`...I recalled those words as though she'd answered me directly. `
`"*cackle*cackle*, hahhahahahahahahahaha... `
`I see, ...so I'm immature, am I?! `
`How amusing, how truly amusing. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!" `
`The sound of painfully shrill laughter rang out. `
`It was coming from my furniture. `
`...What, did they break their toy again? `
`"Beatrice-sama, `
`this guy's stopped moving again." `
`"And I haven't had nearly enough fun yet. `
`What a pathetic man." `
`"But I haven't gotten a chance to play at all yet! `
`Let me play, let me plaaay!" `
`"Be silent, filth! `
`If you keep devouring him like starving dogs, of course he'll keep breaking right away, no matter how well Beatrice-sama fixes him up." `
`"You broke him the most, Satan-nee. `
`You just don't know what holding back means." `
`"My apologies, Beatrice-sama. `
`Please forgive my stupid little sisters." `
`"Fix him quicklyyy! `
`I'm next, I'm neeext!" `
`"Aaah, must you keep up that infernal racket?!?!" `
`"""""""Eeep!!""""""" `
`A single yell was all it took to make the noisy Sisters of the Seven Stakes vanish. `
`All they do is mess around, having as much fun as they want breaking him. `
`They only come to me to clean up afterwards. `
`...Truly, this furniture never leaves me bored. `
`Once the furniture hid themselves, ...all that remained was a sloppy mess, the last remnants of a broken toy. `
`It had no form anymore. `
`"...It's hard even for me to remember its original form in this state. `
`Better to make it remember for itself, perhaps. `
`...Oh, well." `
`I waved my golden pipe. `
`Then I spoke. `
`I chanted. `
`I made it remember. `
`"...Come, try to remember. `
`What form did you have? `
`...After all, right now, you pretty much look like a huge lump of scrap meat. `
`I've no idea which part is your arm and which is your leg. `
`Unless you remember, I won't even be able to recall your face. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*!" `
`By the power of magic, the pitiful pieces of meat began to remember what their form had been. `
`Which part should go with which part, `
`and where should join with where? `
`That's right, just like that. `
`...No, no, you should be a finger on the left hand. `
`That's the right hand. `
`That's it, good, good, *cackle*. `
`"...Good morning. `
`Have you woken up, Ushiromiya Battler? `
`How ironic, that your true nightmare begins after you awaken." `
`"...*cough*...*cough*... `
`......Nngg...owowow..." `
`"If you would just accept that I am a witch, you'll quickly wake up from this nightmare, and I'll send you to heaven. `
`I am the king of Mount Purgatory. `
`There's no escape from this hell without my approval." `
`"Heh, ...hehehehe. `
`You call this hell? That's just useless. `
`Aah, it's all useless." `
`"I'm impressed you can still talk like that, after experiencing the pain of death not once, like any normal human, `
`but more times than I could count with all of my fingers. `
`*cackle* `
`This is why I never get bored. `
`I never get bored of you." `
`"Yeah, no boredom problem here. `
`After all, I get my pick of those massive tit Nee-chan's with the dazzling asses in my harem. `
`Thanks to that, I'm not likely to get bored for a while now." `
`"*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*! `
`That's splendid. `
`Otherwise I would get bored too. `
`So, my furniture, `
`I've fixed him, so you can play as much as you want." `
`"Thank you very much! `
`Kyaha, all mine!" `
`"I told you, your turn's over, I'm next! `
`Get away from him, waaah!" `
`"Heheheheheh. `
`Wonderful, isn't it, Battler-kuuun? `
`Look how popular you are." `
`"Popular guys have it rough. `
`Get in line, freaks." `
`"If you just stayed obedient instead of acting tough, this would go much easier." `
`"Nah, he's good like this. `
`His screams feel so much better." `
`"Okay, let's not break him so quickly this time. `
`Did you all hear me?!" `
`"You aren't running this show! `
`Battler-kun, `
`let's continue where we left off, okay? `
`After they locked Jessica-chan's room with the master key, how did they return the key to the corpse's pocket, which was inside the room?" `
`"...Well, maybe... `
`...That's it, they used a fishing line or something, sending just the key into the room through the crack of the door..." `
`"Kyahhahahahahahaha!! `
`Wrooong!" `
`"So naive. `
`{p:1:Of all of the doors that exist on Rokkenjima, none has a crack through which a key can slip}." `
`"He was wrong, right, right? `
`Okay, this time it's me, my turn! `
`Wheeere should I strike?!" `
`"Me, back of the hand!" `
`"Gh...!!" `
`"No faaair! `
`Okay, then I've got the back of his other hand!" `
`"Gwoaaahhh...!!" `
`"I'll take the tip of his nose!" `
`"Ga...gagah......!!" `
`"Why, why? Let me do it too, let me strike too! `
`Waaah!!" `
`"Don't be so slow, Levia-nee! We've always done first come, first serve! `
`Okay, I'll take the top of his foot!" `
`"Ugwaahh......!!" `
`"Waaah!! `
`Me too, me too! `
`I'll take his shoulder, okay?!" `
`"Ga...hahh......!!" `
`"Keh... `
`You're sisters right? Play nice with each other, okay...? `
`...Gwaaa...aggh......nn..." `
`"...I can't believe you're still resisting. `
`Why haven't you realized that your false courage actually gets us fired up?" `
`"Sorry, but... `
`false courage and being stubborn are my specialties. `
`No matter how you all try to confuse the issues, I definitely won't accept witches and magic...!" `
`"Even though you can't explain anything with human tricks? `
`Are you stupid?! `
`Know your place!" `
`"It's okay, we don't have to force him to accept it. `
`Soon, he'll wanna accept it so hard he'll start crying. `
`Even now, he really wants to kneel down on the ground pitifully and beg our forgiveness!" `
`"Ugaah, guahgehgehgyahh...!!" `
`"Aaaah, he's broken already! `
`Beatrice-sama!" `
`"...Ah, well. `
`Since they know I can revive him over and over, my furniture won't even hesitate to break him. `
`Good grief." `
`Giving eternal rebirth and eternal death at will. `
`Before the Endless Witch Beatrice, all death and life has no meaning. `
`Even death can't become the key to escape from my cage. `
`"Come, Battler. `
`Remember your original form again. `
`I'll toy with you to my heart's content, understand? `
`I see, I see, how truly pleasant to have a toy to play with for all eternity. `
`...Ah, could this be the endless bliss witches gain at the endless level?" `
`"I see, I see. `
`Yes, this bliss certainly is amusing. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*! `
`Wahhahahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`I'll revive you over and over, kill you over and over! `
`Let's see, what kind of murder play will unfold on the next game board? `
`Come, bring it in. Let the next game begin, Ushiromiya Battleeer!!" `
