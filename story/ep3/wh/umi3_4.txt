`"...I see... `
`So she's not a witch, but a mistress named Beatrice, who lived on the island... `
`...So there can be more than 18 people! `
`Which means I can defeat the line of reasoning that says any crime impossible for all 18 people must involve magic. `
`...That's a big scoop." `
`"Pardon me. `
`Battler-sama, would you like some black tea and cookies?" `
`Beato's butler, who called himself Ronove, appeared out of nowhere. `
`A plate set on a silver tray that he held was filled with delicious-looking, steaming black tea and cookies. `
`...I really don't like this guy's smile. `
`For some reason, it doesn't look like a smile used to warmly greet a guest. `
`It feels like he's mocking me somehow. `
`...I don't know if he really takes me for an idiot, `
`or if it's just a joke or something, but it's really irritating me. `
`"...I don't need any. `
`I'm busy now. `
`Leave me alone." `
`"Oh, my. `
`Such a shame, and the cookies were so delicious too. `
`Cooked so wonderfully they would be wasted on a mere Human." `
`"I'll eat some when I feel like it. `
`Just set it down somewhere and get out of here." `
`"Will that be acceptable? `
`Then I shall do so. `
`You may eat them when they get cold and stale, and then regret to the fullest that you did not eat them while they were fresh." `
`"......You really are annoying. `
`...Well, you're a lot better than that Beato, who keeps doing that creepy cackle right next to my ear." `
`"Yes, yes, that is quite true. `
`There are times when Milady's laughter becomes quite undignified. `
`Every time I hear it, I find it painful to comprehend `
`why such a noble demon as myself must serve such a Master. `
`Pu ku ku ku..." `
`"...Man, you're weird. `
`If you don't like it, then couldn't you just not work for her?" `
`"And yet, to continue serving is furniture's joy. `
`If we do not serve, we would hardly be furniture." `
`"...Setting that aside, `
`how has the game been proceeding? `
`Just now, you seemed to have found some useful information that quite pleased you. `
`Well now, I wonder what your shallow wit has conjured up." `
`As Ronove mocked me and giggled, `
`he followed my earlier words literally and placed the black tea and cookies in a random spot nearby. `
`"...In any case, it appears you are now more confident in the existence of a 19th person, yes? `
`Would you be gracious enough to allow me to hear your opinion?" `
`"......... `
`...Yeah, sure. `
`I'm just going to say it again in front of Beato anyway. `
`No reason to hide it. `
`...Basically, `
`it looks like there's a hidden mansion somewhere on this island, and that Grandfather had his mistress living there. `
`So, the question that's been torturing me about whether there are 18 or 19 people...can be easily resolved." `
`"You have driven yourself into a corner because of the dead-end that you yourself have created. `
`Even though you deny the witch, Battler-sama, you hold a double standard, and refuse to accept that the culprit is one of the 18." `
`"...The easiest way to deny the witch would be to suspect one of the 18. `
`...It isn't easy to gather alibis for every one of them. `
`You always find at least one person with a fragile alibi. `
`...I could probably continue to deny the witch forever if I just used that person as a scapegoat." `
`"However, I refuse to do that!! `
`Aah, it's useless, it's all useless! `
`Every one of those 18 people is either a parent, a relative or a cousin to me! `
`And those reliable servants, who are sometimes serious and sometimes fun to be with. `
`I won't let myself use any one of them as a scapegoat!!" `
`"In the past, my resolve wavered. `
`That's how Beato hit me where my heart was weak." `
`"...Ah, accepting and understanding one's own weaknesses. `
`It is not something that can often be accomplished. `
`Battler-sama, you use this theory about a 19th person as a spear. `
`...Or should I say, a shield?" `
`"In any event, in contrast to how unprepared you were in the previous games, `
`the fact that you now have a compass bearing on how to fight... ...is a dramatic leap forward, let us say. `
`With this, you can suspect a 19th person and pursue your theory that the culprit is a human, `
`without having to doubt any of the 18 you love and respect." `
`"That's it exactly. `
`Like in the first game, when Kanon-kun was killed in the boiler room, `
`...and a bunch of other places, `
`...there were plenty of tricks I could've mentioned without hesitation, `
`as long as a 19th person existed." `
`In the very first game, Kanon-kun was killed in the boiler room. `
`One might think he was attacked by Kumasawa-san, who had gone down into the boiler room with him, `
`or maybe that someone who had appeared to be dead earlier was actually faking and had ambushed him. `
`Either way, it was a move that forced me to suspect one of the 18. `
`However, by simply proposing that a 19th person existed, `
`there was no longer any need to suspect one of the 18 for that murder in the boiler room. `
`"In short! `
`I can at least deny the line of reasoning saying that... `
`if something is impossible for every one of the 18, therefore the culprit is a witch." `
`Using this argument, it's easy to explain, for example, `
`the problematic case that has already occurred in this game, `
`'who gave Maria the letter?' `
`Even if all 18 people have alibis, `
`I could easily explain everything by saying that a 19th person must've visited her and given her the letter. `
`"......Hmm, hmm. `
`I'd say that's quite a good move. `
`Now, how would I strike back against it?" `
`"...You still have plenty of weak points, even if you are aware of them. `
`Maybe the '18 person attack' would be an effective move. `
`To judge the strength of your defense, it may be amusing to contest that point again." `
`"Then how will you do it, `
`demon butler...?!" `
`"...I believe it would be appropriate to ambush the piece representing this 19th person that you mentioned. `
`Battler-sama, you have never met this 19th person, yes? `
`Would you please show some proof that this 19th person exists?" `
`"How naive. `
`Of course, I knew you'd probably try that move...!" `
`"My, my. `
`Please respond to it." `
`"Witches and demons and the like... `
`There's no more fitting move for you guys to use. `
`...It's one of those... `
`"The "Devil's Proof"!" `
`When you try to make some claim to humans like us, we always counterattack by telling you to show some proof. `
`Because that's a human move. `
`But I'm fighting with a witch. `
`I'm taking part in a battle with someone who isn't human! `
`And some moves exist that can only be used in a game against a witch. `
`There are cheap moves! `
`And that's what this 'Devil's Proof' is. `
`Because it's impossible to prove! `
`Let's assume that there's a hidden mansion on Rokkenjima, separate from the Ushiromiya family mansion, `
`and that a woman named Beatrice lives there. `
`In order to prove this, one must find this mansion and actually bring Beatrice out of it. `
`That's called actual proof in the human world. `
`However, if we follow the rules of the 'Devil's Proof', you can't deny that she exists, even if there's no proof that she does. `
`Because it's impossible to prove that something doesn't exist. `
`...That's right, I'm finally able to turn the tables using this 'Devil's Proof', which tormented me so much before. `
`Those guys were always trying to force me to accept the existence of the witch with it. `
`After all, it was physically impossible for me to show any proof `
`that 'witches don't exist' and deny Beato's claims. `
`That's why I kept getting hit with the reckless argument that witches do exist...and was unable to counterattack. `
`And that's why I'll spin the chessboard around right now! `
`If I can't disprove the existence of witches, then that means... `
`if I suggest that a 19th human exists, you can't deny that either. `
`In other words, because this problematic and mysterious mistress is craftily hiding herself, it'd be perfectly natural if you never found her no matter how hard you looked. `
`So, you can't say that your inability to find this 19th person proves that she doesn't exist. `
`Therefore, it's impossible to deny the 19th person's existence. `
`Beato used the 'Devil's Proof' to make denying her own existence impossible, `
`but this time it's become my weapon. `
`If we can get away with this argument, then forget just a 19th person, `
`this island could be full of people we don't know about, `
`and even if there were 10 or 100 of them, she still couldn't deny that they existed. `
`In the last game and the one before that, among the murder scenes that showed up, there were several that were extremely intricate and must've taken a lot of effort to set up. `
`It's really hard to imagine a single culprit setting up all of those. `
`However, if not just a 19th person, but 10 or 100 people were hidden somewhere, that wouldn't be any problem at all. `
`If they all split up the work, they could handle any job in a short period of time. `
`Of course, doubts will naturally arise as to whether a large group of people like that could sneak around the mansion without being noticed, `
`but those are all settled by the 'Devil's Proof'. `
`You can't deny that even 100 people were there just because they weren't seen or noticed. `
`Even though I'm saying it myself, it's such a stupid argument that it makes me wanna throw up! `
`However, because it's such a dirty move, it's a perfect one to use against a witch. `
`Well, this is just my imagination, `
`...but what if about 100 suspicious men wearing goat masks were hiding in the shadows... `
`Something like that's worse than laughable, almost like they're cockroaches. `
`If you see one, it means there's 100 more hiding somewhere. `
`"...Well, I do think it's a ridiculous argument that's horribly twisted. `
`If my opponent were human, I'm sure they'd yell at me like I was out of my mind. `
`...But my opponent is a witch. `
`And after all, that's the kind of competition we're having, isn't it? `
`I'll use any kind of reckless argument to explain it using humans and deny the witch!!" `
`"...Anyway, with this move, I won't have to doubt any of the 18 who are close to me again. `
`I won't suffer a defeat like last time again...!!" `
`"...I see. `
`You have learned from your previous defeat. `
`That is good. `
`It's no surprise that you've become so devious now that you're in your third game." `
`"......You first strengthen your own defense. `
`That is truly a solid first step. `
`Quite a spectacular move, I would say." `
`"Well, even if we do assume that there's a 19th person, `
`there are still a few tricks left that I can't resolve, like the actual number of master keys, no matter how many humans I add. `
`...Still, it isn't bad as a first step, for the time being." `
`"Battler-sama, your trump card is the important piece called the 19th person. `
`...You countered my move of asking where the proof was by using the 'Devil's Proof'. `
`...A good skirmish. `
`Although I must apologize for making a move by myself when Milady isn't here, `
`......I find that I too am growing slightly interested. `
`...I wonder if you will allow me to make yet another move on Milady's behalf?" `
`"...Let's have it. `
`I've got no shortage of opponents, be they witches or demons!" `
`"This move you presented called the 'Devil's Proof'... `
`It's a specialty of us demons, but there are also various other moves available to us. `
`...Do you know of a move called 'Hempel's Raven'?" `
`"Hempel's Raven...?? `
`What are you talking about?" `
`"...*cackle*cackle*. `
`Ah-hahahahahahahahah-hahahahah-hah-ha...!" `
`Just then...aah, that enraging laugh I've heard so many times started echoing. `
`The room was filled with dazzling golden butterflies, and in the center of that whirlwind, the Golden Witch appeared. `
`"If it isn't Milady. `
`Good morning." `
`"I thought you might be doing something interesting while I was away. `
`...'Hempel's Raven', was it? `
`Such a familiar old move I could almost laugh. `
`To think the day has come when I get to show it off to Battler. `
`It's a classic move to use against a 'Devil's Proof'." `
`"...Ronove, I will make this move. `
`Do not get in the way of my fun." `
`"So you've finally shown up, you guffawing witch. `
`I see you're laughing like a freak just as usual. `
`...This guy was talking behind your back just now, telling me how undignified you look when you do that. `
`Right?" `
`"How rude. `
`Is that true?" `
`"Nonsense. `
`Why would I speak such gossip about Milady, `
`whom I regard with such sincere respect?" `
`"...I can't believe you'd say something so shameless. `
`Doesn't look like we'll be getting along well together..." `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle* `
`Well, that is fine. `
`Let us return to the point at hand. `
`'Hempel's Raven' is used to show actual proof using the contrapositive. `
`...In other words, it is a move like this... `
`What must you do to prove that ravens are black?" `
`"Huh? `
`What are you talking about?? `
`Prove that ravens are black... `
`...Wouldn't you just have to catch a raven and check to see if it's black?" `
`"That's right. `
`You must simply prove that 'a raven = black'. `
`Do you see that, if you instead prove that 'birds that aren't black = not ravens', you would reach the same argument? `
`If you go throughout the world and examine all birds that are not ravens, and prove that none of them are black, `
`then as a result, you can claim that 'therefore, black birds are ravens'. `
`This is called an argument by the contrapositive. `
`...Is that too difficult for you?" `
`"Yeah, no kidding. `
`...I've got no idea what you're saying." `
`"Battler-sama, `
`what about this example? `
`Let us say that you have two boxes, and one of them is a winner, with a cookie inside. `
`Of course, the other one is a loser and is empty." `
`For example, here are two boxes, `
`where one has a cookie inside and means you win...while the other is empty and means you lose. `
`At this moment, 'it has a cookie inside = you win', `
`which implies that 'you do not win = it had no cookie inside'. `
`When such a relationship exists, the latter is called the contrapositive... `
`When 'if A then B' is true, then 'if not B then not A' is also true. `
`"...Well, that's obvious. `
`If the one you guessed was the loser, then you'd automatically know that the other one was the winner." `
`"...In other words, if you choose the box at random, whether it's the winner or the loser, `
`you'll be able to figure out which box has the cookie in it after your first move." `
`"That is correct. `
`If the cookie is in the box you open, then the 'Devil's Proof' is satisfied. `
`You can directly prove that 'this box is the winner = this box has a cookie in it'. `
`However, if the box you open is empty, then the reverse, Hempel's Raven, is satisfied. `
`In other words 'this box does not have a cookie in it = this box isn't the winner." `
`"And as long as we accept the premise that there are no more than two boxes, `
`the contrapositive shows that the other box is automatically the winner." `
`"...Well, I think I'm starting to see your reasoning. `
`Only poison can stop poison, and only twisted logic can stop twisted logic. `
`...Then what? `
`How does that overturn my claim that, 'because there's definitely a 19th human hidden on this island, `
`even if all 18 people have alibis, `
`I still won't have to accept witches'...?" `
`"Very well. `
`I will teach you about my move. `
`First of all, you are stating that 'the culprit is not among the 18 = the culprit is a 19th person'. `
`*cackle*cackle*! `
`...So if you use the contrapositive, it ends up like this. `
`In short, 'the culprit is not a 19th person = the culprit is one of the 18'!" `
`"Huuuh?! `
`What the, what do you mean?!" `
`"Only that I've countered your move. `
`Let's try and keep things simple. `
`Ronove, explain. `
`It seems you've made things easy enough for Battler to understand with your cookie in a box analogy." `
`"Then forgive my presumption. `
`Allow me to explain my earlier example once more." `
`Allow me to repeat my earlier story about two treasure boxes, `
`one of which has a cookie in it. `
`In this situation, you have an '18 person box' and a '19th person box'. `
`So the cookie represents the culprit. `
`Battler-sama, let's say you open the 18 person box. `
`Because the cookie is not there, `
`you have paradoxically proven that 'therefore, the cookie is in the 19th person box'. `
`That lets us make an even more paradoxical claim. `
`In other words, if it was first shown that the 19th person box was empty, `
`it would prove at the same time that 'the cookie is in the 18 person box'. `
`Battler-sama played this move in order to avoid having to doubt any of the 18, `
`but it's now been used to prepare an '18 person attack'...!" `
`"......Huh, `
`...what the hell...?" `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*! `
`If I go first and prove that the inside of the 19th person box is empty, `
`you will automatically have to accept that `
`the cookie is in the 18 person box. `
`All I've done is say it the other way around, yes?" `
`"So, ...that move I was so confident in...was actually a double-edged sword?" `
`"That's right. `
`As soon as you played that move and attempted to explain everything with a 19th person, `
`you'd already taken on a risk that you might be forced to accept that the culprit was one of the 18." `
`I see... `
`'Hempel's Raven'. `
`...So this is a countering technique?! `
`...Wait, if I really think about it, this counter is really disadvantageous for me. `
`This isn't a cookie we're talking about. `
`If I imagine that the 'loser' treasure chest actually has a bomb in it, it gets even clearer. `
`And there aren't just two treasure chests, `
`but 18 plus 1 more for the 19th person. `
`If you think of it as a total of 19 boxes, it gets even easier to picture. `
`First off, one of the premises of the human culprit theory is that the bomb will definitely be in one of these boxes. `
`I didn't want to place the bomb in the boxes for any of the 18, so I used the 'Devil's Proof'... `
`and created the 19th person box so I could throw the bomb in there. `
`...That much was fine. `
`But then, Beato struck back. `
`Now, if the contents of the 19th person box are empty, `
`that'll automatically mean that the bomb's in one of the other 18 boxes. `
`If I could examine what's inside all 18 of those boxes, `
`then as long as I can show that the bomb isn't in any of them, `
`I'll be able to safely show that the 18 are innocent. `
`If that were possible, I'd have nothing to fear! `
`However, in reality, that'll be almost absolutely impossible. `
`The police wouldn't come here in this typhoon. `
`We don't have access to scientific investigations or experts or anything. `
`In short, we can't prove anything decisively! `
`It'll be impossible for me to find any proof other than simply gulping down whatever alibis each of the 18 give. `
`That means I personally have to prove their innocence, and I have to do it perfectly. `
`Like by staying with them the whole time, never letting them out of my sight for a second. `
`By doing that, I could probably be sure of that person's innocence, `
`sure that the bomb isn't in their box. `
`...However, in practical terms, that'll be impossible! `
`In other words, I'd have to expend an incredible effort just to check the contents of one box. `
`And there are 18 of them! `
`In other words, unless I bound all 18 of them in chains and watch over them, `
`it'll be impossible to prove that all of them have empty boxes. `
`However, Beato only has to open one box, the 19th person box, `
`and show that it's empty to prove that the bomb's in one of the other 18 boxes. `
`(Furthermore, there's no need for her to show 'which' of the 18 boxes has the bomb!) `
`I've got 18 times more work to do to explain my pet theory than Beatrice does for hers... `
`"When a 'Devil's Proof' exists in the world, `
`it takes a vast amount of effort to argue against it, and there are many cases in which it is impossible to do because of the situation. `
`However, 'Hempel's Raven' turns that problem around...and makes it possible to prove things easily!" `
`"By using 'Hempel's Raven', various reckless arguments become possible to prove true or false. `
`...For example, let us say I make the proposition 'All humans except me = foolish'. `
`Normally, I would have to examine all of humanity except myself and show that they are all foolish. `
`...However, in reality, it would be impossible to investigate billions of people. `
`It's just the same sort of effort you'd need to open all 18 boxes." `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`However, by using 'Hempel's Raven', the contrapositive of that proposition would change it into this. `
`If you, to use your phrase, spin the chessboard around on the claim that 'All humans except me = foolish', `
`you would have to do nothing more than prove that 'not foolish = me'. `
`...And what do you think that means?" `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`As soon as I know the fact that 'I am wise', `
`I will be able to show in an instant that every one of the billions of people in the human race is foolish. `
`In less than a second, I could finish proving that the entire human race is more foolish than me!!" `
`"It truly is the strongest and fastest QED in the world, `
`this `
`'Hempel's Raven'!" `
`"Wha......What a ridiculous argument......!!!" `
`"It is a very, very convenient move. `
`Not only demons, but gods also use it. `
`When they propose that 'the blessed = the servants of a god', `
`the contrapositive is 'a human is not a servant of a god = he must not be blessed'." `
`"So in order to prove that servants of gods are blessed with divine protection, `
`they only have to bring ill fortune down upon those people who don't receive such protection." `
`"......So, by bringing misfortune down upon those who don't believe in them, `
`they prove their blessedness." `
`"An enormous cost is required to give humans happiness. `
`...However, it takes a lot less to bring humans misfortune. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* `
`So by using 'Hempel's Raven', gods are actually giving believers the joy of divine protection for cheap." `
`"...Y-You demon. `
`It's a demon's argument... `
`...That's crazy...!!!" `
`"It seems we've gone off-topic. `
`Let us get back to the point." `
`"The move for my counterattack is complete. `
`...And now, in response to your claim of 'the 19th person is the culprit, therefore, the 18 are innocent and the witch doesn't exist,' `
`I say 'therefore, if I can prove that the culprit is not some 19th person, `
`we can be sure that the culprit is either one of the 18 or a witch, `
`right?'" `
`For a while, I just stood there, shocked, completely forgetting to close my mouth... `
`Just when I'd thought I'd countered one of their strong points, `
`their counterattack had been this reckless argument that I couldn't possibly have anticipated...! `
`Is this...gonna be impossible after all...?! `
`To continue denying the witch on an island with no more than 18 people... `
`and still believe in the innocence of those 18 people... `
`...Is that just a delusion?! `
`Am I just trying to escape reality?! `
`Not yet... `
`...Don't give up this desperate struggle yet. `
`Who cares about 'Whoever's Raven'? `
`They're just trying to confuse me by bringing up weird bits of trivia... `
`I used the 'Devil's Proof'. `
`Don't feel uncertain about something you've used once. `
`Believe in the spear you've drawn. `
`And then, forcefully...gouge it in...! `
`"...We're still in the opening part of the game. `
`Do you plan to keep thinking on this level?" `
`"......... `
`Ah, `
`...wait a sec, `
`I want to be sure. `
`I'll admit I talked about a 19th person to keep it simple, `
`but if we're gonna use the 'Devil's Proof' to raise the number of people above 18, `
`then we'd have no way of knowing if there were 10 people, 100 people, or an indeterminate number of people. `
`{i:There's always one more than you assume}. `
`...Get it?" `
`They countered my twisted logic with something even more twisted. `
`So the only thing that could counter that...would be even crazier twisted logic...! `
`"Hmm, I see. `
`......Even if I somehow prove an alibi for the 19th person, `
`as soon as I do, you will think up a 20th person and claim that they are the culprit. `
`By repeating this endlessly, you would make it so I kept searching for their alibis for all eternity. `
`...I see, I see, *cackle*cackle*! `
`Just like a demon king summoning a plague of locusts. `
`I wouldn't expect anything less from Kinzo's grandchild. `
`It looks like you have been gifted with a talent in summoning." `
`"...In short! `
`It's impossible to always prove an alibi for each person X outside of the first 18! `
`...How do you like that, Beato...?! `
`Now that I know we're having a battle with twisted logic, I won't lose!" `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!! `
`How foolish... `
`Who do you think I am? `
`I am the Endless Witch! `
`The thought that you could challenge me endlessly is just absurd. `
`Endless control means that I am able to kill endlessly." `
`"...When your 19th person folds, you will summon a 20th, `
`and when your 20th person folds, you will summon a 21st, `
`and when your 21 person folds and your 22nd person folds, `
`you will summon a 23rd person, a 34th person, a 64358223579673204th person! `
`Did you think you'd have me at your mercy for all eternity?!" `
`"I laugh at 'infinite regress'! `
`The 'infinite' doesn't work against me!!" `
`"Well then, how will you kill my 'endless'? Just try and show me!!" `
`" `
`{p:1:I have the power to speak the truth in red}!!!" `
`".........!! `
`......Here it comes......" `
`"When I speak in red, it will contain absolutely no illusions. `
`If I say once in red that there are no more than 100 people on this island, `
`you will no longer be permitted to create a 101st person. `
`*cackle*cackle*! `
`See, Battleeer? `
`What truth shall I tell in red this time? `
`Where shall I strike for the kill and force you into hopelessness? `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*! `
`Come, show me your usual frightened face..." `
`"........." `
`".........What?" `
`"...Ihihihihi." `
`"...Why...are you laughing...?" `
`I wonder what kind of creepy look I had on my face as I laughed right then. `
`That red sure is scary. `
`...Every time it jumps out, I'm driven into the depths of hopelessness. `
`But...I've already realized something. `
`...There's no need to be overly afraid of the red. `
`"......You've brought out your trump card again. `
`So...? `
`How and for what will Beatrice-sama use the red this time?" `
`"...Hoh. `
`What do you mean by that? `
`Suddenly looking so relaxed..." `
`"Sorry, but I was waiting for you to take out that blood-red treasured sword of yours. `
`...Let's see, what'll you proclaim in red this time? `
`You aren't going to say 'the culprit was one of those 18 people', are you? `
`Be careful, since that'd mean self-destruction for you, right? `
`That'd be the same as throwing away your own witch theory yourself. `
`A complete resignation." `
`That's right, `
`the red wasn't always a weapon that worked in Beato's favor alone. `
`It was the other way around. `
`If she used it the wrong way, it was dangerous enough that she could bring about her own death. `
`If she used it carelessly and said something that ended up denying herself, that'd be exactly the same as self-destructing. `
`"Of course, it'd be sad and difficult for me to accept if you told me in red that one of the 18 was the culprit. `
`...No matter who the culprit actually was, I'd definitely have to deal with some tough emotions..." `
`"But before that, it would mean your defeat! `
`Saying in red that the culprit is a human is equivalent to your proclamation of resignation!! `
`If you want to strike me a blow so badly you're prepared to die at the same time, I think that's a pretty interesting move. `
`However, this battle will end in my victory!!" `
`Beatrice's red was her true trump card. `
`When that person speaks in red, it's definitely the truth, and no amount of proof or counterarguments can change that. `
`Until now, she's used that to severely wound me, and each time, the tiny foundations supporting my heart get split in half. `
`However, if she uses it carelessly, then I can also gleam a little information about the truth. `
`...In the last game, I used that to my advantage, especially during the chapel's closed room trick, `
`and almost completely got her boxed in at one point. `
`But she was pretty sly herself. `
`She learned from experience, and since then, she's started using discretion in the timing of her red... `
`This feeling of tension was almost literally like a battle with real swords. `
`...This is a high-level intellectual battle. `
`...No, not an intellectual battle. `
`This really is twisted logic. `
`This was the world's craziest and worst battle of twisted logic...!! `
`"Okay, now it's time to hear your plan. `
`...That's right. `
`To use your 'Hempel's Raven', `
`first, you'll have to confirm in red how many humans there are other than the 18. `
`And after that, if you proclaim in red that none of the people in this group are the culprit... `
`that's right, that might be a fatal wound to me." `
`"......I'm surprised that you no longer have even an atom of fear for the red, which once terrified you so much... `
`You're quite resilient." `
`"Try taking it out. `
`That treasured sword, that trump card of yours. `
`This time, you might be able to make me surrender with a single stroke, right...?" `
`"...*cackle*cackle*cackle* `
`...Interesting. `
`I wouldn't have it any other way..." `
`Agitate her. `
`Challenge her. `
`Drive her into a corner to make her speak in red... `
`Of course her red's always wiping out my only rays of hope. `
`But...don't be afraid of that. `
`On this island overcome with falsehoods and illusions, the only thing I can trust is... `
`the information she speaks in red. `
`It's my only way across the chasm of hell. `
`Just a single tightrope. `
`Her merciless blood-red blade is the only way I can survive. `
`...This isn't just walking on a tightrope, it's like literally walking on the edge of a blade... `
`Of course I'm afraid. `
`Because my victory condition is the denial of witches, then, to use her contrapositive logic, the culprit must be human. `
`But I didn't want to search for a culprit amid the 18. `
`...That's what made me stick to a weak position, since I had to claim both that it couldn't be a witch and that it couldn't be one of the 18. `
`Last time, I was unable to understand that, so that's where she hit me, leaving me tattered and defeated. `
`...But that's okay. `
`Let her hit me. `
`Let her attack. `
`No problem... `
`Someone said it once in an old sword-fighting movie. `
`That 'A good fortress has one, and only one, intentionally weak point'. `
`The enemy would gather there. `
`They would be lured there. `
`And that would be where the actual battle took place. `
`...As long as I understood my weak points, `
`and as long as she wanted to attack those weak points, `
`...it was as if I were luring her into launching an attack there... `
`Gauge the distance between us with care, ...retreating step by step. `
`Make them move forward. `
`The more she recklessly flourished that red, the more chances I would get to strike back. `
`Don't be afraid of the red. `
`Keep her cornered, so that she'll have no choice but to refute me with the red...! `
`No matter how oppressively she speaks in red, `
`...that's right, that red itself is the same as fresh blood leaking from her wounds. `
`"So, `
`...what's wrong? `
`...First of all, why don't you tell me how many people are on this island total? `
`If you don't, your raven can't cut me up...!" `
`".........Hmph. `
`...How surprising that you can be this desperate and yet this difficult. `
`...One cannot make light of someone putting their life on the line, no matter what the era. `
`...It's no surprise you're Kinzo's grandchild. `
`The more cornered you are, `
`......the bolder you become!" `
`"...Ihihihi..." `
`Ronove cleared his throat. `
`"It appears to be a stalemate. `
`That black tea I worked so hard to make is getting cold, `
`Milady." `
`"......Nng." `
`Ronove, who was supposed to be her ally, roguishly rushed her into making her next move. `
`Beato probably thought she'd managed to smile back and appear confident, ...but she couldn't hide the sweat building up on her forehead. `
`By now, she had completely lost the confident feeling that had allowed her to turn her nose up at her worthless opponent. `
`Of course, she probably wouldn't be cornered by something like this. `
`...She's just being cautious. `
`Until now, I've been inexperienced. `
`I didn't know how to fight, and I wasn't strong enough to be her opponent. `
`However, now that we've reached the third game, she's realized that I'm starting to become more skilled, `
`and she's grown more cautious, thinking every move over carefully... `
`Sure, that's just fine, Beatrice. `
`Sorry to keep you waiting. `
`Are you happy now...? `
`"...Now it's starting to get interesting, huh...? `
`Hihihihi!" `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*! `
`...Battleeeeeeeeer..." `
`"This isn't getting us anywhere... `
`Then, should we get to the heart of the matter and go with the usual?" `
`"...Hoh. `
`The usual, you say? `
`...Then, by all means. `
`If I don't hear you say that, I guess I just won't feel like starting..." `
`The first move was mine... `
`"Here I go, Beato. `
`Repeat it. `
`...'On this island, there are only 18 people'." `
`"............" `
`"...If I hear you say this in red, I'll have no choice but to suspect one of the 18. `
`...I won't be able to say a 19th person did it, so all doors will be closed to me. `
`......However, I believe the culprit definitely isn't one of the 18! `
`There's no way any of those 18 could commit such brutal murders...!!" `
`"........." `
`"I'll say it again. `
`Repeat it! `
`'On this island, there are only 18 people'." `
`"............ `
`......I refuse. `
`I won't say why." `
`Whew...! `
`I'd avoided what would've been the worst red for me. `
`If she'd repeated that, `
`I'd be faced with those two worst choices of accepting the witch or suspecting one of the 18, `
`like last time all over again... `
`But Beato hadn't proclaimed my ultimate and greatest weakness in red. `
`She refused to repeat it, even though there was no reason for her not to strike, even though it was a weakness she should've been drooling at. `
`She hadn't sliced me up with red by using that move, which should've been as good as forking a rook and the king...! `
`...This was a big sign of my advantage. `
`That's right. `
`The culprit isn't one of the 18. `
`I won't suspect anyone...! `
`And since the culprit isn't a witch either, `
`......it means a 19th person exists on this island. `
`And that's you. `
`A person who, as Grandfather's mistress of 30 years, `
`has been secretly living in a hidden mansion in the forest for a long, long time. `
`The 'human' Beatrice......!! `
`"That's right. `
`You aren't a witch or anything like it. `
`...You're just a human...who's been living on this island in hiding for several decades...!" `
`"......*cackle*cackle* `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle... `
`...Did you just call me, the Endless Witch who has lived for over one thousand years, a human? `
`...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!" `
`For a while, Beatrice continued to laugh unpleasantly and gloatingly...or maybe spitefully. `
`"...Are you ready? I'll keep going. `
`...Again, repeat it. `
`'There are 19 people or more on this island'!" `
`"............" `
`Beatrice fell silent once again. `
`She'd probably remain extremely cautious `
`as long as confirming the number of humans on this `
`island might give her some large disadvantage, `
`depending on the situation. `
`The red has already become a foothold for my counterattacks. `
`Now that we know this, it makes the red very risky for the witch. `
`But if she couldn't repeat this, her 'Hempel's Raven' wouldn't be effective. `
`To break my 'Devil's Proof', `
`she would need to settle the existence and number of people outside the 18 in red. `
`That's right. `
`She couldn't break the existence of a 19th person unless she used red. `
`I've {i:closed Beato in}, giving her no choice but to speak in red...! `
`There really was... `
`...a way to fight... `
`in this witch's game! `
`"It's okay to refuse. `
`...If you can't say it in red, that means there's a total of 18+X people on this island." `
`"...That X is a pretty massive piece to lose on your first move, right? `
`After all, from now on, all of the tricks that were impossible for the 18... `
`can be explained with a human X who isn't in that group. `
`...This huge piece can break open all the rooms you said were closed because everyone had an alibi...!" `
`It was just like `
`how a chess bishop can cut a thin line through enemy forces as long as there's a slight gap. `
`It could only be effectively used on squares of the same color, but it was very good at controlling territory on the board. `
`"............ `
`......Nng." `
`It looked like Beato also noticed her current plight. `
`She couldn't just let such an important piece go, especially this close to the beginning of the game... `
`If she pulled out her red treasured sword, it wouldn't be that difficult to save herself from this. `
`...But Beato was completely aware that I was expecting it. `
`She was afraid that a careless red truth might end up strangling her own neck...! `
`Because...in the first place, a witch is something that ought to be denied in red. `
`Believe. `
`Don't doubt! `
`Witches don't exist! `
`Something like that couldn't exist in this world. `
`They can only exist in the valleys between truths. `
`...They have a fragile existence, curled up in these cracks, frantically trying to protect themselves from the brutal winds of truth, `
`and they can only barely exist like a mirage by surviving on falsehoods and illusions. `
`In other words, the red, which only witches can use, is the reality that might easily deny their very being. `
`...The more they brandish their red words, `
`...the more they begin to lose bit by bit that crack in truth inside which they can endure. `
`That's why they don't want to use red words and carelessly lose that crack in truth, which is based on fuzzy information... `
`or illusions, in other words. `
`That's because they understand that they're gradually being cornered. `
`Of course, that bastard will never admit it. `
`Because, if she did, `
`it'd be the same as admitting that she's something that can't exist in this world, like an imaginary number. `
`Don't be afraid. `
`Stay strong...! `
`I know that she's the one who's really been pierced to the bone. `
`After all, her red treasured sword can't be used without a lot of preparation...! `
`"...What's wrong? `
`I'll say it again. `
`...Repeat it! `
`"‘There are at least 19 people on this island’!" `
`"......... `
`...Hmph. `
`...I refuse." `
`At the end of Beato's worrying, `
`...she took a single deep breath and quietly announced her refusal. `
`...I thought she'd use it. `
`But Beato refused to speak in red, even though it would cost her victory in the opening part of the game. `
`"You refused...? `
`Which means that, from now on, `
`I can create as many fictional character Xs outside of the 18 as I want...?" `
`"Do as you wish. `
`...I have refused to repeat what you have told me. `
`Isn't that enough for now? `
`...The reason for my refusal is... `
`... `
`...no, I won't tell you yet. `
`Anyway, you'll know soon enough." `
`"...Ihihi. `
`Still acting tough, I see..." `
`"...Choosing not to use the red is another way of using it. `
`You called it my red treasured sword. `
`A pleasant metaphor. `
`I will use it too. `
`...A treasured sword is at its best when it is sheathed. `
`In fact, there are times it can instill even more fear because it is sheathed." `
`"That's right. `
`...As I fight, I always have to keep in mind whether you might spin everything around with those red words. `
`It's some pretty serious pressure." `
`"...And there are also times when you make things pretty tough by refusing to repeat after me. `
`...Those times, I can't tell if you can't repeat because my guess was right, `
`or if you're just misleading me and letting me flounder about. `
`If you think of it that way, yeah. `
`It's a sheathed treasured sword." `
`"......So what? `
`If I'm going to push you off a cliff anyway, best to let you climb a bit higher first. `
`...We have still barely begun. `
`Much is left to come..." `
`"I'll resign from this challenge. `
`...Go and get drunk on your faint victory for now. `
`...But only for now." `
`Practically speaking, the early part of the game ended with her being a sore loser. `
`Even so, I couldn't relax my guard at all. `
`...That tension didn't fade one bit...until I was greeted by the sound of Ronove's applause... `
`"...Spectacular, Battler-sama. `
`Perhaps you have started this game with an advantageous development." `
`"Who knows... `
`I still don't know whether I've taken a piece by my move, `
`or whether she guided me into taking it. `
`...After all, knowing you... `
`You probably know I'm being led into a trap, and that clapping is just you mocking me openly, right...?" `
`"How could you think that? `
`I am innocently celebrating your ability, which has enabled you to take one shot at Milady, even though it is only the first round. `
`...In any event, Milady is a person who is quick to become arrogant. `
`I believe that a little encouragement such as this can be good medicine every once in a while." `
`"...This butler of yours sure has a vicious tongue..." `
`"He does, doesn't he? `
`Sometimes he ticks me off as well." `
`"My, my, how incredibly rude of me. `
`Well then, Milady, Battler-sama. `
`How would you like some more black tea? `
`The game has still barely begun. `
`Please allow me to prepare all the tea and snacks needed to adorn this game. `
`I ask that you continue your game without any reservations." `
`"I will. `
`Let's move forward. `
`Now is when it really starts." `
`"......Hmph. `
`Very well. `
`Let us advance the clock. `
`Ronove, black tea please." `
`"Certainly. `
`How about a cookie?" `
`"I don't need one. `
`Give it to Beelzebub to keep her happy. `
`......Remain silent for now." `
`While listening to the sound of the demon butler pouring tea, the witch closed her eyes slightly and fell silent. `
`...For some time, she was deeply lost in thought, but eventually a roguish glint came into her eyes. `
`"Very well. `
`......Why don't I inform you now as to why I refused to speak in red during that first move?" `
`"...What...? `
`Bring it on. `
`Show me what you've got." `
`"*cackle*cackle*... `
`Yes, that piece really was big enough that I'd hate to lose it. `
`...It may be hasty, but allow me to make my move. `
`I won't use the red, but from here on, Rosa will explain on my behalf. `
`Listen." `
`"Of course, I think the same way. `
`Rosa does too, right? `
`......Rosa?" `
`"Huh? Ah, sorry... `
`M-Me too. `
`I think that too." `
`"......What's wrong, Rosa-san? `
`...You've been really quiet for a while now. `
`Are you feelin' sick...?" `
`From the beginning, Rosa had never been one to cut in on the siblings' fights. `
`...But even so, she seemed unmotivated... `
`and had said almost nothing during this night's conference. `
`The whole time, she had hung her head...and appeared to be thinking of something else... `
`"You've been in a daze for a while now. `
`Do you think you can protect the inheritance like that? `
`You're also the mother of your child, so get a stronger hold on yourself." `
`"I-I'm sorry..." `
`"Did you wake up really early in the morning? `
`If you feel sick, you shouldn't overdo it." `
`"...The beds in our guest rooms have been prepared. `
`How about taking a rest? `
`I will guide you." `
`"No, ...I'm fine. `
`Thank you." `
`"...What is it? `
`Is there something you're worrying about?" `
`"......No, not really......" `
`"Is that so...? `
`It feels like your mind has been elsewhere this whole time. `
`...I wonder if that has anything to do with what we've been talking about...?" `
`At those words, everyone stared at Rosa together. `
`As if in response, Rosa's shoulders quivered. `
`Apparently, Kyrie's guess hadn't been wrong. `
`...Rosa couldn't deny it either... `
`".........No, umm... `
`............" `
`She swallowed whatever it was she had been trying to say and went silent again. `
`Of course, the other siblings also began to realize that something about her appearance was different from usual... `
`"What is it? `
`...You've been weird for a while. `
`Did you think of something...?" `
`"We all just swore to remain united, didn't we? `
`Don't hold back, worryin' by yourself. `
`We said we'd talk." `
`"...Rosa, `
`tell us." `
`The men pressed her one after the other, and Rosa confessed resignedly and nervously... `
`The atmosphere made it seem as though she was `
`confessing to some modest prank, `
`which had inadvertently brought about a serious situation. `
`"No, umm... `
`...Th-This mistress of Grandfather's, this Beatrice... `
`...I was wondering if she's still... `
`alive..." `
`"Huh? `
`Isn't it obvious that she's alive? `
`After all, she was able to send that letter to us." `
`"Whether she's in good health or not is a different story though. `
`The woman in that portrait must be getting up there in age by now." `
`"I'd say she's healthy. `
`People who are crafty when it comes to money stay healthy no matter how old they get! `
`Her evil plan might even be the best rejuvenating agent. `
`Wahahaha." `
`"...She shouldn't be... `
`alive." `
`"Huh? `
`...What did you just say?" `
`"Beatrice is... `
`...dead... `
`......I- `
`I killed her...!" `
`"Wh-What did you say...?!" `
`"...Wh-What do you mean, Rosa...?!" `
`"B-But it wasn't really me who killed her... `
`...Th-Though I did bring her to a place like that! `
`...No, I did kill her after all... `
`I tried to make myself believe it was a dream!! `
`...But...it wasn't really a dream, was it?! `
`Which makes this...a letter from Beatrice's ghost!! `
`Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!" `
`It was so sudden that everyone was lost for words. `
`Rosa kept on talking, unable to stop, holding her head as her hair flew all about... `
`"Calm yourself...! `
`Rosa-san...!" `
`"I-I have absolutely no clue what's goin' on...! `
`Already dead? `
`What do ya mean...?!" `
`"...I think it means two things. `
`First, ...its literal meaning. `
`...And second, it backs up our earlier guess." `
`"Which means... `
`......Rosa...has met with Beatrice, right?" `
`"I-I've never heard Rosa mention anything like this. `
`...Rosa, when was it? `
`When could you possibly have met Beatrice?!" `
`"Long ago! `
`Long, long, long ago!! `
`We'd just moved over to the island and I was still young!! `
`It wasn't my fault, it's not like I killed her...!! `
`Whaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!" `
`"...Calm down! `
`Nobody's blaming you for anything, right? `
`First, drink some water. `
`Okay? `
`Natsuhi-san, the pitcher please." `
`"Y-Yes. `
`......Here you go, Rosa-san. `
`Please, calm yourself..." `
`"............" `
`Until Rosa was able to calm her ragged breathing, ...no one was able to speak a word... `
