`"...What, you mean six years ago? `
`I mean, I was still in elementary school back then, right? `
`It's pretty unfair to expect me to remember everything, don't you think?" `
`"True. `
`Especially because we were so young, we've grown a lot in these six years. `
`If I hadn't been introduced, I might not even have remembered you." `
`"Really? `
`I figured he was Battler right away. `
`And when he opened his mouth, I was sure." `
`"Uu-. `
`I just met him for the first time. `
`Didn't know him six years ago." `
`"That's right. `
`Maria-sama was only three years old then." `
`"Well, the same goes for me. `
`I only knew Maria when she was three years old, and since she's grown so big, of course I wouldn't recognize her." `
`After lunch, we had all gone out to the beach to walk around, talk, and take it easy. `
`Our parents were apparently having a suspicious, complicated discussion, so we ended up leaving them behind. `
`...Well, just as I'd guessed from the start, the conversation focused on me, since I'd been away for six years. `
`"Still, you've really gotten tall. `
`I wouldn't call myself short, but your height really surprised me." `
`"That's right. I remember well what Battler-sama was like six years ago, but I was surprised even so." `
`"Yeah, seriously. `
`I can hardly believe this is the same Battler we knew back then." `
`"I'm surprised how much everyone remembers about it. `
`My memory's all hazy." `
`"Yeah, I'll bet. `
`Looks like it's taking you a while to remember us. `
`You know, that hurts a bit." `
`"Come on, this was six years ago, right? `
`I'm the one who has it bad, being forced to remember...!" `
`"...Are you saying that you can't remember well because it was six years ago? `
`I can remember it as clearly as if it happened yesterday..." `
`"Well, your memory's great, after all. `
`You remember the kind of things Battler did and said back then pretty clearly, don't you?" `
`"Come to think of it, that's right. `
`Shannon's memory can be incredible when you'd least expect it." `
`"Uu-. `
`I'm horrible at remembering. `
`I remember fun things, but can't remember boring things at all. `
`Uu-." `
`We all laughed, saying that everyone was like that. `
`"Shannon. `
`By the way, what was Battler like six years ago? `
`Remember any interesting episodes?" `
`"Let's see. `
`...I'm sure that he said something like this when he left. `
`'I'll be back, <see you again>. `
`I'll surely come for you riding a white horse'." `
`"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, `
`stop iiiiiiiiit, so embarassiiiiiiiiiiing!!" `
`"Gyaaahahahahaha!! `
`Sounds just like something you'd say! `
`Yeah, I remember you always used to be full of those stupid lines, Battler! `
`Waaahahahhaha!!" `
`"Hahahaha. `
`It really does sound like something Battler-kun would've said back then." `
`"Uu-. `
`Embarrassing? Is that embarrassing?" `
`"...Yeah. `
`Horribly embarrassing... `
`Maria, I'm sure that when you're in middle school, you'll want to say embarrassing stuff like that... `
`When that happens, make sure you write it down and read it three times before saying it out loud. `
`If you don't, you'll definitely regret it..." `
`"Still, everyone has to pass through that pitiful period... `
`That's right, that's how you learn your place, learn shame, and become an adult. `
`Yeah, it's one of those bittersweet things everyone does in adolescence as they transition to becoming adults, a memory you just wanna forget... `
`Aarrggwaaahhh..." `
`After all, this was all stuff I'd let slip out without thinking, so I didn't remember the words exactly. `
`But now that those words were being recited to me, they were as embarrassing as all hell. `
`I only recently came to understand this weakness...and was working hard to avoid such careless outbursts, but... `
`...I guess I was just born with the habit of speaking without thinking, and there's nothing I can do about it. `
`"Shannooon, do you remember any other embarrassing stuff?" `
`"Yes, well... I remember a few other things, but... `
`since it looks like the person in question wants to forget them, I think I'll refrain from saying any more..." `
`"To be brutally honest, I don't remember this at all. `
`Please, don't make me remembeeer." `
`"...Uu-. `
`Shannon's bullying Battler...? `
`Uu-. `
`You can't. `
`You shouldn't bully people." `
`"Hahahahaha. She isn't really bullying him. `
`Let's leave it at that, okay? `
`But Shannon, you'll have tell me all about it sometime Battler isn't around. `
`It sounds pretty interesting." `
`"Yes, certainly." `
`"N-No, you can't, Shannon-chaaaaaaaaaan...!!" `
`For a while, George-aniki laughed at me, as though warming up for when Shannon-chan would tell him about more of my embarrassing misspeaks. `
`George looked like he was flirting with Shannon, `
`...but he seemed somewhat open and frank about it. `
`He was always that way with his cousins, but he usually took on a reserved, gentlemanly attitude when he came in contact with the servants. `
`...When I thought about it, I got the feeling he was being a bit overly friendly, which seemed strange. `
`Maria started scribbling in the sand with a stick, and George-aniki and Shannon-chan joined in. `
`This left me and Jessica off to the side, so I asked her secretively. `
`"...Hey, Jessica. `
`Is George-aniki...umm, going out with Shannon-chan?" `
`"Ooooh? `
`What the, how'd you guess?! `
`Battler, you've got a keener eye for people than I thought." `
`"Huh, ...whaaaaaaat?! `
`I was just kidding, ...but they're actually going out?!" `
`"Shhh! `
`Your voice is too loud! `
`...It looks like they're keeping it secret for now, okay? `
`It'd be better if nobody found out about it, especially Aunt Eva." `
`"I-I see... `
`Love with a servant, huh...? `
`...Y-Yeah, but, since when? `
`Whew, I guess a lot can happen in six years... `
`But yeah, Aniki's an amazing person, and Shannon-chan seems to be kind and brave, `
`...so they might make a pretty good match." `
`Actually, six years ago, I remember taking notice of her just a little bit. `
`I see, she really fits well with George-aniki, nothing I can do about that. `
`...Goodbye, my fleeting first love of six years ago... `
`......Which means that...the collection of embarrassing lines Shannon-chan had just held back on... `
`probably had something to do with that... `
`Aaaaaaaaaaarrghh, I can't take it... `
`"How long have they been going out?" `
`"That depends on what you call going out, but I think it's been at least a year. `
`But if you count the time they both had one-sided feelings, it'd probably be several years." `
`Before I'd realized it, the two of them had separated themselves from the group and were walking down the beach, talking about something. `
`...They looked calm, `
`and rather than a light relationship between two lovers, it looked like a more serious one, as though they were already engaged. `
`"...Six years ago, huh? `
`That's a long time. `
`What did those six years mean to me? `
`I've just gotten taller. `
`It was just a waste of time, six years I spent obstinately fighting with my dad." `
`"What about you, Battler? `
`You got a girlfriend?" `
`"Hmm, I wonder. `
`There's a few girls that I have fun with. `
`But there's no 'only one'. `
`...I guess I'm just a kid. `
`I think it's more fun to be noisy with a large group of people than being alone with one person." `
`"Aah, that's so you, Battler. `
`But take your relationships with your female friends seriously. `
`When girls get wrong impressions or form a group, it can be scary, you know? `
`They might be having secret feuds over you behind your back, with people getting hurt or crying." `
`"That's so weird. `
`I think I remember getting the same bit of advice from one of the girls in my class just last week. `
`...What's this all about? `
`Why can't everyone just have fun together? `
`Do people really want to couple up that much?" `
`"...It's probably because you've never found a partner like that, Battler. `
`Well, you might run into someone sooner or later. `
`You've just gotta wait patiently!" `
`"What? `
`It almost sounds like you've already found a partner like that. `
`What about you? `
`Have you gotten a boyfriend?" `
`"Huh?! `
`M-Me?! `
`No, err, wahahahahaha..." `
`"Come on, that reaction's so easy to understand... `
`From the looks of it, there's some boy you're thinking about, but you haven't been able to confess to him yet, something like that." `
`"N-No, umm, that's not, umm, uh! `
`Sh-Shut up, who cares about that...!" `
`"If you're the one who brought up this subject, why are you yelling at me now? `
`Women are creatures who always ask questions, and yet almost never answer them. `
`What cruel creatures, seriously." `
`"...W-Well, umm. `
`...I did try... `
`to confess once. `
`Well, umm, I struck out pretty badly." `
`"Did you get an 'I'm sorry'?" `
`"No, umm, ... `
`...well, uh, my feelings were seriously one-sided, and they didn't really know how to respond, I guess... `
`It was like they didn't view me that way at all." `
`"Well, I can understand that. `
`You talk like a man, after all. `
`If you don't act a bit more graceful, you won't be able to catch a boy's interest." `
`"I-I-Is it really... `
`...Is the way I speak... `
`really that bad?" `
`"...Hmm? `
`Well, umm, how you talk isn't everything, but when people like you, who usually have a rough style of speech, `
`suddenly start working hard to talk more normally... well, there are guys out there whose heart'll skip a beat when they see how determined you are." `
`"I-Is that really true...? `
`I see, `
`...yeah..." `
`Jessica suddenly started talking more meekly, and then her face instantly went slightly red. `
`...I see, even though her confession didn't go well, it looks like she still hasn't given up. `
`But still, I get it. `
`After seeing how close George-aniki and Shannon-chan have gotten, I also kinda want to find a girlfriend. `
`Six years. `
`...Six years of puberty are pretty important, and they went by pretty fast. `
`As the typhoon approached, the clouds grew steadily grayer, but even so, I had this really refreshing feeling. `
`...Maybe I'll try thinking more seriously about the opposite sex, more than just the size of their boobs... `
`"By the way, `
`it looks like George-aniki's going out with a servant. `
`...Don't tell me it's the same for you?" `
`"Huh, ...whaaaat?!?! `
`Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Why do you think that...?!" `
`"Come to think of it, that kid Kanon-kun, who greeted us in the rose garden... `
`You were covering for him pretty intensely, considering he was just a little awkward at talking." `
`"N-No, that's not... `
`Wahahahaha, now you're getting paranoid...!!" `
`"Then tell me just one thing. `
`Right now, `
`is the boy you're after within one kilometer of this spot?" `
`"W-Well about that, umm, ...I-I-I wonder..." `
`Kanon-kun was the only boy on this island now who could possibly become her boyfriend. `
`So, judging by her reaction, I was right on. `
`I didn't think of the Ushiromiya family as a noble family, ...but love with a servant... `
`I wouldn't have dreamed that two pairs of Romeo and Juliet would be right next to me... `
`Aunt Eva would probably become an obstacle to George-aniki and Shannon-chan's love. `
`If Aunt Eva ever learned that Shannon-chan was the partner of her only beloved son, `
`she'd probably scream at her for trying to steal away her precious George. `
`And a relationship between Jessica and Kanon-kun would probably be just as full of difficulties. `
`Aunt Natsuhi was also very strict about that kind of thing. `
`...After all, Jessica's husband would probably become the Head of the Ushiromiya family in the future. `
`If that person had once been a servant working for the family...well, things would get complicated. `
`"Well, love is different for every person. `
`As long as you're with someone who's fun to be around, does anything else matter? `
`When two people pair up, they don't need anyone's permission, as long as they accept each other. `
`Worrying about what your parents or family will say means you've already lost. `
`Don't forget that. `
`You'd better not go out with someone with mixed feelings." `
`"...Tch... `
`I can't believe you're saying something so philosophical-sounding when you haven't even been in love." `
`"Don't treat love like a matter of profit and loss. `
`It's about heart. `
`That's all I have to say. `
`Well then, `
`<see you again, have a nice day>." `
`"...Pfft, `
`...wahhahhahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`George nii-san, Shanno-n, listen, liste-n! `
`This guy, he's said another one of those lines!!" `
`"I didn't say anything, I didn't say anything!! `
`Waaah, don't make fun of me, don't make fun of me!!" `
`"Uu-, I heard it! `
`<See you aga-in>, <see you aga-in>!!" `
`For a while, we forgot that the wind was getting stronger and played around on the beach. `
`...I grew a lot these past six years...and being able to celebrate my youth and meet with all of my cousins was truly refreshing. `
`...It was a bit late now, but I realized that I should've gotten back together with everyone a lot sooner, and returned to the Ushiromiya family... `
`"It sure is nice to have all the cousins together every once in a while..." `
`"Uu-! `
`I like it too! It's really fun when all the cousins get together!" `
`"That's right. `
`We're already old enough. `
`It's not like we couldn't meet each other when our parents aren't around. `
`...It might not be a bad idea to gather the cousins together and play every once in a while." `
`"That's a good plan. `
`Maybe we should set up something like that the next time we get a chance." `
`"Yeah, I agree. `
`I hope we cousins can stay friends forever." `
`"Hey, hey, if you make such a big deal of it, you almost make it sound like relatives usually end up hating each other." `
`"Hahahahahaha." `
`George-aniki and Jessica laughed, but it felt just a little strained. `
`...Did I say something wrong? `
`Judging by how our parents made quiet expressions and tired faces every once in a while during the boat ride and at the airport, maybe I should've kept that to myself. `
`"...You're right. `
`It's just like Jessica said. `
`Let's always be friends to each other." `
`"Uu-! `
`Me too! `
`We're all friends!!" `
`"That's right. `
`Yeah. `
`We'll always be together. `
`We'll always be friends." `
`"Heheh. `
`Man, we've been saying some pretty embarrassing stuff. `
`I feel kinda awkward." `
`"But I think it's very important. `
`People are creatures who find it very hard to stay together, much less remain friends, unless they truly desire it." `
`"That's right. `
`You really can't take everyone being friendly for granted." `
`"Uu-. `
`A witch I know said it. `
`Happiness won't be granted unless everyone believes in it." `
`"That's true. `
`Maybe some magic exists in the power of belief. `
`If we all believe in that, I'm sure it will bring us happiness." `
`"All right. `
`Well, if we're doing embarrassing stuff already... `
`Let's all swear to believe in this together, okay? `
`That we'll all always be friendly, that we'll always be happy." `
`Like hell we'll end up like our parents. `
`As if we'd ever search for each other's weaknesses, going after Grandfather's fortune... `
`"Okay! `
`We'll always be friendly and happy. `
`Let's all believe in that." `
`No matter how much we cousins tried to nostalgically have fun, dark clouds continued to approach Rokkenjima. `
`...I wonder if the typhoon will pass and let us see the clear skies before we leave this island. `
`Who cares about what our parents are planning? `
`Who cares about the inheritance and the honor of our old family? `
`As youthful as we were, we were renewing our old friendship. `
`And we all believed together that we could find happiness. `
`So... `
`I want this pair of days to end... `
`without anything weird happening, `
`in peace and happiness... `
`and calmly... `
`No, ...I don't just want them to end. `
`...Please, let them end...! `
`"In your dreeeeeeeeeeeams! `
`Kyah-hahah-hah-hah-hahahahahahahahahahaha!!" `
`"Damn iiiiiiiit!! `
`Don't show up, don't appear!! `
`Dammit, dammit, dammit!!" `
`"Sorry to keep you waiting. `
`I've finally prepared a new game. `
`Come, let us begin this tale of tragedy! `
`Come to me, winds, rain, typhoon! `
`Cut this island off from the real world!! `
`Throw Rokkenjima into another realm, into the spirit world, into a world of fantasy!" `
`And so, the tale repeated for the third time. `
`However, to an Endless Witch, `
`what did it matter whether it was the first, second, or third time? `
`It probably didn't matter at all. `
`After all, this was a tale of fantasy, endlessly repeating until the match was settled. Would Battler surrender first, or would the witch? `
`Then the sky grew dark and cloudy, and the rain and wind were summoned together and became a typhoon... `
`Maria could be seen in the rose garden, paying no mind to the rain that had started falling, `
`going around in circles, searching for that single rose that should have been marked... `
`"......Not here... `
`Not here... `
`My rose... `
`that we marked...isn't here, `
`...uu-. `
`......Uu-!!" `
`Maria definitely remembered it. `
`That rose had been in the flower bed right here. `
`And yet, it wasn't anymore. `
`She didn't know what to do with her irritation at not being able to find something that should've been there, `
`and, moaning bitterly, she couldn't help but keep going back and forth in circles around the same spot. `
`She was acting almost as though she'd be able to see it if she looked at a different angle, `
`but even though she did that, there was no way to find something that wasn't there... `
`The wind grew increasingly strong, and the rain turned into cold, large drops. `
`There was no way even Maria would fail to notice this. `
`However, if she couldn't find her rose here, it would surely disappear forever. `
`...Maria believed that. `
`That feeling spurred her on to keep searching for a rose that she had no chance of finding... `
`Just then, the cold drops of rain tormenting Maria were suddenly blocked. `
`".........Uu-?" `
`Maria raised her head. `
`...When she did, she saw an umbrella there, protecting her from the rain... `
`And the one holding out that umbrella was... `
`...the witch she admired, Beatrice. `
`"Beatrice...!!" `
`"What are you doing so frantically in the middle of all this rain? `
`You could catch a cold like this. `
`Even witches have to care for their own health." `
`"I... `
`...can't find... `
`my rose... `
`...Uu-. `
`No matter how many times I search, `
`...even though it should've been here, `
`...I can't find it..." `
`Maria told Beatrice about how there had been a slightly unhealthy, pitiful rose, `
`and that she was sure they had marked it. `
`"Hoho. `
`So you can't find it. `
`......If you are a witch's apprentice, you should use magic to search for the rose. `
`I believe that searching with just your eyes won't be nearly enough." `
`"...Uu-. `
`...I can't find it. `
`...I did my best and tried to search with magic, but I can't find it..." `
`"I think practicing your magic is a very good thing, but it might be a little too much for you with all this wind and rain. `
`...Allow me to lend you some special power. `
`Concern for one's disciples is also one of a teacher's duties." `
`"Th-Thank yooou, `
`Beatrice!!" `
`Maria's face, which had been full of sadness until just now, split open into a grin. `
`Maria knew. `
`She knew that there was nothing Beatrice's magic couldn't do. `
`So she was sure that Beatrice would be able to find the rose easily, even though Maria couldn't... `
`Beatrice closed her eyes lightly, acting as though she was listening for something in all this wind and rain. `
`Then she heard it, opened her eyes, and spoke. `
`"......Hmm. `
`All things in this world are transitory. `
`Too bad, Maria. `
`...It seems your rose couldn't withstand all of this wind and rain." `
`"Uu-... `
`Then, my rose......?" `
`"It was uprooted by the wind...and is no longer of this world." `
`".........Uu-..." `
`What Beatrice had said was quite reasonable. `
`...There was nothing odd about the flower being broken off at the stem in this strong wind. `
`...However, Maria couldn't accept this and bitterly gave a low-pitched moan... `
`"......No." `
`"Hoh?" `
`"...No, no, no! `
`It's my rose!! `
`My rose won't come back, no! `
`I'll bring it back to life with my magic. `
`Beatrice, teach me how to revive a rose with magic...!!" `
`"Ha! `
`It's much too early for an apprentice like you to learn the hidden art of Endless Magic. `
`Know your place." `
`".........Uuuuuu." `
`Maria wiped the tears from her eyes, full of regret. `
`Beatrice shrugged her shoulders and chuckled at Maria's pitiable expression. `
`"Very well. `
`I will lend you my power, the hidden art that can revive a rose." `
`"Really?!" `
`"Indeed. `
`...Well then, concentrate the power of your heart. `
`Close your eyes, forget the rain, forget the wind, and search for the soul of the wandering rose with the eyes of your heart." `
`"...Uu-." `
`Maria closed her eyes. `
`Then, she repeated Beatrice's song-like words... `
`"Come, try to remember. `
`Rose, what form did you have?" `
`"...Come, try to remember. `
`Rose, what form did you have...?" `
`"Don't look. `
`Don't listen. `
`And believe. `
`...Release the power of your soul from the cage of flesh that imprisons it. `
`......That's it. `
`...Good..." `
`Around Maria, who was concentrating her power, her eyes tightly shut, small golden butterflies began to dance. `
`...Was this the manifestation of the magical power Maria held? `
`"Lost soul of the rose. `
`Gather into one, and remember your form. `
`...Come, gather, remember..." `
`The glitter of the gold butterflies began to strengthen, and their numbers increased. Then, Beatrice raised a finger up to the skies, and they began to gather at the tip of that finger... `
`This was the miracle of the golden magic... `
`The gold butterflies began to condense into a single dazzling grain of gold. `
`...It was a single glittering gold seed. `
`It rode on the tip of Beatrice's finger, budded into a golden sprout, and opened into a golden leaf. `
`It then slowly fell from that fingertip, sank into the mud of the flower bed, and began to grow steadily... `
`...Maria, who admired magic and the witch, really wanted to see this fantastical sight. `
`However, as an apprentice, Maria was still not qualified to see it. `
`...No, she was probably afraid that, if she opened her eyes to look, the power that she had concentrated in her heart would be cut off, and the magic would be lost. `
`Therefore, Beatrice, as the only one permitted to witness this golden miracle, `
`was the only witch, the sole master of many miracles. `
`Then, the fully-grown rose bloomed, creating one golden flower. `
`And when Beatrice poked it with her finger in just the right way, `
`the gold-colored sparkle scattered, just as if a golden soap bubble had popped, and what remained was a single beautiful rose. `
`"...Hmm. `
`It looks like you've remembered a splendid rose. `
`...However, if we just leave it mixed in with these other roses, you won't be able to tell it apart. `
`Shall I perform one last service?" `
`Beatrice, for the sake of her cute apprentice who was moaning even more now in concentration, `
`decided to use one more bit of magic. `
`When she snapped her fingers, a single gold butterfly appeared, fluttered around, and landed on the flower that had just been revived. `
`Then it suddenly burst open and disappeared, becoming golden lace and marking the rose... `
`"That will do. `
`...Maria, `
`you may open your eyes now." `
`"......Uu-? `
`Where's the rose? `
`It's not here. `
`Not here." `
`"Not over there, over here. `
`...Look. `
`I've marked it with golden lace." `
`"Wah, ...you did...!! `
`Awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome!! `
`Thank you Beato, thank you Beato!! `
`I want to become a witch quickly, a Great Witch like you!!" `
`"And you can. `
`Long ago, I too wished for that innocently, just as you do, and I have attained that level." `
`Maria was ecstatic over the revived rose, clapping her hands and jumping around in joy. `
`...Watching that, Beatrice also smiled, looking fairly pleased. `
`By now, I can break and repair any soul if I try, not just that of a rose, and kill and revive as I pleased. `
`Come, the barrier of the storm has now sealed Rokkenjima off from the natural world. `
`Now is the time for the Golden Witch, Beatrice, to descend as an Endless Witch. `
`Beatrice pulled from her pocket an envelope with the family crest, the One-Winged Eagle, and gave it to Maria. `
`Maria frolicked around at being selected to be the witch's messenger. `
`"So, Kinzo, `
`I've come to join in on your fun once more... `
`My preparations are already complete. `
`What of you? `
`Have you prepared enough coins to bet in tonight's game...?" `
`"Of course. I'm fully prepared, Beatrice...!! `
`I've assembled a plethora of pieces. `
`I'm ready both physically and mentally! `
`So then, let us make the ante. `
`All that you have given should be returned to you in the end. `
`Come, take it!!" `
`Kinzo flung the window of his study open wide, took off the valuable golden ring that had been on his finger, `
`and threw it into the darkness of the raging wind and rain... `
`That ring was struck by lightning, and after twinkling gold for an instant, disappeared. `
`Kinzo watched it go, grinning broadly and fearlessly. `
`"I don't think I'll lose. `
`You are mine. `
`Forever!!" `
`The ring that Kinzo had thrown became a single gold butterfly and fluttered around in the wind and rain. `
`It headed for the rose garden, almost as though it was being guided there. `
`It then found the figure of the Golden Witch and fluttered down... `
`When it came down right in front of Beatrice, `
`it burst open and returned to its original form, flying through the air. `
`The way it was going, you would've expected it to fall into a puddle, but it stopped suddenly in midair. `
`...Almost as if some transparent person had caught it. `
`Apparently, even Beatrice hadn't expected this. `
`However, she realized what...no, who it was, and grinned broadly at it. `
`As she did, the shadow of the person who had caught the ring began to fuzzily appear... `
`It was the figure of a young man wearing a butler's uniform embroidered with the One-Winged Eagle crest... `
`There was no man like this among the servants of the Ushiromiya family. `
`Even so, Beatrice laughed as though it was someone she remembered fondly. `
`"Ronove, is it? `
`...It's been quite some time. `
`It seems you have remembered me. `
`You were always a man who took loyalty seriously." `
`"It has been quite some time since your last correspondence... `
`Not for a single day have I, Ronove, forgotten that I serve you, Milady. `
`I was more afraid that you had forgotten about me. `
`After all, you can be quite forgetful." `
`"*cackle*cackle*...! `
`I see, yes, I certainly am forgetful. `
`I'd forgotten even your sarcasm until I heard it again." `
`"Milady, take this." `
`With an exaggerated yet elegant gesture, he bowed respectfully... `
`and held out to Beatrice the Head's Ring that he'd just caught. `
`"It is the Ushiromiya Family Head's Ring, returned to you from Ushiromiya Kinzo. `
`It is now once again in the possession of its Master." `
`"Indeed. `
`This is Kinzo announcing the start of the game. `
`Of course I'll accept it." `
`"So, how shall we play tonight? `
`Shall I prepare the roulette immediately? `
`Or shall I prepare some black tea first?" `
`"I can't decide which, but first, I need you to greet someone. `
`I'm sure that guy's got his mouth hanging open and can't shut it. `
`Right, Battler?" `
`"Greetings. `
`Allow me to introduce myself. `
`I am called Ronove, and I serve at the side of Milady Beatrice. `
`It is truly a pleasure to meet you." `
`"See? `
`His mouth's hanging open and he can't shut it, right? `
`*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"Yeah, no shit, another incomprehensible guy just showed up!! `
`First I grumble about goat-headed people doing the Bon dance, and then goat-heads start showing up in swarms, `
`and since then, not only have those seven ass nee-sans appeared, but now there's even a butler!! `
`It doesn't make sense, cut it out!!" `
`"By the way, Battler, `
`did you notice? `
`Did you realize that meeting him is a true 'Devil's Proof'?" `
`"A-A Devil's Proof...?! `
`What do you mean...?" `
`"He may not look like it, but this guy's one of the 72, a genuine demon. `
`In other words, I've brought a demon right in front of you, which truly proves that they exist. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!! `
`Ronove holds a noble rank in hell, the 27th highest-ranked Great Demon. `
`He's a pretty useful man. `
`I summoned him at high cost and made him serve me." `
`"It is an honor to meet you. `
`While my name is amongst those of the nobles of hell, `
`I now serve as the head furniture of Beatrice-sama, who despite being a vulgar human, is a Great Witch of such caliber that demons flee before her." `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle* He's a very useful man, but he's impudent with his words. `
`Frustratingly enough, he sometimes forgets to respect his Master." `
`"Nothing in my contract specifies the manner in which I am to speak. `
`Would you like to change that contract?" `
`"It keeps me entertained, so it's fine. `
`*cackle*cackle*!" `
`Beatrice turned her back to him, cackling. `
`After bowing once to her back, Ronove turned back to Battler and stuck out his right hand, showing off an innocent smile. `
`Normally, this would mean that he was asking for a handshake. `
`"...Wh-What is this supposed to be?" `
`"I am another who has been subjected to Milady's whims. `
`In that sense, I am sure we could become good friends. `
`This is a handshake of friendship. `
`...Of course, this in no way implies your entry into a contract with a demon, so fear not." `
`"Sorry, but I'm right in the middle of a big fight with your master. `
`I only shake hands with an enemy after we've beaten each other up in a rainy schoolyard and are all worn out, like something you'd see in a teen drama. `
`Remember that." `
`"I see. `
`To shake hands with you, Battler-sama, I must create a fitting atmosphere in a suitable location, `
`exchanging sweet words and physical language with you that rings true to your heart. `
`When the opportunity arrives, I shall arrange for such an encounter." `
`"I must say, I simply lo-ve situations like that myself. `
`Pu ku ku ku...!" `
`As Ronove laughed tauntingly, he whispered to Battler, bringing his face so close that their noses were almost touching. `
`Battler, his face turning red after getting so close to another of the same sex, pushed him away. `
`"Y-You're a creepy bastard... `
`I see, just right for Beato's butler..." `
`"It is an honor to receive such words of praise. `
`I'm very confident in my tea brewing abilities, so please look forward to tea time. `
`Baking cookies is one of my hobbies, so please feel free to request any snacks you may desire." `
`"Just what I'd expect from a pair of the same gender. `
`You've started getting along well right off the bat. `
`I'm jealous." `
`"My, my. `
`I apologize for making you jealous, Milady. `
`I shall not sneakily snatch your guest away from you." `
`"Well then, I will leave for now to retake my post as head furniture and greet my subordinates. `
`Please forgive my short absence." `
`"Indeed. `
`Only the common goats and the Seven Sisters used for the ceremony have manifested themselves. `
`You will be able to finish greeting them in no time." `
`"Oh? `
`Those lively Seven Sisters are here? `
`I wonder if those naughty girls have grown a little more graceful?" `
`"...Ihihi. `
`If that's graceful, I'll have to doubt the definition of the word graceful." `
`"Is that so? `
`Then I suppose you've already had the opportunity to play with those sisters. `
`Judging by your expression, it would seem they're just as naughty as always. `
`Even though I am always telling them to act more fitting as servants of Beatrice-sama. `
`What troublesome kids..." `
`"If that's your problem, don't worry. `
`They actually act perfectly fitting for their master..." `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*! `
`Now even you have begun to say it! `
`However, a conversation means that you accept your partner. `
`The fact that you've started to respond to my idle chatting proves that you are gradually starting to accept my existence." `
`"Heh. `
`That's because, even if the sun starts rising from the west, I will definitely, absolutely never accept that you're a witch. `
`You might wanna try a more positive approach, like crying and kissing my shoes." `
`Even if Battler was bluffing, he still spoke forcefully, a fearless expression on his face. `
`The witch and her butler snickered together, realizing that their guest had regained more than enough of his willpower to attend to a new game... `
`and that preparations were complete... `
`After Ronove exchanged a few words with Beatrice, he bowed silently to Battler, scattered into several gold butterflies, and disappeared. `
`"*cackle*cackle* `
`It is truly pleasing to have such a boisterous atmosphere. `
`...How boring were the days when I was trapped alone on this island, unable to regain my power and lacking anyone to talk to..." `
`"...I get how that unpleasant guy is really fitting as your butler. `
`...But tell me. `
`Why has that butler only appeared now? `
`You said something about how only the goats and the nee-chans of the Seven Stakes had manifested themselves. `
`What did that mean...?" `
`"Indeed. `
`You still resist, but I am a fully-fledged witch. `
`I am in contact with several nonhuman entities in the spirit world." `
`"I'll bet. `
`No sane people would hang out with you. `
`First some goat monsters, then those ass nee-chans, and this time a demon butler's showed up. `
`...I hate to think about it, but the way things are going, I wouldn't be surprised if even more weird people appeared..." `
`"Hahahaha! `
`Among the furniture that work at my great golden mansion, how many demons do you think want to come over and play? `
`They will keep coming. `
`Many of them will appear." `
`"When the door to the Golden Land is opened, I will call back all of my furniture and build my new castle here on Rokkenjima. `
`Then I plan to invite all of my old friends, and we will drink and dance together for three days and three nights." `
`"...Of course, I also plan to invite Kinzo's family, you see? `
`You too, if you wish. `
`*cackle*cackle*...!" `
`"...So is this what you mean? `
`That, since you lost your power for a long time, you couldn't summon them? `
`...And then, since your magic power has been gradually increasing, `
`you've become able to summon more and more monsters?" `
`"It is as you say. `
`You stopped a hair's breadth before crumbling, `
`but your heart is already wavering, and you are unable to deny that I am a witch. `
`That wavering in your heart has been slowly restoring my power as a witch." `
`"So, are you trying to say that creepy butler appeared... `
`because I started to surrender?" `
`"That's right. `
`Bit by bit, you are surrendering to me...! `
`Isn't all that humiliation you suffered in the last game a result of you submitting to me so deeply? `
`Wasn't it great when you had to sacrifice your back for the sake of my feet? `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!" `
`"...D- `
`Dammit, `
`...I thought I'd be able to keep things as they were, as long as I didn't accept you. `
`...But it looks like that was wrong." `
`"Correct. `
`The closer you get to surrendering, the more the game will swing in my favor. `
`Isn't chess the same? `
`In the process of cornering each other's kings, we trade several pieces. `
`Of course, I still haven't cornered your king." `
`"...And furthermore, you're giving it everything you've got just to help your king escape, and have lost several pieces to me, as well as a large advantage. `
`It is only natural that further developments will tend to turn in my favor." `
`".........Damn......" `
`"From now on, you will probably be frantic as you try to avoid my checkmate. `
`...However, as you do, I will steal your pieces from you one by one. `
`In the end, you'll have lost everything but your king, and you won't be able to escape no matter how much you try. Then you will receive a true checkmate." `
`"...You were talking big last time, weren't you? `
`Something about how you'd never accept me and would torment me with eternal torture. `
`Only witches who have reached the endless level can talk about eternity. `
`That's been beyond you ever since the very beginning. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*, hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-ha!!" `
`"Kinzo-sama has already publicly displayed the location of the hidden gold within the epitaph under my portrait. `
`The rules apply equally to all who can read the epitaph. `
`If you discover the gold, I shall return everything to you." `
`"Tonight, I ask that you enjoy your battle of wits with Kinzo-sama to the fullest. `
`I sincerely pray that this night will be both intellectual and elegant. `
`--Beatrice the Golden." `
`When Maria finished reading the letter that Beatrice had handed her, everyone was at a loss for words for a while. `
`And then, they all broke the silence at once... `
`"R-Ridiculous. `
`What a worthless, vicious prank!" `
`"Seriously. `
`There is no way Father gave up the Head's Ring. `
`Beatrice? `
`Ha! `
`What a transparent prank, hoping to confuse us just by bringing up that name." `
`"Hey, hey, who filled this dessert up with a little too much punch? `
`I wanna applaud and praise you, so come clean, okay? `
`Rosa?" `
`"O-Of course not...! `
`I wouldn't pull a prank by assuming Father's name!" `
`"Then Aneki?! `
`Aniki?!" `
`"Me?! `
`Are you an idiot?! `
`It was Nii-san, right?! `
`Only he could plan something this vulgar!!" `
`"Are you trying to mock me?!! `
`I'm the one who wants to question you! `
`Who is behind this ill-natured prank?!" `
`Krauss beat the table and stared at everyone. `
`...Since that included the children too, he scared most of them... `
`"...A letter from a mysterious person who claims to have been given full rights to Father's assets. `
`Considering that the whole point of this family conference is the discussion of that subject, `
`...I think it's too hasty to call this a mere prank." `
`"We can't be sure. `
`Maybe it really is one of Father's shady pranks... `
`He might've planned this to shock us a bit, since we've been discussin' the distribution of his inheritance without him..." `
`"If Dad was the one who planned this, `
`...then we can't take what Maria-chan just read aloud as a joke, right...?" `
`"...That's right. `
`If you interpret the contents literally, ...then this is a test from Father. `
`The epitaph of the witch has been displayed in the hall for quite some time now, so that any one of us could solve it. `
`There was plenty of notice. `
`That means he was saying that the first person to solve it would be handed the inheritance along with all of his wealth, right...?" `
`...See? My magic granted your wish... `
`"Ridiculous, there is nothing of the sort!! `
`It is an unshakable fact that my husband will become the successor to the Ushiromiya family headship!!" `
`"Well, doesn't this letter shake that?! `
`This is a message from the person who was given full rights to all of Father's wealth! `
`Nii-san's right to become the Head has returned to a blank slate. `
`The person who solves the riddle... `
`the person who finds Beatrice's gold will become the next Head of the Ushiromiya family!!" `
`"Ridiculous...! `
`Do you think we can trust the meaningless words in that letter? `
`That the seal was the real thing? `
`There's no way we could trust that!!" `
`"Then let's try to go and ask Father directly! `
`At this point, you can't get away with saying he's grumpy or feeling bad, right?! `
`The sealed wax clearly shows that this was from Father's representative! `
`If you doubt that, then show some proof, Nii-san. `
`Show that this letter does not contain Father's will!!" `
`"V-Very well. `
`It is just as you say. `
`It no longer matters whether Father's in a good mood or not... `
`Let us go up and ask him directly." `
`"Let's do it. `
`We'll ask Dad directly. `
`Dad is Dad, so why would he act in such a roundabout way? `
`Then again, I guess that would be like him!" `
`"I-I wonder if we really should continue this discussion on the assumption that this letter came from Father..." `
`"Stupid Rosa!! `
`Isn't it obviously from Father?! `
`That letter is Father's!! `
`Isn't it obvious that he's giving the four of us an even chance to become the Successor?!! `
`Die, you brainless idiot!!" `
`Rosa really is dumb. `
`If only she'd just give up and die... `
`"I-I'm sorry...! `
`Th-Th-That's right, `
`I'm sorry..." `
`In the beginning, the adults had all doubted the credibility of the letter, `
`but after realizing that this was a once-in-a-lifetime chance in the inheritance struggle for the three younger siblings, Eva changed her position, claiming that the letter was authentic. `
`Rudolf and Rosa caught on and agreed. `
`"Outrageous!! `
`How can adults like you take such a worthless prank this seriously...?! `
`I don't need to be Father to understand his contempt!!" `
`"Whoa, whoa, whoa! `
`Natsuhi-san, all we've gotta do is ask Father and we're done, right...?! `
`Won't everything be fine if Father just tells us that he doesn't know about any letter?" `
`"Nii-san, `
`take responsibility and just get him to say that he doesn't know about the letter. `
`This is no time to get scared just because he's in a bad mood, okay?!" `
`He's still scared of Father at his age, that idiot. `
`If only he'd just give up and die... `
`"Y-Yeah! `
`Let's get this settled clearly. `
`He's probably eating in his study right now. `
`Let's have him set down his chopsticks for just a moment...!" `
`"It's decided. `
`Let's go! `
`Kyrie, wait here for a while. `
`We'll go to check whether it's true or not and come back quickly." `
`"...Thank you. `
`I'll wait patiently for Gohda-san to bring in dessert." `
`The four siblings, Natsuhi, and Hideyoshi all rose from their seats forcefully and flew out into the hallway with a clatter. `
`Afterwards, only the children, stunned completely speechless, Nanjo, who looked uncomfortable, `
`and Kyrie, who just shrugged, were left. `
`In the middle of all of this was Maria, who looked a little scared at the adults' sudden change. `
`...However, judging from her appearance, `
`she didn't look like she realized the full meaning of what she'd just read. `
`"...What in the world...was that all about...? `
`I don't get it..." `
`"...They're all bastards. `
`Do they really want the inheritance that much...?!" `
`"......Everyone, `
`this is our parents' problem. `
`It has nothing to do with us. `
`So you mustn't worry about it." `
`"Even if you say that, `
`...they were so blatant about it..." `
`"I can't believe them...! `
`Showing off their greed like that...!" `
`"Uu-! `
`Everyone has to believe together that we'll be happy! `
`Uu-uu-!" `
`"...That's right. `
`We all did promise. `
`Come on, Battler-kun, Jessica-chan, you too..." `
`"......Haah." `
`"...I feel horrible..." `
`We couldn't accept it at all, but we laid down our arms for the time being. `
`...We'd been vaguely aware of how filthy this family conference was going to be. `
`...However, after that six-year blank, I couldn't help being shocked... `
`When he saw that the children were completely dejected, Doctor Nanjo cleared his throat uncomfortably. `
`"...It's an adult matter. `
`It has nothing to do with all of you young people. `
`Let us forget about it." `
`"I would if I could...!" `
`"I know it's hard. `
`But forget it for now. `
`...All of your parents are fighting frantically to make your futures just a little brighter. `
`Please, don't look at your injured parents with those cold eyes when they come back." `
`"......... `
`No matter how much you ask us, Kyrie-san, `
`...that'll be tough." `
`"If we could be happy with an explanation like that, `
`...we wouldn't be kids..." `
`"Uu-! `
`Everyone, be happy-!! `
`Can't get da-rk!! `
`Belie-ve! `
`If everyone doesn't believe we can be happy, that happiness will get away! `
`Everyone has to believe! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!!" `
`"...I like the sound of that. `
`I'll believe too. `
`I'll believe we can find happiness." `
`"Uu-! `
`Aunt Kyrie, thank you!! `
`Battler and Jessica, you believe too! `
`Beatrice is also always saying that magic won't have any power if you don't believe. `
`Uu-!" `
`Kyrie-san rose from her seat quietly, went over to Maria, and crouched down so that their eyes met. `
`"...Uu-. `
`Aunt Kyrie believed. `
`Now, Battler and Jessica have to believe." `
`"Those two are strong. `
`They'll feel better soon, and then they'll believe." `
`"Yeah." `
`"More importantly, `
`......I want you to tell me something." `
`When Kyrie-san said that, Jessica, George-aniki, Doctor Nanjo and I all listened closely. `
`...It looked like our parents were so concerned with the inheritance problem that Grandfather filled their minds, `
`but we wanted to ask Maria about something simpler. `
`"Uu-? `
`What?" `
`"Who gave you that letter...?" `
`"Beatrice!!" `
`"The witch drawn in that portrait...?" `
`"Uu-! `
`She gave me this letter and an umbrella! `
`And she used magic to fix my rose that was broken! `
`Beatrice is an awesome witch who can do anything!!" `
`"......Could you tell us about that in a bit more detail...?" `
