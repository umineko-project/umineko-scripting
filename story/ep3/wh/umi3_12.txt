`Rosa returned to the lobby. `
`It was still her turn to rest, `
`but her expression made it look as though she couldn't sleep deeply with all this tension. `
`"...Take it easy and lie down. `
`Keep this up and you'll have it pretty rough later on." `
`"Thanks for the concern. `
`I just couldn't fall asleep. `
`...I've already taken a shower, so I'm good for now. `
`The next person can rest." `
`"What about you two, Kyrie-san? Rudolf-san?" `
`"...What will we do, Rudolf-san? `
`Shall we rest?" `
`"You can rest. `
`I'll stay awake. `
`That's the only manly thing I can do right now." `
`"Then I'll stay awake. `
`Staying awake with my husband is the only womanly thing I can do right now." `
`"...*giggle* `
`You two truly are close." `
`"You should talk. `
`*giggle*." `
`"It seems Eva and Hideyoshi-san are out cold. `
`It appears that, unlike Rosa, they can't fight against their age." `
`As though in response to those words, the door to the hall clunked open. `
`Eva and Hideyoshi returned from the guest room. `
`"That's none of your business. `
`...Oh, Rosa, are you sure you don't need to rest yet?" `
`"You should talk, Nee-san. `
`Why not take it easy and sleep?" `
`"......I just can't get to sleep. `
`Taking a shower shook my drowsiness off. `
`Rudolf, Kyrie-san, you can rest if you want." `
`"Sure, thanks. `
`Well, for now, let's say I appreciate the sentiment. `
`Why don't you go first, Aniki?" `
`"How kind of you. `
`But I cannot rest first. `
`That is the most I can do as the oldest brother right now." `
`"Do not worry, the two of us will stay awake until the very end." `
`"...*giggle* `
`......More importantly, Eva nee-san, `
`are you okay? `
`You look a little pale." `
`"...Come to think of it, you're right. `
`...Hmmm? `
`Could it be a bit of a fever?" `
`Hideyoshi put his hand up against Eva's forehead. `
`...It seemed that Eva wasn't feeling her best. `
`"That goes without saying. `
`...That's what happens you break your sleep cycle at your age. `
`...Is it a cold?" `
`"...Natsuhi, `
`could you call Doctor Nanjo down?" `
`"Y-Yes." `
`"...I'm fine, you don't have to make such a fuss over it. `
`I have some medicine, so I'll be okay. `
`...I tend to get fevers when I'm tired. `
`Don't worry." `
`"...Nee-san, take it easy, okay?" `
`"......Thank you. `
`...If the siblings gathered without me around, I get the feeling everyone would start talking behind my back. `
`...It's a persecution complex from long ago. `
`Sorry, okay?" `
`"......Well, I won't say anything. `
`As if I'd say bad things about you behind your back, Nee-san." `
`"............" `
`"...What is it? `
`Nee-san, you've been acting strange for a while. `
`Shouldn't you get a little rest now?" `
`"......You're right. `
`Just thinking about {i:raising money by March} makes my headache hurt even worse." `
`"That isn't good. `
`Rest. `
`...And I'll hold back too, so that your headache doesn't get worse. `
`I've had a bad headache myself for a while now." `
`"......Thank you. `
`...Well then, I'll take those words to heart and rest for a while." `
`"What is it, Eva? `
`Why so angry all of a sudden? `
`...Sorry, please let us rest a bit longer. `
`Sorry, sorry..." `
`After apologizing several times as though praying, `
`Hideyoshi followed Eva out of the lobby. `
`"......I don't like this atmosphere. `
`It's all so strained." `
`"That's no surprise. `
`...There was a murder early this morning. `
`And since then, we've been eating canned food and carrying guns around. `
`...It's natural that we'd start to build up stress." `
`"I wonder if the kids up there are building up stress too. `
`...I'm worried about Maria. `
`She tends to throw tantrums at times like this." `
`At that moment, they heard the sound of wild footsteps coming from the second floor. `
`The guesthouse wasn't a cheap building, so they wouldn't normally have heard the sound of footsteps. `
`It was like the sound of someone stamping their feet in frustration. `
`And an instant later, accompanied by what seemed to be the sound of her running out into the second floor hallway, `
`they could hear Maria calling uu-uu-uu- over and over again, sounding displeased. `
`Rosa grabbed her head, her hair flying, and she voicelessly moaned in anguish... `
`The adults conscientiously turned their backs to her, pretending not to notice. `
`The noisy clamor came down from the second floor and flew into the lobby. `
`It was Maria, who was sobbing, along with the other children and Nanjo. `
`...In other words, they had all come downstairs because of Maria's tantrum. `
`Rosa couldn't hide her dizziness at this new annoyance her daughter was bringing to everyone... `
`"S-Sorry, Aunt Rosa... `
`We tried to calm her, but she just wouldn't listen..." `
`"Uu-uu-uu-!! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!! `
`Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!" `
`"...What is it, Maria? `
`Could you be a little more quiet? `
`Everyone's watching." `
`"It's that rose of hers from the rose garden... `
`She suddenly started saying that she was worried about it." `
`"...I think she's half asleep. `
`She suddenly woke up and started going on about how worried she was about that rose. `
`......Maria-chan, calm down. `
`That was just a dream..." `
`"Uu-uu-uu-uu-!! `
`That rose belonged to Beatrice and me!! `
`So if I don't take care of it, Beatrice is gonna get mad!! `
`It might get snapped off again! `
`Uu-uu-uu-! `
`Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!" `
`"......Haah...! `
`...Listen, I'm {i:telling} you to quiet down a bit, {i:alright}?!?!" `
`The sudden rise in the tone of Rosa's voice surprised the children. `
`But Maria's crying just grew louder, and her tantrum just grew fiercer. `
`"R-Rosa-san, `
`you mustn't scold a child so unsparingly... `
`...At times like this, it's best to give them some warm milk or something." `
`"...Is there any here?" `
`"The milk we just had for breakfast is empty now..." `
`"Doesn't anyone have a sedative to use on kids...? `
`You know, those silver pill things?" `
`"Of course I do!! `
`Yes, I'll search for them now and make her take them!!" `
`Without hiding her displeasure, Rosa grabbed the handbag that had been set on the sofa and fished around for some medicine. `
`...It seemed she had brought some child-use sedatives for Maria's tantrums. `
`She found it and opened the bottle, but it must have been empty. `
`Irritated, Rosa shook the bottle several times, but that didn't change the fact that nothing was in there. `
`...As she did that, Maria's crying grew even more intense... `
`At that time, Eva was lying on her bed, covered by the bedding. `
`Hideyoshi returned from the washroom, folding a handkerchief soaked in water. `
`"...Whoo, this is one nasty fever... `
`...I'll bet it's the poisonous air at this family conference that got you... `
`...For now, you can forget all about the other relatives. `
`...Okay?" `
`As Hideyoshi spoke to her kindly, he set the soaked handkerchief on Eva's burning forehead. `
`Eva rested her own hand on top of his. `
`"......Your hand... `
`feels nice and cool." `
`"If my hand feels nice, your fever must be pretty bad. `
`Don't worry, the medicine'll start workin' soon. `
`Plus, my hand is a magic hand. `
`I just put it against your forehead like this, `
`and any fever'll melt right away." `
`"You're right. `
`...Your hand always makes my fevers fade..." `
`"Yep. `
`No need for a doctor when you've got my hand. `
`Don't worry and close your eyes. `
`...My magic'll make that fever fade away..." `
`"Yes, I know... `
`...I can feel your magic." `
`Hideyoshi was about to say it was just a placebo effect, but he stopped. `
`...If Eva said she could feel magic coming from his hand, then that was fine for now... `
`"......I wonder if magic really exists." `
`"Yeah. `
`It does. `
`Only those who believe can tell, though. `
`...There's actually a lot of magic like that out there in the world." `
`"...If magic actually exists, ...then I wonder if witches actually exist too." `
`"Oh? `
`You mean that witch of the forest, Beatrice? `
`She probably does exist for those who believe. `
`Just like the gods. `
`They don't show themselves except in front of those with strong faith." `
`"......I did it too, you know? `
`...Long ago, I was able to use magic." `
`"Oh? `
`Really? `
`Then you were a witch too." `
`"...I...had dreams that I wanted to come true no matter what. `
`After wishing strongly and trying hard, they always came true without fail. `
`...With my magic, my grades were always the best, and I even became the student council president...and worked hard to get into the university I wanted. `
`...Everything I wished for was granted." `
`"That's right. `
`Your magic was always a thing to be reckoned with... `
`You're definitely a witch. `
`...And you work harder than anyone. `
`...I know all about it." `
`"......When... `
`I was a kid, the whole time, there was another me inside myself, who always supported me. `
`...And that other self was a witch." `
`"......I didn't believe in Beatrice, the witch of the forest. `
`I always believed that if a witch of Rokkenjima did exist, it was the witch inside my heart. `
`......I was so grateful to that witch inside myself. `
`...I was always grateful...that she brought me to you..." `
`"......You get too timid when you're sick. `
`...Don't say anythin' for now. `
`...I'll stay like this the whole time, until your fever's gone down." `
`"...Yes. `
`......Don't take your hand away, `
`no matter what. `
`......Somehow, `
`...I feel like I'm becoming something that isn't myself, `
`...and I've been scared for a while now. `
`...I get the feeling that the witch inside me... `
`was provoked by Beatrice...and is growing stronger and stronger. `
`...Somehow, it feels like she's going to swallow me whole." `
`"It's okay. `
`As long as I'm with you, there's nooothin' to be afraid of! `
`Remember the time we went to that dangerous country and the whole bus got robbed? `
`I drove 'em off!" `
`"...Didn't you just hand over your gold watch and beg them to go away? `
`...It was pretty lame, ...but it was cool..." `
`"......Don't move your hand away... `
`no matter what... `
`...Not even if I fall asleep. `
`...And if something creepy sneaks in here, `
`...protect me..." `
`"Yep, leave it to me. `
`...That's why I'm tellin' you to stop worryin' and get to sleep. `
`Because the medicine and my magic'll start workin' real soon..." `
`Eva finally calmed her heart and closed her eyes. `
`...At that time, there was the sound of a door being opened violently from the direction of the lobby. `
`It seemed that Maria was having a tantrum, `
`and screams of uu-uu- could be heard, along with Rosa's rebuking yells. `
`...That probably hurt Eva's ears. `
`Or maybe it was giving her a headache. `
`Eva moaned as though in pain and buried herself in the covers. `
`It was easy to guess what was happening. `
`Maria had probably had a tantrum for some reason, gone down to the lobby, `
`and started arguing with Rosa, who then scolded her daughter. `
`...And then, maybe that got too embarrassing to be shown in front of the other relatives, so Rosa had taken Maria out into the corridor. `
`...Hideyoshi had no desire to butt in on Rosa and Maria's problem. `
`...But just for now, since Eva's condition was so bad, he wanted them to take their ruckus somewhere else. `
`"...Wait just a sec. `
`I'll ask them to keep it down." `
`"......C-Come back quickly..." `
`"Don't worry, I won't leave this room." `
`Hideyoshi removed the chain, opened the door, and stuck his face out into the corridor. `
`He immediately met Rosa's gaze. `
`"...Everythin' okay, Rosa-san?" `
`"I'm sorry, did all this noise wake you...?" `
`"Uu‐uu! `
`Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!!" `
`"...Maria-chan, sorry. `
`Aunt Eva isn't feelin' well, and she's tryin' to sleep. `
`Could you quiet down a bit...?" `
`Maria's tone didn't change after Hideyoshi's request. `
`She kept whining and repeating "My rose, my rose". `
`Rosa slapped Maria's cheek, lifted her up while covering her mouth, `
`and dragged her towards the entrance, trying to at least put some distance between her and Hideyoshi's room. `
`...She would still probably be noisy for a while, but he had warned Rosa for the time being. `
`Relying on Rosa's actions as a mother, Hideyoshi closed the door. `
`"......Is Maria-chan having a tantrum again?" `
`"Looks like it. `
`...It's tough for Rosa-san too. `
`...Come to think of it, our George is almost too good to be true. `
`We should be grateful." `
`"......You're right. `
`......Nng, `
`...hand." `
`"Oh, sorry, sorry. `
`...Look, it's the magic hand." `
`He put his hand on Eva's forehead again. `
`...Maybe there really was magical power in that hand. `
`A truly peaceful look rose to Eva's face, and bit by bit, she began to drift off into the land of sleep. `
`As he had promised, Hideyoshi kept his hand on her forehead... `
`By the entrance, with her hand still against Maria's mouth, Rosa was at a loss at what to do next. `
`She hadn't been able to withstand everyone's gazes in the lobby, `
`and had yelled at the children to go upstairs, dashing out of the lobby. `
`Then, she had gone out into the corridor, only to have Hideyoshi say that she was too noisy. `
`Where should I go now? `
`...Where should I take this child who's having a tantrum? `
`She felt as though tears of frustration were about to come out... `
`As Maria kept struggling in an attempt to scream, Rosa put her mouth up to Maria's ear... `
`and tried to persuade Maria in a properly calm voice. `
`"......Maria, do you really want to see the rose that much...?" `
`Maria nodded her head several times, moaning uu-uu-. `
`"...Why do you want to see it so much? `
`I'll listen as your mother, so will you tell me quietly? `
`I'll hit you if you scream." `
`"......My rose... `
`Beatrice revived it. `
`...It might have snapped off again... `
`...I'm worried about that... `
`I can't sleep until I'm sure..." `
`Apparently, she was still upset about that marked rose from yesterday. `
`Rosa felt her headache throbbing again, `
`but she was at least a little relieved that Maria had now stopped her screaming. `
`"Anyway, everyone is having a hard time right now. `
`So don't bother Mama and everyone else. `
`...You can worry about that rose all you want tomorrow, when it stops raining. `
`So for now, listen to me...!" `
`"No. `
`...No no no no. `
`It's my Beatrice's rose... `
`...uuuu, ...uu-uu-. `
`Waaaaaaaaaaahh!!" `
`Rosa reflexively covered Maria's mouth. `
`She had spoken a little too harshly and gotten her agitated again... `
`Rosa realized that it was partly her own fault and clicked her tongue in self-hatred. `
`But Maria thought that was directed at her, and her crying grew even fiercer... `
`"...Please, just be quiet... `
`What can I do to make you stop crying? `
`What should I do to make you listen to what your Mama says?" `
`"......" `
`Suddenly. `
`Maria stopped crying so fast that it seemed unnatural. `
`...Then she turned around...and muttered. `
`"...... `
`If I get to see my rose, I'll stay quiet until tomorrow." `
`"Really?" `
`"Yes. `
`...If we go to the rose garden and see my rose, I'll calm down." `
`"........." `
`"I mean it, Mama." `
`"............" `
`If it would keep Maria quiet for the time being, `
`Rosa thought that even going out into this wind and rain would be a small price to pay. `
`She thought it might be a bit reckless. `
`......But in the end, no murder or anything of the sort had actually occurred. `
`All of that clamor since this morning had been a farce set up by Kinzo. `
`If you carefully thought about that chain of closed rooms, it clearly had to all be an act... `
`"...Will you really listen if you get to see the rose?" `
`"Yes. `
`I mean it, Mama. `
`...Kihihi." `
`"............" `
`"Ouch." `
`Rosa didn't overlook that creepy laugh, and lightly hit Maria with her fist. `
`And she shrugged, as though giving up. `
`"...Understood. `
`If it's just one look, then I'll agree. `
`Will that work?" `
`"Yes, Mama. `
`I promise. `
`...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi." `
`Once again, Rosa tested the weight of her gun. `
`...It'll be okay. `
`It's only an act. `
`There was never a murderer on this island in the first place... `
`"Damn it, wait, Aunt Rosa...!! `
`Are Aunt Rosa and Maria...the sacrifices for the second twilight?! `
`Damn it, damn it, damn it, someone, notice them, tell them to stop!! `
`What are those guys in the living room and us kids doing?!!" `
`"Indeed. `
`They are being considerate of Rosa's pitiful relationship with her daughter...and are forcibly changing the subject. `
`The group that includes you went up to the second floor...and is talking about something else while watching TV." `
`"You bastards!! `
`Someone, notice them! `
`Who's the closest, is it Uncle Hideyoshi?! `
`Please, notice that those two are leaving through the front door, aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!" `
`"It won't reach, it won't reach, *cackle*! `
`Don't disturb their precious time together. `
`Fuhahahahahahaha...!" `
`Hideyoshi kept talking kindly, his hand on Eva's forehead. `
`He didn't notice at all that Rosa and Maria were going outside through the front door. `
`In that case, there was no way the others in the lobby, which was even further away, would notice. `
`Much less those in the cousins' room on the second floor...! `
`"Why are you so panicked? `
`Didn't you defeat me with that bold move, saying that the culprit died in an accident on the first twilight?" `
`"...Doesn't that mean there's no longer a culprit on this island...? `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle* What is there to be so worried about...?" `
`"Shut up, I can see right through you!! `
`Someone stop them, those two'll be killed!! `
`Someone, stop theeeeeeeeeeeeeeem, aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!" `
`...There was no way that Battler's voiceless scream would reach Rosa or Maria. `
`The two of them could be seen in the rose garden. `
`The rain was still awful, but fortunately, the wind had died down a little. `
`...No, maybe that wasn't fortunate. `
`Because maybe, if the wind had been a little fiercer, Rosa might have hesitated to go outside... `
`"...Uu-, uu-, uu-... `
`......Here it is...!" `
`Maria found her rose with the gold lace and stared at it lovingly. `
`Rosa had accepted the promise under the condition that Maria would only get one look at it, `
`but she didn't want Maria to complain that it hadn't been enough later on, `
`so she decided to go along with Maria until she was satisfied. `
`...She believed that there wasn't a culprit, `
`but on the off chance that she was mistaken, they were now in an extremely dangerous position. `
`Rosa realized that faintly herself. `
`If things got bad, she would throw away her umbrella and ready her gun. `
`...After glancing at Maria's innocent happiness, Rosa gazed warily in all directions. `
`..................? `
`...Were her eyes just tired? `
`Even though no one should have been there, she thought she saw something glitter in the dark rose garden. `
`...Gold-colored...? `
`It had to be her imagination. `
`Because, to Rosa, it seemed as though gold butterflies were dancing through the rose bushes... `
`"...Are you okay, Eva...? `
`...Just take it easy... Should I call Doctor Nanjo after all...?!" `
`"I......I'm fine. `
`...Don't take your hand away... `
`...I'm begging you, ...don't take your hand away..." `
`Eva was breathing wildly. `
`Beads of sweat were appearing on her forehead. `
`It certainly was true that she had stayed up all night last night, and that things had been rough since early this morning. `
`It wasn't odd that her body wasn't keeping up. `
`...Even though he understood that, `
`Hideyoshi suspected that this sudden fever was the sign of some serious illness. `
`Several times, Hideyoshi decided to call for Doctor Nanjo, but Eva resisted firmly, `
`...pleading with him and saying that it was even more important that he didn't take his hand away... `
`"I understand... `
`But you've gotta have Doctor Nanjo look at you by lunchtime. `
`If you can promise me that, I'll stay here the whole time, grippin' your hand. `
`Tightly, like this." `
`"...Thank you... `
`...I'm fine... `
`The magic of your hand will definitely take this fever away..." `
`Even as she said that, Eva's harsh breathing didn't improve in the slightest. `
`"......Haah, `
`...haah, `
`...haahh... `
`...Don't let go, `
`...don't let go, `
`...haah, `
`...haahh, `
`......aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!" `
`"...Wh-Who is it...?!" `
`She saw an umbrella moving from beyond the rose bush. `
`Rosa threw away her umbrella and wildly lifted her gun... `
`When she did, the shadow of a person beyond the bush...showed itself. `
`"......Uu-? `
`...Aunt Eva...... `
`......?" `
`"...You scared me. `
`It's you, Nee-san? `
`......Do you have some business with me? `
`...Do you want to continue our earlier discussion?" `
`"............ `
`...Yes, that's right. `
`Our discussion about Father's gold." `
`"...Please, restrain yourself in front of Maria. `
`I will keep my promise, okay? `
`I won't get in the way of your conspiracy." `
`"......Conspiracy? `
`What's that?" `
`"......Whatever you're thinking, that's up to you. `
`I have no desire to get in the way. `
`So please, not in front of Maria. `
`As long as I get my share, that will be enough." `
`"Your share? `
`Heheheheh, ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha." `
`Eva started laughing in a creepy voice... `
`Rosa was startled, but Maria stared blankly. `
`......Then Maria said just one thing. `
`"...Uu-...? `
`...Auntie, `
`...who are you...?" `
`"Hahahahahaha, ahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`Your share?! `
`Who would give that to you...?! `
`All of that is mine! `
`It all belongs to me, the Golden Witch, Beatrice...!!!" `
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...!" `
`"Eva! Are you okay, Eva?! `
`Eva! `
`Eva!!" `
`"Hold on...!! `
`Don't let go!! `
`Don't let me be dragged away by someone who isn't me...!! `
`Hold onto my hand... `
`Don't let goooooooooooooo...!!!" `
`"When did you ever work hard?! `
`You never worked hard for anything! `
`You were always hiding in our shadows! `
`You always escaped from shadow to shadow without fighting, `
`and yet, you really think yourself qualified to make demands of me over the Ushiromiya family gold...?!" `
`"All of that is mine! `
`It's all mine alone, as the Head of the Ushiromiya family and the new Golden Witch, successor to the name of Beatrice!!" `
`"......Beatrice. `
`......It's Beatrice!! `
`Mama, Beatrice!" `
`Maria jumped at her mother in ecstasy. `
`...Rosa treated Maria coldheartedly and raised her gun high. `
`"...Hey, you're Nee-san, right...? `
`...You are Nee-san, aren't you...?" `
`"Wrong. `
`...I am no longer the one who was your sister." `
`"Then who are you?!! `
`Are you trying to say that you're Beatrice?! `
`That's impossible! `
`You died 19 years ago!!! `
`"Yes, you were definitely dead, after all, I clearly saw how your head was split open. `
`I can remember the insides flowing out like it was yesterday! `
`How can you be alive and here right noooooooooow?!?!" `
`"The concept of death does not exist to a Golden Witch. `
`The Golden Witch and the name of Beatrice will be handed down for all eternity." `
`"Maybe the Beatrice you knew met with death, but that name is mine now...! `
`And therefore, it's eternal! `
`The concept of death does not exist for Beatrice!!" `
`"......All I can see is that the gold has driven you mad. `
`...How pitiful, Nee-san...!" `
`"Come on, you know I'm not your sister anymore. `
`...Well then, as the new Beatrice, I have been tasked with my own resurrection ceremony." `
`"......Ronove! `
`What should I do?!" `
`"That is up to you. `
`You already have the power to make whatever you think reality. `
`You should grow used to it once you've tried it out a little." `
`"...You worthless former sister. `
`You should consider it an honor to have been selected as the first sacrifice I offer as a witch. `
`On the second twilight, I'll tear the two who are close apart with my own hands...!!" `
`The first thing the new Beatrice wished for... `
`no, the first magic she tried to use, was to surpass the limitations given to humans. `
`...In particular, gravity. `
`She wanted to become fully aware of her transformation into a witch by being released from those shackles. `
`As the witch and Rosa stayed as they were... `
`...The ground retreated all by itself...into the distance below them. `
`By now, their feet were no longer attached to the ground. `
`Rosa finally realized that the earth wasn't retreating into the distance below them, `
`but that she and the witch were being sucked up into the rainy sky. `
`"......Huh...? `
`.........Eeeek...?!" `
`"Wh-Whoooooooooaaaa... Awesome...!" `
`For a human shackled to the ground by gravity, there is nothing more unnerving that having their feet stop sticking to the ground. `
`...However, to Beatrice, who, in becoming the new witch, had learned the joy of being released from gravity, `
`it was enough to make her whole body shake with delight. `
`"...Hey, Rosa. `
`Do you remember, long ago, when we were small, when we used to talk about what it'd be like to become witches and fly around the sky? `
`...That dream has been granted, hasn't it? `
`I became a real witch and granted it for you." `
`"...S-Stop it, ......if this is a dream, then wake me up..." `
`"You said it yourself. `
`You said you flew through the sky in your dream. `
`And you also said you didn't want to wake up. `
`You even got mad at me when I woke you up, right? `
`...Don't worry. `
`This time, you won't wake up, okay? `
`Heheheheheheheheheheheheh!!" `
`Come, dance with me in the vast, rainy sky. `
`Didn't we both wish we could fly like seagulls in the sky... `
`and escape the cramped and boring island of Rokkenjima...? `
`Now, I'll make that dream a reality for you. `
`I only want to share this joy with you, and no one else...! `
`"Ahhahaha, ahhahahahaha!! `
`It's so fun, Rosa, it's so fun!! `
`" `
`Take a look below you! `
`Look at how small our mansion is. `
`I wonder how much time we spent in a place that small. `
`...Now I'm especially shocked at how cramped and tiny it is." `
`"So feel. `
`Enjoy. `
`Rejoice...! `
`That power we yearned for, the power to move through the sky at will! `
`Come on, let's dance, Rosa! `
`Through the rain, through the wind! `
`Let's fly around like we're dancing! `
`The lightning will shine on us and bless us!! `
`Ahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!" `
`The witch and Rosa were like leaves fluttering around in a whirlwind. `
`As the rain pounded upon every part of their bodies, as the lightning occasionally shone upon them, they shook with the joy of being released from the ground. `
`...However, it was only that way for the witch. `
`Rosa was holding onto her head, voicelessly screaming over and over. `
`"Stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiitt!! `
`Forgive meeeeee, let me doooooooown!!" `
`"...You're right, it's more fitting for Humans to crawl on the ground. `
`Then why not go back there?" `
`A slightly displeased expression rose to the witch's face when she realized that her own joy was not being shared. `
`Then, she decided to listen to her former sister's request. `
`"......?! `
`......Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!" `
`The whirlwind that had been making Rosa dance around grew weaker, then stopped. `
`In other words, Rosa was once again bound by the restrictions of gravity, as a Human. `
`...Following the laws that were originally correct, Rosa began to descend towards the ground upside-down. `
`No, she began to fall. `
`"Oops... `
`That's right, if I don't take her down the right way, this is what happens!" `
`The witch hadn't intended to send Rosa plummeting. `
`But she still wasn't used to using magic. `
`After plummeting about 100 meters into a rose bush, `
`as a very, very natural result, Rosa died instantly. `
`But the witch hadn't intended to kill her. `
`So she wished that Rosa hadn't died. `
`When she did, gold butterflies coiled about Rosa's body, reviving that life just as the witch had wished. `
`Rosa's body, which should have been spread out like a carpet of fresh blood, rapidly returned to normal. `
`The broken and crushed bones returned to normal. `
`The torn and smashed flesh returned to normal. `
`...How easy it is to break things in this world, and how difficult it is to fix them... `
`Anyone can take a life. `
`But no Human can revive a lost life! `
`By surpassing the irreversable, one proves that they have surpassed Humanity. `
`...This surely gave her a much, much greater realization of her position as a witch than flying through the sky had. `
`"......Awesome... `
`I can even revive...an ended life...!" `
`"Of course. `
`Beatrice-sama is the Endless Witch. `
`...To live and to die. `
`To bring to life and to kill, all of it repeated endlessly. `
`Beatrice-sama, the Endless Witch, is the queen who controls the cycle of life and death." `
`"Ahaha, aha. `
`One time, I knocked over a fishbowl. `
`The fragile and beautiful bowl broke, and I couldn't put it back together again. `
`I'd never see that cute pop-eyed goldfish swim again after it landed on the floor." `
`"......No matter how much I cried, the servants shook their heads, saying that broken things and dead things could never be revived." `
`"...That's when I learned something. `
`You must not break things, you must not kill people. `
`After all, you can't fix them!!" `
`"So, if you can fix them, `
`...then you won't get in trouble for breaking them, right...? `
`Haha, ahahahaha, ......awesome... `
`Awesome, awesome, awesome...!! `
`Ahhahahahahahahaahahahahahahaahhahahhahhahhahhaha!!" `
`For a while, the witch became intoxicated with how terrible and wonderful the power she had inherited was. `
`Her laugh was pure, innocent, and cruel. `
`"......Uuuuuu...au..." `
`Even though Rosa had been revived, she let out a cry of anguish at the pain from her fall. `
`At that point, the witch landed and held out her hand. `
`"Hahahahahahaha, sorry about that, Rosa. `
`I didn't think flying in the sky would be so much fun. `
`Sorry, I'm real sorry." `
`"And I didn't know Humans could die so easily. `
`But I've brought you back to life, so we're even. `
`So get up, okay? `
`Play with me some more, okay? `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle* Hehehehaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!" `
`What were those dreams you told me about when you were a kid...? `
`Go ahead and tell me all of them without holding back. `
`As I am now, I can make anything come true, no matter how absurd...! `
`Even drowning you in a sea of jelly! `
`Even having you get sucked into a mountain of cake! `
`I can even even make you sprout butterfly wings and flit around the garden, okay?! `
`I'll do them one after another. Let's start with the ocean of jelly, all right...?! `
`"S-Stop it, `
`......urgg!!" `
`Rosa was once again thrown high into the rainy sky. `
`However, the sky wasn't filled with raindrops, but with drops of orange juice. `
`When she looked down, Rosa had to doubt her eyes. `
`The rose garden had disappeared, and the ground spread out beneath her was like a pastel-colored jigsaw puzzle. `
`...It was an ocean of jelly, like the one she had spoken of from her dreams when she was young. `
`The black part was coffee jelly. `
`The red was strawberry, `
`the yellow was pineapple, `
`and the green was melon. `
`What was the white part, apple...? `
`......Did Rosa even have the time to think stuff like that? `
`Rosa fell towards that multi-colored ocean... `
`...And she sunk deep into a purple grape-flavored sea. `
`It really was an ocean of jelly. `
`It had no bottom. `
`As Rosa sank, she was shocked to see a school of transparent fish swimming through the grape jelly ocean. `
`They were probably made of grape skin. `
`Then she sunk on and on, deeper and deeper, as deep as the Marianas Trench, `
`...crushed by the water pressure of the jelly ocean... `
`as her ribs snapped, as her spine snapped. `
`...In the end, she became a small, frail meatball. `
`"Ahhahahahahahahahaha! `
`What a truly wonderful experience, to drown in an ocean of jelly...!! `
`It's a dream no one else can imitate!! `
`I made it come true for you, ahhyahyahyahya!!" `
`The instant I snapped my fingers, the meatball that had been Rosa was launched up into the sky. `
`And after being wrapped up in a golden sparkle, she returned to her original form. `
`It was as simple and easy as returning dried seaweed to its original form, and anyone could do it. `
`If they were a witch! `
`That absent-minded look on Rosa's face `
`has to be the joy from having that dream she gave up on as a child come true. `
`Definitely. Probably. `
`Next is the mountain of cake. `
`In an instant, the sky was covered...and became black and white in the shape of a chessboard. `
`That almost transparent white part was her favorite rare cheesecake. `
`The elegant black part was a slightly bitter Gateau au chocolat. `
`That became the ceiling, became a mountain, ...and several billion cakes were thrown down towards Rosa. `
`If you piled those cakes up, they would surely be taller than Mount Everest. `
`So they probably weighed... `
`...I'm not too sure, but I'll bet it was heavier than all the cakes across Japan put together. `
`It fell down like a ceiling and swallowed Rosa up, `
`...so as a very, very natural result, Rosa was crushed to death. `
`In less than a second, `
`her bones broke throughout her body and her insides were all smashed and forced out, `
`*squish*pop*slop*. `
`Even so, an even greater number of cakes piled up on top, `
`...and Rosa ended up as a layer of jam wedged between them. `
`She became as thin as a single hair...and was probably spread out over the area of a tennis court. `
`That world swallowed up by cake was once again absorbed by a gold flash. `
`Then, as though it had all been a dream, Rosa was revived once again. `
`...Of course, it definitely wasn't a dream. `
`She had been revived after dying. `
`By that point, death, which most Humans only have to experience once after they are born, `
`had already been experienced repeatedly by Rosa. `
`In other words, she gone through that which Humans cannot, the precious experience of dying more than once. `
`"Ahhahahahahahahaha, kyahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`Isn't this fun, Rosa, isn't this fun?! `
`Next is the butterflies, look...!!" `
`"P-Please, have mercy, ......aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!" `
`"No wa-y! `
`Let's play more, let's play more...!! `
`Kyahihihihahahahahahahahahaha!!" `
`Laughing innocently, she pointed her gold staff at Rosa as she begged for mercy. `
`When she did, Rosa glittered gold and rapidly began to shrink. `
`She shrank down to the size of a real butterfly. `
`Then, gold wings sprouted from her back, ...and she joined her fellow gold butterflies. `
`However, while a human body could withstand that wind, it was a different matter for a butterfly's body. `
`The gold butterfly Rosa...was invited to dance by each gale of wind, and she spun in circles around the rose garden. `
`"No, ...nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!! `
`......Ah...!" `
`As her dance wore her out, she was caught by a gentle bed. `
`It was a soft, knit hammock in the shadows beneath the roof of the arbor. `
`...The owner of that hammock lumbered into view, welcoming its rare guest who had wandered in on the night of a storm... `
`That owner, which should have been small enough to crush in the palm of your hand, `
`now looked as big as the top of a canopy bed to Rosa. `
`"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!" `
`"Kyahhahahakyahhahahahahaha! `
`What a klutz, you got caught in a spider's web! `
`Ahhahaha, ahhahahahahaha!!" `
`"This time, it's a dance with a spider. `
`That takes me back. Remember the times we'd find a spider's web and play around by throwing pebbles at it? `
`I've heard that spiders don't chew their prey, `
`but insert their venom, and when the insides melt into a sticky soup, they suck them out." `
`"...Hey, Rosa, remember? `
`Remember how we'd throw butterflies into the spider's web on purpose, and play around by seeing how the spider would attack?" `
`"Kyahhahahahahahaha, `
`I guess you don't remember, do you? This happened before you got into grade school...!! `
`Make sure you watch closely this time, okay? `
`Very closely. `
`Kyahihihahahahahahakya-hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!" `
`"Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, `
`have mercy, Nee-san, `
`help me, Nee-san!! `
`" `
`Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekk `
`gaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh `
`errrrrrrrrkkk `
`bwaagh `
`ahggggg `
`ergorblahgehmolgeeaaarg ga, `
`ga... `
`ga... `
`gyuuboh!!" `
`"This girl's not bad. She truly can use magic at will! `
`Hiihyahhahahahahakkuhihiehiehyahyahya!! `
`Amusing, amusing, how truly amusing! `
`You feel like laughing too, right, Battleeeeeeer?!" `
`"Don't fuck with me!!! `
`Stop it alreadyyyyyyyyyy!! `
`What's so fun, you're insane, you're insane!!! `
`What's so fun about doing something like this?!?!" `
`"Doesn't she look like she's having a blast? `
`What do you expect, magic is fun!! `
`I remember, when I first became able to use magic, I played around a lot! `
`...Aaah, I understand, I understand, I understand that kind of game from the bottom of my heart!" `
`"...Looks like I won't be able to share this joy and passion with you, Battler. Aah, what a shame, what a shame!! `
`If you accept me, I'll teach you magic anytime you want, see?! `
`It's hard to describe the joy you receive in the instant you're freed from the shackles of Humanity!" `
`"I want to teach you about it, that joy, that passion! `
`I'd deeefinitely like to see the world of magic you'd give birth to, just once! `
`Kihhihihihhihhi, hyahhyahhahahahahahahahahaha!!" `
`"Isn't this starting to get fun? `
`You've started wanting to use magic, haven't you?! `
`It's pretty fun to be a witch, isn't it?! `
`Just for you, I'll teach everything! `
`About the joy of flying together in the sky, about the joy of diving together through the sea!" `
`"I want to show you the passion that starts the instant you surpass the bounds of Humans `
`and see how wide your world stretches! `
`Wouldn't that be fun, `
`wahhyahhyahahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!" `
`There was no malice in Beato's expression. `
`...It was hard to believe, but she was genuinely enjoying this cruel show. `
`And she wanted to share that appreciation with Battler. `
`...Battler was shocked by that hopelessly `
`different sense of values. `
`"You're insane!! `
`Stop it already, damn iiiiiiiiit!! `
`Virgilia, make them stop this insane farce!! `
`What should I do?!!" `
`"......We exist outside the board. `
`We cannot touch the board itself." `
`Virgilia shook her head apologetically. `
`...Her body had already been 'killed'. `
`Did that mean she couldn't interfere in any way...? `
`As Beatrice continued to look amused in an insane sort of way, Battler lifted her up by the collar and yelled at her. `
`"Stop it stop it stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!! `
`Quit messing around, witch!! `
`Are you trying to tell me that's Aunt Eva?! `
`That's impossible!! `
`The Aunt Eva I know might be a bit mean at times, `
`but it's completely impossible that she's the kind of person who'd do something this cruel!!" `
`"This is all part of your deception!! `
`Don't toy with Aunt Rosa!! `
`Don't toy with Aunt Eva!! `
`Stop this farce right nooooooooooooooooow!!" `
`"I told you, I'm not the one playing with Rosa anymore. `
`Like I said, that's the new Beatrice." `
`"Is it really so terrible that you have to squeal like that? `
`You're also pretty fond of stuff like this, aren't you?! `
`You actually have just a bit of interest in magic and `
`...ouch. `
`Wh-What are you doing...?" `
`For the first time, Battler slapped Beato's cheek. `
`...Beatrice didn't know why he had done something like that to her, and a surprised expression rose to her face. `
`Battler especially couldn't forgive that expression, and he roared. `
`"Aaaaaaaaaaahh?! `
`You call this amusing?! `
`What's wrong with your head?!! `
`Die! `
`Go slice your head to bits and look inside, you'll see there's nothing there!!! `
`Stop it right now, stop this disgusting farce!! `
`I won't forgive you!! `
`How could you do something so cruel?!! `
`I've sometimes thought you could be a bit funny, but I'll never make that mistake again! `
`You're just a monster who's cruel on all levels!!! `
`Don't show yourself in front of me!! `
`Never again!! `
`I won't accept you, I won't talk with you, I don't even want to look at your face!! `
`Did you hear me?!! `
`Don't show yourself in front of me, `
`DISAPPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAARRR!!!" `
`The instant Battler screamed, the power that resisted the witch became a red wall and knocked Beato back onto her butt. `
`"...Owowowow... `
`...What are you talking about, isn't it an interesting show...?" `
`She spoke defensively, but the target of those words, Battler, was no longer there. `
`His figure had suddenly disappeared into the darkness... `
`...But Beatrice looked displeased and continued trying to explain herself. `
`"...I-It's not as though I'm completely blind to where you're coming from, `
`...but this is nothing more than an innocent prank, isn't it...? `
`No matter how you kill them, they'll always be brought back to life in the end, right? `
`...I thought Humans were creatures who say all's well that ends well...?!" `
`"H-Hey, Teacher, `
`there was no reason for him to get so angry, right...?!" `
`She was hoping for approval, but Virgilia simply faced her with an indifferent expression. `
`...To Beato at that moment, even an exasperated look would probably have been better. `
`"......I have nothing in particular to say. `
`If you think this is fun, you can keep watching as long as you want. `
`...Call me when it's over. `
`I will vanish until then." `
`Following Battler's lead, Virgilia vanished into the darkness... `
`Beato, who was now completely isolated and didn't have a clue what was going on, felt that they were making her out to be the bad guy. `
`"............ `
`...What's wrooong? `
`Isn't it an amusing show...?! `
`I-It might be a little vulgar, ...but it's quite interesting, isn't it...?!! `
`Hey, Ronove...?! `
`It's nothing to get so mad about, right...?! `
`"Pu ku ku ku. `
`...Something interesting for you, Milady, may not necessarily be interesting for Battler-sama." `
`"Does he really...hate me that much? `
`...Well, certainly, we are enemies and opponents in this competition, `
`...but is our relationship really so bad that we can't laugh together at this display...?! `
`......Since I applauded together with Battler, I thought I could at least laugh together with him... `
`...Does he really reject me so much that we can't even do that...?" `
`"...He doesn't have to accept that I'm a witch. `
`We're challenging each other in this game, after all. `
`And yet, he won't look at my face, he won't talk to me, `
`...and he'll probably do all he can to ignore me... `
`Am I really hated that muuuuuch...?!" `
`"The moves you've made up to this point have been more than enough to earn his hatred. `
`Even a demon such as myself can understand a bit of Battler-sama's feelings." `
`"...Perhaps you cannot understand because you are especially thickheaded, Milady. `
`Pukukukukuku." `
`"Sh-Shut up shut up shut up shut up!! `
`Why don't you disappear too?!!" `
`"Yes, certainly. `
`...Then, if you would excuse me." `
`Even Ronove hid himself in the darkness, and Beatrice was left alone. `
`The only one in the rainy rose garden. `
`No one ever plays with a lonely witch. `
`And the fact that no one ever does is what makes them a lonely witch. `
`"...... `
`...What's going on? `
`...Why won't anyone play with me...? `
`......Am I really that weird, that cruel...? `
`......Someone, answer meeeeeeeeee!!" `
`"Kyahhahahahahahaha, isn't this fun, Rosa, isn't this fun?! `
`Hey, how should we play next? `
`Of course, we should play with Maria too, right? `
`Let's all have a friendly walk together, okay? `
`Let's swim in a pot of boiling chocolate, let's have a picnic in a cake-rising oven! `
`Ahahaha, *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!" `
`"......H-Hey, new Beatrice." `
`Behind the witch that was continuing her mad banquet, Beato showed herself. `
`...That expression was very rare for her. `
`It was somehow restrained, unreliable, miserable. `
`"Oh, it's the Predecessor Beatrice-sama. `
`Were you watching? `
`The power of magic is truly wonderful! `
`Until now, I never thought it'd be so fun to be reborn as a witch. `
`It's like playtime that never ends...! `
`Come on, let's play together, Predecessor-sama...!!" `
`"But first, wait for a second, okay?! `
`I cooked the two of them to death in an oven, so I have to revive them again! `
`They're like bread rising from yeast! `
`Like cookies expanding in an oven! `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!" `
`"L-Listen to what I'm saying... `
`...Umm, well, `
`isn't that enough for the sacrifice of the second twilight? `
`...Of course, there are no rules regarding how you kill them, but, `
`umm, `
`...maybe you shouldn't toy with them any more than that..." `
`"What are you saying, Predecessor-sama? `
`I heard from Ronove a short while ago. `
`Wasn't your magic much, much more wonderful, cruel, and crazy?!" `
`"That Halloween party where candies poured out of six people's stomachs was truly wonderful! `
`So maybe I'll act out Alice's tea party...! `
`I'll invite everyone to a tea party in celebration of a completely pointless day, and entertain them one by one with my magic!" `
`"I wonder if I can do it as wonderfully as you? `
`I wonder if I can be cruel in my own pop, cute style?! `
`Now that I think about it, all fairy tales are cruel, aren't they? `
`Now that I'm a witch inside one of those fairy tales, I finally understand. `
`Kyahhahahahakukyahyafuhyahahahahaha!!" `
`"......I have also, umm, `
`...sometimes thought that, in the past, `
`...I might have gone a little too far. `
`...Well, I think that as the Golden Witch, it's probably best to show a little elegance..." `
`"......??? `
`I don't get what you're saying, Predecessor-sama. `
`But there's one thing I do understand. `
`No matter how hard I try now, I'm no match for how cruel you are. `
`I've gotta try much, much harder. `
`I've gotta become more cruel, and become an excellent Golden Witch...!" `
`"L-Like I said, you've already done enough here...! `
`A-Anyway, this is an order from me as your predecessor. `
`That's enough for the second twilight. `
`I'll show you how it's done. `
`Stand back and watch..." `
`"Yes, Predecessor-sama. `
`I can't wait to see what brutal, cruel, and disgusting method of killing you use." `
`The new witch grasped the sides of her skirt and gave a graceful bow, `
`stepping back as an expectant gaze rose to her face. `
`...She was expecting an even more cruel magic that surpassed even herself. `
`"......Well, speaking of that... `
`You're only half a witch if you can only kill with methods like that. `
`...I shall show you an elegant way to kill, worthy of the Golden Witch..." `
`When Beato waved her pipe, seven colors of smoke poured out, reviving Rosa and Maria. `
`...Compared to how the new Beatrice had done it a short while ago, it was slightly gentler. `
`...It was probably gentler than how Beato had done it herself up until now. `
`Rosa's consciousness had already grown dim from the pain of so many repeated deaths. `
`...But even so, she pleaded that her daughter be spared... `
`"...Please...have mercy... `
`...Even...if it's just Maria, ...have mercy..." `
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, Mama, Mamaaaaaa!!" `
`"......Sorry. `
`My disciple just...umm...acted without restraint for a bit. `
`...Umm, `
`......forgive me." `
`'B-Beatriceeeeeeeeeeeeee! `
`Waaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaahh, waaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaahh!!" `
`When Maria realized it was the real Beatrice, she jumped onto her. `
`"...You promised, right, Beato?! `
`You promised you'd take me to the Golden Land, right?! `
`There, I'll be friendly with Mama, and everyone will laugh together...! `
`You promised you'd take me there, right?!" `
`".........A‐ `
`About that. `
`...I can no longer... `
`keep that promise. `
`......Because someone appeared who could solve the riddle, `
`...I am no longer the Golden Witch, Beatrice. `
`...So, sorry. `
`...I can no longer keep my promise with you..." `
`"Why...? `
`Why...? `
`You promised..." `
`"...I'm sorry. `
`...I'm truly sorry... `
`......So at least...in apology for not being able to keep my promise..." `
`......I'll give you a quiet... `
`sleep that will never be disturbed again... `
`Beato embraced Maria with a loving expression on her face... `
`Then, ......softly, a red bruise appeared on Maria's neck. `
`It was a very gentle bruise. `
`...Its redness grew bit by bit, ...and when it distinctly formed itself into the shape of a hand... `
`...Maria's neck tilted suddenly. `
`...Peacefully, as though she had fallen asleep. `
`"M-Maria... `
`...Mariaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!" `
`"...Sorry. `
`...I won't apologize that you were the sacrifices for the second twilight. `
`That is simply your fate. `
`However, I must apologize for the vulgar way in which you were offered as sacrifices... `
`...This is your final sleep. `
`...Never again will it be disturbed..." `
`Beato softly, gently lifted her finger, as though touching the empty air in front of her nose. `
`...When she did, a light breeze lifted up, making Rosa's body dance lightly like a feather. `
`Then, Rosa's body floated softly... `
`...and right there was the garden fence, with its spear-shaped prongs. `
`The spear of the fence pierced Rosa's medulla oblongata. `
`...Benevolently, without toying with her, in a single blow. `
`Rosa's life was snapped out. `
`Compared to the earlier innocent yet cruel events, it seemed to be over much too fast. `
`...It just looked like a doll shaped like Rosa was leaning against the fence. `
`...But, she had passed away. `
`"......W-Well, something like that should do the trick." `
`Beato acted proud, but the new witch wore a blank expression, almost as though this was an anticlimax. `
`Then, she said it out loud. `
`"It's kinda plain... `
`...Not at all like the Predecessor-sama Ronove told me about." `
`"...Well, ...you must use magic with dignity, right...? `
`If it's too...umm...undignified, that isn't very elegant..." `
`"............ `
`...Even though you're lucky enough to have the magic to do wonderful things endlessly... `
`...How boring." `
`"Hey, don't complain...! `
`The path of the Golden Witch cannot be completed in a day. `
`You are still incomplete until you finish the tenth twilight... `
`For now, stay quiet and follow my instructions. `
`...Got it...?!" `
`"............" `
`"Wh-What happened to your answer? `
`Your answer...!" `
`"............ `
`......Su-re." `
`"...Very well, that will do. `
`...Well, there is still much to do for the resurrection ceremony. `
`You still have to kill five people... `
`You should do it without toying with them too much, with beauty and dignity, `
`...and with at least a little restraint, okay...? `
`What Ronove told you about how I did it...that was a bad example. `
`You mustn't use that as a model. `
`Engrave that into your heart." `
`"......Yes, Predecessor-sama." `
`"A good answer. `
`...Ronove, the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, arise...!" `
`"...Yes, Milady. `
`I, Ronove, am here." `
`"Lucifer of Pride, right here." `
`"...Up until this point, umm, I've been a little flashy, but... `
`umm, `
`...well, the dignity of the Golden Witch is also important, `
`and about that..." `
`As Ronove laughed at Beato's uncharacteristically flustered speech, `
`he summed it up for her. `
`"Certainly. `
`From now on, we will be careful to act in a graceful manner, suitable for the name of the Golden Witch. `
`...Even the Seven Sisters of Purgatory will reform their bad behavior up until now, `
`and we shall espouse to perform our task in the quickest possible manner. `
`...Would that be acceptable, Milady?" `
`"I-Indeed. `
`That's it, more or less. `
`Everyone, take it to heart! `
`Okay...?!" `
`"Yes. `
`Certainly." `
`"That is all I wish to say. `
`...You may leave now." `
`"Certainly. `
`If you would excuse me." `
`"Excuse us." `
`"............" `
`"Well, ...that's all I want to say. `
`So, take care as you move forward, understand? `
`Act with dignity, and...umm, restraint, okay? `
`...Give it your all. `
`I will be watching over you." `
`Acting awkwardly until the very end, Beato left that message `
`and immediately became a cloud of gold butterflies, hiding her form in the empty air. `
`Maybe it'd be more accurate to say she vanished in a hurry because she couldn't keep up the conversation. `
`After that, all that remained was Maria's corpse, lying down and pounded by the rain, `
`Rosa's corpse, propped up by the fence and staring up at the sky... `
`...And the figure of the witch. `
`".........Show some restraint, ...you say...?" `
`Her expression looked just a little bored. `
`There was a popping sound. `
`...That was probably her clicking her tongue. `
`".................. `
`............What a boring person." `
`Leaving that last sentence behind, she once again vanished into the empty air... `
