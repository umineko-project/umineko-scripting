`...Even though it was a pitch-black world where nothing could be seen, `
`...for some reason, I felt Beato's presence right next to me. `
`...So I tried calling out to her. `
`...You can exchange words with someone whether they're a human or a witch. `
`...So even in a world where witches have been denied, ...I should be allowed to talk to her... `
`"......Beato..." `
`"...Battler, is it...? `
`.........It is done. `
`...I...did it." `
`"Yeah. `
`...I didn't hear it, `
`......but I watched you until the very end... `
`I definitely saw you...boldly stand up to that evil witch..." `
`"......With this, ...I am no longer a witch. `
`.........But I will definitely...become a witch again... `
`...And then, `
`...I will make it so that I can be called the Golden Witch again, `
`......and once again, `
`......return... `
`so that I can be accepted as your opponent......" `
`"No. `
`......You...were a witch." `
`"......Huh...?" `
`"...I...saw it. `
`......When you took that evil witch, `
`...and blew her away with that awesome magic, exposing her true form, `
`...I saw it with my own eyes..." `
`"Th-That wasn't magic, `
`...but the red-" `
`"No, it was magic. `
`......You were definitely...the Golden Witch. `
`......Even if you deny it yourself, `
`......I'll acknowledge it. `
`'You are definitely... `
`the Golden Witch'." `
`...When Battler said those words... `
`In the world that had been dark, ...there was suddenly a single grain. `
`...A small grain of gold, like a wheat seed, shone brightly. `
`And...even though it was small, it had a strong, gold-colored sparkle. `
`Then, ...it shone on the two of them, sitting with their backs together... `
`So, they each became aware of their own form. `
`...They did not exist only as consciousness. `
`...They became aware that they had bodies and definitely existed. `
`...No, perhaps we should say that they each had been given an existence called a body. `
`When Battler looked at his own form, he wasn't that surprised. `
`...But when Beato looked at her own form, she was a little startled. `
`...From Battler's perspective, she looked just like normal, `
`...but for a short while, she was surprised by that form... `
`"...What... `
`...is going on......?" `
`"The sparkle from that grain of light...is slowly getting stronger..." `
`That grain of wheat was no longer simply gold-colored, but was like the light of the sun. `
`Then, it softly......began to approach Beato's chest. `
`When that grain of the sun...was sucked inside her chest- `
`...The world was wrapped in a deep blue sky, and then a deep blue ocean was spread out below them. `
`An island rose up, trees sprouted and created a forest, walls surrounded us and a ceiling swallowed us. `
`And was adorned with more and more things, `
`...made to be like the hall in the Ushiromiya mansion. `
`In the middle of the fantastical hall where many gold butterflies beat their wings, `
`...many tables were set up with white tablecloths, like it was a party, `
`and beautiful cooking and fruits were set out. `
`...And over there...were a great many shapes. `
`It was everyone talking together and smiling. `
`"...E-Everyone......" `
`There was Dad and Kyrie-san, Uncle Krauss, Aunt Natsuhi and Aunt Rosa, and of course, even Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi. `
`...George-aniki, Jessica, Maria, ...wait, wait, even Shannon-chan, Kanon-kun, Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san are here. `
`Everyone, everyone was at the party, clapping their hands and celebrating our return... `
`"Wh-Why...? `
`Even though everyone was dead...! `
`Why are they alive...?!" `
`"...In the Golden Land, the souls of all the dead can be revived. `
`...Welcome back, {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`And welcome, Battler-kun. `
`Welcome to the Golden Land." `
`"......I...made it? `
`...I made it... `
`to the door of the Golden Land?" `
`"Yes. `
`...Milady, you have finally managed to invite everyone here. `
`Welcome, Battler-sama, to the Golden Land." `
`"Battler. `
`......So, you have finally made it this far." `
`"G-Grandfather, `
`......where in the world...am I...?" `
`"My...blood, which is incompatible with magic, runs most deeply in your veins. `
`...Therefore, you were the only one who could not reach the Golden Land, and {f:5:Beatrice} has been searching for you this whole time. `
`...She tried everything to bring you here." `
`"......What did you say...?" `
`"It seems that we are all here at last." `
`"Battler-sama, if you would take your seat. `
`Tonight's dinner is my very best work. `
`If you would, please relish it." `
`"You should be honored!! `
`Normally, I would've eaten all of it, but I left you some out of gratitude!" `
`"...The Seven Stakes nee-chans..." `
`"In the Golden Land, all of those with minds are equal. `
`...Here, there is no distinction between us furniture, Humans, and witches." `
`"...Battler-sama, `
`we were waiting for you. `
`Welcome to the Golden Land..." `
`"Shannon-chan, ...George-aniki...!!" `
`"...I still feel like this might be a dream... `
`We should have died. `
`...But...I'm alive. `
`And everyone...everyone is here...and happy. `
`...I can't believe it." `
`"That's right, this place must be a dream wooorld! `
`So it must be a dream that George is acting so friendly with a maid girl! `
`Whaaaaaah!" `
`"Could you give it a rest, Eva? `
`For now, you gotta stay quiet and bless the two young'uns. `
`The Golden Land is a city of bliss. `
`We should never quarrel here...!" `
`"Here, any people are free to love each other. `
`...No one needs to hesitate over it." `
`"Jessica-chan, Kanon-kun, you look so wonderfuul! `
`I'm jealo-us!" `
`"...H-Hey, Battler... `
`I'm a little, umm, wahahahaha..." `
`"Battler-sama, welcome. `
`And welcome home..." `
`Jessica was probably embarrassed because she was holding hands with Kanon-kun. `
`Kanon-kun wanted to act humbly like a servant and bow, `
`but since neither of them could let go of the other's hand, he couldn't do it so well, and the whole scene looked fairly comical. `
`"With a servant child...?!! `
`You can't, our Jessica cannot do such a thing...!!" `
`"It's hardly a big deal, correct? `
`Let her at least choose the person she likes." `
`"She can't, she can't, aaaaaaaaaahhh, Jessicaaaaaaaaa!" `
`"You can't eitheeeeeer, Geooooooooorge!" `
`...As Aunt Natsuhi and Aunt Eva hugged each other, they cried tears of regret for their adorable children. `
`...Even though they had always been at odds. `
`...It was a very bizarre scene. `
`"...It isn't really a problem, right? `
`It doesn't matter who likes who." `
`"That's right. `
`It's proof that a parent's too attached to their child." `
`"Battleer, `
`no matter what kind of woman you bring home, I'll give her a warm welcome, okay?" `
`"Don't you dare introduce her to this man, okay? `
`He'll get his hands on her immediately. `
`They'll run off together right away." `
`"......Battler. `
`You finally came here. `
`Kihhihihihihihihihi." `
`"Maria, `
`......from the very beginning, `
`...you knew we'd be coming here...?" `
`"Uu-! `
`That's why I wasn't scared at all. `
`Everyone was being a coward and trembling. `
`It was funny!" `
`"...What the hell. `
`...Even though I thought you were the most screwed up, `
`...you actually knew the truth from the beginning." `
`"H-How rude...! `
`I simply cannot forgive you for speaking of Lady {f:5:Maria} in that way!" `
`"Formulating Firing Curve, Attack Preparations Ready. `
`Lady {f:5:Maria}, we can attack at any time. `
`Nihi!" `
`"Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi...! `
`Ouch!" `
`"...Be quiet. `
`You are in the presence of {f:5:Beatrice}-sama." `
`"Come now, no need to be so stiff. `
`Let's be considerate of their desire to joke around and have fun. `
`More importantly, why don't we begin preparing for the toast?" `
`"Yes, preparations for my excellent mackerel cooking are complete. `
`I can serve it at any time." `
`"Hey!! You people! `
`Work a little more like furniture!!" `
`"Nooooo!! `
`I'm gonna stuff myself some mo-re! `
`Uu-aaah!" `
`"Come on, let's work. `
`Don't keep the guests waiting. `
`Let's work studiously and attend to them. `
`Don't let the guests do anything. `
`Make them lazy, make them slothful, fatten them like pigs. `
`Ahhahaha!" `
`"...{f:5:Beatrice}. `
`Battler-kun. `
`This way." `
`Grandfather and {f:5:Virgilia} were standing on the landing at the top of the staircase, beckoning to us. `
`Beato and I turned our heads to see what was going on, then climbed the stairs together. `
`From the hall, it looked like a very high stage. `
`A small table had been set up there, as well as a piece of parchment and an old-fashioned quill pen. `
`I saw that strange magical characters and Japanese were written side by side. `
`...And below it, many names were written. `
`There were 17 of them. `
`...Grandfather was the first, and everyone's names had been signed all over it. `
`The people who arrived at the Golden Land probably signed this one after another. `
`"Battler, `
`now that you are here, everyone is gathered. `
`Listen carefully." `
`"The Golden Land is not a world supported by the power of magic alone. `
`The cooperation and approval of all humans who receive happiness here is required. `
`For that sake, we must gather the signatures of everyone here." `
`"Last time, `
`the door to the Golden Land was finally opened, but you refused to sign. `
`...Although you probably don't remember it. `
`Because you refused to sign, this world was once again sealed in darkness." `
`"...Just hearing it like that, ...it kinda sounds like I'm the only stubborn one, `
`and that I've been a bother to everyone in various ways..." `
`"That's because your stubbornness is the real deal. `
`It seems you received more than just blood from Kinzo." `
`Beato laughed amiably. `
`I should've felt like she was making fun of me, but without thinking, I went along with her, laughing and smiling. `
`"Magic is a miracle. `
`...Miracles cannot be made complete unless everyone believes. `
`...And, when you believed in the end, this miracle, ...the Golden Land, was completed." `
`".........It looks like I've been a real pain. `
`...So, what should I do...?" `
`"First, sign here. `
`Then, {f:5:Beatrice}, you sign here." `
`"...Quill pens are pretty hard to use, huh? `
`...Whoa, it shot." `
`"You klutz. `
`Shooting ink is a bad omen. `
`Can't you at least write your name quickly? `
`Your pen's wriggling all over the place like a worm. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!" `
`"You should talk...! `
`Don't write it in {c:86EF9C:katakana}! `
`{f:5:Beatrice} is a stylish name, so write it in cursive! `
`You're making the quill and your name cry!" `
`"Sh-Shut up, in school, didn't they tell you not to use cursive on tests?" `
`"Hey, this is a solemn ceremony. Be silent." `
`"Very well. `
`We have gathered the two signatures, as well as the form for the covenant. `
`...Both of you, your oath please. `
`We'll start with {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`Put your hand on the covenant and take the oath." `
`"..."As a good witch, {f:5:Beatrice} swears to continue her studies from this point forth to bring happiness to the people". `
`...Say it." `
`"...I-Indeed... `
`...I-It's a little embarrassing. `
`...As a good witch, `
`{f:5:Beatrice} swears to continue her studies from this point forth to bring happiness to the people. `
`...Will that do?" `
`"Acceptable. `
`Battler is next." `
`"In the same way, Battler-kun, `
`put your hand on the covenant and take the oath. `
`..."As a member of the Golden Land, Ushiromiya Battler swears to serve for the sake of his own happiness and that of his neighbor"." `
`"Ah, `
`...as a member of the Golden Land, `
`Ushiromiya Battler swears to serve for the sake of his own happiness and that of his neighbor. `
`...I'm embarrassed too..." `
`"Listen, everyone...!! `
`Here and now, we have gathered the oaths of all 18 humans who accept the Golden Land...!!" `
`When Kinzo proclaimed that, everyone applauded at once, praising us. `
`...Since I had been the only stubborn one and had just been a pain, I felt a little bad about being the most celebrated one. `
`"And with that, in accordance with the ancient rites, we ask Battler-kun, the last to make the oath, to sign the invitation to the Golden Land. `
`...This is something that invites the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, to the Golden Land. `
`The Golden Land welcomes the Golden Witch through a consensus of those who have acknowledged it...and becomes complete." `
`"Battler, I will read it out loud. `
`Listen carefully. `
`......"The 18 of us accept {f:5:Beatrice} as the Golden Witch and welcome her to the Golden Land"." `
`"What's going on with you? You won't be invited unless I send an invitation?" `
`"That does seem to be the ceremony. `
`It feels stiff even to me. `
`Why don't we end it quickly? `
`I've been so hungry for a while now." `
`"...Come to think of it, I've only been pecking at canned food and haven't eaten anything good. `
`Let's quickly finish this signing." `
`"What's this? `
`"I acknowledge you as a witch". `
`......Huh? `
`That's pretty simple. `
`Damn you Grandfather, exaggerating it so much." `
`"Come on, come on, quickly." `
`"Sign, right here." `
`"......Huh...?" `
`"Quickly." `
`"Sign." `
`...With slightly weird and uncomfortable smiles, the two of them started demanding that I sign... `
`At that time, an incredible sound like that of a glass window breaking reverberated through the hall, `
`and the bustling tumult faded back into complete silence. `
`I dropped the quill pen and turned around, trying to see what had happened. `
`When I did, `
`......where had she come from? `
`...A human who clearly hadn't been there a short while ago was in the very center of the hall, ...looking up at us. `
`Who's that...? `
`...A girl? `
`She's probably about the same age as Jessica and me. `
`...But I didn't know that face. `
`None of the other people here knew that face either. `
`"...Wh-Who are you?! `
`Who is this?! `
`Where did you come from?! `
`Those without invitations are not needed at my party. `
`Servants, kick her out!!" `
`"As you command!! `
`Surround her!!" `
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory surrounded her from seven directions, taking out magic blades that drew purple curves and blocking her. `
`And from out of nowhere, shuffling goat-head servants appeared in great numbers, surrounding that girl. `
`On top of that, the Chiester Sisters stood in front of Beato like a wall, readying a golden bow and pulling back the bowstring... `
`"............" `
`But the girl didn't move at all. `
`...On the contrary, she was still staring at us on the landing, as though she didn't mind at all. `
`...Who is she looking at...? `
`Beato? `
`Grandfather? `
`......Could it be...me......? `
`Yes. `
`...The girl was staring straight into my eyes, ...glaring. `
`Then, after our eyes met perfectly, she yelled. `
`"You mustn't sign that!!! `
`Are you going to accept your own defeat?! `
`Don't be tricked by the witch!!!" `
`"...Huh? `
`By the witch, `
`...huh?!" `
`At that time, something incredibly strong lifted me by the nape of my neck. `
`...Wh-What's going on...?! `
`And after being made to turn around behind me, `
`...I saw {f:5:Virgilia}, with an eerie smile on her face, and the muscular forms of goat monsters... `
`A goat monster that looked about 2 meters tall was grabbing me with an arm as thick as a log...! `
`"Hohhohohohohohohohohohoho... `
`There is no need to listen to an uninvited guest. `
`Come, offer your signature as well. `
`On this written oath. `
`"Ushiromiya Battler acknowledges the existence of witches". `
`Come now, sign the written oath...!!" `
`"Ow, ...owowowowowowowowowowowow!! `
`D‐damn it, let go!!!" `
`As the goat monsters held me down with the power of a vise, they forced me to grab the quill pen. `
`...I couldn't even touch the floor with my feet, much less resist...! `
`"Battleer, why are you resisting? `
`Weren't you just about to sign willingly...? `
`Don't change your mind now, after all that, okaaay? `
`Didn't you think for an instant...that it might be okay to acknowledge witches? `
`You thought that, riiiiiight? `
`Kukkikikikkakkakakakakakakakakaka!!" `
`"............I, `
`I was... `
`t- `
`tricked...? `
`That's insane...... `
`Beato isn't that kind of..." `
`"............" `
`"...H-Hihhihahhahhahaaaaaaaaah!! `
`Sorry, Battleer, I am that kind of persooooooooooon!! `
`Aah, it's useless now, it looks like sentimental sob stories don't suit meeeeeeeeeee!! `
`Teacher, I'm counting on you to use all your strength!! `
`That was such a plain role to play, and I got so bored!" `
`"I don't know who you are, girl, `
`but I'll beat you to death, mash you and crush you until threads start trailing, okaaaaaaaaaaaayy?! `
`I'll make you regret being born a womaaaaaaaaaaaan, `
`hyahhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!" `
`As Beato waved her gold pipe, `
`the massive chandelier hanging in the hall was electrocuted, and from that, a terrible purple thunderbolt fell...! `
`It should have been a direct hit on the girl right below it, turning her to ash. `
`However, ...not a single hair was singed. `
`"Hoh...!! `
`So, your sudden appearance here wasn't just a fluke...!! `
`Tell me! State your name!!" `
`"I don't have any name to give you. `
`......More importantly, `
`...you idiot!!! `
`How long are you going to be tricked?!! `
`You softy!! `
`Figure it out already!! `
`This is all the witch's trap!!" `
`Those words were aimed at me. `
`...This is all... `
`the witch's trap, she says...? `
`That can't be... `
`Beato reformed and swore to become a good witch... `
`"......Beato......... `
`...All this about traps... `
`...It's a lie, right...? `
`Please, ......tell me it's a lie..." `
`"...Sorry, Battleer. `
`It was pretty fun. `
`...Sure, I just did what Teacher told me, but look how great it turned out!" `
`"Apparently, if you start out all hostile and needlessly brutal, then turn incompetent and soft at just the right moment, you can spark a huge bump on your affection meter, riiight?" `
`"I've heard villains who start all lovey-dovey and then freak the shit out are all the rage these days, riiiiiight? `
`Even I've studied a bunch of those manga, anime, and galge that've been so popular lately, you seeee?" `
`"And for you, just as expected, it was "tears please", and you're down!! `
`Hihhyahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahaha, i-diot, what a truly simple person!! `
`I'll call this "the North Wind and the Sun Strategy". `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!" `
`"...That's not...... `
`............D‐ `
`Damn you, `
`...you bastard... `
`How dare you deceive me like this...!!" `
`"............... `
`...Yes, that expression suits you the most. `
`That caring expression of yours really doesn't suit me after all. `
`It made my back itch, and I was frantically trying not to let it get to me. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!" `
`"Too bad, witches never refooorm{p:0:☆} `
`Hyaahhahhahhahhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!! `
`You take care of the signature, Teacher! `
`This uninvited guest is my prey!!" `
`"Come, you can no longer refuse to sign. `
`...Come on, look. `
`Sign it and offer your body, your mind, and your soul...!!" `
`When {f:5:Virgilia} lifted her chin as a signal, the goat monsters, with an even more vise-like power, `
`forced my arm to approach the parchment...! `
`Owowowow, ...these guys are trying to make me sign, even if it breaks my arm... `
`Then, a bright red light burst open with me at the center, knocking the witches and the goat monsters away. `
`Did that girl save me...?! `
`B-But who in the world is that? I don't have a clue! `
`"How long do you plan to keep playing in a place like this...? `
`Give it a rest. `
`I'm jealous of you." `
`"......I-I'm glad you saved me, but that's a pretty cruel way to say it. `
`...Sorry, but who are you...?" `
`"......... `
`......Witch of Rokkenjima!! `
`Give him back!!" `
`"Kuhhahahahahahahahah!! `
`Who would do that, you fool?!! `
`Battler is my toy. `
`My most favorite toy in the world...!! `
`I won't get tired of him, I won't throw him away, and I won't hand him over to anyone!! `
`Even Battler is enjoying this to the fullest. `
`Together with me, he is having so much fun playing. `
`No matter who you are, I won't let you get in the way...!!" `
`"Yeah, it looks like you're having a lot of fun. It makes me so jealous, it ticks me off!! `
`Here you are, in a place like this, guffawing and having a loud, noisy time with everyone!" `
`"With all these beautiful witches around to pamper you, `
`you must be having so much fun that you don't even want to go back!!" `
`"...A-Are you talking to me...? `
`Wait, wait, you've got the wrong idea...! `
`This is a pain for me too! `
`What do you mean, fun? You don't know what I've been through...!" `
`"What troubles?!!! `
`You get to have fun living with Mom and Dad, you get to play around happily with all of the cousins, `
`you get to play with pleasant witches as long as you want for all eternity!" `
`"Don't you realize the happiness you have?! `
`I'm jealous of all of you, don't you get it?! `
`I'd love to be part of all this!!" `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!! `
`I'm sorry, but I'll have to turn you down there. `
`I am satisfied with the toy I have. `
`A rude toy like you is not fitting for my toy box!" `
`"Yes, I understand. `
`Who would ever play with someone like you? `
`...But I will thank you just a little. `
`...For letting me meet everyone like this." `
`"...Who... `
`...are you...? `
`............You couldn't be..." `
`"I see, is that it...? `
`......Yes, I understand, I know who you are! `
`...I see, `
`so you are the piece Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} threw in. `
`How amusing!!" `
`"Why don't I formally invite you to my party?!! `
`I'll welcome you fully...!! `
`Along with Battler, I'll play nicely, break you, kill you, crush you, turn you to ash, mix you with bread dough and bake you until you're fluffy!! `
`Fuhhahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaahh!!" `
`"......Aaah, it's useless, it's all useless! `
`You can't do that! `
`On the Rokkenjima of 1986, `
`...I'll expose everything that happened to the light of day!" `
`"I'll show you that before the truth, you're like an icicle scared of the coming spring! `
`Prepare yourself, Golden Witch! `
`{f:5:Beatrice}!!!" `
