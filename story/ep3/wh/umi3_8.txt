`There would've been no way to tell that morning had come without opening a window and looking up at the cloudy sky, which had become a tiny bit lighter. `
`It wasn't a refreshing morning. `
`All that could be heard was the sound of the rain, which hadn't stopped falling since last night, and the howl of the wind... `
`"...It's hard to imagine that it's morning. `
`This horrible weather speaks for our hearts." `
`"Hey, it could be worse. `
`At least it's just rain and not spears falling from the sky." `
`"Wahhaha. `
`Whether it's rain or spears, it's comin' down with a bang. `
`......Is it already 6:00? `
`Fuaaaaaa... `
`Isn't this enough? `
`After this, we've got no measures we can take 'til the mystery 19th person, Beatrice, makes her move." `
`"True. `
`...However, I believe we have anticipated every trick they might use against us." `
`"That's right. `
`As long as a traitor doesn't appear among the siblings, we should be able to deal with most situations." `
`"...Haven't we talked about this enough? `
`We've stayed up all night. `
`...I'm tired." `
`"You're right. `
`How about taking a little rest after eating breakfast?" `
`"...A good plan. `
`Staying up all night is trying at our age." `
`As they all stretched, they enjoyed this unrefreshing morning as best they could. `
`"I'll go wash my face or something. `
`I probably look horrible." `
`".........? `
`What is that awful stench?" `
`As soon as they exited into the corridor, Kyrie openly made a disgusted expression. `
`"...What is it?" `
`"Hey, don't you smell something awful...?" `
`"......Nnn. `
`...What is this stench? `
`I can't stand it..." `
`After hearing those complaints, everyone stuck their heads out into the corridor. `
`...The stench was faint, but once people started commenting on it, it was clearly noticeable. `
`Each of them went into the corridor, relying on their own sense of smell to tell them where this strange odor was coming from... `
`"What in the world could it be? `
`Let us have Genji deal with it. `
`I believe he should already have arrived in the servant room to begin the morning preparations." `
`"Indeed, please do. `
`At the very least, it's difficult to imagine `
`Gohda making a breakfast that would cause such an odor..." `
`Rudolf and the others searched for the source of the smell...and determined that it was coming from underground, `
`from the boiler room. `
`But the door was locked, and they couldn't check inside. `
`At the same time, when Natsuhi's group was on its way to search for someone in the servant room, they noticed something strange near the parlor. `
`"...What is this...?!" `
`"Wh-What a horrible prank... `
`Who would do something like this...?" `
`On the door to the parlor, drawn in a paint that looked like blood, was a strange... `
`thing that looked like a magic circle. `
`"There's no one in the kitchen yet. `
`...Wh-What is...that?" `
`Eva's group, who'd thought the smell might be coming from the kitchen, `
`had returned after confirming that no one was there and that preparations for breakfast had not yet begun. `
`...Then, they noticed the change to the parlor. `
`"It's useless, the boiler room's locked. `
`Wouldn't that be bad if something went wrong with the boiler? `
`Has anyone spotted a servant?" `
`"......! `
`Is one of those vulgar scribbles here too? `
`There was another one on the door to the boiler room." `
`"What's that?! `
`This creepy scribble isn't just here, but it's in other places too?! `
`Haha, you don't think this is the witch of the forest Beatrice's declaration of war, do ya?" `
`Hideyoshi tried to make fun of it, but staring at this creepy magic circle while listening to the wind and rain really made it seem like a message from a witch. `
`...The dripping, bright-red paint made one think of blood, which made it even creepier. `
`Hideyoshi tried to open the door, but it had been locked. `
`...As a general rule, the parlor wasn't locked. `
`Someone had gone out of their way to lock it. `
`"...What does this mean...? `
`Could it be that, while we were talking in the dining hall, someone secretly left this scribble? `
`On the doors to the parlor and the boiler room?" `
`"...I'm sure the servants are behind this. `
`We were together the whole time. `
`We all have alibis. `
`...They probably received some strange order from Father and pulled this prank." `
`"......And there's also the case yesterday with Maria-chan's letter. `
`It's really easy to suspect that the servants are acting on Dad's orders and planning something. `
`...Anyway, where is everyone? `
`They can't be playing hide and seek. `
`Let's look for them." `
`"B-Before that, I'm worried about the children. `
`They are safe, right? `
`I'll go and check, and while I'm there, I'll see if there aren't any servants there." `
`"Then let's split up. `
`While you go to the guesthouse to see how the brats are doing, we'll investigate inside the mansion." `
`"......I don't want to think about it, `
`but maybe these creepy magic circles aren't just in the places we've found them already." `
`"...We might be wrapped up in some bizarre game of Father's. `
`...I will go to him and hear the situation. `
`...Though, I doubt he'll obediently listen to me." `
`The adults split up. `
`As a result, they confirmed that the four children were safe in the so-called cousins' room, on the second floor of the guesthouse. `
`They had apparently stayed up late last night playing. `
`All of them were snoring loudly, so Rosa decided not to wake them. `
`Furthermore, Nanjo, who had returned early the previous night to rest, was also safe. `
`It seemed he believed in the phrase "early to bed, early to rise" and had awoken refreshed. `
`During that time, Kyrie and Hideyoshi searched for the servants. `
`But they didn't find them. `
`...The servant room in the guesthouse was also empty. `
`"...The children are safe. `
`They all stayed up too late last night." `
`"The servant room is empty. `
`I looked at the shift chart, and the mornin' shift begins at 6:00. `
`They should've started workin' by now..." `
`"The nap room is also empty. `
`There were signs that a futon had been slept in, but it wasn't warm." `
`"Hey, ...isn't everyone's reasonin' right on this? `
`...This is probably a game Father set up. `
`He must've left those creepy scribbles and hid himself somewhere, `
`tryin' to make us do somethin'." `
`"...Are you saying he's trying to see who's fit to succeed his wealth and the Headship? `
`...Isn't that a bit..." `
`"No... `
`...It might not be strange if Father was behind something like that." `
`"After all, Father loves doing things on a big scale. `
`...This might've been a finely-tuned plan startin' as far back as when the epitaph was hung in the hall." `
`"...In that case, I wonder if they'll give us an announcement of the game or some explanation of it. `
`...It certainly would be nice if an envelope with the crest, like the one handed to Maria-chan, were to appear." `
`"......That's right. `
`Maybe Nii-san and the rest have found something like that in the mansion." `
`"Doctor Nanjo, `
`have you heard anythin' about this?" `
`"...M-My apologies, I have no idea what is going on. `
`And yet...yes, certainly, `
`I could easily imagine Kinzo-san planning something on a big scale." `
`"...Shouldn't we go back to the mansion for now? `
`Maybe they found somethin' over there." `
`"If I won't be in the way, I shall go too." `
`"I-I'll stay here. `
`...The children are sleeping upstairs. `
`We don't know what's happening. `
`We cannot leave them alone." `
`"...That's right. `
`I'll stay with Rosa-san and watch over the place. `
`Would you tell that to my husband?" `
`Rosa and Kyrie remained in the guesthouse. `
`Hideyoshi went with Nanjo and returned again to the mansion. `
`At the same time, in the mansion... `
`In a way that was hard to believe, ...or maybe we should say in a way that gave him a bad feeling... `
`Rudolf's prediction was spot on. `
`...The same magic circle graffiti that had been drawn on the doors to the boiler room and the parlor...had been found in multiple places throughout the mansion. `
`"Aniki...! `
`How's Dad?" `
`"It was no use. `
`I received no response. `
`I tried putting my ear against the door, but I couldn't sense anyone." `
`"...There's no sign of any of the servants. `
`...Where in the world did they disappear to...?" `
`"This isn't funny. `
`Father and the servants are hiding, and there are strange magic circles all over the mansion. `
`...What in the world is happening...?!" `
`There weren't only magic circles on the door to the boiler room and the door to the parlor. `
`There were two on the second floor... `
`and one on the third floor, for a total of five. `
`They were all the same magic circle, and all of the doors had been locked, so they couldn't check inside the rooms. `
`"...Anyway, let's do something about the boiler room first. `
`It'd be bad if something broke down and caught fire or exploded. `
`...So we need the key." `
`"It should be in the key box in the servant room." `
`They fished through that key box. `
`Because each of the servants carried their master keys around, those weren't kept there. `
`However, all of the individual keys should have been there. `
`"......I can't believe they managed to fit so many keys in there." `
`"...It isn't here. `
`No matter how much we look, the key to the boiler room isn't here." `
`"Look, Aneki. `
`...Only the keys to the rooms with those magic circles drawn on them... `
`are totally missing." `
`"...It's true. `
`...How bothersome..." `
`"It's as though someone didn't want us to go into the rooms with the magic circles. `
`...No, they went to all the trouble of making those magic circles obvious, so maybe they wanted us to enter..." `
`"I think it's the latter. `
`...This isn't a movie, so breaking down the door is probably impossible. `
`Smashing a window might do the trick though." `
`For a while, Krauss pondered over whether this situation really called for smashing a window. `
`At that time, Hideyoshi and Nanjo returned. `
`There was nothing strange in the guesthouse, and the children were safe. `
`They told the others that Rosa and Kyrie had stayed to watch over the place. `
`"Good morning. `
`...I heard that something strange has happened." `
`"Good morning, Doctor Nanjo. `
`...I apologize for waking you so early in the morning." `
`"What is it? `
`Did you find a letter or somethin'? `
`I was sure you'd have found somethin' like that by now..." `
`"...You're right. `
`I also believe this to be a massive joke or game of Father's... `
`But if that's the case, there should be some letter telling us about it. `
`Like the letter that was given to Maria-chan." `
`"What if Maria-chan's letter actually was the announcement, telling us that the game was on? `
`The rules of the game, "try solving the riddle of the epitaph", have already been made clear." `
`"Then what might the five magic circles we found in the mansion represent? `
`...And the missing servants?" `
`"...Natsuhi nee-san, `
`how many servants were there today in total...?" `
`"Huh? `
`......Genji, Gohda... `
`...five of them, but why?" `
`"...So, there are five servants. `
`There are also five magic circles. `
`...It's probably a coincidence, but I don't like it." `
`"...Nii-san, `
`let's break a window. `
`We should check and see what's inside." `
`"......We have no choice. `
`Do it neatly." `
`Krauss made his decision and gave permission to smash a window. `
`And he decided that the first room they would break into should be the parlor on the first floor, where the windows would be easiest to reach. `
`They had hoped to peek in through the window, `
`but the curtains were down, so they couldn't see inside. `
`Rudolf wandered around the garden, trying to find something that would be good for smashing the window. `
`Eventually, he found a rock bigger than a fist and came back. `
`"You don't have to smash the whole thing. `
`Just open it enough so you can reach the lock." `
`"Don't get your hopes up, okay?" `
`Rudolf raised the rock and hit the glass with it several times. `
`Eventually, he succeeded in opening a hole big enough that he could unlock it from the outside. `
`...Covering his hand with a handkerchief, he stuck his hand through that hole...and cautiously unlocked it. `
`"We should probably cover it with packing tape later. `
`The rain'll get blown in." `
`When he suddenly opened the window, the wind and rain made the curtain dance around violently. `
`That curtain was blown to the side. `
`...They could see into the parlor they knew well. `
`They were a little relieved. `
`...They'd thought there might be another bizarre magic circle inside the room, `
`or possibly the traces of some creepy ceremony. `
`In any event, they didn't want to hang around out in the rain, `
`so the six of them: Krauss, Natsuhi, Eva, Hideyoshi, Rudolf, and Nanjo, entered the parlor as a group. `
`"...It seems...that nothing in particular has changed..." `
`"......Nn-" `
`"Wh-What's wrong, Shannon...?!" `
`"Wait, wait, are you okay?! `
`What happened to you?!" `
`"Blood, blood!! `
`D-D-Doctor Nanjo, take a look at this!!" `
`"Hey, Shannon-chan! `
`Are you okay?! `
`Answer me!" `
`"Y-You mustn't shake her... `
`I will examine her condition now..." `
`She had been in the shadow of the sofa, so they hadn't noticed her until they'd entered the room. `
`Shannon was lying on the floor, her chest stained bright-red with blood... `
`"He-y, `
`Battleeer, where are yoooou? `
`Look, look, Shannon's corpse has turned up, seeee? `
`I won't bully you anymore, so come out." `
`"...Hmmmm? `
`Oh, there you are. `
`What are you doing, clutching at your head in a place like that?" `
`"............" `
`Battler was crouching under the table, holding his head... `
`His pitiful figure made it plainly clear that he didn't want to see anything, didn't want to hear anything... `
`Had he heard Beatrice's sneering voice? `
`...Could he not hear, or was he pretending that he couldn't hear? `
`In any event, it was clear that he'd closed up his heart like a shell... `
`"Pu ku ku ku... `
`...Perhaps you tormented him too much, Milady. `
`After showing him all that and demanding a counterargument, `
`I can understand why'd he want to mope around." `
`"Hey, Battleeer. `
`If you can't argue back, then resign, okay? `
`It's your turn. `
`If you don't make some move or pass... `
`or else give up, we won't get anywhere." `
`"............et." `
`"...Huh? `
`What's that? `
`I can't hear you?" `
`"I said BE QUIET!! `
`Aaaah, shut up, shut uuuuuuuuuuuup!! `
`A witch? Magic?! `
`Why don't you just do whatever you want?! I don't believe, I don't believe any of it, `
`dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit!!" `
`"Don't talk to me, don't show me anything, disappear, disappear, just disappear!! `
`Don't get that annoying face near meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!" `
`".........!" `
`Beatrice winced reflecively at Battler's sudden rage. `
`"...E-Even if you say that... `
`If you don't finish your turn, then my turn won't come. `
`In fact, I'm the one asking you to stop boring me..." `
`"Who cares, be quiet, shut uuup!! `
`Who cares about your game?! `
`I won't go along with iiiiit!! `
`If your turn won't come until mine's finished, then just wait for all eternity!! `
`Aaaah, I don't know, I don't know, I don't get it!! `
`I won't accept witches or magic, I won't accept something that screwed up!! `
`Uuooooooooooohhh, I said don't talk to meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!" `
`...I don't know what's what anymore. `
`After being shown something that screwed up, how could I resist...? `
`I wandered aimlessly through the rose garden. `
`...It was raining and windy, but that didn't mean my body got wet. `
`...There was just a feeling of isolation as I wandered amidst the wind and rain without an umbrella. `
`".........Maybe... `
`I lost in that person's game a long time ago." `
`...Actually, didn't we already have a clear winner and loser in the last game? `
`After all, I surrendered for a time. `
`That's why the world was tinted with witches and magic. `
`...Right now, Rokkenjima is a different world, where witches stride around openly and fire off strange spells. `
`...It isn't a matter of accepting it or denying it. `
`Maybe I mistakenly assumed that I was playing a game on an even footing with Beato. `
`Maybe I was already defeated in the last game, ...and this is just the signing ceremony of my surrender. `
`A minute ago, a terrible battle unfolded in this rose garden. `
`I saw it with my own eyes. `
`I kicked the ground. `
`...Obviously, the ground was hard. `
`And water from a puddle splashed. `
`Several towers had split this ground, sprouting like high-rise buildings. `
`...The more I kicked this ground, `
`......the more it felt like that couldn't possibly have happened. `
`But, for that very reason, I couldn't explain it with anything other than magic anymore... `
`"...If it was a closed room with a key shut up inside, `
`I'd know it was probably an extension of stuff you often see in detective novels." `
`"...But that...? `
`That big flashy thing...? `
`Damn it......" `
`"......It seems my disciple has caused you much trouble." `
`"...Huh? `
`......It's you..." `
`Someone suddenly spoke to me, so I turned around, `
`...and in the rose garden arbor... `
`...was the Predecessor Beatrice, whom Beatrice had supposedly defeated a short while ago. `
`"......I was sure you'd died. `
`So, you survived." `
`"No, I did die. `
`...Now, I am nothing more than a defeated chess piece loitering outside the chessboard." `
`"You're Beato's teacher, right? `
`So, in other words, you're a witch too." `
`"...Yes, that is correct." `
`"Tch. `
`So basically, `
`...that means witches really do exist? `
`And the only one who can defeat her...isn't me. `
`That'd be you, since you can use awesome magic, right? `
`...I'm just useless now. `
`There's nothing I can do anymore..." `
`"......Oh, my. `
`Have you surrendered completely?" `
`"What do you mean, surrender?! `
`How am I supposed to explain that?! `
`Towers sprouting and falling!! `
`Huge giants holding shields and throwing spears!" `
`"Aaah, just remembering it makes me feel like I'm going insane! We're way past the point of trying to reason this all out, aren't we?!! `
`We've left the level of tricks and things that can be explained with human culprits!! `
`Aaaaaaaaaaahh, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it!!" `
`"Calm yourself. `
`...I am nothing more than a piece on that child's game board. `
`After being removed from that board, I am no longer a being capable of doing anything. `
`But you are that child's opponent. `
`As long as you do not give up on your own, you will always have the power to strike back." `
`"Shut up! `
`Weren't you also reciting strange spells and summoning towers and spears?!! `
`What do you mean, strike back?! `
`Are you saying you'll teach me magic too, and make me take part in that massive magic battle?!!" `
`"...If you wish, `
`I could teach you a bit about magic." `
`"Oh, just what I wanted! `
`Please, give me some awesome magic to smash through her chest in one blow...!! `
`Hah, don't screw with me!" `
`"I hear that in Japanese magic, there is a ceremony used to pray for rain. `
`Do you know of it?" `
`"A rain ceremony? `
`That thing where you throw stuff into a fire and dance as an offering? `
`...That's not magic. `
`They say that the fire causes an updraft, which makes rain clouds gather. `
`That's supposed to be an accepted scientific phenomenon." `
`"Oh? `
`...I believed it to be a form of Eastern magic, `
`but is that not the case? `
`I believed people offered sacred fire to the heavens, as well as a dance of respect, `
`so that your entreaty for rain would reach the hearts of the gods." `
`"Maybe people did that long ago. `
`But most occult things like that have a scientific explanation." `
`"Why do things burn? `
`Isn't that because phlogiston is contained in the material?" `
`"...No, things burn because of a chemical reaction. `
`Lavoisier abolished the phlogiston theory." `
`"Why does heat transfer through objects? `
`Isn't that because caloric is contained in the material?" `
`"...I'm pretty sure that was abolished by Joule. `
`Heat is energy, not a substance." `
`"You have studied well. `
`Your knowledge is accurate." `
`"...It's just some trivia." `
`"Phlogiston, caloric, and eventually ether and god's love. `
`...All are powerless before a scientific explanation. `
`In the past, I was told that an apple falling from a tree `
`was thanks to god's love, so that humans would be given food." `
`"So, even gravity is the love of god? `
`...Well, that's probably the remnants from the period when religion rather than science was used to explain everything." `
`"That is correct. `
`In the past, humans called the limits of their knowledge... `
`...no, ignorance itself, magic. `
`...Like the rain ceremony we were just talking about." `
`"Did the people of ancient times realize that there was a scientific explanation, `
`that fire gave rise to heat to cause updrafts that summoned clouds? `
`Even without understanding these things, they at least knew the result." `
`"...That probably happened a lot. `
`That stuff called "knowledge of the ancestors". `
`Even without understanding the reason, through long experience, they knew that they'd achieve results. `
`...Phenomena whose principles they didn't understand were probably the same as magic to them." `
`Like this person just said, ancient people who didn't understand those principles probably believed that, `
`through the rain ceremony, their wishes would reach the heavens and make rain fall. `
`To them, that was certainly magic. `
`As long as they didn't understand updrafts... `
`"If you push an electrical switch, a light turns on. `
`...Children do not know the scientific principles behind why a lightbulb lights up, `
`they only know the result when they push the switch. `
`If they obtain such a result without knowing the principles, doesn't that make it magic to them?" `
`"......That's pretty interesting. `
`...Well, logically, that's true. `
`...For example, I don't have a clue why the Braun tubes in a TV show a picture. `
`Still, I think it's totally normal to see things shown on a TV. `
`Even if I don't understand the principles behind Braun tubes, I at least know that "If I push the switch, I can watch TV". `
`...It's exactly the same as having a rain ceremony without understanding updrafts. `
`...In other words, if I don't know the principles, even TV is the same as magic... `
`or even magic itself, I guess." `
`"Do you know the structure of Braun tubes? `
`Have you ever taken one apart and looked inside?" `
`"...Nope. `
`I think I read about it in a book or something once, but it was complicated and I didn't have a clue. `
`I think that when electrons hit a fluorescent material, it creates luminescence or something like that..." `
`"That book lied. `
`Actually, there are small people called gremlins shut up inside the Braun tubes, `
`and they do their work with magic." `
`"Huh?! `
`Don't be stupid, there's no way that's true...!" `
`"How can you deny it, if you have never looked inside a Braun tube?" `
`"...I've never looked inside, but I can say for sure that small people like that definitely don't exist!" `
`"Since there are no Braun tubes here, that is impossible to prove." `
`"Y-Yeah, it's impossible to prove right now, `
`...but later, I can take apart a TV somewhere and show you, and instantly win the argument!" `
`"So, put another way, `
`my "magical theory" that gremlins are shut up inside the Braun tubes and display the picture with magic... `
`is impossible to disprove until we can verify the contents of a Braun tube, correct?" `
`"......Erk, `
`......what the hell, is this one of those? `
`Are you trying to say it's a "Devil's Proof"? `
`That's a favorite trick of you witches." `
`"A "Devil's Proof" is a bit of sophistry, one that takes advantage of the fact that negative facts are impossible to prove. `
`However, it's different from my Braun tubes metaphor. `
`That could be resolved simply by taking apart a single television." `
`"...You're right. `
`It isn't really a "Devil's Proof"." `
`"You have proposed a scientific theory, and I have proposed a magical one. `
`...One of those is the truth. `
`And which one it is can be ascertained the moment you look inside a Braun tube. `
`However, until the instant that happens, we cannot deny each other's theories." `
`"So, even though only one truth exists, `
`until you look into the Braun tube, you can have two conflicting truths existing at the same time. `
`...You have a realm in which two truths can exist simultaneously, even though there must be only one truth in existence." `
`Is the cat in the box alive or dead? `
`If you open the box, you will learn the answer. `
`You will learn the truth. `
`However, until you open the box, you can claim that the cat is alive, and you can also claim that it is dead. `
`Both claims are the "correct" truth according to the people making them, `
`and even though the two sides are in conflict, neither can win the argument as long as the box remains unopened. `
`In other words, two truths can exist at the same time. `
`Even though there can only be one cat in the box, `
`it is packed with a living cat and a dead cat, forming a strange separate world. `
`That is what Rokkenjima is now. `
`...This island is now a different world where a scientific theory and a magical one can exist at the same time. `
`...To a resident of the world of science such as yourself, `
`at a glance, it may feel as though this island had been sucked into a world of magic. `
`That might not be wrong, but it is not accurate. `
`Strictly speaking, it has been moved from the world of science to the gap between that world and the world of magic. `
`So, at a glance, it appears to you as though the world is tilted towards the magical side. `
`...But, in reality, this island is now in a perfectly impartial position with relation to those two opposing worlds. `
`"...I don't really get it... `
`The gap between reality and magic? `
`A perfectly impartial world? `
`How's that? `
`Hasn't pretty much everything that's happened been totally not in my favor...?!" `
`"Then perhaps you could think of it this way. `
`This is a trial. `
`Think of it as a court where you and Beatrice are laying out opposing claims. `
`Call it a Braun tube trial." `
`"Your opponent claims that there are tiny people inside the Braun tubes, `
`explaining one thing after another, `
`talking about the lives of these tiny people, what they look like, what type of magical power they have. `
`...And what do you do?" `
`"...Well, I study in a library and argue back by explaining how Braun tubes are constructed." `
`"At this moment, both your claim and that child's claim exist in the court at the same time. `
`...If you find your opponent's claim convincing, `
`it might sound like truth to you. It might look like truth to you. `
`{i:That is exactly what you saw}." `
`"............" `
`"At this moment, on Rokkenjima, witches and magic certainly may exist as truth. `
`...However, until the moment that the cat's box is opened, that world is an uncertain wave function. `
`The entire situation can be explained by both sides at the same time. `
`However, there is one truth." `
`"That set of truths shrinks with observation, `
`and countless truths are weeded out to become one truth. `
`It is like when, in court, `
`the judge hands down his judgement. `
`The two truths from the prosecutor's and the defense's claims... `
`are reduced in number by the judgement and become one." `
`"......To say it in your words, `
`...this island right now is the world right before looking into a Braun tube, right...? `
`Therefore, the science theory and the magic theory cannot be denied. `
`And since they cannot be denied-" `
`"Both can exist as truth. `
`Therefore, both witches and magic can exist. `
`...However, at the same time, your opinion of denial also exists as truth." `
`"......It is a world where two conflicting things can exist at once. `
`And, it is a world where conflicting truths cannot disprove each other. `
`......Have you managed to understand...?" `
`".........In other words, `
`...no matter how much awesome magic Beato shows me, `
`...it's only a claim of a "magical theory", and it doesn't disprove my position." `
`"So, 'no matter what kind of magic Beato shows me in this world, `
`it cannot become proof that magic exists'." `
`"That's right. `
`That child might even try to explain an apple falling from a tree with magic, `
`perhaps by shaking her staff and magically plucking the apple, `
`then claiming to be the thing that made it drop down to the earth." `
`"However, that would be nothing more than another claim. `
`None of your opponent's claims can prevent you from making yours. `
`...In that sense, this world is quite "impartial" to both sides." `
`"......I...get it... `
`...Still, `
`by that argument, if I show a sound argument with my "science theory", `
`and it collides head on with her "magic theory", I also can't win against her. `
`On top of that, the final judgement won't come until we peek into the Braun tube." `
`"......Where is the Braun tube in this world? `
`...Because it exists, there should be no reason for us to argue. `
`...Why don't we just get along and peek into the Braun tube?" `
`"If there really is a tiny person in there, it's my complete loss. `
`Otherwise, it's my victory. `
`...Why do we have to hold this debate without looking into the Braun tube?" `
`"That itself is the "game" you are being challenged to. `
`Maybe, instead of a court, I should use chess as an example. `
`There, victory and loss are not determined by a judge. `
`You who fight will decide it yourselves." `
`"...Can you win an argument with an opponent in a screwed up world, where multiple truths can exist at the same time?" `
`"In actual fact, didn't you lose an argument and surrender like this...?" `
`".........Heh. `
`...Heheheh." `
`"That is all the advice I can give you now. `
`If you wish, I can occasionally offer you counsel." `
`"...Sure. `
`Thanks, that really helps. `
`...I'll avenge you." `
`"Hohohoh, thank you. `
`I look forward to it." `
`"What's your name?" `
`"...Beatrice used to be my name, but now that I have surrendered it, I do not have a name. `
`......So, I shall take a temporary name. `
`...Virgilius. `
`...No, `
`how about Virgilia?" `
`"Virgilia. `
`Like Valkyria? `
`Wasn't that a name for goddesses that show up in myths?" `
`"No. `
`It means the guide who leads the way to Beatrice. `
`...I will guide you to that child, who waits at the summit of Mount Purgatory. `
`It ought to be a fitting name for such a guide." `
`"Who would've guessed I'd accept help from a witch when I'm trying to deny witches. `
`...I see. `
`If this is a contradictory world where different claims can exist at the same time, I guess that's cool. `
`...Ihihi, it's almost funny." `
`"I am borrowing that child's words, but you truly are like a phoenix. `
`...Your will to fight has already been revived. `
`...Come, if your heart is prepared, return to your opponent, `
`...return to the chessboard where that child is seated. `
`...I look forward to seeing how far you can fight with my disciple." `
`"Yeah, watch it. `
`......I won't listen to her babbling anymore. `
`I'll coolly fight to the end. `
`I definitely won't get provoked by her any longer." `
`"Then let us return. `
`To the seat of the battle." `
`"...O-Oh, Battler...! `
`Where did you run off to? `
`*cackle*! `
`And I thought losers never came back for more." `
`"...Sorry to keep you waiting. `
`I've cooled my head a little." `
`"And? `
`Did you think of a response to that pleasant, thrilling, refreshing, highly acclaimed, wonderful fantasy battle between Teacher and meeeeeeee? `
`Isn't that impossible to explain without fantasy? `
`Hihhyahhahahahahahahahahahahahaah?!" `
`"...Milady, `
`didn't you just promise to be kind and act more gracefully?" `
`"Ahhyahahahahaha, oh no, oh no. `
`I just got in such a good mood when I saw Battler's face, you see? `
`Look, look, look, how are you gonna respond to that battle just now, Battler? `
`Hmmmmmm?" `
`"............ `
`...Battle? `
`What battle?" `
`"...Whaat?" `
`"In this rose garden, `
`where do you see those spears, `
`and towers you made lying around? `
`......They aren't here, are they? `
`...In other words, it's just like the inside of a Braun tube." `
`"...The inside of a Braun tube?? `
`*cackle* What in the world are you talking about now...?" `
`"At this very moment, `
`there's nothing at all in the rose garden. `
`Towers may have been sprouting with magic until a short while ago. `
`However, that's only the case until we see what's inside the Braun tube. `
`...That magical battle is nothing more than your interpretation, your claim. `
`The fact that there's absolutely nothing to see here now proves it." `
`"This is how I argue back about that witch's battle just now. `
`Right now, there isn't anything here, which proves that nothing happened...!" `
`"......... `
`...Hahaha, hahahahaha! `
`Come now, of course I can't make a huge mess when it's only the first twilight, and I am rather fond of that rose garden, you see? `
`To prevent any damage, I had the fight occur inside a barrier. `
`So it's only natural that it wouldn't have any influence on reality." `
`"...That's your claim? `
`Well, I guess that works." `
`"However! `
`At this point in time, there is nothing in the rose garden. `
`So nothing stands in the way of my claim that there was no magic done here!!" `
`"W-Wait, wait, can you deny my magic with a mess like that?! `
`It is impossible to prove that magic "does not exist"! `
`It's a "Devil's Proof"!!" `
`"At this point in time, this garden is the truth! `
`The instant you look inside, the tiny people inside the Braun tube will vanish. `
`And there are no traces of magic here at all! `
`So that battle between you witches "did not take place"!!" `
`"Wh- `
`What the... `
`Th-that counter...?! `
`That power, `
`...c-could it be...?!" `
`"...Have you forgotten, Milady? `
`It is the Multi-layered Worlds Reduction Technique. `
`The power of a Finite Witch, the counter to the power of an Endless Witch. `
`Only an Endless Witch can perceive it, and it is most effective against such a witch." `
`"Sch-Schrodinger's cat box?! `
`......Th-That old hag of a witch... What an uncalled-for hint!!" `
`"We've lost time. `
`Including the five servants and Grandfather, there are six corpses! `
`Let me check the scene. `
`I've been trudging along wasting time. `
`From now on, I'll speed things up, okay?" `
`"Take a seat, Beatrice!! `
`It's finally the first twilight, isn't it? Let's start the real thing. `
`Show me what you've got!!!" `
