`A monotonous electronic sound kept on repeating. `
`The room was colored with hygienic tones...in other words, an emotionless white. `
`...It was a room at a certain university hospital. `
`Neither her doctors nor the person herself had any doubts that this room, `
`which had a price so high that no commoner could afford to spend a single night there, would be the last room she ever saw... `
`Was the person on the bed... `
`...Eva? `
`Even if someone told you that was so, she was unbelievably aged and worn out. `
`The well-built man in a suit waiting in the corner near the door was having a whispered conversation through an intercom with someone outside. `
`...He was a guard protecting Eva's person. `
`After telling the person on the other end of the intercom to wait, he approached Eva's bed. `
`...Eva had been awake for a short while. `
`...However, she stared at a single point in empty space, as though her mind was not in the same place. `
`"...Ange ({p:0:縝寿})-san has arrived in the lobby below. `
`Should we let her pass?" `
`"............" `
`For a long time, Eva didn't answer. `
`However, bit by bit, her eyes began to regain their focus, and she gave a small nod, indicating that she didn't mind if they called Ange. `
`...It had been Eva who called her. `
`And she was right on time. `
`By this point, Eva would refuse anyone who wanted a meeting without an appointment. `
`The room was dark, even though it was still light outside, ...because the curtains were always closed. `
`...There was always one guard waiting in the room, and three more waiting in the corridor and the lobby. `
`They were all there to protect Eva's person... `
`Eventually, there was the sound of a knock. `
`Also, there was a message from the intercom that the guest's body check had been completed with no problems. `
`The door was unlocked, then opened, `
`......and a high school aged girl was standing there. `
`"Chairman, `
`Ange-san has arrived." `
`Eva reacted and turned her face towards the guest. `
`However, instead of reacting to the guard's call, maybe it would be better to say that she reacted to the smell of Ange's makeup. `
`...After being shut up in this room for so long, Eva was sensitive to even small changes in smell. `
`"............ `
`So you came, `
`...Ange." `
`"...I came. `
`You did call me." `
`On Eva's face, there was no trace of a person warmly welcoming their niece. `
`...And on Ange's face, you couldn't see the expression of one pleased to meet with their aunt. `
`Eva waved her arm, which had grown as thin as a withered branch, and motioned for the guard to leave. `
`The guard bowed silently and went out into the hall. `
`"...It's not only stuffy, but dark too. `
`Why don't you have the curtains opened...?" `
`"......Is your plan for that hit man you hired to shoot me through the window...?" `
`"......I wish I could get hired to assassinate you. `
`All I'd have to do is relax at home for a month and the job would take care of itself." `
`"...Heheheheh, hahhahhahhahha..." `
`Their discussion was quite morbid for an aunt and niece. `
`...However, they didn't look like they were joking. `
`...At the very least, Eva believed that someone was after her life. `
`All of the Ushiromiya family's massive fortune had come into the possession of Ushiromiya Eva. `
`...It was said that this fortune also included the 10 tons of hidden gold that Ushiromiya Kinzo was rumored to have hidden. `
`While this vast wealth lay in Eva's cunning, sly, and suspicious hands, no one was able to complain, `
`...but it was rumored that as soon as it was passed on to Ange, who was no more than a young girl, certain people were plotting to snatch it away. `
`By now, Eva and Ange were Kinzo's only descendants. `
`...If Eva died, all of the wealth would go to Ange. `
`...And if Ange were then to be killed as well, `
`...that wealth would go to the family of Ange's mother, Kyrie. `
`In this sense, not only Eva, but Ange as well, `
`...were in a position where it wouldn't be odd at all for their life to be targeted by some unknown person. `
`...And Eva had hated Ange for a long time. `
`This was because she knew that, after losing her only precious son, George, `
`...the inheritor of her own wealth would be none other than the girl who had been absent at that family conference 12 years ago, `
`and who had survived. `
`Eva shunned Ange, disliked her, and even hated her. `
`She isolated Ange in a special school and separated her from the youth and happiness normal people have, trying to keep her as a pet until death. `
`...However, Eva had succumbed to an incurable illness, `
`and ironically, ...her remaining life was estimated to be the same as Kinzo's had been at that family conference 12 years ago. `
`Both Eva and Ange...hated each other. `
`Even though they were each other's last blood relatives, ...they hated each other so much that they hoped the other would die quickly... `
`"......And? `
`Why did you go to all the trouble of calling for me...?" `
`"...I don't have much time left. `
`...These quack doctors still can't detect any of the poison that's filling me up. `
`......I know. `
`I'm sure it's some secret assassination drug used by those Soviet KGBs. `
`...Ooh, I'm gonna be killed, I'm gonna be killed...!! `
`Isn't that great?! Very soon, I will die, which will surely be quite a load off your back...!" `
`"............ `
`...What a pitiable person." `
`This always happened. `
`...They immediately deviated from the main topic, distorting it into a more unsettling discussion. `
`Eva, who was absolutely paranoid, believed that someone was always after her life. `
`And in actual fact, after inheriting the vast wealth of the Ushiromiya family, `
`she had used wild methods just like Kinzo had done in the past, repeatedly making money by any means necessary and creating many enemies along the way. `
`With a massive supply of capital, she had plotted to aggressively buy businesses that were starting to have rapid growth, `
`making them buy it back at a high price under the guise of reconciliation. `
`...Ironically, it was the same type of action that her husband's company had been hit with 12 years ago... `
`She had repeated this constantly for 12 years. `
`...She had also earned a lot of hatred. `
`If her husband had heard of this from beyond the grave, he might have defended her, saying that the loneliness from losing her family fueled her actions. `
`...However, of all the people who knew her now, none would defend her. `
`For some time, Eva eloquently spoke of how her life was being targeted, `
`listing off names of people who hated her, `
`and sneering at the fact that she still hadn't been killed. `
`Even though Ange heard her own name included in that list, `
`there was no particular change in her expression, and she waited indifferently for Eva to tire herself out... `
`"......You see, `
`...I really hate `
`you." `
`"I'm honored. `
`Same here." `
`"......I built this future for George's sake. `
`...To think that it would be snatched away by you. `
`...To think that it would be stolen away by Rudolf's daughter... `
`......I can't bear it. `
`......To think that not only will I not leave a child, `
`...without even leaving behind a child... `
`......That, `
`...I cannot forgive......!" `
`"...If only you'd just give all of your fortune to charity. `
`What about all those religious people you used to go so far out of your way to find?" `
`"......*cackle*cackle*! `
`They all say the same thing. `
`...My excessive wealth has become a burden to me. `
`And they always say something about how I need to give it up and cleanse myself. `
`...Ahhahahahahahahahaha! `
`Then I thought of something. `
`I stopped donating!" `
`For a time, Eva had searched for the founders of several strange and new religious cults, perhaps seeking peace in her heart. `
`...But they gave her heart no relief, `
`and if anything, they ended up increasing her paranoia further... `
`"......If you have too much money, why don't you start buying up thoroughbreds and make some corned beef?" `
`"I've thought of something even more interesting. `
`...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*! `
`I've worried over it a lot. `
`What could I do to make things horrible for you?" `
`"...I thought about killing you. `
`I also thought about erasing all of my wealth, leaving you penniless, and selling you off to a slave trader or something. `
`Wouldn't that be wonderful? `
`You'd have your arms and legs chopped off and be forced to take customers until you died. `
`Aaah, that would be so wonderful, `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!" `
`"......Is this fun for you?" `
`"Oh yes, it is. `
`It's fun to scare you, `
`...but very soon, I will die. `
`...So I thought about how I might continue to cause you pain even after my death. `
`......And then, ...*cackle*cackle*!! `
`It was surprisingly simple. `
`...I called you because I wanted to talk about it." `
`".........I have midterms coming up. `
`Keep it brief." `
`"...I have decided. `
`I will have you inherit all of my fortune." `
`"............ `
`...Oh?" `
`"Not only that, `
`...but I decided that until the very day I die, `
`...I'll expand that fortune as much as I can, inflating it to massive proportions before having you inherit all of it. `
`...*cackle*cackle* Can you even imagine what that would be like...?" `
`"...I don't get it. `
`Because it's stupid." `
`"Ehhehhehheh, *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!! `
`That's right, you don't get it, do you...?! `
`Look forward to it, it really is fun, being rich...! `
`Every day, youkai from across Japan come to play." `
`"From now on, your entire life will be followed by talk shows and weekly magazines. `
`The media will criticize me no matter what I do or don't do! `
`If I donate, they'll attack me for being bourgeois, and if I hesitate, I'll be abused as a miser. `
`Oh, every day really is wonderful, you see? `
`I decided it'd be great let you have that kind of life, when you're so young and have so much ahead of you. `
`Doesn't that sound absolutely wonderful?" `
`"......Looks like the public's opinion of all you've done was spot on." `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!! `
`Too true, yes, that is too true. `
`...Go ahead, abuse me as much as you want. `
`Soon, you will face that same criticism. `
`...Japanese culture dictates that good people live in honorable poverty, while the wealthy should just die. `
`No matter what you do or do not do, you will eventually be lifted up as a symbol of envy and hate across Japan. `
`...*cackle*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"I wonder how twisted your life will become after living that way... `
`You have no allies! `
`No one will listen to your worries. `
`Abusing you will become a public sport. `
`And no one can stop that!" `
`"Oh, Ange! `
`Ehheheheheheh, `
`oh, I'm really looking forward to it. `
`...I wonder how you will live your life...and how you'll end it...! `
`Enjoy to the fullest a life of being unable to trust anyone in the world, being unable to love anyone, being unable to talk with anyone...!! `
`I'll be patiently waiting for you to take that story of hardship down with you into hell. `
`Heheheheh, `
`ahahhahahahahahahaha, `
`wa-hhahhahhahhahhahhhahahahahahahahahahhahha, `
`gkk, `
`*cough*cough*, `
`ghah!!" `
`Her insane laughter turned into a painful cough. `
`Without changing her expression in the slightest, looking completely unconcerned, `
`...Ange stared at the only survivor of Rokkenjima. `
`Perhaps because he found the violent coughing suspicious, the guard gave a short knock on the door and rushed in at the same time. `
`Ange glanced at him, wordlessly making it clear that she didn't intend to move a step from where she was. `
`...Ange was prepared for some kind of trap to frame her in Eva's death. `
`However, that was fortunately a needless fear. `
`As the guard rubbed Eva's back, he poured hot water from a thermos into a mug. `
`As he did, Eva kept coughing, apparently in pain. `
`Ange figured that this was probably the last she'd see of the Rokkenjima Witch's final days. `
`Eventually, the coughing subsided, and Eva regained her normal breathing. `
`...However, the glittering madness inside her eyes hadn't subsided in the slightest. `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!! `
`Now, I will give to you... `
`that cursed mass of gold and the Ushiromiya Family Headship, `
`...as well as... `
`...the name of the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`......Enjoy the insane, twisted rest of your life, fitting for the name of the witch...!" `
`"I don't need that. `
`More importantly, tell me. `
`...On that day, what happened on Rokkenjima? `
`......I don't believe it was an accident. `
`Tell me the truth about what happened that day, and why Father and Mother and Nii-san died...!!" `
`"*cackle*cackle*...! `
`Oh, yes, that is the best way I have to harass you, isn't it? `
`...What happened on that day? `
`What happened on this day in 1986...? `
`...You want to know what they said before they died, riiight...?" `
`"I won't tell yoooooouu, `
`aaahhhyahhyahhyahhyah!! `
`I'll leave behind the cursed gold! `
`But you know what? I'll take the truth you seek with me to hell...! `
`That's the best way I can torment you!!" `
`"Oh, are you mad? `
`If you want to hear it so much, try going to hell and asking your family there! `
`In that case, you'd better die right now, right?! `
`Ahhahahahahaha, if only you'd just give up and die right now!! `
`Waaahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!" `
`That laugh continued until she started coughing again. `
`And that cough did not subside until she started moaning and going into convulsions... `
`October 4, 1986. `
`On Rokkenjima, the Ushiromiya family's customary...and final family conference was held. `
`And on the next day, October 5... `
`"An extremely unfortunate accident" occurred, and the Ushiromiya family was wiped out. `
`"Fortunately", Ushiromiya Eva escaped from that... `
`and inherited almost all of the Ushiromiya family's fortune. `
`However, due to the many turbulent rumors surrounding the Ushiromiya family, the way Eva acted afterwards, `
`and her unnatural actions "at the time of the unfortunate accident", the public was in an uproar over whether this might have been a conspiracy to get all of the inheritance for herself. `
`Under pressure from the public, prosecutors repeatedly tried to investigate the matter, `
`and the media began tracing the outline of a conspiracy they called the Rokkenjima Suspicion, `
`but in the end, they weren't even able to find proof that this "unfortunate accident" was a crime. `
`However, because the media continued to give the impression that the Rokkenjima Suspicion was a conspiracy of Eva's, `
`public opinion began to believe that she was the true culprit. `
`...Of course, that was also influenced by the bad impression caused by all that easily-condemnable, overbearing financial activity, `
`which she had carried out using that vast wealth. `
`Every time she did something and the rumors started spreading, the media would bring back the Rokkenjima Suspicion, `
`blaming the criminal justice system by saying that she was the true culprit, and that the only reason she hadn't been arrested was because even the police had been bribed. `
`So the impression that she was a great villain grew stronger and stronger... `
`Her heart eventually degenerated, `
`...and ironically, it began to transfigure her into the kind of human that the public expected... `
`By now, Eva had no one she could trust...and no family. `
`...After her beloved husband passed away, the talk shows occasionally mentioned his company, `
`saying that it was run recklessly, while criticizing and disgracing its former accomplishments. `
`Even her beloved son, George, `
`was dramatized as the stereotypical "rich, lazy son" that the public expected, `
`...and no one even wanted to know what a simple and honest character he had possessed. `
`...As to how much all of this hurt Eva and ran her to ruin, ...no one cared. `
`The public was only interested out of curiosity... `
`about how a super-rich evil woman who killed her whole family lived her pitiful later years. `
`So that happened more and more, `
`...and eventually... `
`...Eva's personality was transfigured until people started calling her a lunatic... `
`It was said that this sometimes reminded her of her father, whom she had once admired, in his later years, `
`and that she laughed at herself with scorn... `
`And, on the day of that final family conference... `
`Because Ushiromiya Rudolf's daughter, Ange, had been sick and had stayed with her mother's family, she had not participated. `
`At the age of 6, she had lost her family and had gained Eva as her guardian. `
`Since Ange had become Eva's only blood relative, `
`Eva "took very good care of her". `
`She had imposing guards surrounding Ange's person at all times, to prevent her from coming to harm. `
`...Ange had even her right to play with friends, to come home from school together, and to enjoy the seasons together...stolen away. `
`"So that she can live a full and pleasant school life", `
`Eva had sent Ange to an elegant boarding school that took care of her every need, completely isolating her from the world. `
`She didn't even know the popular songs that girls her age might hum. `
`She was never given a chance to enjoy window shopping with her friends or stuffing her mouth with crepes, `
`...much less an encounter with a member of the opposite sex to make her heart throb. `
`Ange did not have a single friend. `
`If anyone carelessly acted friendly with Ange, they would be scolded by the guards, or else the teachers. `
`...All of them were strictly ordered not to let shabby humans approach the daughter of the esteemed Ushiromiya family. `
`During that time, the talk shows were always mentioning Ushiromiya Eva, always spreading rumors about her countless financial misdeeds. `
`...Those who knew who her "daughter" was naturally began to keep their distance. `
`...Even now, she was called a witch at school, and anytime something bad happened, `
`even if there was no proof, it would be whispered--whispered as though if were absolute truth--that she had imposed her will on the school staff. `
`The environment makes the person. `
`By now, she had a heart as wild as those around her feared. `
`...No one trusted her, so she never bothered to believe in anyone. `
`No one loved her, so she never even tried to love. `
`And when Eva caught an incurable illness on top of all this, `
`it was whispered that this too was a conspiracy, and this time, Ange was set up as the mastermind... `
`Everyone whispered that the daughters of witches are witches too. `
`Even the talk shows and the weekly magazines whispered that. `
`...So Ange, too, `
`accepted it as though it was definitely... `
`no, `
`as though it was obviously true. `
`Therefore, since she already believed that she was a witch, `
`when she heard that the name of the Golden Witch was being turned over to her, she only felt like saying "You just figured that out now?" `
`However, she was at least sure of one thing. `
`This title of witch that she had inherited...would definitely never be inherited by anyone else. `
`She would be the last Head of the Ushiromiya Family, and the last lonely...Golden Witch... `
`Ange could be seen on the roof of a skyscraper. `
`Compared to the winds of the world that had beaten down upon her until now, this strong, cold wind was warm and pleasant. `
`Below her lay a beautiful nighttime scene, and a dazzling river of red and white lights. `
`It was supposed to be clear out that night. `
`...So there really should have been countless stars stretching out over the sky. `
`...However, the light from the ground was too bright, so you couldn't see them at all. `
`...Ange couldn't help but think that what she truly sought must lie in that unseen starlight. `
`The world of reality below her looked so far away from here. `
`...She could imagine that this place was the closest to the world she really should be in. `
`......There was only one thing that Ange cursed. `
`Why had she not been able to go to that family conference, on that day 12 years ago? `
`Even though, if she had gone, it would probably have been possible for her to stay with her family forever. `
`...Lately, ...she'd been dreaming about her family over and over again. `
`The person I was 12 years ago calls out frantically, urging them not to go to the family conference. `
`But both Dad and Mom are too far away, and my hand won't reach them. `
`Battler nii-san always loved me a lot, and he'd always pat my head, `
`......but even though it looks like that hand's about to touch me, even it does not reach. `
`For some reason, I started having that dream over and over. `
`...Every time I had that the same dream, `
`I uselessly tried to stretch out my hand even more forcefully, over and over and over. `
`Even if only Battler nii-san had lived... `
`......Then, perhaps, we'd at least be able to support each other in my cold and lonely reality. `
`But his hand never reaches me. `
`Even if I climb to the roof of this tall building, `
`...I'm so far away from all of them. `
`...A mysterious girl appears in my dreams and urges me. `
`She urges me to find the truth of what happened 12 years ago. `
`"............ `
`...If only I could learn... `
`...everything that happened to Father and the rest of them on that day, `
`......would they come back? `
`At least one of them...?!" `
`There was no way... `
`that anyone would answer that question for her. `
`I get it. `
`......In this world, I have no family or friends. `
`So, `
`......let's go. `
`...Let's go home. `
`...To where my family is. `
`From the start, ...Ange's figure had been on the outer side of the fence. `
`The scenery below her eyes was distant, beautiful, and so fantastical that it actually didn't give rise to fear. `
`If I look down, I'll surely be swallowed up by the world below. `
`...So I looked up. `
`Because I wanted to be taken to the world above, the world where my family was. `
`......Who cares about vast wealth? `
`Who cares about cursed gold? `
`Who cares about the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}? `
`What I really want, even a mountain of gold couldn't get me... `
`What I need for that...is to take a single step forward, ...just that little bit of courage. `
`......At that moment, `
`...I definitely heard a voice. `
`It was a voice I knew. `
`A voice that had...called to me in my dreams for so long... `
`Before my eyes...in other words, in mid-air above that jet black nighttime scenery... `
`...There was the figure of the girl I'd seen in my dreams... `
`She spoke again, with the same voice I'd heard in those dreams. `
`"......Your assistance is required." `
`"...My... `
`...assistance...? `
`Who needs it...?" `
`"......Your family needs it. `
`...Your family has been eternally imprisoned in the span from this day 12 years ago until the following day." `
`"I-If I save them, `
`...does that mean my family will come home?!" `
`When I asked the question I had most wanted to, the girl cruelly stopped talking and hung her head. `
`"...I cannot promise that. `
`The enemy is the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`...A mighty opponent. `
`I cannot oppose her. `
`...But, another Golden Witch might be able to manage something." `
`"......I-I don't know...what you're talking about." `
`"...The only one who can oppose the {f:5:Beatrice} of 1986... `
`is the final {f:5:Beatrice} of 1998. `
`......In other words, you. `
`Ange. `
`.........{f:5:Ange Beatrice}." `
`"That witch from 12 years ago... `
`...took away my family......?" `
`"That's right. `
`She is your foe. `
`......The root cause that always leads to your future of isolation." `
`"............ `
`......My... `
`...family's... `
`...foe." `
`"...In exchange, I will search for a Fragment with the ideal world that you wish for, a world where your family comes home. `
`......I make no promises that your desire will be granted. `
`...{f:5:Beatrice}'s game board in 1986 is quite perfect." `
`"...I had planned on bringing you that ideal Fragment as a present today, but I still can't find it. `
`......This is a very firm fate. `
`I haven't seen the likes of it since the time I fought {f:5:Lambdadelta}." `
`"..................... `
`I- `
`I don't know... `
`what you're talking about." `
`"......I'm giving you a chance for revenge. `
`...In exchange, I promise to search for and bring you the happiest resolution among the possibilities you're capable of accepting." `
`"............Revenge..." `
`"...It may be a fruitless effort. `
`Even if you succeed in your revenge, there's no definite proof that your family will return. `
`Even if you manage to hit a miraculous probability, you may only be able to bring one person back, if that." `
`...Ange understood the meaning of that dream. `
`...The dream where it seemed that, with just a little more stretching, her hand might be able to reach at least Battler nii-san. `
`"A miraculous probability...means it's still higher than zero, right...? `
`Is it 1%...?" `
`"...Trying to read any probabilities before the result is useless. `
`So I cannot tell you that number." `
`"But it'll definitely be slightly more likely than if I do nothing." `
`"Yes. `
`As long as you do not throw that desire of yours away. `
`But be prepared. `
`It is extremely close to zero." `
`"......... `
`Okay. `
`I'll take you up on that offer." `
`"...Are you sure? `
`You probably won't be able to return here again." `
`"This isn't the world I'm supposed to be in. `
`...I'll find the world I am supposed to be in myself. `
`Tell me your name." `
`"The Witch of Miracles, {f:5:Bernkastel}. `
`And by that name, `
`I acknowledge you as the Golden Witch, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}. `
`...As of now, you are a true witch." `
`The instant she proclaimed that I was a witch... `
`...I felt dizzy, as though something inside me had changed drastically. `
`At that time, I heard a *clunk*. `
`...It was the sound of the door that opened to the staircase to the roof. `
`It was Aunt Eva's guards. `
`...They're only "guards" in name. Aren't they the cage that wraps the tightest around me, shutting me in? `
`They saw that I was already on the other side of the fence and dashed forward, horrified. `
`"20, we've found the target. `
`Requesting backup on the roof." `
`"Ange-san...! `
`We were looking for you! `
`It's dangerous there, so quickly, come this way!" `
`"......What's that?" `
`"...My fan club. `
`...I'm pretty popular." `
`"No point in getting caught. `
`......Let's go." `
`Looking annoyed, {f:5:Bernkastel} turned on her heels. `
`...In the jet black sky. `
`Watching that perfectly casual gesture, I followed her as though it was completely normal. `
`"Ange-san!!! `
`Wait! `
`Don't be hasty, look ooooooooooouuuut!!" `
`"Aaah, it's useless, it's all useless. `
`Well then, <see you again> next time. `
`Please send a limo to get me. `
`'Cause everyone else will be there too. `
`See you." `
