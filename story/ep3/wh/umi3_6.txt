`"............Well then, `
`how will this game be resolved? `
`...You may submit, or you may resist. `
`...Either way, it will truly be an entertaining banquet worth betting my short remaining life on." `
`In his dimly lit study, occasionally brightened by lightning, `
`Kinzo kept mumbling and laughing to himself. `
`On the antique clock with the intricate design that had been sitting on his desk, `
`the two overlapping hands tilted to the right and began to slide. `
`The measure of time that counted up to 24...had returned to 0...and had begun to count back again... `
`"...Measuring time is a brutal thing. `
`It drags itself all the way to 24 over the course of a day, and then returns back to 0. `
`...It certainly did count to 23:59. `
`However, is it ever able to reach 24:00? `
`...If you conclude that it returns to 0:00 again without reaching 24, how futile it must all be." `
`But perhaps a person's life is the same. `
`You live, aiming for a perfect 24, and in the instant you reach it, you return to 0. `
`People will probably praise the departed, saying that he did reach 24, but he most certainly did not. `
`......In the end, he's a 0. `
`"I am different. `
`...I will live and reach 24. `
`That itself is the Golden Land. `
`...For that is where {f:5:Beatrice} dwells." `
`Kinzo had been fumbling around with some tarot cards for some time. `
`It looked as though he was trying to divine his own luck with a contest, doing it over every time he didn't like the result. `
`The most forbidden action in tarot reading is trying to predict the same thing twice. `
`To do so ridicules the results of fortune telling... `
`and also desecrates those beings higher than humans that give revelations through the tarot cards. `
`However, Kinzo knew. `
`Tarot cards shouldn't be used twice because...since they're nothing more than a random number generator, `
`reading them twice will naturally cause a different result to appear. `
`...Therefore, reading them twice was only forbidden to preserve the mystique of the tarot cards' results. `
`...However, that didn't mean that Kinzo didn't take tarot reading seriously. `
`Kinzo's interpretation of tarot reading was done in a completely different way. `
`That was to repeat the reading, over and over, `
`without giving up in the slightest, until he reached the result most favorable to him. `
`The mark he set for this "most favorable result" would vary, `
`but when he demanded the most favorable result in a strictly literal sense, `
`it was the same as a simple roulette of luck, where he seeked an arithmetic miracle. `
`...However, Kinzo used miracles of numbers as the basis of his magical power, so this functioned perfectly well as a magical ritual. `
`In other words, `
`until the result he desired appeared perfectly, he would strive to repeat the tarot readings over and over, with conviction, turning the feelings of his heart into prayers, `
`so that when they reached the heavens, they would be sublimated into results. This was Kinzo's personal magical interpretation. `
`Therefore, even though Kinzo's tarot cards were no different from those generally used, `
`the way in which they were used was completely different... `
`"......... `
`...Tonight...will not go as I thought." `
`Kinzo stopped his hands for a second. `
`...He seemed not to be getting the results he wanted. `
`On the contrary, bad cards that shouldn't show up so often appeared repeatedly... `
`and continued to interfere with the miracle Kinzo wished for. `
`".........Hmph. `
`...Is that how it is?" `
`Kinzo seemed to have received some revelation that was different from normal. `
`But, judging by the unlucky cards scattered across his desk, it was difficult to imagine that the omen had been a good one... `
`For a while, Kinzo closed his eyes tightly, pondering something. `
`Then, as the thunder roared, he made up his mind about something, took the telephone receiver, and dialed. `
`"......It is I. `
`Is Genji there? An urgent matter has come up." `
`"......Haah." `
`In front of the entrance hall, Shannon's once burning face had been cooled off by the frigid air. `
`...She had thought... `
`that George's proposal would surely come sooner or later. `
`It wasn't as though she hadn't prepared herself mentally. `
`And she had answered by nodding. `
`Had she been reckless because of her youth? `
`Should she have thought about her future more seriously? `
`I wonder if my immediate reply made him think I'm a cheap girl. `
`...If I'd at least waited until tomorrow morning, would that at least have shown him I was taking this seriously? `
`Now that she'd already received the ring from George, Shannon kept fidgeting in embarrassment. `
`I should've done this, I should've done that. `
`As she did, she heard the sound of footsteps splashing through puddles. `
`Shannon immediately chased away the emotions welling up inside her. `
`"...Genji-sama? `
`And Kanon-kun too...! `
`I-I'm sorry, I have to go back soon, umm..." `
`She grew stiff, thinking she'd surely be scolded for spending too much time in her secret lover's meeting with George. `
`"Shannon, `
`the Master told us to come to the study, saying it was urgent. `
`Let us hurry." `
`"...Huh? `
`Y-Yes, certainly...! `
`What in the world...?" `
`"He said he had a premonition of misfortune. `
`...How convenient for him, considering he's the one who started this ceremony." `
`"We will enter from the back, so that Gohda doesn't notice us. `
`Hide your footsteps." `
`"Yes. `
`......Nee-san, take care. `
`You're so noisy." `
`Kanon was especially good at hiding his footsteps. `
`...Just like a cat. `
`He was able to suddenly be there without anyone noticing and leave in the same way. `
`For example, even though he stepped in puddles, `
`the sound he made was far smaller than that of the rain hitting them... `
`Genji also had abilities of that kind. `
`...Or rather, those servants called furniture were supposed to be like that. `
`Just like how desks and closets go unnoticed by members of the family, `
`these servants also held it as a great virtue to just suddenly be there whenever they were needed. `
`Compared to that, Shannon's footsteps still strongly asserted themselves. `
`...She was also trying to hide her footsteps, `
`but compared to Kanon and Genji...well, you could say she was a little more boisterous... `
`Eventually, they reached the back door, and the three of them entered the mansion. `
`Immediately, ......they thought they felt something. `
`It was different from a sense of smell, ...and it seemed to hit the depths of their noses. `
`...This hard-to-describe sensation, which you might call a sixth sense, allowed them to perceive that something was different than usual. `
`"......Genji-sama." `
`"...Indeed. Let us hurry." `
`That sensation made it feel as though a tense something was pressing in around them. `
`Realizing that, the three of them dashed up the stairs, heading for Kinzo's study while still hiding their footsteps. `
`When they dashed up the stairs, ...that smell of sweet poison particular to Kinzo's study reached their noses. `
`".........Nn." `
`"What is it, Genji-sama...?" `
`"...The barrier...is dead." `
`"Huh? `
`.........Ah." `
`After hearing Kanon's words, she looked at the door to the study. `
`A scorpion pattern was engraved on the doorknob. `
`A powerful ward against magic. `
`The final barrier, which protected Kinzo himself. `
`It had been broken. `
`Of course, there was no change to the doorknob that the eye could see. `
`However, those who could understand things people couldn't perceive...were able to recognize that a dramatic change had occurred... `
`"...Master. `
`Master...! `
`It is Genji. `
`Please open the door." `
`Genji called in this way after knocking several times, but there was no answer from the study. `
`"Shannon, guard our backs. `
`Kanon, search inside the room." `
`""Yes...!"" `
`Kanon put his ear against the door, searching for a presence inside the study. `
`To protect the backs of the pair watching the door, Shannon faced the other way, ready for the unexpected. `
`"......The Master must be in here. `
`...But it's too quiet." `
`"Do you mean to say he's safe?" `
`"No. `
`{i:It's too quiet}." `
`"...Could it......possibly be..." `
`"Master, `
`excuse us about the door." `
`Genji pulled a gold key out of his pocket. `
`It was the only key to the study that existed, other than the one Kinzo held. `
`He stuck it in the key hole and turned it heavily. `
`...At first glance, that seemed to prove that it was a sturdy lock. `
`However, now that the barrier had been destroyed, `
`this door might as well have been left open, from the viewpoint of anyone with magical power. `
`The heavy sound just now meant that the door had now been opened {i:even for humans}. `
`"...Excuse me." `
`As Genji respectfully bowed his head, `
`and Kanon's sense of tension grew tighter, `
`and Shannon trembled, they entered the study... `
`They immediately discovered Kinzo's figure. `
`...He was sitting on the reception sofa so that his back faced them. `
`Genji noticed the person sitting across from him, and again bowed deeply. `
`Kanon also noticed that person, `
`...but he didn't bow his head. `
`He stood in front of Shannon and spread out his arms, blocking the way to her. `
`So without even seeing that person's face, Shannon already had a good idea who it was... `
`"...So, you have come, `
`{f:5:Beatrice}-sama." `
`"Genji, is it? `
`You came very quickly. `
`Yes, it is always best when furniture answers to their master's call quickly. `
`Unlike this person." `
`"...... `
`...So, Ronove-sama has come as well." `
`Genji directed his greeting towards the thin darkness behind and to the right of {f:5:Beatrice}, where there shouldn't have been anything. `
`Even Kanon and Shannon would never have imagined that someone was there. `
`...However, the darkness responded immediately and praised Genji's eyesight... `
`"As usual, you don't disappoint. `
`It has been quite some time. `
`......Still, you've grown old, haven't you? `
`Have so many years truly passed you by?" `
`"My days have been full and satisfying. `
`...It appears you have been living quite a full life yourself, Ronove-sama." `
`"Yes. `
`Thank you. `
`......And Shannon, it has been a long time since I last saw you as well. `
`You have grown quite beautiful. `
`And, it seems that you have grown quite strong. `
`That is fortunate." `
`"......Thank you very much." `
`"...Nee-san, who in the world..." `
`"This will be our first meeting, Kanon-kun. `
`...I, Ronove, have been entrusted with the position of {f:5:Beatrice}-sama's head furniture. `
`...I am an old friend of Genji-san's, `
`and I am also furniture, just like you. `
`Although the master I serve is different." `
`The tense color didn't disappear from Kanon's face in the slightest. `
`...Depending on the master furniture served, they might be kind or brutal or anything else. `
`...If this person claimed to be furniture serving the hated {f:5:Beatrice}, `
`then he must be despicable as well... `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`It seems I'm thoroughly despised. `
`It's as though you hate everything that has anything to do with me." `
`{f:5:Beatrice} openly sneered at Kanon's hate-filled face... `
`Then, Kanon finally realized. `
`{f:5:Beatrice} and Kinzo were having a chess game across the reception table. `
`But Kinzo hadn't even quivered. `
`He was holding his head with both hands, his eyes closed tight, ...as he contemplated his next move. `
`...Or was he in anguish...? `
`"......Master......" `
`"I have told Kinzo two things. `
`There was good news and bad news. `
`...The good news is that he'll have the good fortune of being reunited with me before the ceremony ends. `
`The bad news is that Kinzo has been selected as the very first sacrifice in the ceremony." `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`There's absolutely nothing I can do about it. `
`Because it truly was decided by the fickle roulette." `
`"...L-Liar. `
`We know you're just a murderer who kills for fun..." `
`"Stop it, Kanon-kun..." `
`"...So, Kinzo, `
`isn't it about time you decided to accept your loss? `
`...*cackle* With this, our long contest is at an end, yes?" `
`"............" `
`At a glance, it was hard to make out the situation on that chaotic chessboard. `
`...However, judging by Kinzo's anguish and {f:5:Beatrice}'s malicious confidence, `
`it seemed to be over already... `
`"......It is unavoidable... `
`...Perhaps even this could be amusing." `
`"It is to me too. `
`...Resolving my contest with you may bring a flood of emotions, but it has already surpassed love and hate. `
`...It was fun. `
`These past few decades certainly weren't boring...!" `
`{f:5:Beatrice} advanced her queen...and made her final move. `
`...And that... `
`decided it. `
`"Checkmate. `
`......This is my final tribute to you. `
`Without any reservations, `
`...sleep." `
`"Heheheh, `
`...fuhahaha, `
`haah `
`hah `
`hah `
`hah `
`hah `
`hah `
`hah!!" `
`Kinzo suddenly stood up and laughed, like an opera singer facing a full crowd and spreading his arms, `
`...as though he had succeeded in a century-long plan. `
`That laugh... `
`...spat crimson. `
`Crimson flames poured out from inside him, `
`spitting even out of his mouth, ears, and nose, and all at once, his body was wrapped in hellfire... `
`But Kinzo kept laughing. `
`The more he laughed, the more the hellfire spewed from his entire body and began to char him... `
`Those flames became a brilliant light, `
`which dazzlingly shone on the various magic tools throughout the room, making their distorted shadows dance across the walls. `
`...Those shadows looked like the dead in hell, watching over Kinzo in ecstasy as he burned... `
`And, `
`for one who had made a contract with the witch, `
`it was an extremely fitting end... `
`...in accordance with those terms... `
`After laughing and howling in the roaring flames for a some time, `
`Kinzo flopped to the ground, as though he was a puppet whose strings had been cut. `
`Those incredible blazing flames disappeared as though he'd been completely burned up, `
`and afterwards, nothing remained but a festering and burnt corpse that one could hardly bear to look at... `
`".........Horrible..." `
`"Hmph. `
`You should talk. `
`As if you didn't think that was a fitting way for him to die..." `
`"...Why have you shown yourself...? `
`Do you have some business with us...?" `
`"Stop it, Kanon-kun. `
`...You mustn't provoke {f:5:Beatrice}-sama." `
`"It would seem you have them absolutely terrified. `
`Pu ku ku ku." `
`"I imagine I'll never get along with Kanon. `
`Hey, it's not as though I dislike you particularly..." `
`{f:5:Beatrice} grinned. `
`Kanon violently averted his gaze, obviously unhappy. `
`...His reaction was so different from what he wanted to do that it made the witch and her butler laugh. `
`"Kanon, `
`...you stand in the presence of {f:5:Beatrice}-sama. `
`Carefully consider your manner of speech." `
`"Oh, I care not, Genji. `
`Let him say what he pleases. `
`I am gracious." `
`"...How are you gracious...?!" `
`"I am always gracious to those who are about to die. `
`*cackle*cackle*...!" `
`Kanon was taken aback by that creepy laughter... `
`{f:5:Beatrice} wasn't here just to take Kinzo's life. `
`The first twilight required six sacrifices. `
`Kinzo alone wasn't nearly enough. `
`...And they'd just casually walked in here... `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*! `
`Fear not, Kanon. `
`...It isn't as though you'll be selected as sacrifices just because you came here. `
`...After all, you were called here because you'd been selected already...!" `
`"......What......?!" `
`Their instincts were good enough to spot her meaning instantly... `
`Six sacrifices were required for the first twilight. `
`After Kinzo, how many more would you need to add up to six? `
`...In this mansion, the number five instantly made them think of the number of servants here... `
`"......Is that...what you desire?" `
`"Indeed. `
`...Thank me, furniture. `
`Tonight, your days of suffering will finally end. `
`You ought to thank me for coming here to tell you this." `
`"......Certainly. `
`If that is your desire." `
`"...G- `
`Genji-sama..." `
`Genji had agreed to the witch's heartless announcement with his usual demeanor, without raising an eyebrow. `
`"Now that the Master is dead, {f:5:Beatrice}-sama is our master. `
`Responding to her demands shall be our final duty." `
`"...Shannon. `
`Kanon. `
`You have done well serving until today. `
`That hard work is now over." `
`"...As I expected of you, Genji. `
`As your fellow furniture, I'm proud to have known you." `
`"Shannon, `
`...do you have any objections?" `
`"...No." `
`"......I heard that George-sama gave you a ring. `
`Do you still say...that you have no regrets?" `
`"Yes. `
`...That blessing was more than furniture deserves. `
`...Just receiving the ring has already satisfied my feelings." `
`Shannon couldn't take quite as much of a philosophical view as Genji. `
`There probably were regrets left in her heart. `
`...She probably wanted to spend a little more warm time with the person she cared for, George. `
`...But she released herself from that. `
`She took a single deep breath...and a blank expression rose to her face. `
`"......Very well." `
`"It does surprise me a tad to find that you've gained such composure, Shannon. `
`It seems you too have taken a philosophical view as furniture." `
`"Won't you at least shed some bitter tears for not being able to spend a night with the man you love? `
`What a boring woman." `
`"...... `
`This feeling cannot be understood by the likes of you, {f:5:Beatrice}-sama. `
`...If you desire our lives, please accept them. `
`We will solemnly carry out that duty." `
`"...Very well. `
`Excellently put..." `
`"Pu ku ku ku. `
`Just the type of person {f:5:Beatrice}-sama can't handle." `
`"She's been taking such a far-sighted view of things lately. `
`I must've tormented her too much last time. `
`Speaking of which, didn't I do the same to Battler? `
`...Hmmm. `
`Am I still soft? `
`Or is the way I corner them lacking? `
`In any case, she's just no fun." `
`"......However, it seems you will still entertain me, right? `
`Kanooon?" `
`"......Kanon-kun..." `
`"........." `
`Compared to the two who had taken a far-sighted approach, ...there was a painful anguish on Kanon's face. `
`Kanon was still far too young to accept his demise `
`after being told of it by a suddenly appearing witch... `
`"...Kanon. `
`I hate boredom more than anything. `
`And the fact that the other two have obediently accepted their deaths isn't amusing at all. `
`...So, I hope you don't betray my expectations." `
`"......Are you trying to make me your plaything...?" `
`Kanon realized that he was being provoked. `
`...However, no matter how furiously anger spurred him on, his opponent was a witch. `
`He was furniture. `
`He hadn't had a chance of victory from the beginning. `
`But the witch was expecting that he'd struggle in vain and writhe around, `
`and was even looking forward to it... `
`...Just thinking about that was frustrating enough to get his blood boiling. `
`Was disappointing the witch by refusing to resist, like the other two, `
`the only way he could strike back at her...? `
`"Eldest of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, Lucifer. `
`Arise." `
`"...Lucifer of Pride, right here." `
`"Kanon, `
`it would be far too cruel to force furniture to fight a witch. `
`No matter how much anger spurs you on, you would have no hope in a battle without a chance of success. `
`Of course, such a battle would be boring for me as well." `
`"...So, let it be furniture against furniture. `
`Why not resolve it with a battle between you two? `
`That should be enough to allow you some hope for victory, right...?" `
`"......... `
`...Forgive me, {f:5:Beatrice}-sama, `
`but how could I be inferior to this good-for-nothing furniture? `
`As if this cutie would have any chance against me... `
`Heheheheheheheheheheheheh." `
`"............Nng." `
`"Prove that you can defeat my furniture, the Seven Stakes of Purgatory. `
`If you manage to win through, `
`......let us see. `
`I will let you select the five who will escape becoming one of the 13 sacrifices. `
`I will welcome the five you recommend into the Golden Land without any conditions. `
`...How about that?" `
`Kanon understood that he was being provoked. `
`...However, the witch's offer was very tempting. `
`By this point, `
`Kanon couldn't care less about this evil ceremony the witch and the rest were trying to carry out. `
`...On the contrary, it was much more important that he remain alive so that he could be invited to the Golden Land... `
`and have his wish granted by {f:5:Beatrice} there... `
`"You cried, saying you'd had enough of being furniture, right...? `
`I shall grant your desire. `
`I shall give you that human body you wanted so much, you cried yourself to sleep. `
`What do you say...? `
`That way, you and Jessica could be together, yes? `
`Ooh, just perfect. `
`You may recommend that Jessica and yourself be invited to the Golden Land." `
`"...If you alone finding happiness isn't a satisfying solution for you, `
`then you can add in Shannon and George, the one she loves... `
`If you're worried about duty, then you can also add Genji. `
`Hoh! `
`That's five people. `
`Isn't that enough, Kanon? `
`......With this much of a reward, ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*! `
`...You won't let me get bored, will you...?" `
`"...She's just playing with you. `
`There is no need to listen to her." `
`"...I-I don't like it. `
`Are you okay with this, Nee-san?!" `
`{f:5:Beatrice} couldn't hide her evil smile at those words. `
`"I don't like it. `
`I want to be happy! `
`I've had enough of being furniture. `
`I want to become human...and have normal love...! `
`I want to know that...the ocean is blue, like you!" `
`"......How young. `
`I'm jealous." `
`"That's why I like the young ones. `
`...Genji, Shannon, stay back. `
`Kanon, Lucifer, forward." `
`"As you command." `
`"............" `
`"...Hehheheheheheheheheheheh. `
`I don't like it. `
`...That way you look down on me, `
`as if {f:5:Beatrice}-sama would be impossible, but with me at least you'd have a chance. `
`...I really don't like it." `
`That was probably humiliating for Lucifer. `
`...But at the same time, she was also happy...that she was lucky enough to have this adorable prey all to herself... `
`"......Come, furniture of the witch. `
`......Don't think that you can look down on me forever...!" `
`"So, Battler. `
`Isn't this a fun show? `
`*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"......Dammit. `
`Another weird thing's happening... `
`Like I'd ever believe in a magic battle...!" `
`"Look, look, don't turn your eyes away, look at it. `
`Look, look, look! `
`It's magic, it's furniture, `
`no matter how much you try to deny me and magic, `
`look, look, look, look, look!" `
`"If you've got all this happening right in front of you, it'd be a waste to miss it, don't you thiiiiiink? `
`Look, look, look, `
`just stop thinking, `
`magic exists! `
`This is fantasy! `
`Don't close your eyes, `
`look closely, `
`look, look, look, look!!" `
`"Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit... `
`I won't accept witches, I won't accept magic...! `
`But, if it's being done right in the open like that, what am I supposed to say?! `
`......Damn, dammiiiiit!" `
`"Come now, don't turn away, look closely, okaaaaaay?? `
`Magic exists, this is fantasy, so stop playing detective. `
`I know your secret, you actually don't really like to think things through, right?? `
`Then just stop, stoooop, *cackle*cackle*! `
`Look, look, it's gotta be fantasy, gotta be fantasy, kihhihihyahyahhyahhyahhyahhyahhyaaaaaahhh!!" `
`"Shut up, shut up, shut uuuuuuuuuuup...!!! `
`Don't talk to meeeeeeee...!!" `
`"......This guy's getting stubborn. `
`...Won't you apologize and crawl on the ground right now for being so conceited that you thought you could beat me...? `
`If you did, I wouldn't mind forgiving you, okay...?" `
`"Then you wouldn't have to have your skin ripped off while you're still alive... `
`or get lashed all over your body as you squirm until you die. `
`Hehheheheheheheheh!" `
`"You're a cutie, so apologize... `
`If you do, I'll finish you off so, so gently, while it still feels great..." `
`"Be silent, furniture of the witch. `
`...I have no intention of speaking with you." `
`"...S-So you're saying you think nothing of me...? `
`Hehhheheheheheheheheh, that disrespectful gaze of yours... `
`...is really ticking me offff!!" `
`"......Kanon-kun........." `
`"............" `
`"...Isn't he stronger than he was against Satan?" `
`"This is why humans are so frightening. `
`In fact, sometimes they even become witches and treat demons as butlers." `
`"Pu ku ku ku ku! `
`So, which should I cheer on?" `
`"...Are you... `
`...saying this guy's on par with me...?!" `
`"......Don't look down on me. `
`As long as you have that pride, you'll never defeat me." `
`"Y-Y- `
`You speak of Lucifer, the eldest of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, and say that I cannot win?! `
`H-How conceited!!" `
`"...Wha........." `
`Kanon was desperately trying to stay alive, and he had a strong desire to become human. `
`But Lucifer didn't feel anything stronger than a slight desire to play. `
`...So, that led to an inevitable result. `
`It was a result that could be reached by the power of humans. `
`...The power of the heart. `
`"......That's as far as you go. `
`You cannot win against me." `
`The glowing red curve extended straight out from Kanon's arm, `
`...pointing at Lucifer's throat, just beneath the tip of her chin... `
`"...Wh- `
`What is this...?! `
`How could I... `
`...There must be some mistake..." `
`As she ground her teeth in irritation, she tried to deny the truth right before her eyes. `
`...But no matter how much she believed in her own superiority, it didn't change the facts right in front of her. `
`"Hoh. `
`...Well done, Kanon. `
`Wonderful, you haven't bored me. `
`...How pitiful my furniture is compared to that. `
`*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"...Lucifer, `
`you are boring Milady. `
`Was this opponent really too much for you to handle...?" `
`"I'm disappointed, eldest of the Seven Staaakes. `
`Hahihihihihihihihihihihi...!" `
`It would have seemed like mere rebuke to an outsider. `
`However, furniture serving the witch knew what kind of severe treatment was promised by that rebuke... `
`and understood what had been left unsaid... `
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaahh!! `
`You...good for nothing furnituuuuuuuuuuuuure!!!" `
`She howled. `
`...Abandoning her last bit of pride, she made her body explode, exposing her true form. `
`That form was a demon stake, which bounced off the walls surrounding the room... `
`"How could you shame me so much?!! `
`Kill, kill, kill, kill!! `
`You blockhead! `
`Even though you can't even follow my movements anymore!! `
`I won't play around anymore, I'm seriously mad, I'll pierce your heart in one blow!! `
`I'll plow right through you, make a fountain of bright-red blood reach the ceiling!! `
`Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeee!!" `
`"K-Kanon-kun......!!" `
`After flying about wildly for some time, with a speed approaching the limits of what a human eye could follow, `
`Lucifer flew at Kanon's heart... `
`She could tell that it was Kanon's blood by the sweet taste of it. `
`...But she quickly noticed one thing. `
`...She hadn't pierced his heart... `
`"......Hoh. `
`*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"This is why humans are frightening. `
`...Would you like some black tea?" `
`"I am fine for now. `
`This is so amusing, I don't even need any...!" `
`"...K... `
`......Kanon-kun......" `
`"You were arrogant again... `
`...I told you that you wouldn't be able to defeat me..." `
`The floor was stained with dripping blood. `
`...It really was Kanon's blood, `
`...but it wasn't flowing out of his chest. `
`Kanon had sacrificed his own left hand to protect his heart... `
`Lucifer was arrogant. `
`Even though she'd been given enough time to realize that this was an opponent capable of cornering her, `
`in her pride, she had believed him to be worthless. `
`She had gotten careless. `
`...So, just as she had announced, she had aimed for his chest, trying to pierce his heart. `
`Because she was arrogant, she hadn't even thought of aiming for somewhere other than the place she had announced. `
`...No, maybe she had thought about it a little. `
`...However, her pride would not allow her to aim for a different spot. `
`After all, she was... `
`...Lucifer of Pride. `
`Kanon, withstanding the pain, `
`grasped the demon stake sticking deep into his left hand strongly with his right hand... `
`and pulled it out... `
`When she heard the sound of breaking bones and even more blood dripping down, `
`Shannon looked away reflexively. `
`There was an air hole in the back of the pierced hand so big, you could clearly see through to the other side... `
`Kanon's face was filled with pain, `
`...but right now, `
`he had won, without a doubt. `
`The demon stake he was gripping with his right hand turned back into Lucifer again... `
`...So that Kanon was now gripping exactly where her neck was. `
`".........Ga, `
`......gu, `
`............" `
`"...It's my victory, `
`......{f:5:Beatrice}." `
`Kanon didn't hold back at all with the hand gripping Lucifer's throat. `
`...She had challenged him again after their fight had already been decided. `
`Kanon had no obligation to be considerate. `
`But even so, Kanon released the witch's furniture. `
`...Was it his naive humanism, his pity for another furniture, `
`or a final bit of respect to the witch? `
`In any case, when she was released, Lucifer fell face-down on the ground, `
`wretching and moaning over the pain in her throat... `
`"Spectacular, Kanon. `
`...Your great efforts have proven the correctness of some of Kinzo's research." `
`Ronove was clapping his hands. `
`...To Kanon, who had won at great cost and had a wound on his left hand that wouldn't close, Ronove's applause only felt like mockery. `
`"...All possibilities dwell within the human heart, was it? `
`......My, my, this is why humans are frightening! `
`Well done, Kanon. `
`You were victorious. `
`Spectacular!" `
`"...Haah, `
`...haah, `
`...haah..." `
`"Are you okay?! `
`Kanon-kun..." `
`Shannon ran up to him and wrapped a handkerchief around his left hand, which was still spraying blood. `
`"That was incredible, Kanon! `
`Truly incredible. `
`Even I was hoping, at least a little, for an upset. `
`That you didn't let me down makes you truly splendid furniture. `
`*cackle*cackle*! `
`I think better of you now. `
`I honestly think better of you!" `
`"...Y-You haven't forgotten our promise, right, `
`...{f:5:Beatrice}...?" `
`"Indeed. `
`Of course I haven't forgotten. `
`Witches and demons may be inhumane. `
`However, we are much more noble than humans when it comes to keeping promises." `
`"I will not go back on my word. `
`I guaranteed that if you won, `
`I would give you the right to decide the five people who will escape becoming the 13 sacrifices." `
`"...B-{f:5:Beatrice}-sama, `
`it's not like I've, lo... `
`higi!!" `
`When {f:5:Beatrice} waved her pipe, heaven and earth turned over just for Lucifer. `
`...So, as a horribly natural result, she "fell" onto the ceiling. `
`The ceiling doesn't seem that high to people standing on the floor. `
`...However, people who fall on it upside-down and head-first usually don't agree... `
`"Milady, `
`isn't that a little much?" `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`Perhaps you are right. `
`I suppose I'll forgive her." `
`{f:5:Beatrice} waved her pipe again. `
`When she did, the magic that had been effecting Lucifer was released. `
`...So, as a horribly natural result, this time she "fell" properly, back onto the floor. `
`"Agah......!!" `
`...gghh... `
`............u, `
`{f:5:Beatrice}-sama, `
`...f-forgive me......" `
`"What are you so afraid of? `
`I have already forgiven you, haven't I? `
`*cackle*! `
`So, Kanon. `
`Shall we continue?" `
`"......Continue what? `
`...You aren't saying you want me to finish her, are you...?!" `
`"Ah, no, no. `
`It isn't over yet, right?" `
`"......What isn't? `
`...Stop dodging the question...!!" `
`"I did promise to you your reward, didn't I? `
`If you could defeat my furniture, {i:the Seven Stakes of Purgatory}, riiiiiiight?" `
`"Come, arise, the Seven Stakes of Purgatory. `
`The six younger sisters of the worthless elder sister!" `
`""""""Kyahhahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"""""" `
`The air split with shrill laughter, `
`and as a golden splash scattered about, the remaining six Sisters of Purgatory showed themselves... `
`All the Seven Sisters of Purgatory were here, after Kanon was able to defeat one only by sacrificing his left arm... `
`By now, Kanon regretted his thoughtlessness in accepting the witch's challenge. `
`...He had been foolish to assume that a game against a witch would be on an even footing...! `
`"......Laaame. `
`Onee-sama, why are you crawling on the floor?" `
`"Y-You people......... `
`nnnggh..." `
`"I told you, Onee-sama's useless. `
`Even though she acts like she's so great just because she's the oldest, that's only on the outside." `
`"Yeah, seriously! `
`Lucifer onee-sama, your disgraceful behavior will damage the reputation of us all! `
`Know your shame! `
`You novice!" `
`"......Nng, ......gggh..." `
`"Kanon-kuuun, that was totally awesome. `
`But don't get cocky, okay? `
`Lucifer onee-sama brags all the time, but she's no big deal compared to the rest of us sisters." `
`"...That's why I'm always saying Lucifer-nee shouldn't do anything. `
`Just let her keep bragging all the time. `
`After all, those of us with talent can handle all the tough jobs." `
`"What are you gonna do, Onee-sama? `
`Out of respect for your pride, `
`we were planning to stay out of your way, in the hopes that you'd challenge him again in that beat-up body of yours..." `
`"...But Kanon-kun sure is strong, right? `
`Right now, no matter how much you struggle, there's no way you could win, right...?" `
`"...Y- `
`You people......" `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`My, my, you sisters are always so lively. `
`Is this any time to fight amongst yourselves? `
`It's only together that you're the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, correct? `
`Now, play nice and execute the tasks I give you. `
`And swiftly, okay?" `
`"Hey, Lucifer onee-sama, `
`if you wanna borrow the power of your little sisters, `
`...then say it, okay? `
`We wanna hear you ask us for help with your own mouth." `
`"Nng...... Do you plan to mock me even more......?!" `
`"‘I, the foolish— `
`weak, `
`ugly, `
`and shameful... `
`...Lucifer, the eldest sister, beg my younger sisters to save me'. `
`......C'mon, let's hear it. `
`If you let us hear that, we'll save you. `
`That's a deal, right? `
`Everyone?!" `
`"...You... `
`...b- `
`bitch..." `
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory unanimously closed in on their worthless sister. `
`Abusing her. `
`...Even Kanon, who had been fighting for his life until a second ago, couldn't bear to look at it... `
`"A-As if... `
`...as if I... `
`could say... `
`something like that..." `
`"Quickly now. `
`Clearly, we won't make any progress here with you alone. `
`Hurry up, let the Seven Sisters strike Kanon." `
`"Pu ku ku ku... `
`My, my, what is the matter, Lucifer? `
`This is an order from Milady, is it not?" `
`"......How cruel." `
`After grinding her teeth over and over after hearing her sisters' curses, `
`......Lucifer trembled all over... `
`and answered her sisters' request... `
`"......I-I, the foolish, `
`...weak, `
`......ugly... `
`...whaa...!" `
`"And shameful!!" `
`"Sh‐...shameful, `
`...Lucifer, the eldest sister, `
`...beg... `
`......whaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!! `
`Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...!!" `
`The girl known as Pride was finally unable to endure the words she was saying... `
`and broke down crying. `
`However, the six younger sisters kept giggling coldheartedly. `
`"Wait a sec! `
`Don't try to trick us by crying! `
`You haven't finished saying iiit!" `
`"That should be enough. `
`Come, sisters, let us display our power." `
`"I won't be satisfied 'til I hear the whole thing, okay?! `
`C'mon, c'mon, Onee-sama, keep going!" `
`"That's enough! `
`Come on, this shame effects us all! `
`We won't let them leave here alive!" `
`"Okay, how should we play with this pitiful furniture? `
`Any wonderful plans?" `
`"Ye-s, yes! `
`Beelze thiiinks the seven of us shooould get along and split Kanon up between us!" `
`"Good idea. `
`...That way all of the sisters can get along." `
`"Then I'll take the head! `
`I'll leave the limbs and guts to you all!!" `
`"No, no, noooooooooooo!! `
`I get the heeead!!" `
`"There's no way that promise'll mean anything, right?! `
`First one there wins!" `
`"Hihihihihi!! `
`Kanon-kun, if you've got any ideas for how we should kill you, just tell us, okay? `
`The Seven Sisters'll kill you in an aaawesome way!" `
`"............Damn..." `
`"...Aaarrrrrrgggh!! `
`You've shamed me so deeply!! `
`Slicing you into eight pieces won't be enough!! `
`I'll slice you into a hundred pieces!! `
`Here we go, everyone!!" `
`""""""Yeees, Onee-sama! `
`Kyahhahahahahahaha!!"""""" `
`The seven of them burst at once. `
`They had no intention of playing or boasting. `
`This time, they would genuinely follow their master's order. `
`...Take Kanon down. Swiftly! `
`The Seven Sisters jumped around the room faster than the eye could see, examining how they could best kill Kanon. `
`They tortured Kanon with their cruel giggles, sometimes making a close pass at him. `
`...They kept scraping his arms, shoulders, and cheeks, `
`gradually carving red letters into his body... `
`At that moment, Shannon dashed up behind him, holding on to him so that she blocked the way to his body at least a little. `
`"{nobreak:{m:-5:—}—}Kh......!!" `
`"Ah......?!" `
`At the same time, a red cylinder wrapped around the two of them, like a beam of light sent from heaven. `
`That cylinder repelled the evil ones who tormented Kanon... `
`"Whaaaat?!! `
`You're me-an! `
`This has nothing to do with yo-u!" `
`"Ah, I see. `
`You must want to play with us." `
`"Kyaha! `
`Then I'll take i-t! `
`All mine!!" `
`"{f:5:Beatrice}-sama, `
`can we take Shannon as our prey...?" `
`"Hmm? `
`Aah, I don't mind, do as you like. `
`It seems Kanon alone won't be enough to satisfy your gluttony." `
`"You have our deepest gratitude. `
`Come on, I'll make you regret coming out uninvited!" `
`"I'll turn you into scraps of meat so unrecognizable, you won't be able to tell which is which, `
`mix you and mix you and mince you into hamburgers!" `
`"Idiot, breaking that barrier should come first, right?! `
`Don't let your gluttony get in the way of your job!" `
`""""Yees, Onee-sama!!"""" `
`"Gu......uuu......!!" `
`As a horribly natural first action, the Seven Sisters began to destroy the barrier Shannon had created. `
`...Shannon's barrier certainly was strong. `
`It was powerful enough to impress even {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`...With its strength, frail furniture would turn to dust just by touching it, `
`and it was firm, like a tree with deep roots. `
`But no matter how big a tree gets, it will eventually surrender to a saw or a hatchet. `
`For the Seven Sisters, "chopping down" Shannon's barrier would be annoying, but not impossible. `
`"Hnf......!!" `
`A sound like beetles jumping about grew even fiercer and filled the room. `
`The red barrier began to be cut up and eroded away as though with an hatchet, a saw...no, a chainsaw by now... `
`"......How foolish. `
`Even though you must know that your barrier can't fully protect you from these girls. `
`Why...?" `
`"......Because I couldn't overlook it." `
`As Shannon covered Kanon, who was already at his limits, sprawled on the floor, she spoke back resolutely. `
`"If you hadn't barged in uninvited, I would have given you a death like sleep. `
`Why have you gone to all the trouble of exposing yourself before the Seven Sisters? `
`...Not all deaths are the same. `
`A cruel death will cause you far more anguish than merely dying. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"......Go ahead, do as you like. `
`Just as you always do what you want, I did what I wanted." `
`"......... `
`...Hmmmm. `
`At any rate, you're not quite amusing at the present moment. `
`Romance is most interesting when you're wondering whether it will succeed or not." `
`"Once it does succeed, a woman is like salmon who has finished laying its eggs. `
`I have already tired of you." `
`"Thank you. `
`No words from a witch would make me happier." `
`"...Hehehehhihihahaha. `
`Then, at least in the end, let me see you die in a truly entertaining manner. `
`Seven Sisters, can you hear me?! `
`Kill Shannon in a way that shows me the limits of brutality!!" `
`".........Shannon..." `
`"...My apologies. `
`In the end, I wasn't able to reach your level, Genji-sama." `
`"......You're an idiot, Nee-san... `
`If you'd just let me be, ...then you might not have had to meet a horrible end..." `
`"No, it's fine. `
`...I received a ring from George-sama and lived as a woman. `
`I have protected you and lived as a sister. `
`With this, my life is complete, with no regrets." `
`"...Nnnngyaaaaaaaaaaahhhh, you're pissing me off. `
`That philosophical take really is irritating!! `
`Like I said, you're furniture, you don't even smell like a humaaaaaan!!" `
`"Look at me, {i:I} am human!! `
`Don't spout off philosophical crap, like you're more complete than I am, you furnituuuuuuuuuuure!!" `
`"......How ugly. `
`Are those regrets...what you truly are?" `
`"They aren't regreeeeeets, this is called living!! `
`What's this about not minding if you die, just because you were given a ring?! `
`Aaaaah, I can't understand it, it's incomprehensible, disappointing, outrageous, stunning, and it's all useleeeeeeeesss!!" `
`"...Milady, perhaps you're acting a tad undignified." `
`"Shut up, furniture!! `
`Shannooooonn, do you think I'll let you die so easilyyyyyyyyyyy?! `
`Now's the time to bite your tooooooongue!!" `
`"......How pitiful. `
`If you can see yourself reflected in my eyes, `
`then shudder at your own ugliness." `
`"Fear not, `
`once I've crushed you up, you'll be much more ugly even while you still liiiiiiiive!!!" `
`At that time, ......Genji softly entered the red barrier. `
`Perhaps that barrier didn't block those without ill intent. `
`Then, ...Genji gently held her from behind... `
`and covered her eyes with his right hand. `
`"......Genji-sama..." `
`"You've already done enough... `
`......Go to sleep before me." `
`"......Yes. `
`......Thank you very much, Genji-sama..." `
`"......Indeed." `
`After that, Genji softly pressed his left hand near her collarbone... `
`...As he did, eminating from that area... `
`a crimson stain gently spread out. `
`When Genji removed his hand, `
`......bright-red, fresh blood oozed out of there. `
`It only happened for the first instant, and it was shaped like a crimson rose... `
`And when he removed his right hand covering her face, `
`......there was a peaceful expression there, as though she was sleeping. `
`......And she fell softly, `
`...silently, `
`......and slept. `
`Her soul had already been sent to a world where the malicious witch and her furniture could not reach her, `
`no matter how evilly they tortured her... `
`This scene left {f:5:Beatrice} and the Seven Sisters stunned. `
`...Only Ronove wore a mysterious smile. `
`Then, Genji leaned over Kanon, who was crouching on the floor. `
`"......You did well. `
`You should sleep now too." `
`"............ `
`......Yes. `
`Thank you very much, Genji-sama." `
`Just as he had done with Shannon, he softly covered Kanon's eyes with his hand, `
`then gently pressed the area around Kanon's collarbone with his other hand. `
`...And when his hand was removed with the lightness of a feather, `
`...there was a crimson rose there. `
`But that rose shape quickly turned into the stain of bright-red blood pouring out... `
`"...Wh- `
`What is...that...?" `
`"...What a boring person. `
`...Even though it's so fun to poke the balloon of life with a needle so that it forcefully explodes." `
`"Spectacular, Genji. `
`......You truly are furniture." `
`"...Thank you very much. `
`...Well then, {f:5:Beatrice}-sama, Ronove-sama. `
`With this as my final task, allow me to rest." `
`"......Tch. `
`Damn you, snatching away my fun. `
`Why don't I take all the thrashing and mashing I wanted to do to them... `
`and give it to you instead??" `
`{f:5:Beatrice} faced him with an unsatisfied expression, `
`but Ronove spoke quietly to Genji with a soothing smile. `
`"You have worked hard. `
`You are my greatest servant. `
`...As a final gift, I shall bestow upon you a peaceful sleep fitting for all the labors you have performed." `
`"What?! `
`Wait, it's not your place to...!" `
`When Ronove snapped his fingers, `
`...Genji slumped to the floor like a puppet with its strings cut. `
`...Suddenly, and yet gently. `
`He crumpled, falling into a sleep that no witch could call him back from... `
`It was as filled with kindness as the sleep he had given Shannon and Kanon... `
`"...What was that, Ronove? `
`...What a boring anticlimax." `
`"Are you not a mighty Great Witch, Milady? `
`What happened here is hardly worthy of your concern. `
`...It isn't like you, to let the provocation of someone like Shannon get to you." `
`"............ `
`...Hmm." `
`What was it that had {f:5:Beatrice} so irritated? `
`...Was she still unable to remove the thorn of Shannon's words? `
`Ronove laughed lightly, as though lamenting the complexity of humanity and a woman's heart, and ordered the Seven Sisters to go. `
`...After all, there were still two sacrifices left for the first twilight. `
`The Seven Sisters disappeared in ecstasy... `
