`...30 minutes had already passed since Rudolf's group had left the guesthouse. `
`By any measure, their return was too late. `
`...And Krauss and Natsuhi, who waited by the entrance, were reaching the limits of their patience. `
`The chain was set on the door. `
`That was a precaution in the event that Rudolf's group was attacked and the master key stolen from them. `
`For that reason, they needed to wait by the entrance like this for the others to return... `
`"...They really are too late. `
`Don't you think something might have happened to them...?" `
`"......Indeed..." `
`Krauss glanced between his watch and the door, struggling to keep his composure. `
`"If...something happened to prevent them from returning..." `
`"...A terrible thought, but it seems we should ready ourselves for that possibility. `
`...So, it really was too reckless after all." `
`"Th-That is what I said...! `
`Why did they go outside when they knew it was this dangerous...?! `
`How foolish! `
`Why go outside, even though Rosa-san had just been attacked...?!!" `
`"......Nothing will come of saying that now. `
`...At any rate, there are now three adults in the guesthouse. `
`Me, you, `
`...and Eva, who's asleep with a high fever." `
`At that time, the forceful sound of a door being opened came from the hallway, and they heard Eva's panicked voice. `
`...That voice kept calling out Hideyoshi's name. `
`...It seemed as though she'd had a bad dream or something due to her fever...and was calling for her husband. `
`"Eva-san, `
`...what is it, are you okay...?" `
`"...Wh-Where is my husband?! `
`My husband isn't here!! `
`Even though he promised that he'd stay with me the whole time! `
`Even though he promised that he'd grasp my hand the whole time!!" `
`...Krauss was struck dumb by this attitude of hers, which she had never shown in front of him before, but Natsuhi understood her feelings. `
`"...C-Calm down... `
`Hideyoshi-san is with Rudolf-san and Kyrie-san, and they're outside right now." `
`"Outside?!?! `
`Wh-Wh-Why, `
`why did he go outside, `
`after he promised that he'd stay with me the whole time?! `
`You mustn't go outside, the witch is outside, you mustn't go, you'll be killed!! `
`Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!" `
`"...Eva, calm yourself. `
`...Hideyoshi-san returned to the mansion with Rudolf and Kyrie-san." `
`"Why did he have to go to the mansion?!! `
`Why did he go outside, even though it's safe here?!! `
`Why did he go back to the mansion?!!" `
`"............ `
`...They went to get enough food to last until tomorrow. `
`...Hideyoshi-san was worried about your health...and said that was partly why he wanted to go..." `
`"When will they come back?! `
`When will they come back?! `
`Don't go outside, don't go to the rose garden, don't go to the mansion!! `
`The witch is there, the Golden Witch is walking about! `
`If she finds you, you'll be killed, you'll definitely be killed!! `
`When will my husband come back?!" `
`"......They left here thirty minutes ago. `
`We are waiting for their return." `
`"Th-Thirty minutes ago?! `
`Isn't that strange? Why would it take so much time for them to go to the mansion to get food and come back?! `
`And why are you two just standing around here?! `
`We have to go get them!! `
`We have to hurry to where they are!! `
`Eeeeeeeeeeeekkk!!" `
`Eva probably had quite a nightmare. `
`...And, because it had continued even after she woke up, she could no longer hide her panic. `
`Natsuhi tried calming her down, but all it did was make Eva's emotions explode even more. `
`...Maybe they heard that disturbance. `
`Battler and the kids, who had supposedly been on the second floor, were peeking their faces through the crack of the lobby door. `
`Krauss, Natsuhi, Eva. `
`And Battler, George, Jessica, Nanjo. `
`...Everyone in the guesthouse had gathered by the entrance...and understood the current situation. `
`"I agree with Mother. `
`We should go to check on Father and the rest." `
`"Yeah, that's right. `
`It's even possible that their load's too heavy and they're having trouble carrying it. `
`They should welcome some extra hands." `
`"...Th-This happened right after Rosa-san was attacked. `
`...This may have been a secondary disaster connected to that. `
`We should act with caution here and..." `
`"Don't be a fool!! `
`What do you mean, caution?! `
`Are you saying we should let my husband die, even though he might be begging for help?! `
`I'm going to look, and the cowards can stay here!!" `
`Looking agitated, Eva raised her gun. `
`Judging by her face, it would be useless for anyone to try and stop her. `
`...George, who realized that first, raised his head. `
`"I'll go as well. `
`You will too, right, Battler-kun? `
`The more people, the better...!" `
`"S-Sure!! `
`Aunt Eva, we're coming even if you tell us not to." `
`"...I-I'm coming too...! `
`I can't be the only one to hide in a safe place...!" `
`"Jessica, you must not go outside!! `
`Stay here with me. `
`Got it?!" `
`It was like they were implying that those three had already been killed anyway, so going outside would be pointless. `
`Natsuhi realized that Eva felt like her heart had been gouged out, but she spoke out strongly as Jessica's mother. `
`".........You're right. `
`That should be fine. `
`Let's have Nii-san's family keep an eye on the guesthouse. `
`This is a problem for my family and Battler-kun's. `
`And I wonder if Doctor Nanjo would mind coming too. `
`Just in case." `
`"......In the hall of the mansion, Battler, Eva, George, and Nanjo... `
`found the corpses of Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi." `
`"......The fourth through sixth twilights? `
`Then, the corpses were pierced through the forehead, chest, and stomach with those demon stakes?" `
`"Yes. `
`...The demon stakes were buried into them: one in Rudolf's forehead, `
`one in Hideyoshi's chest, `
`and one in Kyrie's stomach." `
`"The disorder of the clothing on all three suggests that they were fighting or running away. `
`Since the three corpses were not found right next to each other, it is hypothesized that after coming into contact with the culprit, they attempted some form of resistance." `
`"......And they had stakes in the forehead, chest, and stomach. `
`...Horrible, just like usual..." `
`"............" `
`Even though Ronove knew it would be superfluous, he contemplated telling Battler the truth. `
`...Normally, the witch would have killed them in a much, much more horrible way. `
`...The corpses had been left in this manner only because Beato had suggested to the witch that she show restraint. `
`The new witch, thinking it would fit well enough as long as she gouged them with stakes, `
`...would probably have just stuck a stake into a lump of meat that wasn't even shaped like a Human. `
`Rosa's and Maria's corpses were a particularly striking example. `
`...If they'd been killed as the Golden Witch had wished, just how gruesome would the corpses have been? `
`Beato had changed that into the "still better" kind of killing Battler had mentioned earlier. `
`Wanting to have Beato's small bit of thoughtfulness appreciated, he thought of telling Battler about this. `
`...But judging by Battler's eyes, that might do more harm than good. `
`To humans, the gap between being alive and being dead is very large. `
`Saying that she'd given them better deaths might have made it possible for a demon to understand her feelings and pardon her, `
`but there was no way a Human would be so accepting. `
`Understanding this, Ronove remained silent despite knowing of Beato's modest efforts... `
`"Just like usual, let's start by checking whether the corpses are dead. `
`...Ronove, please declare it in red." `
`"............" `
`"Hey, can't you hear me? `
`...Please declare it in red. `
`Repeat it. `
`"Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi are dead"." `
`"......My apologies. `
`Allow me to decline from repeating that." `
`"The hell...? `
`What are you planning, all of a sudden...?" `
`By now, proclaiming that the victims were dead in red was almost a given in this battle. `
`Refusing to do that was almost like losing by default. `
`...So when Ronove refused as part of his first move, Battler was dumbfounded. `
`"My apologies. `
`As of this moment, I relinquish my position as Milady's representative. `
`...Accordingly, "I" cannot repeat that in red. `
`...The only one qualified to repeat that...is Milady." `
`"........." `
`"...His point is a valid one. `
`Ronove is only a representative for Beato's side. `
`...If he steps down from that position, and if you will not accept Beato as an opponent, `
`...a new representative must be named." `
`"...No new representative exists. `
`...Please, Battler-sama. `
`Please accept Milady as your game partner once more." `
`"......Sorry, `
`but that's advice I can't listen to. `
`...I definitely won't accept that unpleasant, cruel bastard as my opponent. `
`...My refusal to accept her is why I can't step down from this game." `
`"As to her being unpleasant, I apologize in Milady's stead. `
`Allow me to pledge that Milady will not undertake such unpleasant actions again." `
`"......... `
`...I wonder about that." `
`"...Battler-kun, `
`I also want to apologize as that child's teacher. `
`I'll give that child a good talking to, so please offer your forgiveness just this once." `
`"...Hey, hey, enough of that. `
`You're making it sound like I'm the bad guy. `
`...And no matter how much you guys apologize, it won't reach my ears. `
`...If Beato can say that from her own lips, `
`......well, I might listen to her." `
`"......Understood. `
`If that is your only condition for acknowledging your opponent again, let us have that child apologize. `
`......Ronove, `
`call for that child. `
`Will that be all right, Battler-kun...?" `
`"......Sheesh. `
`...Do whatever you want. `
`Still, don't expect me to forgive her. `
`...Go get that irritating witch." `
`"...You have my thanks, Battler-sama. `
`...I shall summon her here. `
`...Milady, Battler-sama is calling for you." `
`After a few heartbeats, gold butterflies gathered together in midair and created Beato's form. `
`...It was a much more docile appearance than the one's she'd made before. `
`"......Did you call, Ronove?" `
`"...I believe you heard. `
`...Is there something you have to say, from your own lips...?" `
`"............" `
`"............" `
`It looked as though Beato shrunk slightly under Battler's cold gaze. `
`Several times, Beato made an effort to get the words out of her mouth, but that didn't work so well, `
`...and she was just as awkward as someone trying to light a match during a freezing winter with icy hands... `
`Even as she did that, the game board was advancing... `
`In the hall, they had just found the corpses of the new victims and had broken down crying... `
`"......Dad, `
`...Kyrie-san, `
`...oooooooooooooooooohhhh, `
`...nnngaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh..." `
`"Dear, ...deeeaar, ...whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh...!!" `
`"...Mother, `
`...hang in there... `
`...Even for me it's... `
`...so crushing... `
`...so sad...!!" `
`".........They probably died instantly. `
`...I'm sure that, even if we had arrived immediately after they fell, it would have been too late..." `
`"No, that's wrong!! `
`They were definitely alive!! `
`His chest was stabbed with something like this...! `
`My husband must have died in extreme pain...!! `
`If we had come faster, ...surely they would've been saved! `
`They would definitely have been saved!! `
`Uuuuuwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh..." `
`"...It must be tough...for you too, Battler-kun, ......but stay strong..." `
`"......I'm okay, ...it's okay, Aniki... `
`Let me cry just a little bit longer... `
`...I've got it the best... `
`I should be the least sad...! `
`So if you let me cry just a little longer, ...I'll be fine..." `
`"That isn't true... `
`...I can understand how much it must hurt your heart to have lost both parents... `
`...I still have Mother. `
`...That's much better than what you're going through, Battler-kun..." `
`"No, that's wrong!! `
`It's got to be toughest for you, George-aniki... `
`...I understand, Aniki... `
`...In this group, ...you're the saddest...and the one who has it toughest!! `
`I understand that, `
`...so I can't keep on sobbing like this...!! `
`Aaaaaaaaaaaggghhhh!!" `
`"...Why...do you say it's toughest for me...?" `
`"To me, Dad and Kyrie-san...were people I'd eventually split up with when I grew up and became independent. `
`Since they're parents, it was fated that they'd die before their kids. `
`...It just happened a little early, that's all...!" `
`"......But it's different for you, Aniki. `
`You didn't just lose your parents, who would've parted ways with you eventually. `
`...You also lost Shannon-chan, `
`...someone you should've spent the rest of your life with...!!" `
`"............" `
`"You can't value human lives differently. `
`Whether it's a baby or an old person, they should all be respected the same...! `
`...But still, the more life that person has ahead of them, `
`...the longer the future you're building together is, ......the sadder the fact of their death is...!!" `
`"Aniki, you were engaged to Shannon-chan, right? `
`You promised that you'd build a life and a home together in the future, right?! `
`......Compared to how huge that future was, ...compared to how huge that happiness was, `
`...stuff like my pain doesn't even come close...!!" `
`"......So you should be allowed to cry much, much more, Aniki...!! `
`And yet, ...just because you act like a big brother to us cousins, `
`......you force yourself to act like you're so calm...!" `
`"......Stop it, ...Battler-kun." `
`George was trying to make a calm smile. `
`...But already, ......he couldn't stop a single hot tear from leaving a streak down his face. `
`"...There's no way I wouldn't... `
`...be sad, right...? `
`......Together with Shannon, I painted a picture of many futures in my mind. `
`We talked of dreams that couldn't all come true even if we lived a hundred years. `
`...Of those dreams, `
`even the very first one, `
`......having her move into my family register, could not be granted, `
`......so there's no way I wouldn't... `
`...be sad, right......?" `
`"Compared to that, I...I...!! `
`Like I said, I have no right to cry any more! `
`When even you're struggling to hold it in, I have no right to shed any more tears!!" `
`"...We're the same. `
`...We both feel the same sadness from losing those close to us. `
`......So there's no rule that says you can't shed any more tears than me, Battler-kun." `
`"......And, `
`...for me too, ...there's no rule...that says I have to hold back my tears any longer, is there?" `
`"...Aniki, ...Anikii...!!! `
`Aaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!" `
`"Shannon, the one who shared my dreams for the future, is dead. `
`Father's dead too. `
`......It's so sad, ...so sad... `
`...Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!" `
`As Battler and George hugged each other tightly, they cried a waterfall of tears over each other's shoulders for the people who had been so precious to them... `
`"......Do you understand why I said that George-aniki has it the toughest...?" `
`"...I-I was listening, so I understand. `
`...Your sadness is proportional to the length of time you would have been able to spend with that person afterwards..." `
`"...Of course, you can't calculate it just like that though. `
`......We Humans aren't like you witches. `
`...From the time we receive life to the moment we die, we live within that limited period as strongly as we can manage." `
`"......I can't forgive anyone who makes light of that. `
`...And I definitely can't forgive anyone who sneers at people and toys with them. `
`...A person like you, whose very concept of death is all screwed up, probably can't understand that." `
`"............" `
`"...I'm not just mad because of the length of time they would've lived afterwards. `
`It's...sneering at the lives of people living with all they've got... `
`That's what I can't forgive the most." `
`"George-aniki lived his life by recklessly doing his best. `
`...He must have approached this day with a grim resolve to marry Shannon-chan no matter the challenges. `
`...That's completely different from me, since I was happy just to be able to meet my cousins after a long while." `
`"...B-But still..." `
`"Beato. `
`For now, stay silent and listen." `
`"......I-Indeed." `
`"......In a way, I understand your point. `
`...You say you need to continue murdering according to the epitaph for your own resurrection." `
`"...So, considering your circumstances, `
`...I can just barely bring myself to understand your murders. `
`...Because to you, it's a necessary course of action. `
`...But that means all unnecessary actions you take beyond that...are due to your meaningless and brutal tastes." `
`"...In other words, if killing the six people for the first twilight was a "necessary action" for you, `
`...then all that show of crushing their faces and splitting their stomachs and stuffing them full of sweets was completely unnecessary, `
`and caused by nothing more than your brutal hobby. `
`......That's an aspect of you that I definitely cannot forgive." `
`"......I-Indeed..." `
`"When you saw Aunt Rosa getting repeatedly killed in that horrible way, `
`...you apparently said something like `
`"If they're going to be brought back to life in the end anyway, it doesn't matter how they're killed." `
`I heard from {f:5:Virgilia}." `
`".........That was... `
`...well, `
`...umm......" `
`"That idea that you can kill them as many times as you want, as long as you bring them back to life in the end... `
`Isn't that a completely unnecessary action, with no purpose other than to toy around with someone's life?" `
`"......If you're going to kill, do it instantly! `
`Don't toy with them!! `
`If you won't kill them, then don't bully them!! `
`You're taking advantage of the fact that you can do as you will with people's lives, and you've forgotten the sanctity of life. `
`So I can't accept or acknowledge you...! `
`I definitely can't accept as my opponent a person who doesn't know the value of a life...or the sadness felt when lives are lost!" `
`"......That is why the Endless Magic is known as a black art. `
`...The Endless Witch has no concept of limitations. `
`...She has no concept of the limitations and losses caused by breaking and killing." `
`"...For that reason, Endless Witches sometimes start playing by jumping over the gap between life and death `
`like it's a game. `
`......That is a very, very frightening thing. `
`So as an Endless Witch, and by my own choosing, `
`{i:I never reached your level}." `
`It was something {f:5:Virgilia} had been trying to tell Beato for a long time. `
`But Beato had been too young to obediently listen to those words. `
`She had been too wild. `
`...She had been possessed by that detestable pleasure. `
`"...I have been told not to break vases. `
`...But that's why I wanted to break them. `
`......Then I gained the Endless Magic. `
`...When I knew that I could fix them back to normal no matter how badly I broke them, `
`...I was surprised at how fun it could be to break a vase..." `
`"That is what's known as the forbidden honey. `
`People are not captivated by what's inside. `
`They are captivated by the sealed lock. `
`......It is truly regrettable." `
`"......I want to ask you, {f:5:Virgilia}. `
`Why does this thing called the Endless Magic exist? `
`...For what purpose does it exist in this world?" `
`"It is not limited to the Endless Magic. `
`...All magic exists to bring happiness to the human world. `
`...After everything that has happened, it may be difficult for you to believe, Battler-kun, ...but in order to bring blessings to the human world, `
`we witches are supposed to become bridges between humans and nonhumans, and that is why we train so hard." `
`"...How does reviving the dead and torturing them to death over and over again help the human world?" `
`"When a vase that was an important memento is broken, `
`if by fixing it, everyone will regain their smiles, I would repair it with magic as many times as necessary. `
`However, I would not be fixing it in order to break it again. `
`...I would be reviving it to give humans happiness." `
`"In that case, `
`......Beato, `
`you fail as an Endless Witch." `
`"............I-Indeed..." `
`"...There's this thing I've been vaguely thinking about. `
`......Why do I keep playing this strange game against you?" `
`"...Maybe this game isn't about making me surrender. `
`...Maybe it's a test for you to be accepted as an Endless Witch...{i:in the truest sense}." `
`"...I-I don't know about that. `
`...The reason I proposed this game to you was...umm...simply as a way to kill time... `
`There were no ulterior motives at work." `
`"Just now, I heard the definition of a witch from {f:5:Virgilia}. `
`By that definition, you, Beato, `
`are not even a witch. `
`You're an apprentice who's still in training...and who misunderstands her own power." `
`"...This was supposed to a fight between a witch and a human. `
`If you aren't a witch, then you aren't qualified to be my opponent. `
`......Understand?" `
`"...You say... `
`...I am still... `
`...only an apprentice...? `
`Then, when will I be accepted as your opponent once again? `
`...When can we resume this game?" `
`"......Who knows. `
`...At the very least, it isn't now. `
`...When you fully understand what I've said and become a real witch, `
`...I'll probably accept you as my opponent in this game once more." `
`"I-I can't understand if you say it so abstractly like that... `
`Clearly tell me what I should do to earn your forgiveness..." `
`"No, I've said enough. `
`You think about the rest. `
`......That's all I want to say. `
`...If you can't figure it out, try talking with {f:5:Virgilia} and Ronove. `
`...A brat like you should start off by listening to what the adults say." `
`"......{f:5:Virgilia}, `
`suspend the game for now. `
`Now that Ronove has stepped down as a representative, `
`all we can do is wait for Beato to gain the qualifications of a proper opponent." `
`"...Understood. `
`...Until Beato has been acknowledged as having earned those qualifications, the game will proceed without an opponent. `
`Is that all right with you too, Beato?" `
`"...I-I have no objections. `
`......I want time...and a place where I can think at a leisurely pace. `
`...May I leave my seat for that?" `
`"......Yeah, that's fine." `
`"...Well then, see you...later." `
`"Wait. `
`...Don't make that dejected face." `
`"............Sorry about that. `
`Letting everything inside my heart show up on my face is part of my personality. `
`I cannot deceive." `
`"Then maybe there's still some hope for you. `
`......Let me promise you one thing. `
`In this game with you, I might win, and I might lose. `
`...If you don't come back, it might be my victory by default." `
`At that point, Battler stopped talking for a second. `
`...Then he spoke forcefully. `
`"......However, I definitely won't be the one to step down. `
`I definitely won't give you a victory by default. `
`...I'll keep on waiting here for you to sit there again as my worthy opponent." `
`"...Battler-sama..." `
`"......Thank you, `
`Battler. `
`...I will definitely...come back and be accepted by you." `
`After showing a hopeful smile for a very short while, Beato vanished. `
`...After seeing her expression as she left, Battler was absolutely convinced that her face could tell no lies... `
`The seven survivors returned to the guesthouse once again. `
`By now, it was clear that those who went outside would not return alive. `
`Rudolf's group had gone out with two guns and a master key. `
`But those had been lost. `
`It was already clear that those had been stolen by the culprit. `
`Because the shutters were closed on the windows, they couldn't be opened even if the culprit had a master key. `
`The front and back doors that led to the outside were all sealed by chains, `
`and they were further blocked with sofas and tables. `
`Even if the culprit decided to break in through violent means, it wouldn't be easy for them. `
`"...At this point, the typhoon may actually be fortunate. `
`If it were clear outside, it might have been possible for them to set fire to the guesthouse." `
`"If there wasn't a typhoon in the first place, the boat would have arrived before noon. `
`That's not much of a silver lining." `
`"...Eva-san, how do you feel? `
`Please, try to take it easy." `
`"Thank you. `
`...I still feel like I have a fever, but this is no time to complain about that. `
`...For the children's sake as well, this is no time to be bedridden." `
`After crying so much in front of Hideyoshi's corpse, `
`Eva had felt a strong self-awareness of her position as a mother, and her expression conveyed a strong will. `
`...In actual fact, her fever still hadn't gone down. `
`And she was aware of that. `
`If she didn't keep a strong hold on herself, she felt as though the fever would make her mind hazy again. `
`By this point, the first floor formed a final line of defense set up by Krauss, Natsuhi, and Eva. `
`The children and the guest, Nanjo, had been strongly warned not to go downstairs without taking great care. `
`If the culprit used a ladder or something, it probably wouldn't be impossible for them to attack from the second floor. `
`But it wouldn't be easy for them to break those sturdy shutters from such an insecure position. `
`The second floor was relatively safe compared to the first. `
`Battler and George had also wanted to remain on the first floor so that they could fight if the worst happened, but Eva had put a stop to that. `
`In her mind, George was now the only member of her family. `
`It seemed that she didn't even want to expose him to the danger of coming downstairs to the first floor. `
`Krauss and Natsuhi could understand that feeling. `
`...Also, a great deal of time had passed since the siege began. `
`In the second floor cousins' room, Battler, George, and Jessica sat dazed... `
`and didn't even listen to the TV that had been left on. `
`For a while, Nanjo had been with them and had tried to lend them words of encouragement, `
`but when he realized that he might actually be having the opposite effect, he hid himself in his own room on the same second floor. `
`George kept looking dazedly at the photographs inserted in his notebook. `
`...It was from the time he'd taken a vacation to Okinawa with Shannon. `
`Shannon's happy smile was contained in those photos. `
`...George could remember the temperature and the humidity, the warmth and strength of the wind, `
`and even what he had been talking about with her at the time those photos had been taken...as clearly as though it had been yesterday. `
`So to George, they weren't simply photos, `
`but a door to bring back warm memories... `
`In this room, even though the sound of the typhoon and the TV should have entered George's hearing, `
`...it was the scenery of Okinawa he had seen with her and her laughing voice that reached his eyes and his ears... `
`George had strived to be reborn after meeting Shannon. `
`He had sworn to separate himself from the timid person he had once been, `
`easily caught up in the atmosphere, unable to refuse a request, and easily used by those around him. `
`...He had resolved himself to become a strong man who could make her life more joyous. `
`Therefore. `
`...If he hadn't met Shannon, `
`...the man called Ushiromiya George would probably have lived a very different life. `
`And the George of that different life surely wouldn't have been as excellent a man as he is now. `
`The person I am now exists for Shannon's sake... `
`...Now that Shannon is gone, `
`...why do I exist? `
`It's completely meaningless, isn't it? `
`...He felt a deep, deep sadness, as though he himself had become empty. `
`That feeling must have been tormenting him this whole time. `
`...However, until Battler mentioned it, he hadn't been aware of the feeling himself. `
`...He'd finally managed to remember...that it should have been all right for him to cry much, much more. `
`So he cried. `
`Just like Battler had, he cried himself dry. `
`...By now, his eyes were bright red and swollen, and he couldn't cry any more. `
`So George did his best to change his way of thinking. `
`He was not meaningless now, ...and he should be grateful to Shannon for giving him such a character. `
`The dead don't come back to life. `
`He would have to get over being separated from his most beloved person. `
`If he were to chase after Shannon and kill himself, she would surely be deeply dejected. `
`...It worked the other way around, too. `
`If he had died, and Shannon had chased after him, throwing away her own life, he wouldn't have been able to forgive himself. `
`...So he chose to surpass his sadness and anger... `
`...and decided to thank her instead. `
`After meeting Shannon, she made his days rich and full... `
`and taught him the meaning of working hard for other people's sakes. `
`As a result, she had shaped him into the kind of person he had wanted to be. `
`...He wanted to thank her for that. `
`He tried to quell his sadness in this way, `
`but each time he did, he remembered Shannon's smile... `
`......He understood it logically. `
`He knew that grieving any more than this would only make her grieve in heaven, `
`...but that didn't bring a stop to his sadness... `
`"Why is it... `
`...that when people die... `
`it's so sad like this...?" `
`Battler muttered. `
`...It was as though he was speaking on behalf of all humans. `
`His question probably hadn't been directed at anyone, but Jessica answered. `
`"...It's always sad when you have to say goodbye. `
`...But when the person's old or there's some time, `
`...when you know beforehand that it's coming, sooner or later, `
`that sadness gets spread out over a long period of time. `
`...When misfortune comes suddenly, it's sad...because you don't even get that time..." `
`"......I see. `
`So, if they get sick or something and end up bedridden in a hospital, you might be able to ready yourself for it bit by bit, `
`...but when it happens suddenly someday, you don't get that luxury." `
`"...The sadness that's usually spread out over several years...closes in on you all at once. `
`......That's pretty tough. `
`...Sometimes, it makes you feel a sadness so deep, it can leave scars for life..." `
`"...Scars for life, huh?" `
`"...Like Grandfather's occult hobby. `
`People say that's what caused it. `
`...That {f:5:Beatrice}, his mistress, died a long time ago, and he was so sad that he couldn't pull himself together. `
`...Some people whisper... `
`that this is why he started sacrificing the rest of his life to occult research, in order to revive the dead." `
`"If that's true, Grandfather succeeded in that miracle in his last moments. `
`...The culprit is the revived {f:5:Beatrice}, and Grandfather was reunited with her at the moment he was killed. `
`Pretty ironic that he revived her, and then got killed by her." `
`"......Even so, Grandfather probably managed to meet her. `
`...He gambled half of his life and, even though it was only for a short time, `
`he was reunited with the woman he wished to see once again." `
`"...Then he got totally roasted though. `
`Feels like that result doesn't quite add up to the cost of researching for half his life." `
`"That's not true. `
`......Even if it was only for an instant, `
`...Grandfather must have been happy to be reunited with the woman he loved." `
`"......And that would be true...even if his crime of going against divine providence was punished by God, `
`and his body was burnt and sent down to hell, `
`...even if that reunion only lasted a very short time, right...?" `
`"George nii-san..." `
`"...I wouldn't care I met with the wrath of God and had my body burned. `
`......Even if it was just for a short amount of time, `
`...if I could revive Shannon again, `
`.........I would sacrifice the rest of my life to the same research as Grandfather. `
`...I want to talk with Shannon again, `
`...even if it's only for five minutes... `
`...Even one minute would be fine... `
`...In exchange, ...I wouldn't mind...sacrificing the rest of my life...!" `
`"......Aniki..." `
`When Battler and Jessica realized that their pointless discussion was causing George pain, they could do nothing more than shut their mouths... `
`...George directed his thoughts to Kinzo's life. `
`He sacrificed half his life to research that no one understood. `
`...And, on the last day of his life, he revived the person he loved most, `
`...and probably succeeded in his reunion in his final moments. `
`George didn't know how much time they'd had together. `
`...He didn't know if they'd been given an hour...or just five minutes. `
`However, ...that moment must have been enough to reward him for all those months of research. `
`...Even though he spent dozens of years to achieve it, that small amount of time was probably more than worth it to him. `
`Until today, I never believed in the occult or magic or anything. `
`Somewhere in my heart, `
`...I even made fun of Grandfather's research, thinking of it as nothing more than a pastime. `
`However, `
`...I won't make fun of it anymore. `
`...No, to the contrary, I'll believe strongly that it's real. `
`...If the power of belief can create miracles, `
`I'll probably throw away all of my studies up until today, `
`spending the rest of my life from today onwards studying magic. `
`......Give me the power of magic. `
`...And give me a miracle that'll let me see Shannon again... `
`"............ `
`...Haha, ...ha. `
`...Sorry, you two. `
`What am I talking about? `
`...If you could revive the dead with magic, `
`...people would probably be researching it everywhere around the world. `
`...But things like that don't exist in reality. `
`No one researches it. `
`......That's because...they know the dead can't be revived with magic. `
`......Sorry for saying something so weird. `
`It's my fault that the atmosphere here has gotten so strange. `
`...Sorry for making you tiptoe around me, even though this is tough for us all." `
`...Even if I did it to divert myself from my sadness, maybe I did say something strange. `
`If I keep talking about stuff that's so weird, I'm sure it won't do anything good for their sadness... `
`But...that doesn't mean I can bear this silence. `
`"...I'll go downstairs and get another cup of coffee. `
`...Mom's very particular about how she likes hers. `
`Does anyone else want a refill?" `
`Battler-kun and Jessica-chan lightly shook their heads. `
`Without pressing them any further, I took my mug and left the room. `
`The shutters were all closed in the hallway, so the corridor was very dim. `
`I tried visiting Doctor Nanjo's room and asking if he wanted more coffee, `
`but he said he didn't need any either. `
`...It seems my mother's orthodox method of making coffee isn't universally appreciated. `
`One time, I made some for Shannon, `
`...but she told me that while it was delicious, it was a little strong... `
`......Shannon...... `
`That's no good... `
`...Even though I left the room to change my mood, `
`...that image of Shannon's face filling my head hasn't faded in the slightest... `
`I keep seeing those fun days with her, more and more vividly, `
`......and it's saddening that I never even got a chance to see her dead face. `
`According to our parents, she was apparently killed with something like a gun or a spear. `
`...I'm sure they were just trying to console me, ...but they had said her dead face had been very beautiful and peaceful. `
`I wonder if she had the engagement ring I gave her last night...on her finger. `
`...If she accepted my engagement, she should have had it on the ring finger of her left hand... `
`Last night, we were both on the edge of losing it and not calm at all. `
`Shannon accepted my engagement pretty courageously, `
`but she might have regretted that as a rash action once she cooled her head. `
`She might have taken the ring off. `
`...I wonder if she has the ring on now. `
`...I want to be sure of at least that much. `
`I want to know how she felt...at the very end... `
`But...even if I do confirm that, ...it doesn't mean she'll come back. `
`......I wonder what will happen to her body. `
`After the autopsy, ...it will probably be immediately cremated. `
`Then, I'll never be able to see her face, ...even her dead face, for all eternity... `
`"...... `
`...Haha, ...has the shock of losing Shannon... `
`made me go a little crazy...?" `
`I don't want...her body to be burned. `
`If she's burned and turned to ash, ...never again {i:will it be possible for her to revive}. `
`They say cremation is frowned upon in Western tradition. `
`...Because on the day of resurrection, there would be no body to revive. `
`Because of that, it seems that great criminals in Western history were often cremated after execution as a punishment, `
`and their ashes were sometimes scattered in rivers and such... `
`In other words, to Western people, death is nothing more than a sleep until the resurrection. `
`It is essential that the corpse is left after death. `
`"In other words, `
`that's because... `
`...Western people... `
`......knew of a miracle that can revive the dead. `
`.........But that miracle didn't exist in Japan, so we burn them." `
`Now I understand. `
`...I understand why Grandfather idolized the Western occult. `
`That was his only reason from the very beginning. `
`...Just to revive the person dear to him, ...Grandfather spent the rest of his remaining life researching the Western occult. `
`......The situation surrounding us now is abnormal. `
`Grandfather did revive his beloved {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`...And, that {f:5:Beatrice} has carried out a terrible serial murder, `
`with linked closed rooms that force us to conclude that magic was used. `
`...The Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`The incarnation of the miracle of the Western occult. `
`......And also, the culprit who killed Shannon... `
`She's an entity I should hate, ......and yet, for some reason, I want to cling to her. `
`I wonder...if Shannon could be revived with the magic of miracles, which Grandfather bet his life on... `
`According to the legend of the Ushiromiya family, Grandfather met with her long ago and was given a vast quantity of gold. `
`...Then, if I also met with her, `
`...instead of gold, would she give me Shannon's life? `
`As collateral, I don't care what sort of devil's contract she imposed. `
`I wouldn't mind sacrificing all of my remaining life... `
`George probably couldn't believe or realize that his voiceless wish... `
`was heard by the witch herself, who stood right behind him. `
`{f:5:Beatrice} had been listening to that entire discussion between the children just now in the cousins' room. `
`...Battler had told her that she didn't know the value of a human's life, `
`...and wanting to understand that in her own way, she had stealthily visited, listening in on their discussion. `
`"......... `
`...That is your wish, you say...? `
`If I could grant that, would I be accepted as a witch...?" `
`Beato looked at the palms of both of her hands. `
`...She had handed over most of her once-surging magical power when the new witch succeeded the name of the Endless Witch. `
`Of course, her current power still made her worthy of being called a witch, `
`...but it could not begin to compare to her previous strength. `
`"...Hmm. `
`Even without the Endless Magic, I am a Great Witch whose name has been thundered for a thousand years. `
`Reviving the dead will be no trouble at all." `
`Inside her head, she thought about several magical steps she could take to revive the dead. `
`...Even magic that should have been easy in the past would be difficult with her current power. `
`She thought of something, then clicked her tongue, then did so again, over and over. `
`In the end, ...she finally thought of a single spell. `
`But that was a spell that she couldn't use by herself. `
`It was a spell that witches with weak power used, one that relied on the aid of others. `
`...In the past, Beato had looked down upon that type of magic. `
`Therefore, she frantically tried to search for any conceivable alternative, `
`......but in the end, she couldn't think of one and slumped over in self-derision. `
`Then, ...careful not to surprise him, she softly called out. `
`Softly, to George's heart... `
`"......Ushiromiya George, `
`...can you hear my voice...?" `
`"...I can hear you. `
`...Who are you...? `
`Are you really the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}...? `
`...Or are you an illusion created by my sorrow...?" `
`"......If it's the former, please hear my wish. `
`...And if it's the latter, just leave me alone..." `
`Their conversation in a mental world was a lot like having one in a dream. `
`When you dream, haven't you ever had the experience... `
`of casually accepting something that would've been absurd in the real world? `
`...The conversation in this world was like that. `
`So even though a witch appeared and started talking to George, he was not surprised... `
`"Indeed. `
`...I am...the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`......Normally, you and I would not be able to talk together in this manner. `
`...However, you are strongly conscious of me and wish to have a discussion, `
`...so both of our channels are able to match like this." `
`"......I don't care if the person who killed Shannon was you... `
`or someone else using your name. `
`...As long as you exist as a real witch..." `
`"......I'll pay whatever cost you ask for. `
`If you desire my life, take it right now. `
`...Please, I want you to bring Shannon back to life... `
`......If that's impossible, I'd be satisfied if you'd just let me talk to her for a short while... `
`...Please......" `
`"......I ask for nothing in return. `
`I shall grant that wish." `
`"...Really...? `
`Really, you'll revive Shannon......?" `
`"Indeed. `
`...However, my current magical power is not sufficient to use the magic of resurrection. `
`...Therefore, I must rely on your help." `
`"......If there's anything I can do, I'll do it. `
`...Even if that means taking my heart out right here and now, I will not hesitate..." `
`"...I told you, I don't need anything like that. `
`......I will chant the magic. `
`Then, a gap will open in the door to the Land of the Dead." `
`"...But as I am now, I do not have the power to bring Shannon's soul up through that gap. `
`......However, you have strong feelings for Shannon, `
`and those feelings will surely become magic that can bring her soul out without fail." `
`"...What do you say? `
`Will you help me...?" `
`"...I will. `
`......If Shannon's life will be restored, `
`...there's nothing I'm afraid to lose...!" `
`George's fists shook in silence. `
`...Then, he slowly came to his senses. `
`He had been absent-mindedly standing near the window in the hall that whole time, his mug still in his hand... `
`And... `
`......the witch from his dream...was still there. `
`"Wh...What the... ......I-It isn't...a dream......" `
`"...Be quiet. `
`I am very fragile now. `
`If any more Humans appear, I will not be able to preserve this form. `
`...I shall grant your wish, so stay silent for now. `
`...Understand?" `
`George covered his mouth with both hands, nodding enthusiastically several times. `
`In that instant, he almost dropped the mug he was holding. `
`George frantically juggled it around and caught it. `
`...He was afraid that if it fell to the floor and made a loud sound, `
`the witch's form might disappear like a bubble popping. `
`He softly set the mug on the floor...and stared at the witch in front of him again. `
`......Her form didn't disappear. `
`It wasn't a dream... `
`"Come, let us go to the parlor where Shannon sleeps. `
`With the power of your feelings, we will bring back her soul." `
`"Y-You say go, but how...? `
`My mother and the rest are downstairs. `
`There's no way they'd let us go outside. `
`...And...didn't you just say that you wouldn't be able to preserve your form if another Human appeared?" `
`"...Come to think of it, that is true. `
`So, Krauss and the rest are downstairs. `
`...In that case, we definitely cannot go down. `
`...Well then, we just need to go to the mansion without going down to the first floor, right? `
`It's simple." `
`Beato laughed, as though she had thought of a pleasant prank. `
`...And with her golden pipe, she lightly tapped a window with its shutter closed. `
`When she did, three gold butterflies appeared from the pipe and opened the lock on the window as though melting it. `
`Then, the window opened without a sound. `
`The shutter beyond it was exactly the same. `
`The clasp unset itself, also without making a sound, and it quietly opened. `
`The window opened, exposing the wind and rain outside the mansion. `
`...Perhaps because of the direction or something related to the construction of the building, the wind did not blow inside. `
`Because of that, for a while, `
`George felt as though this entrance that opened to the outside was a dream or an illusion, and he couldn't accept it as real. `
`"Come, let us go. `
`Come with me." `
`Beato gently floated upwards. `
`It was a natural action, like that of a diver enjoying an underwater stroll. `
`...It made it easy to believe that if you acted like she did, `
`you too might be able to float in the sky just as though you were swimming through the water. `
`...No, George did believe that. `
`...So without thinking, just as she had done, he also... `
`...gently, `
`...as though swimming in the water, lifted his feet... `
`"...Ah, ......aaaaaaahh......" `
`"Hoh. `
`...Not bad. `
`So, you learned how to dance in the sky faster than I could explain it." `
`George was shocked to find himself floating in midair like he was swimming. `
`...Of course, Beato was also shocked that George, who shouldn't have been able to use magic, had figured out how to do that just by instinct. `
`"......To be able to... `
`...fly in the air, `
`...to swim in the air..." `
`"...You mustn't be bound by reason. `
`Accept it as a natural thing. `
`...You mustn't fall back to your Human doctrines, such as those of Newton and Einstein." `
`"Especially when flying high in the sky. `
`...Inexperienced witches sometimes plummet to the earth." `
`"...I-I accept things for what they appear to be... `
`I-I accept things for what they appear to be..." `
`George repeated those words over and over. `
`...He must not deny magic, no matter what. `
`Denying that would be like throwing away what might be `
`his first and last chance to revive Shannon. `
`However, compared to Beato, who was elegantly drifting like smoke, George's movements clearly resembled someone underwater. `
`...Therefore, if he didn't act like he was kicking his feet in water every once in a while, he'd be caught by the force of gravity bit by bit. `
`"I must say you're doing better than when I first danced through the sky. `
`...Here we go. `
`Come with me." `
`When Beato beckoned to George, she gently flew into the stormy sky. `
`...It was just like a scene from a fairy tale. `
`The scene unfolding before George's eyes felt entirely like an extension of his dream. `
`"...Being able to fly is...incredible, ...but so is the wind and the rain..." `
`"What's this? Are the wind and rain tormenting you...? `
`...I could teach you magic to block against that, `
`but it may be too early for you, and it may be a misuse of time right now." `
`".........Yes. `
`...The magic I need...isn't that." `
`George wore a strong-willed gaze, refusing to let the wind and rain get to him. `
`"The mansion is coming into sight. `
`...Hold out just a little longer. `
`If you fall now, you'll hit the bushes in the rose garden." `
`The undulating rose garden was spread beneath the witch and George's gazes. `
`This illusion-like scene no longer surprised George. `
`Only the gradually approaching mansion was reflected in his eyes. `
`"Shannon, ......wait for me... `
`...I will definitely...revive you...!" `
`At that time, `
`...the cruel new witch could be seen staring at the guesthouse from a different location. `
`"......Now, all that's left is the seventh and eighth twilights. `
`Just two more, and my obligation to that old hag Predecessor is finished. `
`......I'll kill Krauss and Natsuhi. `
`Let them die together like the good couple they are." `
`"Nihi. `
`Where's the target nyeh?" `
`"...In the lobby on the first floor of the guesthouse, two targets and Ushiromiya Eva identified. `
`Measuring Anti-Magic Power Levels. `
`Data Link to 410." `
`"410, Data Received. `
`Anti-magic power levels are extremely low. `
`If Eva just goes outside, they're tuna and abalone on a chopping board. `
`Nihihihihi...!" `
`"What do you think, Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}? `
`When you give the order, we shall snipe right away...! `
`Please, your orders...!" `
`"...You guys reeeally are convenient furniture. `
`Not at all like that old, second-hand furniture that's only useful for gouging corpses. `
`Right?" `
`"............Nn..." `
`"Chiester Sisters, please show me your skill once more. `
`...Prepare to fire! `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*! `
`And carry out the corpses again, got it? `
`'Cause I'll play with them a lot. `
`No complaints from you, right, Ronove?" `
`"...Correct. `
`As you command." `
`"Nn..." `
`At that moment, the witch noticed something. `
`...It was as though some presence had disappeared... `
`...Was it her imagination...? `
`"......Was that someone's presence just now? `
`Did anyone feel it?" `
`"M-My apologies, I haven't noticed anything, ...so please forgive me...!!" `
`"We were in the middle of observing the guesthouse, so our peripheral surveillance was set to off. Nihi. `
`...What about you, Lucifer-chaaan? `
`Did you feel any presence?" `
`"......Nn-" `
`For just an instant, Lucifer glanced at Ronove, asking whether she should answer honestly or not. `
`Ronove gave a small nod in response. `
`"No. `
`...My apologies, {f:5:Beatrice}-sama. `
`We noticed nothing. `
`......Forgive us the stupidity of us second-hand furniture." `
`"............" `
`"............" `
`"............ `
`...I see. `
`If a great demon like you says that, then it must've been my imagination." `
`The witch persistently stared in the direction the presence had disappeared to. `
`...That was where the rose garden lay. `
`And beyond that, she could see the mansion's dark silhouette creating by lightning. `
`...It took quite some time before she pushed her unsatisfied feelings aside... `
`and once again faced the guesthouse. `
