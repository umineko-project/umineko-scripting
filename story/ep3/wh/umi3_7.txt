`Gohda was doing the nighttime rounds. `
`Rokkenjima had always been empty, except for the Ushiromiya Family household. `
`So, checking that the doors and windows were all closed had no real purpose. `
`However, ever since the time Natsuhi had condemned such an attitude as being careless, the nighttime rounds had become part of the servants' daily routine. `
`...In the first place, Natsuhi had ordered this because of the occasional witch disturbances. `
`Everyone who came and left this island knew about the legend of Beatrice, the witch of the forest. `
`It had become established as this island's characteristic ghost story. `
`Because of that, it was only natural that some people would claim that, when they thought they were alone in the mansion, `
`...they would hear a strange sound or see the shadow of a person. `
`However, when that created a little too much of a disturbance and reached Natsuhi's ears, `
`she made a fuss, thinking that some suspicious person might have been entering and leaving. `
`Apparently, she had roused all the servants and had them check throughout the mansion. `
`Because all of that panic over the witch had happened before Gohda's arrival, `
`he had only heard about it from the more senior servants. `
`Ghost stories like that could be found in any workplace. `
`Even at the hotels and restaurants Gohda had worked at, `
`there had been plenty of them. `
`So when he heard about that story on this island, `
`he'd given a forced smile, thinking 'Ah, so they have that kind of thing here after all'. `
`That forced smile aside, he had figured that, when in Rome, do as the Romans do, and had taken it seriously. `
`Gohda went along with it on the outside, but in his heart, he'd assumed it to be a childish trick. `
`...At first, that is. `
`"......This certainly is eerie. `
`Yes, I can see why it was so easy for past servants to get into a panic." `
`He could understand how someone doing the rounds on an eerie night like this... `
`might believe they'd seen a ghost if they `
`saw a lace curtain waving in the breeze from a window that hadn't been closed. `
`"So, if you make fun of the witch of the portrait, there is a curse. `
`...It seems there was even a servant who received a serious injury and quit. `
`...Well, I wouldn't want that. `
`Think of my age. `
`I probably wouldn't be granted a workplace this hospitable again... `
`Aaah. `
`Witch of the portrait, `
`I'm working sincerely, so please give me some peace." `
`Gohda prayed to the portrait, his hands together, as though he was at a Shinto shrine... `
`At that time, ...he thought he heard a sound. `
`The kitchen? `
`Was that the sound of something metal falling on the floor? `
`Maybe a mouse or a cockroach had come out and knocked over some of the dishes. `
`No, no, how could that be? `
`It was usually cleaned thoroughly! `
`Thinking he'd check out what that noise really had been, Gohda entered the kitchen. `
`He turned on the kitchen light. `
`When he did, he heard a strange sound. `
`*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*. `
`...To a cook like Gohda, the sound felt like the lid on a pressure cooker or something shaking. `
`Surely, there wouldn't be a pot on the burner when no one was in the kitchen. `
`Even if someone was using the gas, walking away from it would be quite dangerous. `
`...Just in case, Gohda decided to inspect the area around the gas range... `
`"......What is this...?" `
`When he did, in the corner with the gas range, `
`...the pressure cooker really had been set out, just as he'd thought. `
`But the flame wasn't on. `
`...And yet, the lid was clanking... `
`Was something fermenting and leaking gas? `
`...How could that be? `
`...Then was there a mouse or something inside? `
`...How could there be? Ridiculous... `
`When people were watching, Gohda acted as though he had a bold personality fitting for his build, `
`...but he actually had an unexpectedly timid side to him. `
`He was frightened that there might be something inside, and he couldn't bring himself to check it carelessly... `
`In his cowardice, ...he grabbed a nearby wooden pestle, `
`and with a *clunk!* `
`he tapped it a little forcefully against the side of the pressure cooker. `
`When he did, the clanking sound suddenly stopped. `
`...He should've been relieved that it had stopped, `
`...but the fact that it had stopped when he'd hit it was even more eerie, and made him even more suspicious about what was inside... `
`"......Hmm, ...*gulp*. `
`......Mysterious phenomena do not exist in this world. `
`Yes, witches and magic, things like that couldn't possibly exist. `
`All phenomena can be explained with science. `
`...As if monsters and witches could exist...!" `
`He repeated that many times, trying to build up his own confidence. `
`...The gap between what he was saying and what he was doing was quite comical. `
`"Who would believe in a witch, who would believe in magic or curses...? `
`...Come on, `
`...show me what you really are...! `
`Take that!" `
`...He removed the lid of the pressure cooker. `
`And lying exposed there... `
`was the sparkling clean silver bottom of the pot. `
`...There was absolutely nothing frightening like he'd imagined. `
`"......Whew. `
`...Hahahaha, it's only natural. `
`...There's no way there could have been anything inside." `
`By now, Gohda realized that he had been a coward. `
`...So, while he still had some doubts as to what had caused the lid to make that sound, `
`...he figured it wasn't a big problem, and decided not to worry about it too much. `
`Then he took the lid he'd grabbed...and softly set it back down where it had been. `
`...It's fine, it won't make a sound. `
`...Of course it won't. `
`As if witches or magic could exist...! `
`*clank*. `
`*clank*clank*clank*clank*. `
`"......Huh...?" `
`*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*. `
`*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*clank*! `
`"...E-Eeeeeeeeeeeppp!!" `
`All of the pots and dishes in the kitchen started clanking at once. `
`It grew even stronger, so that finally, the lid to one of the pots fell off...! `
`And...from inside that pot, ......a slender white arm reached out. `
`Lids fell off the other pots one after another, `
`and another, `
`and another... `
`"Eeeeeeeeeepp!!! `
`As if...as if witches could exiiiist!! `
`As if I'd believe iiiiiiiiiit!!" `
`When the number of arms grew to seven, a loud, shrill laughter split the air. `
`"What a letdown! `
`Too bad that someone who can make such delicious food is such a lightweight!!" `
`"If you don't want him, I'll take him, he's all mine!!" `
`"Wait, I said nooooooooooo!! `
`I'll take him!!" `
`"Huh?! `
`Wha, whaa?!?! `
`HYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!" `
`""""Kyahahahahahahaha!!!"""" `
`Come on, let's search, there's only one more. `
`That old hag! `
`Where is she? `
`She isn't in the mansion, what about the guesthouse? `
`Kuhihihihi, first one wins, first one wins, right?! `
`Come on, search, search, find her, find her...! `
`Don't be noticed by the relatives in the dining hall, right? `
`And don't get noticed by the kids in the guesthouse, right? `
`Search in silence, kill in silence! `
`After all, it's still just the first twilight! `
`She isn't in the guesthouse. `
`But she wasn't in the mansion either, right? `
`Hey, hey, I found her, I found her, she's in the rose garden. `
`Why's she standing around there without an umbrella? `
`She's already given up, all mine, all mine, all miiine! `
`You blockheads can just sit there and watch! `
`I told you, nooooooo, this one's miiiiiiiiiiiiine!! `
`Come on, if we take any longer, we'll be scolded by Beatrice-sama! `
`Let's take care of it all at once! `
`"............" `
`There, found her, surrounded her! `
`Come on, let's get along and do it all at once, okay?! `
`Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiie!!! `
`"......Huuuh...? `
`......What?" `
`"Wh‚Äê `
`What is... `
`this...?" `
`"......Hohohohoh. `
`What naughty girls. `
`...You wouldn't happen to be friends of that child, would you...?" `
`"...Just what is this......this old hag...?!" `
`"There's got to be some mistake!! `
`One more time!!" `
`"...Why can she defend against us?!" `
`"Move aside! `
`One more time!!!" `
`"......No matter how often you try, it won't work. `
`This person...is good." `
`"......I am waiting for that child. `
`Would you mind calling for her?" `
`"D-Do you really expect us to run errands for you like that?!" `
`"There's no need." `
`"Beatrice-sama...!" `
`"......After all, even I have manifested by now. `
`...I was certain that you had awakened." `
`"Ronove, `
`it's been a long time. `
`...Yes, truly, a long time." `
`"This person's talking to Ronove-sama without using 'sama'...!" `
`".........And... `
`it's been a long time since I've seen you too, `
`...Beatrice." `
`"Sh-She's not even using 'sama' for Beatrice-sama..." `
`"Enough. `
`Don't you know who this is? `
`...The name 'Beatrice' itself is hers. `
`I only inherited it from her. `
`...This is my teacher, `
`the previous Lady Beatrice." `
`"The previous... `
`Lady Beatrice..." `
`Gold butterflies appeared in ones and twos from the garden of roses and began to gather around Kumasawa... `
`Then, after she was wrapped in a golden sparkle, she burst and disappeared, and Kumasawa's form was no longer there. `
`...Instead, there was another Golden Witch, ......the one who once taught the path of an Endless Witch to Beatrice, `
`and the only person Beatrice ever called Teacher. `
`Her hair was long, beautiful, and vividly youthful, `
`and her figure in that elegant dress couldn't possibly have been mistaken for an old lady... `
`No, this looked like a completely different person from Kumasawa. `
`"......Well, well, Teacher. `
`I never even dreamed that we would meet each other again." `
`"Yes, neither did I. `
`...I certainly never dreamed that my sleep would be disturbed." `
`"Such a troublesome time for you to awaken. `
`...If you'd remained asleep as usual, the first twilight could have ended without much trouble. `
`...Or perhaps I should be glad you're here. `
`......I was just getting a tad bored." `
`"...As usual, it seems you're toying with sinless people in a vulgar game. `
`...I believe I taught you several times that the power of the Endless Witch mustn't be used to cause people trouble." `
`"Don't say that, Teacher. `
`Isn't boredom our natural enemy? `
`This is just a little spice to escape from that." `
`"......Tch. `
`The more the corrosion advances, the stronger my power becomes, and the easier it becomes to summon my minions. `
`...But who would have thought it would release the seal on you, Teacher, at the same time..." `
`"It's precisely because I predicted such a thing would happen... `
`that I slept so very close to where you were. `
`...Though, I prayed in my sleep that I would not be woken again." `
`"...Being reunited with you like this is a very sad thing for me." `
`".........You're as cunning as always, Teacher... `
`*cackle*..." `
`"Ronove, `
`have that young furniture step back. `
`Furniture only serves its master. `
`The master is responsible for all of her crimes." `
`"......Certainly, `
`Madam Beatrice." `
`"I have already passed that name on to this child. `
`...Come now, step back, `
`furniture girls. `
`...I may give warnings a second time, if you did not listen to the first. `
`However, do not expect to receive a third..." `
`"...Step back, Seven Sisters of Purgatory. `
`If you get dragged into this, only dust will remain..." `
`"...B-Back, everyone..." `
`Ronove and the Seven Sisters of Purgatory retreated. `
`After that, what remained was the Beatrice whose daring expression didn't falter... `
`and the teacher Beatrice, who had given up that name and wore a composed smile... `
`"Well then, `
`...Teacher, `
`what tea shall I prepare for our long-awaited reunion?" `
`"Let's see. `
`This reunion was longer in coming than the visit of a comet. `
`Perhaps I will accept your hospitality. `
`......And if it seems a mistake has been made, `
`...I'll have you return my name and the title of Endless Witch." `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`So, even the title of Endless Witch has a license renewal policy? `
`...As you wish, Teacher. `
`See how splendid your disciple has become, `
`and see how far she surpassed you so long ago...!" `
`The air between the two Beatrices seemed to explode with sparks. `
`Just by glaring at each other, they purged all spirits from that space. `
`...As they watched, the Seven Sisters shivered. `
`...After all, if they had retreated just three steps less than they had, they would already have been turned to dust by now. `
`"So come, `
`Beatrice. `
`...Surrendering my name to you is the only regret I have in life. `
`I will now correct that error by my own hands!" `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*... `
`...Tsk, tsk, tsk. `
`...You've got it wrong, Teacheer. `
`My only error... `
`was becoming your disciple in the hopes of gaining such a puny level of power, get iiiiiiiit?" `
`"What are you calling magic? `
`What are you calling the Endless Witch? `
`...All you've got is a power that can be gained just by noticing, right? `
`And you act as though that's so great and impressive. `
`Your turn's long over, Teacheeeeeeeeeeeeer!!" `
`"......I... `
`I-I don't have a clue what's going on anymore...! `
`What in the world is happening right in front of my eyes...?!" `
`"...You poor thing. `
`It seems my disciple is causing you trouble. `
`I apologize." `
`"Wh-Who the heck are you...? `
`Why did old Kumasawa turn into a nee-chan like this?! `
`I mean, seriously, who are you?! `
`I don't get it! `
`What kind of special effects are these?! `
`My head feels like it's gonna explode!!" `
`"I am the witch teacher of that child. `
`My old name was Beatrice. `
`When that child succeeded me, I gave up that name, so I have no name of my own." `
`"Like you've already said, your disciple's been a real pain to me! `
`Please, take responsibility and do something! `
`No, wait!!" `
`"I don't believe in stuff like this!! `
`As if witches and magic could exist!! `
`I won't accept this messed-up battle! `
`Dammit, what should I believe?!!" `
`"Hohohoh... `
`That's just like you, hospitality with a very quick temper." `
`"...*cackle*cackle* `
`I'd expect nothing less from you, Teacher. `
`It seems this is so trivial to you, you don't even feel like opening your eyes...! `
`But I doubt you'll be able to win unless you're prepared to wreck this whole island, seeeeeeee? `
`Come, arise, Shoulder War Towers!!" `
`In response to Beatrice's summons, a terrific earth tremor split the rose garden. `
`And on either side of her shoulders, two massive War Towers sprouted and stabbed into the heavens. `
`They stretched up to 100 {c:86Ef9C:merute} tall, and each had over 360 ports. `
`They were War Towers of the gods' army corps, which had prevented even groups of ancient heroes from invading their sacred grounds. `
`As Beatrice elegantly floated in the gap between the massive two-headed towers, she looked down on her teacher, sneering with a sense of absolute superiority. `
`With the two massive towers lined up behind her shoulders, the witch looked very small, `
`like a butterfly dancing between huge trees. `
`"Hihhyahhyahhyaaaaaa!! `
`Don't think you can dodge it by turning into butterflies, okay? `
`The density of the twin towers' barrage wouldn't just make you a pinned bug sample, it'd make you a madly stabbed pincushion, right...?" `
`Over 720 ports opened on the towers, and godly soldiers readied their multi-shot ballistas. `
`"Is that the end of your turn?" `
`"Heh, famous last words!! `
`Blast awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!!" `
`The ballista shots that numbered over a thousand were all fired at once, drawing a beautiful geometric curtain of death. `
`The boorish sound as the bowstrings were played was probably even deeper than that of a reaper swinging its sickle. `
`"Come, arise, Fallen Tower. `
`Split the single language and let that sin be known." `
`The sky was stained an incandescent red, and from between the clouds, a blazing, massive tower fell upside down. `
`That massive falling tower and its rubble... `
`sucked in the thousands of ballista shots, so that not one of them approached the body of the witch who had summoned it. `
`That's right, no group of people, no matter how large, could approach the mysteries of heaven. `
`That was the reality of the fallen tower. `
`"As I'd expect from you, Teacher! `
`If you do something, you always do it big!! `
`Khehhhuhuhuhuhyahyahya!!" `
`"My turn isn't over. `
`Come, arise, Sons of Ivaldi. `
`Bestow upon me a worthy spear." `
`As the massive crimson tower that had fallen made a terrible gold-colored explosion, `
`a massive spear appeared from inside those flames, so tall, like a tower, that you had to look up to see all of it. `
`...It was too large even for a giant's hand. `
`That divinely beautiful Spear of the Gods was so massive, it gave the illusion that the fallen tower had turned into a spear of the same size. `
`It was a spear of certain victory that none could escape. `
`"Looks like your twin towers won't help you now. `
`How foolish, to block off your means of escape on both sides. `
`You can't defend against even a single spear!" `
`When she snapped her fingers in command, `
`the massive tower-sized spear shot at Beatrice like a lightning bolt. `
`It aimed right for the middle of the center of the Golden Witch's heart with extreme precision, `
`as she danced in the gap between the towers like a butterfly, `
`slicing straight through the air like a flash of lightning. `
`"Hah!! `
`So, you use Gungnir at a moment like this!! `
`You really are incredible, Teacheeeeeer!!" `
`"Burst, useless towers! `
`Arise, Giant Soldier Battle Line. `
`Fully block that divine spear with your shields and chests!!" `
`The Shoulder War Towers exploded in gold. `
`They became several billion gold butterflies. `
`Those butterflies took the shape of seven massive armored soldiers. `
`Each stretched a full 50 merute into the sky, `
`and they lined up in front of Beatrice, protecting their master and holding massive shields that towered like windmills. `
`They were as massive as a mountain range. `
`The witch behind them was like a small moon hiding behind the mountains. `
`Once in the past, when the massive shields these giants held had been readied by the whole regiment, `
`they had protected King Whilhelm's castle not only from arrows, but from the wind and the rain, `
`for when they had faced upwards and held their shields to the heavens, not a single raindrop had gotten through. `
`"Foolish. `
`The shame of a witch who has forgotten to respect things sacred. `
`Did you think mere giants could defend against a Spear of the Gods?!" `
`"...Indeed. `
`No matter how much human metal you are armed with, you cannot block a Spear of the Gods. `
`A wonderful Epaulette Mate by Madam." `
`"No way! `
`Beatrice-sama?!!" `
`"Of course I haven't forgotten, Teacher! `
`Come arise, disciples of Hephaestus. `
`Bestow upon me a worthy shield!!" `
`A golden whirlwind arose at the feet of the Giant Soldiers. `
`It was a cloud of countless butterflies. `
`...They attached themselves to the massive shields like gold leaf, sparkling like they were a gold mirror. `
`It was the absolute defensive wall given to a goddess by the chief of the gods. `
`The Aegis Shield. `
`When the holy spear, which left a dignified tail behind it like a comet, crashed into the mountain range of that gold shield, `
`there was a terrible thunderous roar. `
`It was the creaking of the pillars that held up the heavens. `
`The Divine Spear spun around and around...and was sent flying in the direction of the setting sun. `
`"Impossible... `
`She defended against the Divine Spear...!!" `
`"No, that is not correct. `
`The divine spear avoided her. `
`It is the law of the gods that an absolute spear and an absolute shield must never fight one another. `
`Although, in the end, it means the same thing as defending against it." `
`".........Your skills have improved from engaging in these fights so often." `
`"Or rather, it seems you're still as bad as ever at this kind of game, Teacher. `
`It's my turn to strike back. `
`I shall follow the code and counter a spear with a spear." `
`The Giant Soldier Battle Line, which had fully blocked the Divine Spear, released its holy gold shields. `
`The shields fell to the earth, making the ground shake. `
`When they did, another gold whirlwind arose, `
`and the seven gold shields changed their form into seven massive spears of lightning lying on the ground. `
`At once, each of the giants lifted one of their legs high...and firmly stomped on the tips of the handles. `
`As the earth shook with a thunderous sound, the seven lightning spears spun beautifully and flew up above the Giant Soldiers' heads. `
`...They scattered into a golden splash and began to fall before the giants. `
`Each of the giants squared off, and with the force of their whole body, they kicked and smashed them. `
`The broken pieces numbered exactly 30, and became lightning spears of exactly the same size as the originals... `
`...Which made 210 for the 7 giants. And all of those burst at once, `
`with each splitting into 30 thorns, for a total of 6,300. `
`They became a barrage of thunderclouds drawing a beautiful geometric pattern, `
`and then each changed into three bolts of lightning, so that 18,900 thunderbolts shot at the Predecessor Beatrice. `
`"It's oveeeeer, `
`Beatrice-samaaa!!" `
`"I would expect nothing less... `
`from Madam." `
`That bundle of almost 20,000 thunderbolts must have reduced the teacher's body to dust. `
`But there had been no resistance. `
`Beatrice knew immediately that she had been fooled. `
`At that time, from the direction that the sun had supposedly set, she felt the impossible rays of sunlight. `
`A brilliant ray of light shone on her profile. `
`It was the figure of her teacher, holding aloft the Spear of the Gods that had supposedly been repelled a short while ago. `
`...She bore a sparkle like the sun on her back and made it shine on the incarnation of darkness. `
`...As Beatrice watched, `
`she was trapped like a mouse in a cage, cornered in a dead end formed by the Giant Soldier Battle Line. `
`By now, the Predecessor Beatrice had seized a position directly alongside that Line. `
`"Playtime is over, Beatrice...!" `
`"......Have I... `
`exposed my flaaaaank...?!" `
`Her bold expression hadn't faltered even once, but now it twisted for the first time. `
`And faster than Beatrice could click her tongue, the Predecessor Beatrice released the holy spear. `
`As it leapt through the air, it changed its form once more. `
`"Come, arise, Dvergar brothers. `
`Bestow upon me the giant-smashing Iron Hammer of heaven!" `
`"Giant soldiers, protect me!!! `
`What are you doing, you blockheads?!!!" `
`By now it was no longer a spear, but the whirlwind of a massive hammer that raised a sound like a windstorm as it flew through the air. `
`It was the legendary hammer that had shaken even the King of the Frost Giants. `
`So, the Giant Soldiers couldn't escape from that fear. `
`So, regardless of how strongly their master ordered them, they couldn't get in the path of that hammer. `
`"Back Rank Mate! `
`Rest in peace." `
`"...Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit...!!!" `
`Before the whirlwind of that massive chunk of metal, Beatrice was nothing more than a mere speck. `
`The instant the whirlwind started to suck Beatrice in, she appeared to change into a massive War Tower. `
`The Iron Hammer smashed the War Tower, scattering tremendous amounts of rubble, but it did not reach she who had escaped behind it. `
`Furthermore, when the smoke started to settle, the War Tower had sucked in the massive Iron Hammer without crumbling, and blocked the way. `
`Even the giant-smashing Iron Hammer couldn't break through the final tower protecting the witch. `
`However, this War Tower was actually the witch's last trump card. `
`It was a War Tower for dodging that could only save her from danger once. `
`But this tower was impregnable. `
`No weapon could break through it. `
`At that time, the moon disappeared. `
`As Beatrice hid in the shadows of the Giant Soldier Battle Line and the War Tower, she looked up at the sky. `
`When she did, inside the moon was the figure of a massive horse ridden by the god of war and death. `
`The Predecessor Beatrice rode the horse with him. `
`His cloak had blocked the moon and swallowed it in an eerie shadow. `
`And the Spear of the Gods was in his hand once more... `
`In other words, it was a godly knight who had jumped over the ramparts formed by the Giant Soldiers and the War Tower, attacking from the heavens. `
`"...*cackle*... `
`You got meee..." `
`"Smothered Mate. `
`It was fun, Beatrice!" `
`"Uuuooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!" `
`The struggle to the death between the two witches with the same name...was over. `
`The spear that had been launched from the heavens pierced the ground. `
`The Giant Soldier Battle Line and the War Tower split up into countless gold butterflies, wrapping the area in a gold-colored storm. `
`Then came the sound of thunder. `
`And the sound of the falling rain and wind. `
`If you looked around, the rose garden was empty. `
`...The butler and the rest were watching the two witches confronting each other. `
`......But Beatrice alone had changed. `
`She had been pierced straight through by the spear, from the base of her neck and her right shoulder to her left buttocks, `
`unable to even reach the ground with her feet, `
`...horribly exposed like a pitiful pinned butterfly, tormented by the wind and rain... `
`"......B-Beatrice-sama..." `
`"......... `
`As expected, `
`...a truly fearsome person." `
`"That settles it, `
`Beatrice." `
`"......Ku, `
`...hihihihi, `
`...ouch...ch..." `
`Beatrice wore a bitter smile of false courage, `
`but a strand of blood dangled from her mouth, making her look even more pitiful. `
`"The title and power of the Endless Witch. `
`You will return them to me now, along with the name Beatrice. `
`...You are too immature to call yourself an Endless Witch." `
`"......Stop... `
`Forgive me, Teacher... `
`I was just fooling around, okay...?" `
`"I will take my name back from you. `
`I shall return you to your original form. `
`Perhaps you should relinquish this power which is beyond you...and live a life suitable for yourself." `
`"......Come, try to remember. `
`What form did you have?" `
`The Predecessor Beatrice began to recite the words of power. `
`When she did, small gold butterflies gathered near the skewered Beatrice...and began to swarm about her. `
`Like butterflies sucking the nectar out of flowers... `
`...They began to suck the magical power out of Beatrice. `
`And it seemed to cause her intense pain. `
`A cry of anguish issued from Beatrice's mouth. `
`She no longer had any power to resist it... `
`"Come, try closing your eyes. `
`Try to remember. `
`What form did you have?" `
`"......Come, Beatrice. `
`Repeat it with me. `
`Let us sing a song together. `
`Then it will be over soon. `
`Let us end your pain as fast as possible." `
`"...Kuhihihi, `
`...ha, `
`...haha... `
`...You're right... `
`How long has it been... `
`...since I've sung with you, Teacher...?" `
`"Come, together now. `
`......Come, try to remember. `
`What form did you have?" `
`"...Come, try to remember. `
`What form did you have...?" `
`When the two of them began to recite the same song, `
`more and more gold butterflies danced around, swarming around Beatrice... `
`"......It will be all right, Milady. `
`You will lose your place as my disciple, `
`but that will not change the fact that you are the lady I serve." `
`"...After that, I shall read a book for you again. `
`I shall bake you apple pies once more. `
`Just like it was long ago. `
`...Come, try to remember." `
`"...Hahahahahaha... `
`Yes, try to remember. `
`...Are you finally starting to remember...? `
`......Hey, Teacher." `
`Did you remember... `
`that thing behind yooou...?" `
`"...What is... `
`............this...?" `
`When the Predecessor Beatrice looked behind her, `
`......there was an eerie hedgehog curled up there. `
`No. `
`...It was... `
`herself. `
`There was another Predecessor Beatrice, whose whole body had been packed with ballista shots, `
`...lying there like a pincushion doll... `
`"...Come, try to remember. `
`What form did you have? `
`...Or maybe that's not right." `
`"...Come, try to remember. `
`How were you killed? `
`...Kuhihihii, kuhyahhyahhyahhaaaaaaahh!!" `
`The Predecessor Beatrice was stunned. `
`...Her form gradually began to fade away... `
`"This is... `
`...When...did you......?" `
`"At the beginning, I did not summon a pair of Shoulder Towers. `
`There were four towers. `
`Teacher, you carelessly stepped across the Seventh Rank Rook boundary of death created by the two hidden towers, `
`which were lurking in the distance on either side of you." `
`"...It was bad manners of me to say check this late. `
`I simply must apologize. `
`...*cackle*cackle*cackle*!" `
`The battle had been decided at the very beginning. `
`It had been over since the time the Predecessor had leaned forward, readying her holy spear to attack Beatrice, who had been wedged between her Shoulder Towers. `
`...The hidden towers lurking on either side had bathed her in a windstorm of ballista shots from 720 ports on both sides, `
`pinning and killing her. `
`However, Beatrice hadn't wanted it to be resolved like that. `
`She had wanted to let her teacher take her next move...and had continued acting as though the game was still on. `
`She had immediately revived her with the Endless Power... `
`and had made her continue the game as though nothing had happened... `
`Then, the Predecessor slowly remembered that she had already been killed... `
`...and began to vanish completely. `
`When she did, the spear that had pierced Beatrice also vanished. `
`Beatrice finally landed on the ground. `
`...There wasn't even a trace of a scar. `
`"......It was fun, `
`Teacher. `
`If you want to play again, I'll revive you any time. `
`And once we've had some fun, I'll make you remember that you're a corpse again." `
`"See? `
`I did everything you told me to, right...? `
`Didn't you tell me to always put my toys back in their boxes when I'm done playing with them? `
`*cackle*cackle* Hahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!" `
`"...Was it...an easy victory?" `
`"You fool, it was a tough one!! `
`......If I hadn't tricked her with the four towers, I would've been the one dead! `
`...As I'd expect from Teacher. `
`......But now I can stand proud." `
`"...Now, I have completely surpassed Teacher. `
`Ronove, `
`clean up Teacher's remains a bit. `
`...I haven't lost my respect for her that much." `
`"Certainly. `
`Tonight's first twilight became a little too riotous. `
`A little cleanup will be necessary. `
`I shall see to it immediately." `
`"Goats, it is time to clean up." `
`When Ronove snapped his fingers, blazing, sparkling eyes began to blink open in the shadows and darkness, `
`becoming goat-headed attendants that appeared one after another. `
`One by one, they wordlessly stood at attention in a line behind Ronove's back. `
`"This time, what shall be done about the six corpses? `
`Another closed room pattern?" `
`"...I'm in no mood to think now. `
`I will leave it to you, Ronove. `
`...An extraordinary closed room to torment Battler, if you would." `
`"Certainly. `
`Then it shall be extraordinary." `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle* Hahhhahahahahahahahaha...!! `
`Oookay, where's Battler? `
`Battleeeeer, did you see my big momeeeeeeeeent??" `
`"......Damn iiiiiiiiit... `
`After being shown that screwed up magical storm, what can I deny?!" `
`"Forget just witches existing! `
`After being shown that tremendous, flashy fantasy, `
`what can I deny now?!! `
`I don't get it anymore! `
`It was like that last time too, but how can I deny these awesome, wonderful magical battles?!" `
`"Iiisn't that riiight?! `
`After watching this, you can't talk your way out of it, riiiiiiiight??? `
`Okay, Battler, let me hear some ridiculous reasoning, khehhihhyahhyahhya! `
`Ihhiehhiehhyaaahhh!!" `
`"Milady, your laugh is becoming undignified." `
`"Oh, my apologies. `
`But that isn't my fault. `
`After all, if Battler tightly closes his eyes, grinds his teeth, and shows me that ever so bitter expression, `
`it just automatically slips out of my mouth, you seeee... `
`Kuhhihihhyahhyahaah!!" `
`"So, Battler-sama, `
`why don't you return to the table without losing heart? `
`Milady is expecting your counterattack, you see...?" `
`"Quit messing with me!! `
`How the hell can I make a counterargument?!" `
`"In the first place, everything was already screwed up when that tower sprouted up out of the earth!! `
`Should I say that, under the ground in Rokkenjima, there's a secret laboratory for building super-alloy combining robots or something, `
`and that pushing a button can make these strange towers sprout up?! `
`Right, and then those huge giants must be the robots, `
`or maybe an evil secret association's mecha-monsters?!" `
`"I don't get it!! `
`Don't talk to meeeeeeeeeee, gwaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!" `
`"Look, look, look, look, don't cry, okay?? `
`Bang bang, it's magic!! `
`If you want, I'll crush the moon and make comets fall like rain! `
`I can even bury the whole island in those massive-breasted nee-chans you like so much, seeeeeeeeee?? `
`Hihhihhihhihhi!!" `
`"Come on, come on, look, look, look, my turn's over, seeeeeeeeee?! `
`Show me your response, launch your counterattack!! `
`You can't, can yoooooouuu? `
`Accept that there's a quadrillion things you can't do!! `
`You're useless against this, riiiiiiiiiight? `
`You actually like this kind of fantasy, don't yooooouuu??" `
`"I get it, that's been going around on the streets lately, hasn't it?! `
`In manga and light novels, in anime and movies! `
`Some teenage brats get a whole bunch of strange special abilities, and they blow up all sorts of stuff with the fate of the world on the line!" `
`"You love that too, don't you?! `
`I know, don't hide it, you love it, right, hi-hyahhyahhyah!! `
`Hasn't the thing you love just been displayed before your very eyes?" `
`"Why do you believe it in manga and anime, but you won't believe in meeeeeeeeee?? `
`Believe, believe, believe it! `
`You can't argue back, not after you've been shown something like this, riiiiiiiiiiiiight?" `
`"Look, look, look, answer, `
`you don't need to think, you can just obediently say 'I'm sorry, Beatrice-sama'! `
`Look, look, try saying it, 'I'm sorry, Beatrice-sama', try saying it, say it, say it, don't be embarrassed, `
`kukikikikakkakakahhyahhyaaaah hahhahhahahhhahahhyaaahh!!" `
