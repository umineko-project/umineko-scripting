`"Hahahaha, wahahahaha! `
`I never expected Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}'s piece to barge in at the very end...!" `
`"...I searched all over the place for a piece fitting for a game with you. `
`...I was sure you'd like it." `
`"What's with that piece?! `
`Who was that person, who was it?! `
`She didn't say her name! That's mean!! `
`Hey, don't you think so too?!" `
`"...I have a general idea. `
`...Or rather, I imagine most people would've figured it out." `
`"Most people?! `
`Well I don't get it, and it was that character's first appearance, wasn't it?! `
`If she doesn't say her name, I won't understand, the players won't understand, no one will understand, right?!" `
`"......Beato, don't bother telling her. `
`See? `
`Isn't she a funny kid?" `
`"I-Indeed. `
`...Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s innocent airhead side is truly precious and amusing. `
`...*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"Come on, come on, why won't you tell only me, you meanie?!! `
`In exchange, I'll teach you a special secret that only I know! `
`So tell me!" `
`"...Hoh. `
`A special secret, you say?! `
`I want to hear, I want to hear...!" `
`"Bleah! `
`If you want me to tell you, first tell me who that girl really was! `
`The secret I know sure is awesome! `
`After all, it's about as awesome as knowing that Santa-san is actually daddy! `
`Huh? `
`*giggle*! `
`I said it{p:0:â˜†} Sorry, I'll bet you're so shocked that it turned your world upside-down, right?! `
`Ohohohohoh!" `
`"......So, your father was the one who came to your place, Lambda?" `
`"He came...wait, what do you me-an?" `
`"...Lord {f:5:Santa Claus} only visits the homes of children with pure hearts. `
`I guess he didn't come to your place, did he?" `
`"Well, Lord {f:5:Santa Claus} is gracious. `
`Unless you're a re-ally bad scoundrel, he'll give you a present. `
`After all, he even gave them to me!" `
`"......As you grow and your heart is hardened, he stops coming, doesn't he? `
`How old were you, Beato, when he stopped coming?" `
`"Indeed. `
`He kept coming until I was about 12. `
`When my maiden's heart awoke, I quickly got somewhat embarrassed about Lord {f:5:Santa} coming." `
`"After I wrote 'Thanks for everything, that's enough, `
`so make sure you splurge on the last set of presents', he stopped coming. `
`Oooh, and I was looking forward to it too! `
`How old were you when he stopped coming, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}?" `
`"......I was pretty wild. `
`...It happened fairly early. `
`I think when I was about 9. `
`...Something about that beard really irritated me, so I waited in my futon with some sewing scissors ready, trying to cut it off. `
`......What a painful age." `
`"So, ...as far back as Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} can remember, Lord {f:5:Santa Claus} never came to see her, huh? `
`......He usually comes until the last year of elementary school or during middle school." `
`"...Maybe we should take her to a doctor. `
`I hear that being too precocious can have negative side-effects on the growth of mind and body. `
`...Yeah, you can definitely see some of those. `
`...Those negative side-effects." `
`"Hey, wh-what are you people talking about?!! `
`Bleeeeah!!" `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*! `
`Wahahahaha, it truly is boisterous when three witches gather!" `
`"...If you're talking about a secret on that level, I doubt this will be worth listening to. `
`Can I go now? `
`I have to get ready for the next game." `
`"What, hey, wait a sec! `
`Tell me who that woman really was!!" `
`"...Well then, tell me this special secret of yours first. `
`If it's good enough, then I'll tell you." `
`"Hohohohoh!! `
`Okay, I'll tell you, 'cause it really is a special secret! `
`...Remember, in this game, there was a girl who found the gold and became the new witch, right?" `
`"Indeed. `
`And just what kind of secret might that person have?" `
`"Ehheheheheh! `
`I figured out who that girl really is. `
`Does anyone know? `
`*giggle*giggle*! `
`There was a hint in the way she talked." `
`"Remember, that girl said it a lot, didn't she? `
`"If only you'd just blaaaah", `
`right?! `
`Yes, that phrase is the key point! `
`If only? Ifffonly? `
`Evvvvonly?! `
`Yes!" `
`"She was actually...Ushiromiya Eva!! `
`What do you think?! `
`Are you shocked?! `
`Ohohohohoh!!" `
`"Hoh...! `
`I never noticed that! `
`...Muu, to think that there would be a hint in a place like that." `
`"...You're a real good sport, Beato. `
`This kid tends to get full of herself, so try not to overdo it. `
`See you, I'm leaving." `
`"Wait, wait! `
`It's not fair if you just listen to my secret and don't tell me yours!! `
`Tell me who she really was!!" `
`"...Your secret was so amazing that mine just wouldn't match up. `
`...So in exchange, I'll teach you a special secret. `
`I'll tell you the name of the culprit in this game called "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni"." `
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, don't say it!! `
`I'm still playing i-t!!" `
`"...Ahhahahahahhahhahhahha... `
`See you, Beato. `
`The black tea was delicious. `
`However, the repertoire of jam on the crackers was lacking. `
`Add some gochujang chili paste every once in a while. `
`It goes great with Russian tea. `
`Later." `
`"Oh, I see. `
`I shall try it. `
`I'll call for some after preparing the next game. `
`Until then, feel free to polish up your strategy at your leisure." `
`"Yes, I'll do that. `
`This last game was pretty interesting. `
`Later." `
`"He-y, wait a sec, tell me-!!!" `
`"*cackle*cackle* `
`My, my, you two really are close." `
`"............ `
`...Yes, that's right. `
`...Oh, I really like you, {f:5:Bernkastel}. `
`You could even say I love you. `
`...I want to gouge out your eyes so that you see no one other than me. `
`...Oh, that would be so wonderful. `
`It'd be great to dunk them in black tea. `
`Aha!" `
`"To think that you would be so entranced, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}. `
`...I have a serious responsibility. `
`Still, this last game really was close! `
`I was a breath away from getting Battler." `
`"......Beato, `
`can I ask you something?" `
`"What is it? `
`I won't tell you that girl's name. `
`*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"...When are you gonna stop fooling around? `
`...Are you even trying to win?" `
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} threatened her with a low voice that she had never used in front of {f:5:Bernkastel}. `
`...It completely blew away the calm atmosphere that had been there until a moment ago. `
`"......You know `
`I'm supporting you because you're supposed to be a witch who can win against {f:5:Bernkastel}. `
`If you don't have the power to win against her, `
`then I'll abandon you right away, okay...?" `
`"......How harsh of you. `
`What about me dissatisfies you? `
`...As you know, my game board is perfect. `
`Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} will never be able to win..." `
`"Yeah, that's right. `
`Your board truly is impressive. `
`It truly is an impressive and perfect game board that {f:5:Bernkastel} definitely won't be able to win in, not even after a hundred years, `
`or even a thousand years." `
`"...That's why I made you a witch in exchange for letting me borrow it. `
`......If I stop being your guardian, you'll immediately go back to being a Human. `
`...Make sure you don't forget that, no matter how much incredible magical power you hold, ...you are nothing more than a temporary witch." `
`"...I-I understand. `
`...I'm grateful to you..." `
`"Don't speak so casually to me. `
`I'll forgive that when {f:5:Bernkastel}'s around, but not when she isn't. `
`I'll bet you've started to forget how much you owe me." `
`"Th-That is......n-n-not so..." `
`"...Aah, you really are disgusting. `
`Go ahead and talk the way you usually do. `
`But be mindful of what you say. `
`...I have a surprisingly short temper, you see?" `
`"I-Indeed..." `
`"Let's get back to what we were discussing. `
`...Your game board truly is perfect. `
`...You should be able to defeat {f:5:Bernkastel} without any trouble. `
`...But that kid won't surrender easily. `
`She'll challenge you over and over." `
`"That is no problem. `
`...It has been certified by you, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}. `
`...My game board is perfect." `
`"Yeah, that's right, it's perfect. `
`......But are you, the player, perfect as well?" `
`"......What do you mean by that...?" `
`"What do I mean? `
`That's what I want to hear. `
`......You play around a lot in your game. `
`...Sometimes, that ends up confusing {f:5:Bernkastel}, so at first I thought it was some special strategy of yours." `
`"......But I get the feeling that's not quite true. `
`Rather than toying with the opponent in a match you can win, `
`...you don't actually care whether you win or lose, right?" `
`"R-Ridiculous... `
`How could that be...?" `
`"You know what? `
`Your role is to make {f:5:Bernkastel} surrender. `
`In other words, that means being the victor in this game for all eternity. `
`...As long as you keep trying to become the victor "with certainty", then I'll give you my power as the Witch of Certainty. `
`......However." `
`"If you fight in a way that doesn't eliminate any possibility of your loss, `
`...that's a different story." `
`"Of course, this is a game... `
`Just as Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} will lose when I win, `
`...I will sometimes lose when she wins. `
`The possibility of loss always exists. `
`Therefore, I will-" `
`".........This is why you're useless. `
`There's no need for you to be a game board. `
`You just have to be a bird cage that can lock {f:5:Bernkastel} up here for all eternity." `
`"...What's the role of a bird cage? `
`Making certain the little bird inside never escapes. `
`...What's a bird cage worth if it has cracks that sometimes let a bird out?" `
`"......O-Of course, games exist for the purpose of winning. `
`And it is impossible for me to lose. `
`...Therefore, I will continue to win... `
`...As you wish, for all eternity..." `
`"Good answer, that'll be fine. `
`...I'll allow you to play around and use fakes as part of your tactics. `
`It ended up being useful during parts of this round." `
`"......But you know what? `
`If you make a move hoping for anything else other than victory, `
`......make sure you're prepared for something amazing, okay?" `
`"I-I will not do such a thing... `
`I swear it...!" `
`"......Because originally, you weren't even a witch, and at any time, `
`I'll remind you what a truly shabby creature you were. `
`......If you betray my expectations, that is. `
`As soon as you do, you can look forward to a fun, fun punishment game." `
`"...In the world of billions of Fragments, ...I'll send you into the most miserable one and seal you there. `
`......You were already miserable to start with, so there's gonna be some reeeally miserable Fragments out there for the picking. `
`...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*." `
`"............" `
`"Oh, I love you {f:5:Bernkastel}. `
`...Struggle in {f:5:Beatrice}'s bird cage as much as you like, `
`and over the course of a thousand years, realize that you can no longer escape." `
`"...And when you surrender, `
`...I'll train you so that you can't do anything other than cry in the palm of my hand." `
`"......*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle* `
`Ahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...!!" `
