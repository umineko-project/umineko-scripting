`When being beseiged, your true enemy isn't so much the fear of an unseen culprit... `
`as it is keeping such fears alive for long periods of time. `
`Maria got bored and started complaining that she wanted to watch TV. `
`There was no TV in the lobby, so she decided to return to the cousins' room on the second floor. `
`The adults probably wanted to make sure Maria wasn't left on her own... `
`They told all the children to go to the second floor cousins' room. `
`George, who was grief-stricken by the loss of his fiancée, led the cousins up to the second floor without any resistance. `
`At first, Nanjo had been reading a book in the lobby, `
`but when he noticed the relatives looking like they wanted to discuss something sinister, `
`he said "It seems I am in the way..." and returned to his room on the second floor. `
`"......I'm starving. `
`And if we just keep sitting around, we'll get sleepy too." `
`"It's only natural. `
`We didn't get any sleep at all last night." `
`"...We will probably end up being barricaded here for a full 24 hours. `
`It may be wiser to take naps in turn instead of over-stressing ourselves." `
`"True. `
`My husband and I will remain here, so I ask that anyone having trouble staying awake take it easy and rest." `
`"Our opponent might be expecting that, right? `
`Even if they couldn't defeat this many people, if that number shrinks enough, they may plan to use that moment to strike." `
`"There are seven of us here, `
`so we could take three-hour shifts in pairs. `
`...Tomorrow morning's a long way off. `
`We still have some energy now, but tonight's going to be tough." `
`"Sure will. `
`Anyone sleepy? `
`Don't overdo it, and get some rest." `
`Hideyoshi looked around at everyone to see who wanted to sleep first, but no one volunteered. `
`...Everyone was just as tired, but no one was bold enough to go to sleep right away. `
`...Their fear of the unknown culprit was just as strong as their sleepiness. `
`"...Nobody? `
`Well, don't overdo it, everyone." `
`"If we get tired, we'll deal with it then. `
`...I'll admit I'm sleepy, but I'm not in the mood now." `
`As Eva spoke sharply, she reread the second letter from Beatrice, which had been found in the boiler room. `
`Beatrice had sent them two letters, which had repeatedly told them to solve the riddle of the epitaph. `
`And she'd even provoked them by saying she'd give up her assets and the Headship if they could solve it... `
`Eva took out a notebook and opened it to a page with the epitaph copied onto it. `
`"......Is this that epitaph?" `
`"Yes. `
`...I hate doing what the culprit says, `
`but we do have time to waste. `
`I think it's the perfect way to stave off boredom." `
`"...Not a bad way to kill time. `
`Why don't we challenge it together as siblings?" `
`"...Can I borrow that? `
`I'll rewrite it just a little larger. `
`Natsuhi-san, do you have a slightly larger piece of paper?" `
`"There should be paper in the servant room. `
`I will bring some." `
`Natsuhi immediately brought a blank B4 sheet of paper from the servant room. `
`Kyrie borrowed Eva's notebook, wrote out the epitaph on the paper, and laid it out on the table. `
`Then, everyone quickly peered down at it. `
`...They automatically formed a crowd. `
`"I've heard about it, `
`...but, really, this is a tough riddle. `
`I don't have a clue what it's talkin' about." `
`"At one point, I also did my best to solve it, but I was just as clueless." `
`"If you did know, you wouldn't have come all the way out here with a plan to make money. `
`After all, it's 10 tons of gold we're talking about." `
`"......This is the first time I've read through it seriously, but... `
`roughly speaking, couldn't it be split into three parts?" `
`"...I've been thinking this since last night, but you really are a good thinker, Kyrie-san. `
`Perhaps you'll be able to easily solve this riddle that we couldn't." `
`"Yeah. `
`Kyrie's sharp. `
`...She might find a more interesting take on it if she comes in without any confusing biases." `
`"......That's right. `
`Kyrie-san, `
`would you mind giving us your honest opinion after reading the epitaph?" `
`"I doubt you'll find it useful. `
`You all give me too much credit." `
`"That's fine, just say whatever comes into your head. `
`Let's hear your thoughts. `
`...The hints you give always help me out when I'm worried." `
`"Oh, so I have been helpful? `
`It's nice to finally hear about this now." `
`"Come ooon, don't I always thank you?" `
`"You two sure are close. `
`I'm jealous." `
`"And the rest of us would also love to hear these hints of yours. `
`We're just killing time anyway, so relax, okay?" `
`Kyrie was disturbed at being praised so highly for something so strange. `
`...But they had all the time in the world. `
`Realizing that this was just a way to waste time, she decided to accept the role she'd been given... `
`"...I'm sure I'll say something off the mark, but... `
`well, I'll put forward my ideas." `
`"Indeed. `
`...What did you mean in the beginning, about how it could be divided into three parts, roughly speaking?" `
`Well, ...I just mean what I said. `
`I think that overall, the epitaph can be divided into three sections. `
`First, there are the five lines up until "There sleeps the key to the gold". `
`Up until this point is the first part, which directs you to the location of the key. `
`And then there's the part formed by the 11 lines up until the tenth twilight, which refer to the location of the Golden Land itself. `
`And the remaining six lines make up the part after the Golden Land has been reached. `
`"I see. `
`It can be divided into three parts about the key, the Golden Land, `
`and the Golden Land's treasure." `
`"Even we have been able to grasp that much. `
`The three sections that refer to the key, the door, and the treasure." `
`"...Nii-san, don't butt in any more than you have to! `
`Let Kyrie-san speak her ideas freely." `
`"Kyrie, `
`please continue. `
`...We see it the same way you do so far. `
`So then?" `
`"...I wonder about the meaning of that thing in the beginning, the "beloved hometown". `
`Normally, that would refer to where Grandfather lived, right? `
`Since Father went to all the trouble of telling us that it's beloved, we can imagine that it's a hometown he had strong feelings for. `
`...Did Father come from Odawara?" `
`"......Odawara is definitely where he was born, `
`but I don't think that's the hometown he loved. `
`I imagine all of us siblings have the same place in mind." `
`"...Right. `
`This probably isn't Odawara. `
`From what I've heard, he had a very fun time as a youth." `
`"Hahhaha. `
`...Being made the Ushiromiya Family Head was probably Dad's greatest bit of misfortune in life." `
`"...Probably. `
`Father didn't actually want to become the Head." `
`"So where is this place? `
`Is there a river there where sweetfish swim?" `
`"...Maybe there was at the time. `
`There's been a lot of development there since then, and the sweetfish might have disappeared. `
`It would be extremely difficult to investigate whether sweetfish were there during Grandfather's boyhood years." `
`"And there probably isn't just a single river. `
`I believe we all gave this a thorough investigation geographically. `
`...You even went to the actual place to investigate directly, right, Eva?" `
`"That was only as a vacation. `
`...But, the townscape had changed completely since Father's time. `
`After all, it was caught up in that war, wasn't it? `
`By now, even precisely locating the place Father lived is impossible. `
`...I imagine that if Father went there himself now, `
`even he wouldn't be able to pick out the place he'd lived anymore." `
`"Well, after all, those guys have also gone through a remarkable recovery..." `
`"......Does the part about a sweetfish river bring any place name clearly to mind?" `
`"Well, yeah. `
`After all, they're sweetfish, right? `
`People say they live in rivers with clean water, so there are countless rivers that might work. `
`Any stream Dad innocently went sweetfish-fishing in was probably buried by the development later. `
`It'd be different if we had a map from before the war or a person who knew a lot about how the area was before the war, but..." `
`"...It probably isn't something like that." `
`"What do you mean...?" `
`"...Behold the sweetfish river running through my beloved hometown. `
`You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key. `
`...After these two lines, there's a single blank line. `
`...Something is being presented with just these two lines. `
`What if the next three lines continue based upon that something?" `
`"What do you mean, something is being presented...?" `
`"...I don't know. `
`At any rate, what we can get from these two lines alone isn't something vague, like the question of which river it might be, `
`but the clear presentation of the keyword "river"." `
`"...It may be that this isn't a "river" with water flowing down it. `
`...The "sweetfish river" might be some kind of metaphor. `
`...What sort of impressions does the word "sweetfish" give?" `
`"......Sweetfish are like salmon. `
`They're freshwater fish, but they go out into the ocean right after they're born. `
`When they get big, they go back to the river to live there, `
`and then they spawn there and end their lives there. `
`Well, they leave their home at one point, but when they get big, they come back and lay eggs. `
`Might be able to link that to the idea of clan prosperity." `
`"Oh? `
`They're freshwater fish, but they can live in the ocean? `
`I didn't know that. `
`I figured river fish wouldn't be able to live in the sea." `
`"And they are called sweetfish because they have a pleasant aroma. `
`I have never eaten one, but I have heard they can be quite delicious when grilled with salt." `
`"What's that, Natsuhi-san?! `
`You've never eaten salt-grilled sweetfish?! `
`They're delicious! `
`You should try it sometime soon!" `
`"It is a food for commoners. `
`Hardly appropriate for your mouth." `
`"...This is just my wild idea, `
`...but the impression I get from a sweetfish river makes me suspect a family tree. `
`The sweetfish go out into the ocean for a time, but they return to the river where they were born to spawn, right? `
`......It reminds me of myself." `
`"You're right. `
`By this point, `
`I can confess that I've sometimes suspected that it refers to you and Maria-chan." `
`"I see. `
`...If you follow the river downstream, you will find a village. `
`If you go down the family tree, all you find is Maria's name ({p:0:真里亞}). Only her name has a "{ruby:ri/sato:{p:0:里}}", the character Father uses for village here." `
`"Isn't that right?! `
`...But as you all know, Father doesn't like Maria, `
`and he almost never speaks with her. `
`And, in the past, Father told me to give Maria a completely different name. `
`I just decided to go with Maria on my own. `
`Father was very mad about that. `
`...Given that, `
`it's very hard to imagine that he would reference Maria's name in his precious epitaph about who would succeed his wealth and inheritance." `
`"Have you ever let Maria-chan read the epitaph?" `
`"Uh, yes, of course. `
`But it looked as though she didn't have a clue. `
`...She didn't have a clue, and she kept going on about that same occult stuff, about how it was a resurrection ceremony for the witch." `
`"......A connection between Father and Maria. `
`...Certainly, they do share that occult hobby, but they never interacted. `
`...I can't imagine that it refers to Maria either." `
`"...What sticks out to me is how he went out of his way to add "beloved" to that first line. `
`...Like you all said just now, `
`if Father was reluctant about becoming the Ushiromiya Family Head, `
`would he have fond memories for anything connected to that? `
`...I don't think this can be Odawara, which represents the Ushiromiya Head Family." `
`"...I believe this word "beloved" here at the beginning... `
`must refer to a place full of very important memories to Father." `
`"......Hmmmmmm. `
`...Well, that's fine. `
`It would be hard to pinpoint since we don't have even a trace of a map from that time, `
`but at any rate, there were probably several rivers with sweetfish swimming in them near Dad's hometown during his youth." `
`"That's if we're looking for a river with water flowing down it, right? `
`And then? `
`Go on, Kyrie-san." `
`"...I don't really understand the three lines starting with "If you follow the river downstream, you will find a village". `
`...It's probably linked to the two lines about the sweetfish river. `
`I imagine it's something we'd understand automatically if we knew what the sweetfish river really was. `
`...Until we figure that out, it's probably useless to try and solve those three lines any further." `
`"So we're stuck unless we know what the "sweetfish river" really is... `
`And there's no guarantee it even means a literal river. `
`...Seriously. `
`What's up with the sweetfish? `
`Did Dad like to eat them? `
`Or does it have some special meaning? `
`Is it pointless to read too deeply into it?" `
`"...If you don't have both a micro and a macro perspective, your field of vision grows narrow. `
`...It might be better to be flexible and avoid thinking too deeply, `
`focusing on an abstract image of a river where fish swim, or something that can flow... `
`up or down." `
`"Then, the answer behind the "sweetfish river" passes through the next three lines and makes its way to the "key to the Golden Land"..." `
`"If you think about it this way, I wonder if it was a mistake to split it into three parts. `
`There's actually four parts. `
`..."Go down the sweetfish river", `
`"find the key to the Golden Land", `
`"journey to the Golden Land", `
`and "the treasure of the Golden Land"." `
`"Hmmm... `
`...Truly intriguing. `
`Well, you've gone this far. Would you mind continuing and telling us your opinion on the most central portion of the epitaph, `
`up to the point when we reach the Golden Land on the tenth twilight?" `
`"...That's the most symbolic...and also the most disturbing part." `
`"Since the word "sacrifices" keeps coming up, `
`I can't help but think it has something to do with Father's occult ceremonies... `
`......How do you see it, Kyrie-san?" `
`Kyrie recrossed her arms several times, `
`peering into the paper with the epitaph copied onto it as though she was looking through it... `
`"......... `
`......This is...very difficult. `
`...It starts with "the one who obtains the key", `
`so you probably won't be able to continue without knowing what that key means. `
`...I'll have to give up on that, but I'll take a shot at trying to solve it anyway." `
`"...Just like how the "sweetfish river" isn't necessarily a river with water flowing down it, `
`it's also doubtful that this "key" is actually something shaped like a key." `
`"Right. `
`It might also be a code or a keyword. `
`...After all, this key isn't something to be stuck into a keyhole. `
`It's something that selects six people to be sacrifices for the first twilight. `
`In that sense, we can say for sure that this key isn't being used to open the door to the Golden Land." `
`"...But what a disturbing key it is. `
`A key that can choose six human sacrifices..." `
`"How would a key select anything? `
`...Do ya spin it like a roulette...?" `
`"This key indicates a certain group of six people. `
`...No, we should say it indicates a certain group of six things, `
`...if this doesn't mean a literal command to offer sacrifices. `
`For example, it could be an anagram." `
`"An anagram? `
`Do you mean playing with letters...?" `
`"Yes. `
`I've been thinking about it ever since Rosa started talking about the family tree, `
`and about how village was a part of Maria-chan's name." `
`"...It seems that ever since the words "beloved hometown" came up, `
`Rudolf-san, for example, has assumed that this epitaph points to some coordinates or some other geographical feature, but that might not be the case. `
`This could be some kind of puzzle, ...or maybe playing with letters." `
`"...Forgive me, `
`but how does one play with letters?" `
`"Oh, well, it's like "sucker merry barrels". `
`Whaaat do you get when you take out the e's and r's? `
`Like that. `
`Well, you were raised well, Natsuhi-san, so you probably don't know." `
`"...Merry?? Take out the e's and r's, huh? `
`???" `
`"Stop it. `
`It is an undignified game, inappropriate for you." `
`Only Natsuhi didn't get it and had a blank look on her face. `
`It seemed she'd only guessed that the answer had to be something undignified, `
`going by Rudolf and Eva's sniggers. `
`"Ah, ...Natsuhi nee-san, it's something like this. `
`This is just something from Maria's book of riddles, okay? `
`There's this thing called a Tanuki Notebook." `
`"It's a notebook written like a code, with a lot of 'ta's mixed in, `
`and if you "remove" all of the 'ta's, then the true paragraph pops up. `
`It's a game like that." `
`"Ah, ...oh, I see. `
`......??" `
`Natsuhi finally realized the answer to the undignified riddle Rudolf had posed, and her face grew red as she hung her head in embarrassment. `
`"......So maybe "kill" actually means "remove" in that sense, right...?" `
`"Yes. `
`I also thought that. `
`It's possible that the key to the Golden Land is a word with six characters." `
`"In other words, ...the "ta" from the Tanuki Notebook...is actually six characters here...? `
`Hmmm, ...this is getting complicated..." `
`"Playing with letters, is it...? `
`...Hmmm. `
`In Japan, it really feels like a child's game, but it's apparently a stylish form of humor among intellectuals in the English world. `
`...It is easy to imagine that Father was interested in it." `
`"...But by this point, I quickly lose my ability to understand it. `
`Up until this part, it may have been filled with mysteries, but it was extremely sequential." `
`""Sweetfish river", "go down it", "then find the key"...all of that is extremely sequential. `
`And as a result, we can guess that we gain a six-character key, `
`...but in that case, we now don't know "what" we kill the six characters from." `
`"That's right. `
`Where do we pull the six characters from? `
`It doesn't tell us." `
`"...On the second twilight, there are "those who remain". `
`...Which means that, at the very least, that "something" has a limited number of characters. `
`You could read it like it's telling you to continue with the remaining characters after the first six characters are removed." `
`"......And yet, we don't know what this "something" is, even though it should've been shown to us at the beginning. `
`...Are we wrong even in our assumption that this is playing with letters...?" `
`".........Hmmmmm..." `
`Everyone crossed their arms and fell silent. `
`It felt like they were about to reach a novel understanding they hadn't managed before, ...but they stumbled just one step short. `
`Then, Hideyoshi's stomach rumbled heartily. `
`That silence was broken by laughter. `
`"Sorry, sorry. `
`Strangely enough, by spinnin' the gears in my head for a change, my stomach's gone completely empty. `
`Looks like I can't stand missin' breakfast, ...wahahahahaha." `
`"Natsuhi, `
`isn't there anything to eat here?" `
`"There should at least be enough set aside for breakfast. `
`I will prepare it." `
`"I'm also starving. `
`And I'll bet those brats above us are the same. `
`...Still, I doubt there's enough for the 18 people here, much less a full three meals, right?" `
`"That's right. `
`It'll be a long journey 'til tomorrow. `
`Maybe we'd better take a trip back to the mansion and fish around for some canned food or somethin' in the kitchen." `
`"There's nothing more than crackers and snacks here, but if that will be sufficient, I can get them ready for you all. `
`But with this many people, there might not be any left for lunch..." `
`"That will do for now. `
`Would you mind getting those ready?" `
`It looked like the men had been taken over with an appetite that stopped all thought. `
`The atmosphere grew more peaceful, and the epitaph investigation team split up for the time being. `
`...But Eva kept staring at the paper the epitaph was written on like she was going to burn a hole through it... `
`"......Playing around with letters was nothing more than a theory of mine. `
`There's a chance it's mistaken. `
`Eva-san, don't take it too seriously, okay...?" `
`"......Thank you. `
`I'll just keep doing this on my own. `
`Would you mind leaving me alone?" `
`Eva spoke coldly. `
`...Kyrie didn't bother her any more, and instead went to help Natsuhi prepare breakfast. `
`"Nee-san, `
`shouldn't we also help prepare breakfast?" `
`"Then you go help. `
`I'm busy solving this!" `
`"S-Sorry... `
`Th-Then I'll help..." `
`"......Good grief. `
`How can you be like that?" `
`"...Huh?" `
`"The Ushiromiya Family Headship will be given to the person who solves this epitaph. `
`It looks like you've given up from the beginning, as if it has nothing to do with you, `
`but if you can solve it, there's a chance even you'll be able to receive the Headship." `
`"...This is a chance to steal everything from Nii-san. `
`Why aren't you taking such a once-in-a-lifetime chance more seriously?" `
`"...Um, ......umm, ...I..." `
`Rosa hung her head, unsure as to how she should answer. `
`...Too late, she regretted carelessly speaking to her sister when she was in a bad mood. `
`"If you've noticed anything, say so. `
`Even though Kyrie-san and I were thinking hard, you just kept nodding your head, didn't you? `
`Come on. `
`Isn't there anything you've noticed? `
`Come on!" `
`"......Uh, `
`......umm, `
`...... `
`...Don't...you think this part's strange?" `
`"...Strange? `
`What is?" `
`"Umm, ...this word, Golden Land. `
`The word Golden Land comes up several times." `
`"So what? `
`Do you get some keywords by splitting up the characters in "Golden Land"?" `
`"Um, umm, that's not it. `
`......Look, isn't just the tenth twilight strange?" `
`"...............Huh? `
`......ah." `
`"Even though they're all written the "Golden Land" ({ruby:ougonkyou:{p:0:黄金郷}}), for some reason, this one place has the "Home of the Gold" ({ruby:ougon no sato:{p:0:黄金の郷}}). `
`He explicitly mixed in the character {ruby:no:{p:0:の}}, changing the phrasing. `
`It vaguely bugged me that it's only said differently here..." `
`".........ah, umm, ...it's not like it means anything. `
`This is Father we're talking about. `
`It could just be a coincidental change in how he said the word." `
`".........................................." `
`".........Boring." `
`"Oh? What is boring...?" `
`"......Boring, boring." `
`"My, my. `
`What on earth is this child grumbling about?" `
`"She's probably annoyed by all the tips you gave Battler-sama, Madam." `
`"...Nooot really. `
`That doesn't annoy me. `
`On the contrary, I'm happy to see that useless Battler finally reach a level where he can match me." `
`"Hohohoh... `
`Did Battler-kun and I get a little too close? `
`Perhaps us old fogeys had best leave you young'uns alone." `
`"Pu ku ku ku ku..." `
`When Virgilia and Ronove giggled and cackled, `
`Beatrice's irritation meter finally reached its limit. `
`"Gaah, enough with everyone laughing at me! `
`Ronove, vanish for a while! `
`Disappear, disappeeear!" `
`"Certainly. `
`Then I shall rest for the time being. `
`Pukukukuku..." `
`Ronove bowed his head, still laughing, and vanished. `
`After that, all that remained was the grumpy and irritated figure of Beatrice... `
`and Virgilia, who was coolly enjoying her tea. `
`"......When you said "{p:1:There are no more than 18 people on this island}", you actually cornered yourself." `
`"......I knew it... `
`......I did have this feeling it might be a bit too early... `
`I suppose that was right after all, wasn't it?" `
`"If you had led him further astray first, things might have been different, `
`but as it was, that trump card was a real waste. `
`You ended up rousing him instead." `
`In addition to denying the witch, `
`Battler had possessed a second victory condition, one of explaining everything without suspecting one of the 18. `
`It was at that point, when he'd been tossed about by two opposing goals, that his heart should have been at its weakest. `
`However, Beatrice had used the red carelessly, proclaiming that there were no more than 18 people. `
`...Because of that, Battler had been forced to suspect one of the 18, `
`......and he had finally begun to build up the resolve he needed to accept that. `
`Battler was stubborn, `
`but that was exactly why fissures would run all through him, like breaking china, when he was struck in a fragile spot. `
`That itself should have been his greatest weak point, but... `
`"......Nnnngggg. `
`...Did I get a little too careless after my complete victory last time...?" `
`"Yes, you were too careless. `
`...The last game was a difficult one for Battler-kun, `
`but it seems this game will become `
`a difficult one {i:for you}." `
`"...A broken vase will never return to its original form. `
`...So, it would be more constructive to think of a next move, rather than regretfully picking up the pieces." `
`"......However, now that Battler has figured out as much as he has, how should I plot against him...?" `
`"Hohohoh. `
`Your troubled face is an even better snack than Ronove's cookies." `
`"...Uu-. `
`You and Battler...and even Ronove are treating me like sweets now. `
`...Even though I'm not sweet at all." `
`With a shameful, childlike face that she would never have shown in front of Battler, `
`Beatrice rolled her head around on top of the table. `
`"......Teacheeer. `
`......At least gimme a hi-nt." `
`"Oh? `
`What kind of hint?" `
`"If you know some really good move that'll leave Battler speechless and make him wanna accept me... `
`I won't ask you to say it outright, so, umm, `
`...even if it's just a hint..." `
`"Hohohoh, I can't. `
`I am on Battler-kun's side right now, `
`so I couldn't teach you something that would give you an advantage." `
`"...C'mon, don't be so stingy... `
`Your disciple's in trouble, right...?" `
`"I seem to remember you brazenly boasting that you had surpassed your teacher." `
`"......Uu-... `
`Please act like an old person and gimme just a bit of your crafty ideas... `
`Pleease... `
`It's mean if you only help Battleeer..." `
`"My, my. `
`You're still a spoiled child." `
`"...But, it's true that I may have given Battler-kun a few too many hints. `
`It did serve as a scolding to you, `
`but perhaps it was a little too much support for a fair game." `
`"Isn't that right, isn't that right...? `
`Please, Teacheeer, at least just a hint now..." `
`".........This is only a hint. `
`Think about what it means by yourself, okay?" `
`"Yeah, yeah! `
`I'll think about it myself, so please! `
`Please, gimme one that'll leave Battler down in the dumps, Teacher." `
`Considering how she acted like a great and mighty witch in front of Battler, the way she acted when he wasn't around was truly pathetic. `
`Virgilia sighed at how childish Beato still was, despite all the time that had passed. `
`"Then just a hint. `
`...Do you know of Aesop's fable, The North Wind and the Sun?" `
`"Of course. `
`It's a story about how the north wind and the sun challenge each other to see who can steal the cloak off a traveler, right?" `
`"That's right. `
`Violent, impatient methods aren't necessarily the best decisions in all cases." `
`"...You don't have to tell me that. `
`I've already reflected on the mistakes I made when I was too anxious to achieve victory." `
`"...... `
`Think well about what this means. `
`And furthermore, `
`...there's one point that Battler seems to be misunderstanding a bit, but he isn't the only one." `
`"Do you understand the victory conditions of this game?" `
`"...What else is there, other than making Battler surrender?" `
`"......See? `
`You're already wrong there." `
`"How am I wrong?" `
`"Your victory isn't making Battler-kun surrender. `
`...Isn't it making Battler-kun accept your existence?" `
`"...What's this? `
`You want me to butter him up, begging him to accept me as a witch?! `
`How foolish! `
`I haven't sunk that low!" `
`Grrrrrrrrrrr... Beato growled like a dog in a bad mood. `
`Virgilia shrugged her shoulders, snickering at her disciple, who was as short-tempered as ever... `
`"That is my hint. `
`For the rest, you'll have to consider deeply on your own. `
`......In any event, your moves up until now will not work on Battler-kun. `
`A significant tactical adjustment will probably be required." `
`"...I don't need you to tell me that. `
`...I don't have a clue what you mean by the North Wind and the Sun, `
`but at any rate, I realize I'll have to alter my course. `
`...I'll introduce a scheme clever enough to surprise even you, Teacher...!" `
`"Hohoho... `
`I look forward to it. `
`I wonder how Battler-kun will tackle that. `
`...I wish you good luck as well." `
`"After Battler, you mean? `
`Hmm..." `
`"......Are you gonna give up and resign already? `
`I guess you are that tired. If only you'd just grab a futon and sleep..." `
`...As my mind grew vague and I pretended to fight my drowsiness, while sinking deeper and deeper into the sofa, `
`"I" scolded myself. `
`"...You also dreamed about stealing the position of Family Head from Krauss, right...? `
`Even though my magic's given you a chance, are you already throwing it away...?" `
`You could say that, but... `
`......This riddle is really hard. `
`Even a wire puzzle would be better. `
`...At least in that case, you know for sure that it's solvable. `
`But in the case of this epitaph riddle, we've been given no reason to be sure of that. `
`...I might just be fighting a useless battle. `
`...Still hazy, I looked at the notebook I'd been holding the whole time. `
`It was opened to a page with the epitaph, which I must've stared at hard enough to burn holes in it on so many hundreds of nights, I'd lost count. `
`...That page...is truly a door. `
`On the other side lies the "Golden Land", the place I've wanted to drag myself to no matter the effort ever since I was a child, `
`...and the place I was never able to reach. `
`Am I touching the door with both hands, `
`with the book...no, the door right there in front of me, ready to be opened, ...and yet still unable to reach the other side? `
`"...That's right. `
`Your hand is already on the door. `
`Come on, open it with all your strength. `
`And read the characters written on the door." `
`"......Open it... `
`with all my strength. `
`...Read... `
`the characters written on the door..." `
`Strain your eyes. `
`...See through to the thing beyond the epitaph written in the notebook... `
`"...The "beloved hometown" definitely won't betray our expectations. `
`...The only past Father held dear happened during his childhood years." `
`That's right... `
`Then what about the "sweetfish river"? `
`There are several rivers where they swim, and there's reason to doubt that this just refers to one close to the place Father lived. `
`...If we take out a map and start calculating which rivers with sweetfish were closest, `
`...things will quickly get vague and we won't be able to narrow it down... `
`"Didn't you say it yourself? `
`You said it didn't have to be a river with water flowing down it. `
`...If the word sweetfish is too complicated, why not forget it...?" `
`"Think of a river. `
`A river. `
`Linking it with a "family tree" wasn't a bad idea. `
`Try thinking about how to link a river with something else along those lines..." `
`...It isn't a river? `
`But where else could sweetfish swim? `
`Oh, but if we're talking about places sweetfish can swim, then maybe the ocean has something to do with this... `
`Didn't my husband even say that they go out into the ocean, even though they're river fish...? `
`....................................... `
`.................. `
`......To the ocean. `
`............No, `
`......... `
`...but...`.........Huh...? `
`"...Did you notice? `
`But that's just a faint memory. `
`There's supposed to be a room for storing books in this building, right? `
`If you investigate, you can make sure." `
`...If that's the "sweetfish river"...... `
`......And if the key might be a six character word... `
`.........Then could the key actually be resting in that river? `
`I-I don't know, I don't know. `
`...Anyway, I have to search in an atlas... `
`But, even if I know that, I don't know "from what" I should take the six characters... `
`"...You really don't know? `
`Think deeply. `
`......We're pretty smart, so our ideas are solid." `
`"Don't think of it like it's something as massive as the riddle of the epitaph, but like it's a child's riddle. `
`...Men are always children, no matter how old they get. `
`Even if Father has advanced into old age, `
`that doesn't change the fact that he's essentially a child at heart." `
`"......Throw away your awe of Father. `
`...Think of this like it's a worthless, infantile game with riddles, like the ones Maria suddenly brought out on the boat." `
`...Riddles. `
`...Worthless, infantile. `
`............ `
`.........Huh, ......ah. `
`...I'm sure that was...what was it...umm, umm... `
`...I'm sure, if my memory isn't wrong, ...that it's probably the case, umm... `
`No, I don't have to rely on my vague memory. `
`I should be able to figure that out immediately by searching the library. `
`"......We've probably already noticed the answer. `
`...All that's left is to investigate whether it's correct or not." `
`"Come on, Eva. `
`Let's go to the library, making sure no one sees us. `
`...There, we should find a mountain of thick books that didn't fit in Father's study. `
`...I'm sure we'll find a book that answers our question. `
`......Quickly. `
`This is the first and last chance we'll ever get to make our dreams come true." `
`When Natsuhi tried to lay a blanket over her, Eva suddenly jumped up. `
`"...I'm sorry. `
`It looks like I woke you." `
`"...Eva, `
`if you're sleepy, don't overdo it. `
`You rest first." `
`"...Th-Thank you. `
`I'm just going to the bathroom for a bit to wash my face." `
`"You should take it easy and rest. `
`...You're just gonna make yourself feel worse, you know?" `
`"I told you I'm fine! `
`I'll be right back." `
`After leaving only those words behind, I rapidly left the lobby. `
`The lobby was partitioned off by a door, so as soon as I went into the corridor, they could no longer see me. `
`...The library was next to the servant room. `
`Father always owned a vast book collection, `
`but ever since he started to become engrossed with his occult hobby, that collection grew even larger, `
`so that the normal books suitable for a normal study had been forced out as his study overflowed. `
`This so-called library was mostly used as a storage room for those normal books. `
`They were all thick, like complete encyclopedias for intellectuals, `
`but that was very convenient for me, now that I was investigating something. `
`I entered softly, ...and just in case, I checked the room with my gun readied, making sure that there were no suspicious people there. `
`Then I locked it from the inside. `
`I actually wasn't thinking that the murderer might be hiding somewhere. `
`...What scared me was the thought that one of my siblings might hear what I was investigating. `
`My heart had started racing before I realized it... `
`...I was half-asleep just a moment ago, so I didn't realize how significant this thing I noticed was. `
`But as I gradually became aware, ...my heart started to feel like it was about to explode. `
`"......I...wonder if any of the other siblings have noticed this..." `
`I don't think Krauss and Rudolf will notice. `
`...But I don't know about Kyrie. `
`She has extraordinarily good intuition. `
`......And I don't know about Rosa either. `
`"Rosa's stupid too. `
`She always has been, incredibly so." `
`Really...? `
`I'd say she was wise enough to make you think she was stupid, so that she didn't earn herself unnecessary malice. `
`"......Here it is. `
`...I wonder if we'll find it in this one." `
`I pulled the book out and flipped through the pages... `
`"......Nn. `
`......So this is... `
`...... `
`a "sweetfish river"...?" `
`I see... `
`This is what the sweetfish river means. `
`...Don't dawdle around, research further. `
`"Y-Yes, I understand... `
`If you follow the river downstream, you will find a village... `
`By using the character "{p:0:里}", does he mean a town or something? `
`That's just an area of dense population, so there could be any number of those..." `
`Why have you stopped thinking?! `
`Oh, is this too much work for you? If only you'd just give up... `
`If only you'd just hand the Ushiromiya Headship over to Kyrie...! `
`"I-I don't want to... `
`I will become the Head. `
`...This is...umm, my first and last chance... `
`...What is this village? `
`What does it mean?! `
`Do you find one if you go down the river...?! `
`......Ah, ... `
`aaaaaaaahhh...!!" `
`...In the village, look for the shore the two will tell you of. `
`...{ruby:shore:{p:0:岸}}. `
`Get it? `
`"Uu, ...*gulp*... `
`I-I-I understand...! `
`"Shore", ..."shore"......!" `
`...the pieces that I hadn't been able to understand at all... `
`...began to *snap*... `
`*snap*... `
`into place, all by themselves... `
`I couldn't even remember to close my open mouth. `
`...My throat grew completely dry... `
`Is it...really okay for this to be the answer? `
`R-Really? `
`Really...?! `
`"...But this isn't six characters at all. `
`...I'm absolutely sure this is the answer, but this doesn't reach six characters at all...!" `
`Did you stop thinking again? `
`In that case, think of a way you could read it with six characters. `
`If you can't think of one, then research it. `
`...There has to be an answer. `
`You must not doubt that. `
`Is believing in that too much for you? If only you'd just cry yourself to sleep, and then you can just give up and die... `
`"............1, `
`2, `
`3, `
`4, `
`5, `
`6... `
`...Oooh, `
`...s `
`- `
`six characters... `
`" `
`...I- `
`I found it. `
`...This... `
`is... `
`th- `
`the key to the Golden Land...!!" `
`Yes. `
`This is...the key to the Golden Land. `
`...The key...to our childhood dreams. `
`...The only keyhole this key can be stuck in...is that place. `
`That...has to be what offering the sacrifices means. `
`I'm sure you get it by now, right......? `
`"...A-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!!" `
