`".........This way?`
` ......That means go this way, right............?`
` They are......inviting me to go this way, after all........."`
`......!!!`
`My heart leapt.`
` ...Because there, ............gaping wide, ......was the opened mouth of eerie darkness.`
`"Wh‐.........what is this...`
` What is this......?!"`
`When I strained my eyes, peering into the darkness, I saw something that looked like a light switch.`
` ......In addition, there was a switch with open and close written on it.`
`I resolutely pushed the switch for the lights,`
` and rough lights almost like you'd find in a coal mine or something flickered on sporadically,`
` making a staircase that stretched underground come hazily into vision...`
`It was creepy how it now looked even more gloomy with the lights turned on.`
`Other than the light switch, there was also a switch with open and close written on it.`
`...I could probably open and close it with this, but if I was unlucky enough to find that the open part was broken,`
` I might be closed up in this creepy underground area for all eternity...`
`So for the time being, I didn't touch the open/close switch,`
` ......and as I readied my gun again, I slowly went down the stairs.`
`Because the ceiling was very high, it didn't feel cramped.`
`{n}On the contrary, it felt as though a cool breeze was blowing upwards, and I even sensed a spiritual presence from the eeriness of it...`
`With my gun at the ready, and carefully staring forwards, ......I continued descending the stairs......`
`The walls, the stairs, the lights, ...all of them were very old‐fashioned.`
`{n}...It may be beyond doubt that this had been made at the same time that the mansion had been constructed on this island.`
`There were cracks in the ceiling, and water clung to the walls, constantly dripping down.`
`That water fell into a gutter that had been set up alongside the stairs, then quickly and silently flowed into the underground darkness.`
` It was as though it was telling me to go faster...`
`The staircase turned back on itself a number of times.`
` It was hard to tell how far underground I'd gone, but I thought it to be much deeper than one floor.`
`And eventually, ............a rough, metal door showed itself.`
`And there, characters had been written in a dark red paint.`
`{n}...They had probably been written a long time ago.`
`— {p:1:On the tenth twilight, the journey ends, and you shall reach the Home of the Gold.}`
`My heart, which was already about to explode, jumped about even more as soon as I read those deep‐red characters...`
`There's no mistake...`
` This is the last stop.`
`{n}.........Father's......Golden Land...!!`
`I calmed my throbbing heart, somehow regained my composure, and readied the gun again.`
`...But since, in the end, I couldn't open the door with my gun held in both hands...`
`......I lowered the gun, carefully erased my breath, and opened the door......`
`"..................I‐......isn't this......inside the......?!"`
`My first impression when I saw the room...`
`...was to question whether it might have been connected to one of the rooms in the mansion.`
`Yes, this place had exactly the same atmosphere about it as the forbidden VIP room on the second floor.`
`But this was underground, so there were no windows.`
`{n}There was only the solemn light of a grand chandelier.`
`But the quality of the interior, dimly lit by the faint light,`
` was more than enough to take your breath away.`
`A bed with a canopy, and a rocking chair that looked like it would be very comfortable to sit in.`
` An extravagant sofa and carpet.`
`The room was like a dream every girl yearns for at least once...`
`And yet, since it was an underground hidden room with no windows,`
` it actually felt more like it could be the hidden house of a witch.`
`I had never swallowed the legend of {f:5:Beatrice}, witch of the forest.`
`However, ......if you were shown this room,`
` ......it certainly would become hard to doubt that she actually had existed,`
` and had lived in here.`
`".........Is someone...`
`..................there...?"`
`Although I was dumbfounded by this room, I cautiously,`
` ...no, timidly kept my gun raised, and searched the interior.`
`And......in the center of the room, I found it.`
`"...............Eee—..............."`
`My gasp came out strangely, as though a bunny was being choked.`
`...I mean, ......after finding something like this,`
` ...no one would have any words other than that stupid voice...`
`"It's here......`
` ......I‐......it's really here.........`
` ......Father's......gold......!!"`
`On the opposite side of the canopy bed, it was piled up in a massive heap...`
` A mountain, a mountain of gold ingots!!`
`Of course, they weren't piled up carelessly in a way that would damage the dignity of this room.`
`A beautiful scarlet satin weave was laid on the mountain of gold,`
` creating a beautiful three‐colored mix between the red, the gold, and the black of the deep darkness...`
`It was as though, when the witch slept on this bed,`
` the gold would be a respectful chamberlain waiting on her.`
`Nobly, refinedly, gracefully, beautifully.`
`{n}It was piled there with an imposing and yet ceremonious air...`
`I tried to grab a single gold ingot and was surprised at its weight.`
`{n}......It was probably about ten kilograms.`
`......Just this one ingot would easily be worth ten million without a doubt.`
`The Ushiromiya family crest, the One‐winged Eagle, was lightly imprinted on it.`
`It was hard to tell whether it had worn away, or whether the impression had been made carelessly in the first place,`
` but it was certainly the crest of the One‐winged Eagle.`
`Just how many ingots are piled up here?`
`Just by roughly multiplying both sides, and multiplying that by the height, it must surely come to over several hundred.`
`My mind's already blank... I can't calculate it properly.`
`{n}......Even a conservative count would put it easily above a billion yen.`
`"Well, of course... Of course it would be...`
` ...I mean, it's ten tons of gold...`
` At the current value, it's more than 20 billion yen of gold...`
` I, ...I found it, ......before anyone else, .........I found it!!`
` Ahaha, wahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha, ahah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`In front of the mountain of gold, I spread my arms and looked up at the ceiling.`
`{n}A laugh without a trace of dignity flowed out from my entire body.`
`I had no intention at all of laughing in such a weird way,`
` ...but I just, I just couldn't hold back the happy feeling that flowed throughout my entire body.`
`......That older brother of mine probably wouldn't accept his loss just because I had found this gold.`
`...But from now on, there would be no changing the fact that I had been the one to find the gold...!`
`To steal the headship of the family, I would still probably need some subtle tactics.`
`But after everything I've gone through until now, that's a completely trivial problem.`
`Even if I lose out on the inheritance of the Ushiromiya family and everything...`
`{n}...this 20 billion yen's worth of gold is now mine and mine alone!!`
`"Hahahaha, a‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!!`
` There was a time when I thought of money as such a worthless thing.`
` I thought, there are so many things in this world that you can't buy with money."`
`"...But now I understand that that's just a lie!`
` It was just an excuse that have‐nots make for themselves!!"`
`"With this mountain of gold before me, I've finally realized something so obvious...!!`
` I can give birth to all the happiness in this world by melting this gold!`
` With this money, my husband's company is fine now.`
` We will always be happy as a family.`
` And I can even leave a vast amount of money to George...!!"`
`"The rest of the relatives will eventually be ruined and disappear.`
` At that time, George will use this gold, and revive the Ushiromiya family's lost honor,`
` just like Father did...!!`
` There will be no room for anyone to argue then.`
` ......George is the true successor of the Ushiromiya family!!"`
`It happened!!!`
` My wish was granted!!`
`That dream I have wished for ever since I was born into this world as Ushiromiya Eva, has been granted completely in this very moment...!!`
`My husband and I will be happy for all eternity.`
` And I can also give my only son, George, eternal happiness!!`
`There's no way I'll waste it on foolish pleasures!!`
`{n}My older brother has chewed up the Ushiromiya family, but George and I will revive it!`
`And that means that we truly have succeeded the headship of the Ushiromiya family!!`
`"I succeeded...`
` I did it, ...honey......George...`
` ......I, ......your mother......finally succeeded...`
` ......After this, we won't be threatened by anyone...`
` Uuuhhu, uuuuUUuuuUUugghhuhuu!!"`
`That's right, after this, never again will we be smothered by sad nights.`
`Congratulations, me.`
`Congratulations, Ushiromiya Eva.`
`......Right here, right now, the sad half of our life has had its heart's desires granted.`
`"It's all thanks to you...`
` I was blessed with this chance because of your magic.`
` Because of that chance, I was able to make it here...!"`
`...Thank you.`
` But my magic couldn't have been granted if we both didn't believe in each other.`
`So it isn't just the power of my magic.`
`This is our victory.`
`So, congratulations,`
` "us".`
`"Thank you, me...`
` Thank you, Ushiromiya Eva...`
` ......I'm so glad I didn't give in before now.`
` I'm so glad I didn't drown in sorrow and forget to keep struggling..."`
`".........No, this is my magic.`
` Our magic!`
` Your magic was the real thing.`
` {f:5:Beatrice} the witch of the forest is nothing more than an illusion.`
` {i:You} are the real witch, who can use real magic.`
` ......That's right.`
` Right now, {i:you} are the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!"`
`Eva decided to leave that place for the time being.`
`{n}And when she climbed the stairs again, trying to leave this secret place...`
`......She saw a creepy, swaying human shadow blocking her path, and her dreamlike state was blown away.`
`".....................Who's there?!"`
`For an instant, ...she believed that the true master of this room, the real {f:5:Beatrice}, had appeared.`
`It seemed that the other person was also holding a gun.`
`{n}The two of them were pointing guns at each other.`
`And eventually, they each realized who the other was...`
`".........Rosa.........?"`
`"...Nee‐san...`
` .........What are you doing in a place like this...?"`
`"I could ask you the same.`
` What business do {i:you} have in a place such as this?"`
`"......I shouldn't have given you that hint, Nee‐san.`
` If I hadn't, I definitely would have been the first to reach this place.`
` .........Too bad."`
`It seemed that Rosa knew where this staircase went,`
` and what was waiting ahead of her.`
`"That's rich.`
` .........Coming from someone who arrived here after me."`
`".........I racked my brains too much over the sweetfish river.`
` The sweetfish part didn't really matter that much at all, did it?"`
`"That isn't true.`
` It was an excellent hint, if you ask me.`
` Well, of course, maybe there was no need for it to be sweetfish.`
` ...But when I heard that sweetfish are fish that go out into the sea, I was able to figure it out."`
`"......What is inside?"`
`"Why not see with your own eyes?`
` It definitely won't betray your expectations."`
`"........................`
` ......Don't be afraid, Nee‐san.`
` I never had any interest in who became the head.`
` I don't even care about the Ushiromiya family name.`
` ......Honestly, Krauss nii‐san always did throw his weight around, saying that he was going to be the head,`
` so I actually feel good about you stealing the position from him."`
`"............Are you serious?"`
`"Of course.`
` I am the outsider of the Ushiromiya siblings.`
` ......Even if Father had named me as the next head,`
` there's no way my brothers would accept that.`
` I try not to have such naive dreams."`
`"........................"`
`"Let me see too.`
` The proof of your victory, Nee‐san.`
` ......As long as I receive the proper portion that we agreed upon as siblings,`
` I plan to actively accept you as the true victor in this "game"."`
`"............If you shot me, then you would have this gold all to yourself, right?"`
`"It's the same for you.`
` If you shot me, this gold would all be yours."`
`"......................................."`
`For a tense while, the sisters pointed their guns at each other.`
`{n}Eventually, after they sized up the glint in the other's eyes, they lowered their guns.`
`...Eva removed her finger from the trigger, and held the gun upside‐down.`
`It was a position that she couldn't quickly shoot from.`
`{n}When she saw that, Rosa held hers the same way.`
`"......That's right.`
` That plan of shooting the other and having all the gold to ourselves is fascinating for both of us."`
`"...But if one of us suddenly disappeared on this island while it's isolated by the typhoon, there would be a huge uproar.`
` ......If we hid the corpse here, it probably wouldn't be found easily, but that isn't for certain."`
`".........No matter how many billion yen's worth of gold is on the line,`
` it isn't worth the risk of committing murder.`
` In the end, that would become a weakness for Krauss nii‐san and the others to squeeze all the money out of us with."`
`"I agree.`
` ......Considering that Nii‐san or Rudolf could have been the one to show up here,`
` ......it may have been a blessing in disguise that it was you.`
` ...I trust you the most of all the siblings."`
`"............Thank you.`
` I also trust you the most of the siblings, Nee‐san."`
`"...................................."`
`"............I want to see the gold too."`
`"Do you?`
` Now I also want to see it again.`
` Even though I saw it with my own eyes, it still doesn't feel real.`
` ...Unless I see it together with you and check once more that it actually exists,`
` it feels like the gold will turn to fog and disappear."`
`Eva started descending the staircase once more.`
`{n}......However, she didn't carelessly expose her back to Rosa.`
`Likewise, even though at a glance it looked like Rosa had lowered her guard, she definitely didn't show any signs of carelessness.`
`......And they reached that room of the witch once again.`
`{n}Rosa also gasped, made speechless by the vast amount of gold...`
`......Rosa and Eva walked absentmindedly through the rose garden.`
`They had left the guesthouse secretly, so they had to be careful when they returned as well.`
`They had to regain their sense of tension soon.`
`"......Congratulations, Nee‐san."`
`"Thank you."`
`"You decided it, didn't you?`
` Fifty percent goes to the bearer of the title of successor to the head.`
` ......It sure did work out well for you.`
` That doesn't refer to Krauss nii‐san anymore.`
` ...So your share is now fifty percent along with a quarter of the rest, for a total of 12.5 billion yen."`
`"Isn't that an incredible share?`
` ...I'm satisfied with 2.5 billion.`
` Rudolf nii‐san won't complain either.`
` Krauss nii‐san will probably be the only one to complain."`
`"......Yeah, you're right.`
` ...After all, Nii‐san is the practical manager of Rokkenjima.`
` And since the gold was on these premises,`
` even though I was the first to discover it, things might get complicated if I don't handle it skillfully."`
`"It won't get complicated.`
` We covered this and every other eventuality in excruciating detail in last night's discussion, didn't we?"`
`"............I wonder if it will really go that smoothly.`
` I've already completely gotten over my excitement.`
` How we regulate everything from here on is the real problem."`
`"...That is a problem for the new head of the Ushiromiya family.`
` You should enjoy that problem, Nee‐san.`
` It has nothing to do with me."`
`"Hmm, sharp words..."`
`"......I'll support you as the second person to find it.`
` So please at least give me the early payment we decided on.`
` I'd like 150 million yen by March."`
`"Yes, that's fine.`
` ......If you support me, I can graciously pay you that much.`
` I am not Nii‐san."`
`"Anyway, why don't we go and shock Nii‐san and the others?`
` Even if we cover up the actual location, I want to see Krauss nii‐san's shocked face as soon as I can."`
`"...............`
` ............Wait a second, Rosa.`
` Wait a while before telling everyone about it."`
`"..................Huh?`
` ...Why?"`
`"...You idiot, isn't it obvious?`
` ...This is that haughty Krauss nii‐san and that sly Rudolf we're talking about.`
` Even if we announce it eventually, it's still too early now."`
`"Unless we carefully investigate how we should move things along first,`
` it's possible that all of the gold we've finally found will be snatched away by Nii‐san."`
`Eva had thought she had just said something completely obvious.`
`...So when she saw Rosa's expression suddenly cloud over, she was a little surprised.`
`"......What are you unsatisfied about?`
` You know well what kind of people those two are."`
`"...............`
` Nee‐san, that's against the rules."`
`"What do you mean?"`
`"......Didn't we make a rule that whoever found the gold would announce it immediately?`
` If you hesitate, the foundation of the rules will be destroyed,`
` and that could lead to something worse in the future.`
` ...With Krauss nii‐san as crafty as he is,`
` that violation of the rules will complicate things later."`
`"Don't be stupid.`
` This is Nii‐san's island.`
` And that gold just now wasn't cash.`
` We're talking about the liquidation of a vast ten‐ton mountain, you know?"`
`"It will take a significant amount of time to carry it off and turn it into cash.`
` And that will only work in Nii‐san's favor, since he has practical control over this island.`
` Don't you even realize that?!"`
`".....................I don't like searching each other for weaknesses like that.`
` I just want to clearly lock in my 2.5 billion portion."`
`"Of course, if you were to give me 2.5 billion in cash right now,`
` whatever you did next would be up to you.`
` But until I have my share in my own pocket, I will follow the siblings' rules."`
`"You're so naive...`
` You don't understand Nii‐san's craftiness at all!"`
`......It wasn't that Rosa didn't understand the craftiness of her older siblings.`
`In that sense, Rosa more or less understood Eva's caution.`
`But in her heart,`
` she couldn't clear away her even greater suspicion that Eva wanted to keep all of the gold to herself.`
`......Because she knew that Eva was at least as crafty as her other siblings, if not more.`
`In other words, by quickly informing the siblings of the gold's discovery,`
` Rosa wanted to put a stop to any chance Eva had to keep the gold all to herself...`
`"..................`
` ......Rosa.`
` Sorry, but at least listen to me this once."`
`".........Are you saying that if I don't listen to what you say, you won't be able to prepare the 150 million?"`
`"........................`
` ...That isn't the way I wanted to say it.`
` ...But if you really need that money, it's more realistic to support me.`
` ......If you talk to Nii‐san and Rudolf, even that natural portion of yours might disappear.`
` You don't want that, do you?"`
`"........................"`
`For a while, a severe expression that she had never shown to her sister before rose to Rosa's face.`
`There wasn't even a trace of her restraint as a younger sister.`
` ......There was just the ruthlessness,`
` no, the seriousness of a single human arguing about a vast sum of wealth.`
`Eva made light of it, chuckling.`
`"......Dear me.`
` A frightful murder has just taken place, and the culprit still may be on this island...`
`how careless we must be to stand around here talking like this."`
`"I'm sure it's just the servants' farce.`
` No murder ever occurred on this island."`
`"......Oh?`
` So you really do think that?"`
`"It can be clearly explained by the manner of the six deaths.`
` The locked room involving those six definitely couldn't be created by a crime from the outside."`
`"......Doctor Nanjo said that they were all dead, but that was also a lie.`
` This is all a complicated act that Father plotted.`
` All of the servants are just pretending to be dead.`
` ...A murder never occurred in the first place.`
` There's no way that there's a murderer prowling around."`
`"...Huh...`
` I'm surprised that you would notice that.`
` You looked fairly frightened, so I hadn't thought that you realized that much."`
`"......I'm a person who can read between the lines in that kind of situation.`
` Thanks to you, I've been well trained."`
`That's right.`
` Before we realized it, the servants had "died", and the members of the Ushiromiya family had become the only ones on this island.`
`And after Nanjo had proclaimed the "deaths" of the servants,`
` and the relatives had begun to discuss the riddle of the epitaph, he had disappeared off upstairs as though he was in the way...`
`"Everything...`
`was an act to get us to challenge that epitaph.`
` ......And that's exactly why...`
`you need to proclaim that you are the victor, Nee‐san."`
`"There's no way that burnt corpse is really Father.`
` ......He prepared a corpse with the right number of toes from somewhere, and deliberately burned it in that horribly morbid way."`
`"......I'm sure he's hiding somewhere, watching to see how we'll behave.`
` ...I'm sure he already knows that you have reached the Golden Land, Nee‐san."`
`"......And that's why you should proclaim soon that you are the winner.`
` I'm sure Father will appear out of nowhere and proclaim that you are his successor while clapping his hands."`
`"........................"`
`"...Well, still.`
` ......I have to pester you for 150 million,`
` so I can't work against you in anything."`
`".........So you'll listen to what I say, and be quiet about this to Nii‐san and the rest...?"`
`"...................................."`
`"......Make your position clear.`
` ...Rosa."`
`"...............I want to tell them.`
` We just made that rule last night.`
` We shouldn't just throw that away."`
`"Of course, I will announce it in front of the siblings.`
` ...However, I want to make very sure of the situation first.`
` Carrying out ten tons of gold, converting it into money,`
` and distributing it fairly."`
`"......Until I can affirm my ability to carry those out without Nii‐san getting in the way, I want some time to think.`
` I only want to hold off my announcement until then.`
` .........I'm definitely not keeping it secret because I want it all for myself."`
`"..................`
` ...You'll definitely announce it to everyone sooner or later, right?"`
`"...Yes, of course.`
` Even I want to rub it in Nii‐san's face as soon as I can."`
`".........About how much time will you need to "think"?"`
`"I won't know that until I've thought about it."`
`"............Would one night be enough?"`
`"I can't promise you that it will take only one night...!"`
`"Out of respect for you as the successor to the head, I will support you for one night.`
` ......This year's family conference will end tomorrow morning, when the typhoon passes and a boat comes to get us.`
` ...That's right, when the seagulls cry.`
` ......I will remain silent until then."`
`"If you think that you need more time to think after that, ...let's talk about it again at that time, alright?`
` .........I will support your position...`
`{i:as much as possible}."`
`"......You......really are cunning, aren't you?`
` ...I'm surprised.`
` Were you always this strong‐willed?"`
`"......It's true that women become stronger when they have a child.`
` I realized that in myself when I had Maria."`
`"...............`
` Alright.`
` I thank you for your cooperation for the time being.`
` ...We can talk about tomorrow when it comes."`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` ......I believe that you will be a fair‐minded successor to the head, who wouldn't even think of taking all of the gold for herself."`
`"...Isn't that obvious!`
` ......I will split the gold evenly among the siblings as we agreed."`
`No way. {i:I} found this.`
`Because I, because we solved the riddle of the epitaph!`
`So this gold is all mine...!!`
`"I won't give it up to anyone!`
` I am the head of the Ushiromiya family!`
` I am, {i:I} am!!"`
`In a loud voice, the witch inside Eva claimed exclusive possession of everything.`
`{n}...Of course, that didn't come close to reaching Rosa's ears, and it probably didn't even reach Eva's, either.`
`"......Mm.`
` I shall acknowledge that.`
` You are the true head of the Ushiromiya family, chosen by the witch's epitaph.`
` Now, I shall acknowledge that upon my name."`
`"...Y‐`
` .........you are.........`
` That outfit...`
`you couldn't be...`
`......really...`
`{f:5:Beatrice}......?"`
`Maybe {f:5:Beatrice} was happy that Eva had called her by her own name.`
` She cackled pleasantly.`
`In concert with that laugh, gold butterflies rose up as though a storm of gold dust had broken out in the room,`
` and the room shone the color of gold...`
`"Indeed.`
` I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......*cackle*cackle*, there is nothing that should frighten you so.`
` I am praising your exploits.`
` ...Truly excellent.`
` Imagine that you would spectacularly solve that riddle of the epitaph...`
` It is worthy of my admiration...!"`
`"...You were the one who sent that letter?`
` So I'll succeed all of the gold and the Ushiromiya family inheritance, right...?`
` You wrote that in your letter.`
` And I overcame that challenge...!"`
`"Mm.`
` I shall acknowledge it.`
` Now, all of this piled‐up gold, and everything of the Ushiromiya family, is for you to do with as you please.`
` For as of this moment, you are already the Ushiromiya family head."`
`"R‐......really?`
` It's true, right?`
` Right?!"`
`"Do not become agitated.`
` I am openly praising you.`
` As proof, I shall grant you this."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} took a ring off of her own finger,`
` and held it out to Eva.`
`She fearfully accepted it,`
` ......and realized that it was a ring.`
`"......C‐`
`......could.........`
`this be............"`
`"Mmhm.`
` It is the proof of the Ushiromiya family headship, returned to me from Kinzo: the Golden Ring."`
`"From now on, it is yours.`
` You may put it on your finger and display it high before your siblings.`
` None should doubt that you have now succeeded the Ushiromiya family inheritance."`
`Eva stared closely at the ring.`
`...It certainly wasn't a fake.`
` ...Without a doubt, it was the real thing.`
`She, who had dreamed of receiving this ring someday,`
` and who had stared fixedly at it countless times, could say that for certain.`
`This ring...`
`had now designated her as its new owner,`
` ......and had been handed over to her......`
`And...`
`timidly...`
`she put it on the middle finger of her left hand...`
`In that instant, ......she felt a deep emotion welling up inside her that she had never felt before.`
`Her mind grew blank.`
` Both eyes opened wide.`
`{n}That ring...was on her own finger.`
`{n}Not in a dream, in reality............!`
`"That ring is surely also pleased.`
` Because it was able to come to you, who had dreamed of putting it on your finger for so long."`
`"......The ring...`
` ......Father's`
`......ring...............!"`
`"How many nights have you dreamed of putting that on your own finger as you have now done?`
` ......The strength of those feelings became your magic and made that reality.`
` Now, you are worthy of calling yourself a true witch."`
`"............Wh‐...who are you?`
` ...Are you really......{f:5:Beatrice}......"`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` I am the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}!`
` The Ushiromiya family alchemist!"`
`"Following my contract with Kinzo, I now pass everything on to you.`
` ...All of the gold I entrusted Kinzo with.`
` And all of the wealth he built up through that.`
` And the honor and inheritance of the Ushiromiya family.`
` And I will pass on my power, and the title of the Endless Witch."`
`"......A witch's...`
`...title......"`
`"I will pass on all of my magical power, and the titles of the Golden Witch and the Endless Witch.`
` ......Following my Predecessor, I will hand over my name, {f:5:Beatrice}, along with those titles.`
` ......You may now call yourself by that name!"`
`Eva gulped.`
` The chandelier light, which had seemed dim, now felt too bright.`
`"By my name, I shall now carry out the succession of the Golden Witch...!"`
`The instant that {f:5:Beatrice} made that proclamation, a golden brilliance buried everything,`
` ......and changed it into a majestic space that looked like a throne room.`
`In the throne room, there was a crowd of {f:5:Beatrice}'s minions and brethren, as well as countless gold butterflies,`
` celebrating this first succession ceremony in a thousand years.`
`And there was {f:5:Beatrice}, in the throne that only the Endless Witch was permitted to sit in, holding a golden staff,`
` reigning with a dazzling dignity.`
`Without being ordered by anyone, Eva automatically kneeled, hanging her head...`
`A goat attendant respectfully offered {f:5:Beatrice} a golden staff modeled after the One‐winged Eagle.`
`After {f:5:Beatrice} stood up and received that staff,`
` she lay the tip of it on Eva's shoulder and spoke.`
` It was a proclamation one thousand years in coming.`
`"Ushiromiya Eva.`
` You have spectacularly solved the riddle of the witch's epitaph, and reached this Golden Land.`
` ......I praise that accomplishment,`
` and hand over all of the Endless Magic as well as the titles of the Golden and Endless Witch."`
`"From this point on,`
` you may take my name, {f:5:Beatrice}...!`
` Come, raise your face.`
` Then stand and accept this staff...!"`
`"I, ......I am most grateful..."`
`Eva stood up dizzily and took the magic staff from {f:5:Beatrice}'s hand.`
` Her hand was trembling slightly.`
`As soon as she grasped that staff...`
`{n}......she was wrapped up in the brilliant sparkle of gold.`
`{n}As though gold butterflies were flowing out from inside of her.`
`In the instant she succeeded the Golden Witch, Eva felt something in the depths of her soul be reborn.`
`To describe it in a word, it was energy.`
`{n}Energy with a gold color.`
`It felt as though she had been half asleep ever since she was born,`
` ......and had now awoken for the first time in her life.`
`For the first time in her life, she felt her true eyes inside her eyes open.`
`".........Mm.`
` A fitting and beautiful outfit for the Golden Witch."`
`"Come, show yourself to all of these people.`
` Show them that you are now the new witch...!"`
`Eva, ......no, the new {f:5:Beatrice} turned around timidly.`
`When she did, the witch's minions, which filled the vast throne room,`
` honored her with a wild applause that sounded like the roaring of the sea......`
`"Come, everyone.`
` Replace all of the portraits of {f:5:Beatrice} with the new {f:5:Beatrice}!`
` Offer up words of celebration for the new {f:5:Beatrice}...!!"`
`"New {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Congratulations on the succession of the Golden Witch.`
` ...I hope that you will become able to stand on your own as a noble Golden Witch, and as the Endless Witch."`
`"Y‐.........yes, ...I will do my best..."`
`"I expect a composure fitting for the Endless Witch from you, unlike your naughty predecessor.`
` Hoh‐hohohohoho."`
`"Masteer, we're in the middle of a serious ceremony, so please, enough of thaaat..."`
`"Congratulations on the succession of the Golden Witch.`
` New {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"......I am called Ronove.`
` I am one of the 72 demons permitted to serve the Golden Witch.`
` From now on, I will always be at your service.`
` If you are ever inconvenienced in the slightest, please let me know at once."`
`"......Th‐......thank you......"`
`"Ronove is rude but reliable.`
` If you speak to this man of anything that confuses you in your new days as a witch, he should be able to help you."`
`".........And, predecessor {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama,`
` it is a shame that I was not permitted to serve you further, even though we have finally been reunited like this."`
`"......These last thousand years have been very entertaining for me.`
` I deeply thank you."`
`"Mm.`
` ......One thousand years with you wasn't boring.`
` ...Please, take care of the new witch."`
`"Yes.`
` If that is the final order of the predecessor {f:5:Beatrice},`
` ...I, Ronove,`
` shall certainly carry on your wish."`
`"Thank me, 'kay?`
` I signed as your reference for the succession of the witch, you know?`
` So basically, if I hadn't signed, you wouldn't have been able to become the witch.`
` So thank me a little, alright?!"`
`"This is the Witch of Certainty, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` The recommendation of a witch from the Senate was required for your succession as an Endless Witch.`
` Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} recommended you, and became your guardian."`
`"Th‐......thanks......"`
`"......Heyyy, Beatoo!`
` This kid isn't grateful enough!`
` I wanna stop recommending her!"`
`"Being a reference is not a thing to take lightly.`
` If you've signed, then you must take responsibility."`
`"Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} is also the Witch of Certainty.`
` ......The Witch of Certainty prefers to make fate firm, to create a fate of Certainty.`
` She took a great liking to your efforts up to today, and held them in the highest regard."`
`"Well, an unfortunate childhood, unrewarded effort...I can sympathize juuust a bit with those, that's all.`
` It's not like I felt sorry for you or anything, don't get so full of yourself!`
` Tsuun!"`
`"......From my point of view, your succession, well, it's more of a coincidence than a miracle.`
` You wouldn't have been worthy of my recommendation."`
`"*cackle*.`
` This is Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` She is a very hard‐to‐please person.`
` Still, you could say that just having her participate and celebrate is very fortunate."`
`".........I only came because this is a rare event, unseen in a thousand years.`
` And I heard that there would be some delicious alcohol."`
`"New {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` Please, allow us to greet you as well."`
`"Huh, ...ah, ...I'm pleased to meet you..."`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory formed a line side by side.`
`{n}The eldest sister, Lucifer, took a step forward and kneeled.`
`"These are furniture who serve me.`
` As a gift in celebration of your inheritance, I will send them to you."`
`"......After you succeed the Golden Witch, you will need to perform the ritual for your own resurrection.`
` The Seven Sisters of Purgatory perform an essential role in that ritual.`
` ......They're a bunch of miscreants, but they serve their purpose.`
` Have them do whatever you wish."`
`"We will always be by your side, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` Please order us to do anything you wish.`
` We will certainly show that we can accomplish our task...!"`
`Even after that, various nobles and minions visited and offered words of congratulation for the new witch.`
`As she responded to them confusedly,`
` she felt as though she was getting light‐headed due to lack of oxygen.`
`......She couldn't tell if this was something real or unreal.`
`But there was just one thing she could understand.`
` The feeling of achievement at being permitted to call herself the Golden Witch.`
`...That alone was a truth she could definitely understand...`
`"............What......is all this?`
` Of course, I'm not going to swallow this story, ...but what on Earth does it mean?!"`
`"Auntie Eva is the new {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` Are you saying she's become a witch?`
` ......What the hell...!!"`
`"I am also surprised.`
` Imagine that someone would be able to solve that riddle.`
` ......However, that is the rule.`
` I must follow it, and pass on the position of Golden Witch and my name."`
`"It is hardly something to be surprised about.`
` Milady wrote that rule in a letter and announced it at the beginning.`
` ......Eva‐sama was the first to be successful.`
` That is all there is to say."`
`"......{f:5:Virgilia}, are you there?!"`
`"Yes, here I am..."`
`"What does this farce mean?!`
` Even if this depiction of strange witches showing up one after another is some of her bullshit...!`
` ......Isn't this like Auntie Eva has become a witch?!"`
`"Calm yourself.`
` She has simply received the title of "Golden Witch", and might call herself that in the future.`
` ......This succession ceremony is, without doubt, nothing more than that performed according to that child's "interpretation".`
` Don't fall for the same move again."`
`"Th‐...that's right...`
` That whole grand ceremony was all phony.`
` But it's at least a fact that Auntie Eva solved the riddle of the epitaph.`
` ......And at the same time, that means that she inherited the Ushiromiya family headship."`
`"......And by obtaining ten tons of gold,`
` ......it means that Auntie Eva might as well call herself the "Golden Witch"...is that it...?`
` Damn, making things as complicated as ever...!!"`
`"...Dear me.`
` Is a boorish {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} unable to comprehend the grandeur of this ceremony?`
` ......Oh, well.`
` Being unable to read between the lines is what makes you {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` I pity you, but I do not blame you."`
`"Damn it...`
` Don't look at me like you feel sorry for me...`
` .........Still, for the time being, there's something I need to check."`
`"And that's regarding this younger version of Auntie Eva,`
` ...in other words, the definition of this new {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......What the heck {i:is} she?!"`
`"Even if I tell of it, you will just persist in your disbelief in magic and witches, will you not?`
` So there is nothing in particular for me to explain.`
` You may believe that things are as you think they are."`
`"......The way I think things are...?!`
` Then, then how should I interpret this...?!"`
`"For now, grasping it as a visualization of a different being inside Ushiromiya Eva may not be a hindrance, I believe."`
`"...Of course, you cannot blindly accept it, but it is probably appropriate for you to think that way now."`
`"............In, in other words, I should think of Auntie Eva and her as the same person?`
` ......Damn, ...this is starting to feel bad..."`
`"With that being the case, from now on, my name is not {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Because I have passed it on to Ushiromiya Eva."`
`"......Which means that I am nameless!`
` Battleerr, isn't there some name that is fitting for me?`
` I shall take your recommendation!`
` Isn't there a name that's refined, full of elegance, and make it a little cute if you can...!"`
`"...Just "Beato" is good enough for you.`
` There's probably enough of a difference between Beato and {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"Mh...muu.`
` Stay as Beato, is it...`
` It doesn't feel odd, but it's boring for some reason.`
` Muu."`
`"Pu ku ku ku ku...`
` They say the temperature of black tea and a woman's heart are difficult in any time period."`
`".........Battler‐kun.`
` In any case, handle what is to come with composure.`
` Compared to when this child was {f:5:Beatrice},`
` now that we can tell her apart from Ushiromiya Eva, the situation is advantageous to us."`
`"......And it's exactly because of that,`
` ...that I like it even less.`
` ......What is she thinking of?`
` That Beato........."`
`Over there, Auntie Eva,`
` who had the figure of her younger days and who now possessed the name {f:5:Beatrice}, had a long line forming of witches wishing to bless her.`
`It was like a witch's coronation.`
`Countless gold butterflies flapped their wings, directing this fantastical, gold‐sparkling space.`
` They were all praising her.`
`As I stared from the distance,`
` I looked at the {f:5:Beatrice} given new life, who had a slightly embarrassed smile on her face.`
`......Her expression, which had been hesitant at first,`
` seemed to be full of a happiness that she had finally become aware of.`
`In that expression, there wasn't a trace of the madness that had led her to that insane laugh before the gold.`
` There was only the innocence of relishing her joy.`
`Since I deny witches, I couldn't accept her as she showed that joyful expression at her witch succession ceremony...`
`......However, as I watched that innocent smile,`
` ...it made me feel like I wanted to celebrate her, just for now.`
`The moment when a strong effort is successful and rewarded is always beautiful.`
`Auntie Eva, who had always yearned to succeed the head, and had worked hard since she was young without being rewarded,`
` ......had spectacularly taken hold of the chance given to her by the riddle of the epitaph, ...and had finally gained that position.`
`How divine is the smile of a person whose childhood dreams have been granted?`
`I definitely won't accept witches.`
`{n}But, ......Battler put his hands together, making a small sound.`
`Clap. Clap.`
`......It didn't reach her ears, ...but it did celebrate her.`
`".........Congratulations, Auntie Eva."`
`You solved the riddle of the epitaph masterfully, and before anyone else.`
`{n}It's your victory without any complaints.`
`............I won't accept all that about the Golden Witch and so on, but I will accept you as the new head of the Ushiromiya family, and I will celebrate you honestly.`
`"...............Hmph."`
`As though lured by Battler's applause, Beato also clapped.`
`...It was a slightly odd scene.`
` Because Battler and Beato, who opposed each other, were standing next to one another, applauding for the same person.`
`"I'm not clapping for a witch.`
` ...I'm clapping for all of Auntie Eva's efforts up until now."`
`"I am too.`
` I am offering Eva my sincere congratulations in applause for the tremendous accomplishment of solving that epitaph."`
`".........Hmm.`
` ...I don't like the fact that I'm clapping with you.`
` ...But, well, I won't worry about it for now.`
` ...I guess it doesn't hurt to clap with you every once in a while."`
`"Mmhm.`
` It isn't bad once in a while.`
` ......Still, it is fun to applaud.`
` Even though it was Eva who achieved it and not me, for some reason, I'm starting to feel happy too."`
`"That's because celebrating someone means the same thing as empathizing with their joy, and sharing in it."`
`"I see.`
` Then, I must even be sharing this irrational happy feeling with you.`
` ......Since we are a pair of enemies trying to make each other submit, it is an odd experience."`
`"Well, ......just for now, let's have a truce and clap, alright?"`
`Beato laughed impishly, playing around and applauding even louder,`
` as though eagerly trying not to lose to Battler as she clapped.`
`Battler went along with her, and clapped even louder.`
`And when he did, as though he had ended some kind of ceremony, everyone present put their hands together in loud applause, and highly praised the newly born {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`It was just as though Battler's and Beato's applause had been the final thing needed for her succession......`
