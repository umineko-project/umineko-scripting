`The guesthouse lobby had been engulfed by silence.`
`The strings of tension which bound Krauss, Natsuhi, and Eva had already loosened; they were completely tired; and their consciousness was beginning to waver.`
`Every once in a while, they would stand up and walk around pointlessly, fighting their drowsiness.`
`".........Are you alright, Eva‐san?`
` ...Please, do take it easy and rest."`
`"I told you, I'm fine......`
` ...The three of us are now the only adults...`
` There's no time to rest...`
` I'll guard this place even if I have to go through hell and high water......`
` ......haah......haah......"`
`She spoke a brave line, but she couldn't hide her rough breathing.`
`{n}...It seemed that the fever, which had been calmed with medicine for a time, had returned.`
`It was very obvious that Eva's condition was not good.`
`"Don't push yourself.`
` At least close your eyes.`
` If we have to wake you, we definitely will."`
`"I'm telling you that I'm fine...!`
` Leave me alone......!!"`
`".............................."`
`It seemed that she had now become stubborn.`
` ......Krauss and Natsuhi realized that no matter what else they said to her, in her current state, it wouldn't reach her ears.`
`So they decided to say nothing more, and to let her be.`
`To Eva right now, even an argument like that was putting a burden on her.`
`{n}It would probably be better for her if she just sat there with her mouth closed.`
`As a matter of fact, Eva was already on the point of succumbing to her drowsiness.`
` ...She might have talked back with a temper because she was trying to encourage herself and throw off her sleepiness.`
`The clock would very soon be pointing to six in the afternoon.`
`Because she had been snacking over and over again to fool her drowsiness, she didn't feel hungry,`
` but instead, her lack of sleep made it feel like it was six in the morning rather than the afternoon.`
`......Even supposing that the boat would come at precisely nine in the morning tomorrow,`
` ......there were still more than twelve full hours to go.`
`...That was a dizzyingly long stretch of time.`
`............Long.`
` .........Painful......`
` ......Hot...`
`Even the sound of the clock torments my body now.`
`In times like this, ......he would put his hand on my forehead, and the fever would always fade at once.`
`...But he isn't here anymore.........`
`As Eva's mind grew foggy, she was once again gripped by a deep sadness...`
`She had already cried herself dry.`
`{n}Even so, the sadness from losing her beloved husband had not been exhausted...`
`"...............I...`
`...was wrong..."`
`"...Why?"`
`Originally, the new witch had been the same being as Eva.`
`{n}...If Eva talked to her, she would always respond...`
`"......If I could only gain the position of family head, ...that was always enough.`
` ......But as soon as I saw that mountain of gold, my greed grew.`
` ............I was struck with a desire to have that mountain of gold all to myself......"`
`"That's nothing to be embarrassed about.`
` After all, it's your natural right as the Ushiromiya family head.`
` How could you give up even a bit of it to anyone else?"`
`"............I was gripped by that temptation, ...which is why you were born.`
` ......While you are the heart of my young self,`
` ......at the same time, you are also my self‐centered evil heart."`
`"......It's my foolish greed, which sprouted thanks to that mountain of gold,`
` ......that allowed you to break out of the shell of my heart, ...and be born into this world...`
` .........I'm to blame for giving birth to you......!"`
`"In that case, when I killed Rosa and Maria,`
` and then Rudolf, Kyrie and Hideyoshi, you were to blame for that too."`
`"Why did you kill my husband too...?!`
` Why......?!!`
` Uuuuuhghuuhuhhuu!!"`
`"...I didn't want to kill Hideyoshi.`
` He was just so annoying and persistent.`
` ...And that's our, no, your fault.`
` It's your fault for choosing a husband like that."`
`"A child like you can't possibly understand how good he was!!`
` Uuuughh{0}hhu{0}uuhu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}uughh...{0}honey.........uuu{0}u{0}u{0}uuhhuhghh{0}hhu{0}uhuu{0}huu!"`
`".........Come on.`
` Our dreams were made real with magic, right?`
` We solved the riddle of the epitaph.`
` And we found the gold and got the Head's Ring.`
` All of our dreams came fully true, right?`
` What more could you want...?"`
`"Those weren't the only dreams I had...!!`
` Living a wonderful life with that man, and entrusting George with an excellent life...!`
` I still have so many dreams that I need to fulfil, ...as a wife, as a mother...!!`
` And yet, ......and yet......!"`
`"...Those are just extra dreams {i:you} gained after becoming an adult.`
` They aren't {i:our} dreams."`
`"And that is why you're a child...!!`
` It only matters that {i:you} get what {i:you} want?!`
` ......That's right, all of this is my fault...!!`
` Back then, why did I resist doing what Rosa told me to?`
` Why couldn't I announce to all of the siblings that I had found the gold...?"`
`"......It's all because of the ugliness in my heart!!`
` My evil heart, which sprouted out of a desire to have all of the gold all to myself, ......caused you to hatch!!"`
`".........I don't see why I deserve that much hate.`
` Even though the both of us together make up Ushiromiya Eva."`
`"No, that isn't true anymore.`
` And it was you who said it.`
` I am Ushiromiya Eva.`
` And you are the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}...!!"`
`"So just disappear already!`
` Witches are a delusion, a fantasy that can only exist in fairy tales...!!`
` Just DISAPPEAR!`
` Don't ever show yourself to me again!!"`
`"...Oh, ......so that's how it is.`
` ...Alright.`
` I'll disappear from your sight."`
`"...And I am no longer Ushiromiya Eva.`
` From now on, I'm the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...So now I will play however I want."`
`"I'm done caring about you.`
` Why don't you just give up and die forever?!"`
`After having a fittingly childlike tantrum, the witch who had once been another Eva vanished.`
`......Only Eva was left behind in the darkness.`
`{n}And she questioned herself...`
`"Was it me......?`
` {i:I}......killed them......?`
` Did I kill...that person......?`
` ......Did {i:I}......kill...him............?"`
`Now, that question was one she herself would never answer......`
`"...g... *cough*cough*cough*!!`
` *cough*cough*cough*!!"`
`It seemed that, half‐asleep, she had gotten some saliva caught in her windpipe just as she was dozing off.`
` ...Eva suddenly started coughing.`
`"Are you alright, Eva?`
` ...Natsuhi, some water, please."`
`"Y‐yes..."`
`"I, ......I'm alright, okay...`
` *cough*cough*cough*!`
` *cooough*cough*!!`
` I just...choked a bit, that's all......!`
` *cough*cough*cough*!"`
`Eva pushed away Natsuhi's hand as she tried to rub her back, and unsteadily rose to her feet.`
`".........I'm going to wash my face.`
` ...Sorry, I fell asleep.`
` ......When I get back, I'll make some more coffee.`
` .........Extra strong, so that we won't get drowsy until tomorrow morning."`
`"Mm, please do.`
` ......Your coffee fits my tastes more than the one Gohda makes."`
`"I'm pleased to hear that, even if you're just flattering me...`
` *cough*cough*!`
` .........I'll be back soon."`
`Eva exited the lobby, heading for the lavatory.`
`{n}Krauss and Natsuhi watched over her frail back...`
`"......So you do sometimes care for Eva‐san, even though you have always been so much at odds with her."`
`"........................`
` ...Properly speaking, isn't this what an older brother should do...?"`
`"......Yes.`
` I believe it is."`
`"Not just Eva.`
` ......Rudolf, and Rosa too.`
` ...The only ways in which I have acted like an older brother to them are to speak arrogantly and bully them."`
`".........In my own way, I was frantic in my desire to be like my father.`
` ...But I could never match up, and I always vented my feelings on them...`
` However, that is no excuse."`
`"...I probably scarred Eva so deep that it still has not healed.`
` ......I regret it, but even if I apologized after all this time, that would not heal those wounds..."`
`".........If you hold on to that emotion, and continue to hold onto it,`
` ...I'm sure that feeling will come through to your siblings."`
`"......At this point, my only sibling left is Eva."`
`"...............If only...the family you and your siblings were born into had not been the Ushiromiya family......`
`......you might have had a more normal, a more fun sibling relationship..."`
`"...You mustn't say that...`
` .........Eva will probably continue to hate me for her whole life.`
` And she has the right to.`
` ...I intend to resign myself to that and accept it."`
`".....................Dear......"`
`"......Eva,`
` .........I am sorry.`
` ......Of course, you don't have to forgive me..."`
`Of course I won't. Bit late, don't you think?`
`"If you know you're in the wrong, why don't you just give up and die right now and forever?!`
` Do it, Chiester Sisters!!"`
`"45, firing permission received.`
` Reconfirming firing curve, correcting for weather.`
` Data link to 410."`
`"410, data received, firing permission confirmed.`
` Nihihihihi, firing!"`
`Together, the sisters released the readied magic bowstring.`
` A beautiful tail trailed the golden arrow, and it drew a beautiful curve as it flew.`
`It was just like a golden snake.`
`It skillfully avoided a grove of trees and flew towards the front door of the guesthouse.`
`Then it flew into the keyhole of the door and snuck into the guesthouse without any problem at all.`
`The gold snake raced down the hall smoothly, yet as fast as an arrow.`
`Right in front of it was the door to the lobby.`
`It would only need to fly into that keyhole, and Krauss and Natsuhi would be right there...`
`For an instant, Krauss thought he saw the door's keyhole sparkle gold.`
`However, at the same time he strained his eyes to see what it was, that sparkle bent like a whip and attacked,`
` wrapping itself around Krauss's neck.`
`"...............ack.........ahkh—khk—"`
`Just looking at it, the gold snake looked very supple.`
` However, it was as though a wire had tightened around Krauss's neck.`
`And while that snake choked Krauss, it extended even more, and also tightened around Natsuhi's neck.`
`Without even the chance to scream, their eyes bulged as they went into convulsions and then collapsed.`
`"45, hit and kill confirmed.`
` Forming towing curve, correcting adjustment points.`
` Data link to 410."`
`"410, data received.`
` Initiating corpse towing.`
` Two on the line at once nyeh, nihi!"`
`The gold snake began to drag Krauss and Natsuhi's corpses back.`
`......It slipped through the door to the corridor, dragging the corpses, gradually increasing in speed,`
` and in the blink of an eye, it had pulled them outside the guesthouse.`
`So the lobby was still, as though nothing had happened at all.`
`...As though Krauss and Natsuhi had never been there to begin with.`
`Only the sound of the wind and the rain remained, as though feigning ignorance and pretending that they had been the only ones there......`
`"......Sorry, I'm fine now.`
` ...Now, I'll go make some coffee."`
`Eva returned from the lavatory.`
`{n}But no one was in the lobby.`
`Even though they had been in that sofa until the very moment she had choked and gone to the lavatory,`
` they had now gone, as if they had been an illusion from the beginning.`
`"...How careless...`
` ......Where did those two go off together?"`
`Like she was pretending to be in a detective novel, Eva put her hand on the sofa.`
`......She felt a warmth indicating that they had been sitting there until a short while ago.`
`Maybe they had gone to do the rounds or something.`
`For the time being, Eva sat down and waited for their return...`
`Beato and George could be seen in the parlor of the mansion.`
`{n}George was kneeling near Shannon's body as though praying...`
`{n}His face was sincerity itself, and there was even sweat on his forehead.`
`However, Beato was the same.`
` Now that she had handed her name over, most of her previous power had been lost.`
`...Of course, she still had more than enough power to be called a witch, but compared to the past, it was a very faint thing.`
`"......Good.`
` Don't talk to her, don't touch her with your hand.`
` ...Call to her with the voice of your heart; seek her with the hand of your heart.`
` ...Only your strong feelings can make my magic reach Shannon's lost soul."`
`".................................hh."`
`George maintained a single‐minded focus.`
`{n}He kept frantically yelling inside his heart, trying to call back the soul of the person he loved.`
`...He strongly envisioned his soul leaving his body, and searching for her as she wandered through Hell.`
`......Beato turned that strong force into magical power, supplementing her own magic.`
` It was magic that, in the past, she could have performed easily, without anyone's help.`
`...But now, if she didn't rely on someone's help, she wouldn't be able to finish the chant, much less succeed.`
`".........I have forgotten after several hundred years...`
` .........Was magic,`
` ......was resurrection...`
`always this difficult of a magic......?"`
`An even more strained expression than George's had risen to Beato's face.`
`...She was still forgetting this, but the magic to revive a life is fundamentally the ultimate hidden art.`
`It was her previous magical power, giving her the ability to use that magic over and over with a snap of her fingers, that was abnormal.`
`Therefore, the heavy burden to her body and mind was, by rights, absolutely to be expected...`
`"......However, .........the power this one has...`
`is quite considerable, even though he doesn't know magic.`
` ......I see, so he truly is Kinzo's grandchild..."`
`The strong power pouring from George was even large enough to pass as magical power.`
`...At first, Beato thought it was due to the blood of the mage Kinzo.`
`......However, that was probably wrong.`
`{n}...She had a feeling that Battler had taught her that.`
`George's power to feel sorrow for the death of his loved one......arose from the way he had tried his hardest throughout his life,`
` from the warm time spent together with Shannon, and from the size of their shared dream, promising each other their futures.`
`Do humans really live this seriously during their one single life?`
`......Of course they do.`
` To her, a life didn't mean anything more than the difference between the top and bottom of an Othello piece.`
`If the black represented death, then she thought all you had to do was flip it over again and make it white.`
`However, it was just like that broken vase.`
`......To humans in a world without magic, where they can never return it to its original form,`
` ......it is very, very natural for them to bet all their body and soul on that single life.`
`".........So there are times when an Endless Witch, with full command over even life and death,`
` ......is inferior to a finite {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, for whom even death's mountain is impossible to cross......?"`
`Now, the witch acknowledged it.`
`He was able to hold a magical power that could not reside in witches who didn't understand the value of a life.`
`......What is this thing called the Endless Magic {i:for} again?`
`...Even though I call myself the Endless Witch,`
` have I been forgetting what the Endless Magic means...for a whole thousand years.........?`
`She looked at George's expression again.`
` .........His surging earnestness was like a lightning bolt.`
`...Right now, even if George's body was burned, or smashed by a waterfall,`
` he would probably continue to pray for his beloved without minding it, without noticing it.`
`For the first time, ...she showed respect for that power.`
`So in that instant, all magical resistance was lost, and the enormous power of George's feelings turned into magical power in its perfect form......`
`The vase was very, very beautiful, rich with history and value.`
`Even as young as I was, it still forced me to take a deep breath when I witnessed its beauty.`
` ......But that just made me want to touch it.`
`But the vase easily fell and smashed into smithereens.`
`...Like a popped bubble,`
` it felt as though the time when it had possessed a form was just an illusion.`
`It was that fragile, ......that easily lost, that life.`
`I realized that, because of my own foolish curiosity, I had done something that couldn't be taken back.`
`No matter how much I regretted it, no matter how much I apologized.`
`{n}The broken vase would not return to its original form...`
`{n}A lost life will not return to normal no matter what happens.`
`I was frightened by the fact that my own frivolous action, even though it had been frivolous,`
` ...had stolen a life that could never be revived again.`
`And, out of pity for the lost life, I cried.`
`{n}Out of fear of myself, who had made it become lost, I cried even more.`
`I was sure that Grandfather would also cry at the loss of his precious vase.`
`I was sure that all of the people who thought fondly of Grandfather would cry too, when they saw him like that.`
`By just the loss of a single life, the whole world would be filled with so much sadness.`
`......I cried even more at how terrible that would be.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} appeared, and spoke.`
`"Then, Milady.`
` Let us revive this vase with magic.`
` If that will make everyone happy, then the vase and the magic and the spirits...`
`should be happy to lend you their power, and return it to its original form."`
`"Come, Milady.`
` Close your eyes, and say the chant with me..."`
`"Come, try closing your eyes.`
` And try to remember.`
` What form did you have?`
` It was surely a very, very beautiful form.`
` Please, show me that form one more time..."`
`Those words of power powerfully knocked on the door to Hades.`
`Her previous magic had powerfully knocked on the door to Hades in the same way.`
`......However, back then, it was horribly violent, ...and earned the displeasure of the peacefully sleeping dead...`
`However, this time was different.`
` ...It was very powerful, ...but it was very kind and loving.`
`The dead near the door opened their eyes,`
` ......and called out to the other dead that there was a voice calling for someone to come back.`
`...The sadness of that voice calling from the outside touched the hearts of the dead,`
` and trying to respond as quickly as possible, they searched for Shannon's lost soul...`
`And then,`
` .........they found it.`
`{n}They found the casket in which Shannon was peacefully sleeping.`
`It truly was Shannon's soul, sleeping in the land of the dead.`
`{n}......Inside a casket that was covered with rose petals frozen with frost, she was sleeping in peace...`
`The dead silently lifted that casket up.`
`...While it looked like a funeral march at a glance, it had the complete opposite meaning.`
`It was solemn, but filled with joy.`
`...It reminded the long‐forgotten dead...`
`that they continue to be loved even after their deaths,`
` ......and gave them all a warm sense of peace......`
`Then, ...as though guided by a warm light from the heavens, ...Shannon's body floated up out of the casket...`
`The dead watched her go.`
` ......They squinted at that warm light,`
` giving their respect to this unknown member of the living, who had continued to hold onto his love for a person even after her death...`
`Shannon's body was sucked into the light in the heavens, and began to disappear...`
`In the jet‐black darkness of the land of the dead, the faint flickering of gold butterflies could be seen.`
`...It reminded them of the gentle stars in the night sky, which they had long forgotten...`
`"........................hh!"`
`George remembered being told that he must not say anything, and he hurriedly covered his mouth.`
`However, it felt like his heart was trying to jump out of his throat.`
`{n}......Because he had seen Shannon's eyelids shake slightly.`
`And then, ...those eyelids slowly opened.`
` Shannon's eyes were there, but they were still covered in the frost of the land of the dead.`
`However, ......the warmth of the human world...no.`
` ......The warmth of her loved one, who had called her soul back, slowly dissolved that frost,`
` .........and her eyes gradually regained their sparkle.`
`Then, .........her eyes moved, ...and recognized George.`
`"......George......san..............."`
`As her lips shook weakly,`
` ......Shannon definitely said that.`
`The words were very faint.`
`{n}So much so that they normally wouldn't even have reached his ears.`
`......However, George clearly heard them.`
`.........He heard his loved one, his fiancée, the one he loved most who should have been dead,`
` call his name once again...`
`"Shannon,`
` .........Shannon.........`
`can you...`
`...recognize me.........?"`
`"...George‐sa...n......`
` .........Is this...a dream.........?"`
`"No.`
` This isn't a dream.`
` ......See, look, ......even if I pinch, you don't wake up."`
`As George said that, he softly pinched Shannon's cheek.`
`......It was how George had always responded in the past, when Shannon had been surprised by something and had asked if she was dreaming.`
`When Shannon felt the warm touch of George's finger on her cheek...`
`{n}......And when George realized that the warmth of a living person had already returned to the cheek of his beloved...`
`......They both cried.`
`...With what words should a pair of lovers separated by death celebrate their reunion?`
` ......The words of the human world are not enough to celebrate that.`
`In short, they had no need of the words of this world...`
`Shannon sat up, and the two of them simply wordlessly hugged each other.`
`Shannon still didn't have much strength in her, and putting her arms around George's back took all she had,`
` ......so George hugged her tightly to make up for that.`
`To stop her from ever again going to a place beyond his reach,`
` he hugged her so tightly, and yet so gently......`
`Shannon's fingers curled around George's back,`
` ......and on her ring finger indeed shone the engagement ring George had given her.`
`That strong sparkle was absolutely not the sparkle of diamond alone.`
`{n}......There was, without doubt, a magical power there that only the two lovers could possibly feel.`
`It was because that strong light existed...that they had been able to find her casket in the land of the dead.`
`Beato understood.`
`......That ring, ......no.`
`............The couple's feelings, in the form of that ring, had created this miracle.`
`In that moment, George had definitely used magic.`
` Beato had done nothing more than help him along.`
` That magic had a magical power that could only reside in those who knew of the importance of life and trying their hardest.`
`It was the power of a miracle that an Endless Witch could not know, ......that only the power of the {i:finite} could give rise to.`
`By now, she had no choice but to accept it.`
` ......She had to accept that true magic, true magical power...`
`...existed in the place farthest away from she who called herself a Great Witch.`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice}...sama......"`
`"......She brought you back to life...`
` Thank you, {f:5:Beatrice}...!"`
`"No.`
` I could not do anything.`
` ......What revived Shannon...was your magical power.`
` Your magic.`
` ............I have indeed witnessed here the Ushiromiya blood, capable of achieving miracles."`
`".........George‐san was the one who......brought......?"`
`"...Mm.`
` .........He had a phenomenal magical power, so much so that I could not reach up to his feet.`
` ......So I still have not left the level of apprentice, then.`
` ...Now I finally know my place."`
`Beato staggered backwards.`
`{n}...Her physical strength was clearly exhausted.`
`She had humbly said that George's power alone had revived Shannon, but Beato had also used all of her magical and physical strength.`
`...And she reflected upon how difficult it was to revive a single one of these lives,`
` which she had toyed with however she wanted in the past.`
`The couple kept each other in their tight embrace, and showed no signs of letting go.`
` ...Feelings that couldn't be communicated with a billion words were thus communicated between them...`
`"Thank you, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...We are in your debt..."`
`"...Thank you very much, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` ......I will never forget that it was you who let me meet with George again."`
`"......Enough, enough.`
` Being thanked by a pair of lovers is far too embarrassing for one who has been feared as an extreme savage.`
` ......Don't worry...about me.`
` ...Take all the time you want.........celebrating your reunion together........."`
`Beato, who was leaning her back against the wall, slid down the wall, and sat.`
` How many centuries had it been since she had last grown this tired from using magic?`
`......Probably, not since the time I first succeeded in magic.`
`.........Didn't Master praise me for that back then?`
`Oh, but, I myself killed that master who praises me, didn't I...`
`......Don't be naive, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`...In the end, that's what it means to kill something, right...?`
`"......Finally,`
` ...it seems you've remembered how to use magic."`
`"...............My whole head...feels parched and suffocated, ......and I can't even think, let alone remember...`
` ...Wait, ...didn't I kill you?`
` You shouldn't be appearing..."`
`"You have let me live until now.`
` That is why I can appear like this.`
` ......However, I did not come here to pat you on the head."`
`"......Did you come here just to sneer at how pathetic I am?`
` ......And after all this time, after retiring as a witch and everything, ...if I sit here and have my head patted, I'll be the laughingstock of the other witches......"`
`"That's right.`
` ......Not only are you a full adult, but you boast about having retired from active service,`
` so I am sure that it would be far too embarrassing to tell anyone that you only just now learned how to use magic."`
`"............Yeah.`
` ......Keep it a secret, Masteer..."`
`With a sense of pleasant despondency, Beato gazed at the couple hugging each other.`
`"Love, huh.`
` ...............I'm no match..."`
`"45, data received.`
` Firing preparations complete.`
` Ammo selected, now loading."`
`"410, firing.`
` Nihi!"`
`The golden serpentine arrow fired by the Chiesters...`
`weaved its way through the bushes in the rose garden,`
` weaved its way through the hedges,`
` and climbed the stone steps towards the mansion's entrance,`
` aiming for the keyhole.`
`It weaved through the corridors,`
` and flew into the keyhole in the door to the parlor...!`
`"......Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh?!?!"`
`It happened in an instant.`
` ...It would have been difficult for Beato, who was completely worn out, to have noticed it beforehand.`
`Right before Beato's eyes, the gold snake that flew in through the keyhole...`
`spun circles around the two lovers,`
` and pierced through their two hearts in a blink of an eye.`
`......And with meticulous precision, that gold snake ran through that hole in Shannon's chest once more...`
`The two had been pierced through the heart by the gold snake,`
` ...no, by the gold sewing thread used by the new brutal witch's furniture,`
` .........and it had only taken an instant, so unfitting for the amount of effort it had taken to revive Shannon...!`
`In front of Beato's shocked eyes, the two collapsed onto the floor...`
`".........G‐`
`......George......`
`.........Shannon..............."`
`"......Thank you,`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice}......`
` ...For letting us meet,`
` ...even just for a short while,`
` ......thank you........."`
`George spent his last breath thanking Beato, and died side by side with the one he loved.`
`The gold snake, which still sewed the two in place, spun like a large cyclone, revolving around the inside of the parlor.`
`.........It was searching for further kills in that room.`
`Then, the tip of the snake met Beato's gaze...`
`{n}In that instant, Beato prepared herself for death.`
`Just then, {f:5:Virgilia} stood in front of her, the fingers of both her hands drawing a mark.`
`In that instant, gold‐colored gold leaf buried the inside of the parlor.`
`{n}It was like a blizzard of gold...`
`"Beato, escape while you can!!`
` {i:No one can escape} from the Chiesters' golden bow!!!"`
`"410, target lost!!`
` Nihyah, magical chaff!!"`
`"45, understood...!`
` Modifying enemy search: personal image homing algorithm.`
` Target reacquired, data link to 410."`
`"410, data received.`
` Too slowww nyeh, Predecessor‐samaa!!`
` Here it comes here it comes here it comes,`
` ...IMPACT!!"`
`The Chiester Sisters' golden bow would not let its kill escape.`
`{n}It would not let them block it.`
`...No magical barrier could even dream of blocking it without being multilayered.`
`The weak point during the instant of confusion caused by {f:5:Virgilia}'s deception magic was Beato's only chance to escape.`
`And the only opportunity to make the sisters confuse {f:5:Virgilia} for Beato.`
`As {f:5:Virgilia} spread her arms wide, blocking the way to her beloved disciple, the gold snake pierced straight through the location of her heart...`
`The snake, which had snuck in through the keyhole, shot through George and Shannon, and then shot through {f:5:Virgilia} in an instant,`
` completely failed to notice as Beato escaped...`
`As soon as {f:5:Virgilia} saw that Beato had gotten away, she expired.`
`......The strength left her body, and like gold dust drifting with the wind, her form was erased...`
`Beato completely erased all traces of her magical power,`
` became gold butterflies, and passed through the wall, escaping to the wind and rain outside......`
`"..................Damn it,`
` .........damn it, damn it...`
` ......You bitch,`
` ......you biii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiitch...!!"`
`Beato felt sick from the bottom of her heart.`
`Why?`
` Because she had been attacked by the new witch?`
`Probably...not.`
` Of course, she also felt sick over the loss of her master.`
`But even more than that, Beato was enraged at the barbarism which had boorishly stolen the union between the two reunited lovers.`
`......Beato had poured out almost all of her magical power to reunite them.`
`...That miracle had been achieved only as a result of all that,`
` ......yet it had taken such a short time to steal it away...!`
`Beato trembled at the barbarous cruelty which had ended it so fast.`
`......And it was also the true form of the acts she herself had committed up until that point...`
`So just as strongly as Beato hated the new witch, she looked at her previous self with disgust.`
`But now she had to escape...`
`{n}......If she was targeted next, she would probably lose her life.`
`And it wouldn't even be funny if the chess player, descended like a god,`
` ended up being attacked and killed by the pieces.`
`"45, impact confirmed, target scattered.`
` ......W‐without a doubt, we crushed the Predecessor...!"`
`"Our pile of kill medals is gonna get bigger yeeeet again nyeh.`
` Nihi!"`
`"What was that about loving couples?`
` You get to enjoy them thrice—once tearing the two apart, once reuniting them, and once tearing them apart again...right?`
` *cackle*hihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hhihi!"`
`"And I feel great about getting to say goodbye to that fussy‐as‐fuck old hag at the same time.`
` ......Ronove, you don't have any complaints, right?"`
`"......Why, of course not,`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"She interfered with the ritual of the witch's epitaph, you see?`
` She revived a sacrifice from the first twilight without permission, and interfered with my ritual.`
` No one has aaany right at all to complain."`
`"Kuhhihihihhyahyahyahya...!`
` Sucks that she doesn't leave a corpse behind though.`
` ......I was thinking of torturing that old hag to death over and over again endlessly.`
` Kuhhi{0}hihya{0}hyahya...!!"`
`"........................"`
`"G‐George did...?!`
` He didn't show up, when did he come down?!"`
`"......Wh‐when...?`
` What time was that, again...?"`
`"I think...it was probably about four or five.`
` ...It was at least an hour ago..."`
`"We got sleepy, and probably dozed off after that...`
` But I think Jessica probably has it right.`
` About one or two hours ago."`
`"I, I also remember it being around that time.`
` Because I was asked whether I wanted more coffee..."`
`Something hard to believe had happened...`
`Apparently, when Auntie Eva had left for a second to visit the lavatory,`
` Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi had disappeared.`
`There's no way they went hiding somewhere.`
` Of course, the doors and windows had all been rigorously checked, and all were locked from the inside.`
` Not one of them was broken.`
`And that wasn't just the first floor—the second floor was the same.`
` Also, all of the doors and windows were designed in such a way that they couldn't be locked from the outside.`
`...In other words, there was no way that Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi had gone outside.`
`{n}......And yet, they couldn't be found.`
`Furthermore, they weren't the only ones who had disappeared......astonishingly, George‐aniki had too.`
`George‐aniki had left saying that he was going to get more coffee,`
` and had gone downstairs more than an hour earlier.`
`I'd been under the impression that he was having a good conversation with Auntie Eva and the rest,`
` ......but Auntie Eva, who had been in the lobby the whole time, said that no one had come down.`
`Since all of the doors and windows are locked from the inside,`
` ...it's hard to imagine that they went outside.`
`......Nevertheless, three humans had evaporated from this barricaded guesthouse, which had become a perfect locked room......`
`It's hard to imagine any reason why they'd hide themselves away for a surprise prank in a situation like this.`
`......It's probably appropriate to think that they've become caught up in this crime...`
`When Auntie Eva learned that her only son was missing,`
` she went half insane, running from room to room and yelling his name loudly.`
`...And Jessica, who had suddenly lost both of her parents, followed suit.`
`Cries of "George, George" and "Mom, Dad" were even now continuing to echo through the guesthouse...`
`I think George said something about wanting to see Shannon's face.`
`......It would be reasonable to imagine that he had snuck out of the guesthouse and gone to the mansion.`
`...However, I don't know about Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi.`
`{n}...Maybe they guessed that's what happened, and went to the mansion to search for him...?`
`Without even telling Auntie Eva...?`
`At this rate, it's only a matter of time before we start talking about leaving the guesthouse to search for them.`
`.........At this point, I'd be in favor of that.`
`We said that shutting ourselves up inside the guesthouse would be safe,`
` and shut ourselves in this morning as a big, happy family of twelve people.`
`And yet, now there are only four people here.`
` ......In other words, being here does not imply safety...`
`However, ...there's something even more important that we mustn't forget.`
`{n}That's the fact that all of the doors and windows were locked from the inside.`
`......This is a locked room.`
`{n}How had they vanished from this place?`
`We'd searched around thoroughly.`
`{n}However, we were unable to find any signs of anyone hiding.`
`...The three of them had almost certainly been taken outside the guesthouse.`
`".........I wonder how they did it...`
` You don't think......there might be something like a hidden door?"`
`"A hidden door...?"`
`"...The doors and the windows are impossible to lock from the outside by construction.`
` Even using a fishing line of some kind, it would probably be impossible with the way they are constructed.`
` In that case, it's probably reasonable to think that they left through somewhere other than a door or a window..."`
`".........You're right.`
` That does make logical sense.`
` ......No one can be sure that no hidden doors exist.`
` ...However, before leaping to that conclusion, I suspect a much simpler possibility."`
`"And...what would that be......?"`
`For some time, Battler had been opening windows, opening the shutters, and checking outside,`
` and repeating this for each window.`
`".........Hmm.`
` ...This window sure is quiet.`
` ...I see, unlike the other windows, the building's construction means that the wind doesn't blow into this one."`
`"It appears that way...`
` It feels strange that no wind or rain comes in, even though there is so much of it outside."`
`"Doctor Nanjo.`
` ...When I opened the window just now, did you hear a sound?"`
`"Huh?`
` ......No, I did not notice it...`
` I believe it is well oiled."`
`"In other words,`
` it would be possible to slink out through this hall window, which no one was watching.`
` Furthermore, the wind doesn't blow in through this window,`
` so the air pressure wouldn't cause the curtains or a door to make a sound.`
` ......It'd be quiet."`
`Battler leaned out and looked at the ground below.`
`{n}...He was searching for some sign that George had jumped down.`
`......But at a glance, he didn't see any mark like that on the grass in the middle of the pouring rain.`
`"......There might also be a window like this on the first floor.`
` It is possible to go outside without anyone noticing."`
`"However, not only the doors, but the windows too were all locked, and the shutters were even down as well, correct...?`
` It is possible to go out, but it would be impossible to lock up..."`
`"But they can be locked, see?`
` Just like this, click."`
`Battler closed the window and locked it, as though this was perfectly obvious.`
`"............B‐......Battler‐san, you aren't saying..............."`
`"If someone inside locked it in the end, this locked room is as easy as pie."`
`"B‐but that means,`
` .........that means,`
` ......ooooooohhhh......"`
`Nanjo turned pale and shook his head several times.`
` ...Because the thing that Battler said was presenting a certain truth to him that was frightening even to imagine...`
`"......That's {i:if} they used the trick I thought of, of course?`
` However, with this trick, only a very limited number of people can be suspected."`
`He didn't want to say it in front of Nanjo, ...but after eliminating Jessica, who had been with him the whole time,`
` ...the only ones who could have done it were Nanjo...and Eva.`
`"I, ...I would not do anything of the sort...!`
` Y‐yes, I can swear it...!!"`
`"......In this case, it would become a battle between Auntie Eva and you for an alibi.`
` ...We'd just have to suspect both of you,`
` and confine the two of you separately."`
`".........To say it the other way around, this might be an effective trick if there were more survivors,`
` but since our numbers have shrunk so much, it isn't particularly effective at all."`
`...No, in fact, there's a chance they could dig their own grave with it.`
`......It should have been more expedient to make it look like the culprit was outside,`
` and to intentionally leave a door unlocked, or break a window...`
`"............If this disappearing act had taken place midday today,`
` I'd have probably announced this theory with full confidence.`
` ...But at this stage, I'm not confident at all.`
` ............What's going on here?`
` ...What the hell does it {i:mean}?`
` .........This "locked room"......"`
`"Y‐......you don't think, umm........."`
`"Hmm?`
` What is it, Doctor Nanjo?`
` ...Even if it's just a thought, please say it."`
`Because Doctor Nanjo looked like he was trying to swallow his words despite having thought of something, I urged him on.`
`After he refused several times, saying that it was just a foolish idea, he finally said it out loud.`
`"......Well, umm,`
` ............you don't think this actually might be...`
`...the work of the witch...?"`
`"R‐...ridiculous.`
` There's no way witches exist."`
`"......The witch is trying to make her case to us.`
` ...She must be showing us that she can do things that humans cannot,`
` ...trying to make us accept her as a witch."`
`"...To me, this disappearance from the locked room of this entire guesthouse......feels like that kind of message from the witch......`
` ............I must not think of it.`
` Surely, it cannot mean anything.`
` ...Oooh, ......I, ...I am frightened......"`
`As Doctor Nanjo shook with fear, it looked like he was he was trying to erase the fearsome thoughts that he kept imagining, one after the other.`
`......When we went downstairs, Auntie Eva and Jessica were enraged,`
` and were each making a lot of noise about leaving this place and searching for their respective families.`
`It was a desire that naturally hits those who can no longer see their family.`
`Auntie Eva told Doctor Nanjo and me to stay here, but I shook my head and started walking.`
`".........I've had enough of being shut up in here.`
` ...I've started wanting to breathe some outside air."`
`"Yeah, and if we're going, let's go right now...!!`
` I'm sick as hell of staying shut up in this place...!!`
` Let's go and find Mom, Dad, and George nii‐san as fast as we can...!!"`
`The blood had all risen to Jessica's head.`
`{n}...I hope it doesn't set off her asthma.`
`"Anyone who wants to stay behind can do that themselves.`
` But we are going to search outside...!"`
`"What about you, Doctor Nanjo...?`
` Gonna watch the place by yourself...?"`
`"N‐no...`
` Please allow me to join you..."`
`If the alternative was holing up alone in a guesthouse whose security was by no means guaranteed,`
` it would be better to be in a danger zone as a group of four people.`
`Auntie Eva was holding the gun.`
` Moving separately from her was almost like asking to be made into the next victim.`
`In this way, the four of us decided to leave the guesthouse.`
`......We'd barricaded ourselves in, saying we'd be safe if we did, ......and then lost eight people.`
`It was almost as though this had been nothing more than a holding cell from which the sacrifices could be killed one after another.`
`We removed the chain, unlocked the front door, and opened it.`
`It was already pitch black out.`
` While there were some lights outside which dimly lit the pathway,`
` ......they didn't have enough power to illuminate the darkness that some suspicious person was likely to be hiding in.`
`"I'm going...!`
` If you fall behind, you're on your own, okay...?!"`
`Still holding her gun, Auntie Eva dashed out without an umbrella.`
`Jessica followed after her.`
`After looking at each other, Doctor Nanjo and I chased after them.`
`...What in the world is happening in this mansion, on this island?`
`Since yesterday, I've just been shut up in the cousins' room in the guesthouse with the rest of my cousins.`
` So I don't know anything about what's been going on outside.`
`Just what has been happening in those places I don't know about...`
`outside the room, in the mansion, and on this island?`
`......Everything is occurring, everything is proceeding,`
` ...and everything is ending without my knowing it.`
`Somewhere in my heart, I had already begun to give up.`
`...Most likely, ......not one of us will see tomorrow morning.`
`When the seagulls cry, none shall be left alive...`
