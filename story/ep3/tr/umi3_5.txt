`"......{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I have been calling to you for a while.`
` Did you not hear me...?"`
`"......Hmm.`
` Were you?`
` My apologies.`
` I was lost in my thoughts.`
` Forgive me."`
`"The weather is pleasant.`
` ...I see, I can understand how the weather has stolen your heart.`
` Will you drink your black tea here...?"`
`"...............Who...am I?"`
`".................................`
` ......I will bring some black tea now.`
` Wait here for a while."`
`"Forget about the black tea.`
` Talk with me."`
`"......Very well."`
`Kinzo had used the excuse of going to bring some black tea to try and interrupt the conversation for the time being.`
` ...But his attempt had been very transparent.`
`I sat in the garden chair, and beckoned Kinzo to do the same.`
`{n}Kinzo sat down heavily, exaggerating his age.`
`For a while, we sat, appreciating the silence...`
`"......Who am I?`
` To this day, no one has answered me this question.`
` ......For some reason, everyone averts their gaze and evades me."`
`"........................"`
`"......I have known you for a long time.`
` I think of you as my best friend, even as a father.`
` ......That is why I want so much for you to tell me.`
` You must know.`
` ...Who I am."`
`"..................`
` ............Why do you worry about something like that?`
` You are {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` The master of this mansion, is that not so?`
` ......What more could you want to know?"`
`"............I do not know."`
`"What's this?`
` ......Don't you even understand yourself what it is you want to know?`
` That is baffling.`
` In my younger days, I sometimes found myself wanting to play in the maze of thought that has no exit.`
` Maybe that is what your worries are..."`
`Kinzo laughed as though it was a trivial matter.`
` ...However, I couldn't help but feel that this behavior was nothing but another attempt to force me to stop my further questioning.`
`"...........................`
` ...Hmph.`
` ......So not even you will tell me that...after all."`
`"There is nothing to tell.`
` You are {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Isn't that more than enough?"`
`"......No, that's not it.`
` ............What I wish to know is not my name.`
` It is...`
`who...`
`I am."`
`"......Who am I, what am I?`
` ...How long have I been here, ...and how long will I continue my days here?"`
`"........................`
` ...I really should bring some black tea.`
` Do you not think it a waste of all this fine weather?"`
`"................................."`
`".........What is this all about...?`
` Somehow, it looks like the story of your past, right?"`
`"It appears so.`
` ...To think that we would go this far back..."`
`"Wondering who you were...`
` ...It looks like you had some pretty high‐minded worries."`
`"......That is to be expected.`
` At the time, I was unable to understand who I was,`
` or why I was alive."`
`"Well, in puberty,`
` everyone is captured by those philosophical worries, wondering what meaning there is to their life, at least once.`
` Doesn't this just mean that you had this kind of charming period once in your life?"`
`".....................`
` ...I had been in that mansion since the time I was born.`
` And I lived only inside the mansion.`
` Of course, I was able to go out into the garden, but the area around the mansion was surrounded by a very tall fence, which I was unable to leave through,`
` and I would be told severely that I mustn't leave."`
`"......I could walk freely throughout the mansion and the garden,`
` but my desire to take just one step outside those of my own accord was never granted."`
`"...............What do you mean by that?`
` ...Are you trying to say that, for as long as you can remember, you were always a bird in a cage?"`
`"......I thought that was just how things were.`
` After all, I had been living like that as far back as I could remember.`
` I didn't even think to question it."`
`"What in the world............are you?"`
`"That's it.`
` That is what I also hoped to know."`
`"............Heh.`
` I'm sure you'll say something like "I wasn't a human, I was a witch", right?"`
`"No, that's not correct.`
` Not {i:yet} correct.`
` ......Or, should I say, it was {i:once} correct.`
` ......I was constructed by Kinzo, a human built by a human.`
` ...No, maybe I should call it a cage made of flesh."`
`"What's that supposed to mean...?`
` ...This is starting to sound weird."`
`"......You probably won't believe it anyway.`
` Listen first.`
` .........I was a great witch who had lived for one thousand years.`
` But at some time, I was summoned by Kinzo,`
` ...and by his hidden arts, I was bound as his prisoner for eternity."`
`"............Never heard that before.`
` From what we hear in the Ushiromiya family, you were summoned by Grandfather,`
` made something like a devil's contract with him, and gave him the gold."`
`"Yes.`
` That is correct.`
` ...Then I was supposed to hide myself until the contract was over.`
` But, .........well, it's tough being a popular woman.`
` .........By some turn of events, Kinzo fell in love with me."`
`"...Grandfather's nearsightedness must have gotten pretty bad.`
` With astigmatism too, ihihi.`
` To fall in love with you, of all things."`
`".........Hmph.`
` Well, to me it was supremely annoying."`
`"...However, the power of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s is a frightening thing.`
` He exhibited fearsome power and rooted me to this place.`
` ...He said I wouldn't be freed until I nodded my head in agreement.`
` ...Such an overbearing man."`
`"Isn't that awesome.`
` Everyone knows Grandfather's obsessed with the occult, but...`
`...who knew he had the power to root down the Great Witch {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"......Heh, ridiculous.`
` You think I'd believe such a weird story?"`
`"...As I thought, you don't believe."`
`"All I believe is the fact that you lived in this hidden mansion in the middle of the forest.`
` You are the 19th person on Rokkenjima, right?!"`
`"......Indeed.`
` Just as you imagine, this is deep in the forest of Rokkenjima.`
` A hidden mansion not to be found from the outside world.`
` Its name is {ruby:Nine Birds' Retreat:Kuwadorian}."`
`"......Come to think of it, I heard that the guesthouse's real name was {ruby:Visitor's Retreat:Toraian}.`
` ...I see, the naming sense is similar.`
` ......So, you were Grandfather's lover, who lived here in secret.`
` Isn't that right?!"`
`"Lover isn't the right way to say it.`
` ......You should probably call it Kinzo's unrequited love.`
` I spoke of it just recently, correct?`
` He fell in love with me of his own accord.`
` He then courted me, but I rejected him."`
`"......Then, I was shut up in this hidden mansion.`
` .........No, I shouldn't say that I was shut up in the mansion.`
` ......It would be more correct to say that I was shut up in this body."`
`"............I have no idea what you just said at the end there."`
`"You will just make fun of it and not listen, right?`
` After all, you say that you don't believe in witches or magic.`
` If you have no ears to hear what I tell you,`
` saying it would be the pinnacle of foolishness."`
`"...........................`
` ......I'll decide whether I believe or not.`
` ...After all, if I don't hear it, the story won't move on.`
` Tell me.`
` ...The story of your past."`
`"Alright.`
` .........I refused Kinzo when he courted me, but he was not a man to lose heart just because of that.`
` He wanted to get my consent no matter what.`
` He shut me up in this mansion, and spent an eternity trying to win my heart."`
`"...He really is overbearing.`
` No one likes a man who can't take a hint, right?"`
`".........*cackle*cackle*.`
` Regardless of whether I responded to his courting or not,`
` to make a man so desperate for me was...well, as a woman, it wasn't unpleasant."`
`"......However, I never nodded my head.`
` I tried what I could to escape his restrictions,`
` but that barrier was firm, and I couldn't break it."`
`"......And then?"`
`"After trying to resist in various ways,`
` I eventually reached the conclusion that, to escape from Kinzo's barrier, I would have to throw away my body of flesh.`
` ......The physical body is a vessel which carries many restrictions in terms of magic."`
`"Throw away your body of flesh......?`
` What's that?`
` Something like an out‐of‐body experience?"`
`"Well, if you want to think of it that way.`
` However, I am not a spirit.`
` Even though I am a witch, in the beginning, I was born with a human's body of flesh.`
` So for me, throwing away that physical body,`
` while it didn't mean the same thing as death, did require a corresponding level of resolve."`
`"So in other words,`
` ......you made up your mind that you couldn't be released except by suicide, is that what you mean?"`
`"It wasn't suicide.`
` It was nothing more than throwing away my body of flesh.`
` ......Of course, becoming nothing more than soul is a precarious situation.`
` When the soul leaves its body of flesh, it is constantly exposed to the strong winds of the sun.`
` It was not easy even for me to maintain myself and avoid being scattered by them."`
`"It was a final measure that I wanted to avoid if I could.`
` However, there was no other way to break through Kinzo's barrier."`
`"......*cackle*, after all, I am a free spirit.`
` I couldn't stand being kept in a cage until Kinzo's life was over."`
`I couldn't understand this story Beato kept going on about, about throwing away her body of flesh,`
` as anything more than suicide.`
`Grandfather persistently courted her, and to escape from that,`
` ......she chose her own death...?`
`"...............So you're saying you committed suicide?`
` What are you saying?`
` Isn't that you, sitting carefree there in the garden chair?"`
`"......That's right.`
` That is the new cage I was given by Kinzo."`
`"............Cage?`
` You mean this mansion?"`
`"No.`
` I mean my body, relaxing in the garden chair over there.`
` .........After I became a soul and tried to escape,`
` even then, Kinzo had no intention of allowing me to escape."`
`"...Yes, indeed, he is a frightening person.`
` Normally, seeing the woman of your one‐sided desires take her own life should be enough to bring anyone to their senses, even if their love was a hundred years old.`
` ......I suppose it makes him somewhat of a mage after all.`
` ......*cackle*."`
`"Don't try to speak in riddles with that incomprehensible witch‐girl talk.`
` ...In short, what are you trying to say?"`
`"That Kinzo didn't let me escape even after I became a soul.`
` ......Human emotions are terrifying.`
` That he would be able to exhibit this much power..."`
`"Tying down a spirit of the dead...`
`is not a level readily attained, even for a mage seeking that as his specialty.`
` Because I knew that, Kinzo's fearful magical power shocked me then for the first time."`
`"............Then Kinzo seized my soul and brought me back.`
` However, a cage to hold a seized soul cannot be made, not from iron nor from lead.`
` ......There is but one exception."`
`"............What?`
` You aren't going to say it was a magical cage or something, are you?"`
`"Wrong.`
` That body of flesh over there, just like yours or mine.`
` ...Only a cage made of flesh and blood can tie a spirit down to this world.`
` ......Kinzo shut my soul up once more into a cage of flesh built to be exactly like me."`
`".....................`
` ...So in summary, is it something like this?`
` Grandfather persistently courted you, you started to hate it, and you committed suicide,`
` but you weren't clever enough to finish the job?`
` ...Damn, you really took a roundabout way to say something like that."`
`"No, that's wrong.`
` My soul was shut up in the seed of a homunculus,`
` and I was born out of a test tube."`
`"Huh?!`
` Ridiculous...!`
` That's goddamn impossible and you know it!"`
`"Kinzo accomplished even the miracle of creating life.`
` And only to shut my soul up in that cage.`
` ......That he would show such magical power simply because of his own love...`
` A thoroughly terrifying person."`
`"Aah, okay, it's really gotten to the point of ridiculousness now!`
` Say whatever you want.`
` I won't believe a word of it.`
` Just do what you like, for hell's sake."`
`"...............mh.`
` ...What is this unpleasant attitude?"`
`"Heh,`
` in the beginning, I showed a little interest, thinking there might be some huge hint hidden,`
` but the more I hear, the weirder this story starts to get.`
` This is supposed to be a game about denying witches,`
` but I get the feeling that I'm suddenly being made to just swallow a witch story."`
`"Sorry, but I don't feel like listening to this any more.`
` Just keep rambling on to yourself as much as you want.`
` I'll just be here digging out some earwax or something."`
`".....................`
` ......Hmph."`
`When I started showing a cold attitude, Beato acted unusually discouraged.`
`Of course, her expression was still brazen...`
`but I had the feeling that I was able to catch a glimpse of loneliness because I hadn't found the story of her past interesting,`
` in that really easy to understand expression of hers.`
`......For some reason, that slight reaction made her seem pitiful,`
` so even though I kept my couldn't‐care‐less attitude, I decided to humor her slightly.`
`Damn it, even though she's an irritating witch, I'm still weak against her because her chromosomes are XX...`
`"......Well, I have absolutely no desire to believe you, but,`
` ............keep going.`
` I'll listen to your story in place of cookies."`
`"So you treat the story of my past like cookies.`
` ......You think that if you abuse me like that, I will just casually tell you...?"`
`After I made fun of her, Beato reacted a little sensitively.`
`It looked like, even though making fun of people was her specialty, she was horrible at being made fun of by other people.`
`Just then, my cup of black tea suddenly made a sound, surprising me.`
`"......Milady's soul was seized and breathed into a cage of new life.`
` In other words, Milady received life as a human once more."`
`Before I had realized it, the demon butler had appeared and taken my cup, and was adding more black tea to it.`
`"Ronove.`
` That is enough of that story.`
` He says that it is too ridiculous to listen to.`
` I now also feel ridiculous and have no intention of speaking."`
`"Some new cookies are currently being baked.`
` I thought that, until then, the story of Milady's past would be a perfect substitute.`
` Pu ku ku...!"`
`"I, ...I already said that I've had enough of talking about me!`
` You are both unpleasant people.`
` I'm leaving!`
` Ronove, leave as soon as you are done serving.`
` No idle talking with Battler."`
`"Certainly.`
` I will make an effort."`
`Beato's confusing female short temper took hold of her, and she turned her body into gold butterflies, scattered, and disappeared.`
`After that, only Ronove and the scent of the black tea were left...`
`"......I feel kind of bad for making her angry."`
`"It appears that you are aware of it, so there is nothing more to be said."`
`"Wait a second.`
` Weren't you the one that pushed her over the edge?"`
`"Pu ku ku ku.`
` My, whatever could you mean?`
` Would you care for some sugar and milk?"`
`"...Just milk will be fine.`
` ............And I also want some cookies."`
`".........You are aware that baking the cookies will take some more time?"`
`"There's a substitute, you said?"`
`"......Certainly.`
` If you would listen quietly, I will continue the story."`
`"She said something about a homunculus.`
` ...I know a bit about that.`
` It's that thing, right?`
` A manufactured human created with alchemy or something?"`
`"Yes.`
` Milady's soul was shut up in a homunculus, and she was revived into this world, receiving life again as a baby.`
` ......However, because she was a baby,`
` even if Kinzo tried to profess his love to her, it would be useless."`
`"........................`
` .........You aren't saying...`
`......Grandfather shut that baby up in this hidden mansion,`
` until it grew to reach the same age?!"`
`"Yes.`
` That is what I am saying.`
` However, while her soul was the same, a human spirit receives a strong influence from its vessel.`
` Milady lost all of her memories of the past, and grew up as a very normal human girl."`
`"And you're saying......that's the Beato sitting in the garden chair?"`
`"Yes.`
` That is correct.`
` She grew to be completely identical.`
` However, she did not possess her power as a witch.`
` ......I must stress that Milady was a human."`
`"................................."`
`Beato, who was sitting in the garden chair, looking up at the sky, asked that same question again.`
`She asked who she was.`
`...The meaning of those words was finally starting to click.`
` She couldn't understand why she was living here, all locked up.`
`Grandfather had seized {f:5:Beatrice}'s soul, shut it up in a body of flesh,`
` and then shut that up in a hidden mansion.`
`However, since she had lived here since the time she was born, she couldn't even understand who she was,`
` or why she lived shut up in there...`
`......W‐...wait, wait.`
`{n}Who would take such a stupid story seriously?`
`Why don't I change my interpretation?`
`{n}...Essentially, couldn't it be something like this?`
`Grandfather met {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}He then fell in love with her and courted her, but she didn't nod her head in agreement.`
`{n}And so he got angry, and shut her up inside this hidden mansion.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} tried to escape, but no matter what she did, she couldn't succeed,`
` ......so she finally chose her own death.`
`......And then, .........hmm.`
`...Maybe there was a girl that looked just like {f:5:Beatrice}, ...no, a baby.`
`And Grandfather raised this child with care.`
`But maybe Grandfather didn't view this child as his daughter.`
`"Shut my soul up once more into a cage of flesh".`
`Those words probably meant...`
`...that he didn't view this kid as her child, but as her reincarnation.`
` Maybe that's what it meant.`
`If you interpret it that way, even a story that weird might make a little sense...`
`...No no no.`
` This might be some bullshit Beato cooked up to confuse me.`
`As if I could accept any of this...!`
`{n}In the first place, ...Kuwadorian, was it?`
`{n}There's no proof whatsoever that a hidden mansion actually existed.`
`Couldn't this be something she just fabricated on the spot?`
`"`
`{p:1:A hidden mansion called Kuwadorian does exist in the forest of Rokkenjima}.`
` That is the place we were just talking about."`
`".........Huh?`
` R‐...red?!"`
`Ronove used the red to say that Kuwadorian actually existed.`
`...Did that mean the same thing as the red Beato used?`
`"Even if I am not much of one, I am a demon all the same.`
` ...Please keep this a secret from Milady, yes?"`
`"...Y‐......yeah!"`
`Beato, who knew I would try to trip her up, had grown extremely cautious when using red.`
`To think that Ronove could also use that red...`
`Of course, it's the red of a crafty man.`
` I don't know how far I can accept it,`
` but anyway, I might be able to get some hint out of it......`
`"So that Beato relaxing in the garden of Kuwadorian, ...and that conversation she had with Grandfather, were the truth?"`
`"Yes.`
` It is the truth.`
` In the past,`
` {p:1:the pair actually had a conversation like that in this place}."`
`"Th‐thanks a lot.`
` I'll ask for some more red.`
` She said that she was born from a homunculus,`
` but does that kind of unscientific, magical thing actually exist?!"`
`"I am unable to answer that question.`
` The reason is that it would cause a stalemate."`
`"......A stalemate??`
` What do you mean?"`
`"It's a chess term referring to a state in which, similar to a "perpetual check",`
` any further progress in a game becomes impossible.`
` This is the opposite of an endless repetition of moves,`
` and refers to a situation in which all moves disappear, resulting in a kind of deadlock."`
`"In chess this would lead to a draw, just as if there were a perpetual check.`
` ...However, there is no draw in the game between you and Milady.`
` Therefore, I am unable to answer in red any question that would bring about a stalemate."`
`".........You're speaking in riddles by saying something I don't really understand,`
` but when it comes down to it, you're just trying to trick me because you can't say in red that something magical like a homunculus exists, right?"`
`"If I were to say in red that "witches exist", what would you do, Battler‐sama?"`
`"...............mh.`
` ......That's what we're having this big fight over whether or not to believe, right?`
` If you told me that outright, there'd be nothing more to discuss.`
` It'd be game over."`
`"If I said "witches exist" in red, you would have no room for argument.`
` However, since the reason would never have been made clear to you, Battler‐sama, you probably wouldn't accept it.`
` However, after being told that in red, you would have no room for argument and would not have been shown any proof."`
`"In this situation, Battler‐sama,`
` even though you wouldn't be able to admit defeat, you would have no way to make a counterargument, and it would become a deadlock.`
` Even though checkmate would not have been reached, no more moves would exist."`
`"Since you would not be able to make your next move, it would never become Milady's turn,`
` and the game would stop there for all eternity.`
` As a result, Milady would be unable to force you to submit.`
` ......That would be a deadlock situation."`
`"In order to avoid that,`
` I am unable to answer questions of this form in red."`
`"......So, to cut to the chase, you mean that questions that leave no room for discussion are prohibited?`
` Well, that makes sense, I guess.`
` If I was told "witches exist" in red, I'd have to give up from the start."`
`"I am pleased that you understand.`
` I believe we might be able to work together if you ask a question of a different form."`
`"......Can you respond to the repetition request she dodged?`
` About the number of people on this island."`
`"If Milady held back on the request, then of course I cannot respond.`
` As Milady's furniture, I am unable to act too forward."`
`Ronove made an exaggerated gesture, trying to act like a loyal retainer.`
` This guy's so shameless.`
`"Tch.`
` Just when I thought you might be useful."`
`"......I'll give up on that and search for a different question.`
` ...That's right.`
` I was forgetting to check something important.`
` .........This is a story about Beato's memories, right?`
` When did it happen?`
` It couldn't be happening right now, right?"`
`"Correct.`
` {p:1:This is the world of 1967}.`
` It is the world of 19 years ago."`
`"............Hmmmmm..."`
`Let's go through the story one more time.`
`{n}I wonder if it couldn't be something like this.`
`Grandfather had a person with whom he fell in unrequited love, called {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}And he confined her in this hidden mansion and continually courted her.`
`{n}But she was stubborn and didn't say yes.`
`Eventually, she grew pessimistic about being unable to escape from here...`
`and probably, committed suicide.`
`......And then,`
` ......her soul was put in a homunculus and......`
`No, no, if I accept that, it's the same as accepting the witch.`
`I can interpret that part like this.`
`{n}She probably......left a daughter behind when she died.`
`That talk about the soul being put in a new body...probably meant...`
`that Grandfather raised that child believing it to be the reincarnation of {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`...In that case, Beato must have existed on this island for at least the last 19 years as the 19th person, and then...`
`...umm......`
`"......I'm starting to get confused.`
` ...In any event, none of this leaves the realm of guesswork.`
` The only thing that I can definitely say in red,`
` is that in 1967, in a hidden mansion on Rokkenjima, {f:5:Beatrice} existed as a human.`
` That's all."`
`"That is correct.`
` {p:1:In 1967, in a hidden mansion on Rokkenjima, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama existed as a human}."`
`"Oh, thank you.`
` That really helps."`
`"Congratulations.`
` With this, you have made clear the existence of the piece known as the 19th person.`
` The 19th human outside of the 18 who you can blame, just as you longed for."`
`"......A sacrificial sheep that you can shift the blame of any crime onto.`
` And you must be so glad that it is Milady.`
` Pu ku ku ku."`
`Ronove laughed indiscreetly.`
`Somehow, I didn't like his phrasing, so I didn't feel like laughing along with him.`
`"......That's right.`
` Auntie Rosa said it.`
` ......‘{f:5:Beatrice} is dead’?`
` "I killed her"?`
` What does that mean...?"`
`"As for that, it may be faster to see the actual circumstances rather than listen to me tell you.`
` Let us advance the clock a little more."`
`Ronove pulled a stylish pocket watch from his pocket, and made to wind the crown.`
`As soon as he did, I saw gold butterflies gather behind Ronove's back and take the form of a person.`
`...Was it Beato?!`
` I quickly realized that it was someone else.`
`It was her.`
` That oldest sister of the Seven Stakes, who loved tormenting me more than anything else.`
`......If I don't think myself lucky to see that sexy ass, I won't be able to play along with their torture game...`
`"Ronove‐sama.`
` So, you were still here.`
` This is an urgent call from {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"My, my,`
` what kind of urgent business could it be?`
` ......It appears as though I have spent slightly too long chatting with you, Battler‐sama.`
` Well then, Battler‐sama, if you will excuse me.`
` Please continue to enjoy your game with Milady."`
`"Yeah, yeah.`
` I'll enjoy it as best as I can.`
` ...'Cause the conversations are more lively with you than with Beato.`
` And you use the red more graciously.`
` Come talk again any time."`
`"............Battler‐sama.`
` Despite how I look, I am Milady's furniture.`
` ...I cannot do something that Milady does not wish.`
` What I said in red was something that normally should have come from Milady's mouth.`
` ...I did nothing more than announce the red truth in Milady's place as she sulked."`
`"So she really was sulking then?`
` Ihihihi!"`
`"Pu ku kuku."`
`Seeing me and Ronove incomprehensibly hitting it off, that Seven Stakes chick cocked her head slightly.`
`"Ronove‐sama.`
` We are keeping {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama waiting.`
` Let us hurry."`
`"Yes, I will come immediately.`
` Well then, Battler‐sama, I shall see you later.`
` ......It appears that we have finally started getting along.`
` As I thought, I have the feeling that we can become good friends."`
`"If by that you mean partners at gossiping behind Beato's back."`
`"Ronove‐sama!"`
`"Yes, yes.`
` Then, if you will excuse me."`
`Maybe it was because she really didn't like seeing him act friendly with me, or maybe it was because she had really been told to hurry.`
`The Seven Stakes babe bellowed sharply at Ronove, and he laughed foolishly and disappeared, as if running away...`
`"......Hmph.`
` How could I, the eldest sister of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, be called on for this level of work!`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama could easily have told one of the younger sisters, who look like they have so much free time, for something like this. Sheesh...!"`
`"Why so grumpy, girl?`
` If you're hungry, eat a cookie or something.`
` Why don't I give you the last one?`
` Ihihi!"`
`"......Hummmmm?`
` How thoughtful.`
` Then, shall I take one?"`
`I lightly pushed the snack plate with the last remaining cookie on it over to her.`
`"Thank you"`
`As though coming as a replacement for the period at the end of the sentence, a sharp sound pierced the table...`
`The nails on three of her fingers had sharply extended, and were stuck...`
`a hair's breadth into the gaps between my fingers on the hand I had used to push the plate.`
`......It had happened in an instant, ...so for a while, I didn't even realize that her fingernails had grown.`
`The tips of those sharp nails were like blades with a red manicure.`
`......The spaces between the bases of my fingers prickled.`
`......Those razor‐like blades were sticking sharply into the back of my hand, and into the spaces between my fingers...`
`By those three blades, my carelessly outstretched right hand was not even permitted to shake, and all I could do now was allow a single line of cold sweat to drip down.`
`"............Wowee.`
` ...Isn't it about time you cut your nails, babe?"`
`"Lucifer.`
` ......That is my noble name.`
` Honored furniture serving {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, and the eldest sister of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory."`
`".........I'm not like my disgraceful and cretinous younger sisters.`
` If you don't show the proper respect, you will regret it."`
`"...How would I regret it?`
` I don't have a clue."`
`".........Heheheheheh.`
` Stupid kid.`
` ...Do you really want me to play with you that much?`
` You really can't get me out of your mind?"`
`"I'll thrust my stake deep, deep into you and make you really enjoy being gouged, got it......?`
` Hehehe{0}he{0}heh{0}heheh{0}he{0}hehehhh......!"`
`".........You bitch.`
` One day I'll push you down and say that back to you."`
`"Oh, really?`
` I'll be looking forward to that, then?`
` Ehhehe{0}heh{0}heheheh......`
` ...Ahhahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!!"`
`Rosa eventually regained her calm.`
`The men wanted to hurry her into talking faster, but Kyrie intervened.`
`...If something like she had just mentioned really had happened, ......it was an abominable past that she wouldn't want to remember.`
`After taking several deep breaths with her hand over her chest, it seemed that she had more or less gathered the resolve to talk...`
`"......How old was I then, I wonder...`
` ...Probably...middle school, or... ...I don't remember well.`
` Anyway, I think I was about that old..."`
`"Which means... Maybe about twenty years ago?"`
`"Back then, my grades weren't very good, and Mother was always angry at me.`
` ......I was trying to do my best in my own way,`
` but I couldn't respond to Mother's expectations at all..."`
`"......Mother was always very strict with Rosa.`
` I sympathized with her at the time."`
`"Hmm.`
` You say that even though you were always talking behind her back."`
`"Would you give it a rest, Eva.`
` So?`
` Where did you meet {f:5:Beatrice}, Rosa‐san?!"`
`"Hideyoshi‐san, you mustn't rush her now.`
` ......It's alright, Rosa‐san.`
` Tell us at your leisure."`
`".........Thank you.`
` ...It was a day when I had been scolded particularly harshly by Mother."`
`Even though my tutor had promised to keep it a secret,`
` ...apparently, they told Mother all about how I had complained.`
`Mother scolded me horribly, saying that I was a disgrace to the Ushiromiya family.`
`......Of course, I was doing the best I could.`
`But I had none of Krauss nii‐san's dignity,`
` I couldn't get excellent grades like Eva nee‐san,`
` and I had no leadership like Rudolf nii‐san.`
`...I never stood out, didn't particularly excel at anything,`
` and I almost wanted to ask myself why I had even been born into the Ushiromiya family.`
`I didn't know why I had been born.`
`{n}...On that day, I had the experience of my mind going blank for the first time......`
`For the first time since I was born,`
` ...I realized that in addition to facing or surrendering to my problems,`
` I had the third choice of running away.`
`Even though I say run away, there was no way I could have left Rokkenjima and gone somewhere else.`
`But, anyway, I wanted to run away from the mansion and the way I was at the time.`
`......In a way, it was like running away from home, or maybe a half‐hearted suicide...`
`"......I wanted to disappear.`
` Or maybe it was that child‐like form of resistance where I tried to make my parents worry by disappearing..."`
`".........I thought childishly that if I went into the center of the forest, I could escape from the Ushiromiya house,`
` or maybe I could get back at them by getting lost and making them worry."`
`"So then, ......you went into the forest that you'd been told not to go into?"`
`"......Yes.`
` After reaching the beach, I followed alongside the ocean.`
` ......I didn't have any particular reason,`
` ......but I felt that, if I went around to the opposite side of the island, there might be a place there that no one knew about,`
` which might become a hidden house just for me."`
`"Starting by the beach, it'd be impossible to go all the way around.`
` It becomes a cliff partway, right?`
` There's no way you could pass that way."`
`"...Of course.`
` So, I kept going wherever I could, and kept going deeper and deeper in.`
` ......It was a horrible forest without any paths, but that was comforting to me then.`
` ...If I could make it through such a dangerous forest, then it would be that much greater of an escape from the Ushiromiya family,`
` ...which made me feel good."`
`".........How shameful.`
` If you were scolded because of your grades, all you had to do was work harder."`
`"You mustn't say that.`
` Doesn't Rosa have her talent as a designer instead?"`
`Literally this could be taken as him covering for Rosa,`
` but everyone knew that Rosa's company was not making any profits.`
`"Quit it.`
` Now isn't the time for sarcasm.`
` ......And then you arrived there by coincidence...?`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice}'s...`
`hidden mansion."`
`Rosa nodded weakly......`
`"About how far did you walk.`
` Could you show it to us on a map...?`
` Natsuhi‐san, is there a map of this island?"`
`"No, not right here and now..."`
`"That would be impossible.`
` I was just walking randomly.`
` Even if you showed me a map, I wouldn't know.`
` ......And twenty years have passed since then.`
` I probably couldn't reach it again even if I went into the forest..."`
`".........Hmmmmmm..."`
`Several people let out dejected sighs.`
`It was vividly clear that in their haste,`
` they had thought that some hint related to the witch's epitaph, or maybe even the gold itself, might be resting there in that hidden mansion.`
`"The only part of Rokkenjima that got made ready for development is the area around the mansion.`
` ...The rest is completely uncultivated, and it would probably take considerable effort to survey the entire island."`
`"But just knowing that it actually exists is helpful.`
` It would take some money, but if we enlisted an aerial photography company to investigate,`
` or asked the contractors who constructed this mansion about what happened at the time,`
` we could probably find some way to search for it."`
`"Yes.`
` ...There should be more ways to do it now that there isn't a question about whether it exists or not."`
`"......Mmhm.`
` It is probably worth investigating right away."`
`"We will do that investigation together as siblings.`
` We won't let you do it alone, Nii‐san."`
`It wasn't certain that the gold was hidden in that secret mansion,`
` but it seemed that the fireworks between Krauss and Eva had already begun.`
`"Give it a rest for now, you two.`
` ...Rosa, please continue."`
`"..................Yes."`
`Blindly, randomly, I kept running, on and on.`
`Suddenly, it felt like I had come across something like an animal trail.`
`I had no idea how far I'd walked, and I was very tired,`
` so by then, I was just naturally taking the easiest path to walk on.`
`As I did, .........suddenly, right before my eyes, a very, very tall fence appeared.`
`It was a fence wonderfully adorned in a gothic style.`
`For an instant, I spun around, thinking that I might have returned to the original mansion.`
`Of course, there were fences around the mansion to stop us from entering the forest.`
` But this fence was decorated differently, ......and most of all, it was very tall.`
`It probably reached a full two stories up.`
`It was covered with ivy, and created a mysterious, solemn atmosphere...`
`At the time, ......I believed the legend of the witch of the forest, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`I had been told that she was frightening,`
` but some of the servants told me that she would sometimes help you if you respected her.`
`......Since I had started to lose confidence in how my life was going,`
` I believed that the only way I could be saved was by receiving her help.`
`So that's what made me think it.`
` ......I believed that this was the fence of the mansion of {f:5:Beatrice}, the witch of the forest.`
`I thought that if I could meet with {f:5:Beatrice}, she would definitely save me.`
`So I thought I would try to go in.`
`But that fence was very, very tall, and it didn't look like I could go over it.`
`So I decided to walk around it.`
`{n}I thought that if I did, I would eventually reach a gate.`
`But it wasn't that easy.`
` The fence had a length to match its height, and no matter how far I went, I didn't reach a corner.`
`It might have been enclosing a very massive area,`
` ...or maybe it just felt that way because my child's legs made it difficult to walk in the forest.`
`Anyway, because I couldn't find a gate for a while,`
` I started to feel sad, as though the witch had rejected me...`
`As I did, I eventually came upon a large tree, whose twisted root had bent the fence.`
`I might get my clothes dirty, but if I crawled, it looked like I would be able to sneak in...`
`".........And that was the hidden mansion?"`
`"I don't know whether it was the hidden mansion we've been talking about...`
` Still, at the very least, it wasn't a place that we know of."`
`It wasn't as though I came out into a garden as soon as I passed the fence.`
`{n}I had to continue through a lot more uncultivated forest after that.`
`And then......the forest suddenly opened up.`
` And what appeared there was an unbelievably...`
`.........fantastical scene.`
`To think that Rokkenjima, where I had believed no one other than us lived,`
` ...had been hiding such a wonderful mansion...`
`A beautiful flower garden spanned the front of the mansion.`
`{n}It was a flower garden of a completely different design from the rose garden we know so well, and was very lovely.`
`Of course, the mansion was also wonderful.`
`...It was one or two sizes smaller than ours,`
` but it was a very elegant, and yet lovely mansion.`
`Then, ...............I saw her.`
`{n}I saw her sitting in a garden chair, positioned to give a view of the flower garden, wearing an elegant dress.`
`It was that black dress embroidered in gold that we would later know from that portrait.`
`......I hadn't seen an elegant dress like that except in fairy tales and on the stage of musicals.`
`...That a person would be wearing it as their normal clothes... That in itself seemed quite fantastical.`
`That magical scene was enough to make me lose my sense of reality.`
`If someone had told me then that it was a dream,`
` I might have nodded obediently, and waited to wake up in my bed...`
`Since, in my shock, I had forgotten to hide myself, she eventually noticed me.`
`At first, her expression was quite listless,`
` but when she noticed me, her eyes opened very wide.`
`...It was only natural—a guest that she didn't know had suddenly appeared.`
`I automatically bowed my head, feeling that I should greet her and apologize for entering without permission...`
`"............Who are you?`
` A new gardener?"`
`Those were the first words she said to me.`
`{n}...That calmed me down a little bit.`
`{n}Because I realized that she could be talked with.`
`Because I hadn't been turned into a frog just by meeting her eyes, like the terrifying witch in that fairy tale.`
`"......I,`
` ......I'm sorry.`
` ...I shouldn't have entered the garden without permission..."`
`"........................`
` ......Who are you?`
` Name yourself."`
`"I, ...I am Ushiromiya Rosa."`
`"......Ushiromiya.`
` .....................Hoh.`
` ...So you are one of Kinzo's family."`
`"Huh?`
` Ah, ...yes!`
` I'm Kinzo's daughter.`
` G‐good afternoon...!"`
`I was just a little surprised.`
`{n}...After all, Father was a great man feared by everyone.`
`And she had referred to him without using honorifics.`
`{n}So she quickly became frightening.`
`...After all,`
` if she could refer to my fearsome father that way, she must be a witch with incredible power.`
`After staring at me curiously, she beckoned me to come over to her.`
`And I obeyed, although filled with belated trepidation.`
`{n}......After all, I thought I really might be turned into a frog.`
`...And the closer and closer I got, the stronger that fear became.`
`After all, ...I said it several times already, but,`
` ............that woman and her dress and the flower garden and the mansion,`
` ......that entire harmony was so fantastical and beautiful that it seemed separate from reality.`
`It surely wouldn't have surprised me even if she was actually a witch...`
`And I was truly lucky.`
`{n}She didn't turn me into a frog.`
`As I awkwardly stood there stock still, she motioned to an open chair, and urged me to sit down.`
`"Sit.`
` Welcoming and speaking to those who visit this garden for the first time is my only pleasure.`
` .........That said, I have nothing else to find pleasure in."`
`As she said that, she showed an unhappy smile for just an instant.`
`Because I was full of a strange mix of tension and excitement, I rudely asked her a question suddenly.`
`"...Umm,`
` ............are you the witch of the forest,`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice}......?"`
`"Indeed.`
` I am {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"As I thought.`
` {f:5:Beatrice} actually existed..."`
`"...Did she look just like the portrait?"`
`"......Yes.`
` Exactly like the portrait."`
`"So she wasn't just...`
`...a witch from Father's imagination..."`
`"And then, what did you talk with her about?"`
`"...As she prepared some tea, she asked me various things about myself.`
` ......First, she was surprised that I had come through the forest.`
` It seems she believed that many dangerous wolves lived outside the fence."`
`"...So when I told her I had reached this place by going through the forest, she was very surprised.`
` She asked how I had managed to escape from the wolves—did I give them biscuits and they let me go?`
` Or did I cover myself in a magic cloak, or...`
` Those kinds of things, I think."`
`"Wahahaha.`
` ...That sure sounds like a witch.`
` What an interestin' person."`
`"Quiet, honey.`
` ............It was a long time ago,`
` but didn't Father threaten us, saying that wolves lived in the forest, so we shouldn't get close to there?"`
`"Yes, there was a time like that.`
` Ridiculous.`
` Even though Japanese wolves went extinct long ago.`
` What a childish trick."`
`"I don't remember, though...?`
` Did Dad really tell us something like that...?`
` It was the witch of the forest, right?`
` I don't think I've ever heard about wolves."`
`"You were still in elementary school.`
` Don't you remember?"`
`"You actually went and replied that you'd want to try petting the wolves.`
` So Father immediately gave up the wolf story and changed it to the story about the witch.`
` Such obvious lies, ahahahahaha."`
`"Hahahaha.`
` At the time, the witch story had a much more immediate effect on you, Rudolf, than the wolves.`
` I remember it well.`
` Don't you remember those nights when you clung to my back?"`
`"...*giggle*.`
` I see, even Rudolf‐san used to have that cute period."`
`"Oh, put a lid on it.`
` I was just a kid."`
`"......Well, anyway.`
` If Father was the one who shut {f:5:Beatrice} up in there, it makes sense that he would use the same wolf story.`
` To him, the vast forest of Rokkenjima was a wall that shouldn't be crossed,`
` dividing his two incompatible worlds: the Ushiromiya family and his mistress's mansion."`
`"If you think about the height of that fence, it does seem that Father had turned the whole area, garden and all, into a giant jail cell.`
` ......Just like a national border dividing his two separate worlds."`
`"...Forget the wolves, were there any kinds of stray dogs there at the time?`
` It could have been a fence to protect against those."`
`"There are no wolves or stray dogs on Rokkenjima.`
` Just as Nii‐san and Kyrie‐san are saying,`
` that fence was probably a border between us and {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"However, if she innocently believed the story about the wolves, that's pretty...naive.`
` That's nothin' like the way I'd imagine a witch."`
`"......That's right.`
` I also sensed that.`
` ...She was very pompous, just like my image of a witch,`
` ...but she was somehow very childish, and...`
`...how should I say it, too honest?`
` ......She gave me the impression that she didn't know anything about the world."`
`"If I had to describe it, ...it was almost as though she had come from a fairy‐tale land.`
` ......She was a truly mysterious person."`
`"......What happened after that?`
` ...Did you end up talking about Dad at all?"`
`"Yes.`
` Once every few days, sometimes on an arranged day and sometimes suddenly,`
` Father would appear casually, and they would drink tea together, or take a walk together or something, she said.`
` And that, by coincidence, she was by herself on the day I visited."`
`"I see.`
` Truly a mistress, then.`
` ...My, my.`
` I don't know how much younger she was, but... not bad, Father."`
`"......I remain firmly convinced that it was not an indecent relationship."`
`"Gosh, you are an idiot. There's no way a lover's meeting between a man and a woman wouldn't have {i:some} sensuality.`
` What happened next?`
` What did you talk about after that?"`
`".........Because I had introduced myself, I then asked her about herself."`
`"...When I did, the atmosphere quickly grew depressing.`
` ......How should I say it, she seemed very listless and lonely.`
` ...It was the same expression as the one I had first seen on her face."`
`"Well, that's because she was his hidden mistress.`
` If she just walked around wherever she liked, she might have been discovered by Mother.`
` ......I'm sure the situation was almost like house arrest."`
`"Even though she had beautiful clothes, a beautiful mansion, and a garden, she must have felt very constrained.`
` No surprise she felt it hard.`
` .........And then?"`
`"There was definitely something on her mind.`
` ......I remember getting the impression that it wasn't something that I could resolve just by talking to her,`
` and feeling very sad about it as well."`
`".........She seemed to have forgotten that I was even there.`
` ...She was gazing vaguely off into the distance, and was silent for a long, long time."`
`"...I thought that I must have said something wrong,`
` ......but it didn't seem to be the type of atmosphere where I could offer words of apology...`
` ......So, I too remained silent for a long, long time, until she remembered that I was there..."`
`When she did, ......she muttered unexpectedly.`
`".........Are there really no wolves beyond the fence?"`
`"...Hmm?`
` Y‐yes.`
` I've never seen wolves even in a zoo."`
`"What is this "zoo"?"`
`"Ah, ...it's a place where they keep all kinds of animals.`
` They're full of rare animals like elephants and giraffes and pandas."`
`"..............................`
` ...Are there no wolves in a zoo?`
` Then, umm, ...that might not be scary."`
`"Even if there were wolves, all of the animals are put in cages, so it's safe.`
` So you can feel safe as you look at and learn about them."`
`The witch of the forest, of all people, was for some reason scared of and didn't like wolves.`
`I remember it looked pretty comical.`
`"..................`
` ...How does that differ from myself?"`
`"............Huh?"`
`She didn't even know about zoos.`
`I explained how fun zoos could be,`
` but it was very difficult to get a person like her, who had never been to one, to understand...`
`Quite the opposite, as I explained it to her, her expression grew increasingly dismal.`
`...She couldn't see the difference.`
`It seemed that, although this mansion surrounded by a high fence appeared at a glance to afford her a completely provided‐for life of comfort,`
` she couldn't see how she was different from the animals shut up in cages...`
`"Who am I?`
` ......Everyone calls me {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...And that does certainly seem to be the name of a great witch, as you say."`
`"......But that is not me.`
` I cannot use any magic.`
` ......I simply have the soul of that witch sealed inside my body."`
`"..................?"`
`There was definitely something mysterious about her.`
` It wasn't just that she was somehow at odds with the world,`
` but it seemed that she truly believed that a thing called magic actually exists.`
`I think she talked about various weird things, but I don't remember the details.`
`All I thought was:`
` ......this might be a pitiful person.`
`She was unable to leave this mansion of her own will, a prisoner without even realizing it.`
`......And she didn't know anything about the outside world, didn't even understand who she was.`
`......She probably vaguely understood herself that she was pitiful.`
`But since she didn't know anything, it seemed that she couldn't realize that this was unhappiness.`
`Nee‐san, long ago, when I told you that I felt sorry for a bird in a cage, I remember you said this to me.`
`"A bird that only knows the inside of a cage doesn't long for the outside".`
`But she wasn't a bird.`
`{n}She was, ultimately, a human.`
`Even if she had never been outside the cage, she understood that it wasn't the whole world.`
`So,`
` .........I invited her.`
`"Do you want to try...`
`...going outside the fence?"`
`".........Th‐there really aren't any wolves?"`
`"There aren't.`
` You'll definitely be safe."`
`"..............................`
` ......I want to leave.`
` But the gate is always closed."`
`"There's the place I came in through.`
` There's a crack you can slip through."`
`"......If we go through there, is there a world outside?"`
`"Yes."`
`"........................There really aren't any wolves?"`
`"*giggle*.`
` No, none at all."`
`".............................."`
`I had only planned to invite her for a short walk,`
` ...but she kept looking over her shoulder at the mansion, as though she were seriously deliberating over something.`
`Then I learned what she was preparing herself for.`
`"...............I...have had enough of this place.`
` ......I want to go...outside.`
` And I want to know...who I am, what's happening in this world,`
` ...and the purpose for which I was born."`
`I didn't know what her life had been like until then.`
`It was probably something that she couldn't express easily.`
`If it was harsh, she just had to say that she wanted to escape.`
`{n}If it was sweet, she just had to say that she would stay.`
`To liken it to something,`
` perhaps it was similar to how a hot fireplace on a winter day makes the air get thicker and thicker, giving you a headache...?`
`Even though you know that you shouldn't keep things the way they are, you still need the courage to open the window and be tormented by the cold wind...`
`She was starting to realize that she couldn't stay there forever.`
`She was starting to realize that she had to go outside sometime.`
`But, since she didn't know about the outside world,`
` to take that first step outside must have required an unimaginable amount of courage...`
`And she had taken that into consideration, and resolved herself.`
`She had put that resolution to go outside into words, for what was surely the first time in her entire life.`
`...I hesitated slightly.`
`{n}It had been decided that she would live here by Father.`
`{n}It was as if she were Father's beloved bird in a cage.`
`If I just let her escape,`
` ......wouldn't I be harshly scolded by Father...?`
`"I want to see."`
`".........Hm?`
` See what?"`
`"I want to see...a zoo."`
`".....................ah."`
`I was just a little surprised when she finally showed me a very soft smile.`
`That might have been...`
`an inner peace, coming from her newfound readiness to venture out from her cage.`
`A soft smile which I wouldn't have imagined could have come out of that dark face...`
`"......When I speak with you, I keep hearing about things I don't know.`
` ...I don't know about this thing called school, nor about zoos.`
` I don't know about movie theaters.`
` I don't know about amusement parks."`
`".........And I think, from the bottom of my heart, that I want to know about them.`
` ...Will you take me there?"`
`"Huh? ......Y‐yes."`
`...I was nervous about how I would do it and keep it a secret from Father,`
` ...but her face looked so happy, so I went along with her and nodded.`
`But it seemed that the meaning behind my vague expression was not communicated to her.`
`It seemed that she believed that I would really take her to all of those places if we left.`
`She was pure and genuine.`
` ......She had probably never been tricked by anyone.`
` No, ......maybe it should be said that she hadn't been taught how to doubt.`
`Her face was somewhat radiant, and yet pathetic.`
`{n}...I wanted to somehow grant her modest wish.`
`"I...have had enough of {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I want to know who I am.`
` I want to start out as a new human, not {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"So, I want you to take me from here.`
` .........I don't need tea anymore.`
` I don't need this dress.`
` I won't meet with Kinzo again.`
` ......Please, take me from here.`
` Rosa."`
`However, that responsibility was one that a child such as me couldn't possibly bear fully.`
`But her serious gaze and her brilliant smile,`
` ...almost as though an evil spirit had lifted from her,`
` ......made me feel a little courage start to rise up inside myself.`
`This was definitely something that would get me in a lot of trouble.`
`{n}......But it was definitely the right thing to do.`
`I don't know how it will turn out, but......`
` ......I'll take her out.`
`Of course, I won't be able to ask help from Father, and not Mother either.`
`.........Should I talk to Onii‐sama or Onee‐sama?`
`{n}No, what about that reliable Genji‐san, or...`
`that's right, what about Kumasawa‐san, to whom I can always talk when I'm in trouble.`
`I'm sure they'll be able to do something.`
`Anyway, for now, I'll take her out of here.`
`{n}Because this is no longer a place where she wishes to be.`
`......And so, I took her to the crack in the fence and led her outside.`
`She was all nervous, checking to make sure there were no wolves around,`
` but after that fear disappeared,`
` she seemed somehow to be having fun even just walking around this dense forest.`
`Every time she found something, she would ask me about it.`
`{n}And they were all really minor things.`
`......What's that flower?`
` What's that leaf?`
` And that sound?`
` And that smell?`
`It was really like...the inside of that fence had been her entire world.`
`So, to her, who had stepped {i:out} of the world, this was.........`
`......You know, it's strange.`
`In the beginning, when I first saw her, I thought that she was the absolute incarnation of a witch relaxing by a witch's mansion.`
`But now it was different.`
` Or actually, the complete opposite.`
`......She had gone out of a world she had believed to be finite, and was full of joy at realizing for the first time that the world was endless.`
`So everything she saw was new.`
`{n}......It was almost as though she was the one who had been thrown into a fairy tale.`
`If she was Alice, then I felt almost like a rabbit holding a watch......`
`To her, it was probably a really fun walk, filled to the brim with excitement.`
` ...But as for me, the truth was, I was completely bewildered.`
`......After all, I had walked randomly to get there.`
`{n}So there was no way I could have known the way back to the mansion.`
`There were no lights in the forest, and I hadn't brought a flashlight.`
`{n}I realized that it would be terrible if it got dark while we were still like this, and grew impatient.`
`She was too innocent,`
` and apparently, she couldn't understand at all how frightening it would be to face the night inside the forest.`
`But I was the one who had brought her outside.`
`{n}...Somehow, I had to take responsibility, and resolve this situation.`
`So I thought.`
` ......That for now we should just go out to the sea.`
`{n}If we then followed the coast around, eventually we should definitely be able to make it back to the mansion.`
`However, that was much more of a problem than I had imagined.`
`{n}...After all, I didn't have a map or a compass.`
`There was no way I could walk in a straight line through an uncultivated forest, and I had immediately lost my sense of direction.`
`I already had no clue which trail I had come by, and was completely lost...`
`At this rate, night would definitely fall before I even knew where I was walking.`
`But I didn't have the luxury to complain.`
`Because that woman following behind me was so innocent and having so much fun.`
` ...Therefore, for the sake of her smile if nothing else,`
` I absolutely had to guide her out of this forest.`
`Gritting my teeth so that I didn't show her a troubled face,`
` I pushed my way onward through the pathless woods.`
`And, although we had various troubles, we were lucky enough to make it to the sea...`
`At that time, I still didn't even have a clue where I was on the island,`
` but for the time being, I was just a little reassured, realizing that if I just went around this way, I would surely be able to return to the mansion.`
`Of course, although I said that we reached the sea, we were on the top of a rocky cliff.`
` The beach was far below us.`
`I was tired from walking around the forest for so long,`
` so I thought that even though it was a rocky beach, an open area would probably be much easier to walk in.`
`So I planned to somehow go down the rocky cliff.`
`{n}...It did look pretty dangerous, and I wondered if there was some other way.`
`However, {f:5:Beatrice} agreed with my plan without any doubts.`
`......Even though she was probably older than me,`
` ...she obeyed me truly obediently, almost as though she were some kind of chick who believed I was a mother bird.`
`I searched to see if there wasn't some place where I could go down the cliff.`
` ...Then I found a place where the cliff had crumbled into a slope.`
`.......It looked a little dangerous,`
` but if I went down on both hands and both legs, like I was crawling, I thought it would probably be okay.`
`"......Let's go down here.`
` It'll be dangerous if you aren't careful,`
` but for now, if we go down to the beach and walk along it, I think we can avoid getting lost any more."`
`"Mmhm.`
` If you will do that, then let's go.`
` I find this getting lost to be fun also.`
` I'm very happy."`
`.........She really had no sense of danger.`
`{n}There was probably no mistake that she had lived a life without discomfort.`
`Even though she knew it would get dark when night fell,`
` she couldn't imagine how dangerous the inside of a forest could be without a light.`
`Furthermore, it seemed that she couldn't grasp at all how dangerous it might be if she fell from the cliff.`
`I warned her once more to be careful.`
`I cautiously examined the place where we could go down.`
`{n}...It looked......pretty high up.`
`{n}I think it might have been about ten meters down.`
`If you looked at it from the bottom up, it would probably have looked shorter than the roof of the mansion.`
` But looking from the top, it felt almost like staring down from the Tokyo Tower's observation room.`
`But {f:5:Beatrice} still appeared to be completely without fear.`
` ...It felt as though she had never even been taught that high places were dangerous.`
`......No, maybe she truly believed that she was a witch,`
` and that she could fly, so there wasn't anything dangerous.`
`"Please be careful.`
` ...It's pretty...high."`
`"Mmhm.`
` I will be careful.`
` I see there's a beach if we go down there.`
` Is there an aquarium there?"`
`"No, there are no aquariums on this island.`
` But I think there are lots of fish in the sea."`
`"I see.`
` So there are fish.`
` Are there, ...umm, whales and dolphins and penguins, like you talked about?"`
`"No, you would have to go to an aquarium for those.`
` ......And there aren't any aquariums unless you leave this island."`
`"Is that so?`
` ......But I look forward to it.`
` What kind of fish are whales?"`
`"Umm, ...they're really big fish and...huh, aren't they mammals?`
` And they spit out seawater."`
`"Hoh.`
` Then the dolphins?"`
`"Umm, they're really smart fish and...{0}huh...{0}aren't they also mammals?`
` They're really smart and they can be taught tricks and stuff."`
`"Hohhoh.`
` Then what about penguins?"`
`"Umm, ...huh, weren't they birds...?"`
`"What's this?`
` Didn't you say that there were fish in aquariums?"`
`"Ummm, ummm...`
` Well, um, there isn't only fish, they're full of all kinds of things that live in the ocean."`
`"Hohhoh.`
` I am really looking forward to that!`
` .........nn—"`
`{a:c:`
`Wa, hyaa.}`
`She made...some might have described it as a funny,`
` ...rushed and short voice,`
` ...no, probably it was a scream, I think.`
`She suddenly made a sound like that.`
`......Her body separated from the cliff, and gently fell down.`
`I immediately thought to say to her.`
`{n}"How many times did I warn you to be careful!"`
`......It was the thought of a child.`
` It was how a child immediately gets mad when something happens, trying to show that they are not at fault.`
`Of course, I said it too.`
`{n}Are you alright?`
` How many times did I warn you......`
`"...............So,`
` ...after she fell from the cliff,`
` ...what happened?"`
`"..........................."`
`"......What happened to her?`
` ...Rosa."`
`Rosa fell silent.`
` ...Her gaze fell to her feet, ...as though she were seeing through the floor to some disgusting memory...`
`"She...died, right......?"`
`Eva's brutal words were the ones that Rosa had most wanted to avoid.`
`And when she was hit with them, ......she screamed in resignation.`
`"Yes, she died!!`
` It was a rocky beach, many sharp and dangerous rocks lay exposed!!`
` Her eyes were still open, the blood kept pouring out... Suddenly a red carpet was spreading out...!"`
`"I spoke to her, shook her!!`
` But she refused to respond, not even a blink, ......no, she wouldn't even close her eyelids!!"`
`"It was my fault!`
` She was wearing a dress, remember?!`
` Even though I knew that her outfit was difficult to move in, I said that we should go down the cliff!!`
` She was incredibly innocent, so she obeyed what I said without any doubts...!!"`
`"......How long do you plan on remaining dead?`
` Open your eyes already.`
` Honestly, just turning into a lump of meat without me."`
`"I was just flirting with your friend the sexy‐assed chick.`
` ......More importantly, what is all this?"`
`"Mmm.`
` It is as you see.`
` ......I missed my footing, fell down,`
` {i:and died}."`
`"What did you say...`
` .........Even though you appeared as the 19th person,`
` ......you say you died......?"`
`"Don't mess with me, that can't be...!`
` Auntie Rosa was a kid, and she was panicking.`
` It's not like there was a doctor.`
` She probably made a mistake, thinking you were dead, and you probably, umm, ......were in a state of apparent death, or something, but actually alive.`
` Right?!"`
`It can't be.`
` She's obviously alive.`
`{n}Otherwise, she wouldn't be here in front of me, right...?!`
`...The kid‐aged Auntie Rosa was shaking {f:5:Beatrice}'s body, crying.`
`I too stared into that face,`
` ...............but her eyes were still open, and it really was a corpse.`
`...I wanted to brush it off with something vague like a state of apparent death,`
` ......but from any angle, there was nothing "apparent" about it; ...she really didn't look anything but dead...`
`{f:5:Beatrice} had fallen upside‐down from a cliff of that height,`
` ......and her head had smashed against the pointed tip of those sharp rocks.`
`............You would die, wouldn't you,`
` ......from that height,`
` ......on those rocks......`
`But I can't accept that...`
`No matter how dead she looks, ......she has to be alive...!`
` And she became this damn irritating witch!`
` That way, all of the inconsistencies fit.`
`She'd been confined by Grandfather in a hidden mansion the whole time.`
`And then to avenge herself, she planned out her revenge,`
` ......and would go on to commit a number of atrocious murders!`
`Auntie Rosa probably just mistakenly thought that she was dead.`
` But she was really alive, and as soon as Auntie Rosa left, she miraculously started breathing again.`
`......And then she somehow lived until today, and would open the curtain on the scene of her revenge.`
`Otherwise, the facts don't fit together!!`
`"......I won't let you trick me so easily.`
` Can you repeat it in red?!`
` That she died for certain!!`
` She has to be alive, right?!`
` It's obvious!!"`
`"How does {i:that} look like {i:being alive} to you?`
` {p:1:She's definitely dead}!"`
`".................................mgghhhh..."`
`My theory that the 19th person was Grandfather's mistress, who was a human {f:5:Beatrice}, broke down.`
`...I thought I had managed to segue from a defensive position into a counterattack, but......`
`"......Then, ......who are you?`
` You just died, this very minute!`
` You aren't going to say that you revived yourself with magic, are you?!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` I think that I've already explained it, though."`
`"......The me that is lying over there definitely has my soul,`
` but that body was nothing more than a cage of flesh tying me to the physical world.`
` And that cage of flesh was thus broken.`
` ......Do you understand what that means?"`
`"...............I don't have a clue anymore.`
` ......Keep having fun with your witch‐girl talk.`
` I'll listen instead of eating a cookie!`
` What the... It's empty.`
` Hey, could I get some more black tea?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Ronove.`
` Our guest wants some black tea."`
`When Beato clapped her hands, Ronove appeared.`
`......Butlers sure are convenient.`
`"A refill, is it?`
` Certainly.`
` How much shall I pour you?"`
`"Well, I've got more than enough to go with it.`
` Half will be fine."`
`"Filling it to the brim regardless is the English custom."`
`Even though just enough to wet my throat would have been fine, he filled it to the top with tea.`
`I turned my back to Beato, sipping it in silence...`
`"Wait... Open your eyes...!!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}...!!"`
`Rosa shook me,`
` ............no, shook the corpse that had once been me.`
`I watched over her from a short distance away.`
`Ah, ...so I fell from there and died.........`
`I believed that was true for a while.`
` ...After that, I saw Rosa spend a long time beside my corpse, then watched her as she ran away.`
`......Eventually, I realized that I was a different individual from that corpse...`
`".....................That's right.`
` I am......me.`
` ...So, I have finally been able to escape from Kinzo's restrictions..."`
`Eventually, I felt the memory returning...`
`{n}The fact that I was an Endless Witch who had lived for one thousand years.`
`And then I remembered that I had been summoned by Kinzo, and for a long time, had been imprisoned by him...`
`While I had been imprisoned in a cage of flesh, I had completely lost my memory as a witch.`
`However, thanks to Rosa, if you could say that...`
`Thanks to my accidental but fortunate death, I had now finally brought myself together......`
`"......Rosa.`
` You are probably regretting that you brought about my death.`
` But as for me, I could even thank you.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`Rosa was already nowhere to be seen.`
` Had she gone to call a doctor, or had she escaped from a scene which had become frightening?`
`...That no longer matters.`
`{n}That soulless shell is no longer worth anything.`
`All that aside, ......how frail I am now.`
`{n}Even this glorious midday sun is agony to me now.`
`I destroyed my human form.`
`{n}Then I changed it to several gold butterflies.`
`......Yes, with my magic power as frail as it is now, this form is easier.`
`And to escape even a little from the light of the sun, I rode the wind and lightly passed over the cliff.`
`It will probably be somewhat cooler in the forest.`
`Anyway, I'll take some time to recuperate, and regain my original power.`
`......As I think of how I will pay Kinzo back for all he has done.`
`Dancing alone through the air, I looked down at the shore one more time.`
`On the rocky shore lay the figure I had once possessed, ......and that I would eventually regain.`
`To regain the form of that physical body I have thrown away,`
` ...it will probably take more than one hundred, two hundred days.`
`...It might require one thousand days, or maybe even more.`
`However, I am the Endless Witch.`
`{n}The Golden Witch who has lived for one thousand years.`
`{n}Waiting any countable number of days is no problem at all.`
`*cackle*cackle*. Oh, Kinzo.`
`{n}You may regret that you are not here now.`
`{n}No longer will you be able to capture me.`
`{n}...*cackle*cackle*!`
`".........And then, you changed into gold butterflies, hid in the forest, and waited for your magic power to be restored? Is that what you're saying?"`
`"That is correct.`
` I take this form to sneer at you, but normally, it is easier magically for me to keep my form as gold butterflies."`
`"Don't stress yourself and stay in an easy form.`
` I wouldn't mind not hearing your irritating laugh."`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` When I turned into butterflies and slipped into the forest, it was already no longer possible for Kinzo to find me.`
` ......However, Kinzo was not about to stand there doing nothing.`
` Still, he would be unable to immediately prepare a way to catch me."`
`"Therefore, he first moved immediately to prevent me from leaving this island,`
` and to keep me from regaining my power."`
`".........My, my. All I can say is that Kinzo's tenacity does defy the imagination.`
` ...It is pretty tough to be loved by someone like that.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"A way to keep you from leaving after you became butterflies?`
` What, did he put a bug net around the entire forest?"`
`"Indeed.`
` He did the magical equivalent.`
` .........Did you know?`
` On the sea in front of the harbor floats a reef, on which sits a small shrine of Eastern magic."`
`"......Ah, that.`
` It was gone this year, though.`
` It was a small shrine built long ago by a mountaineering ascetic, right?"`
`"This island was originally an island of distortions.`
` Magical beings and other beings of similar ilk were attracted to it.`
` ......Milady herself is one of them, I imagine.`
` How about some more tea?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*, please.`
` ......They did harm to humans, and probably left several eerie legends behind them."`
`"That small shrine was built in ancient times by an Eastern mage who heard of them.`
` A long time passed, and that power was lost.`
` By repairing it, Kinzo restored this island's barrier, and once again tied me to this island."`
`"......Can Eastern magic work on a Western witch like you?"`
`"Normally the affinity is poor.`
` However, for the purpose of sealing me there, in a way, it might have been suitable."`
`"If it was Western magic, I would have some knowledge.`
` For any barrier, there would have been some measures I could have taken.`
` But Eastern magic is outside my area of expertise.`
` It was as if I had been given chopsticks instead of a spoon for some soup I was trying to eat."`
`"In a space strongly controlled by Eastern magic, Western magic loses much of its power.`
` It would likely have taken her a thousand days to regain her power even under normal circumstances,`
` and now it would take her much, much longer."`
`"......So you're trying to say that it took you twenty years to regain your power, and now you are revived, like this?"`
`"Those were horribly long years...`
` I spent many days in the form of gold butterflies, found Kinzo's mansion, and watched over him every day.`
` I lived through those days with no means to enjoy myself except to ponder how I would get back at him."`
`"......What was fortunate for me was that during those twenty years,`
` Kinzo tried to use every magic to find and capture me, and failed in them all."`
`"A human cannot bring about miracles very many times.`
` Even simply holding me captive for that long had been a miracle far above his place.`
` It would be unthinkable for me to be captured like that multiple times."`
`".........Grandfather said something in the previous game.`
` It was something like, magic dwells in probabilistic miracles."`
`"Mmhm.`
` While Kinzo searched for a hidden art to capture me again, he ended up at that.`
` ...............Then, he finally worked out the ritual involving the offering of thirteeen sacrifices to revive me again."`
`"Thirteen......sacrifices..."`
`"That is the witch's epitaph.`
` It is a poem of sacrifices.`
` ......Six people on the first twilight.`
` Two people on the second twilight.`
` And then five more people on the fourth through eighth twilights.`
` A forbidden ritual, involving the offering of a total of thirteen people as sacrifices...`
` Those sacrifices are chosen randomly, and the one holding the ritual, Kinzo himself, is not an exception."`
`"You're out of your mind...`
` Are you saying that all of the gruesome murders that occurred on this island were all part of a weird ritual?!!"`
`I was vaguely thinking that this might be a possibility...`
`But I can't just hear that this is the truth from a witch and a demon and say "Oh, really?" and accept it!`
`"There are eighteen people on Rokkenjima.`
` Thirteen are sacrificed; only five are left alive.`
` Then I revive."`
`"......In other words, the odds that Kinzo will be able to meet me again are probably around one third.`
` He bet his own life on those odds,`
` wishing for a reunion with me for the last bit of his remaining life."`
`".........You're saying he gathered our family for the sake of that fucked‐up ritual?!`
` Oh, yeah, real fucking funny!!`
` Don't say stuff like that, damn it!!"`
`"It was according to the contract from the beginning.`
` When Kinzo's life ended,`
` all of the gold I had lent him, and all of the assets that Kinzo had created, were to be received by me."`
`"......Kinzo put me through a nightmareish ordeal,`
` but thinking back on it now, it was an extraordinary period, even amid the past thousand years.`
` After all, the natural enemy of a witch is boredom.`
` To Kinzo, who offered me a chance to run away from that for several decades,`
` yes, considering that among other things, I might have a slight debt to him."`
`"I decided to go along with Kinzo's game.`
` And so, first off, Kinzo returns to me the Ushiromiya family Head's Ring.`
` It is the house revived by my gold, you see."`
`".........Then I choose thirteen people arbitrarily as sacrifices.`
` And as that unfolds, you people are thrown into total confusion,`
` and show me various aspects of the fabric of human relationships as you stand against me, which gives me great pleasure.`
` I really do like this game of Kinzo's!`
` *cackle*cackle*."`
`"Aaaaaaaaaahh!!`
` I definitely won't believe in that kind of magic story!`
` ......Then who are you?!`
` You fell off a cliff and died, dammit!`
` Your soul slipped out, became butterflies, and went to the forest?`
` That's all a load of bullshit!!"`
`"But you are here!`
` Who are you?!!`
` Aren't you the 19th person?!"`
`"That is true, I most surely am the 19th person.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` But it's no good, I'm afraid...?`
` It's no goddamn good at all!!"`
`"`
`{p:1:There are no more than 18 humans on this Rokkenjima}!"`
`"Wha, ...............what did you saaaaaaay......`
` So you're saying......the X of the 18+X doesn't exist?!`
` Are you saying the piece that I took...{0}{nobreak:the X}...{0}doesn't exist?!"`
`"Pu ku ku ku...`
` That is what it means.`
` You have my condolences.`
` ...However, Milady, you truly are a fast worker.`
` I thought you would let him flounder around a little more before turning everything over at the end.`
` Well then, Battler‐sama, would some more tea be agreeable to you?"`
`"I, I don't want any, damn it!!`
` I don't believe!`
` The culprit can't be one of the 18!"`
`"Then, what the hell are you, why are you here?!!`
` If the 19th person doesn't exist, then are you saying you're one of the 18 in disguise?!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` For you, although you are reluctant to use it,`
` doubting one of the 18 will serve as a final escape route, much like castling."`
`".........However, for me, the hard part is just beginning.`
` You need only throw away appearances,`
` and you can prepare a culprit freely amid the 18 people!`
` Finding a route through those 18 pieces,`
` in order to checkmate you and force you to accept me,`
` .........will be truly difficult."`
`"Like hell I'd do that!!`
` I won't doubt any of the 18!`
` I don't want to doubt!!`
` Have I really been cornered here again...?!`
` Damn it, damn it damn it!!"`
`"It looks like my game with you, which has lasted three rounds, is finally entering the endgame, doesn't it?`
` There's nowhere to run anymore, you know?`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` You don't want to doubt any of those beloved people in the 18, riiight? I can take that burden from you if you want?`
` And yet, why do you refuse me?"`
`"They say you should play the opening like a book, the middle game like a magician,`
` and the endgame like a machine.`
` I'll corner you from here on.`
` Slowly, carefully, ...surely.`
` Or, on the other hand, would it be better if I pressed you all at once, as would be fitting for you?"`
`"That should suit you, let's do that.`
` I already have a thorough knowledge of which methods of attack you cannot handle!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle* hihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!!"`
