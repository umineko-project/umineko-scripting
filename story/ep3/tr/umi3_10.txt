`The true enemy of holding a fort probably isn't the fear of unseen enemies.`
` It's whether you can keep it going over a long period of time.`
`Maria had gotten bored and had started making a ruckus because she wanted to watch TV.`
` Since there was no TV in the lobby, she decided to return to the cousins' room upstairs.`
`The adults probably didn't want to leave Maria all on her own, among other reasons.`
` They told all the children to go to the cousins' room upstairs.`
`George, his heart wounded by the loss of his fiancée, had no willpower to resist that, and led the cousins upstairs.`
`At first, Nanjo had been reading a book in the lobby,`
` but when he noticed that the relatives looked like they wanted to talk about something shady,`
` he said "It seems I am in the way..." and returned to his room upstairs.`
`".........I'm starving.`
` And if I keep just sitting around, my drowsiness will be even worse."`
`"It's only natural.`
` Because we didn't sleep last night."`
`"...We will probably end up barricaded here for a full 24 hours.`
` It may be wiser to take naps in turn instead of over‐stressing ourselves."`
`"I agree.`
` My husband and I will be here, so anyone who finds this difficult should rest without overdoing it."`
`"They might be expecting that, you know?`
` They may not be able to defeat this many people, but if that number was reduced by a certain amount, they may plan to use that to their advantage."`
`"There are seven of us here.`
` Two of us could rest for three hours at a time.`
` ......It's a long time until tomorrow morning.`
` We still have some energy now, but tonight's going to be tough."`
`"Sure will be.`
` Anyone sleepy?`
` Don't overdo it, rest."`
`Hideyoshi looked around at everyone to see who wanted to sleep first, but no one volunteered.`
`...Everyone was just as tired, but no one was bold enough to be able to sleep now.`
` ......Their fear of the unknown culprit was just as strong as their sleepiness.`
`"......Nobody?`
` Well, don't overdo it, everyone."`
`"If we get tired, we can think about it then.`
` ......I certainly am tired, but I'm not in the mood now."`
`Eva spoke sharply, and then read once more over the second letter from {f:5:Beatrice}, which had been found in the boiler room.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} had sent them two letters, and had repeatedly told them to solve the riddle of the epitaph.`
`And she had even provoked them by saying she would give up the inheritance, both assets and headship, if it could be solved...`
`Eva took out a notebook and opened it to a page with the epitaph copied onto it.`
`"............Is that the epitaph?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......Although it's annoying to do as the culprit says,`
` after all, we do have time to waste.`
` I think it's the perfect way to stave off boredom."`
`"...Not a bad way to kill time.`
` Why don't we challenge it together as siblings?"`
`"......Can I borrow that?`
` I'll rewrite it just a little larger.`
` Natsuhi‐san, do you have a slightly larger piece of paper?"`
`"There should be paper in the servant room.`
` I will bring some."`
`Natsuhi immediately brought a B4 blank sheet of paper from the servant room.`
`Kyrie borrowed Eva's notebook, wrote out the epitaph on the paper, and laid it out on the table.`
`Straight away, everyone peered down at it.`
`{n}...A fence of people naturally formed.`
`"I've heard about it, but...`
`...really, this is a tough riddle.`
` I don't have a clue what it's talking about."`
`"At one point, I also did my best to challenge it, but I was just as clueless."`
`"If we did know, we wouldn't have come all the way out here with a plan to make money.`
` After all, it's ten tons of gold."`
`"............This is the first time I've read it seriously, but...`
`...roughly speaking, couldn't it be split into three parts?"`
`"...I've been thinking this since last night, but you really do seem to be a good thinker, Kyrie‐san.`
` It's possible that you could easily solve this riddle that we couldn't."`
`"Yeah.`
` Kyrie's sharp.`
` ......She might be able to tackle it in an interesting way if we don't give her any strange preconceptions."`
`".........Yes.`
` Kyrie‐san.`
` Will you let us hear your honest thoughts having read the epitaph?"`
`"I think it probably won't be very useful to all of you.`
` You all give me too much credit."`
`"No way, anything that comes to mind would be helpful.`
` Let us hear what you have to say.`
` ......Because your hints always help me when I'm worried."`
`"Oh, so they were helpful?`
` It's nice to finally hear about this now."`
`"Come ooon, don't I always thank you?"`
`"You two do get along well.`
` I'm jealous."`
`"And the rest of us would also love to accept your hints.`
` It's alright, we're just killing time anyway, so why not relax?"`
`Kyrie was bewildered by all this praise she was suddenly receiving.`
`...But they had plenty of time.`
` She realized that this was just a way to waste time, and she decided to accept that role...`
`"......I'm sure I'll say something off the mark, but...`
`well, I'll put forward my ideas."`
`"Mmhm.`
` ......What did you mean in the beginning, about how, roughly speaking, it could be divided into three parts?"`
`"Well...I just mean what I said.`
` I think that overall, the epitaph can be divided into three parts."`
`"First, there are the five lines up to and including "There the {loghint:kagi:key} to the {loghint:ougon:gold} sleeps".`
` Up until this point is the first part, which points to the location of the key."`
`"And then there's the part formed by the eleven lines up until the tenth twilight, which refer to the location of the {loghint:ougonkyou:Golden Land} itself."`
`"And the remaining six lines make up the part after the Golden Land has been reached."`
`"I see.`
` The key, the Golden Land,`
` and the Golden Land's {loghint:takara:treasure}; it can be divided into these three parts."`
`"Even we have been able to grasp that much.`
` The three sections that refer to the key, the door, and the treasure."`
`"...Nii‐san, don't butt in any more than you have to!`
` Let Kyrie‐san speak her ideas freely."`
`"Kyrie.`
` Please continue.`
` ......We recognize the same thing regarding what you said.`
` So then?"`
`"......I wonder what that thing in the beginning, the "{loghint:natsukashiki:beloved} {loghint:kokyou:home of old}", means.`
` Thinking about it normally, would it refer to Grandfather's home?"`
`"Since he explicitly mentioned that it's {loghint:natsukashiki:beloved}, I can imagine that it's a home he thought about very deeply.`
` ......Didn't Father come from Odawara?"`
`".........Odawara is definitely where he was born,`
` but I don't think this home Father loved was Odawara.`
` I believe all of us siblings are thinking of the same place."`
`"...Yes.`
` This probably isn't Odawara.`
` From what I've heard, he had a very fun time as a youth."`
`"Hahhaha.`
` ...Dad's greatest misfortune in his life was probably being made the Ushiromiya family head."`
`"......Probably.`
` Father really hadn't wanted to become the Ushiromiya family head."`
`"So where is it?`
` And is there a {loghint:kawa:river} where {loghint:ayu:sweetfish} swim?"`
`"......Maybe there was at the time.`
` I'm sure that there has been a lot of development there by now, so the sweetfish might have disappeared.`
` It would be extremely difficult to investigate whether there were sweetfish there during the time Grandfather was a boy."`
`"There's not just one river, either.`
` I believe we all investigated thoroughly in a geographical sense.`
` ......You even went to the actual place to investigate directly, didn't you, Eva?"`
`"That was only as a vacation.`
` ......But the townscape had changed completely from Father's time.`
` After all, there was a war in between.`
` It was impossible to even figure out where Father actually lived.`
` ...Probably, even if Father dragged himself to the actual location,`
` by now, even he wouldn't be able to determine where it was that he lived."`
`"They've had a remarkable revival over there, after all..."`
`"............Doesn't any place name come clearly to mind after hearing "{loghint:ayu no kawa:sweetfish river}"?"`
`"Not really.`
` I mean, they're sweetfish, right?`
` People say they live in rivers with {loghint:kirei:clean} {loghint:mizu:water}, so there are countless rivers we could guess at.`
` Any {loghint:ogawa:stream} that Dad innocently went {loghint:ayuzuri:sweetfish‐fishing} in was probably buried by the development later.`
` It would be different if we had a map from before the war, or a person who knew a lot about how the area was before the war, but..."`
`"......It probably isn't something like that."`
`"What do you mean...?"`
`".........Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old.`
` You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key.`
` ...After these two lines, there is a single blank line."`
`"...Something is being presented with just these two lines.`
` I would suppose the next three lines continue based upon that something."`
`"I wonder what it is that's being presented, then...?"`
`"......I don't know.`
` In any case, after just these two lines, it's not something vague like you don't know which river it is...`
`you're able to narrow it down and say specifically what "{loghint:kawa:river}"."`
`"......It may be that this isn't a "river" with water flowing down it.`
` ...The "sweetfish river" might be some kind of metaphor.`
` ......What kind of image does the word sweetfish have?"`
`".........Sweetfish are like {loghint:shake:salmon}.`
` They're {loghint:tansui‐gyo:freshwater fish}, but they go out into the {loghint:umi:ocean} right after they're born.`
` And when they get big, they return to the river to live there,`
` and then they {loghint:sanran:spawn} there and end their lives there."`
`"Well, they leave their home at one point, but the part about them getting big and returning there to lay {loghint:tamago:eggs},`
` that might have a family prosperity type of image."`
`"Huh.`
` They're freshwater fish, but they can live in the {loghint:kaisui:ocean}?`
` I didn't know that.`
` I thought they were {loghint:kawa‐zakana:river fish}, so they couldn't go out into the sea."`
`"And they are also called {ruby:kougyo:{p:0:香魚}} (aroma fish) because they have a pleasant smell.`
` I have never eaten one, but I have heard that they are very delicious when {loghint:shioyaki:grilled with salt}."`
`"Whoa, Natsuhi‐san!`
` You've never eaten salt‐grilled sweetfish?!`
` They're delicious!`
` I'll treat you sometime!"`
`"It is a food for commoners.`
` It isn't appropriate for your mouth."`
`"......This is just my wild idea,`
` ...but the image I get from a sweetfish river has made me suspect a {loghint:kakeizu:family tree} before.`
` The sweetfish go out into the ocean for a time, but they return to the river where they were born to spawn, right?`
` .........It makes me think about myself."`
`"......You're right.`
` I can confess now...`
`that I have sometimes suspected that it refers to you and Maria‐chan."`
`"I see.`
` ......As you travel down it, you will see a village.`
` The only "village" ({ruby:sato:{p:0:里}}) you'll find by going down the family tree is the one in Maria's name ({p:0:真里亞})."`
`"Right?!`
` ......But as you all know, Father has a dislike of Maria,`
` and he has almost never spoken with her."`
`"Besides which, Father once told me to give Maria a completely different name.`
` I just made it Maria on my own.`
` Father was very mad about that."`
`"......If you think about the history there,`
` I just really couldn't imagine that he'd reference Maria's name in his precious epitaph about who would inherit his wealth and the family headship."`
`"Have you ever let Maria‐chan read the epitaph?"`
`"Um, yes. Of course I have.`
` But she didn't seem to have a clue.`
` ......She didn't have a clue, and she kept going on about that same occult stuff, about how it was a {loghint:fukkatsu:resurrection} {loghint:gishiki:ceremony} for the witch."`
`"............A connection between Father and Maria.`
` ...Certainly, they do share that occult hobby, but they never interacted.`
` ...I can't imagine it refers to Maria either."`
`"......What interests me is the fact that he explicitly added the word "{loghint:natsukashiki:beloved}" at the beginning.`
` ......Like you all said just now,`
` if Father was reluctant about becoming the Ushiromiya family head,`
` would he describe it that way?`
` ...I don't think it is Odawara, which points back to the Ushiromiya {loghint:honke:main family}."`
`"......I believe that this word "beloved" here at the beginning...`
`definitely refers to a place full of very important memories to Father."`
`"...............Hmmmmmm.`
` ...Well, that's fine.`
` It'd be hard to pinpoint since we don't have a clue about a map from that time,`
` but anyway, there were probably several rivers with sweetfish swimming in them near Dad's home during his youth."`
`"That's if it's a river with water flowing down it, right?`
` And then?`
` Go on, Kyrie‐san."`
`"......I don't really understand the three lines starting with "As you travel down it, you will see a village".`
` ...These are probably coupled with the two lines about the sweetfish river."`
`"It's probably something that we would automatically understand if we knew what the sweetfish river really was.`
` ...As long as we don't understand that, it's probably useless to try and solve those three lines any further."`
`"So we're screwed unless we know what the "sweetfish river" really is...`
` And there's no guarantee it even means a literal river."`
`"...Seriously.`
` The heck does it mean by sweetfish?`
` Were they a {loghint:koubutsu:favorite dish} of Dad's?`
` Or is there some special meaning?`
` Is it pointless to read too deeply into it?"`
`"...If you don't have both a micro and a macro perspective, your field of vision grows narrow.`
` ......Think not too deeply, about a river with {loghint:sakana:fish} swimming in it, or some kind of {loghint:nagare:flow},`
` ...something you can {loghint:kudaru:go down} or {loghint:noboru:go up},`
` keep those kinds of abstract images in mind, and we may be able to come up with more out‐of‐the‐box ideas."`
`"And via the three lines that follow, the answer for the "sweetfish river" ends up at the "key to the Golden Land"..."`
`"If you think about it this way, I wonder if it was a mistake to split it into three parts.`
` There's actually four parts.`
` ......‘Go down the sweetfish river’,`
` "find the key to the Golden Land",`
` "journey to the Golden Land",`
` and "the treasure of the Golden Land"."`
`"Hmmm... ......Truly interesting.`
` While we have this opportunity,`
` would you mind continuing and telling us your opinion about the most central portion of the {loghint:hibun:epitaph},`
` up until the {loghint:dai‐juu no ban:tenth twilight} where we arrive at the Golden Land?"`
`"......That's the most symbolic, ...and also the most disturbing part."`
`"Since it keeps mentioning the word {loghint:ikenie:sacrifice},`
` I can't help but think it has something to do with Father's occult {loghint:gishiki:rituals}...`
` .........How do you see it, Kyrie‐san?"`
`Kyrie recrossed her arms several times,`
` peering into the paper with the epitaph copied onto it as though she was looking through it...`
`"...........................`
` .........This is...very difficult.`
` ...By starting with "You who laid {loghint:te:hand} upon the key",`
` it probably means that you won't be able to continue without understanding the key.`
` ...I'll have to give up, but I'll take a shot at it anyway."`
`"......Just like how the "sweetfish river" isn't necessarily a river with water flowing down it,`
` it is also doubtful whether this "key" is actually something shaped like a key."`
`"Right.`
` There's also the possibility that it's a code or a keyword.`
` ......After all, this key isn't something to be stuck into a keyhole.`
` It's something that selects the six people to be sacrifices for the first twilight."`
`"In that sense, we can state that this key isn't something to open the door to the Golden Land."`
`"......But what a disturbing key.`
` A key that can select six people to be sacrifices..."`
`"How would a key {loghint:erabu:select} anything?`
` ...Does it spin around like a roulette...?"`
`"This key points towards a certain specific group of {loghint:roku‐nin:six people}.`
` ......No, we should say it points to a certain specific group of {loghint:muttsu:six things}.`
` ......If this doesn't mean a literal command to offer sacrifices.`
` ...For example, it could be an anagram."`
`"An anagram?`
` Do you mean a word game...?"`
`"Yes.`
` Ever since Rosa started talking about the family tree and how "village" was a part of Maria‐chan's name,`
` this has constantly been going through my mind."`
`"......It seems as though Rudolf‐san, for example, has run with the words "beloved home of old",`
` and is assuming that it has to something to do with {loghint:chikei:geography} or {loghint:zahyou:coordinates}, but that might not be true.`
` This could be some kind of puzzle, ...or maybe playing with letters."`
`"......I'm sorry.`
` What do you mean by playing with letters?"`
`"Oh yeah, it's like "sucker merry barrellers".`
` What do you get when you take out the e's and r's?`
` Like that.`
` Well, you were raised well, Natsuhi‐san, so you probably haven't heard that one."`
`"Take out the e's and r's? Huh?`
` ???"`
`"Don't.`
` It is an undignified game, inappropriate for you."`
`Only Natsuhi didn't get it and had a blank look on her face.`
`It seemed that she had only guessed the answer had to be something undignified,`
` after hearing Rudolf and Eva's snickers.`
`"Ah, ...Natsuhi nee‐san, it's something like this.`
` There was something like it in Maria's book of puzzles, okay?`
` There's this thing called the Tanuki Notebook."`
`"There's a notebook written in some kind of code, with a lot of "ta"s mixed in,`
` and if you "{ruby:nuki:remove}" all of the "ta"s, then the true sentences pop up.`
` It's a game like that."`
`"Ah......oh, I see.`
` .........??"`
`Natsuhi finally realized the answer to the undignified riddle Rudolf had posed, and her face grew red as she hung her head in embarrassment.`
`"...............So maybe that "remove" part is actually represented by "{loghint:korosu:kill}"...?"`
`"Yes.`
` I was just thinking that too.`
` It's possible that the key to the Golden Land is a word with {loghint:roku‐moji:six characters}."`
`"In other words, ...the "ta" from the Tanuki Notebook...is actually six characters here...?`
` Hmmm, ...this is gettin' complicated..."`
`"Playing with letters, is it...`
` ......Hmmm.`
` In Japan, it really feels like a child's game, but it seems that it is a stylish form of humor among intellectuals in the English‐speaking world.`
` ...It is easy to imagine that Father showed interest in it."`
`"......But right here, I quickly lose my ability to understand it.`
` Up until this point, while it was filled with mystery, it was extremely sequential."`
`"‘Sweetfish river’, "go down it", "then find the key" is all extremely sequential.`
` And we can guess that we gain a six‐character key as a result,`
` ......but in that case, we now don't know {i:what} we kill the six characters from."`
`"That's a point.`
` What do we subtract the six characters from?`
` It doesn't tell us."`
`"...On the second twilight, it says "{loghint:nokosareshi mono wa:those who remain}".`
` ......Which means that, at the very least, that "something" has a finite number of characters.`
` You could read it like it's telling you to continue with the {loghint:nokotta:remaining} characters after the six characters are removed."`
`".........And yet, we don't know what this "something" is, even though it should have been shown to us at the beginning.`
` ...Were we wrong even to assume that this is playing with letters...?"`
`".....................hmmmmm..."`
`Everyone crossed their arms and fell into silence.`
`It felt like they were about to reach a novel understanding that they hadn't been able to before...but they stumbled just one step before it.`
`At that time, Hideyoshi's stomach rumbled heartily.`
`The silence up until then was broken by laughter.`
`"Sorry, sorry.`
` By spinnin' the gears in my head for a change, my stomach's gone completely empty.`
` Looks like skippin' breakfast really takes its toll on me...wahahahahaha."`
`"Natsuhi.`
` Is there nothing here?"`
`"There should at least be enough set aside for breakfast.`
` I will prepare it."`
`"I'm also starving.`
` I'll bet those brats above us are starving too.`
` ...But I doubt there's enough for 18 people here, and for three meals."`
`"You're right there.`
` It'll be a marathon to tomorrow.`
` It might be better if we took a trip back to the mansion and fished around for some canned food or something in the kitchen."`
`"There's nothing more than crackers and snacks, but if that is alright, I can prepare them.`
` But with this many people, there might not be any left for lunch..."`
`"That will be fine for now.`
` Sorry, but would you prepare it for us?"`
`It looked like the men had been taken over with an appetite that stopped all thought.`
`The atmosphere grew more peaceful, and the epitaph investigation meeting broke up for the time being.`
`But Eva kept staring at the paper the epitaph was written on like she was going to burn a hole through it...`
`"............A word game was nothing more than my theory.`
` There is a chance that it's mistaken.`
` Eva‐san, don't take it too seriously, okay...?"`
`".........Thank you.`
` This is something I've decided to do myself.`
` Would you mind leaving me alone?"`
`Eva spoke coldly.`
`...Kyrie didn't bother her any more, and went to help Natsuhi prepare breakfast.`
`"Nee‐san.`
` Shouldn't we also help prepare breakfast?"`
`"Then you go help.`
` I'm busy solving this!"`
`"S‐sorry...`
` Th‐then I'll go help..."`
`".........Come {i:on}.`
` Why are you like this?"`
`"......Huh?"`
`"The Ushiromiya family inheritance will be given to the person who solves this epitaph.`
` You seem to have given up from the beginning, as though it has nothing to do with you,`
` but if you could solve it, even you have the opportunity to inherit the family headship."`
`"......This is a chance to steal everything from Nii‐san.`
` Why aren't you seriously trying to solve it for that once‐in‐a‐lifetime chance?"`
`"...Um, .........umm, ......I......"`
`Rosa hung her head, troubled over how she should answer.`
`{n}...She regretted, for the first time in a while, carelessly speaking to her sister when she was in a bad mood.`
`"If you've noticed anything, say so.`
` Even though Kyrie‐san and I were seriously reasoning, you just kept nodding your head, didn't you?`
` Come on.`
` Isn't there anything you've noticed?`
` Come on!"`
`".........Uh,`
` .........umm,`
` .........`
` ......Isn't...this strange?"`
`"...Strange?`
` What is?"`
`"Umm, ......this word, {loghint:ougonkyou:Golden Land}.`
` The word Golden Land comes up several times."`
`"So what?`
` Do you get some keywords by splitting up the characters in "Golden Land"?"`
`"Um, umm, that's not it.`
` ......Look, isn't just the tenth twilight strange?"`
`"...............Huh?`
` ......ah."`
`"Even though they're all written the "Golden Land" ({ruby:ougonkyou:{p:0:黄金郷}}), for some reason, this one place has the "Home of the Gold" ({ruby:ougon no sato:{p:0:黄金の郷}}).`
` He explicitly mixed in the character {ruby:no:{p:0:の}}, changing the phrasing.`
` It vaguely bugged me that it's only said differently here..."`
`".........ah, umm, ...it's not like it means anything.`
` This is Father we're talking about.`
` It could just be a coincidental change in how he said the word."`
`".........................................."`
`".........Boring."`
`"Oh? What is boring...?"`
`".........Boring, boring."`
`"Well now.`
` I don't have the foggiest idea what this child is grumbling about."`
`"She is probably dissatisfied that you gave Battler‐sama various hints, Madam."`
`"......Noooope?`
` I'm not dissatisfied about that.`
` I'm actually {i:more} satisfied now that that worthless Battler has finally reached the level where he can go along with me."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` Was I a little too friendly with Battler‐kun?`
` Maybe it would be better if the old people went away and left everything to the young kids."`
`"Pu ku ku ku ku..."`
`When {f:5:Virgilia} and Ronove giggled and cackled,`
` {f:5:Beatrice}'s irritation meter finally reached its limit.`
`"Ahhhh, the both of you joining forces and laughing at me!`
` Ronove, hide yourself for a while!`
` Go away, go awaaaay!"`
`"Certainly.`
` Then, I will rest for a while.`
` Pukkukukuku..."`
`Ronove bowed his head, still laughing, and hid himself.`
`After that, all that remained was the figure of {f:5:Beatrice}, who was grumpy and irritated,`
` and {f:5:Virgilia}, who was coolly enjoying her tea.`
`"...............When you said "{p:1:There are no more than 18 people on this island}", you actually cornered yourself."`
`".........I thought so...`
` ............I thought it might have been a {i:little} too early, but...`
` ......I guess it really was......"`
`"If you had led him further astray beforehand, things might have been different,`
` but it really was a futile trump card.`
` You stirred him up instead."`
`In addition to his victory condition of denying the witch,`
` Battler had held onto a different victory condition, since he had wanted to explain things without suspecting any of the 18.`
`Hadn't he been at his weakest when he was being tossed about by these two opposing goals?`
`However, {f:5:Beatrice} had used the red carelessly, and had proclaimed that there were no more than 18 people.`
`...Because of that, Battler had been forced to suspect one of the 18,`
` .........and he had finally begun to build up the readiness that he needed to accept that.`
`Battler was stubborn,`
` but because of that, when he was struck where he was fragile, fissures would crack all over him, like breaking china.`
`That itself should have been his greatest weak point...`
`".........Kuuuuuu.`
` ......Maybe I got a bit too careless after my overwhelming victory last time......"`
`"Yes, you were too careless.`
` ...The last game was a difficult one for Battler‐kun,`
` but it seems...`
`this game will prove a difficult one {i:for you}."`
`"......A broken vase will definitely never return to its original form.`
` ...So it would be more constructive to think of the next move, rather than regretfully picking up the pieces."`
`".........But now that Battler has all the right ideas in his head, how should I plot against him...?"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` Your troubled face is an even better treat than Ronove's cookies."`
`"......Uu.`
` You and Battler and even Ronove keep treating me like a snack.`
` ...Even though I'm not sweet at allll."`
`With a shameful, childlike face that she would never have shown in front of Battler,`
` {f:5:Beatrice} rolled her head around on top of the table.`
`"............Masteeer.`
` .........At least a hiiint."`
`"Oh?`
` What kind of hint?"`
`"If you know a skillful move that will make Battler speechless, and make him want to accept me,`
` I won't ask you to say it outright, so, umm,`
` ...even if it's just a hint..."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, I can't.`
` I am acting as Battler‐kun's ally right now,`
` so I cannot teach you something that would give you an advantage."`
`"...You don't have to be so strict...`
` Your disciple's in troubllle..."`
`"I believe you harshly boasted that you had surpassed your master, correct?"`
`".........Uu...`
` Please act like the old person you are and give me just a bit of your cunning wisdom...`
` Pleease...`
` It's mean if you only help Battleeer..."`
`"My, my.`
` You're still a spoiled child."`
`"......But, it's true that I may have given Battler‐kun a few too many hints.`
` It did serve as a scolding to you,`
` but perhaps it was a little too much support for a fair game."`
`"You see, you see...?`
` Please, Masteeer, at least just a hint to help me on..."`
`"..................Just a hint.`
` Think about what it means by yourself, alright?"`
`"Yeah, yeah!`
` I'll think about it myself, so please!`
` Please, give me one that'll leave Battler down in the dumps, Masterrrr."`
`It was truly shameful how she behaved when Battler wasn't around, even though she acted utterly like a Great Witch in front of him.`
`{f:5:Virgilia} sighed, lamenting under her breath that Beato never seemed to grow up.`
`"Then just a hint.`
` ......Do you know of Aesop's fable, The North Wind and the Sun?"`
`"Of course.`
` It's a story about how the north wind and the sun challenge each other to steal the cloak of a traveler, right?"`
`"That's right.`
` The moral is that violent or impatient methods aren't always necessarily the best decisions."`
`"......You don't have to tell me that.`
` I have already reflected on the fact that I rushed too fast towards victory."`
`"...............`
` Think well about what this means.`
` And furthermore,`
` ......although it seems that Battler‐kun had a slight misunderstanding as well, you too seem to be under a misapprehension.`
` Do you understand the victory conditions of this game?"`
`"...What else is there, other than making Battler submit to me?"`
`".........See?`
` At that point, you are already mistaken."`
`"How am I mistaken?"`
`"Your victory isn't making Battler‐kun submit.`
` ......It is to get Battler‐kun to accept your existence, is it not?"`
`"......What's this?`
` You want me to butter up Battler, and ask him to "Accept me as a witch, pleease?"!`
` How foolish!`
` I will not sink so low!"`
`Grrrrrrrrrrr..., Beato growled, like a dog in a bad mood.`
`{f:5:Virgilia} shrugged her shoulders, snickering at her disciple, who was as short‐tempered as always...`
`"That is my hint.`
` Now you should think deeply.`
` .........In any event, your moves up until now will not work on Battler‐kun.`
` A significant tactical conversion will probably be required."`
`"...I know that even without you telling me.`
` ......I don't have a clue what you mean by the North Wind and the Sun,`
` but anyway, I understand that I will have to change my direction.`
` ......I'll showcase a clever scheme that will surprise even you, Master...!"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` I look forward to it.`
` I wonder how Battler‐kun will tackle that.`
` ......I will be wishing you good luck as well."`
`"After Battler, right?`
` Hmph..."`
`".........Are you going to give up and resign already?`
` If you're that tired, why not just go into a futon and sleep forever...?"`
`...As my consciousness grew vague and I pretended to fight my drowsiness, sinking deeper and deeper into the sofa,`
` "I" scolded "myself".`
`"......Don't you remember how much you dreamed about stealing the position of family head from Krauss...?"`
`"Even though I gave you that chance with my magic, you're already throwing it away...?"`
`You say that, but...`
` ............This riddle is really difficult.`
`Even a wire puzzle would be better.`
`...At least in that case, you're assured that it definitely is solvable.`
`But with this epitaph riddle, I don't know if I'm even assured that.`
`......I might just be fighting a useless battle.`
`...Still hazy, I looked at the notebook which I had been holding the whole time.`
`It was opened to the page with the epitaph, which I had stared at, almost burned a hole through, on so many hundreds of nights I had lost count.`
`......That...is truly a door.`
`On the other side...is the "Golden Land", that place which ever since I was a child I've wished to reach, I've spared no effort to reach,`
` ...and I've never been able to reach.`
`Here I am with both hands upon the door,`
` ...and even though the book, no, the door is open, I still cannot reach the other side?`
`"...That's right.`
` You already have your hands upon the door.`
` Come, open it with all of your strength.`
` And read the characters written on the door."`
`".........Open it...`
`with all my strength.`
` ...Read the characters...`
`written on the door..."`
`Strain your eyes.`
` ......See through to what lies further beyond the epitaph written in the notebook...`
`"...The "beloved home of old" definitely won't betray our expectations.`
` ......The only past that Father held dear was his years as a boy."`
`That's right......`
` Then what about the "sweetfish river"?`
`There are several rivers where they swim, and it's dubious whether there was one very near the place that Father lived.`
`...If we start wondering which river that's home to sweetfish is closest in a cartographical sense...`
`things will quickly get vague and we won't be able to pin it down...`
`"......Didn't you say it yourself?`
` You said it didn't have to be a river with water flowing down it.`
` ......If the word sweetfish is too complicated, why not forget it forever...?"`
`"Think of a river.`
` A river.`
` Linking it with a "family tree" wasn't a bad idea.`
` Try thinking about how to link a river with something else along those lines......"`
`......Not a river?`
` Even though the sweetfish can't swim in it if it isn't a river?`
`Oh, but maybe "sweetfish can swim in it" means it joins up with the ocean......`
`My husband did say that, despite being river fish, they go out into the ocean... ...............`
`.......................................`
` ...............With the ocean.`
`........................No,`
` ...but,`
` .........`
` ......Huh...?`
`"......Did you notice?`
` But that's just a faint memory.`
` There should be a book archive somewhere around here.`
` If you investigate, you can make sure."`
`......If that's the "sweetfish river".........`
` .........And if the key might be a six‐character word...`
`.....................Is the key really resting in that river?`
`I, I don't know, I don't know.`
`{n}...Anyway, I have to search in an atlas...`
`But, even if I know that, I don't know {i:from what} I should take the six characters...`
`"......You really don't know?`
` Think deeply.`
` .........We're too smart for our own good, so our thoughts are inflexible."`
`"Don't think of it like it's something as grandiose as "The Riddle of the Epitaph", but like it's a child's puzzle.`
` ......Men are always children, no matter how old they get.`
` Even if Father has advanced into old age,`
` that doesn't change the fact that he is essentially a child inside his heart."`
`".........Throw away your awe of Father.`
` ...Think of this like it's a worthless, infantile puzzle game, like the ones Maria suddenly brings up on the boat."`
`......Puzzles.`
` ......Worthless, infantile.`
`........................`
` .....................Huh, .........ah.`
`.........I'm sure that was, ...what was it, ......umm, umm......`
`...I'm sure, if my memory isn't wrong, ......that was probably, umm...`
`No, I don't have to rely on my vague memory.`
`{n}I should be able to figure that out immediately too by searching in the archive.`
`".........We've probably already realized the answer.`
` ...All that's left is to research whether that's correct or not."`
`"Come, Eva.`
` Let's go to the archive and make sure no one notices.`
` ......There, we should find a mountain of thick books that didn't fit in Father's study.`
` ...I'm sure that we'll find a book that answers our question.`
` .........Quickly.`
` This is our first and last chance in our life to have our dreams made true."`
`When Natsuhi tried to lay a blanket over her, Eva suddenly jumped up.`
`"...I'm sorry.`
` I seem to have woken you."`
`"......Eva.`
` If you're sleepy, don't overdo it.`
` You rest first."`
`"Th‐......thank you.`
` I'm just going to the lavatory for a bit to wash my face."`
`"You should take it easy and rest.`
` ...Your health'll take another bad turn, you know?"`
`"I said I'm fine, really!`
` I'll be right back."`
`Leaving only those words behind, I left the lobby at a brisk pace.`
`The lobby was partitioned off by a door, so as soon as I went into the corridor, they could no longer see me.`
`......The archive was next to the servant room.`
`Father always owned a vast book collection,`
` but after he started to become engrossed with his occult hobby, his library of those kinds of books grew even larger,`
` so that the normal books suitable for a normal study had been forced out as his study overflowed.`
`This archive was where those normal books were stored.`
`They were all stiff books for intellectuals, like complete volume sets of encyclopedias,`
` but that was very convenient for me now that I was investigating something.`
`I entered softly, ......and just in case, I checked the room with my gun readied, making sure that there were no suspicious people there.`
`Then I locked it from the inside.`
`I actually wasn't thinking that the murderer might be hiding somewhere.`
`...What scared me was my fear that one of the siblings might hear what I was investigating.`
`My heart had started jumping......`
`{n}...I had been half‐asleep until a short time ago, so I hadn't been able to realize how significant this thing I had realized was.`
`But as I started to become aware, ......my heart started feeling like it was about to explode.`
`".........I...wonder if any of the other siblings have realized this......"`
`I don't think Krauss and Rudolf will realize.`
`......But I don't know about Kyrie.`
`She has extraordinarily good intuition.`
`.........And I don't know about Rosa either.`
`"Rosa is as dim as the others.`
` She always has been, and ridiculously so."`
`Really...?`
` I think she was wise enough to make you think she was dim, so that she didn't earn herself unnecessary malice.`
`".........Here it is.`
` ...I wonder if we'll find it in this one."`
`I pulled the book out, and flipped through the pages......`
`"...............Oh.`
` .........This is...`
`......`
`a "sweetfish river"...?"`
`I see...`
`This is what the sweetfish river means.`
`......Don't dawdle around, research further.`
`"Y‐yes, I know...`
` As you travel down it, you will see a village ({ruby:sato:{p:0:里}})...`
` {ruby:sato:{p:0:里}} is an older word for {loghint:machi:town} or {loghint:mura:village}, right?`
` But it's a densely populated area... There's any number of those..."`
`Why have you stopped thinking?!`
`If you don't like it, why not quit forever...?`
`Why not just hand over the Ushiromiya headship to Kyrie forever?!`
`"I, ...I don't want to...`
` I will become the head.`
` ...This is my first and last chance to do that...`
` ......What is {i:village}?`
` What does it mean?!`
` Is there a village if you go down this "river"......?!`
` ............ah, .........`
`aaaaaaaahhh......!!"`
`......In {loghint:sono sato:that village}, look for the {loghint:kishi:shore} {loghint:futari:the two} {loghint:kuchi:speak} of.`
`......It's a "shore" ({ruby:kishi:{p:0:岸}}).`
` Understand?`
`"Uh, ...*gulp*...`
` I, I, I understand...!`
` Shore, ......shore.........!"`
`All those pieces that I hadn't been able to understand at all were...`
`...right before my eyes, starting to...`
`...snap,`
` snap into place, all by themselves......`
`I couldn't even remember to close my open mouth.`
`{n}...My throat grew completely dry...`
`Is it......really alright for this to be the answer?`
`{n}R‐really?`
` Really...?!`
`"...But this isn't six characters at all.`
` ......I'm absolutely sure that this is the answer, but this doesn't reach six characters at all...!"`
`Did you stop thinking again?`
` In that case, think of a way you could read it with six characters.`
`If you can't think of one, then research it.`
`......There has to be an answer.`
` You must not doubt that.`
`If you can't believe that, why don't you cry yourself to sleep, and then just give up and die forever...?`
`"............One,`
` two,`
` three,`
` four,`
` five,`
` six...`
` ......Oooh,`
` ...s‐`
`......`
`six characters...`
`"`
`"......I,`
` ......I found it.`
` ...This is...`
`......the Golden Land's...`
`k‐`
`......key.........!!"`
`Yes.`
` That is...the key to the Golden Land.`
` ......The key...to our childhood dreams.`
`......The only keyhole to stick that key in...is that place.`
`That...is definitely what offers the sacrifices.`
`You get it now...right...............?`
`"Uuu, ............uuuuUUUgghhHAAaaaaa...!!!"`
