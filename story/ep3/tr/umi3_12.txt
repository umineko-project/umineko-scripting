`Rosa returned to the lobby.`
`It was still her time to rest,`
` but her expression made it look as though she couldn't sleep deeply with all this tension.`
`"......You have to force yourself to lie down.`
` It'll get tough for you later on at this rate."`
`"Thanks for caring.`
` I just can't sleep.`
` ......I went and took a shower at least, so that will be enough.`
` The next person can rest."`
`"What about you two, Kyrie‐san? Rudolf‐san?"`
`"......What will we do, Rudolf‐san?`
` Will we rest?"`
`"You can rest if you want.`
` I'll stay awake.`
` That's the only manly thing I can do right now."`
`"Then I'll stay awake.`
` Staying awake with my husband is the only womanly thing I can do right now."`
`"......*giggle*.`
` You two truly are close."`
`"As are you two.`
` *giggle*."`
`"It seems that Eva and Hideyoshi‐san are out cold.`
` It appears as though, unlike Rosa, they can't fight against their age."`
`As though in response to those words, the door to the hall clunked open.`
`Eva and Hideyoshi returned from the guest room.`
`"That's none of your business.`
` ...Oh, Rosa, are you still alright without sleeping?"`
`"What about you, Nee‐san.`
` Why not take it easy and rest?"`
`"............I just can't get to sleep.`
` After taking a shower, my drowsiness faded away.`
` Rudolf, Kyrie‐san, you can rest if you want."`
`"Yeah, thanks.`
` For now the sentiment alone is enough.`
` Why don't you go first, Aniki?"`
`"How kind of you.`
` But I cannot rest first.`
` That is the most I can do as the oldest brother."`
`"Do not worry, the two of us will be awake until the very end."`
`"......*giggle*.`
` .........More importantly, Eva nee‐san,`
` are you alright?`
` You look a little pale."`
`"......Come to think of it, you're right.`
` ......Hmmm?`
` You're feelin' a bit hot, you know?"`
`Hideyoshi put his hand up against Eva's forehead.`
`{n}...It seemed that Eva wasn't feeling her best.`
`"Told you so.`
` ...That's what happens when you break your daily cycle at your age.`
` ......Is it a cold?"`
`"...Natsuhi.`
` Could you call Doctor Nanjo down?"`
`"Y‐yes."`
`"...I'm fine, you don't have to make such a big deal out of it.`
` I have some medicine, so I'll be fine.`
` ......I tend to get a fever when I'm tired.`
` Don't worry."`
`"......Nee‐san, take it easy, okay?"`
`".........Thank you.`
` ...When my siblings gather without me around, I get the feeling everyone is talking behind my back.`
` ...It's a persecution complex from long ago.`
` Sorry, okay?"`
`"...............I won't say anything.`
` I would never say something bad about you when you're away."`
`"......................................."`
`"......What is it?`
` Nee‐san, you've been acting strange for a while, you know?`
` Shouldn't you get a little rest now?"`
`"............You're right.`
` I started thinking about {i:raising money by March} and it made my headache even worse."`
`"That isn't good.`
` Rest.`
` ...I'll restrain myself so that your headache doesn't get worse.`
` I've had a bad headache myself for a while now."`
`".........Thank you.`
` ......Well then, I'll count on what you've said and rest for a while."`
`"What's up, Eva?`
` Why so bent out of shape all of a sudden?`
` ......Sorry 'bout this... Please let us rest a bit longer.`
` Sorry... Sorry..."`
`After putting his hands together as though praying and apologizing several times,`
` Hideyoshi went after Eva, and left the lobby.`
`"............I don't like this atmosphere.`
` Everything's so strained."`
`"That's no surprise.`
` ......There was a murder early this morning.`
` And since then, we've been eating canned food and holding guns.`
` ...It's natural that we would start to build up stress."`
`"I wonder if the kids up there have also built up stress.`
` ......I'm worried about Maria.`
` She tends to get irritable in times like this."`
`Just then, they heard the sound of wild footsteps from upstairs.`
` The guesthouse wasn't a cheap building, so if they had been any normal footsteps, there was no way they would have heard them.`
`It was like the sound of someone stamping their feet in frustration.`
`And not a moment later, in addition to the apparent sound of feet running out into the upstairs corridor,`
` they could hear Maria calling "uu‐uu‐uu" over and over again, sounding displeased.`
`Rosa grabbed her head, ruffled up her hair, and voicelessly moaned in anguish...`
`The adults conscientiously turned their backs to her, pretending not to notice.`
`The noisy clamor came downstairs and flew into the lobby.`
`It was Maria, who was sobbing; the other children, who had come down with her; and Nanjo.`
`...In other words, everyone on the second floor had come downstairs because of Maria's tantrum.`
`Rosa couldn't hide her dizziness at the scale of the annoyance her daughter was bringing to everyone...`
`"S‐sorry, Auntie Rosa...`
` We tried to calm her, but she just wouldn't listen..."`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"...What is it, Maria?`
` Could you be a little more quiet?`
` Everyone's looking."`
`"It's that rose of hers from the rose garden...`
` She suddenly started saying that she was worried about it."`
`"......I think she's half asleep.`
` She suddenly woke up, and started going on about how worried she was for that rose.`
` .........Maria‐chan, calm down.`
` That was just a dream..."`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` That was {f:5:Beatrice}'s and my rooose!!`
` So if I don't take care of it, {f:5:Beatrice} will get mad at meee!!`
` It might be broken again!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"......Haah...!`
` ...Listen, I'm {i:telling} you to quiet down a bit, {i:alright}?!?!"`
`The children were taken aback by the sudden rise in the tone of Rosa's voice.`
`But Maria's crying just grew louder, and her tantrum just grew fiercer.`
`"R‐...Rosa‐san.`
` You mustn't scold a child so bluntly without attending to what they say...`
` ...In times like this, it is good to give them some warm milk or something."`
`"......Is there any here?"`
`"The milk we served in place of breakfast earlier was the last..."`
`"Doesn't anyone have a sedative to use on kids...?`
` You know, those silver pill things?"`
`"Of course I do!!`
` Yes, I'll search for them now and make her take them!!"`
`Without hiding her displeasure, Rosa grabbed her handbag that she had placed on the sofa and fished around for the medicine.`
` ......It seemed that she had brought some child‐use sedatives for Maria's tantrums.`
`She found it and tipped the bottle into her palm, but it seemed to be empty.`
`{n}Irritated, Rosa shook the bottle several times, but that didn't change the fact that nothing was in there.`
`...All the while, Maria's crying was growing more and more intense...`
`Meanwhile, Eva was lying in bed, covered by the bedding.`
`Hideyoshi returned from the washroom, folding a handkerchief soaked in water.`
`"......My, this is one nasty fever...`
` ......I'm sure it's the poisonous air at this family conference that got you...`
` ......For now, you can forget all about the other relatives.`
` ...Alright?"`
`As Hideyoshi spoke to her kindly, he set the soaked handkerchief gently on Eva's burning forehead.`
`Eva rested her own hand on top of his.`
`".........Your hand...`
`feels wonderfully cool."`
`"If my hand feels wonderful, your fever must be pretty bad.`
` No worries, the medicine will start workin' soon.`
` Plus, my hand is a magic hand.`
` If I just put my hand up against your forehead like this, see,`
` any fever will melt right away."`
`"You're right.`
` ......Your hand always makes my fevers fade..."`
`"Yep.`
` No need for a doctor when you've got my hand.`
` Don't worry and close your eyes.`
` ......The fever will fade right away thanks to my magic..."`
`"Yes, I know...`
` ......I can feel your magic."`
`Hideyoshi was about to say "they call that the placebo effect", but he stopped.`
`......If Eva said that she could feel magic from his hand, then that was alright for now...`
`"............I wonder if magic really exists."`
`"Yeah.`
` Sure does.`
` Only those who believe can tell, though.`
` ...There's actually a lot of magic like that out there in the world."`
`"...If magic is real, ......then I wonder if witches are real too."`
`"Oh?`
` You mean that witch of the forest, {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` She probably does exist for those who believe.`
` Just like God.`
` Won't show himself except in front of those who strongly believe."`
`"...............You know,`
` ...long ago, I was able to use magic too."`
`"Oh?`
` That so?`
` Then you've been a witch once too."`
`"......You know, whenever I had a dream that I wanted to come true no matter what,`
` if I wished strongly and tried hard, it came true every time.`
` ......With my magic, my grades were always the best, and I even became the student council president, and got into the university I wanted by my own ability.`
` ......Everything I wished for was granted."`
`"That's right.`
` Your magic was always a thing to be reckoned with...`
` You're definitely a witch.`
` ...And you work harder than anyone.`
` ......I know aaall about it."`
`"...............You know,`
` ever since I was a kid, the whole time, there's been another me inside myself, who always supported me.`
` ...And that other self was a witch."`
`".........I didn't believe in {f:5:Beatrice}, the witch of the forest.`
` I always believed that if a witch of Rokkenjima did exist, it was the witch inside my heart.`
` .........I am so grateful to that witch inside myself.`
` ...I'm always so grateful......that she let me meet up with you..."`
`"............You're always too timid when you get sick.`
` ...Don't say anythin' for now.`
` ......I'll stay like this the whole time, until your fever has gone down, okay?"`
`"......Yeah.`
` ......No matter what,`
` ......don't take your hand away.`
` .........Somehow, I...`
`...feel like I'm becoming something that isn't myself,`
` ......and it's been scaring me for a while now.`
` ...I get the feeling that the witch inside of me...`
`...was provoked by {f:5:Beatrice}, and is growing stronger and stronger.`
` ...Somehow, it feels like she's going to swallow me up."`
`"It's alright.`
` As long as I'm with you, there's not a thiiing to be afraid of!`
` Remember the time we went to that dangerous country and the whole bus was robbed?`
` I repelled 'em!"`
`"...Honey, you just handed over your gold watch and begged them to go away.`
` ......It was pretty lame, ...but it was cool..."`
`"............This hand...`
` ...Please don't move it away, no matter what...`
` ......Not even if I fall asleep.`
` ......And even if something creepy sneaks inside,`
` ...protect me..."`
`"Yep, leave it to me.`
` ......So stop worryin' now and get some sleep.`
` The medicine and my magic will start workin' real soon..."`
`Eva finally calmed her heart and closed her eyes.`
`......Just then, there was the sound of a door being opened violently from the direction of the lobby.`
`It seemed that Maria was having a tantrum, and screams of "uu‐uu" could be heard,`
` along with Rosa's rebuking yells.`
`...That was probably very annoying to listen to.`
`{n}Or maybe it was taking a toll on her headache.`
`{n}Eva moaned as though in pain, and buried herself in the covers.`
`It was easy to guess what was happening.`
` Maria had probably had a tantrum for some reason, gone down to the lobby,`
` and when Rosa had scolded her for it, they had started arguing.`
`...And then, the looks of the rest of the family had been too much to bear, so Rosa had taken Maria out into the corridor.`
`......Hideyoshi had no desire to interfere with Rosa and Maria's problems.`
` ...But just for now, since Eva's condition was so bad, he wanted them to take their ruckus somewhere else.`
`"...Wait just a second.`
` I'll go ask them to keep it down."`
`".........C‐come back quickly..."`
`"Don't worry, I won't leave this room."`
`Hideyoshi removed the chain, opened the door, and stuck his face out into the corridor.`
` He immediately met Rosa's gaze.`
`"...Everythin' alright, Rosa‐san?"`
`"I'm sorry, did all this noise wake you up...?"`
`"Uu‐uu!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`"...Maria‐chan, sorry.`
` Auntie Eva isn't feelin' well, and she's tryin' to sleep.`
` Could you quiet down a smidgen...?"`
`Maria's tone didn't change after being asked by Hideyoshi.`
`She kept whining and repeating "My rose, my rose".`
`Rosa slapped Maria's cheek, lifted her up while covering her mouth,`
` and carried her off towards the entrance, trying to at least put some distance between her and Hideyoshi's room.`
`...They would still probably be clamorous for a while yet, but he had at least warned her.`
`{n}Hoping that Rosa would show her capabilities as a mother, Hideyoshi closed the door.`
`".........Is Maria‐chan crying again?"`
`"Looks like it.`
` ...It's tough for Rosa‐san too.`
` ......When you think about that, our George is almost too good to be true.`
` We should be grateful."`
`"...............You're right.`
` .........nn,`
` ......hand."`
`"Oh, sorry, sorry.`
` ......Here you go, it's the magic hand."`
`He put his hand on Eva's forehead again.`
`......Maybe there really was magical power in that hand.`
`A truly peaceful look rose to Eva's face, and bit by bit, she began to drift off into the land of sleep.`
`As he had promised, Hideyoshi kept his hand on her forehead......`
`By the entrance, with her hand still against Maria's mouth, Rosa was at a loss at what to do next.`
`She had been unable to withstand everyone's gaze in the lobby,`
` and had yelled at the children to go upstairs, before dashing out of the lobby.`
`And when she went out into the corridor, Hideyoshi had told her that she was being too noisy.`
`Where should I go now?`
` ......Where should I take this child who's having a tantrum?`
`She felt as though she was about to cry in frustration...`
`As Maria kept struggling in an attempt to scream, Rosa put her mouth up to Maria's ear,`
` and tried to persuade Maria in as calm a voice as she could manage.`
`".........Maria, you really want to see the rose that much...?"`
`Maria nodded her head several times, moaning "uu‐uu".`
`"...Why do you want to see the rose that much?`
` I'll listen to you, so will you tell me quietly?`
` I'll hit you if you scream."`
`"............My rose...`
` {f:5:Beatrice} revived it.`
` ......It might have broken again...`
` ...I'm worried about that...`
` Can't sleep until I make sure..."`
`It seemed that she was still making a fuss about that marked rose from yesterday.`
`Rosa felt her headache throbbing again,`
` but she was at least a little relieved that Maria had now stopped her screaming.`
`"Anyway, everyone is having a hard time right now.`
` So don't bother Mama and everyone else.`
` ......You can worry about that rose all you want tomorrow, when it stops raining.`
` So just listen to me for now...!"`
`"No.`
` ...No no no no.`
` My {f:5:Beatrice}'s rose...`
` ...Uuuu..., uu‐uu.`
` WaaaaaaAAaaaahh!!"`
`Rosa reflexively covered Maria's mouth.`
` She had spoken a little too harshly, and had gotten her agitated again...`
`Rosa realized that it was partly her own fault and clicked her tongue in self‐hatred.`
`But Maria thought that was directed at her, and her crying grew even fiercer...`
`"...I'm begging you, be quiet...`
` What can I do to make you stop crying?`
` What should I do to make you listen to what your Mama says?"`
`"........."`
`Abruptly.`
` Maria stopped crying unnaturally fast.`
`{n}......Then she turned around, and muttered.`
`"............`
`If I can see my rose, I'll be quiet until tomorrow."`
`"Really?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ...If we go to the rose garden and see my rose, I'll behave."`
`".................."`
`"I mean it, Mama."`
`"...................................."`
`If it would keep Maria quiet for the time being,`
` Rosa thought that even going out into this wind and rain would be a small price to pay.`
`She did think it might be a bit reckless.`
`{n}............But in the end, no murder or anything of the sort had actually occurred.`
`All of that clamor since this morning had been a farce set up by Kinzo.`
`If you carefully thought about that chain of locked rooms, it communicated more clearly than anything that it was all an act by the victims themselves...`
`"......Will you really listen if you get to see the rose?"`
`"Yeah.`
` I mean it, Mama.`
` ......Kihihi."`
`"................................."`
`"Ouch."`
`Rosa didn't overlook that creepy laugh, and lightly hit Maria with her fist.`
`{n}And she shrugged, as though giving up.`
`"......Fine.`
` You have one look and be satisfied.`
` Understand?"`
`"Yes, Mama.`
` I promise.`
` ......Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi."`
`Once again, Rosa tested the weight of her gun.`
`......It's alright.`
` It's only a farce.`
`{n}There was never a murderer on this island in the first place...`
`"Damn it, wait, Auntie Rosa...!!`
` Are Auntie Rosa and Maria......the sacrifices for the second twilight?!`
` Damn it damn it damn it, someone, notice them, tell them to stop!!`
` What are those guys in the living room and us kids doing?!!"`
`"Hmm.`
` They are being considerate of Rosa's pitiful relationship with her daughter, and are forcibly changing the subject.`
` The group you are in went upstairs, and are talking about something else while watching TV."`
`"Goddammit!!`
` Someone, notice them!`
` Who's the closest, is it Uncle Hideyoshi?!`
` Please, notice that those two are leaving through the front door, aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaahhh!!"`
`"It won't reach, it won't reach, *cackle*!`
` Don't disturb their precious time together.`
` Fuhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!"`
`Hideyoshi kept talking kindly, his hand on Eva's forehead.`
`He didn't notice that Rosa and Maria were going outside through the front door at all.`
`In that case, there was no way that the others in the lobby, which was even further away, would notice either.`
` And the cousins' room upstairs was even worse...!`
`"Why are you so panicked?`
` On the first twilight, didn't you defeat me with that bold move, saying that the culprit died in an accident on the first twilight?"`
`"...Doesn't that mean that there is no longer a culprit on this island...?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*, what is there to be so worried about...?"`
`"Shut up, I can see right through you!!`
` Someone stop them, those two'll be killed!!`
` Someone, stop theee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeem, aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaahhh!!"`
`......There was no way that Battler's voiceless scream would reach Rosa or Maria.`
`The two of them could be seen in the rose garden.`
`The rain was still awful, but fortunately, the wind had died down a little.`
`......No, maybe that wasn't fortunate.`
` Because if the wind {i:had} been a little fiercer, Rosa would surely have hesitated to go outside...`
`"......Uu, uu, uu...`
` ............Here it is...!"`
`Maria found her own rose with the gold lace and stared at it lovingly.`
`Rosa had accepted with the promise that Maria would only have one look at it,`
` but she didn't want Maria to complain that it hadn't been enough later on,`
` so she decided to go along with her until she was satisfied.`
`......She believed that there wasn't a culprit,`
` but if by any chance she was mistaken, they were now in an extremely dangerous position.`
`Rosa realized that faintly herself.`
`If things got bad, she would throw away her umbrella and ready her gun.`
`{n}...Keeping the innocently rejoicing Maria in the corner of her eye, Rosa gazed warily in all directions.`
`....................................?`
`{n}......Were her eyes just tired?`
`Even though no one should have been there, she thought she saw something glitter in the dark rose garden with all its wind and rain.`
`...Gold‐colored......?`
`{n}It had to be her imagination.`
`Because, to Rosa, it seemed as though gold butterflies were dancing through the rose bushes...`
`"......Are you alright, Eva...?`
` ...Just take it easy...and should I call Doctor Nanjo after all...?!"`
`"I...... ......I'm alright...`
` ......Don't take your hand away......`
` ...I'm begging you, ......don't take your hand away......"`
`Eva was breathing wildly.`
` Beads of sweat were appearing on her forehead.`
`It certainly was true that she had stayed up all night last night, and that things had been rough since early this morning.`
`{n}It wasn't odd that her body wasn't keeping up.`
`......Even though he understood that,`
` Hideyoshi suspected that Eva's sudden fever was the sign of some serious illness.`
`Several times, Hideyoshi suggested to call Doctor Nanjo, but Eva resisted firmly,`
` ...pleading with him and saying that it was even more important that he didn't take his hand away...`
`"I understand...`
` But you've gotta have Doctor Nanjo look at you by lunchtime.`
` If you can promise me that, I'll stay here the whole time, grippin' your hand.`
` Tightly, like this."`
`"......Thank you...`
` ......I'm fine...`
` The magic of your hand......will definitely make this fever subside......"`
`Even as she said that, Eva's harsh breathing didn't improve in the slightest.`
`"......Haah,`
` ......haah,`
` ......haahh...`
` ......Don't let go,`
` ...don't let go......`
`haah,`
` ......haahh,`
` ............aaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaaahhhh!!"`
`"Wh‐............who's there...?!"`
`She saw an umbrella moving from beyond the rose bush.`
`Rosa threw away her umbrella and wildly lifted her gun...`
`When she did, the figure beyond the bush......showed itself.`
`".........Uu?`
` ......Auntie Eva............`
` .........?"`
`"...You scared me.`
` So it was you, Nee‐san?`
` ............Do you have some business?`
` ...Do you want to continue our earlier discussion?"`
`"..............................`
` ...Yes, that's right.`
` Our discussion about Father's gold."`
`"......Please, restrain yourself in front of Maria.`
` I've been keeping my promise, okay?`
` I won't get in the way of your scheming."`
`"...............Scheming?`
` What's that?"`
`".........Whatever you're thinking, that's up to you.`
` I have no desire to get in the way.`
` So please, not in front of Maria.`
` As long as I get my share, that will be enough."`
`"Your share?`
` Heheheheh, ahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha."`
`Eva started laughing in a creepy voice...`
`{n}Rosa was startled, but Maria stared blankly.`
`.........Then Maria said just one thing.`
`".........Uu......?`
` ............Wait,`
` ............who are you...?"`
`"Hahahahahaha, ahhahhahahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!`
` Your shaaare?!`
` Who would give that to you...?!`
` All of that is mine!`
` It all belongs to me, the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}...!!!"`
`"UaaaAAAAAAAAaaaAaaaaaa—!!"`
`"Eva! Are you alright, Eva?!`
` Eva!`
` Eva!!"`
`"Hold on...!!`
` Don't let go!!`
` So that I don't get taken away by someone who isn't me...!!`
` Keep holding on to my hand...`
` Don't let gooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooooo...!!!"`
`"When did you ever work hard?!`
` You never worked hard for anything!`
` You were always hiding in our shadows!`
` You always ran about from shadow to shadow without fighting,`
` and yet, you really think yourself qualified to ask me for the Ushiromiya family gold...?!"`
`"All of that is mine!`
` It's all mine and mine alone, as the head of the Ushiromiya family and the new Golden Witch, successor to the name of {f:5:Beatrice}!!"`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...............It's {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` Mama, {f:5:Beatrice}!"`
`Frolicking around, Maria jumped at her mother in ecstasy.`
`{n}...Rosa treated Maria coldheartedly and raised her gun high.`
`"......Y‐......you're Nee‐san, right......?`
` ......You are Nee‐san, right......?"`
`"Wrong.`
` ...I am no longer the one who was your sister."`
`"Then who are you?!!`
` Are you going to say that you're {f:5:Beatrice}?!`
` That's impossible!`
` You died 19 years ago!!!"`
`"Yes, you were definitely dead, after all, I clearly saw that your head was smashed.`
` I can remember your insides flowing out like it was yesterday!`
` How could you be alive and right here noooooooooow?!?!"`
`"The concept of death does not exist for a Golden Witch.`
` The names of the Golden Witch and {f:5:Beatrice} will be handed down for all eternity."`
`"Maybe the {f:5:Beatrice} you knew met with death, but that name is mine now...!`
` Therefore it is endless!`
` The concept of death does not exist for {f:5:Beatrice}!!"`
`"......How pitiful, Nee‐san...!"`
`.........That gold has caused you to lose the distinction between fantasy and reality......`
`"I said I'm not your sister anymore.`
` ......Well then, as the new {f:5:Beatrice}, I have been tasked with my own resurrection ritual.`
` .........Ronove!`
` What should I do?!"`
`"That is up to you.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, you already have the power to make whatever you think reality.`
` You should grow used to it if you use it a little."`
`"......You worthless former sister.`
` You should consider it an honor to have been selected as my first sacrifice as a witch.`
` On the second twilight, I'll tear apart the two who are close, with my own hands...!!"`
`The first thing the new {f:5:Beatrice} wished,`
` ......no, the first magic she tried to use, was to surpass the limitations given to humans.`
`...In particular, gravity.`
`She wanted to become fully aware of her transformation into a witch by being released from those shackles.`
`As the witch and Rosa stayed as they were...`
`......The ground retreated all by itself, into the distance below them.`
`{n}By now, their feet were no longer attached to the ground.`
`Rosa finally realized that the ground hadn't retreated into the distance below her,`
` but that she and the witch had been sucked up into the rainy sky.`
`"............huh...?`
` ...............Eeeek...?!"`
`"Wh‐.........whoooooooooaaaa...... Awesome......!"`
`To humans, shackled by gravity, there is nothing more unnerving than not having their feet on solid earth.`
`......However, to {f:5:Beatrice}, who had learned the joy of being released from gravity as a new witch,`
` it was enough to cause her whole body to shake with delight.`
`"......Hey, Rosa.`
` Do you remember, long ago, when we were small, when we used to talk about what it'd be like to become witches and fly around the sky?`
` ......It's come true, you know?`
` I became a real witch and granted it for you."`
`"S‐............Stop it, .........wake me from this dream......"`
`"You said it.`
` You said that you flew through the sky in your dream.`
` And you also said that you hadn't wanted to wake up.`
` You were even mad at me for waking you, right?"`
`"......Don't worry.`
` You won't wake up this time, alright?`
` Heheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheheh!!"`
`Come, dance with me in the vast, rainy sky.`
`Didn't we wish together to fly like seagulls in the sky,`
` and escape the cramped and boring island of Rokkenjima...?`
`Now, I'll make that dream a reality for you.`
`That is why I want to share this joy with you, and no one else...!`
`"Ahhahaha ahhahahahaha!!`
` Isn't this so fun, Rosa, isn't this so fun?!!`
`"`
`"Take a look, below you!`
` Look at how small our mansion is.`
` I wonder how much time we spent in a place that small.`
` ...Now I'm especially shocked at how cramped and tiny it is."`
`"So feel.`
` Enjoy.`
` Rejoice...!`
` That power we yearned for, the power to move through the sky at will!`
` Come on, let's dance, Rosa!`
` Through the rain, through the wind!`
` Let's fly around like we're dancing!`
` The lightning will shine on us and bless us!!`
` Ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`The witch and Rosa were like leaves fluttering around in a whirlwind.`
`{n}As the rain pounded upon every part of their bodies, as the lightning occasionally shone upon them, they shook with the joy of being released from the ground.`
`...However, it was only that way for the witch.`
`{n}Rosa was holding onto her head, voicelessly screaming over and over.`
`"Stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiitt!!`
` Please no mooo{-}o{-}o{-}ooore, let me dooo{-}o{-}o{-}ooown!!"`
`"......You're right, it's more fitting for {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s to crawl on the ground.`
` Then why not go back there?"`
`A slightly displeased expression rose to the witch's face when she realized that her own joy was not being shared.`
` And she decided to listen to her former sister's request.`
`"............?!`
` .........aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaAAA{0}A{0}A{0}AAHHHHH!!"`
`The whirlwind that had been making Rosa dance around grew weaker, then stopped.`
`In other words, Rosa was once again bound by the restrictions of gravity, as a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
`......Following the laws that were originally correct, Rosa began to descend towards the ground upside‐down.`
` No, she began to fall.`
`"Oops...`
` That's right, if I don't take her down the right way, this is what happens!"`
`The witch hadn't intended to send Rosa plummeting.`
`{n}But she still wasn't used to using magic.`
`After plummeting about 100 meters into a rose bush,`
` as a very, very natural result, Rosa died instantly.`
`But the witch hadn't intended to kill her.`
`{n}So she willed for Rosa not to die.`
`When she did, gold butterflies coiled about Rosa's body, reviving that life just as the witch had wished.`
`Rosa's body, which had laid out a radial carpet of fresh blood, rapidly returned to normal.`
`The broken and crushed bones returned to normal.`
`The torn and smashed flesh returned to normal.`
`......How easy it is to break things in this world, and how difficult it is to fix them...`
`Anyone can take a life.`
`But no {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} can revive a lost life!`
` By surpassing the irreversible, one proves that they have surpassed {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.`
`......This surely gave her a much, much greater realization that she was a witch than flying through the sky had.`
`".........Awesome...`
` I can even revive......an ended life......!"`
`"Of course.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, you are already an Endless Witch."`
`"......To live and to die.`
` To bring to life and to kill, all of it repeated endlessly.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, as the Endless Witch, you are the queen who controls that cycle of life and death."`
`"Ahaha, aha.`
` One time, I dropped a goldfish bowl.`
` The fragile and beautiful bowl broke, and I couldn't put it back together again.`
` That cute pop‐eyed goldfish would never swim for me again after it landed on the floor."`
`".........No matter how much I cried, the servants shook their heads, saying that broken things and dead things could never be revived."`
`"...That's when I learned, you know?`
` You mustn't break things, you mustn't kill people.`
` After all, you can't fix them!!"`
`"So...if you {i:could} fix them...`
`...then you wouldn't get in trouble for breaking them, right...?`
` Haha, ahahahaha, .........awesome...`
` Awesome, awesome, awesome...!!`
` Ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaah{0}hahah{0}hahhah{0}hahhaha!!"`
`For a while, the witch became intoxicated with how terrible and wonderful the power she had succeeded was.`
`Her laugh was pure, innocent, and also cruel.`
`".........Uuuuuunnghh, ......au......"`
`Even though Rosa had been revived, she let out a cry of anguish at the pain from her fall.`
` The witch landed in front of her and held out her hand.`
`"Hahahahahahaha, sorry about that, Rosa.`
` I didn't think flying in the sky would be so much fun.`
` Sorry, I'm really sorry."`
`"And I didn't know that {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s could die so easily.`
` But I've brought you back to life, so you're fine now.`
` So get up, okay?`
` Play with me some more, okay?`
` *giggle*giggle*, ehehehaaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`What were those dreams you told me about when you were a kid...?`
` Go ahead and tell me about all of them without holding back.`
`As I am now, I can make anything come true, no matter how absurd...!`
`I can let you drown in a ocean of jelly!`
`{n}I can swallow you up in a mountain of cake!`
`{n}I can even make you grow butterfly wings and let you fly around the garden!`
`I'll do them one after another, let's start with the ocean of jelly, okay...?!`
`"S‐stop,`
` ...............urgg!!"`
`Rosa was once again thrown high into the rainy sky.`
` However, the sky wasn't filled with raindrops, but with drops of orange juice.`
`When she looked down, Rosa had to doubt her eyes.`
` The rose garden had disappeared, and the ground spread out beneath her was like a pastel‐colored jigsaw puzzle.`
`......It was from the dream she had talked about when she was young, an ocean of jelly.`
`The black part was coffee jelly.`
` The red was strawberry,`
` the yellow was pineapple,`
` the green was melon.`
`What was the white part, apple, perhaps...?`
`.........Did Rosa even have the time to think something like that?`
`Rosa fell towards that multi‐colored ocean.`
`......And sank deep into a grape‐flavored purple sea.`
`It really was an ocean of jelly.`
` It had no bottom.`
`As Rosa sank, she was shocked to see a school of transparent fish swimming through the grape jelly ocean.`
`They were probably made of grape skin.`
`Then she sank on and on, deeper and deeper, as deep as the Mariana Trench,`
` ......compressed tight by the water pressure of the jelly ocean,`
` as her ribs crushed and crunched, as her spine snapped and cracked.`
`...In the end, she had become a small, frail meatball.`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahaha!`
` What a truly wonderful experience, to drown to death in an ocean of jelly...!!`
` It's a dream no one else can imitate!!`
` I granted it for you, ahhyahyahyahya!!"`
`The instant I snapped my fingers, the meatball that had been Rosa was launched up into the sky.`
`And after being enveloped in a golden brilliance, she returned to her original form.`
`It was as simple and easy as returning dried seaweed to its original form, and anyone could do it.`
` If they were a witch!`
`That vacant look on Rosa's face...`
`had to be because of the joy from having that dream she had given up on as a child made into reality.`
` Definitely. Probably.`
`Next is the mountain of cake.`
`{n}In an instant, the sky was covered, and became patterned black and white like a chessboard.`
`That almost transparent white part was her favorite gelatin cheesecake.`
`{n}The elegant black part was a slightly bitter gâteau au chocolat.`
`They were a ceiling, they were a mountain, ......and those several billion cakes were thrown down towards Rosa.`
`If you piled those cakes up, they would surely be taller than Everest.`
`So they probably weighed...`
`......I'm not too sure, but it was probably heavier than all the cakes across Japan put together.`
`It fell down like a ceiling and swallowed Rosa up,`
` ......so as a very, very natural result, Rosa was crushed to death.`
`In less than a second,`
` her bones broke throughout her body and her insides were all smashed and forced out,`
` spladdasplutslop.`
`And yet still an even greater number of cakes piled up on top,`
` ...and Rosa ended up as a layer of jam wedged between the cakes.`
`She became as thin as a single hair, and was probably smashed out into the area of a tennis court.`
`That world swallowed up by cake was once again absorbed by a golden flash.`
`Then, as though it had all been a dream, Rosa was revived once again.`
`......Of course, it definitely wasn't a dream.`
`{n}She had been revived after dying.`
`By that point, death, which most {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s only have to experience once after they are born,`
` had already been experienced repeatedly by Rosa.`
`In other words, she had gone through that which {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s cannot, the precious experience of dying more than once.`
`"Ahhahahahahahahaha, kyahha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!`
` Isn't this fun, Rosa, isn't this fun?!`
` Next is the butterflies, look...!!"`
`"P‐please, have mercy...... .........aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"No waaay!`
` Let's play more, let's play more...!!`
` Kyahihihiha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`Laughing innocently, she pointed her gold staff at Rosa as she begged for mercy.`
`When she did, Rosa glittered gold and rapidly began to shrink.`
`She shrank down to the size of a real butterfly.`
` Then, gold wings sprouted from her back...and she joined her fellow gold butterflies.`
`However, while a human body could withstand this wind, it was a different matter for a butterfly's body.`
`The gold butterfly Rosa was invited to dance by each gale of wind, and she spun in circles around the rose garden.`
`"No, ...nooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooOO{-}O{-}OOoo{-}o{-}ooOO{-}OOooo!!`
` .........ah—"`
`A gentle bed caught her as she tired from dancing.`
`It was a soft, knit hammock in the shadows beneath the roof of the arbor.`
`...The owner of that hammock lumbered into view, welcoming its rare guest who had wandered in on this stormy night...`
`That owner, which should have been small enough to crush in the palm of your hand,`
` now looked as big as the top of a canopy bed to Rosa.`
`"Giiyaaaaaaaaaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaaa!!!"`
`"Kyahhahaha{0}kya{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!`
` What a klutz, you got caught in a spider's web!`
` Ahhahaha, ahhahahahahaha!!"`
`"This time, it's a dance with a spider.`
` That takes me back, remember the times we'd find a spider's web and play around by throwing pebbles at it?`
` I've heard that spiders don't chew their prey,`
` but insert their venom, and when the insides melt into a sticky soup, they suck it out."`
`"......Hey, Rosa, remember?`
` Remember how we'd throw butterflies into the spider's web on purpose, and play around by seeing how the spider would attack?"`
`"Kyahhahahahahahaha,`
` you don't remember, do you? This happened before you got into grade school...!!`
` You'll be able to see it up close this time, you know!`
` Very close.`
` Kyahihi{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}kyaaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo,`
` have mercy, Nee‐san,`
` help me, Nee‐san!!`
`"`
`"Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii`
`gaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh`
`gigyeeehhh`
`gpgyaagh`
`wagaghhggggg`
`ergorblahgehmolgeeaarggaagagaga—`
`ga—`
`...ga—`
`......gyuboh!!"`
`"This girl's not bad. She truly can use magic at will!`
` Hiihyahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hakkuhi{0}hie{0}hie{0}hya{0}hyahya!!"`
`"Interesting interesting, interesting interesting!`
` You feel like laughing too, right, Battleeeeeeer?!"`
`"Stop this bullshit!!!`
` Just STOOOOOOP!!!`
` What's so fun, you're insane, you're insane!!`
` What's so fun about doing something like this?!?!"`
`"Doesn't she look like she's having so much fun?`
` I don't blame her, magic {i:is} fun!!`
` I remember, when I first became able to use magic, I played around so much!`
` ...Yeess, I understand, I understand, I understand that play from the bottom of my heart!"`
`"......I expect I won't be able to share this joy and passion with you, Battler, aah, what a shame, what a shame!!`
` If you accepted me, I'd teach you magic anytime you wanted, you know?!`
` It's hard to describe the joy you receive in the instant you are freed from the shackles of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}ity!"`
`"I want to teach you about it, that joy, that passion!`
` I definitely would like to see the world of magic you would give birth to, just once!`
` Kihhihihihi, hhyahhya{0}haah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"You're starting to enjoy yourself, right?`
` You've started wanting to use magic, right?!`
` It's pretty fun to be a witch, you know?!`
` Just for you, I'll teach everything!`
` About the joy of flying together in the sky, about the joy of diving together through the sea!"`
`"I will teach you the excitement that you feel,`
` in the instant you surpass the bounds of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s and see how wide your world stretches!`
` Wouldn't that be fun,`
` wahhyahhyaha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`There was no malice in Beato's expression.`
`...It was hard to believe, but she was genuinely enjoying this cruel show.`
`And she thought she was sharing her appreciation with Battler.`
`{n}......Battler was aghast at that vastly...`
`hopelessly different measure of value.`
`"This is unbelievable... There's definitely something screwed up with you!!`
` Stop it already, goddammiiiiiiiiit!!`
` {f:5:Virgilia}, make her stop this insane farce!!`
` What do I have to do?!!"`
`".........We exist outside the board.`
` We cannot touch the board itself."`
`{f:5:Virgilia} shook her head apologetically.`
`{n}...She was one who had already been "killed".`
`{n}Did that mean she couldn't interfere in any way...?`
`As Beato continued to enjoy it in a crazed sort of way, Battler lifted her up by the collar and yelled at her.`
`"Stop it stop it stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!!`
` That's {i:enough}, you goddamn witch!!`
` Are you trying to tell me that's Auntie Eva?!"`
`"That's impossible!!`
` While the Auntie Eva I know may be a bit mean at times,`
` it's completely impossible that she's the kind of person that would do something this cruel!!"`
`"This is all part of your deception!!`
` Don't toy with Auntie Rosa!!`
` Don't toy with Auntie Eva!!`
` Stop this farce RIGHT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!"`
`"But I already said that it's not me playing with Rosa anymore.`
` I told you, that's the new {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"Is it really so cruel that you have to squeal like that?`
` You're also pretty fond of stuff like this, aren't you?!`
` You actually have just a bit of interest in magic and—`
`...ouch.`
` Wh‐what was that—"`
`For the first time, Battler slapped Beato across the cheek.`
`...Beato didn't know why something like that would be done to her, and a stunned expression rose to her face.`
`Battler found that expression even more unforgivable, and he roared.`
`"HUUUUUUH?!`
` You call this {i:interesting}?!`
` What the shit is wrong with your head?!!`
` Go kill yourself!`
` Slice the top of your head off and try looking inside, you'll definitely find that the insides have been completely removed!!!"`
`"Make her stop it right now, make her stop this disgusting farce!!`
` I'll never forgive you!!`
` How dare you do something so cruel!!`
` I've sometimes thought that you're a bit of a funny person, but I'll never make that mistake again!"`
`"You're just a monster who's nothing but cruel!!!`
` Don't show yourself in front of me!!`
` Never again!!`
` I won't accept you, I won't talk with you, I don't even want to look at your face!!"`
`"That get through to you?!!`
` Don't show yourself in front of me!!`
` Just—FUCK—OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOFF!!!"`
`The instant Battler screamed, the power that resisted the witch became a red wall which repelled Beato, knocking her back onto her butt.`
`"......Owowowow...`
` ...What are you talking about, isn't it an interesting show...?"`
`She spoke as though making an excuse, but the person those words were directed at, Battler, was no longer there.`
` His figure had suddenly disappeared into the darkness...`
`...But Beato pouted her lips, and continued trying to explain herself.`
`"......I‐it's not like I completely don't see where you're coming from,`
` ...but this is nothing more than an innocent prank, right...?`
` No matter how she kills, that person will be brought back to life in the end, right?`
` ...Aren't {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s creatures that are fine with anything as long as it ends well......?!"`
`"R‐right, Master?`
` It's not something to get so angry about...!"`
`She was hoping for approval, but {f:5:Virgilia} simply faced her with an indifferent expression.`
`{n}...To Beato, at that moment, even an exasperated face would probably have seemed better.`
`"............I have nothing in particular to say.`
` If you think it is fun, you can keep watching as long as you want.`
` ...Call me when it's over.`
` I will erase my form until then."`
`Following Battler's lead, {f:5:Virgilia} hid herself in the darkness...`
`Left sitting there on her own, Beato didn't have a clue what was going on, and felt like she had been made out to be the bad guy.`
`"..............................`
` ......What's so wronnng?`
` It's an interesting show, isn't it...?!`
` I‐it might be a little vulgar, ......but it's fairly interesting, isn't it...?!!`
` Right, Ronove...?!`
` It's nothing to get so mad about, right...?!"`
`"Pu ku ku ku.`
` ......Something interesting for you, Milady, is not necessarily interesting for Battler‐sama."`
`"Does he really...hate me that much?"`
`"......Well, certainly, we are playing against each other, so it is true we are enemies,`
` ...but is our relationship really so bad that we can't laugh together at entertainment...?!`
` .........Since I applauded together with Battler, I thought I could at least laugh together with him...`
` ......Does he really reject me so much that we can't even do that...?"`
`"...He doesn't have to accept that I'm a witch.`
` Because the point of the game is to compete over that.`
` But still, saying he won't look at my face, that he won't talk to me,`
` ......surely ignoring me is going too far...`
` Am I really hated that muuuuuch......!"`
`"The moves you have made thus far are certainly worthy of hatred, Milady.`
` Even a demon such as myself can slightly understand Battler‐sama's feelings.`
` ......I wonder if you cannot understand that because you are especially thickheaded, Milady?`
` Pukkukukukuku."`
`"Sh‐shut up shut up shut up shut up!!`
` Why don't you disappear too?!!"`
`"Yes, certainly.`
` ......Then, if you would excuse me."`
`Even Ronove hid himself in the darkness, and Beato was left alone.`
`The only one in the rainy rose garden.`
`No one will play with a lonely witch.`
`Because no one would play with her, she was a lonely witch.`
`".....................`
` ......What's going on?`
` ...Why won't anyone play with me...?`
` .........Am I really that weird, that cruel...?`
` ............Someone, answer meeeeeeeeee!!"`
`"Kyahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha, isn't this fun, Rosa, isn't this fun!`
` Hey, how should we play next?`
` Of course, I'll play with Maria too, okay?"`
`"Let's all have a friendly walk together!`
` Let's swim in a pot of boiling chocolate, let's have a picnic in a cake‐rising oven!`
` Ahahaha, akya{0}kya{0}kya{0}kya{0}kyakya!!"`
`".........H‐hey, new {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`Behind the witch who was continuing her spree of tragedy, Beato showed herself.`
`...Her expression was very rare for her.`
` It was kind of restrained, somehow unreliable, miserable.`
`"Oh, it's the predecessor {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` Were you watching?"`
`"The power of magic is truly wonderful!`
` Until now, I had never thought it would be so fun to be reborn as a witch.`
` It's like playtime that never ends...!`
` Come on, let's play together, Predecessor‐sama...!!"`
`"But first, wait for a second, okay?!`
` The two of them were cooked to death in the oven, so I have to revive them again!"`
`"They're like bread rising because of yeast!`
` Like cookies expanding in an oven!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"L‐Listen to what I'm saying..."`
`"......Umm, well.`
` Isn't that enough for the sacrifices of the second twilight?`
` ...Of course, it isn't specified how you kill them, but,`
` umm,`
` ......maybe you shouldn't toy with them any more than that..."`
`"What are you saying, Predecessor‐sama?`
` I heard from Ronove a short while ago.`
` That your magic was much, much more wonderful, cruel, and self‐indulgent!"`
`"A Halloween party where candies poured out of six people's stomachs, how truly wonderful!`
` As for me, maybe I'll act out Alice's tea party...!`
` I'll invite everyone to a tea party to celebrate a happy unbirthday, and entertain them one by one with my magic!"`
`"I wonder if I can do it as wonderfully as you?`
` I wonder if I can be cruel in my own pop, cute style?!"`
`"Now that I think about it, all fairy tales are cruel, aren't they?`
` Now that I'm a witch inside one of those fairy tales, I finally understand.`
` Kyahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}kukyahya{0}fuhyaha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"...............I, I am, umm,`
` ...slightly of the opinion that, in the past,`
` ...I, too, might have gone a little too far.`
` ......Well, I think that as the Golden Witch, it's a good idea to have a little elegance..."`
`"..................???`
` I don't understand what you're saying, Predecessor‐sama."`
`"But there's one thing I do understand.`
` No matter how hard I try now, I'm no match for how cruel you are.`
` I've gotta try much, much harder.`
` I've gotta become more cruel, and become an excellent Golden Witch...!"`
`"L‐like I said, you've already done enough here...!`
` A‐anyway, this is my order, as your predecessor.`
` That's enough for the second twilight.`
` I'll show you how it's done.`
` Stand back and watch..."`
`"Yes, Predecessor‐sama.`
` I can't wait to see what brutal, cruel, and disgusting method of killing you'll use."`
`The new witch pinched the sides of her skirt and gave a graceful bow,`
` stepping back as an expectant gaze rose to her face.`
`......She was expecting an even more cruel magic that surpassed even herself.`
`"............Well, speaking of that...`
` You're only half a witch if you can only kill with methods like that.`
` ...I shall show you an elegant way to kill, worthy of the Golden Witch..."`
`When Beato waved her pipe, seven colors of smoke poured out, reviving Rosa and Maria.`
`......Compared to how the new {f:5:Beatrice} had done it a short while ago, it was slightly gentler.`
` ...It was probably gentler than how Beato had done it herself up until now.`
`Rosa's consciousness had already grown dim from the pain of so many repeated deaths.`
`...But even so, she pleaded that her daughter be spared...`
`"......Please......have mercy......`
` ...Even......if it's just Maria......have mercy......"`
`"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, Mama, Mamaaaaaa!!"`
`".........Sorry.`
` My disciple just, umm, ...acted without restraint for a bit.`
` ...Umm,`
` .........forgive me."`
`"B‐{f:5:Beatriceeeeeeeeeeeee}!!`
` Waaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaahh, waaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaahh!!"`
`When Maria realized it was the real {f:5:Beatrice}, she jumped onto her.`
`"...You promised, right, Beato?!`
` You promised that you would take me to the Golden Land, right?!`
` There I can be friends with Mama, and everyone will laugh together...!`
` You promised that you would take us there, right?!"`
`".........A‐`
`...about that.`
` ...I can no longer...`
`keep that promise.`
` .........Because someone appeared who could solve the riddle,`
` ......I am no longer the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......So, I'm sorry.`
` ...I can no longer keep my promise with you......"`
`"Why...?`
` Why...?`
` Beato, you promised..."`
`"......I'm sorry.`
` ...I'm truly sorry...`
` .........So at least, in apology for not being able to keep my promise..."`
`............I'll give you a truly quiet sleep,`
`{n}which will never be disrupted again...`
`Beato embraced Maria with a loving expression...`
`Then, .........softly, a red bruise appeared on Maria's neck.`
`{n}It was a very gentle bruise.`
`...It grew redder and redder, ...and when it distinctly formed itself into the shape of a hand...`
`......Maria's neck tilted suddenly.`
`{n}...Peacefully, as though she had fallen asleep.`
`"M‐Maria......`
` ...MariaaaAAaaaAAAAAaa!!"`
`"......Sorry.`
` ......I won't apologize that you were the sacrifices for the second twilight.`
` That is simply your fate."`
`"However, I must apologize for the vulgar way in which you were offered as sacrifices...`
` ......This is your final sleep.`
` ...Never again will it be disturbed..."`
`Beato softly, gently lifted her finger, as though touching the empty air in front of her nose.`
`...When she did, a light breeze lifted up, making Rosa's body dance lightly like a feather.`
`Then, Rosa's body floated lightly,`
` ......and there was the garden fence, with its spear‐shaped prongs.`
`The spear of the fence pierced Rosa's medulla oblongata.`
`......Benevolently, without toying with her, in a single blow.`
`{n}Rosa's life was snuffed out.`
`Compared to the earlier innocent yet cruel events, her end was surprisingly tame.`
`...It just looked like a doll shaped like Rosa was leaning against the fence.`
`...But, she had passed away.`
`".........W‐...well, that's pretty much how you do it."`
`Beato acted proud, but the new witch wore a blank expression, almost as though this was an anticlimax.`
` And she was forthright with that opinion.`
`"It's kinda plain...`
` ......Very different from the person Ronove told me about."`
`"...Well, um, ...you must use magic with dignity, you see...?`
` If it's too, umm, ...undignified, that isn't very elegant..."`
`".............................................`
` ......But you can do wonderful things endlessly with this magic.`
` ......How boring."`
`"Now now! No complaining...!`
` The path of a Golden Witch cannot be completed in a day.`
` You are still incomplete until you finish the tenth twilight...`
` For now, stay quiet and follow my instructions.`
` ...Alright......?!"`
`"......................................."`
`"Wh‐what happened to your answer?`
` Your answer...!"`
`"...........................`
` ...............Fiiine."`
`"...Better, much better.`
` ......Well, there is still much to do for the resurrection ritual.`
` You still have to kill five people...`
` You should do it without toying with them too much, with beauty and dignity,`
` ...and with at least a little decorum, alright...?"`
`"What Ronove told you about how I did it, ......that was a bad example.`
` You mustn't use that as a model.`
` Engrave that into your heart."`
`"............Yes, Predecessor‐sama."`
`"A good answer.`
` ......Ronove, the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, arise...!"`
`"......Yes, Milady.`
` Ronove, right here."`
`"Lucifer the Proud, right here."`
`"...Up until this point, umm, I've done things a little flashy, but,`
` ......umm,`
` ......well, the dignity of the Golden Witch is also important,`
` so, what I'm trying to say is—"`
`As Ronove chuckled at Beato's uncharacteristically flustered speech,`
` he summed it up for her.`
`"Certainly.`
` From now on, we will be careful to perform in a graceful manner, suitable for the name of the Golden Witch.`
` ......Even the Seven Sisters of Purgatory will reform their previous bad behavior,`
` and we shall espouse to perform our task in the quickest possible manner.`
` ......Would that be acceptable? Milady?"`
`"M‐mm.`
` That's it, more or less.`
` Everyone, take it to heart!`
` Alright...?!"`
`"Yes.`
` Certainly."`
`"That is all I wish to say.`
` ......You may leave now."`
`"Certainly.`
` If you would excuse me."`
`"Excuse us."`
`".........................................."`
`"Well, ...that's all I want to say.`
` So, take care as you continue, alright?`
` Go with dignity, and, ...umm, decorum, befitting the Golden Witch, alright?`
` ......You should do your best.`
` I will be watching over you."`
`Acting unsure until the very end, Beato communicated only that to her,`
` became a group of gold butterflies, and vanished into thin air.`
` It may be fitting to say that she disappeared in a hurry because she was having trouble maintaining the conversation.`
`After that, all that remained was Maria's outstretched body, pounded by the rain,`
` and Rosa's body, propped up by the fence and gazing up at the sky.`
`......And the figure of the witch.`
`".....................Show some decorum............you say."`
`Her expression looked just a little bored.`
`There was a popping sound.`
`{n}...That was probably her clicking her tongue.`
`".................................`
` ...........................What a boring person."`
`Leaving that last sentence behind, she, too, vanished into thin air......`
