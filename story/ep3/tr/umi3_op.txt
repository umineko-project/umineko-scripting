`The vase was very, very beautiful, rich with history and value.`
`Even as young as I was, it still forced me to take a deep breath when I witnessed its beauty.`
`Of course, it was one of Grandfather's favorite collection pieces.`
`So that I didn't accidentally destroy its fragile beauty,`
` I was always strictly ordered never to touch it.`
`......But that just made me want to touch it.`
`You could almost see right through it, and yet it was so elegant; it appeared so weightless, and yet it had an indescribable presence.`
`...I wanted to see what it felt like to touch a vase like that.`
`However, ...just as Grandfather had said, it was something that must not be touched.`
`This much beauty arises precisely because it must never be touched.`
`It was a beauty that could only dwell in something so fragile it would break at a touch.`
`Which is exactly why, if it were to be touched by my impudent finger, it would oh so easily—`
`Just like an enjoyable morning dream fading into nothing as you wake...`
`......it vanished, fell, and broke into smithereens.`
`I realized that, because of my own foolish curiosity, I had done something that couldn't be taken back.`
`No matter how much I regretted it, no matter how much I apologized.`
`{n}The broken vase would not return to its original form...`
`I would probably be scolded by Grandfather.`
`{n}Probably very harshly.`
`Frightened, I ended up breaking into tears and sobbing...`
`As I did, I noticed something............beautiful.`
` Lightly dancing golden butterflies...`
`were coming towards me.`
`The beautiful butterflies began to gather, one at a time, glittering fantastically with glowing golden powder.`
`Oh, it's {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}That reliable Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice} had arrived.`
`The butterflies gathered one after another, grouped together, and there, became her form...`
`She was always on my side.`
`{n}Whenever I was in trouble, she would always appear and help me.`
`"Good day to you, princess."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}!`
` ......uuuughu, hic, hic...!"`
`"Oh, my...`
` Why are you crying so on a day so perfect for a tea party, my princess...?"`
`"...I broke Grandfather's precious vase...`
` Uugh... Grandfather will get mad at me.`
` ...I don't know what I should do...`
` hic..."`
`"That is indeed worrying.`
` I believe the Master greatly treasured this particular vase.`
` ......Hohohoho, it's terrifying even for me to think about what kind of punishment you'll receive."`
`Grandfather was a very frightening person.`
`And once he told you something, if you failed to follow it, he would become mad with a rage that would make even the fallen angels in hell quiver.`
`I was intimately familiar with that, which is why I couldn't do anything but shake like this and cry...`
`"I hold no magic to scoop up your fallen tears, princess,`
` but if you want magic that will make it possible for you to avoid being scolded by the Master, I might be able to do something."`
`"R‐really...?"`
`"If you will believe in my power, princess.`
` The basis of magic power is the power of belief.`
` ......Miracles will only appear before those who strongly believe."`
`"I, ...I believe...`
` I believe in your magic, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` So please fix this vase.`
` Please...!"`
`"If that is what you want, princess.`
` ......Very well, then leave it to me."`
`When she extended her index finger, a golden butterfly softly landed there, and changed its form into her favorite magic wand.`
`Even that was enough to give me a small glimpse at {f:5:Beatrice}'s wonderful and great magic power.`
`She pointed her wand at the broken vase, and, just like a child's lullaby, she began speaking the magic words...`
`"Come, try closing your eyes.`
` And try to remember.`
` What form did you have?`
` It was surely a very, very beautiful form.`
` Please, show me that form one more time..."`
`Were they words, or was it a song?`
`No, it was surely magic.`
`After all, can't you see? ...The pieces of the vase are gathering together in no time at all,`
` ...and softly returning to the place where they had been displayed, ......returning to their original beautiful form.`
`"......Incredible..."`
`"See?`
` Now it's back to normal.`
` This way, you will be able to avoid being yelled at by the Master."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}, you sure are incredible.`
` It was no trouble for you to repair a broken vase."`
`"That's not true.`
` Returning something broken to its original form is a very, very difficult thing.`
` With my magic, I could do no more than make it remember what it was, for the time being."`
`"......?`
` But, the vase really turned back to the way it was, right...?"`
`"That's right.`
` But that doesn't mean that I caused the vase to avoid its fate of being broken.`
` I did nothing but make the broken vase remember how it was before it broke for the time being.`
` Magic power that can repair a broken fate to its original form is at a very high level that even I have yet to reach."`
`At that time, the high‐pitched scream of a servant could be heard from inside the mansion.`
`When I went to see what had happened,`
` ......I noticed that several of the servants had gathered, and were cleaning up the remains of the broken vase.`
`From what they said, it seemed that a black cat had sneaked in from somewhere, climbed up on the vase, and toppled it over.`
`I understood the meaning of what {f:5:Beatrice} had said.`
`...At the time that I broke the vase, "the vase had been broken".`
`{f:5:Beatrice} had shown me that the vase had been restored, but that had been a temporary thing.`
` It didn't mean the fate that "the vase had been broken" had changed.`
`As a result, ......the vase had remembered its true fate, and "broke".`
`{n}But I hadn't broken it; instead, it had been a cat which had snuck in...`
`That's right.`
` {f:5:Beatrice} hadn't said "Let's mend the vase".`
`She had said she would make it so that I didn't have to be punished.`
`The fate of the vase breaking hadn't changed, but the fact that I had broken it certainly had...`
`{f:5:Beatrice} had skillfully saved me from danger with that magic...`
`"It is very easy to break something.`
` Just like how you, princess, did not require magic in order to break the vase."`
`"...Fixing something is very hard...?"`
`"Yes.`
` So much so that you were at a loss at what to do and started crying."`
`"......So it's easier to use magic to do horrible things?`
` To break,`
` ......to kill is very easy,`
` ......but fixing and reviving things is very hard, as you say..."`
`"......That's right.`
` With magic, it is much easier to do things like breaking and killing.`
` Therefore, weak witches who lose to temptation become intoxicated with that power which they can easily obtain, and neglect their real magic training."`
`"......Real magic is the power to repair, to revive.`
` To call back happiness which has disappeared, to call back love which has gotten cold.`
` And it can call back a forgotten smile to a princess's face."`
`"Then, ......{f:5:Beatrice}, does that mean that since you could fix the vase, you are an incredible witch?"`
`"My days of training are far from over.`
` After all, I couldn't make the vase forget its fate for even an hour.`
` If it had been my master, who taught me magic,`
` I'm sure that she would have been able to restore the vase to its original form forever."`
`"If it broke and broke, she could fix it over and over again...?"`
`"Yes.`
` When one reaches that level, they are possessed of endless magical power.`
` That is the endless level that all witches should strive to reach.`
` As a sign of the highest respect to those witches, we call them..."`
`"An Endless Witch..."`
`"That's right.`
` ......To witches holding the power to mend something endlessly, the concept of breaking doesn't even exist.`
` They are released from all of the sadness caused by losing things and are promised eternal bliss."`
`Certainly, the human world is full of sadness caused by separation and loss.`
`To escape that sadness, people pray to God, and ask for the power to withstand the sadness, believing it to be a test...`
`In other words, a human's life is a journey, searching for a way to withstand sadness.`
`In that case, a witch who could revive all things would be freed from all sadness in the world.`
` ......In other words, it is eternal bliss...`
`"I wonder......if I could become a witch like you, and gain eternal happiness."`
`"You, princess...?`
` Hoh‐hoh‐ho... That would be a long, long, difficult path, you know?"`
`"I want to be a witch.`
` ......I want to be happy.`
` I want to be your disciple."`
`"...............`
` Do you have even the slightest doubt in that feeling?"`
`"No.`
` I want to become a witch too."`
`"......All right.`
` Then, until you get tired of it, princess, I will allow you to be my disciple.`
` ...Will you call me Master?"`
`"Yes, Master."`
`"That's a good answer.`
` Then from now on, learn the depths of magic along with me.`
` I am also in training.`
` Let us both learn magic the right way, and do our best to reach that blissful level."`
`"Yes, Master...!"`
`"........................`
` ...Ah, a dream.`
` ......That face brings me back..."`
`Endless Witch, was it?`
`A name that I had yearned for in the past as the highest achievement...now just another one of my titles.`
`No, you can even call it a name.`
`"...Every once in a while, it's nice to feel some satisfaction from that name.`
` Isn't it something that I gained as the result of many days of training?"`
`"...It's a little bit of a waste if I don't feel some gratitude for it every once in a while.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`I shook my head lightly.`
`If it is called the highest level, that means that there is nothing higher.`
`{n}An eternal dead end, the beginning of eternal boredom.`
`"Master said it once.`
` That when one is released from all sadness, it is the same as eternal bliss.`
` ......Which is why I think...`
`Master {i:couldn't reach that level}."`
`Eternal bliss means eternal boredom.`
`{n}...That's the beginning of eternal torture.`
`But perhaps all things depend on your point of view.`
`Eternal boredom is the same as a sketchbook that doesn't run out of pages.`
` It means you can draw whatever you want, can put in as much effort to enjoy it as you want.`
`Boredom is the worst poison that kills all witches.`
`......To the Great Witches who hold the title "Lady", this is frighteningly true.`
`{n}It is the eternal poison that tortures them because of the eternal bliss that they have reached...`
`"Now that I have earned the name of Endless Witch, I truly wish to speak with my master again.`
` ......Was the result of our training really "happiness"?`
` And I want to talk with her about what true "happiness" is."`
`― Training has no end.`
` When you think you have reached the eternal level, that is the time to regret your immaturity.`
`......As if in answer to my own words, a memory of her saying something like that entered my mind.`
`"*cackle*cackle*, hahhahahahahahahahaha...`
` I see, ......I am immature, am I?!`
` How nice, how nice.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`Some painfully shrill laughter could be heard.`
`It was from my furniture.`
` ...Did they break their toy again?`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐samaaa.`
` This guy's stopped moving agaaain."`
`"Even though I haven't played enough at all.`
` What a pathetic man."`
`"I hadn't even played at alllll!`
` Let me play, let me playyyy!"`
`"Be silent, you filth!`
` No matter how well {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama fixes him, he just breaks right away, because you all devour him like starving dogs."`
`"You broke him the most, Satan‐nee.`
` 'Cause you don't know restraint."`
`"My apologies, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` Please forgive my cretinous younger sisters."`
`"Fix him quicklyyy!`
` I'm next, I'm neeext!"`
`"Can you not be silent, shut up!!"`
`"""""""Eeek!!"""""""`
`Just from that single yell, the noisy Sisters of the Seven Stakes disappeared and hid.`
`They just mess around, having as much fun as they want breaking him.`
`{n}They only come to me to clean up afterwards.`
`{n}...Good grief, my furniture doesn't let me get bored.`
`What remained after the pieces of furniture hid themselves...was just the sloppy mess that was all that remained of the broken toy.`
`It had no form anymore.`
`"...Even I find it hard to recall his original form when he looks like this.`
` It's better to make him remember for himself.`
` ......Oh, well."`
`I waved my golden pipe.`
`And I told.`
` I chanted.`
` I made it remember.`
`"......Come, try to remember.`
` What form did you have?`
` ...After all, right now, you look like nothing but a huge lump of scrap meat to me."`
`"I've no idea which parts are the arms and which parts are the legs.`
` If you don't remember for me, I won't even be able to recall your face.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`By the power of the magic, the pitiful pieces of meat began to remember what their form had been.`
`Who was connected to who.`
` Where was joined up with where.`
`That's right, just like that.`
`...No, no, you should be a finger on the left hand.`
` And you, the right hand.`
` That's it, good, good, *cackle*.`
`"...Good morning.`
` Feeling awake, Ushiromiya Battler?`
` How truly ironic that being awake is even more like a nightmare."`
`".........*cough*, ...*cough*...`
` .........eck, ...owowow......"`
`"If you would just accept that I am a witch, you'll quickly awaken from this nightmare, and I'll send you to heaven.`
` I am the king of Mount Purgatory.`
` There's no way out of this hell without my approval."`
`"Heh, ...heheheheh.`
` You call this hell? That's no good.`
` Yeah, that's no goddamn good at all."`
`"The pain of death, which humans only have to taste once,`
` has been given to you more times than I could count with all of my fingers, and yet, ...how can you keep talking like that?`
` *cackle*!`
` That is why I never tire.`
` I never tire of you."`
`"Yeah, I'm not tiring either.`
` I mean, I get to pick and choose from those busty babes with dazzling asses in my harem.`
` Thanks to that, I'm not getting tired at all."`
`"*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` I am glad to hear it.`
` Otherwise I too would be bored.`
` So, my furniture.`
` I've fixed him, so you can play as much as you want."`
`"Thank you very much!`
` Kyaha, dibs!"`
`"Didn't I say you're done, you're done, I'm next!`
` Back off, waaah!"`
`"Huhuhuhuhu.`
` Wonderful, isn't it, Battler‐kuuun?`
` You're so popular, aren't you?"`
`"It's hard being a popular guy.`
` Get in line, you beasts."`
`"If you stopped acting all tough and started being honest with yourself, this would be much easier on you."`
`"It's alright like this.`
` His screams feel so much better this way."`
`"Alright, let's not break him easily this time.`
` Well?! Do you hear me?!"`
`"You aren't in control!"`
`"So, Battler‐kun.`
` Let's continue where we left off, alright?`
` After locking Jessica‐chan's room with the master key, how did they return the key to the pocket of the corpse which was inside the room?"`
`"......For example...`
` ...That's it, they used a fishing line or something, and just the key went back into the room through the crack of the door..."`
`"Kyahhahahahahahaha!!`
` Wronnng!"`
`"So naive.`
` {p:1:Of all of the doors that exist on Rokkenjima, none has a crack through which a key can slip}."`
`"He got it wrong? He got it wrong?!`
` Right, this time me, my turn!`
` Wherrre should I strike!"`
`"Me, back of the hand!"`
`"Gh...!!"`
`"That's meeeean!`
` Then, the back of the other hand!"`
`"Gwoaaahhh...!!"`
`"I'll take the tip of the nose!"`
`"Ga...gagah......!!"`
`"Why, why, let me do it too, let me strike too!`
` Waaah!!"`
`"You're just slow, Levia‐nee, "you snooze you lose" has always been how we've done things!`
` Then, I'll take the top of his foot!"`
`"Ugwaahh......!!"`
`"Waaah!!`
` Me too, me toooo!`
` Fine, I don't care, I'll take his shoulder!"`
`"Ga...hahh......!!"`
`"Keh...`
` You're sisters, right? Be nice to each other. ...`
`...Gwaaa, ......oh, .........hh..."`
`"......How can you withstand that?`
` Why haven't you realized that your false courage actually makes us more excited?"`
`"Too bad.`
` False courage and being stubborn are my specialty.`
` No matter how you all try to speak in riddles, I definitely won't accept witches and magic...!"`
`"Even though you can't explain anything with human tricks?`
` Are you a moron?!`
` Know your place!"`
`"It's alright, we don't have to force him to accept it.`
` Any moment now he'll break down crying with the desire to accept it.`
` Even now, he really wants to kneel down on the ground pitifully and beg our forgiveness!"`
`"Ugaah, guahgehgehgyahh...!!"`
`"Aahhhh, he's broken already!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐samaaa!"`
`"......Dear me.`
` Since they know that I can revive him over and over, my pieces of furniture don't even hesitate to break him.`
` How troublesome."`
`Endless rebirths give me free reign over endless deaths, too.`
` Before the Endless Witch {f:5:Beatrice}, all death and life has no meaning.`
`Even death can't serve as the key to escape from my cage.`
`"So, Battler.`
` Remember your original form once more.`
` I'll toy with you over and over again!"`
`"I see, I see, it truly is pleasant to have a toy to play with for all eternity.`
` ......I see, could this be the endless bliss witches gain at the endless level?"`
`"I see, I see.`
` This certainly is a pleasant bliss.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Wahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` I'll revive you over and over, kill you over and over!"`
`"Now then, what kind of murder spree shall I unleash on the next game board?`
` Come, bring the new game board. Why don't we begin the next game, Ushiromiya Battler!!"`
