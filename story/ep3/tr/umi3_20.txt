`A monotonous electronic sound kept on repeating.`
`The theme of that room was a so‐called "hygienic" emotionless white.`
`{n}...It was a room of a certain university hospital.`
`An ordinary person wouldn't be able to afford the cost of even a single night in this room,`
` a room which neither her doctors, nor she herself, had any doubts would be the last she ever stayed in...`
`Was the person on the bed...`
`............Eva?`
`She looked haggard and aged, to the point that you would not believe it was her, unless you were told.`
`A well‐built man in a suit, waiting in the corner near the door, was having a conversation with the outside in a low voice, over the intercom.`
`...He was a guard protecting Eva's person.`
`After telling the person on the other end of the intercom to wait, he approached Eva's bed.`
`...Eva had been awake for a while.`
`......However, she stared at a single point in empty space, as though her mind was not in the same place.`
`"......Ange ({p:0:縁寿})‐san has arrived in the lobby below.`
` Should we let her pass?"`
`"................................."`
`For a long time, Eva didn't answer.`
`However, bit by bit, her eyes began to regain their focus, and she gave a small nod, indicating that she didn't mind if they called Ange.`
`...Eva herself had been the one to call her.`
` And she was right on time.`
`Eva now refused to meet anyone without an appointment made in advance.`
`The reason the room was dark, even though it was still light outside, was because the curtains were closed.`
`...There was always one guard waiting in the room, and three more waiting in the corridor and the lobby.`
`They were all there to protect Eva's person...`
`Eventually, there was the sound of a knock.`
`Also, there was a message from the intercom that the guest's body check had been completed with no problems.`
`The door was unlocked, then opened,`
` .........and a woman of about high‐school age was standing there.`
`"Chairman.`
` Ange‐san has arrived."`
`Eva reacted and turned her face towards the guest.`
`However, instead of reacting to the guard's call, maybe it would be better to say that she reacted to the smell of Ange's makeup.`
`......Having been shut up in this room for so long, Eva was sensitive to small changes in smell.`
`"........................`
` So you came.`
` ......Ange."`
`"......Yes, I did.`
` You did call me."`
`On Eva's face, you couldn't find the expression of one warmly welcoming their niece.`
`{n}...And on Ange's face, you couldn't see the expression of one pleased to see their aunt.`
`Eva waved her arm, which had grown as thin as a withered branch, and motioned for the guard to leave.`
`The guard bowed silently and went out into the hall.`
`"......It's not only stuffy, but dark too.`
` Why don't you have the curtains opened...?"`
`"...............And then the hitman you hired will shoot through the window, is that what you're planning......?"`
`".........If it came to that, I'd much rather be the one paid to do the hit.`
` All I'd have to do is relax at home for a month and the job would take care of itself."`
`"...Heheheheh, hahhahhahhahha......"`
`Their discussion was quite morbid for an aunt and niece.`
`...However, they didn't look like they were joking.`
`{n}......At the very least, Eva did believe that someone was after her life.`
`All of the Ushiromiya family's massive fortune had come into the possession of Ushiromiya Eva.`
`...It was said that this fortune also included the ten tons of hidden gold that Ushiromiya Kinzo was rumored to have kept concealed.`
`They could do nothing while this vast wealth was in the hands of the cunning, sly, and extremely suspicious Eva,`
` ......but it was rumored that if it passed on to Ange, who was no more than a young girl, certain people were plotting to snatch it away at once.`
`By now, Eva and Ange were Kinzo's only descendants.`
`{n}......If Eva died, all of the wealth would go to Ange.`
`...And if Ange were to be killed as well,`
` ......that wealth would go to the family of Ange's mother, Kyrie.`
`In this sense, not only Eva, but Ange as well,`
` ...was in a position where it wouldn't be odd at all for her life to be targeted by some unknown person.`
`......And Eva had hated Ange for a long time.`
`Because, after losing her precious only son George,`
` ......she had learned that the only one who had survived to inherit her own wealth...`
`was Ange, who had been absent from that family conference twelve years ago.`
`Eva shunned Ange, hated her, even detested her.`
`She isolated Ange in a special school, and separated her from the youth and happiness normal people have, trying to deprive her life of all opportunity.`
`......However, Eva had succumbed to an incurable illness,`
` and ironically, ...her remaining life was estimated to be the same as Kinzo's had been at that family conference twelve years earlier...`
`Both Eva and Ange...hated each other.`
`Even though they were each other's last blood relatives, ...they hated each other so much that they hoped the other would die quickly...`
`".........And?`
` Why did you go to all the trouble of calling for me...?"`
`"......I don't have much time left.`
` ......These quack doctors still have no idea what I was poisoned with.`
` .........But I know.`
` I'm sure it's that secret assassination drug, the one that foreign intelligence agency was using."`
`"...Ooh, I'm going to be killed, I'm going to be killed...!!`
` Aren't you lucky, very soon, I will die, and then you will be so relieved...!"`
`".................................`
` ...What a pitiable person."`
`This always happened.`
`{n}......She immediately deviated from the main topic, distorting it into a more unsettling discussion.`
`Eva, who was full of suspicion, believed that someone was always after her life.`
`Indeed, after inheriting the vast wealth of the Ushiromiya family,`
` she had used wild methods just like Kinzo had done in the past, and had repeatedly made money by any means necessary, creating many enemies along the way.`
`With a massive supply of capital, she had launched aggressive takeovers against businesses which were starting to have rapid growth,`
` making them buy it back at a high price under the guise of reconciliation.`
`......Ironically, it was the same type of action that her husband's company had been hit with twelve years ago...`
`She had repeated this constantly for the past twelve years.`
`{n}......She had also earned a lot of hatred.`
`If her husband had heard of this from beyond the grave, he might have defended her, saying that this was because of the loneliness from losing her family.`
`......However, no one who knew her now would come to her defense.`
`For some time, Eva waxed eloquent about exactly how her life was being targeted,`
` listing off names of people who likely held hatred for her,`
` and sneering at the fact that she still hadn't been killed.`
`Even when Ange heard her own name included in that list,`
` her expression did not change significantly, and she waited indifferently for Eva to tire herself out...`
`".........You know what?`
` ............I really hate...`
`you."`
`"I'm honored.`
` Same here."`
`".........I built this future for George's sake.`
` ......To think that it would be snatched away by you.`
` ...To think that it would be stolen by Rudolf's daughter...`
` .........I can't bear it.`
` ......To think that not only will I not leave a child,`
` ...but even my fortune will be stolen,`
` .........that, to me, is just...`
`...unforgivable............!"`
`"......In that case, why don't you give all of your fortune to charity?`
` What happened to all those religious people you've requested so many times?"`
`"............*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` They all say the same thing.`
` ...My excessive wealth has become a burden to me.`
` They always say something about how I need to give it up and cleanse myself.`
` ......Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!`
` And then the idea came to me.`
` To stop donating!"`
`For a time, Eva had invited in the founders of several strange new religious cults, perhaps looking for peace in her heart.`
`...But in the end, they did not give her heart any relief,`
` and only further increased her suspicion...`
`".........If you've got money to burn, why don't you start buying up thoroughbreds and make some corned beef?"`
`"I've thought of something even more interesting.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` I've racked my brains over it a lot.`
` What could I do to make things horrible for you?"`
`"......I thought about just killing you.`
` I also thought about erasing all of my wealth, leaving you penniless, and kicking you out of the Ushiromiya family or something."`
`"Wouldn't that be wonderful?`
` A lady brought up prim and proper, made to crawl around and prowl for moldy bread and muddy water.`
` Aaah, that too would be truly glorious,`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"............Having fun?"`
`"Oh, yes.`
` It's fun to scare you...`
` ......But very soon, I will die.`
` ...So I thought about how I can continue to cause you pain even after I die."`
`".........And then, ......*cackle*cackle*!`
` It was surprisingly simple.`
` ......I called you because I wanted to tell you about it."`
`".....................I have midterms coming up.`
` Keep it brief."`
`"...I have decided.`
` I will have you inherit all of my fortune."`
`".................................`
` ...Huh."`
`"Not only that,`
` ......I decided that until the very day that I die,`
` ...I'll increase that fortune as much as I can, inflate it to massive proportions and have you inherit all of it.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*, can you even imagine what that would be like...?"`
`"......No idea.`
` Because I'm stupid."`
`"Ehhehhehheh, *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` No, you wouldn't have any idea, would you...!`
` Look forward to it, it really is fun, being rich...!`
` Every day, from morning till night, monsters from across Japan will come to play."`
`"From now on, your entire private life will be followed by talk shows and weekly magazines.`
` The media criticize me no matter what I do or don't do!`
` If I donate, they'll attack me as a bourgeois, and if I begrudge them that money, I'll be abused as a miser."`
`"Oh, every day really is wonderful, you see?`
` I realized that I would love to invite you to that kind of life, when you are so young and have so much ahead of you.`
` Isn't that just to die for?"`
`".........The public is right in its criticism of all that you've done."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` Yes, yes, I'm sure that they are.`
` ...Go ahead, insult me as much as you want.`
` And then you will be burdened with that criticism."`
`"......Japanese culture says that good people live in honorable poverty, while the wealthy should die.`
` No matter what you do or do not do, you will eventually be held up as a symbol of envy and hate from across Japan."`
`"...*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` I wonder how twisted your life will become after living this way...?"`
`"You will have no allies!`
` No one will listen to your worries.`
` Insulting you will become a public sport.`
` And no one can stop that!"`
`"Oh, Ange!`
` Ehheheheheheh,`
` oh, I'm really looking forward to it.`
` ...I wonder how you will live your life, and how you'll end it...!`
` Relish your life of being unable to trust anyone in the world, love anyone, or talk with anyone...!!"`
`"I'll be patiently waiting for you in hell, waiting for you to come falling down, bringing that story of hardship with you.`
` Heheheheh,`
` ahahhahahahahahahaha,`
` waah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah,`
` ghhkk,`
` *cough*cough*,`
` ghah!!"`
`Her insane laughter turned into a painful cough.`
`Without changing her expression in the slightest, looking completely unconcerned,`
` ......Ange stared at the only survivor of Rokkenjima.`
`Perhaps because he found the violent coughing odd, the guard flew in as he gave a short knock on the door.`
`Ange glanced at him, wordlessly showing that she hadn't moved a step from where she had been.`
`......Ange was prepared for some kind of trap to frame her in Eva's death.`
` However, that was fortunately a needless anxiety.`
`As the guard rubbed Eva's back, he poured hot water from a thermos into a mug.`
`As he did, Eva kept coughing, looking like she was in pain.`
`Ange thought that this was probably the final form of the witch of Rokkenjima, and the last she would be able to see.`
`Eventually, Eva was able to moisten her throat and regain her normal breathing.`
`{n}...However, the glittering madness inside her eyes hadn't subsided in the slightest.`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` That cursed mass of gold and the inheritance of the Ushiromiya headship,`
` ......as well as...`
`.........the name of the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`are now yours.`
` ............Enjoy your insane, twisted life fitting for the name of the witch...!"`
`"I don't care about those.`
` Enough of that, just tell me this.`
` ......What happened on Rokkenjima that day?`
` .........I don't believe that there was an accident.`
` Tell me the truth about what happened that day, and why Mom and Dad and Nii‐san died......!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*...!`
` Oh, that must be the best way to harass you, mustn't it?`
` ......What happened on that day?`
` What happened on this very day in 1986...?`
` ......You want to know what they said before they died, ......don't youuuu...?"`
`"I woOOn't tell yooOOOoouu,`
` aaahh{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah!!`
` I'll leave behind the cursed gold!`
` But you know what? I'll take the truth you desire with me to hell...!`
` That's the best way I can harass you!!"`
`"Upset?`
` If you want to hear, try going to hell and asking your family there!`
` In that case, you better die right now, right?!`
` Ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha, why don't you just give up and die now and foreverrr?!`
` Waaahhah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"`
`That laugh continued until she started coughing again.`
`And that cough did not subside until she started moaning and going into convulsions......`
`October 4th, 1986.`
`On Rokkenjima, the Ushiromiya family's customary and final family conference was held.`
`And on the next day, October 5th...`
`an "extremely unfortunate accident" occurred, and the Ushiromiya family was wiped out.`
`"As good luck would have it", Ushiromiya Eva escaped from that,`
` and succeeded almost all of the Ushiromiya family's fortune.`
`However, due to the many turbulent rumors surrounding the Ushiromiya family, the way Eva acted afterwards,`
` and her unnatural actions at the time of the "unfortunate accident", there was public controversy over whether this might have been a plot to get all of the inheritance for herself.`
`Under pressure from the public, prosecutors attempted numerous investigations,`
` and the media began tracing the outline of the murder plot under the name of Rokkenjimagate,`
` but in the end, they were not able to find sufficient proof that this "unfortunate accident" was a crime.`
`However, because the media continued to give the impression that Rokkenjimagate was a murder plot by Eva,`
` public opinion began to believe that she was the true culprit.`
`...Of course, all that easily condemnable overbearing financial activity which she had carried out using that vast wealth...`
`left a bad impression that only made matters worse.`
`Every time she did something and the rumors started spreading, the talk shows would bring back Rokkenjimagate,`
` blaming the justice system by saying that she was the true culprit, and that the only reason that she hadn't been arrested was because even the police had been bribed.`
`And the impression that she was an evil criminal grew stronger and stronger...`
`Her heart eventually degenerated,`
` ...and ironically, it began to transfigure her into the kind of human that the public expected...`
`By now, Eva had no one she trusted, and no family.`
`......Her beloved husband, Hideyoshi, was already no more, and the talk shows would occasionally mention his company,`
` saying that it was run recklessly, while criticizing and disgracing its former accomplishments.`
`Even her beloved son, George,`
` was dramatized as the stereotypical "rich, lazy son" that the public expected,`
` ...and no one even attempted to find out what a simple and honest character he had possessed.`
`...As to how much all of this hurt Eva and ran her to ruin, ...no one was interested.`
`The public was only interested in the idea of an evil woman who had gone so far as to kill her whole family to become a multimillionaire,`
` and in what kind of pitiful final years she would lead.`
`So she changed more and more,`
` ...until eventually...`
`{n}...Eva's personality was transfigured to the point that she was treated as a lunatic......`
`It was said that she sometimes remembered that this was exactly the same way her father Kinzo, who she had once admired, had been in his later years,`
` and laughed at herself with scorn...`
`And, on the day of that final family conference...`
`Because Ushiromiya Rudolf's daughter, Ange, had been sick and had stayed with her mother's family, she had not participated.`
`At the age of six, she lost her family and gained Eva as her guardian.`
`Since Ange had become Eva's only blood relative,`
` Eva "took very good care of her".`
`She had imposing guards always surrounding Ange's person, to prevent her from coming to harm.`
`......Ange had even her right to play with friends, to come home from school together, and to enjoy the seasons together...stolen.`
`"So that she can live a full and pleasant school life",`
` Eva sent Ange to an elegant boarding school which took care of her every need, completely isolating her from the world.`
`She didn't even know the popular songs that girls her age might hum.`
`She was never once given a chance to enjoy window shopping with her friends, or stuff her mouth with crêpes,`
` ...much less an encounter with a member of the opposite sex to make her heart throb.`
`Ange did not have a single friend.`
` If anyone carelessly acted friendly with Ange, they would be scolded by the guards, or else the teachers.`
`......All of them were strictly ordered not to let the peasants approach the daughter of the esteemed Ushiromiya family.`
`During that time, the talk shows were always talking about Ushiromiya Eva, and always spreading rumors about her many financial evil deeds.`
`......Those who found out that she was her "daughter" naturally began to keep their distance.`
`...Even now, she was called a witch at school, and any time something adverse happened,`
` it was baselessly whispered as truth that the school was operating according to her wishes, and that she had something to do with it.`
`The environment makes the person.`
`{n}By now, she had a heart as hardened as those around her feared.`
`...She trusted no one, and didn't even try.`
`{n}She loved no one, and didn't even try.`
`And on top of all of this, when Eva caught an incurable illness,`
` it was whispered that this too had been planned, and this time, Ange was set up as the mastermind...`
`Everyone whispered that the daughter of a witch was a witch.`
`{n}Even the talk shows and the weekly magazines whispered that.`
`...So Ange, too,`
` because of that,`
` no,`
` as though it might as well be true, accepted it.`
`Therefore, since she already believed that she was a witch,`
` when she heard that the name of the Golden Witch was being turned over to her, she felt nothing if not completely unfazed.`
`However, she was at least sure of one thing.`
`This title of witch that she had inherited would definitely never be inherited by anyone else.`
`She would be the last head of the Ushiromiya family, and the last, isolated, Golden Witch......`
`Ange could be seen on the roof of a skyscraper.`
`Compared to the winds of the world which had beaten down upon her until now, this strong, cold wind was warm and pleasant.`
`Below her lay a beautiful nighttime scene, and a dazzling river of red and white lights.`
`It was a clear sky tonight.`
` ...So there really should have been countless stars stretching out over the sky.`
` ...However, the light from the ground was so bright, you couldn't see them at all.`
`...Ange couldn't help but think that what she really sought lay somewhere in that unseen starlight.`
`The world of reality below her looked so far away from here.`
`...This place felt to her as the closest to the world she should really be in.`
`............There was only one thing that Ange cursed:`
`Why had I not been able to go to that family conference, on that day twelve years ago?`
`If I had gone, I would probably have been able to be with my family forever.`
`...Recently, ...I've been having a dream about my family, over and over again.`
`My self of twelve years ago calls out frantically, urging them not to go to the family conference.`
`But both Mom and Dad are too far away, and my hand won't reach them.`
`I reach for the hand of Battler nii‐san, who always really loved me—for the hand that would always pat my head—`
` .........but even though it looks like it's so close to reaching, even that falls short.`
`For some reason, I started having that dream over and over again.`
`......Whenever I have that dream,`
` I repeat my useless effort inside the dream, trying to stretch out my hand even more forcefully.`
`If only Battler nii‐san at least could have lived...`
`.........then perhaps, at least the two of us could have supported each other through life in this cold and lonely reality.`
`But his hand never reaches me.`
`So even if I climb to the roof of a building as tall as this one,`
` ......I am distantly separated from all of them.`
`......A mysterious girl appears in my dreams and urges me.`
`That girl in my dreams urges me to arrive at the truth of what happened twelve years ago.`
`"........................`
` ......If I could learn...`
`what happened to Dad and everyone else on that day,`
` ............would they come back?`
` At least one of them...!"`
`There was no way...`
`...that anyone existed who could answer those words.`
`I understand.`
` .........In this world, I have no family, no friends, no one.`
`So,`
` ............let's go.`
` ...Let's go home.`
`{n}......To where my family is.`
`From the beginning, ...Ange's figure had been on the far side of the fence.`
`The scenery below her eyes was distant, beautiful, and so fantastical that it did not give rise to the slightest bit of fear.`
`If I face down, I'll surely be taken to the world below.`
`......So I faced up.`
`Because I wanted to be taken to the world above, the world where my family was.`
`.........Who cares about vast wealth.`
` Who cares about cursed gold.`
`{n}Who cares about the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`What I really want...isn't something that even a mountain of gold will help me obtain...`
`What I need for that...is just the small amount of courage...to take a single step forward.`
`............Just then,`
` ...I definitely heard a voice.`
`{n}I knew that voice.`
`The voice that had always......called to me in my dreams...`
`Before my eyes, ......in other words, in mid‐air above that jet‐black nighttime scenery...`
`......There was the figure of that girl I had seen in my dreams...`
`She spoke again, with the same voice I had heard inside my dreams.`
`".........Your assistance is needed."`
`"...My...`
`.........assistance......?`
` Who needs it......?"`
`".........Your family needs it.`
` ...Your family is eternally imprisoned in the two‐day span that began on this day twelve years ago."`
`"I‐...if I save them,`
` ......does that mean my family will come back?!"`
`When I asked the question I most wanted to ask, the girl cruelly stopped talking and hung her head.`
`"......I cannot promise that.`
` The enemy is the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...A mighty opponent.`
` I cannot compete with her.`
` ......But another Golden Witch might be able to manage something."`
`"............I, I don't know...what you're talking about."`
`"......The only one who can oppose the {f:5:Beatrice} of 1986...`
`is the final {f:5:Beatrice}, of 1998.`
` .........In other words, you.`
` Ange.`
` .........{f:5:Ange Beatrice}."`
`"That witch from twelve years ago...`
`...took away my family.........?"`
`"Yes.`
` She is responsible for what happened to your family.`
` ............The source that always leads to your future of isolation."`
`"........................`
` ......My...`
`...family's...`
`......killer."`
`"......In exchange, I will search for the fragment with the ideal world that you wish for, the world where your family comes home.`
` .........But I can't promise you that your desire will be granted.`
` ...The game board of the 1986 {f:5:Beatrice} is quite perfect."`
`"......I had planned on bringing you that ideal fragment as a present today, but I still can't find it.`
` ............It's a very firm fate.`
` I haven't seen the likes of it since I fought with {f:5:Lambdadelta}."`
`".............................................`
` I,`
` ......I don't know...`
`...what you're talking about."`
`".........I'm giving you a chance for revenge.`
` ...In exchange, I promise to find and bring you the happiest resolution that it is possible for you to receive."`
`"..............................Revenge......"`
`"......It may be a fruitless effort.`
` Even if you succeed in your revenge, there's no definite proof that your family will return.`
` Even with a miraculous probability, you may only be able to bring one person back."`
`...Ange now understood the meaning of that dream.`
`......That dream where it seemed that, with just a little bit more, her hand might at least be able to reach Battler nii‐san.`
`"A miraculous probability......is still higher than zero, right...?`
` Is it about one percent...?"`
`"......All probability values are powerless before the result.`
` So I cannot tell you that number."`
`"But unlike if I don't do anything, there definitely is a small possibility."`
`"Yes.`
` As long as you do not throw your hope away.`
` ...But prepare yourself.`
` It is extremely close to zero."`
`"..................`
` Alright.`
` I'm in."`
`"......Are you sure?`
` You'll probably never be able to come back here again."`
`"This is not the world where I belong.`
` ......And...as for the world where I do belong...I'll find it myself.`
` Tell me your name."`
`"The Witch of Miracles, {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` And by that name,`
` I acknowledge you as the Golden Witch, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}.`
` ......As of now, you are a true witch."`
`The instant she proclaimed that I was a witch...`
`...I felt dizzy, as though something inside me had changed drastically.`
`Just then, I heard a slam.`
`{n}...It was the sound of the door connecting the staircase to the roof being opened.`
`There were Aunt Eva's guards.`
`...“Guards” only in name.{n}Aren't they the cage that's closest to me, shutting me in?`
`They saw that I was already on the other side of the fence and dashed forward, horrified.`
`"20, target found.`
` Requesting assistance on the roof."`
`"Ange‐san...!`
` We were looking for you!`
` It's dangerous there, so quickly, come this way!"`
`".........What's that?"`
`"......My fan club.`
` ...I'm pretty popular."`
`"No point in getting caught.`
` .........Let's go."`
`Looking annoyed, {f:5:Bernkastel} turned on her heels.`
` ...In the jet black sky.`
`Watching that perfectly casual gesture, I followed her as though it was completely normal.`
`"Ange‐san!!!`
` Wait!`
` Don't be hasty, look ooooooooooouuuut!!"`
`"Oh, it's no good, it's no goddamn good at all.`
` Time to go. <See you again>."`
`"Please send a limo to get me.`
` 'Cause everyone else will be with me too.`
` See you."`
