`...Even though it was a pitch‐black world where nothing could be seen,`
` ......for some reason, I felt Beato's presence right next to me.`
`......So I tried calling out to her.`
`{n}...You can exchange words with someone whether they're a human or a witch.`
`......So even in a world where witches have been denied......I should be allowed to talk to her...`
`"...............Beato......"`
`"......Battler, is it...`
` ...............It is done.`
` ......I...did it."`
`"...Yeah.`
` ......I didn't hear it,`
` .........but I watched you...until the very end...`
` I was watching......as you boldly stood up to that evil witch..."`
`".........With this, ...I am no longer a witch.`
` ............But, I will definitely...become a witch again...`
` ......And...`
`...I will make it so that I can be called the Golden Witch again,`
` .........and then,`
` ......when I am ready to be accepted as your opponent,`
` .........I will return once more......"`
`"No.`
` .........You...were a witch."`
`"...............Huh......?"`
`"...I...was watching.`
` .........When you took that evil witch,`
` ......and blew her away with that awesome magic, exposing her true form,`
` ...I was watching with my own eyes..."`
`"Th‐...that wasn't magic,`
` ......but the red—"`
`"No, it was magic.`
` .........You were definitely...the Golden Witch.`
` .........Even if you deny it yourself,`
` .........I'll accept it.`
` ............‘You are definitely...`
`the Golden Witch’."`
`.........When Battler said those words...`
`In the world that had been dark, ...there was suddenly a single grain.`
`...A small grain of gold, like a wheat seed, shone brightly.`
`{n}...Even though it was small, it had a strong, gold‐colored glow.`
`And......it illuminated the two of them, sitting with their backs together...`
`So they each became aware of their own form.`
`...They did not exist only as consciousness.`
`......They became aware that they had bodies, and definitely existed.`
`...No, maybe we should say that they each had been given an existence called a body.`
`When Battler looked at his own form, he wasn't that surprised.`
`...But when Beato looked at her own form, she was a little startled.`
`......From Battler's perspective, she looked just like normal,`
` ......but for a short while, she was surprised by that form...`
`".........What............`
`......is going on.........?"`
`"The glow from that grain of light......is getting stronger and stronger..."`
`That grain of wheat was no longer simply gold‐colored, but was like the light of the sun.`
`Then, it softly.........began to approach Beato's chest.`
`When that grain of the sun......was sucked inside her chest...`
`......the world became wrapped in a deep blue sky, and then a deep blue ocean spread out below them.`
`An island rose up, trees sprouted and created a forest, walls surrounded us and a ceiling swallowed us.`
`And it became adorned with more and more things,`
` ......until we realized that this was the hall in the Ushiromiya mansion.`
`In that fantastical hall where many gold butterflies beat their wings,`
` ...many tables were set up with white tablecloths, like it was a party,`
` and beautiful cooking and fruits were set out.`
`...And over there......were a great many figures.`
`{n}Everyone was there, talking together and smiling.`
`"G‐............guys........."`
`There was Dad and Kyrie‐san, Uncle Krauss, Aunt Natsuhi and Auntie Rosa, and of course, even Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi.`
`......George‐aniki, Jessica, Maria, ...wait, wait, even Shannon‐chan, Kanon‐kun, Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san are here.`
`Everyone, everyone was at the party, clapping their hands and celebrating our return...`
`"Wh‐...why...?`
` Everyone was dead...!`
` Why are they alive...?!"`
`"......In the Golden Land, all the dead people's souls can be revived.`
` ......Welcome back, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` And welcome, Battler‐kun.`
` Welcome to the Golden Land."`
`"............I...made it?`
` ...I made it...`
`to the door of the Golden Land?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......Milady, you have finally been able to invite everyone to the Golden Land.`
` ...Welcome, Battler‐sama, to the Golden Land."`
`"Battler.`
` .........So, you have finally made it this far."`
`"G‐Grandfather...`
` .........Where in the world...am I..."`
`"...My blood, which is...incompatible with magic, runs more deeply in your veins than any other.`
` ...Therefore, you were the only one who could not reach the Golden Land, and {f:5:Beatrice} has been searching for you ever since.`
` ...She tried everything to bring you here."`
`"............What did you say......?"`
`"It seems that we are all here at last."`
`"Battler‐sama, if you would take your seat.`
` Tonight's dinner is my very best work.`
` If you would, please relish it."`
`"You should be honored!!`
` Normally, I would have eaten all of it, but I left you guys some out of pity!"`
`"......The seven stake babes..."`
`"In the Golden Land, all of those with minds are equal.`
` ......Here, there is no distinction between us furniture, {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, or witches."`
`"...Battler‐sama.`
` We were waiting for you.`
` And welcome to the Golden Land..."`
`"Shannon‐chan, ......George‐aniki...!!"`
`"......I'm still suspecting that this might be a dream...`
` I'm sure that we died.`
` ......But, ...we're alive.`
` And everyone, every one of us is here, ......and we're all happy.`
` ...I can't believe it."`
`"That's right, this place must be a dream worrld!`
` So it doesn't matter that George is so friendly with a maid girl, it has to be a dreeeam!`
` Waaaaaah!"`
`"Give it a rest, Eva.`
` For now, you gotta stay quiet and bless the two young 'uns.`
` The Golden Land is a capital of bliss.`
` We should never quarrel here...!"`
`"Here, any people are free to love each other.`
` ...No one needs to hesitate over it."`
`"Jessica‐chan, Kanon‐kun, so wonderfuul!`
` I'm so jealouuus!"`
`"......H‐hey, Battler...`
` This is kinda, umm, wahahahaha..."`
`"Battler‐sama, welcome.`
` And welcome home..."`
`Jessica was probably embarrassed because she was holding hands with Kanon‐kun.`
`And Kanon‐kun wanted to act humbly like a servant and bow,`
` but since neither of them could let go of the other's hand, he couldn't do it so well, and the whole scene looked fairly comical.`
`"With a servant child...?!!`
` I forbid it, I couldn't possibly give away our Jessica to such a person...!!"`
`"Why not allow it?`
` Let her at least choose the person she likes."`
`"I forbid it, I forbid it, aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaahhh, Jessicaaaaaaaaa!"`
`"Mine has gone awry toooooo, ohhhhh, Geooooooooorge!"`
`...As Aunt Natsuhi and Auntie Eva hugged each other, they cried tears of regret for their darling children.`
`......Even though they had always been at odds.`
` ...It was a very bizarre scene.`
`"......It isn't really a problem, right?`
` It doesn't matter who likes who."`
`"Exactly.`
` It's proof the parent hasn't let go of their child."`
`"Battleer,`
` you can bring home whatever kind of woman you want, I'll accept her waaarmly, alright?"`
`"You can't introduce her to this guy, you know?`
` He'll get his hands on her immediately.`
` He'll elope right away."`
`"............Battler.`
` You finally came here.`
` Kihhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi."`
`"Maria...`
` .........From the beginning,`
` .........you knew that we would be coming here......?"`
`"Uu!`
` That's why I wasn't scared at all.`
` Everyone was a fraidy‐cat.`
` It was funny!"`
`"......What the hell.`
` ...Even though I thought you were the most screwed up,`
` ...you actually knew the truth from the beginning."`
`"H‐how rude...!`
` It is absolutely unforgivable to speak of Lady {f:5:Maria} in that way!"`
`"Forming firing curve, attack preparations ready.`
` Lady {f:5:Maria}, we can attack at any time.`
` Nihi!"`
`"Kihhihihihihihihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi...!`
` Ouch!"`
`"...Quiet.`
` You are in the presence of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"Well, there's no need to be quite so strict.`
` For now, let us take their desire to fool around and play together into consideration.`
` More importantly, why don't we begin preparing for the toast?"`
`"Yes, I have finished preparing my excellent mackerel cooking.`
` I can serve it at any time."`
`"Hey!! Ladies!`
` Work a little more like furniture!!"`
`"Nooooo!!`
` I wanna stuff myself some mooore!`
` Wahhhhhhh!"`
`"Come on, let's work.`
` Don't keep the guests waiting.`
` Let's work studiously and attend to them.`
` Don't let the guests do anything.`
` Make them lazy, make them slothful, fatten them like pigs.`
` Ahhahaha!"`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Battler‐kun.`
` This way."`
`Grandfather and {f:5:Virgilia} were standing on the landing at the top of the staircase, beckoning us.`
`Beato and I looked at each other quizzically, then climbed the stairs together.`
`From the hall, it looked like a very high stage.`
`A small table had been set up there, as well as a piece of parchment and an old‐fashioned quill pen.`
`I saw that strange magical characters and Japanese were written side by side.`
`{n}...And below it, many names were written.`
`There were 17 of them.`
` ......Grandfather was the first, and everyone else's names had been signed below in one long column.`
`The people who arrived at the Golden Land probably signed this one after another.`
`"Battler.`
` Now that you are here, everyone is gathered.`
` Listen carefully."`
`"The Golden Land is not a world supported by the power of magic alone.`
` The cooperation and approval of all humans who receive happiness here is required.`
` For that sake, we must gather the signatures of everyone here."`
`"Last time,`
` the door to the Golden Land was finally opened, but you refused to sign.`
` ......Although you probably don't remember it.`
` Because you refused to sign, this world was once again sealed in darkness."`
`"......Just hearing it like that, ...it kinda sounds like I've been the only stubborn one,`
` and I've been causing everyone all kinds of trouble..."`
`"That is because you are a certified hardhead.`
` It seems that you inherited more than just blood from Kinzo."`
`Beato laughed amiably.`
` I knew I was being made fun of, but that smile led me to go along with her, and I laughed without thinking.`
`"Magic is a miracle.`
` ......Miracles cannot be completed unless everyone believes.`
` ......And when you do, as the last to do so, this miracle—the Golden Land—will be completed."`
`"..................It looks like I've been a real pain.`
` ...So, what should I do...?"`
`"First, sign here.`
` Then, {f:5:Beatrice}, sign here."`
`"......It's hard to use a quill pen.`
` ...Whoa, it shot."`
`"You klutz.`
` Shooting ink is a bad omen.`
` Can't you at least write your name quickly?`
` In that illegible scrawl.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"And what about you...!`
` Don't write it in {c:86EF9C:{ruby:katakana:capitals}} like that!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} is a stylish name, so write it in cursive!`
` You're making the quill and your name cry!"`
`"Sh‐shut up, in school, didn't they tell you not to use cursive on tests?"`
`"This is a solemn ceremony. Be silent."`
`"Very good.`
` We have gathered the two signatures, as well as the form for the covenant.`
` ......Both of you, your oath please.`
` We'll start with {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Put your hand on the covenant, and take the oath."`
`"......‘I, {f:5:Beatrice}, as a good witch, swear to continue with my training for the sake of bringing happiness to the people’.`
` ...Say it."`
`"......M‐......mm...`
` ......I‐it's a little embarrassing."`
`"......I, B‐{f:5:Beatrice}, as a good witch,`
` swear to continue with my training for the sake of bringing happiness to the people.`
` ......Is that alright?"`
`"Good.`
` Battler is next."`
`"In the same way, Battler‐kun.`
` Put your hand on the covenant, and take the oath.`
` ......‘I, Ushiromiya Battler, as a member of the Golden Land, swear to serve for the sake of bringing happiness to myself and my neighbor’."`
`"Ah,`
` ...I, Ushiromiya Battler,`
` as a member of the Golden Land, swear to serve for the sake of bringing happiness to myself and my neighbor.`
` ......I'm embarrassed too..."`
`"Hear me, one and all...!!`
` Here and now, we have gathered the oaths of all 18 humans accepting the Golden Land...!!"`
`When Kinzo proclaimed that, everyone applauded at once, praising us.`
`......Since I'd been the only stubborn one and had just been a nuisance, I felt a little bad about being the most celebrated one.`
`"And with that, in accordance with the ancient rites, we ask Battler‐kun, the last to make the oath, to sign the invitation to the Golden Land.`
` ......This is something that invites the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, to the Golden Land.`
` The Golden Land invites the Golden Witch through a consensus of those who have accepted it, and becomes complete."`
`"Battler, I will read it out loud.`
` Listen carefully.`
` ............‘The 18 of us acknowledge the Golden Witch to be {f:5:Beatrice}, and welcome her to the Golden Land’."`
`"What's going on with you? You won't be invited unless I send an invitation?"`
`"It seems that is the ceremony.`
` It makes me uncomfortable also.`
` Why don't we end it quickly?`
` I've been so hungry for a while now."`
`"......Come to think of it, I've only been pecking at canned food and haven't eaten anything good.`
` Let's get this thing signed and be done with it."`
`"Let's see here.`
` "We accept you as a witch".`
` .........Huh?`
` That's pretty simple.`
` Damn you, Grandfather, exaggerating how it actually says it."`
`"Come on, come on, quickly."`
`"Sign, right here."`
`"............huh...?"`
`"Quickly."`
`"Sign."`
`......With slightly weird and uncomfortable smiles, the two of them started demanding that I sign...`
`At that time, an incredible sound like that of a glass window breaking reverberated through the hall,`
` and the bustling tumult melted back into complete silence.`
`I dropped the quill pen and turned around, trying to see what had happened.`
`When I did,`
` ...............where had she come from?`
`...A human who clearly hadn't been there a short while ago was in the very center of the hall, ...looking up at us.`
`Who's that......?`
` ......A woman?`
`{n}She's probably about the same age as Jessica and me.`
`......But I didn't know that face.`
`{n}None of the other people here knew that face either.`
`"......Wh‐......who are you?!`
` Who is this?!`
` Where did you come from?!`
` Those without invitations are not needed in my party.`
` Servants, throw her out!!"`
`"As you command!!`
` Surround her!!"`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory surrounded her from seven directions, taking out magic blades that drew purple trails and blocking her.`
`And from out of nowhere, shuffling goat‐head servants appeared in great numbers, surrounding that woman.`
`On top of that, the Chiester Sisters stood in front of Beato like a wall, readying a golden bow and pulling back the bowstring...`
`"......................................."`
`But the woman didn't move at all.`
`...On the contrary, she was still staring at us on the landing, not paying them the slightest bit of attention.`
`......Who is she looking at...?`
` Beato?`
` Grandfather?`
`............It couldn't be......me.........?`
`Yes.`
` ...The woman was staring straight into my eyes, ...glaring.`
`{n}Then, after our eyes met perfectly, she yelled.`
`"You must not sign that!!!`
` Are you going to accept your own defeat?!`
` Don't be tricked by the witch!!!"`
`"......Huh?`
` By the witch,`
` ......huh?!"`
`Just then, something incredibly strong lifted me by the nape of my neck.`
`...Wh‐what's going on...?!`
`And after I was forced to turn around,`
` ......I saw {f:5:Virgilia} with an eerie smile on her face, and the muscular forms of goat monsters...`
`A goat monster that looked like it was two meters tall was holding me up with an arm as thick as a log...!`
`"Hohhohohohohohohohohohoho...`
` There is no need to listen to an uninvited guest.`
` Come, give your signature as well.`
` On this written oath.`
` "Ushiromiya Battler accepts the existence of witches".`
` Come now, sign the written oath...!!"`
`"Ow, ...owowowowowowowowowowowow!!`
` D‐damn it, let go!!!"`
`As the goat monsters constricted me with the power of a vise, they forced me to grab the quill pen.`
`...I couldn't even touch the floor with my feet, much less resist...!`
`"Battleer, why are you resistiiiing?`
` Weren't you just about to sign willinglyyy...?`
` Don't change your mind now, after all that, alriiiight?"`
`"Didn't you think for an instant, ...that it might be alright to accept witches?`
` You thought that, riiiiiight?`
` Kukki{0}ki{0}ki{0}kka{0}kka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}kakaka!!"`
`"............I,`
` ......I was...`
`...tr‐`
`...tricked......?`
` That can't be.........`
` You aren't that kind of—"`
`".............................."`
`"......Hi......hihhihahhahhahaaaHAAaHAHHH!!"`
`"Sorrrrry, Battleerrr, I am that kind of persooooooooooon!!`
` Aah, it's no good, I can't keep this up, it looks like sentimental sob stories don't match well with meeeeeeeeeee!!`
` Master, with all your strength, if you please!!`
` That was such a plain role to play, and I got so bored!"`
`"I don't know who you are, woman!!`
` But I'll beat you to death, mash you and crush you until threads start trailing, got iii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiit?!`
` I'll make you regret being born a womaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaan,`
` hyahhaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaahh!!"`
`Beato raised her gold pipe high,`
` and the massive chandelier hanging in the hall crackled with electricity, and from that fell an almighty purple thunderbolt...!`
`It was a direct hit on the woman right below it, and should have turned her to ash.`
`However, ......not a single hair was singed.`
`"Hoh...!!`
` I see you have what it takes to show up uninvited...!!`
` Tell me! Say your name!!"`
`"I don't have any name to tell {i:you}.`
` .........More importantly."`
`"......You idiot!!!`
` How long are you going to be tricked?!!`
` Stop being so naive and trusting!!`
` Figure it out already!!`
` All this, all of this is the witch's trap!!"`
`Those words were aimed at me.`
`......This is all...`
`...the witch's trap, she says...?`
`That can't be...`
`{n}Beato reformed and swore to become a good witch......`
`".....................Beato...............`
` ...Calling it a trap...`
`...is a lie, right......?`
` Please.........tell me it's a lie......"`
`"......Sorry, Battleer.`
` It was pretty interesting."`
`"...Still, I was just trying to do what Master told me, but it really did work very well!"`
`"I hear, after acting {ruby:tsuntsun:bad‐tempered} and exploring the depths of cruelty, if you act properly incompetent and {ruby:dere:soft}, you can get a massive rise on that goodwill meter thing, riiight?"`
`"I've heard that villains who go {ruby:dere:soft} and then {ruby:yan:crazy} are pretty popular these daaaays...!`
` Despite how I loook, I've studied a lot of manga, anime, and {c:86EF9C:galge} that have been popular recently, you seeee?"`
`"And I tried it out, and just as expected, it was "tears please", and you're down!!"`
`"Hihhyahhahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha, idioooot, what a truly simple person!!`
` They call this the "North Wind and the Sun Strategy".`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"......How could............`
` ............D‐`
`............damn you......`
` You two‐faced bitch......`
` How dare you deceive me like this...!!"`
`"...................................."`
`"......Yes, that expression fits you the most.`
` That caring expression of yours really doesn't match me after all.`
` My back was itching, and I was frantically trying to withstand it.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"Too baaad, wiiiitches...don't reforrrm{p:0:☆}"`
`"Hyaahhahhahhahhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!!`
` You take care of the signature, Master!`
` This uninvited guest is my prey!!"`
`"Come, you can no longer refuse to sign.`
` ......Now, come on.`
` Sign it and offer your body, your mind, and your soul...!!"`
`When {f:5:Virgilia} lifted her chin as a signal, the goat monsters, with an even more vise‐like power,`
` forced my arm to approach the parchment......!`
`Owowowow... These guys are trying to make me sign, even if it breaks my arm......`
`At that moment, a bright red light burst open with me at the center, knocking the witches and the goat monsters away.`
`Did that woman save me......?!`
`{n}B‐but who in the world is that? I don't have a clue!`
`"How long do you plan to keep playing in a place like this...?`
` Enough already.`
` I'm jealous of you."`
`"............I, I'm glad you saved me, but that's a pretty cruel way to say it.`
` ...Sorry, but who are you...?"`
`".....................`
` ...............Witch of Rokkenjima!!`
` It's time you gave him back!!"`
`"Kuhhahahahahahahahah!!`
` Who would do that, you fool!!`
` Battler is my toy.`
` My favorite toy, the best toy in the world...!!"`
`"I won't get tired of him, I won't throw him away, I won't hand him over to anyone!!`
` Even Battler is enjoying this to the fullest.`
` Together with me, he is having so much fun playing.`
` No matter who you are, I won't let you interfere...!!"`
`"Oh yeah, it really does look like you're living it up here, I'm so jealous my blood is boiling!!`
` In a wonderful place like this, guffawing and having a lively, fun, noisy blast of a time with everyone!"`
`"Surrounded by lots of eye‐candy witches and being pampered all the time,`
` I'm sure you're having so much fun, you don't even want to come back!!"`
`"......A‐...are you talking to me...?`
` Wait wait, you've got the wrong idea...!`
` This is a pain for me too!`
` The hell is fun about this, you don't know a damn thing about my troubles...!"`
`"What troubles?!!!`
` You get to have fun living with Mom and Dad, you get to play around happily with all of the cousins,`
` you get to play with pleasant witches as long as you want for all eternity!"`
`"Don't you realize the happiness you have?!`
` I'm jealous of all of you, don't you get it?!`
` I'd love to be part of all this!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` I'm sorry, but no.`
` I am satisfied with the toys I have.`
` A rude toy like you is not fitting for my toy box!"`
`"Yes, I'm aware of that.`
` Who would ever play with someone like you?`
` ......But I will thank you a bit.`
` ......For bringing everyone together like this."`
`"......Who...`
`......are you...`
` .....................You can't be—"`
`"......I see, so that's it...`
` .........Yes, I get it, I know who you are!`
` ...I see,`
` so {i:you} are the piece Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} threw in.`
` I like it!!"`
`"Why don't I formally invite you to my party?!!`
` I'll welcome you fully...!!`
` Along with Battler, I'll play with you nicely, break you, kill you, crush you, turn you to ash, mix you with bread dough and bake you until you're fluffy!!`
` Fuhha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaahh!!"`
`".........Ohhhh, that's no good, no good at all!`
` You'll never be able to do that!`
` Rokkenjima, in the year 1986.`
` ...I will expose everything that happened then to the light of day!"`
`"I'll teach you that you're no more than needle ice, scared of the spring of truth!`
` Prepare yourself, Golden Witch!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}!!!"`
