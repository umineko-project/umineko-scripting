`"......Certainly, the body cannot last with nothing more than a small breakfast, but..."`
`"Of course, we understand.`
` But the thing is, as time passes, it'll get darker and darker.`
` Now is probably the lightest.`
` Now is the most convenient time."`
`"Only about an hour has passed since Rosa‐san was attacked.`
` This is simply too reckless...!"`
`It was only natural that Natsuhi was yelling about recklessness.`
`{n}...Because Rudolf had said that he was going to the mansion to get food.`
`Certainly, they were being tormented by hunger as well as their fatigue.`
`In the beginning, they were just fine, because they could fight their moderate hunger with their drowsiness;`
` but now it just made their minds hazy, and even though it was still only midday, their bodies felt like they were reaching their limits.`
`The thought of going to the kitchen in the mansion and bringing back some food certainly was attractive.`
`"I am opposed to this.`
` It may be a little tough, but we definitely shouldn't leave this place."`
`"......It is alright for us.`
` But it would pain my heart to keep the children hungry...`
` I must bear my responsibility as a parent."`
`"D‐dear...!`
` Now that Father has passed away, you are the Ushiromiya family head.`
` It is not permissible for you to take on such a danger...!"`
`".........Yes.`
` It's like Natsuhi‐san says.`
` Krauss‐san, you should remain here as the leader."`
`"......Then, who will go to the mansion?"`
`"I think Kyrie and I, and Hideyoshi nii‐san as well, should go.`
` Hideyoshi nii‐san and I are holding guns.`
` They shouldn't be able to lay a hand on us that easily."`
`"Rosa‐san was also holding a gun, but she was attacked.`
` ...Isn't it dangerous?"`
`"...When I went out to check on Rosa and Maria‐chan, I was alone, although I had a gun with me.`
` But I wasn't attacked.`
` ......Maybe they'll be cautious if their opponent is a man."`
`"Two men.`
` And even two guns.`
` Those two will act as guards, and I'll push the cart with the things.`
` I believe the situation clearly differs from Rosa‐san's."`
`"If you're countin' me as a man, I'd be pleased to help.`
` I don't look it, but I trained this body pullin' stalls.`
` Leave the heavy liftin' to me!"`
`"You men just need to devote yourselves to guarding.`
` There's a folding cart in the servant room, so using that, I should be able to handle carrying the food alone."`
`"......Of course, we will be careful.`
` And if we can succeed in this venture just once,`
` we'll never again need to take the risk of leaving this place."`
`"............Is there any way I can get you to reconsider?`
` It may be painful for everyone to deal with an empty stomach, ...but even so, we do not know what could happen outside now..."`
`"We'll take care.`
` ......And Eva's feelin' pretty darn bad right now.`
` I can't let her stay hungry.`
` If her stomach's empty, she can't even take her medicine.`
` I've gotta go out for Eva's sake as well."`
`"How is Eva?"`
`"She's finally gotten to sleep.`
` ...She's burnin' up, too.`
` We should leave her be for a while..."`
`"......I guess you can't just stand still when it comes to your wife's health...`
` .........Understood.`
` I'll give you permission to go outside."`
`"Then, we'll take a little trip there and back.`
` A speed contest.`
` Canned food is OK, right?`
` You at least have a can opener here, right?"`
`"Y‐yes.`
` We have a can opener and a bottle opener..."`
`"There's running water in the guesthouse, so we won't need anything to drink.`
` There's ten people to cover for, so you'll have to take what you get."`
`"Alright!`
` Let's dash out there and bring it all back pronto.`
` There's no time to open umbrellas...!"`
`"So, Aniki.`
` Watch the place for me."`
`"......Be careful.`
` ...Under normal circumstances, I would want to go too.`
` ...Being a man, I despise this title of eldest brother that prevents me from lending a hand in an emergency like this."`
`"This is about the only time we get to show off.`
` Sit back and take it easy every once in a while, Aniki.`
` Alright, Natsuhi‐san.`
` Wait here and get some towels ready or something.`
` We aren't using umbrellas, so we'll be coming back like drowned rats."`
`"U‐understood.`
` ...Take care."`
`Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi,`
` each leaving their own brave words behind, left the lobby...`
`Compared to the time Rosa and Maria had gone outside, the winds had picked up once again.`
`Rudolf's group of three people jogged through the rose garden without umbrellas, holding their guns and a folded cart.`
`If everything had been still and quiet, without the wind and the rain, they would probably have kept their ears open and moved with caution.`
`But in this rain, even if some suspicious person was hiding nearby, it would be difficult to notice them.`
`Because of that, it had been Rudolf's plan to instead dash through the dangerous area.`
`......If there was a chance that their opponent was equipped with a gun,`
` then walking slowly with their guard up would only make them a target.`
`It was probably correct to decide on swift action.`
`".........The rose garden.`
` It feels like we're just askin' to be attacked...!"`
`"Please, let nobody come out of there..."`
`Even as Rudolf and Hideyoshi continued to run, they looked around restlessly, vigilant of their surroundings.`
`Rosa and Maria's deaths had not been caused by a projectile.`
`{n}......However, it was easy to suspect that the servants had been killed in such a manner.`
`Will they come flying out of the dark?`
`{n}Or will they take careful aim and snipe from the shadows?`
`......Either way, they couldn't relax their tension for even an instant.`
`But even so, when they reached the overhang in front of the entrance to the mansion and escaped the reach of the raindrops,`
` they felt themselves breathing a sigh of relief.`
`"No problems for the first part.`
` ......It's not like how it was for Rosa‐san.`
` Maybe they can't get their hands on us easily."`
`"I'd like to believe that.`
` Kyrie, unlock the door while we keep a lookout."`
`"Sure.`
` Returning home to the mansion with a pair of bodyguards makes me feel just like an executive."`
`"Wahahahaha.`
` If we had a welcoming party of servants on a red carpet, it'd be perfect."`
`"A welcoming party, huh.`
` ...Careful what you wish for.`
` Stay alert."`
`As the two cautiously surveyed their surroundings,`
` Kyrie unlocked the front door with the master key she had been given.`
`"It's open."`
`"Hideyoshi nii‐san.`
` Could you take the front?`
` I'll keep an eye on the rear."`
`"Roger.`
` Kyrie‐san, try not to move from my shadow.`
` ......Alright, let's break in!"`
`"Rear guard, understood. Covering...!"`
`"......Men.`
` You're enjoying this situation a little bit, aren't you?"`
`"Give it up, that's how men are.`
` ......But man, there's still that rank stench."`
`...The air in the mansion felt stagnant with a heavy silence.`
`And worse, it was still thick with the stench from Kinzo's burnt corpse in the boiler room,`
` and they were struck with a strong desire to leave the mansion—although they were never planning to stay.`
`"No problems in the front.`
` Just a short dash to the kitchen."`
`"Let's finish this quickly and head home.`
` This suit'll get fumigated with Dad's stench."`
`The three of them dashed towards the kitchen...`
`And after they disappeared from the entrance hall, ......the new witch showed herself there.`
`"They were lured out just as planned.`
` ......They got caught right in my trap."`
`The witch grinned.`
`......Thinking about it now, no matter how unbearable their hunger had grown,`
` barely a few hours had passed since Rosa and Maria had been attacked and had lost their lives.`
`In that case, why had they needed to recklessly leave the guesthouse...?`
`Until that question could be dealt with, the only answer was that they had been called out by the witch's magic...`
`"What reckless people.`
` ......They will never leave this mansion alive.`
` Lock yourself, locks! Close yourself, mansion!"`
`The instant she proclaimed that...`
`...the mansion was sealed off in a separate world.`
`......Unless she were to dispel the barrier, no longer could anyone exit this mansion, or enter it.`
`"......Spectacular.`
` To think that even though barely half a day has passed since you succeeded the Endless Witch, you can use magic this well.`
` ......That talent surprises me.`
` It is almost as though you were born a witch."`
`"Well, I {i:have} been a witch since the time I was born.`
` ......Who taught you how to blink?`
` That's what using magic is like for me."`
`".....................`
` ...A fearsome person."`
`The witch's face twisted with brutality.`
`{n}......She was beside herself with excitement at being able to toy with lives again.`
`"Well then.`
` ......Gehehehe{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihyahya!`
` First is Rudolf and Kyrie, but what cruel way should I kill them...?!"`
`"......If you would excuse me,`
` but the Predecessor has left instructions that you are to restrain yourself from committing murders of unnecessary cruelty.`
` And, there is a protocol to follow for the sacrifices from the fourth twilight onwards.`
` For that, you must borrow the power of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory."`
`"......Oh, really?`
` Now that you mention it, that's right.`
` I'm only allowed to play as I like until the second twilight I just finished.`
` ..................Boring.`
` Just when I thought I could play to my heart's content like I did with Rosa.`
` ......But, that refers to the way they're killed in the end, right?"`
`"By which you mean..."`
`"So I can just kill them however I want over and over again, revive them,`
` and follow the epitaph the last time I kill them, right?"`
`"......So, in the end, no matter how I play, it isn't a problem.`
` ......Who'd act well‐behaved with an interesting power like this...?!`
` Kuhhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!"`
`Her wild logic was, for an Endless Witch, an extremely valid argument.`
`{n}The sacrifices for the fourth twilight and onward had prescribed protocols for the method of killing, represented by things like "gouge the head".`
`However, that referred to the way they died in the end.`
`In other words, ......in the process leading up to that, she was free to tease and kill them however she wanted.`
`She just had to keep on reviving them, and follow the rules only when she killed them the final time.`
`Even while Ronove glimpsed some talent as a witch in her innocent cruelty,`
` he was beginning to notice a naturally brutal side of her.`
`"......They do say that apprentices are the most brutal of witches, and now I see that may be true."`
`".........Do as you wish, ...is what I would like to say,`
` but I must insist that it would be wiser to exercise some restraint in this instance.`
` They are holding guns.`
` Weapons with a high anti‐magic power, such as guns, are the natural enemies of witches and demons."`
`The witch stared blankly at this demon butler, who was unexpectedly afraid of guns.`
`".........No one told me this.`
` Shouldn't a witch be able to take a bullet like it's nothing?"`
`"No.`
` It would be a fatal wound, exactly the same as it would for a normal {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` ...To prevent that weak point from being noticed,`
` most witches rigorously strengthen their guard with a defense of protective barriers and furniture."`
`"Do I have any of those protective barrier things?"`
`"......Constructing a barrier to make even gun bullets ineffective requires much in preparation and rituals.`
` I am afraid to say that you currently have none of those, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` Furthermore, you are currently ill‐prepared to summon furniture strong enough to block a bullet."`
`"So even though I've become a Great Witch with this much magical power, I really do have to be afraid of lead bullets.`
` .........Annoying, but I'll just have to accept it.`
` So, in that case, should I call some furniture to act as my arms and legs?"`
`"Yes.`
` Leaving everything to your servants while not exposing yourself to danger is also part of a witch's elegant temperance.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, leave this to the furniture and hide in a safe place."`
`"...............Fine."`
`"...Seven Sisters of Purgatory.`
` I don't care who, any two of you...!"`
`Leviathan and Belphegor responded to that call.`
`"Leviathan the Envious, right here."`
`"Belphegor the Slothful, right here."`
`"Show me your power.`
` Your targets are Rudolf and Kyrie.`
` Not Hideyoshi.`
` ......Now, show me just how cruel you can be, furniture."`
`"......My apologies,`
` but we have received an order from the Predecessor to restrain ourselves from unnecessarily cruel actions."`
`"Buuut, I think the Predecessor's order does give us some leeway to tease them.`
` Will that be acceptable?"`
`"Hmph.`
` Fine, I'll compromise."`
`"......You mustn't kill them easily.`
` Thoroughly corner them and let them taste the fear of death before killing them.`
` ......Will that be alright, Ronove?"`
`"Yes. If you simply remain conscious of the extent, I do not believe there will be a problem."`
`"...............Then, go!"`
`""Yes, leave it to us...!""`
`"Your opponents are armed with guns.`
` ...For those as skilled as yourselves, dodging them should be easy,`
` ...but if you are hit, it will be fatal.`
` Go with an appropriate level of caution."`
`"Do not worry.`
` We won't expose such a level of incompetence."`
`The two Sisters of Purgatory vanished.`
`{n}After bowing, Ronove also disappeared.`
`".........There's even rules on how to kill them.`
` .........Why do I have to be constrained by my predecessor?`
` ............It's so rigid and boring."`
`As the witch looked up at the portrait of the Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice} hanging in the hall, she cursed...`
`The three had already arrived at the kitchen, and were gathering food supplies.`
`Thinking of the possibility that poison had been mixed in, they gave up on the alluring fruits and vegetables,`
` and gathered a whole cardboard box full of only the safe canned foods.`
`It was very heavy, but by piling it on the cart, they could carry it well enough.`
`With all of that, there would be plenty for ten people to hold out until tomorrow's breakfast.`
` That would be enough while they waited for the boat.`
`The two men were supposed to be devoted to guard duty, but the weight of the load was tough on Kyrie even with the cart.`
`Hideyoshi, who professed himself strong, switched to being the cart‐pusher, and Rudolf and his wife took up the task of guard duty.`
`"With all this, even George and the kids will be full.`
` We're not safe until we're home, let's go...!"`
`When Hideyoshi vigorously proclaimed their departure, Kyrie frowned, looking as though she was gazing into the distance.`
`......There was a wall in that direction.`
` ...No, if her gaze could go through that, the hall was beyond it...`
`".........What is it, Kyrie?"`
`"...I sense something.`
` .........I have a bad feeling about this."`
`Kyrie stopped, narrowing her eyes even further.`
`".........Women's intuition?"`
`In times like this, Kyrie's intuition surpassed reason.`
`{n}...Rudolf trusted that intuition.`
`"Yes.`
` Someone's probably waiting to ambush us.`
` ......I didn't sense them until a short while ago.`
` ...But just now, I felt it.`
` ......Just now, someone...`
`{i:set up an ambush for us}."`
`"......Then, there's no reason we need to return the way we came.`
` There's a back door over there, right?`
` Let's leave that way."`
`Rudolf made to unlock the back door.`
`When things were carried into the kitchen, they never passed through the part of the mansion that the family came and went from.`
`So outside the back door, there was probably a slope for transporting things.`
` Surely, they would be able to leave through there with the cart.`
`"......What is this?`
` ...It's stuck.`
` ...Damn, what's going on?"`
`"Can't you open it?"`
`"Nope.`
` Is it broken?`
` It isn't giving an inch..."`
`Rudolf tried various things, using force, then coaxing it,`
` but the lock was as hard as stone, and didn't even budge.`
`"...Don't stress over it, let's leave through the front entrance.`
` Right now, it'll be even worse if we stand around wastin' time."`
`".............................."`
`"......Are you saying this is a trap?"`
`"...I don't know.`
` Be careful."`
`With strained expressions, the three of them returned to the hall again, and headed for the entrance...`
`"Wh‐......who's there?!!"`
`The instant they exited into the hall, Rudolf noticed a suspicious shadow right in front of them and yelled...`
`In that instant, a storm of gold leaf started blowing, and gold butterflies dyed the area a golden color.`
`"............I can't believe it.`
` A lowly {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} predicted our ambush?"`
`"I‐it isn't my fault.`
` I was hiding my presence...!"`
`"Don't hesitate!! FIRE!!!"`
`The two guns spouted fire.`
`The lead bullets blasted right through the pair's magic defense as easily as though it were a wet paper wall,`
` ......but the two who should have been there had disappeared.`
`Certainly, guns were very frightening objects for them.`
`...But there was no need to fear as long as they weren't hit.`
`{n}They at least had enough speed to dodge those.`
`"Wait a sec!`
` You won't even let us say our names?!`
` This is why I hate {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s!"`
`Leviathan protested, popping her head out from behind a pillar in the shadow of the staircase, a full ten meters from where she had supposedly been.`
`"By order of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, we shall now slay you!`
` We are ordered to take some time teasing you.`
` You are free to resist, but know that it is useless...!"`
`That voice came from overhead.`
`{n}Belphegor could be seen on top of the hall chandelier.`
`{n}Elegantly looking down upon them, she proclaimed their execution with a cruel smile.`
`"......Wh‐`
`......who the heck are these girls...?!"`
`"Forget the cart!!`
` We have two opponents, so if we split up, they can't chase all of us!"`
`All three of them were well acquainted with the inside of the mansion.`
`They had already made plans to run off in separate directions in the case of a crisis, returning to the guesthouse by breaking windows or leaving through a back door.`
`Fighting was forbidden.`
` ......As long as they could get away.`
`"Hah‐hah‐ha, of the thirty‐six stratagems, fleeing is best...!!"`
`The three of them escaped into the depths of the mansion at full tilt.`
`{n}The two furniture calmly watched them go.`
`"......I'll kill the woman.`
` You take the man!"`
`"Understood."`
`The two pieces of furniture in the shadow of the pillar and on the chandelier burst apart their humanlike forms,`
` and, leaving behind only the sound of hopping beetles colliding with the walls, they pursued their respective targets.`
`Their speed was overwhelming, and they easily blocked the others' path of retreat.`
`"............I'll inspect their skill as furniture.`
` It'd be nice if they entertained me."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, I might suggest it wise not to show yourself carelessly..."`
`"A king doesn't carelessly wander about the center.`
` That's part of a king's—`
`a witch's dignity!"`
`In front of Rudolf, who had boldly tried to escape to the second floor, Belphegor was already standing in the way.`
`"It's useless to try and resist or escape.`
` ......You don't need to think about anything.`
` Just close your eyes.`
` I'll bring everything to a gentle finish."`
`"You'd make a good wife.`
` Your husband would be pleased to hear that kind of thing when he comes home tired."`
`"To think that you're still relaxed enough to speak such vulgarity at a time like this...!"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, thank you for such good prey!`
` Die!!!"`
`Rudolf fired first.`
`But even before that bullet could hit her, Belphegor had already moved behind Rudolf's back.`
`There she stood, her arm raised above her, a purple trail extending from it...`
`However, even before that arm could decapitate Rudolf, unbelievably, Rudolf had swung his gun behind him.`
`The barrel pointed behind his back, from the same motion with which he had reloaded the sawed‐off gun one‐handedly.`
`It was pointing right at Belphegor's chest...`
`Takk, clunk‐rrrr...!`
` It was the sound of the ejected empty cartridge finally hitting the wall after the reload.`
`In other words, it meant that the next shot was already fully loaded.`
`Without turning around, his gun pointing right at Belphegor's chest, Rudolf grinned.`
`".........Not bad.........`
` ...For a middle‐aged man...!!"`
`"Don't look down on the generation that loves westerns, got it?`
` Brats don't know jack squat about the refinement of a lever‐action."`
`Just like Rudolf, Kyrie was also confronting a demon stake, in the first floor corridor.`
`"What an idiot you are.`
` You should have just escaped with your husband.`
` You do know that that was your final farewell just now, right...?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"Don't worry.`
` This kind of thing is my husband's specialty.`
` I'm sure he'll come for me on a white horse soon."`
`"Because he's never failed to come and save me when I'm in trouble.`
` ......Not even when Asumu‐san was around, you see?`
` Heheh."`
`"Heheheheheheheh!`
` What a happy couple.`
` I envy you.`
` .........I am Leviathan the Envious...!`
` Envy is itself my power.`
` My anger, my origin!"`
`"I agree.`
` Envy is the source of a woman's power.`
` ...And if you call something like that power, I won't lose to a girl like you."`
`"Hahhahahahahahahahaha!`
` Imagine saying that to the one who governs envy!`
` You actually think I'd let you two be reunited...?!!"`
`"Ahhahahahaha, I'll give you a tragic farewell!!"`
`The arm Leviathan swung trailed purple.`
`{n}It was a magic blade that cut by the power of malice.`
`Kyrie guarded herself against that with her gun.`
`......Even though the magic blade should have been able to cut through metal like butter, the {i:gun}, with its extremely high magic resistance,`
` was able to block the blade as easily as if it were a rolled up newspaper.`
`Rapidly, two times, three times.`
` It blocked all of them.`
`And, without missing the opening created when that purple trail took a long swing upward,`
` Kyrie kicked Leviathan in the stomach with her heel.`
`Almost like she was a lightly dancing feather, Leviathan was knocked away.`
`...Before the demon stake's feet touched ground again...`
`Kyrie had already perfectly captured Leviathan, who was in midair, down the barrel of her gun.`
`From midair, the two women who had spoken to each other of envy as power met each other's gaze.`
`"......C‐can you pull it?`
` That trigger...!!"`
`"You know, I can be pretty brutal when my husband isn't around."`
`"Whoawhoaoaoaoao!!"`
`Rudolf tumbled down the staircase.`
` He had been gradually chased down by Belphegor, and had been pushed back into the original hall.`
`".........The Predecessor's furniture is pretty good.`
` She's lacking in flair, though!"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...!`
` It isn't over yet, it's dangerous to show yourself...!"`
`"........................Could you...`
`...possibly be...Aneki?"`
`"That used to be my name.`
` But not now, Rudolf."`
`"You don't have to tell me.`
` You're going to say you're the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, right?"`
`"Ehheheheheh, ahhahahahaha!`
` How did you know?"`
`"......Since the time Rosa was killed, I had a general idea."`
`".........Rosa, forgive me.`
` Forgive me for sending the sister you hated down to your hell...!!"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, look out!!!"`
`Rudolf pointed the unforgiving barrel of his gun at the witch who claimed to have once been his sister.`
`{n}But Belphegor could not permit that, and savagely attacked.`
`She sprung at him, vanished, and got behind him.`
`If he dodged that attack, she got behind him again.`
`She vanished over and over, each time teleporting into Rudolf's blind spot.`
`It was almost like she was a fairy.`
` As she blinked in and out of vision, Belphegor incessantly drove towards Rudolf.`
`"This might be kinda fun in its own way.`
` Rudolf, let me leisurely watch and see how long your brave efforts last you.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`Then, a dull tearing sound and Rudolf's cry of anguish intermingled.`
`Rudolf had finally reacted too slowly in his dance with the purple trail which pressed upon him,`
` and he had let it lightly cut him on his side.`
`A single wound delayed a single one of his actions.`
`That caused a new wound, which delayed him from acting again.`
`Belphegor's dance began to swallow Rudolf whole...`
`Watching Rudolf's body gradually get carved up, his former sister let out a shrill laugh.`
`Leviathan could no longer hide her irritation that Kyrie was absolutely refusing to allow her to deliver a fatal wound.`
`".........I really am dense.`
` ...Among the Seven Sisters, I was always the slowest to grow.`
` I was always slow, always weak, always stupid."`
`"......That inferiority complex became envy,`
` and when I converted that into power, I gained a strength greater than that of any of the other sisters."`
`"It's important to have a moderate inferiority complex when you're a girl.`
` It teaches women about cosmetics and hard work."`
`"I don't like using the limits of my power against mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.`
` ......But I will turn my envy of your ability to completely trust your husband into power."`
`"......I don't like it.`
` Why are you so relaxed when you're fighting for your life?"`
`"......*giggle*.`
` I wonder?"`
`"............I get it.`
` You fully believe that your husband will definitely come to rescue you and will save you.`
` .........Isn't it incredible, that trust of yours.`
` It's worthy of my envy."`
`What kind of trust do we sisters have in each other?`
`We sisters are always looking down on each other, trying to thoroughly lambast each other and turn things from bad to worse...!`
`"I've always been bullied by my sisters.`
` I've always wanted just one of them to become my ally."`
`"......So since you have that single ally,`
` who you can place complete trust in, I feel the strongest envy towards you..."`
`"............Aaah, that composed expression of total belief in your husband...!`
` I can feel my envy giving me power...!!`
` .........I might even exceed it.`
` The speed of sound!!!"`
`Leviathan turned herself into a stake, and the speed of her flight as she attacked was proportional to the strength of her envy.`
`"On that day when my sisters looked down on me,`
` I was jealous from the bottom of my heart of the other six, who had grown quickly!`
` I was jealous for seven days and seven nights!!`
` Behold the power and speed I ultimately gained...!!`
` Die, Ushiromiya Kyrieee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeee!!!"`
`The demon stake exposed her true form, leaping about at a terrible speed.`
` The noise from her colliding with and bouncing off the walls sounded like a machine gun.`
`By now, Kyrie probably couldn't tell whether it was a single stake or a swarm of beetles flying and bouncing around.`
`Leviathan was certain of a greater than 100% chance of victory, from the bottom of her heart...!`
`Then, Kyrie spoke with an unbelievably calm voice.`
`".........I was the one who had been going out with Rudolf‐san from the very beginning.`
` ......Asumu‐san shamelessly cut in between us,`
` ...and calculatingly got herself pregnant."`
`"......I don't blame Rudolf‐san.`
` That woman manipulated him using her body as a weapon,`
` and cornered him into a situation where he was forced to become engaged to her."`
`Asumu‐san was carrying Battler‐kun.`
`And at the same time, I was also carrying a boy.`
`...As fate would have it, our delivery dates were on the same day.`
`"And Asumu‐san gave birth to Battler‐kun.`
` ...But I was not so lucky.`
` .........There's something I've thought about.`
` What if Asumu‐san had been the unlucky one, and I had been the one to give birth?"`
`"......Would Rudolf‐san have broken off his engagement and married me?`
` ......But I couldn't birth a child.`
` So until Asumu‐san died,`
` and until I got pregnant with Ange, I cursed Asumu‐san, and was jealous of her."`
`Asumu‐san should just die.`
`And then I want him to remarry, with me... In my envy, I kept cursing her like that, over and over, until Asumu‐san finally died.`
`I became certain.`
`I became certain that I possessed the power of magic, and that it had become a curse which had killed Asumu‐san.`
`But that did not quell the flames of my envy.`
`Don't tell anyone, alright?`
`Every time I look at Battler‐kun, I remember that woman.`
`And every time I look at Battler‐kun,`
` ...I think that if only my child had been born, he would be the same age.`
`I am still jealous of her, tormented by her.`
`Now, and forever.`
` For all eternity.`
`"You say that you were jealous of your sisters for seven days and seven nights...?"`
`"Th‐......that's right..."`
`Don't make me laugh, you little brat.`
`".........How could you understand the madness of a woman...`
`whose man was stolen from her, and who has burned with envy for eighteen years...!!"`
`"U‐......uoawa{0}aaa{0}aAAa{0}a{0}aaAA{0}AAHHH!!!!"`
`If Leviathan's power had 24 hours × 7 days, or 168 hours' worth of speed...`
`Then the power that Kyrie had accumulated...`
`was 24 hours in 1 day,`
` 365 days in 1 year,`
` and for 18 whole years......`
`Even without counting leap years,`
` it was 157,680 hours.`
`...Compared to Leviathan's power and speed,`
` it was more than 938 times greater.`
`So then, even if Leviathan was soaring at the speed of sound, {nobreak:1,225 km/h},`
` ......to Kyrie's eyes, it only looked like...`
`1/938 of that.`
`So then, so then, 1225÷938 is...`
`.........a speed of...`
`1.30 km/h.`
`...They say that a human's walking speed is 4 km/h, so it was even less than half of that.`
` Almost the same speed as a baby crawling on the floor.`
`So then, so then, so then...!`
`In unit time slowed so much you could count all the bits of dust floating through the air,`
` Kyrie looked at the demon stake with pity.`
`She pitied the slowness at which it came towards her.`
`And she lazily raised the barrel of her gun.`
`{n}Almost as though she was trying to swallow the demon stake up with the gun barrel.`
`"You're completely lacking in both love and envy."`
`"......Come back when you're older, darling."`
`"Rudolf, what happened to all that vigor from a couple seconds ago?`
` {ruby:Sliced live fish:Ikezukuri} is best served while it's still twitching.`
` After it dies, it isn't interesting in the slightest.`
` That's enough.`
` Why not kill him now and forever?!"`
`".........kh, ......damn it......"`
`"I'm surprised you managed to endure this long after being carved up."`
`"......That's enough.`
` You don't need to think about anything more.`
` I'll steal your life away painlessly...!"`
`"Wait... Do me a favor.`
` In the very end, I want to do one of those..."`
`"......What do you mean, one of those?"`
`"One of those things that westerns made famous.`
` That thing where we put our backs together, walk three steps, and then {i:bang}."`
`"............Ah, a duel.`
` Very well.`
` If that will satisfy your regrets in this world, I'll accept."`
`Rudolf raised his wound‐covered body, and turned his back to her.`
`Belphegor responded, and faced her back to his.`
`...Belphegor had a sense of integrity that was uncommon in a witch's furniture.`
`"Let me warn you.`
` Even if you press the barrel of your gun between my eyebrows,`
` I can teleport even faster than you could pull the trigger and have the bullet reach my skull."`
`"......Yeah, I'm already feeling that throughout my body.`
` ...You are faster than a bullet."`
`"I have agreed to this out of respect for your courage in challenging me to a duel despite that knowledge.`
` Thank me."`
`"......You are a person of integrity.`
` And a good woman.`
` You might just steal my heart away."`
`"Let's get this started.`
` Three steps is fine?"`
`".........First, one step."`
`"......Two steps."`
`"......Three steps.`
` Is that alright?"`
`"Yep.`
` ......And, since you still haven't noticed after walking three whole steps,`
` ......looks like I win, girl."`
`"Whaaat......?"`
`"...........................Ah...h...!"`
`Rudolf turned around and fired off a bullet.`
`......Of course, Belphegor could easily see through the speed and trajectory of a bullet like that.`
`It should have been no problem at all to dodge it.`
`But a spray of fresh blood flew about.`
`......Belphegor had set up an adequate magical defensive barrier.`
`But before an incarnation of anti‐magic power such as that bullet, it was completely meaningless.`
`".........What are you doing?`
` Why'd you get hit...?!"`
`The bullet had hit Belphegor right in the chest.`
` ...The pain from the lead caused her to grimace, as did as the pain from the denial of magic...`
`"......Forgive me.`
` I'm a coward of a man."`
`"..................ku‐`
`...............u..."`
`"Wh‐...What a mood‐killer.`
` To think that someone who is furniture to a witch could be defeated by a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}...!"`
`"Know your shame.`
` Worthless, pathetic...!`
` Why don't you just stay sprawled there and die forever?!"`
`".........Quit it, Aneki.`
` ...This girl could have dodged it.`
` But she didn't."`
`"......She realized that you were in the line of fire.`
` So this girl of integrity took it without dodging, and guarded you.`
` In the very end, she noticed that I was forking the rook and the king."`
`"Spe‐.........spectacular............"`
`"Don't think badly of me.`
` ...I'd planned to accept my fate if you realized while you were taking those three steps."`
`"............Those three steps...`
`were out of...`
`consideration for me, then...`
` .........I didn't even try to think about it.`
` ......I...`
`...was la...`
`zy........."`
`"......You were a good woman.`
` Go to heaven before me and do your makeup.`
` I'll definitely come and talk you up."`
`As Belphegor slowly fell over, ...she lost even the power that kept her in a human form,`
` and she turned as fine as gold dust, and melted into thin air...`
`At that point, Kyrie dashed in.`
`{n}It seemed that she had defeated her pursuer with her own hands.`
`As she pointed the barrel of her gun straight at the witch, she ran up to the wound‐covered Rudolf.`
`"......Are you alright?`
` Were you talking someone up just now?"`
`"Yep, a fine woman.`
` ...No match for you, of course."`
`"............Sorry, Aneki.`
` It's checkmate."`
`The two of them pinned the witch down the barrels of their guns.`
`"............Worthless furniture.`
` ...I can't believe they were beaten by {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} opponents.`
` ...Worthless.`
` Stupid.`
` ...Boring...!"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, we should retreat from this place.`
` ......There is no furniture or barrier to guard against bullets here."`
`"Eheheheh,`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The witch began to let out a muffled laugh.`
`...It surprised not only Rudolf and Kyrie, but Ronove as well.`
`.........Because a situation like this, with two guns pointed at her,`
` was not one that could just be laughed off, even by a witch.`
`But the witch laughed with pleasure.`
`".........Well, it's only natural that it'd be impossible for the Predecessor's worn out furniture.`
` ......I have to have new furniture, suitable for me.`
` I used them out of obligation,`
` ......but I've always hated hand‐me‐downs."`
`As she said that, she looked down at Belphegor's remains, which had turned completely into a pile of gold dust, with disgust.`
`"I don't know what you're talking about.`
` Now put your damn hands up."`
`...Then, the witch obediently raised her hands.`
`But instead of raising her hands because a gun was being pointed at her,`
` it looked more like she was a conductor facing an orchestra, waving her conductor's baton.`
`"Come, arise, furniture suitable for me...!!`
` Not that cheap furniture, much much stronger ones!`
` Cruel ones!!`
` Ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahyahhyahhya!!!"`
`"No funny stuff...!`
` I'll pull the trigger...!"`
`In response to the witch's call, the hall was once again buried in the color of gold.`
`It was a wild dance of brilliantly radiant gold butterflies,`
` ...and felt as though they had been swallowed up by an ocean of gold leaf.`
`Ronove was left shocked at that upsurge in magic power...`
`{n}That was because it far surpassed even that of his former master.`
`As their eyes were dazzled amidst the golden brilliance, a gunshot could be heard.`
`{n}Either Rudolf or Kyrie had fired a round.`
`......And after the golden glow had subsided, there was the witch, looking at least cool and composed.`
`The bullet?`
` Kyrie had definitely fired it into her.`
`But it was not embedded anywhere in the witch's body.`
`There it was.`
` ...The bullet was fastened in midair right in front of the witch's chest.`
`"A, ......a bullet‐proof barrier........."`
`A barrier which took even her predecessor a significant amount of preparation...in an instant...`
`{n}Ronove's face was by now twisted in shock.`
`{n}And the surprise did not stop there......`
`The group of gold butterflies created two humanoid forms.`
`......It was a furniture summoning.`
`The butterflies peeled off and flew away, and beneath them, furniture in the shape of girls showed themselves.`
`"..................The Chiester Sisters troops...`
` .........Even the Predecessor...`
`...wasn't able to summon the Pendragon's Memorial Troops on a moment's notice, and so easily...!"`
`"Chiester{ruby:four‐one‐zero:410}. Right here."`
`"Chiester{ruby:forty‐five:45}. Right here."`
`"...You two {i:are} suitable furniture for me, right?"`
`"From reading you a picture book, to going on a friendship date, to shooting down a meteorite,`
` we'll take care of anything. Nihihi."`
`"I‐if we don't take care of it, the Dragon King will get mad at us...!`
` Please, your orders, Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}!"`
`".........Rudolf‐san.`
` Let's run.`
` These guys are no good......!"`
`"S‐.........sure!"`
`Thanks to the same feeling that had alerted her to the ambush by the Seven Sisters of Purgatory,`
` Kyrie clearly heard warning sirens going off in her head, almost resembling screams.`
`Without hesitation, they ran.`
`As the witch elegantly watched them leave, she ordered her new furniture.`
`"...This is an order.`
` Kill the two who ran away.`
` Then bring the corpses back here.`
` Then I'll bring them back to life, and play with them over and over.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`The witch's expression twisted with an evil smile.`
`Even though she feared that expression, Lucifer appeared and spoke.`
`"M‐...my apologies.`
` ...The Predecessor said to avoid brutal actions of that—"`
`When the witch stared at her with those terrifying eyes, Lucifer was struck dumb.`
`...She was unsatisfied.`
` She was bored, of not being able to let her own power and her own cruelty run wild.`
`......Irritated by her predecessor's furniture telling her to act with restraint, her discontent was at its peak.`
`"Oh, it's Lucifer‐chan the Proud.`
` Long time no see nyeh, how ya doin'?`
` Let's play together again sometime.`
` Nihhihihihihihi!"`
`"F‐...410, you mustn't chat, you'll get in trouble...!`
` Let us carry out the great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}'s order at once...!"`
`"Nihi.`
` Looks like we're on the job right now nyeh."`
`"......410, understood.`
` Preparing for sniping pursuit combat."`
`"Collecting terrain data, collecting firing data.`
` Data link to 410."`
`"410, data received.`
` Target acquired.`
` Correcting for terrain.`
` Forming firing curve, control points adjusted.`
` Data link to 45."`
`"45, data received.`
` Checking danger zone, ......ah, not there!"`
`"You're in the way behind us, Lucifer‐chan,`
` you'll get roasted in the backfire, you know? Nihi!"`
`".........nh..."`
`The Chiester sisters, through their mutual measurements,`
` were able to instantly calculate the terrain inside the mansion and the coordinates of their targets, as well as a firing curve to reach them.`
`...Yes, their shots could be guided to draw a curved line.`
`{n}No one would be able to escape it.`
`The precision homing ability of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory was nothing more than a cheap version of the ability these two held.`
`"45, firing preparations complete.`
` Ammo selected, now loading."`
`The two of them faced each other,`
` and, as though they were both pulling back a bowstring together,`
` ...there, a dazzling golden arrow was readied.`
`"410, nihi.`
` Firing."`
`After they proclaimed that they were firing, together, they released a single arrow.`
`As the curve taken by the gold‐sparkling snake of light drew a trail,`
` it headed in the direction Rudolf and Kyrie had run, in rapid pursuit.`
`It turned through the corridors, crawled over the floor, chasing them as it drew a beautiful curve.`
`No one could block the Chiester Sisters' homing projectiles.`
` No one could escape them.`
` And their strength could pierce all physical and magical defenses.`
`......It was an all‐too‐merciless guided weapon of certain death.`
`However, among mythical‐class soldiers, it was a weapon used by pretty much everyone.`
` It was very commonplace for them, ...and very extraordinary for those of the everyday world.`
`"Wh‐what the...?!"`
`When he noticed something rapidly chasing them, and turned around...`
`Rudolf was shot straight through the location of his heart by the gold snake.`
` It all happened in an instant.`
`"R‐Rudolf‐san......?!"`
`After the gold snake ran Rudolf through,`
` it swooped down to the floor, drawing a beautiful spiral, coiled itself around Kyrie's legs, and crawled up to her chest.`
`And just like Rudolf, it shot straight through the location of her heart.`
`...And all of that, too, happened in an instant.`
`{n}It impaled Rudolf, and it impaled Kyrie.`
`So they died at almost the same time, dropped to their knees at the same time, and fell over at the same time.`
`"......What is thiiis?`
` So overwhelming, ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!`
` That was ridiculously easy, wasn't it?`
` Kuhhihihya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hyahya!`
` This is the kind of furniture I need.`
` Way different from my predecessor's second‐hand furniture!"`
`"Come on, bring their corpses here.`
` I'll keep reviving them until I'm bored, and try killing them in the most brutal ways I can think of.`
` Aaah, to think that being a witch could be so much fun,`
` that taking a life could be so much fun, ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!"`
`......The most shunned action to take for someone born a human is the murder of another human.`
`It's only natural for a human not to understand how pleasurable it is to break this taboo.`
`......But she was no longer a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
`{n}She was a witch.`
`...And there were some pleasures that only witches could understand.`
`By now, she had tasted those pleasures, and was totally immersed in them.`
`...After learning that the contents of the forbidden pot were honey, she could no longer live without it.`
`......No, maybe the contents were honey because they were forbidden.`
`In any case, the act of killing {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s gruesomely,`
` and doing it over and over, was by now giving her a drug‐like pleasure.`
`As the witch rolled over laughing,`
` the gold snake which had just been fired returned as though being hauled back in.`
`The two were stitched at the tip and being dragged along.`
`The witch's order had been carried out.`
`...Rudolf and Kyrie had been killed instantly, and their bodies had been carried back.`
`"Chiester45, 410, execution of orders completed.`
` We await your next order, Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Please, your order...!"`
`"From babysitting, to playing you in online multiplayer,`
` to shooting down a space shuttle, we'll take care of everything.`
` Nihihi!"`
`"............These two are apparently the sacrifices for the fourth twilight and the fifth twilight.`
` So in the end, I need those worthless Seven Sisters,`
` ...oh, I guess they're the Five Sisters now.`
` I need those girls to pierce and gouge the forehead and the chest."`
`"......But I can do that at the very end, and I'm free to play in any way until then, right?`
` Eheheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh!"`
`"Wait wait wait waait.`
` ...Have you already forgotten what I told you?!"`
`"Oh, it's you, Predecessor‐sama.`
` Do you have any complaints?"`
`"Of course I do...!`
` You are doing as you please, are you not?!`
` Why can't you follow my directions?!"`
`"What's wrong with doing as I please, Predecessor‐sama?`
` And I haven't got the slightest desire to deviate from the rules of the ritual."`
`"I'll make sure to clean these two corpses up later, and drive stakes into their forehead and chest."`
`"I, I'm telling you, that is not the problem...!`
` If you act so undignified and cruel, uh,`
` ...umm, some people might take it badly..."`
`"..............................`
` ......You mean, your opponent in that game, who I heard you were fighting with somewhere?`
` Ronove told me."`
`"......C‐curse that blabbermouth.`
` .........Well, to be perfectly honest, that's how it is.`
` I had a complaint that, um,`
` ...it is a little too much, you see?"`
`"It's not like there's any need for them to tell you to pass it on instead of objecting directly to me.`
` ...That person is a coward."`
`".........Well, that person is a resident of, uh, a different world from this one, you see.`
` There's no choice but to use me as an intermediary.`
` Well, anyway, the point is—"`
`"........................`
` ......Which means that this person can't interact with me even if they wanted to.`
` And I can't interact with them even if I wanted to either.`
` Am I correct to understand this as an unrelated person from a world that far away?"`
`"M‐mm.`
` ......By analogy, perhaps you could say these worlds are like two very close parallel lines.`
` The worlds are very nearby, but since they are parallel lines, they will never cross.`
` For the time being, you may view that world in such a manner."`
`"They never cross.`
` Which means...`
`.........that world has nothing to do with me.`
` ...If you're telling me on behalf of that person to show some restraint, please pass this message on to them."`
`"A message?`
` What should I say...?"`
`"It's none of your business, so screw off, you old hag.`
` Why don't you just give up and die forever...?"`
`"..................Wha—"`
`"...Oh, I'm sorry.`
` Since it was a friend of yours, I just imagined that she'd be a woman.`
` By "old hag", I'm definitely not talking about youuu, Predecessor‐sama, so please forgive me.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`When she spoke, the witch was looking straight into Beato's eyes.`
`{n}...Anyone in that place would be able to figure it out just by looking.`
`"............Predecessor‐sama.`
` There is something I find very strange.`
` ...Why do you have to play a game with that person from another world,`
` and have them accept that you are a witch?"`
`"Well, about that,`
` ...that is because making all humans accept the existence of witches is related to perfect control.`
` There was a single holdout, you see, and he just won't accept me as a witch."`
`".........Why is it that you need that {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}'s approval?`
` Witches are witches, and they use magic; why do you need a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}'s acknowledgement for this?"`
`"...Mh, .........well, like I said earlier, that which is called magic is—"`
`"I am a witch.`
` I can use magic without anyone's approval in particular, so what's your point......?"`
`"In this world, right?`
` However, since he will not accept it, umm,`
` ...hmmmm, how should I explain it..."`
`"......I don't need an explanation.`
` After all, isn't this all about a different world that never crosses this one?`
` In other words, it's just as though that world doesn't exist."`
`"...............Whether you're fighting in a game in another world, or talking about your delusions, that doesn't change aaanything.`
` ......I'll say it again.`
` It has nothing to do with me.`
` And I am already a witch."`
`"Predecessor‐sama, somehow or another, it seems that you can't become a witch as long as this person doesn't accept you, but I'm different.`
` Even though no one has accepted me, I am already an excellent witch.`
` .........Since you are my predecessor, I will formally pay you respect,`
` but that is out of good will, not out of duty."`
`"......I do not seek your advice anymore,`
` and I understand clearly what I should do now and how I should play from now on."`
`".........So I will carry out the ceremonial murder of the thirteen people as a final act of respect for you.`
` However, as for the methods I use,`
` and what I do after that, there is absolutely no reason I should be lectured by you on those.`
` ..................Therefore, I'll be counting on you in that regard."`
`At a glance, those words seemed obedient, but they contained within them a clear parting of ways.`
`...They were saying, as clear as could be,`
` "I have no more reason to rely on you, so don't get in the way of my fun".`
`Beato understood that,`
` ...and was dejected, realizing that no matter how she explained it, she wouldn't be able to make the witch understand.`
`"...I, ............I see...`
` Then it is no longer my problem...`
` Go and learn first‐hand how magic ceases to exist when you lose your feelings of respect for it."`
`"......That carefree rampage of yours up until now,`
` I would dearly like to hear how it can be called respect."`
`After hearing that, Beato could not respond.`
` ......Because she remembered hearing exactly the same thing from her master.`
`"So.`
` Chiester Sisters?`
` My predecessor is just leaving, please see her off."`
`"Nihihihihi.`
` Predecessor‐sama, please retire from this place."`
`"I‐if you don't, we'll be scolded...!"`
`Throughout her body, Beato felt something invisible in the Chiester Sisters' eyes which could only be described as an oppressive feeling.`
`......Most likely, they were initiating firing calculations.`
`{n}It was an action much like taking out a gun and cocking it.`
`Even Beato could not escape from the Chiester Sisters' attacks without any preparation.`
`...In the past, she had placed her greatest trust in them, so she knew down to her very soul how terrifying they were.`
`".........Predecessor‐sama, if you would retire.`
` .........I would not recommend damaging {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's mood any further."`
`"......Predecessor‐sama..."`
`"A‐.........alright.`
` ...I shall now take my leave.`
` ......I shall take my time appreciating the circumstances you will put yourself in!"`
`That was as close as you could get to a loser's last retort.`
`...So after Beato hid herself, the witch and her furniture fell over laughing...`
`"............Well, I understand.`
` Endless power is fun.`
` ...The joy of freely toying with a life, the epitome of finite things, cannot be explained to those who have not tasted it.`
` ......I can understand the feeling of being possessed with that pleasure."`
`"......It must have been quite fun.`
` Judging from your antics in the past."`
`"Are you saying it is like how you used to admonish me in the past, Master, and I did not listen...?"`
`".........Why is it that you have started trying to scold that child for her actions?"`
`"Mh, ......umm, well.`
` ........................"`
`"...There is a single large difference between you and that child.`
` That child may already be a witch.`
` Of course, you are also a witch.`
` In the world on top of the game board."`
`"......However, to be accepted as a witch outside the game board,`
` you need to have your opponent in this game, Battler‐kun, accept you.`
` ......You must have understood that when you started the game."`
`"......I thought that if I could show off a whirlwind of proof that I am a witch,`
` blow away his feelings that made him deny me, and break him completely,`
` .........he would accept me as a witch.`
` ...It all went my way last time, so I thought I was just a breath away..."`
`"It's actually the opposite.`
` Battler‐kun was shocked by your brutality.`
` And the reason he stepped up as your opponent was not because he accepted you as an equal opponent.`
` It was based on a strong animosity, as he tried to completely deny the existence of a brutal witch."`
`".........In your foolishness, you probably felt that Battler‐kun considering himself as your opponent...`
`was a first step towards making him accept that you are a witch.`
` However, it was actually the exact opposite."`
`"Battler‐kun challenged you in this game because he definitely would not accept you as a witch.`
` ......No matter how much the thoughtless north wind blew, the traveler only wore his cloak even tighter.`
` You were committing a huge error from the very beginning."`
`"............This game is not torture to break Battler‐kun.`
` It is a test, in which you must work hard to make Battler‐kun accept you."`
`"...............`
` ...I,`
` ......I vaguely, you know,`
` ...realized that..."`
`"Last time, it was a tough game for Battler‐kun.`
` But it seems that you've already noticed.`
` ......This time, the game is tough for you."`
`"Wh‐...what should I do from now on?"`
`"Think about it yourself.`
` ......Fortunately, you have already abandoned being a piece on the game board, and relegated things to the new witch.`
` You should have time to deliberately ponder upon yourself."`
`"............But Battler's already a big ball of hostility.`
` He won't accept witches, and he won't accept me.`
` ......In that case, how do I make Battler accept me, then...?`
` Are you saying that if the north wind doesn't work, ...then I should shine on him as the sun from now on...?`
` {i:I} should, after all this time......?"`
`"It is October now.`
` The Halloween season.`
` .........It is the month of rebirth, when the sun dies and is revived again.`
` When the sun is weak right after reviving, it may pale in comparison to the cold winter winds."`
`"However, it slowly grows, and is eventually able to hail the coming of spring.`
` ...At that time, the traveler may even fold up his cloak."`
`".........So you say...`
`...that I am mistaken........."`
`...The beautiful hall of the Ushiromiya mansion was covered in a glow golden like gold leaf,`
` ...and stained deep red with thick spurts of blood.`
`The number of deaths given to Rudolf and Kyrie had long surpassed anything you could count on both your fingers and your toes.`
`The witch was breathing so hard her shoulders shook, but it wasn't because she was tired.`
`{n}...She just couldn't hide the ragged breathing caused by her still uncontainable excitement.`
`"Ahhahahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!`
` How fun it is to do as I will with the life and death of people!`
` Before the power of the Endless Witch, every one of the infinities I paint with my mind becomes reality!"`
`"No matter how {i:sloppily} I {i:mash} them,`
` I can revive them, returning them to normal with just a snap of my fingers."`
`"Because in the end, I just have to return the corpses to normal and make a token show of following the epitaph.`
` Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"......Hey, you guys,`
` have you ever sliced a stuffed animal's stomach open?"`
`"Never, nihi.`
` What about you, 45?"`
`"N‐no...!`
` I have never done it, my apologies...!"`
`"Of course not.`
` Normally, you wouldn't.`
` ......Especially not if it was a stuffed animal you liked.`
` But I've always thought about it."`
`"I wondered what was packed inside this fluffy stuffed animal that I loved so much,`
` and always thought I'd like to peek inside one day."`
`If you cut it and looked inside, your curiosity might be quelled, but the stuffed animal would be broken.`
`......So even though you want to see, you can't.`
`{n}You understand that feeling, right?`
`"......The power of the Endless Witch can grant exactly that wish.`
` ...As I am now, I can slice the stuffed animal all I want."`
`"......And yet, with a bit of magic, I can revive it back to normal.`
` ...In other words, it means that I have broken all limitations in this world.`
` ......As I am now, I don't have to hesitate, refrain, or anything of the sort."`
`"That joy, ......aah, there's probably no one who can understand it.`
` No one other than me, the Endless Witch!!"`
`As the witch let out a euphoric cry, she revived Rudolf and Kyrie again,`
` and faster than they could realize it, she killed them right away.`
`......As she made it known that something other than cotton was stuffed inside those two.`
`"...G‐`
`............give it a rest, Eva......!"`
`"Huh?`
` ......Ah, you.`
` You're here."`
`In that hall of tragedy, Hideyoshi showed himself, his gun readied.`
`The witch had sealed the mansion with a barrier, so Hideyoshi had nowhere to run.`
`...He had probably picked up Rudolf's or Kyrie's gun, and come back.`
`It seemed that the gun, which should have been something to be feared, was no longer an object she took seriously now that she was overflowing with magic power.`
`Her bold expression didn't flinch in the slightest.`
`".........Why'd you have to kill Rosa‐san and Maria‐chan,`
` ......and Rudolf‐kun and Kyrie‐san......?!"`
`"Huh?`
` I am the head of the Ushiromiya family, and the witch of Rokkenjima.`
` I am free to start whatever I like on this island.`
` ...Just isolating this one instant and asking about their life and death within it is meaningless to me."`
`Hideyoshi was struck speechless by that all‐too‐callous response from the witch.`
` Could someone's personality change so much just by finding Kinzo's gold......?`
`"Just how high was that gold piled?`
` I can't even imagine it.`
` It must have been enough to make you lose your sanity..."`
`"......Still, if there was that much gold,`
` ......why didn't you think of graciously splittin' it up...?!!"`
`"You misunderstand.`
` ............All of that belongs to the Golden Witch.`
` No one is qualified to touch it except for me.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*, ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!"`
`"......What are you?`
` Are you tryin' to say you're that thing Eva told me about long ago......the witch Eva from when she was young?"`
`"That's right.`
` I am me in my youth, who was always living in the heart of your wife, Ushiromiya Eva.`
` ...And I'm a witch.`
` .........Eva became an adult by forgetting me.`
` So she can't use magic."`
`"...Everyone fills their head sometimes with innocent yet cruel fantasies, as kids.`
` Even me, when I was young, I'd sometimes go around steppin' on ants and pullin' the wings off dragonflies.`
` .........But you learn the importance of life, and grow out of that cruel childhood age."`
`"......Right now, you really are a child, y'know!`
` ...A personality that Eva should have outgrown!`
` That's not Eva.`
` It's a different human!!"`
`"That's right.`
` I am not Ushiromiya Eva.`
` I'm the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"It's so fun, not being bounded by any limitations, and the pleasure of being able to do as I will with life and death is truly wonderful...!`
` I don't have to apologize for breaking the goldfish bowl,`
` and I can tear the stuffed animal as much as I want!`
` I—"`
`A dry sound.`
`...It was the sound of Hideyoshi slapping the witch's face.`
`By looking at the hall stained deep red with fresh blood, he should have been able to imagine how terrible the witch was.`
`But without fear, without even hesitating, Hideyoshi had walked determinedly up to her, and hit her on the cheek.`
`"....................."`
`"You dolt!!`
` Don't act like you're cruel, not when you're really a coward and a weaklin'!`
` I'll keep you on the straight and narrow, you wicked woman!!`
` You dumbo!`
` Nitwit!!"`
`"Ow,`
` ......ouch,`
` ...hey...!"`
`"You used to be a woman who understood how important, how fragile a life is!`
` I'll knock some sense back into you...!!`
` What's all this about witches, what a load of crock!!"`
`"You're my wife, Ushiromiya Eva!`
` A witch of the kitchen, thoughtfully whippin' up snacks from leftovers in the fridge, that's the only witch you are!!`
` Open your eyes, you blunderin' dolt...!!"`
`"Didn't I just say...`
`that I'm not Ushiromiya Eva......?!"`
`"That's horsecrap!!`
` You!`
` You!!"`
`As tears dripped down his face, Hideyoshi kept hitting the witch's head.`
`He wasn't even pointing the gun at her anymore.`
`So.`
` That sound of gunfire couldn't have come from the gun Hideyoshi was holding.`
`......The gun, which had fallen in the corner near Rudolf's body, was floating in the air,`
` ...and smoke lingered near the barrel.`
`And the bullet?`
` .........A red stain was slowly spreading across the chest of Hideyoshi's vest.`
`Even though his back was facing the barrel of the gun, ...the bullet was embedded in Hideyoshi's chest.`
`".........E...`
`va............`
` ............uu..."`
`"...I told you, I'm not Eva.`
` What a stupid, annoying man."`
`"......You're a pain, so I'll switch the sacrifice for the sixth twilight to you.`
` ...If you'd just stayed hidden under a bed quivering or something, I'd planned to let you go.`
` ......You deliberately came back.`
` You really are a stupid man."`
`Thunk...`
` There was a dull sound as Hideyoshi fell to the floor.`
`Even though he would be able to escape his pain by dying, he resisted that until the last second,`
` and staring straight into the witch's eyes, ...he passed away.`
`Because he had died without closing his eyes, for a short while, the witch didn't realize that he was dead,`
` and she remained pinned down by that gaze.`
`"Will we make this one a new toy and play?`
` Nihi."`
`At those words, the witch finally realized that Hideyoshi was dead.`
`".........nn, ...ahh.`
` ...Right, what'll we do..."`
`The Chiester Sisters waited for instructions.`
`{n}On the inside, they imagined an order even more brutal than before from their master.`
`But the expression that rose to the witch's face looked as though she had gotten over her excitement.`
`{n}She looked down at Hideyoshi's face, which still had tears dripping down it...`
`"......This guy totally ruined my mood.`
` Yeeeah, I'm done.`
` .........Ronove, you there?"`
`"Yes, right here."`
`"Clean up, please.`
` ...My predecessor will be annoying.`
` Please make it clean enough so that the old hag will accept it. ......And I guess I will follow the rules of the ritual, out of responsibility to my predecessor.`
` Please make these three corpses the fourth twilight through the sixth twilight."`
`"Lucifer, you're up."`
`"Lucifer the Proud, right here."`
`"Dig into these three corpses and gouge them."`
`"I‐...into the corpses?"`
`"That's right.`
` You have a problem with that?"`
`"N‐...no..."`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory had a modest sense of pride.`
` It was the pride of a hunter, the pride of gouging prey that they had brought down themselves.`
`...However, being told to gouge a corpse that someone else had brought down ran contrary to that feeling.`
` Of course, that was not the witch's intention, but for the Seven Sisters, it was horribly humiliating.`
`...However, they had already messed up, with two of the sisters defeated, so they had no right to question her.`
`Only Ronove appreciated that, and he rested his hand on her shoulder in understanding.`
`"......It is {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's order.`
` Lucifer, carry the three, and deal with them according to the protocol of the ritual.`
` Then, when you are done, lend me a hand with the cleanup."`
`"Certainly......"`
`The witch looked down upon Hideyoshi's corpse, as though implying that this somehow weird atmosphere was all Hideyoshi's fault.`
`".........Stupid man.`
` You didn't even have to die."`
`"Honey......!!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!`
` Honey, where are you?!`
` You're there, right?`
` Answer me!!"`
`The sound of a loud thunderbolt woke Eva from her nightmare.`
`If Hideyoshi had been gripping her hand at that time, her fearful heart would probably have been instantly healed.`
`However, Hideyoshi, who had sworn that he wouldn't leave even for a moment, was nowhere to be seen in the room.`
`"Honey,`
` ...answer me...`
` .........Honey...!!`
` Uuuuuhhuuu{0}uuughhhuu!!"`
