`......The adults' motivations aside...`
`{n}At least for us kids,`
` these were supposed to be a fun couple of days where we cousins deepened our friendship.`
`However, when we woke up, there was an unbelievably cruel reality waiting for us...`
`"............hic, ......hic......!"`
`"................................."`
`George‐aniki and Jessica were crying over Shannon‐chan and Kanon‐kun's deaths.`
`......Right now, everyone who was alive was gathered in the lobby on the first floor of the guesthouse.`
` And there were 12 of us.`
`...Unbelievable, right?`
`{n}There were 18 up until yesterday.`
`{n}...And in one night, a third of that number had lost their lives...`
`My agitation had finally settled down, and, along with my lack of sleep from being woken up so early in the morning,`
` I was beginning to feel like this was just a little unreal.`
`......I want to think this is some kind of bad dream...`
` My cheap escapism kept telling me that was true, over and over.`
`Maria had gone back to sleep in the sofa Auntie Rosa was sitting in.`
`...Rather than her having nerves of steel, she probably genuinely hadn't had enough sleep.`
`The adults were grasping members of Grandfather's collection...`
`of short‐barrel rifles.`
`...Apparently a remnant from the period when he was obsessed by westerns, there were four identical guns altogether.`
`Those had been split up between the four siblings: Uncle Krauss, Auntie Eva, my dad, and Auntie Rosa.`
`Paper boxes filled with bullets lay on the table, and the siblings were silently loading their guns.`
`".........It's a little scary.`
` Even as I stand here touching this,`
` I get the feeling Dad's about to yell "Don't touch that!" and hit me."`
`"Then aren't you lucky.`
` ...No matter how much you touch it, you won't be hit again."`
`"............I can't believe it.`
` ...That Father...`
`.........would meet this kind of end..."`
`"I did think that when it came to Kinzo‐san, he would probably not die normally in his bed,`
` ......but even so, ......it is too horrible..."`
`"Hey.`
` I wonder if that really is Father...?`
` I'm suspecting that it might be a different person's corpse as a substitute to trick us..."`
`"......No, without a doubt, that is Father.`
` You saw his toes, right?`
` In general society, there aren't many humans with six toes on both feet."`
`"But, ............we can't say that there are none.`
` I've heard that polydactyly isn't a rare disease.`
` He was a man who liked big tricks, right?`
` ......He might have prepared a body from somewhere that had the same number of toes on both feet."`
`"Preposterous.`
` What would possess him to do something like that...?!"`
`"......I'd agree if it was a normal person.`
` ...But this is Father we're talkin' about.`
` You can't say for sure that what Kyrie‐san says is nonsense."`
`"............They say it's difficult to confirm the identity of a burnt corpse.`
` However, there should be various ways to examine him from his teeth and his bone structure.`
` If the police investigated, they'd be bound to know whose body it was in an instant."`
`"The problem is that before the police, we need a telephone engineer."`
`"......The boat probably won't come in this typhoon.`
` ...So, will it come tomorrow?"`
`"I expect that the boat will come again at nine o'clock tomorrow.`
` Then, I believe we will be able to contact the police."`
`"......Both us,`
` and the culprit...`
`have been imprisoned on this island, then, until the typhoon passes."`
`.........Just from our parents' conversation, you could probably figure out the general gist, but let's explain the situation anyway.`
`First, early that morning.`
`In various places throughout the mansion, a total of six corpses, of Grandfather and all the servants, had been found one after another.`
`First, Grandfather had been fed to the flames in the boiler room, and was completely burnt.`
`The servants were found dead, each locked in one of the various rooms throughout the mansion onto which magic circles had been drawn.`
`The cause of death for the servants was uncertain,`
` but according to Doctor Nanjo's diagnosis, there was a high likelihood that they had been stabbed by something like a spear,`
` ......or possibly shot by a gun.`
`That was why the adults had started arming themselves with the rifles.`
`And what made the situation even more chaotic was that the telephone lines were out of order.`
` It was unknown whether lightning had caused them to break down or whether the culprit had destroyed them.`
`In any case, contact with the outside was broken off, and we couldn't contact the police.`
`So until tomorrow morning, when the typhoon would pass and the boat would come,`
` we would have to protect ourselves.`
`After all, Rokkenjima was now isolated by the typhoon.`
` And just like how we were stuck on the island, so was the culprit.`
`It seemed that the adults had stayed up the whole night, spending the whole time holding the family conference in the mansion's dining hall.`
` And even so, this crime had occurred in the mansion.`
`......So right when the adults had been getting worked into a frenzy over money,`
` the murderer had been killing under the same roof...`
`Aunt Natsuhi said that they were strict on locking the doors and windows at night.`
`{n}And yet, some suspicious person had entered the mansion.`
`...The adults had decided that the inside of the mansion was too large to be safe,`
` so they had pulled out the guns and moved to the guesthouse, where we had been.`
`.........Which brings us to the present.`
`George‐aniki and us others begged to see Shannon‐chan's body,`
` but the adults refused point blank, saying that we must not until the police arrive.`
`That wasn't just because they had sealed all the rooms to preserve the scene.`
`...After all, the culprit who had killed six people had wandered about that mansion.`
`To the Ushiromiya family right now, the mansion which should have been their home...`
`was like a danger zone that an unknown murderer had entered...`
`It makes sense, I mean, the mansion is vast.`
` There are plenty of blind spots and dark places, and it's just too vast to guarantee absolute safety with this number of people.`
`In contrast, the guesthouse is a much smaller building than the mansion.`
`Two stories tall.`
` Number of rooms...about ten?`
`{n}......Apparently, it had originally been constructed to serve as a boarding house for when the island was to be turned into a resort.`
`So it's easy to grasp the entire structure, and easy to guarantee safety.`
`{n}That makes it a good place to hole up in.`
`......And.`
` There's an extremely high likelihood that this mass murder of six people is a "game".`
`Because the culprit had proclaimed that in a letter.`
`I heard that a Western‐style envelope with the family crest, just like the one Maria claimed to have received from {f:5:Beatrice} yesterday,`
` had been found in the boiler room where Grandfather's corpse had been discovered.`
`This was what the letter said:`
`{e:070:So that there will be no misunderstandings.`
`{n}The game I seek is whether or not you can solve the riddle of the epitaph,`
` not whether or not you can catch me.`
`{n}{n}If you do not solve the riddle of the epitaph, the pitiful sacrifices will further increase in number.`
`{n}It would be more wise to spend your time solving the epitaph than searching for me.`
`{n}{n}If no one can solve the riddle of the epitaph, no one will survive.}`
`{e:070:If a person appears with skill enough to solve the riddle of the epitaph, I will give them all the gold of the Golden Land,`
` the Ushiromiya family headship, and all of my power.`
`{n}{n}I was the one who succeeded the Ushiromiya family headship from Kinzo‐sama.`
`{n}And I look forward to seeing who will receive the headship from me.`
`{n}{n}{nobreak:{m:-3:—}—}{f:5:Beatrice} the Golden.}`
`...This riddle of the epitaph was...that thing.`
`That strange epitaph written in the same place as the portrait of the witch, displayed in the hall of the mansion.`
`Grandfather was the one who ordered that it be written,`
` and the person who solved it would, supposedly, be given the family headship or the hidden gold or something like that.`
`Ever since it was first displayed there several years ago, all the relatives, despite making fun of it in the open,`
` had been secretly been challenging that riddle in private.`
`However, up until today, no one had solved it.`
` We had once again been told to solve that unintelligible riddle, and this time, we had been threatened that if we didn't solve it, we would all be killed.`
`......If this wasn't a "game", what would you call it...`
`The bold opinion that we should search the premises for the culprit did come up once.`
`However, there was a good chance they were armed, and there wasn't necessarily only one of them.`
`And, ...while they might have been able to kill more than six people, they had {i:stopped at six}.`
`In the end, the opinion that we should avoid carelessly antagonizing the culprit,`
` and hole up in a safe place while we waited for the police to arrive, won out...`
`After the adults had carefully checked that the doors and windows in the guesthouse were locked, they set up camp in the lobby.`
`And as they fingered their guns to distract themselves from the tension,`
` their expressions showed that they were already fatigued from this long day, which had still barely begun...`
`There was nothing that I could do.`
`Now, all I could do was be taught how to use a gun,`
` to prepare for the off‐chance that...something would happen which {i:led to an excess of guns}......`
`......That's the way.`
` Just obediently stay there, {i:me and the rest of you}.`
`"...............Six people in the beginning again.`
` And this time it's Grandfather and all of the servants put together."`
`"Most likely,`
` that child has carefully studied your moves from the last game.`
` And she placed the highest priority upon taking the pieces which she guessed you were most likely to first suspect."`
`"......That makes sense.`
` ...Both last time, and the time before that,`
` the servants who know everything about the mansion and who walk around with master keys were always highest on the list of suspicious people."`
`"......A good example in the last game is Jessica's locked room.`
` If I had only accepted that a servant was the culprit, that wouldn't even have been a locked room."`
`"Therefore,`
` ......that child went straight for them.`
` She probably immediately went to block the way of escape that you would ultimately retreat into."`
`"Beato already proclaimed in red that there are no more than 18 people on this island.`
` ...So basically,`
` .........{i:she's saying "give it up"}.`
` ......Now I have to suspect one of the 18."`
`"......That child will probably come at you by stealing the pieces for the 18, and descending as a 19th person who shouldn't exist,`
` thereby making you accept that she is a witch."`
`"......That is because now that her intimidation strategy of trying to force you to submit by showing you magic has failed,`
` she can only make a frontal attack."`
`"......Perfect.`
` Bluffing won't work anymore."`
`"Be careful.`
` Deception is a witch's strongest point.`
` ...No matter what that child says or shows you,`
` it definitely won't threaten the truth that you believe in.`
` Don't forget that."`
`".........Sure.`
` I'll be damned if the same moves are going to work on me over and over.`
` .........Get out here, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Let's get started!!!"`
`"I am already seated at the match table.`
` My turn, too, is already complete."`
`"......Imagine that Madam would turn out to be our enemy.`
` How unfortunate, Milady.`
` ...Our moves will be read thoroughly."`
`"That is no problem.`
` Master's moves are all outdated classics.`
` There is nothing to fear."`
`"...What moves can you make beyond the classics I taught you?`
` I am looking forward to seeing, {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` Is that alright, Battleerr?`
` If a person who denies witches such as yourself accepts a witch as a strategist..."`
`"That stupid provocation is useless.`
` This person is my advisor, no, my second.`
` That doesn't change one bit that this is a fistfight between you and me."`
`"I understand.`
` ......You're so wobbly that you probably need training wheels on your bicycle.`
` Do as you like.`
` Come, begin!!`
` It is your turn!"`
`"Let's begin with the reconstruction of the crime scene.`
` ......{f:5:Virgilia}, if you please!"`
`"The first body discovered was Shannon's.`
` She was found in the parlor on the first floor of the mansion.`
` The door and windows were locked, and a locked room was established."`
`"......Clarification request for Beato.`
` Reconfirm the definition of a locked room."`
`"Mmhm.`
` The term "locked room" refers to a room where the inside and the outside of the room are completely isolated from all travel between them.`
` Of course, no form of intrusion or escape, nor even any interference is possible.`
` That is comprehensive, including a denial of hidden doors, as well as all margin for interference from the outside."`
`"......Henceforth, this definition will be referred to as:`
` "{f:5:Beatrice}'s locked‐room definition"!"`
`"Confirming specifics.`
` ......Define "margin for interference from the outside"."`
`"It refers to all types of direct interference from the outside, such as using a fishing line or a long, thin rod.`
` In other words, you are to conclude that there is not even any gap in the doors or windows by which to use such tricks."`
`"I wonder about that?`
` Even if there wasn't a gap, you should be able to interfere with radio waves, like with a remote control, right?"`
`"Very well.`
` I add to this definition that it is impossible for radio waves and related methods of remote control to interfere."`
`"There's also an extension telephone in the parlor.`
` A device linked with that wouldn't count as remote control, right?!"`
`"The phones are already out of order, damn you.`
` ...Ugh, this is a pain.`
` I'll include that too.`
` All direct and indirect methods of interfering from the outside of the room to the inside of the locked room are impossible."`
`"What about a voice or a knock?`
` Those should be able to interfere from the outside without entering the room, right?"`
`".........Even though it is a locked room, it probably isn't impossible for someone to knock or call out.`
` Whether the room allows for human communication with the outside or not, it does not go against the definition of a locked room."`
`"In other words, you can't define it so that even methods of communication are interrupted?"`
`"That is the case."`
`"Understood.`
` .........So, Shannon‐chan's parlor satisfies "{f:5:Beatrice}'s locked‐room definition"?"`
`"That is correct."`
`".........Locked‐room definition understood.`
` Continue, {f:5:Virgilia}."`
`"Yes."`
`".........Shannon's body was in possession of one master key.`
` The relatives who discovered her collected this."`
`"Repetition request for Beato.`
` How many master keys this time?"`
`"...Hmph. The same as last time.`
` {p:1:There are five, one for each servant}."`
`"Which means this still isn't a locked room.`
` There are still four master keys left.`
` It just means that after Shannon‐chan was murdered, one of the other four keys locked it."`
`"That is correct.`
` .........And, it wasn't only a master key that was found."`
`"Yes."`
`"......Alongside the body, there was a Western envelope with the family crest.`
` Instead of a letter, the key to the second‐floor guest room was inside it."`
`"......The key to the second‐floor guest room...`
` Am I fine to define that as the only key other than the master keys that can open the door to the second‐floor guest room?"`
`"Indeed. There is no problem.`
` And, unlike the master keys, there is only one."`
`"In other words, in order to unlock a specific room, in addition to the five master keys,`
` there is only one other key."`
`"......In other words, this is a message telling them to go to the second‐floor guest room next?`
` So the adults moved to the second‐floor guest room?"`
`"Yes."`
`"The door to the second‐floor guest room was also locked, and a magic circle was drawn on it.`
` ......The relatives unlocked it with the key they had found near Shannon's body."`
`"Inside the room, Kumasawa's body was discovered.`
` The room was a locked room.`
` That definition is based upon "{f:5:Beatrice}'s locked‐room definition"."`
`".........Kumasawa was in possession of one master key.`
` The relatives collected this."`
`"And like Shannon, there was a Western envelope discovered alongside her.`
` Inside was the key to the third‐floor servants' quarters.`
` The relatives moved to the third‐floor servants' quarters."`
`"And there was a magic circle on the door to the third‐floor servants' quarters, and that door was locked?"`
`"Yes."`
`"Inside the room, Gohda's body was discovered.`
` The room was a locked room.`
` Based on "{f:5:Beatrice}'s locked‐room definition"."`
`"Gohda was in possession of one master key.`
` The relatives collected this."`
`"And just as before, a Western envelope with a family seal was discovered.`
` Inside was the key to the second‐floor VIP room.`
` The relatives moved to the second‐floor VIP room."`
`".........What is all of this...?`
` What the hell are you planning...?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` It isn't something worth glaring at me over, is it?`
` It is a locked room, but there are still several master keys that can open it, correct?`
` And I have even been dutiful enough to present you with the keys particular to each room in addition to the master keys."`
`"......I don't like how this is going.`
` ......But I'm starting to see how things will turn out.`
` So it continues like this for all six people?"`
`"Yes, that is correct.`
` Inside the second‐floor VIP room, Genji's body was discovered."`
`"One master key was collected.`
` The key to the underground boiler room was discovered."`
`"They moved to the underground boiler room.`
` Inside the underground boiler room, Kinzo's body was discovered."`
`"The key to the chapel was discovered."`
`"They moved to the chapel."`
`"Inside the chapel, Kanon's body was discovered.`
` One master key was collected.`
` The key to the first‐floor parlor was discovered.`
` ......With this, our reconstruction of how all six bodies were discovered is complete."`
`"A supplement.`
` Along with the key to the chapel, a letter was enclosed in the Western envelope found near Kinzo's body.`
` The contents of the letter were as you saw.`
` It further urged the relatives to solve the epitaph's riddle."`
`".........In that case...`
` ...What's going on?`
` If the last place, where Kanon‐kun was, had the key to the very first room, the parlor, where Shannon‐chan was...`
` That makes six locked rooms, all tied together, right?"`
`"That is correct!`
` The six locked rooms are all tied together.`
` The keys to unlock each are all shut up inside the next room."`
`"In other words, the six locked rooms form one massive locked room,`
` and all of the master keys as well as the individual room keys are shut up inside it...!"`
`"`
`{p:1:Furthermore, all of the doors and windows in the six rooms are normal}.`
` {p:1:No device exists which can lock them without a key, such as an auto‐lock}.`
` *cackle*cackle*, what do you think, it's beautiful, isn't iiiiiiiiiiiit??? Uhhyahhyahhyaaahh!"`
`"As I said, Milady, that is not dignified."`
`When Ronove rebuked her, Beato stuck her tongue at him shamelessly.`
`"Uhihihi, sorry, sorry.`
` I just get in such a good mood playing with Battler."`
`"*cackle*, so, Battlerr?`
` What is your move going to be?`
` If you can't think of anything in particular, I can show you how I made the goats carry the bodies,`
` and sealed all of the rooms with magic, if you waaaaant?"`
`"Do what you want.`
` I'll listen respectfully to this "magic theory" that you assert.`
` However, I can assert my "human theory", which is completely different from your claim,`
` without any interference from your claim whatsoever."`
`"So, in other words!`
` There's no need for me to listen to your bullshit!!`
` Go wave your magic staff or whatever as much as you like and act out how you lock the door with your seven‐colored magic.`
` And before long, I'm sure there'll be people along to stand beside you, advertising their snake oil and all‐purpose kitchen knives!"`
`"{f:5:Virgilia}, reconstruct the crime scene!`
` I'll search for a weakness!!`
` Were they all definitely dead?`
` If one of them is just playing dead, this isn't a locked room at all!"`
`"Nanjo checked that all of them were dead.`
` However, due to the "Devil's Proof", it is impossible to deny the possibility of a wrong diagnosis.`
` ......In other words, she cannot make the likelihood that Nanjo overlooked the fact that they were alive equal to zero."`
`"Here it is, that "Devil's Proof".`
` But there exists a sword which can carve that up...!"`
`"Wh‐what are those people doing?`
` ......Looks like they're having a good time leaving me out of the discussion.`
` I am their opponent, right...?`
` They could pay attention to me at least a little..."`
`"By nature, communication with the opponent is not necessary in order to compete in chess."`
`"......You spoke in riddles when you communicated outside your moves, Milady.`
` ...Perhaps it has come to this because he does not want to be led astray."`
`"...............muu.`
` ......For some reason, I can't accept it."`
`"You are challenging him to a chess match, are you not, Milady?"`
`"That's true, but...`
`...muu!"`
`{f:5:Beatrice} puffed out her cheeks, as though saying "I don't know why, but I don't like it!"`
`"Because the police have not yet arrived at the scene, the human side's ability to prove things is limited.`
` For a strict confirmation of death, I recommend a repetition request."`
`"Alright, that's where I'll strike, repetition requested!!"`
`"‘The six victims are all dead’!!"`
`"......Milady, you have a repetition request waiting, you know?"`
`"Hey, enough lazing around!!`
` Do you decline the repetition?!`
` This is where our battle starts!!"`
`"Wha?!`
` Owowowowoow!!`
` *cackle*cackle*, sorry, sorry, that's fine, I'll respond."`
`"`
`{p:1:Kinzo, Genji, Shannon, Kanon, Gohda, and Kumasawa—these six are all dead}!"`
`"Why are you so out of it?`
` ...Alright.`
` So I've drawn one out of you.`
` That classic where they're pretending to be dead is the first to be denied."`
`"*cackle*!`
` I won't go easy on you anymore, come at me how you like.`
` I'll slice them slantwise one after another!"`
`"And again, repetition requested!`
` No one is hiding in any of the six rooms!`
` Show me that you can deny the existence of people we aren't aware of!"`
`"I'll respond."`
`"`
`{p:1:There is no one hiding in the six rooms}!"`
`"Alright.`
` Now I'm sure that it's only the six of them canned in there.`
` And they aren't pretending to be dead."`
`"......What will you do, what will you dooo?`
` There's already nothing a human could do.`
` Obediently kneel and observe as I control the locks at will with my wonderful magic, alriiiiiiight?"`
`"Quit babbling.`
` And another repetition request.`
` "The six deaths were instant"!"`
`"Instant death?`
` Hoh, what do you mean by that?"`
`"......It means there is a possibility that a single victim on the verge of death managed to escape into the room,`
` and after locking it from the inside to create a locked room, they passed away."`
`"...Hm.`
` A classic locked‐room murder.`
` In the case that the victim is dealt a fatal wound, and is doomed to die at some later time,`
` it is possible for the victim to hole up inside a room to escape the murderer,`
` and then die after locking it, in which case a locked room could be constructed unexpectedly."`
`"In order to deny that possibility,`
` you will need to proclaim that "the six died instantly" with the red truth."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Very well, very well, I'll slay you with my red treasured sword!"`
`"`
`{p:1:The six died instantly}!`
` By instant death, I mean that as soon as they were attacked, they became incapable of action."`
`"Well, death in its full meaning may have taken several seconds or even minutes.`
` But in any event, it was completely impossible for them to take any action of their own will.`
` In that sense, I can state that they died instantly!"`
`"...Everything up until now has just been checking for a classic locked room.`
` My showdown with you over the locked rooms starts now, alright...?`
` If the culprit isn't on the inside, they are on the outside.`
` So they somehow killed them from outside the rooms."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Have you lost your mind?`
` Isn't it true that "a locked room = murder is impossible from the outside"?!`
` Therefore, it's impossible for it to be anything other than a magical murder!"`
`"No, that's wrong.`
` The right thing to say is "a murder really happened = it isn't a locked room"!`
` No matter how much you speak in riddles, this definitely isn't a locked room!`
` It's a sham that only looks like a locked room!"`
`"However, Battler‐sama.`
` {p:1:Only the victims are inside the rooms,}`
` {p:1:and no other people exist inside the rooms}.`
` And by Milady's locked‐room definition,`
` remote murders from outside the room have been clearly denied, have they not?"`
`"Wait.`
` The definition of remote murders is vast, right?`
` Sure, there's stuff like pulling a fishing line from outside the room and strangling the victim inside the room,`
` but that's not all there is."`
`"For example......`
`a trap would make for an excellent remote murder!"`
`"A traap?`
` Hoh, what is that?!"`
`"Just as an example, let's say they were instructed to enter previously decided rooms,`
` and lock the doors from the inside to create a locked room themselves.`
` A trap is set up in those rooms that they don't know about,`
` and they are killed by that.`
` ......How's that?! Now there is no contradiction!"`
`"......There is no problem.`
` It corresponds to the existing state."`
`"...There is no problem on our side either.`
` It does not conflict with Milady's locked‐room definition."`
`"Kuhhahhahahahahahahahaha?!`
` What's with that stupid reasoning?!`
` Nothing suspicious was found in any of the rooms, you know?"`
`"What form did that trap have?!`
` Where was it hidden and how did it operate?!`
` Explain that for all six people, in the parlor, the guest room, the servants' quarters, the VIP room, the boiler room, and the chapel.`
` Well? You can't, can you?!?!"`
`"Decline refutation!!`
` There is no need for me to explain that!!`
` And even so, it doesn't damage my claim!!"`
`"Wh‐what did you saaaaaaaaayy...?!?!"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}, it is a "Devil's Proof".`
` The fact that he cannot explain the form of the trap...`
`does not in itself disprove that there was a trap!"`
`"............Well done.`
` While overbearing, a wonderful move."`
`"...Kh!!!`
` This guy is getting completely used to this......!!"`
`"Check.`
` It is possible to establish this locked‐room murder via a murder trap X that they couldn't find."`
`"......I‐I'll kill that check with the red truth!!"`
`"`
`{p:1:The six were not killed by traps}!"`
`"The definition of trap?!"`
`"Oh...`
`umm...`
`one of those!`
` Something that activates when a victim gets caught in it by their own actions."`
`"Aaah... That's not all!`
` Stuff that activates by remote control or by a timer,`
` ......everything like that is also included!"`
`"Pu ku ku...`
` All devices that can carry out a murder without the direct participation of the person who set it up.`
` I believe that definition may be appropriate."`
`"H‐how's that?!`
` I've struck back!!`
` As though I could let a human defeat this locked room!!"`
`"..................`
` ............You're also frantic, trying to win, huh."`
`"...Whaat...?!`
` What do you mean...?"`
`"......You're also frantically fighting to make me accept that you exist.`
` Until now, I thought that I was just being toyed around with one‐sidedly by you."`
`"...But that was actually wrong.`
` You're also frantically resisting my comeback, fighting to show that you exist...!`
` Now,`
` ...I finally really feel that's true."`
`This isn't torture inflicted on me about whether I'll submit or not.`
`"This is a fight between you and me on an even footing!!"`
`"......Alright, it's starting to get interesting, isn't it?`
` Six people died in locked rooms, and no one else was inside.`
` And there was no meddling from the outside, and also no traps.`
` If I was still how I used to be, I would probably think this had to be the work of magic."`
`"......And if you had acted out some strange magic right about now, I'd probably even have surrendered.`
` .........It's that favorite strategy of yours."`
`"...You completely intercept all of my moves, and in the moment that I've tried everything and fallen to my knees,`
` when my heart's defensive power is at its weakest, you show off some strange magic and take the game all at once!!"`
`".........She has always had a short temper.`
` She still has that bad habit of rushing things when victory is in sight."`
`"Pu ku ku.`
` Because Milady cannot stand putting things off."`
`"Heeey, shut up, shut up!!"`
`"It is your turn, Battler!`
` The "trap piece" that you advanced, I have cut down with red!`
` What will you send out next?`
` Show me what you've got!!"`
`"Right!!`
` Now that even traps have been defeated, at a glance, this looks like a perfect locked‐room murder.`
` ......And that's why this is where I'll flip over the chessboard!!"`
`"...Here it is, your special technique!`
` What exactly are you going to flip over, and how?!`
` Try showing meeeeeeeeeeee!!"`
`"Yeah, I'll show you!!`
` It's not about thinking how to kill six people inside locked rooms from the outside!"`
`"Yeah, that's no good, no good, no goddamn good at all!`
` That's right, it's not about how to kill from the outside.`
` It's about how they died inside the room and created a locked room!"`
`"......That's it, this is the answer!!`
` If you assume that one of the six victims was the culprit,`
` this locked room can be explained extremely easily!"`
`"Wh‐whaaaaaaat?!`
` No way!`
` I believe I clearly said in red that the six of them were dead......!!"`
`"Six people did die.`
` Five were victims who were killed.`
` If you assume that the other person committed suicide, you can destroy this locked room!!"`
`"......Certainly.`
` If the culprit locked themselves in the final locked room,`
` and threw away their own life, this locked‐room chain would be established."`
`"The culprit's suicide.`
` ...Normally, it is an unthinkable move,`
` but the argument that it doesn't exist because it is unthinkable,`
` doesn't exist.`
` ......And he has no responsibility to demonstrate a motive.`
` A truly powerful move, which can only be used in a chess match against a witch...!"`
`"......Well, you cannot say for certain that there is no motive.`
` ...For example, Kinzo had been pronounced as having only a short time left to live.`
` The motive of using his own death as a message, not being afraid to lose his short remaining life,`
` ...may not be impossible to attach."`
`".........Milady.`
` It is our turn."`
`"H‐...hmm!`
` To imagine that you would even trample on the dignity of the dead to create a culprit...!`
` What a heartless, cold‐blooded man...!"`
`"Setting up the dead as the culprit.`
` ...This move is worse than inhuman, and it's one you used to attack Kanon‐kun in the last game.`
` ......I'm taking a shot back at you with this move,`
` as a tribute to Kanon‐kun for that time, even though the games are different."`
`"Just now, I have freed that Kanon‐kun from his regrets!!"`
`"Ku......kuuuuuuu......!!"`
`"You have no duty to hold back here.`
` You should check whether suicide was not the cause of death for any of them.`
` I recommend requesting a repetition."`
`"Right!!`
` But suicide is a naive word that won't corner her!!`
` Beato, this is the end!!"`
`"Repetition requested!!`
` "The six deaths were all homicides"!!"`
`".....................That is painful."`
`"Uguu...!!`
` ........................kh...ooohh...!"`
`"Hmmmm?`
` What's wrong, six people were killed, right?!`
` I'm just checking the simplest premise we had at the very beginning, aren't I?`
` Can't you repeat it?!"`
`"I......I decline to repeat.`
` ...Th‐there's no reason in particular."`
`"Refusing to repeat this is the same as resigning, you know?!"`
`"Checkmate!!`
` One of the six was the culprit, and they carried out a suicide after constructing the locked room!`
` We're done!!"`
`"...W‐wait!`
` No, umm, ......I'll say it, I'll say it!`
` I'll use the red like you want!`
` {p:1:None of the six committed suicide}!"`
`"How's that?!`
` Are you satisfied...?!`
` *cackle*cackle*, kakkakakakaka!`
` I've struck back, I've struck back!!!"`
`"Heh,`
` ......what the hell, so you can say it...`
` ...But isn't that weird?`
` Why are you so panicked...?"`
`"......I‐i‐it's your imagination.`
` I am also frantic this time, you see?`
` I don't have much leeway.`
` Don't pay it any mind..."`
`"......The repetition you requested has been modified.`
` Do not be fooled."`
`"..................kuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu..."`
`"Pu ku ku ku...`
` It seems it was useless, Milady."`
`"Th‐that's right!`
` She didn't say "the six deaths were all homicides".`
` She changed it to "none of the six committed suicide"!`
` Which means that one or more of the people was not killed by someone else and didn't commit suicide."`
`".........Aaaaaaaahhh,`
` I've got it, I've got it!!`
` This is the truth!"`
`"After culprit X, who lurks among the six, murdered the other five, they constructed a locked room.`
` ......Then they planned to escape from or hide in that room by some method."`
`"However, {i:there was an accident}!!`
` The culprit died from an accident that even they hadn't expected, and constructed a locked room that even they hadn't desired!!`
` Now it's over, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` Checkmate!!!"`
`"D......damn iiiit!!`
` Did you think I would be cornered by something like that!!`
` I would never scream my resignation over something like that!!"`
`"I'll slice up that foolish checkmate with my red treasured sword over and over again!!`
` Among the six, there were n—"`
`"Mgmf?!`
` Fugagaga, wha are you ooing, fugafuga!"`
`"My apologies.`
` Our side requests some time to strategize.`
` Please allow us a brief postponement."`
`"......It is a just request.`
` I believe there should be no problem."`
`"Sure!! I'll allow that!`
` I've been given those a lot lately.`
` This time it's your turn to use it...!!"`
`"Thank you very much.`
` Come, Milady, ......this way.`
` And let us quietly count to one hundred inside our heads."`
`"Fugafugafuga!!`
` Hunoheh, huhnoheee!!`
` Fugaa!"`
`As Beato grew thoroughly panicked and agitated, Ronove had quickly covered her mouth with his hand, and suspended the game.`
`He then pulled Beato away in the name of a strategy conference...`
`"......Damn.`
` Curse that demon butler.`
` When Beato got all hot, that was an ideal chance to corner her..."`
`Beato normally behaves elegantly, but she actually has a really short temper and gets mad easily.`
`......Her normal intelligence falls silent when she starts getting agitated.`
`"Ronove is composed.`
` ...He probably gave that child some time to cool her head.`
` ......That child was stubbornly trying to remove your check,`
` and was going to easily let several large pieces go.`
` ...After all, the first twilight is only a skirmish.`
` ......That child mistook her timing."`
`"......So, what does it mean?`
` Did I create a checkmate, or didn't I?"`
`"That child was going to proclaim it in red.`
` It probably wouldn't have become checkmate yet.`
` ......But, I imagine,`
` that child will proclaim her resignation once she has cooled her head."`
`"...Surely not.`
` Even though she hates losing...?"`
`"Yes.`
` In a losing battle, it is essential to withdraw your troops as soon as possible to try to minimize your losses.`
` ......The difficult part is measuring whether it is a losing battle or not.`
` ...It seems that that child's butler calmly made that decision."`
`"......Oh well.`
` In other words, she got away with only a second to spare.`
` ......Looks like...`
`I won't be getting checkmate and delivering the final blow so easily."`
`"However, you should measure this as your victory.`
` They seem to have just barely prevented a large loss,`
` but without a doubt, you dealt considerable damage.`
` ......I am sure you were able to understand well the depths of that wound by watching the way she panicked."`
`"Seriously.`
` Ihihihi, it feels like she'd start crying if I bullied her any more than this."`
`As we talked, Ronove returned with Beato, who wore a meek expression.`
`...She didn't have the same bold smile as usual, but it looked like the blood wasn't rushing to her head anymore.`
`".........Hey.`
` It's your turn.`
` Did you decide your next move?"`
`"I resign.`
` ......For now, I will let you have your victory."`
`Beato told me that frankly.`
`{n}It seemed as though she had taken a far‐sighted view, as though saying "if you want to laugh, then laugh".`
`......It was a bit of a buzzkill, and I lost my desire to attack her further.`
`"Well, now that you've resigned, in the end,`
` all that means is that we're even, since my theory and yours can't deny each other.`
` I'll treat it more like a tie than a loss."`
`"......I don't need your disgusting compassion.`
` I say that this time, it is my loss.`
` ...When you find a dog drenched with rain, are you inclined to whack it with a stick or something?"`
`"Nope.`
` Unlike you."`
`".............................."`
`Even though she ridiculed me horribly when I showed signs of defeat, she was so pathetic when it was her turn.`
`I thought of her as a pretty unfair person, but I decided to act with dignity as a winner and accepted it.`
`......Beato had resigned.`
`{n}That was the only result of the first twilight.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} couldn't counter my move of "one of the six was the culprit,`
` and that person died in an accident".`
`...No, she probably could have countered it, but because of some strategic decision, she had given up.`
`I felt less like I had won, and more like she had escaped me one step from victory...`
`In chess against witches, it is possible to battle onward solely using pieces called X which don't need explanation.`
`Thanks to the "Devil's Proof", I can create as many strange fictions as I want, and use them to fight in the argument.`
`...But that's only within the context of chess with a witch.`
`{n}......In our human world, such an abstract story can't explain anything.`
`The first twilight today was a chain of six locked rooms.`
`{n}...It certainly may be possible for a human.`
`Beato hadn't been able to completely deny everything.`
`However, I don't have a clue who committed the crime,`
` why, and how they actually did it...`
`I shouldn't say this having won,`
` ......but I get the feeling that I would have felt less muddled...`
`if I had just been told right out by {f:5:Beatrice} that it was completely impossible for a human.`
`Although I hide behind these abstract pieces called X,`
`{n}............I couldn't deny that some kind of unthinkable,`
` creepy intention had definitely pervaded this mansion...`
