`There was no way to notice the coming of morning without opening a window and looking at the cloudy sky, which had become a tiny bit lighter.`
`It wasn't a refreshing morning.`
` All that could be heard was the sound of the rain, which had kept falling since last night, and the howl of the wind...`
`"......It's hard to imagine that it's morning.`
` This horrible weather reflects our hearts."`
`"Then I'd say it's pretty gentle, considering.`
` We should count ourselves lucky it's rain that's falling and not spears."`
`"Wahaha.`
` Whether it's rain or spears, bring it on, I say."`
`".........Is it already six o'clock?`
` Fuaaaaaa...`
` Isn't this enough?`
` Can't do much else until the mystery 19th person, {f:5:Beatrice}, takes action."`
`"That is correct.`
` ......However, I believe we have thought of almost every trick they could use against us."`
`"Yes.`
` As long as a traitor doesn't appear among us siblings, we should be able to deal with most situations."`
`"......Haven't we talked about this enough?`
` We ended up staying up all night.`
` ...I'm tired."`
`"You're right.`
` How about taking a little rest after eating breakfast?"`
`"...A good plan.`
` Staying up all night is trying at my age."`
`As they all stretched, they enjoyed this unrefreshing morning as best they could.`
`"Let's go wash our faces or something.`
` I probably look horrible."`
`"..................?`
` What is that horrible stench?"`
`As soon as they exited into the corridor, Kyrie made an openly disgusted expression.`
`"...What's the matter?"`
`"Hey, don't you smell something awful...?"`
`".........Hm.`
` ...What is this stench?`
` It's unbearable..."`
`Because of that fuss, everyone stuck their heads out into the corridor.`
`{n}...It was a faint stench, but after the complaints, they clearly noticed it.`
`Each of them went into the corridor, relying on their own sense of smell to tell them where this strange odor was coming from...`
`"What in the world could it be?`
` Let us have Genji deal with it.`
` I believe he should already have arrived in the servant room to begin the morning preparations."`
`"Mmhm, please.`
` It is difficult to imagine that Gohda, of all people,`
` could be making a breakfast that would cause this kind of stench..."`
`Rudolf's group searched for the source of the smell, and determined that it was coming from underground,`
` from the boiler room.`
`But the door was locked, and they couldn't check inside.`
`Meanwhile, Natsuhi's group were on their way to search for someone in the servant room, when they noticed something strange about the parlor.`
`"......What is this...?!"`
`"Wh‐what a horrible prank...`
` Who would do something like..."`
`Drawn on the door to the parlor, in a paint that reminded one of blood, there was a strange...`
`magic‐circle‐like thing.`
`"No one has come to the kitchen yet.`
` ......Wh‐what is...that?"`
`Eva's group, who had thought the smell had been coming from the kitchen,`
` had returned, having observed that no one was there and that preparations for breakfast had not yet begun.`
`......And they noticed the unusual state of the parlor.`
`"It's no good, the boiler room is locked.`
` Wouldn't it be bad if something's broken down in the boiler room?`
` Was there a servant anywhere around?"`
`".........!`
` Is that vulgar graffiti here too?`
` There was also one on the door to the boiler room."`
`"What's that?!`
` This creepy graffiti isn't just here, it's in other places as well?!`
` Haha, you don't think that this is the witch of the forest {f:5:Beatrice}'s declaration of war, right?"`
`Hideyoshi tried to make fun of it, but staring at this creepy magic circle while listening to the wind and rain really made it seem like it was a message from a witch.`
`...The dripping bright‐red paint made one think of blood, and it made things even more eerie.`
`Hideyoshi tried to open the door, but it was locked.`
`...As a general rule, the parlor was never locked.`
`{n}Someone had gone out of their way to lock it.`
`"......What does this mean...?`
` Did someone secretly leave this graffiti while we were talking in the dining hall?`
` On the doors to the parlor and the boiler room?"`
`"...I'm sure the servants are behind this.`
` We were together the whole time.`
` We all have alibis.`
` ......They probably did this prank on some strange orders from Father."`
`".........Considering the incident yesterday with Maria‐chan's letter,`
` it's more than possible to suspect that the servants are acting on Dad's orders and planning something.`
` ......Where the hell is everyone, anyway?`
` They can't be playing hide and seek.`
` Let's look for them."`
`"B‐...before that, I'm worried about the children.`
` They're alright, aren't they?`
` I'll go and check, and while I'm there, I'll see if there aren't any servants there."`
`"Then let's split up.`
` While you go to the guesthouse to see how the brats are doing, we'll check around inside the mansion.`
` .........I don't want to think about it,`
` but maybe these creepy magic circles aren't just where we've found them."`
`"......We might have become involved in a bizarre game of Father's.`
` ...I will go to him and ask about the situation.`
` ......Though I doubt he'll be good‐natured enough to listen to me."`
`The adults split up.`
`As a result, they confirmed that the four children were safe in the so‐called cousins' room, on the second floor of the guesthouse.`
`It appeared that they had stayed up late last night playing.`
`{n}All of them were snoring loudly, so Rosa decided not to wake them.`
`Furthermore, Nanjo, who had returned early the previous night to rest, was also alright.`
`{n}It seemed he believed in the phrase "early to bed, early to rise", and had awoken refreshed.`
`During that time, Kyrie and Hideyoshi searched for the servants.`
`{n}But they didn't find them.`
`...The servant room in the guesthouse was also empty.`
`"......The children are alright.`
` All of them stayed up too late last night."`
`"The servant room is empty.`
` ...I looked at the shift chart, and the mornin' shift was supposed to begin at six.`
` They should have started workin' by now..."`
`"The nap room was also empty.`
` There were signs that the futons had been used, but they weren't warm."`
`"Y'know what, I think Krauss nii‐san and the others might've hit on it, don't you?`
` ......This is probably a game planned on Father's orders.`
` I'd bet my bottom dollar, he left those creepy scribbles and hid himself somewhere,`
` tryin' to make us do somethin'."`
`"......Are you saying that he's trying to see who is fit to inherit his wealth and the family headship?`
` ...Isn't that a bit..."`
`"No...`
` ...It might not be strange if Father was behind something like that."`
`"After all, Father loves big tricks.`
` ......He might have had this plan brewing ever since that epitaph was hung in the hall."`
`"...In that case, I wonder whether he will make an announcement of the game or an explanation of it.`
` ......It also seems possible that another envelope with the crest might appear, like the one handed to Maria‐chan."`
`"............You're right.`
` Maybe Nii‐san and the rest have found that in the mansion."`
`"Doctor Nanjo.`
` Have you heard anythin'?"`
`"......M‐my apologies, I do not have any idea what is going on.`
` And yet, ......yes, I see,`
` I could easily imagine that Kinzo‐san is planning something big."`
`"...Why don't we go back to the mansion for now?`
` Maybe they found somethin' over there."`
`"If I will not be in the way, I will come too."`
`"I, I'll stay here.`
` ...The children are sleeping upstairs.`
` We don't know what's happening.`
` We can't leave them alone."`
`"......Yes, you're right.`
` I'll stay with Rosa‐san and watch over the place.`
` Would you tell that to my husband?"`
`Rosa and Kyrie remained in the guesthouse.`
`{n}Hideyoshi went with Nanjo, and returned again to the mansion.`
`Meanwhile, in the mansion...`
`Unbelievably, ...or maybe we should say that bad feelings have a tendency to be right...`
`Rudolf's prediction was right on.`
`...Because the same magic circle graffiti that had been drawn on the doors to the boiler room and the parlor had been found in multiple other places throughout the mansion.`
`"Aniki...!`
` How's Dad?"`
`"No, no good.`
` There was no response at all.`
` I did try putting my ear against the door, but I couldn't sense anyone."`
`"...I cannot find the servants anywhere.`
` ...Where in the world did they disappear off to..."`
`"This isn't funny.`
` Father and the servants are hiding, and there are strange magic circles all over the mansion.`
` ......What in the world is happening...?!"`
`There weren't only magic circles on the door to the boiler room and the door to the parlor.`
`{n}There were also two on the second floor,`
` and one on the third floor, for a total of five.`
`They were all the same magic circle, and all of the doors were locked, so they couldn't check inside.`
`"...Anyway, let's do something about the boiler room first.`
` It would be bad if some kind of breakdown caused a fire or an explosion.`
` ...So we need the key."`
`"I believe there was a key box in the servant room."`
`They fished through the key box in the servant room.`
`Because each servant individually carried their own master key around, those weren't kept here.`
`However, all of the individual room keys should have been here.`
`"............It's so packed with keys."`
`"...It isn't here.`
` I've looked and looked, but I can't find the key to the boiler room."`
`"Look, Aneki.`
` ......Only the keys to the rooms with those magic circles drawn on them...`
`are just neatly missing."`
`"......It's true.`
` ...How troublesome......"`
`"It's as though someone doesn't want us to go in the rooms with the magic circles.`
` ......No, they went to all the trouble of making them obvious using the magic circles, so perhaps they do want us to enter...?"`
`"I think it's the latter.`
` ...Breaking down the door is probably impossible, I mean, this isn't a movie.`
` Smashing a window might work."`
`Krauss had a little trouble deciding whether this was a situation that called for smashing a window.`
`At that time, Hideyoshi and Nanjo returned.`
`{n}There was nothing strange in the guesthouse, and the children were safe.`
`{n}They told the others that Rosa and Kyrie had stayed to watch over the place.`
`"Good morning.`
` ...I hear that something strange has happened."`
`"Good morning, Doctor Nanjo.`
` ...I apologize for waking you so early in the morning."`
`"What is it?`
` Didn't you find a letter or somethin'?`
` I was sure you would have found somethin' like that by now..."`
`"......You're right.`
` I also believe that this is a massive joke or game of Father's...`
` But if that was the case, there should be some letter telling us about that.`
` Like the letter that was given to Maria‐chan."`
`"What if the announcement of the game actually was Maria‐chan's letter?`
` The details of the game—‘try to solve the riddle of the epitaph’—have already been shown."`
`"Then, what could the five magic circles we found in the mansion mean?`
` ...And the missing servants."`
`"......Natsuhi nee‐san.`
` How many servants were there total today...?"`
`"Huh?`
` .........Genji, Gohda,`
` ......five of them, why?"`
`"......Five servants.`
` And five magic circles.`
` ......It may be a coincidence, but it worries me."`
`"...Nii‐san.`
` Let's break a window.`
` We should check and see what's inside."`
`"............We have no choice.`
` Do it neatly."`
`Krauss made his decision, and gave permission to smash a window.`
`And they decided that the first room they would break into would be the parlor on the first floor, where the windows would be easiest to reach.`
`They had hoped to peek in through the window,`
` but the curtains were drawn, so they couldn't see inside.`
`Rudolf wandered around the garden, trying to find something that would be good for smashing the glass.`
`Eventually, he found a rock bigger than a fist, and came back.`
`"You don't have to smash the whole thing.`
` Just open it enough so that you can reach the lock."`
`"Don't get your hopes up, alright?"`
`Rudolf raised the rock, and hit the glass with it several times.`
`Before long, he succeeded in skillfully opening a hole big enough that he could unlock it from the outside.`
`...Covering his hand with a handkerchief, he stuck his hand through that hole, and cautiously unlocked it.`
`"We should probably cover it with duct tape later.`
` The rain'll get blown in."`
`When he threw the window open, the wind and rain made the curtains dance around violently.`
` He swiped the curtain to the side.`
`...They could see the parlor they knew well.`
`They were a little relieved.`
` ......Because they had thought that maybe, the room would be filled with more bizarre magic circles,`
` or possibly the traces of some creepy ritual.`
`In any event, they didn't want to hang around out in the rain,`
` so the six of them—Krauss, Natsuhi, Eva, Hideyoshi, Rudolf, and Nanjo—entered the parlor as a group.`
`"......It seems...that nothing in particular is out of the ordinary..."`
`".........mmh—"`
`"Wh‐what has happened, Shannon...?!"`
`"Wait, wait, are you alright?!`
` What happened to you?!"`
`"Blood, blood!!`
` D‐D‐Doctor Nanjo, take a look at this!!"`
`"Hey, Shannon‐chan!`
` Are you okay?!`
` Answer me!"`
`"Y‐you mustn't shake her...`
` I will examine her condition now..."`
`She had been in the shadow of a sofa, so they hadn't noticed her until they entered the room.`
`Shannon was lying on the floor, her chest stained bright‐red with blood......`
`"He~~y,`
` Battleeer, where are yoooou?`
` Look, look, Shannon's corpse has turned up, see~~~?`
` I won't bully you anymore, so come out."`
`"......Hmmmm?`
` Oh, there you are.`
` What are you doing, holding your head in a place like that?"`
`".............................."`
`Battler had his head pressed to the table, and was clutching it with his hands...`
` His pitiful figure made it plainly clear that he didn't want to see anything, didn't want to hear anything...`
`Had he heard {f:5:Beatrice}'s sneering voice?`
`...Could he not hear, or was he pretending that he couldn't hear?`
` In any event, it was clear that he had closed up his heart like a shell...`
`"Pu ku ku ku...`
` ......I wonder if you have tormented him too much, Milady.`
` After showing him that much and demanding a counterargument,`
` I can understand why he wants to mope around."`
`"Hey, Battleerr.`
` If you can't argue back, resign, would you?`
` It's your turn.`
` If you don't make some move or pass,`
` or else give up, we won't get anywhere."`
`"..............................et."`
`"......Huh?`
` What's that?`
` I can't hear you?"`
`"I said BE QUIET!!`
` Aaaah, shut up shut uuuuuuuuuup!!`
` Witches? Magic?!`
` Can't you just do what you want, I don't believe, I don't believe any of it,`
` damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it!!"`
`"Don't talk to me, don't show me anything, go away, go away, go the hell away!!`
` Get your goddamned annoying face AWAY FROM MEEE{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}EEEEEE!!!"`
`"........................!!!"`
`{f:5:Beatrice} instinctively winced at Battler's sudden rage.`
`"......E‐even if you say that, um...`
` If you don't finish your turn, then my turn won't come.`
` I feel like saying, don't make me too bored—"`
`"You think I give a crap, be quiet, SHUT UP!!`
` I don't give a damn about your game,`
` I can't take this bullshiiiiit!!`
` If your turn won't come until mine is finished, then you can just wait for all stinking eternity, can't you!!"`
`"Aaaah, I don't care I don't care I don't get it!!`
` I won't accept witches or magic, I won't accept something that fucked up!!`
` Uuooooooooooohhh, I said DON'T TALK TO MEEEE{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}EEEEE!!!"`
`......I don't know what's what anymore.`
`{n}After being shown something that screwed up, how could I continue to resist...`
`I wandered aimlessly through the rose garden.`
`......It was raining and windy, but that didn't mean my body got wet.`
` ...There was just a feeling of isolation as I wandered amidst the wind and rain without an umbrella.`
`"..................Maybe I...`
`lost to her game a long time ago."`
`...Actually, I wonder whether we hadn't reached a clear resolution in the previous game.`
`After all, I had submitted to her for a time.`
`{n}So the world had been tinted with witches and magic.`
`......Right now, Rokkenjima is a different world, where witches stride around openly and fire off strange magic.`
`...It isn't a matter of accepting it or denying it.`
`Maybe I had mistakenly assumed that I was playing a game on an even footing with Beato.`
`I had already been defeated in the last game, ...and this may just be the signing ceremony of my surrender.`
`Just now, a mighty battle had unfolded in this rose garden.`
`{n}I had seen it with my own eyes.`
`I kicked the ground.`
` ......Obviously, the ground was hard.`
`{n}And a puddle splashed.`
`Several towers had split this ground, sprouting like high‐rise buildings.`
`......The more I kicked this ground,`
` .........the more it felt like that really couldn't be possible.`
`But, because of that, I couldn't explain it with anything other than magic anymore......`
`"......I get the locked rooms with the key shut up inside,`
` they're probably just an extension of what you always see in detective novels.`
` ......But, ......that stuff, though...`
` All that big flashy stuff......`
` Damn iiiiit........."`
`"...............It seems that my disciple has caused you much trouble."`
`"...Huh?`
` .........It's you..."`
`I was suddenly spoken to, so I turned around,`
` ...and in the rose garden arbor,`
` ......was the Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice}, who {f:5:Beatrice} had supposedly defeated a short while ago.`
`".........I was sure you'd died.`
` So, you were alive."`
`"No, I died.`
` ...Now, I am nothing more than a captured chess piece loitering outside the chessboard."`
`"You're Beato's master, right?`
` So, in other words, you're a witch too."`
`"......Yes, that is correct."`
`"Tch.`
` So, in other words,`
` ......that means witches really do exist?`
` And I'm not the one who can defeat her.`
` That'd be you, since you can use awesome magic, wouldn't it?`
` ...I'm just useless now.`
` There's nothing I can do anymore..."`
`"............Oh, my.`
` Have you submitted completely?"`
`"What do you mean, submit?!`
` How the crap should I explain that?!`
` Towers sprouting and falling!!`
` Huge giants holding shields and throwing spears!"`
`"Aaah, just remembering it makes me feel like I'm going insane, reasoning isn't worth a damn anymore, is it?!!`
` We've left the level of tricks and explanations with human culprits!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaahh, shit shit shit shit!!"`
`"Calm yourself.`
` ......I am nothing more than a piece on that child's game board.`
` After being removed from that board, I am no longer a being who can do anything."`
`"But you are that child's opponent.`
` As long as you do not give up by yourself, you will always have the power to strike back at that child."`
`"Shut up!`
` Weren't you also reciting strange spells and summoning towers and spears?!!"`
`"What do you mean, strike back?!`
` Are you saying you'll teach me magic too, telling me to fight her in one of those massive magic battles?!!"`
`"......If you wish,`
` I could teach you a bit about magic."`
`"Oh, just what I wanted!`
` Please, give me some awesome magic to smash her chest in one blow...!!`
` Hah, don't screw with me!"`
`"I hear that in Japanese magic, there is a ceremony to pray for rain.`
` Do you know of it?"`
`"Rain ceremony?`
` That thing where you throw stuff into the fire and offer a dance?`
` ......That's not magic.`
` The fire causes a thermal, and as a result, rain clouds gather.`
` I'm pretty sure that's an accepted scientific phenomenon."`
`"Oh?`
` ...I had believed that it was a form of eastern magic,`
` but it isn't magic?`
` I had believed that people offered sacred fire to the heavens, as well as a dance of respect,`
` so that your entreaty for rain would reach the hearts of the gods."`
`"Maybe people did that long ago.`
` But most occult things like that have a scientific explanation."`
`"Why do things burn?`
` Isn't that because phlogiston is contained in the material?"`
`"......No, things burn because of an oxidation reaction.`
` Lavoisier abolished the phlogiston theory."`
`"Why does heat transfer through objects?`
` Isn't that because caloric is contained in the material?"`
`"......I'm pretty sure that was abolished by Joule.`
` Heat is energy, not a substance."`
`"You have studied well.`
` Your knowledge is correct."`
`"...It's just some random facts."`
`"Phlogiston, caloric, and eventually ether and God's love.`
` ......All are powerless before a scientific explanation.`
` In the past, I was told that an apple falls from a tree...`
`thanks to God's love, so that humans would be given food."`
`"Even gravity was explained by God's love?`
` ...Well, that's probably a leftover from a period when religion rather than science was used to explain everything."`
`"That is correct.`
` In the past, humans called the limits of their knowledge...`
`...no, ignorance itself, "magic".`
` ...Just like the rain ceremony we were just talking about."`
`"Did the people of ancient times...`
`understand the science of fire giving rise to heat to cause a thermal which calls forth clouds?`
` Even without understanding, they at least knew of the result."`
`"......That probably happened a lot.`
` The wisdom of ancestors.`
` Even without understanding the reason, through long experience, they knew that they would obtain that result.`
` ...Phenomena whose principles they didn't understand were probably the same as magic to them."`
`Just like this person had just said, ancient people who didn't understand the principles had probably believed that,`
` through the rain ceremony, their wish had reached the heavens and made the rain fall.`
`To them, that was certainly magic.`
`{n}As long as they didn't understand thermals...`
`"If you press a light switch, the light turns on.`
` ......Children do not know the scientific principles behind why the lightbulb lights up;`
` they press the switch knowing only the result.`
` If they can obtain a result without knowing the principles, isn't that "magic" to them?"`
`"...............That's pretty interesting.`
` ...Well, logically, that's true.`
` ...For example, I don't have a clue why the Braun tubes in a TV show a picture."`
`"However, I think it's completely normal for things to be displayed on the TV.`
` Even if I don't understand the principles behind Braun tubes, I at least know that "if I push the switch I can watch TV"."`
`"...It's exactly the same as having a rain ceremony without understanding thermals.`
` ......In other words, if I don't know the principles, even TV is the same as "magic",`
` no, could you say it is magic?"`
`"Do you know how Braun tubes are constructed?`
` Have you ever taken one apart and looked inside?"`
`"......Nope.`
` I think I read about it in a book or something once, but it was complicated and I didn't have a clue.`
` I think that when electrons hit a fluorescent material, it creates luminescence or something like that..."`
`"That book was a fake.`
` Actually, there are small people called gremlins shut up inside the Braun tubes,`
` and they do their job with magic."`
`"Huh?!`
` That's stupid, there's no way...!"`
`"How can you deny it if you have never looked inside a Braun tube?"`
`"......I've never looked inside, but I can state with confidence that small people like that definitely don't exist!"`
`"Since there is no Braun tube here, that is impossible to prove."`
`"Y‐yeah, it is impossible to prove right this very moment,`
` ...but later I can take apart a TV somewhere and show you, and instantly win the argument!"`
`"So, in other words,`
` my "magic theory", that gremlins are shut up inside the Braun tubes and display the picture with magic,`
` is impossible to disprove until we can verify the contents of a Braun tube, correct?"`
`".........Hmm,`
` .........what the hell, one of those?`
` Are you trying to say it's a "Devil's Proof"?`
` That's your favorite trick, you witches."`
`"The "Devil's Proof" is sophistry exploiting the impossibility of proving a negative fact.`
` However, it is different from what I am talking about with Braun tubes.`
` That could be resolved just by taking apart a single television."`
`"......You're right.`
` It really isn't a "Devil's Proof"."`
`"The scientific theory you propose, and the magical theory I propose.`
` ...One of those is the truth.`
` And which one it is can be ascertained as soon as you look inside the Braun tube.`
` However, until the instant that happens, we cannot deny each other's theories."`
`"So, despite the fact that there is only one truth,`
` until the moment you look into the Braun tube, two conflicting truths can exist at the same time.`
` ......A bizarre space where two truths, of which only one is permitted to exist, may exist simultaneously."`
`Is the cat in the box alive or dead?`
`{n}If you open the box, you will know the answer.`
` You will know the truth.`
`However, until you open the box, you can claim that the cat is alive, and you can also claim it is dead.`
`Each of the two parties makes a claim that according to them is the "correct" truth,`
` and even though the two sides are conflicting, neither can win the argument as long as the box remains unopened.`
`In other words, two truths can exist at the same time.`
`Even though there can only be one cat in the box,`
` it is packed with a living cat and a dead cat, in a strange parallel world.`
`That is what Rokkenjima is now.`
`......This island is now a different world where a science theory and a magic theory exist at the same time.`
`...To a resident of the world of science such as yourself,`
` at a glance, it may feel as though this island has been sucked into a world of magic.`
`While that may be correct, it is not accurate.`
`Strictly speaking, it has moved from the world of science, to the midway point between that world and the world of magic.`
`So at a glance, it appears to you as though the world is tilted towards the magic side.`
`......But actually, this island is now in a perfectly impartial position with relation to the two opposing worlds.`
`"......I don't really get it...`
` Midway between reality and magic?`
` A perfectly impartial world?`
` How's that?`
` Hasn't everything been going really bad for me the whole time...?!"`
`"Then perhaps you could think of it this way.`
` This is a trial.`
` Think of it as a court where you and {f:5:Beatrice} are laying out opposing claims.`
` We could describe it as a Braun tube trial."`
`"That child claims that there are tiny people inside the Braun tubes.`
` And she explains about the lives of the tiny people, what they look like,`
` what type of magical power they have, on and on.`
` ......And you?"`
`"......Well, I study in a library, and argue back by explaining how Braun tubes are constructed, I guess."`
`"At that moment, both your claim and that child's claim exist in the court at the same time.`
` ......If you lend an ear to that child's claim,`
` you may hear it as though it were the truth. See it as though it were the truth.`
` {i:That is precisely what you were shown}."`
`"..........................."`
`"At this moment, on Rokkenjima, witches and magic certainly might exist as truth.`
` ...However, that world is an uncertain wavefunction, existing only until the moment that the cat's box is opened.`
` All states can be justified simultaneously.`
` However, there is one truth."`
`"That is collapsed by observation,`
` and countless truths are weeded out to become one truth.`
` It is like when, in court,`
` the judge makes his judgment.`
` The two truths from the prosecutor's and the defense's claims...`
`collapse by the judgment, and become one."`
`".........So to say it in your words,`
` ......this island right now is the world right before looking into the Braun tube, right...?`
` Therefore, neither the science theory nor the magic theory can be denied.`
` ...And since they cannot be denied—"`
`"Both can exist as truth.`
` That is why both witches and magic can exist.`
` ...However, at the same time, your opinion which denies them can also exist simultaneously as truth."`
`".........It is a world where two conflicting things can exist at the same time.`
` And, it is a world where the conflicting truths cannot disprove each other.`
` .........Is it starting to make sense to you...?"`
`"..................In other words...`
`...no matter how much awesome magic Beato shows me...`
`...that is only a claim from the "magic theory", and it doesn't disprove mine."`
`"So, it's like, "no matter what kind of magic Beato shows me,`
` in this world, that cannot become proof that magic exists"."`
`"That's right.`
` That child will probably even try to explain an apple falling from a tree with magic.`
` That child might shake her staff and pluck the apple with magic,`
` and {i:claim} that she dropped it to the earth."`
`"However, that would be nothing more than another one of her claims.`
` None of her claims can block your opportunity to make a claim.`
` ......In that sense, this world is quite "impartial" to both sides."`
`".........I...get it...`
` ......Still.`
` By that argument, even if I show a sound argument with my "science theory",`
` all it will do is collide head‐on with her "magic theory", and I can't win against her either.`
` Furthermore, there won't be any final judgment unless we peek into the Braun tube."`
`".........Where is the Braun tube in this world?`
` ...It means there's no reason for us to argue.`
` ......Wouldn't it be alright if we just got along and peeked into the Braun tube?"`
`"If there really is a tiny person in there, I suffer total defeat.`
` Otherwise, I win.`
` ......Why do we have to hold this debate without looking into the Braun tube?"`
`"That itself is the "game" which that child has challenged you to.`
` Perhaps, instead of a court, I should use chess as an example.`
` Victory and loss is not determined by a judge.`
` You who are fighting will decide it yourselves."`
`"......Can you win an argument with an opponent in a screwed‐up world where multiple truths can exist at the same time?"`
`"But do you not realize, in point of fact, you {i:were} beaten in an argument, and are sitting here right now submitting...?"`
`"...............Heh.`
` ...Heheheh."`
`"That is all the advice I can give you now.`
` If you wish, I can occasionally give you advice."`
`"......Sure.`
` Thanks, that really helps.`
` ......I'll avenge you."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, thank you.`
` I am looking forward to it."`
`"What's your name?"`
`"...{f:5:Beatrice} used to be my name, but now that I have surrendered it, I do not have a name."`
`".........So, I shall take a temporary name.`
` ......{f:5:Virgilius}.`
` ...No,`
` what about {f:5:Virgilia}?"`
`"{f:5:Virgilia}.`
` Valkyria?`
` Wasn't that the name of a legendary goddess?"`
`"No.`
` It means the one who is a guide to {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......I will guide you to that child who waits at the summit of Mount Purgatory.`
` It should be a fitting name for that kind of guide."`
`"To think that I'd accept help from a witch when I'm trying to deny witches.`
` ......I see.`
` If this is a contradictory world where different claims can exist at the same time, that also works.`
` ...Ihihi, it's almost funny."`
`"I am borrowing that child's words, but you truly are like a phoenix.`
` ......Your will to fight has already been revived."`
`"...Come, if your heart is prepared, return to that child,`
` ......return to the chessboard that child is sitting at.`
` ......I look forward to seeing how far you can fight my disciple."`
`"Yeah, you just watch.`
` ............I won't listen to her babbling anymore.`
` I'll coolly fight to the end.`
` I definitely won't get provoked by her anymore."`
`"Then let us return.`
` To the seat of the battle."`
`"...Oh, ......oooh, Battler...!`
` Where did you hide yourself?`
` *cackle*!`
` I thought the sore loser wouldn't show himself again, you see?"`
`"......Sorry to keep you waiting.`
` I've cooled my head a little."`
`"Aaand?`
` Did you think of a response to that pleasant, thrilling, refreshing, highly acclaimed, wonderful fantasy battle between Master and meeeeeeee?`
` Isn't that impossible to explain without fantasy?`
` Hihhyahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaah?!"`
`"...Milady.`
` You have only just promised to be kind and act refined, remember?"`
`"Ahhyahahahahaha, oops, my mistake.`
` I just get in such a good mood when I see Battler's face, you see?`
` C'mon c'mon c'mon, c'mon then Battler, that battle just now, how will you respond to it?`
` Hmmmmmm?"`
`".................................`
` ...Battle?`
` Did something happen?"`
`"......Whaat?"`
`"Where in this rose garden.`
` Where are all those spears and towers that you grew?`
` Where have they all fallen to?`
` ............They're not here, are they?`
` ......In other words, this is what we see inside the Braun tube."`
`"......Inside the Braun tube, you say??`
` *cackle*, what in the world are you talking about now...?"`
`"In this very moment,`
` there is nothing at all in the rose garden.`
` ...Sure, towers may have been sprouting with magic a short while ago.`
` But that's only until we learn what's inside the Braun tube.`
` ......It is your interpretation that it was a magical battle, and that's nothing more than a claim.`
` And the fact that there's nothing at all here right now is the proof of that."`
`"This is how I argue back about that witch's battle just now:`
` Right now, there isn't anything here, and that proves that nothing happened...!"`
`"..................`
` ......Hahaha, hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!`
` You know, obviously I can't make a huge mess right on the first twilight, and I do like that rose garden, you see?`
` To prevent any damage, I fought inside a barrier.`
` So it's only natural that it wouldn't have any influence on reality."`
`"......That is your "claim"?`
` Well, I guess that works."`
`"However!`
` My claim that, at this point in time, there is nothing in the rose garden,`
` and therefore there was no magic, has not been obstructed in any way!!"`
`"W‐wait, wait, can you deny my magic with that mess?!`
` It is impossible to prove that magic "does not exist"!`
` It's a "Devil's Proof"!!"`
`"The truth is this garden at this very moment!`
` The instant you look inside, the tiny people inside the Braun tube will vanish.`
` And there are no traces of magic here at all!`
` So that battle between you witches {i:did not take place}!!"`
`"Wh‐`
`......what the,`
` th‐that counter......?!`
` That power,`
` ...c‐could it be...?!"`
`"...Have you forgotten, Milady?`
` It is the Multiplanar World Collapsation Technique.`
` The power of a Finite Witch, which is the pair to the power of an Endless Witch.`
` Only an Endless Witch would be able to understand it, and it causes the strongest effect for an Endless Witch."`
`"Sch‐‘Schrödinger's cat box’?!`
` .........Th‐......that old hag of a witch...what an uncalled‐for hint!!"`
`"We've lost time.`
` With the five servants and Grandfather, there are six corpses!`
` Let me check the scene.`
` I've been trudging along wasting time.`
` From now on, I'll speed things up, okay?"`
`"Take a seat, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` It's finally the first twilight, isn't it? Let's start the real thing.`
` Show me what you've got!!!"`
