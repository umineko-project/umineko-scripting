`"...I see...`
` So, not a witch, but a mistress by the name of {f:5:Beatrice} did exist on the island..."`
`"......So there can be more than 18 people!`
` Which means I can defeat that line of reasoning which says that, if it was impossible for all 18 people, it must be a crime involving magic.`
` ......That's some big information."`
`"Excuse me.`
` Battler‐sama, would you care for some black tea and cookies?"`
`Beato's butler, who called himself Ronove, appeared out of nowhere in particular.`
`Placed upon the silver tray that he held was a plate filled with delicious‐looking, steaming black tea and cookies.`
`...I really don't like this guy's smile.`
`{n}For some reason, it doesn't look like a smile used to warmly greet a guest.`
`{n}It feels like he's making fun of me for some reason.`
`...I don't know whether he really takes me for an idiot,`
` or whether it's just a joke or something, but it's really irritating me.`
`"......I don't want any.`
` I'm busy right now.`
` Leave me alone."`
`"Oh, my.`
` That is a shame, when the cookies have turned out oh so very delicious.`
` Cooked so wonderfully it is a shame to waste them on a simple {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, truly wonderful cookies."`
`"I'll eat some when I feel like it.`
` Set it down somewhere over there and get out of here."`
`"Will that be acceptable?`
` Then I shall do so.`
` You may eat them when they get cold and stale, and then regret as much as you like that you did not eat them when they were freshly baked."`
`".........You really are annoying.`
` ...Well, you're a lot better than that Beato, who keeps doing that creepy cackle right next to my ear."`
`"Oh, yes, yes, that is quite true.`
` There are times when Milady's laughter becomes quite undignified.`
` Every time I hear it, I think of my noble rank,`
` and struggle to comprehend why I must have such a person as my master.`
` Pu ku ku ku..."`
`"......Man you're weird.`
` If you don't like it, then couldn't you just not work for her?"`
`"To continue serving despite that is furniture's joy.`
` One could not serve as furniture without such an attitude."`
`"......Let us set that aside.`
` How has the game been proceeding?`
` Just now, I believe I heard you say that you had found some good information, and were quite pleased by it.`
` Well now, I wonder what your shallow wit has thought up."`
`As Ronove made fun of me and giggled,`
` he followed my earlier words to the letter and placed the black tea and cookies somewhere arbitrary nearby.`
`"......I imagine it is because you have gained increased confidence in the existence of a 19th person?`
` Would you be gracious enough to allow me to hear your opinion?"`
`"..................`
` ......Yeah, sure.`
` I'm just going to say it again in front of Beato anyway.`
` No reason to hide it."`
`"......Alright.`
` It looks like there's a hidden mansion somewhere on this island, and that Grandfather had his mistress living there.`
` In that case, the question that's been torturing me, about whether there are 18 or 19 people, can be easily resolved."`
`"Although you deny witches,`
` you hold a double standard by refusing to seek a culprit among the 18, and have driven yourself into a dead‐end."`
`"...The easiest way to deny the witch would be to doubt one of the 18.`
` ......It's not so easy for every one of the 18 to have an alibi.`
` You always find at least one person with a fragile alibi.`
` ......I could probably continue to deny the witch forever if I just used that person as a sacrifice."`
`"However, I will steadfastly refuse to do that!!`
` Yeah, that's no good, that's no goddamn good at all!`
` Every one of those 18 people is either a parent, a relative or a cousin to me!`
` And those reliable servants, who are sometimes serious and sometimes funny.`
` I won't let myself use any one of them as a sacrifice!!"`
`"In the past, my resolve wavered.`
` That's how Beato hit me where my heart was weak."`
`"......Accepting and understanding your own weaknesses.`
` That is not something which can often be accomplished.`
` Battler‐sama, you are using this theory about a 19th person as a spear.`
` ...Or should I say, a shield?"`
`"In any event, unlike how unprepared you were in the games up until now,`
` let us call the fact that you now have a compass bearing on how to fight...a dramatic leap forward.`
` With this, you need not doubt any of the 18 you love and respect,`
` and can easily suspect a 19th person, and pursue your theory that the culprit is a human."`
`"That's it exactly.`
` Like in the first game, when Kanon‐kun was killed in the boiler room,`
` ...and a bunch of other places,`
` there are countless tricks I can use without hesitation if a 19th person existed."`
`In the very first game, Kanon‐kun had been killed in the boiler room.`
`One might think that he was attacked by Kumasawa‐san, who had gone down into the boiler room with him,`
` or maybe that someone who had appeared to be dead earlier was actually faking,`
` and had ambushed Kanon‐kun in the boiler room.`
` Either way, it was a move that forced me to suspect one of the 18.`
`However, by simply proposing that a 19th person exists,`
` there's no longer any need to suspect one of the 18 for that murder in the boiler room.`
`"In short!`
` "Impossible for any of the 18 = The culprit is a witch"...`
` is an equation that I can now deny."`
`Using this argument, we can take, for example, the question which has been raised once again in this game,`
` "who gave Maria the letter?",`
` and come up with an easy explanation.`
` Even if all 18 people have alibis,`
` I can easily explain everything by saying that a 19th person visited her and gave her the letter.`
`".........Hmm, hmm.`
` I think that is quite a good move.`
` How would I strike back?"`
`"......Battler‐sama, despite your understanding, there are still plenty of weak points.`
` Perhaps the "18 people attack" will be an effective move.`
` As an attempt to judge how strong your defense is, it may be interesting to attack from that angle again."`
`"Then how would you do it,`
` demon butler...?!"`
`"......I believe it would be appropriate to attack this 19th piece that you have played.`
` Battler‐sama, have you ever met this 19th person?`
` May I ask you for some proof that this 19th person exists?"`
`"How naive.`
` Of course, I knew you'd probably try that move...!"`
`"My, my.`
` Please respond to it."`
`"Witches and demons and the like...`
` There's no move more appropriate for you than this one.`
` ......And that is—"`
`"The "Devil's Proof"!"`
`When we humans are accused of something, we always counterattack by saying to show some evidence.`
` Because that's a human move.`
`But I'm fighting with a witch.`
`{n}I'm taking part in a battle with someone who isn't human!`
`And some moves exist which can only be used in a game against a witch.`
`{n}There are cheap moves!`
`And that's what this "Devil's Proof" is.`
`{n}Therefore, evidence is unnecessary!`
`Let's take the assumption that there is a hidden mansion on Rokkenjima separate from the Ushiromiya family mansion,`
` and that a woman named {f:5:Beatrice} is living there.`
`In order to prove this, one must find this mansion and actually bring {f:5:Beatrice} out of it.`
`That's called actual proof in the human world.`
`However, if we follow the rules of the "Devil's Proof", you can't disprove that she exists, even if there's no evidence that she does.`
`Because it's impossible to prove that something doesn't exist.`
`......That's right, this "Devil's Proof", which tormented me so much before, I've finally managed to use to my own advantage.`
`Those guys were always trying to force me to accept the existence of the witch by using the "Devil's Proof".`
`That was because, in response to Beato's professions that witches do exist,`
` I physically could not offer any proof that "witches don't exist".`
`That is why I have been subjected to this nonsense that witches exist, and why I have been unable to counterattack.`
`And that's why I'll flip over the chessboard right now!`
`If I can't disprove that witches exist, then that means,`
` if I suggest that a 19th human exists, you can't disprove that either.`
`In other words, the enigmatic mistress in question is craftily hiding herself, so it's perfectly natural that you can never find her no matter how hard you look.`
`So you can't say that "The 19th person can't be found = The 19th person doesn't exist".`
`Therefore, it is impossible to disprove a 19th person.`
`{n}Beato used the "Devil's Proof" to make denying her existence impossible,`
` but this time it's become my weapon.`
`If we can get away with this argument, then never mind a 19th person,`
` this island could be full of people we don't know about,`
` and even if there are ten or a hundred of them hiding, she still can't disprove that they exist.`
`In the last game and the one before that, among the murder scenes that showed up, there were several that were extremely intricate and must have taken a lot of effort to set up.`
`It's very difficult to imagine that a single culprit could have set all of those up.`
`However, if not just a 19th person, but ten or a hundred people were hidden somewhere, that wouldn't be any problem at all.`
`If they all split up the work, they could handle any job in a short period of time.`
`Of course, doubts will naturally arise at whether a large group of people like that could sneak around the mansion without being noticed,`
` but those are all settled by the "Devil's Proof".`
`Because not seeing or not noticing a hundred people inside the mansion does not disprove that they were there.`
`Even though I'm saying it myself, it's such a stupid argument that it makes me wanna throw up!`
` However, it's because it's such a dirty‐as‐hell move that makes it the perfect one to use against a witch.`
`Well, we're only imagining here,`
` ...but the thought of about a hundred suspicious men wearing goat masks hiding in the shadows......`
` That goes beyond "funny", makes me think of cockroaches.`
`If you see one, it means there's a hundred hiding in the shadows.`
`"......Well, I do think this is a ridiculous argument that's horribly twisted.`
` If my opponent was human, I'm sure they'd yell at me like I was out of my mind."`
`"......But my opponent is a witch.`
` And after all, that is the kind of competition we're having, isn't it?`
` I'll use any kind of reckless argument to explain it using humans, and deny the witch!!"`
`"......Anyway, with this move, I'll never again have to doubt any of the 18 who are close to me.`
` I will never again repeat the defeat I suffered last time...!!"`
`"......I see.`
` You have learned from your defeat last time.`
` That is good.`
` It is no surprise that by the third game you have become quite devious."`
`".........You first strengthen your own defense.`
` That is truly a solid first step.`
` Quite a spectacular move, I think."`
`"Well, even if we do assume that there is a 19th person,`
` there are still a few tricks left that I can't get past no matter how many humans I add, like the number of master keys.`
` ...Still, it isn't bad as a first step, for the time being."`
`"This is your trump card, the important piece known as the 19th person.`
` ......You countered my move of asking for evidence by using the "Devil's Proof".`
` ......A good skirmish."`
`"Although I have no excuse for making moves by myself when Milady is absent,`
` .........I find that I too have become slightly interested.`
` ...I wonder if you would permit me to make yet another move on Milady's behalf?"`
`"......Go for it.`
` I don't care if you're a witch or a demon, I'll take you all on!"`
`"The move that you made, the "Devil's Proof".`
` It is a specialty of us demons, but there are also various other moves available to us.`
` ......Do you know of a move called "Hempel's Raven"?"`
`"Hempel's Raven...??`
` What are you talking about?"`
`"...*cackle*cackle*.`
` Ah‐ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah‐ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah‐hah‐ha...!"`
`Just then, ...aah, that laugh, which gets on my nerves every time I hear it, started echoing around.`
`The room was filled with dazzling golden butterflies, and in the center of that whirlwind, the Golden Witch appeared.`
`"Why, if it isn't Milady.`
` Good morning."`
`"I thought you might be doing something interesting while I was away."`
`"......‘Hempel's Raven’, was it?`
` What an amusing and nostalgic move.`
` To think the day would come when it would be introduced to Battler.`
` It's a classic move to use against the "Devil's Proof"."`
`"......Ronove, I will make this move.`
` Do not get in the way of my fun."`
`"So you've finally shown up, you guffawing witch.`
` I see you still have that undignified laugh.`
` ......This guy was talking behind your back just now, telling me about how your laughing lacks class.`
` Right?"`
`"I am offended.`
` Is that true?"`
`"By no means.`
` I have only words of the highest heartfelt respect for Milady;`
` why would I speak such gossip?"`
`"...I can't believe you can say that so brazenly.`
` Doesn't look like we'll be getting along well together..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` Well, that is fine.`
` Let us return to the conversation.`
` "Hempel's Raven" is used to show proof using the contrapositive."`
`"......Essentially, it is a move like this:`
` What must you do to prove that ravens are black?"`
`"Huh?`
` What are you talking about??`
` Prove that ravens are black...`
` ...Wouldn't you just have to catch the ravens and check to see if they're black?"`
`"That is right.`
` You must simply prove that "if it is a raven, it is black".`
` And do you see that, if you prove that "if a bird is not black, it is not a raven", you would reach the same argument?"`
`"If you go throughout the world and examine all birds that are not ravens, and prove that none of them are black,`
` then as a result, you can claim that "therefore, birds that are black are ravens".`
` This is called an argument by the contrapositive.`
` ...Is that difficult for you?"`
`"Yeah, no kidding.`
` ...I have no idea what you're saying."`
`"Battler‐sama.`
` What about this example?`
` Let us say that you have two boxes, and one of them is the winner, with a cookie inside.`
` Of course, the other one is the loser, and is empty."`
`For example, let us say that we have two boxes here,`
` one being the winner with a cookie inside, and the other being the loser, which is empty.`
`Now, it holds that "if there is a cookie inside, it is the winner",`
` and at the same time, it also holds that "if it is not the winner, there is no cookie inside".`
`When such a relationship exists, we call the latter the contrapositive...`
`When "if A then B" is true, then at the same time, "if not B then not A" is also true.`
`"...Well, that's obvious.`
` If the one you picked was the loser, then you would automatically know that the other one was the winner."`
`"...In other words, if you choose the box at random, whether it's the winner or the loser,`
` you'll be able to figure out which box has the cookie in it after your first move."`
`"That is correct.`
` If the cookie is in the box you open, then the "Devil's Proof" is satisfied.`
` You can prove directly that "this box is the winner = this box has a cookie in it"."`
`"However, if the box that you open is empty, then the reverse, "Hempel's Raven", is satisfied.`
` Because then, it holds that "this box does not have a cookie in it = this box is not the winner"."`
`"And that means, as long as we accept the premise that there are no more than two boxes,`
` the contrapositive shows that the other box is automatically the winner."`
`"......Well, I think I'm starting to see your reasoning.`
` Only poison can stop poison, and only twisted logic can stop twisted logic."`
`"...Then what?`
` How does that overturn my claim that "no doubt there is a 19th human hidden on this island,`
` so even if all of the 18 people have alibis,`
` that does not amount to an acceptance of witches"......?"`
`"Very well.`
` I will tell you my move.`
` First of all, you are stating that "if the culprit is not among the 18, then the culprit is a 19th person"."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` ...So if you use the contrapositive, it ends up like this.`
` In short, "if the culprit is not a 19th person, then the culprit is one of the 18"!"`
`"Whaah?!`
` What the, what does that mean?!"`
`"All I have done is turn your move on its head.`
` It shouldn't be that difficult to understand.`
` Ronove, explain.`
` It seems your cookie‐in‐a‐box analogy from before will be easy for Battler to understand."`
`"Then forgive my presumption.`
` Allow me to explain using my earlier example once more."`
`Allow me to repeat once more my earlier story,`
` about two treasure chests, one of which has a cookie in it.`
`In this situation, one of the boxes represents "the 18 people", and the other box represents "the 19th person".`
`So the cookie would represent the "culprit".`
`Battler‐sama, you open the 18 box.`
`{n}Because the cookie is not there,`
` you have proven from the opposite direction that "therefore, the cookie is in the 19 box".`
`In that case, if we reverse things further, we can also say the following.`
`Namely, if it was first shown that the 19 box was empty,`
` it would prove in just the same way that "the cookie is in the 18 box".`
`Battler‐sama, this move you played in order to avoid having to doubt any of the 18,`
` has in fact been used against you to launch the "18 person attack"...!"`
`"......Huh,`
` ......what did you say........."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` If I go first and prove that the inside of the 19 box is empty,`
` automatically,`
` you will be forced to accept that the cookie is in the 18 box.`
` All you have done is say this the other way around, you see?"`
`"So, ......that move that I was so confident in, ...was actually a double‐edged sword?"`
`"That's right.`
` Your move to explain everything with a 19th person carries the risk that, if it is thwarted,`
` you will be forced to accept that you can only explain things by using the 18."`
`I see...`
` "Hempel's Raven".`
`{n}......So this is a countering technique?!`
`...Wait, if I really think about it, this countering technique is far more disadvantageous for me than for her.`
`The problem is in thinking about it like a cookie.`
`{n}If I imagine that just one of the treasure chests is a "losing" chest with a bomb in it, I can begin to understand it quite well.`
`And if I think of it not as two treasure chests,`
` but as 18, one for each person, plus one more for the 19th person,`
` for a total of 19 boxes, it gets even easier to understand.`
`First of all, one of the premises established by the human culprit theory was that the bomb would definitely be in one of those boxes.`
`Because I hadn't wanted to place that bomb in any of the 18's boxes, I had used the "Devil's Proof",`
` and created the 19th box so that I could throw the bomb in there.`
` ......That much was alright.`
`But Beato had struck back like this:`
`If, then, the 19th box was empty inside,`
` that would automatically mean that the bomb was set in one of the other 18 boxes.`
`If I could examine the contents of each of the 18's boxes,`
` and show that the bomb was not in any one of those boxes,`
` I would be able to safely show that the 18 people were innocent.`
`If that was possible, I would be feeling confident!`
`However, in reality, that's as close as you can get to impossible.`
`The police wouldn't come here in this typhoon.`
`{n}There would be no scientific investigations, no autopsies, no nothing.`
`{n}In short, I can't show anything decisively!`
`It's impossible for me to find any proof other than simply gulping down whatever alibis each of the 18 give.`
`In that case, I have to confirm their innocence both personally and perfectly.`
`Like staying with someone the whole time, never letting them out of my sight for a second.`
`If I do that, I can probably be sure of that person's innocence,`
` and that the bomb is not in that box.`
`...However, in reality, something like that is impossible!`
`{n}In other words, I have to expend an incredible effort just to check the contents of one box.`
`And there are 18 of them!`
` In other words, unless I bind all 18 of them in chains and watch over them,`
` it's impossible to prove that all of them have empty boxes.`
`However, Beato only has to open one box, the 19th box,`
` and show that it is empty, to prove that the bomb is in one of the other 18 boxes.`
` (Furthermore, there's no need for her to show {i:which} of the 18 boxes has the bomb!)`
`I have 18 times more work to do to explain my pet theory than Beato does for hers......`
`"Just as you know from the "Devil's Proof",`
` there are many cases in this world where refuting something would take a vast amount of effort that is impossible in practice."`
`"However, "Hempel's Raven" turns that problem around, and makes it possible to prove things easily!"`
`"By using "Hempel's Raven", various reckless arguments become possible to prove."`
`"......For example, let us say that I make the proposition "All humans except me are foolish".`
` Normally, in order to prove this, I would have to examine all of humanity except myself and show that they are all foolish."`
`"...However, in reality, it would be impossible to investigate billions of people.`
` It is exactly the same kind of effort you would need to open all 18 boxes."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` However, by using "Hempel's Raven", the contrapositive of that proposition would change it as follows."`
`"Essentially, take this "All humans except me are foolish", and to use your style of phrase,`
` flip over the chessboard, and you merely need prove that "not foolish = me".`
` ......And what do you think that means?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` As soon as I know the fact that "I am wise",`
` I finish proving in an instant that every one of the billions of people in the human race is foolish.`
` In less than a second, I can finish proving that the entire human race is more foolish than me!!"`
`"It's the strongest and fastest QED in the world.`
` This...`
`is "Hempel's Raven"!"`
`"Wha‐.........what a ridiculous argument.........!!!"`
`"It is a very, very convenient move.`
` Not only demons, but gods also use it.`
` When you propose "blessed = God's servant",`
` the contrapositive is "if a human is not a servant of God, then he must not be blessed"."`
`"So in order for servants of God to prove that they are granted fortune by their divine protection,`
` they only have to prove that those who don't receive that divine protection suffer misfortune."`
`".........Therefore,`
` by bringing misfortune down upon those people who don't believe in their own god, they prove their own blessedness."`
`"It takes an enormous cost to give humans happiness.`
` ...However, the necessary cost to bring humans misfortune is much cheaper."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` So by using "Hempel's Raven", gods can actually give believers the joy of divine protection at the lowest cost."`
`"Y‐......you demon.`
` It's a demon's argument...`
` ...That's messed up...!!!"`
`"It seems that we've gone off‐topic.`
` Let us return to it."`
`"I have finished describing the move for my counterattack.`
` ......The counterattack to your claim that "a 19th person is the culprit; therefore, the 18 are innocent and the witch doesn't exist" is:`
` "In that case, if I can prove that the culprit is not some 19th person,`
` do we agree that the culprit must either be one of the 18, or a witch?".`
` I await your answer."`
`For a while, I just stood there, shocked, completely forgetting to close my mouth...`
`Just when I'd thought that I'd got my own back on them by using their favorite move against them,`
` the counterattack to that had been this reckless argument that I could not even have begun to imagine...!`
`Was it really...impossible...?!`
`To continue denying the witch on an island with no more than 18 people,`
` and yet still believe in the innocence of those 18 people...`
` .........Was that just a delusion?!`
` Was I just trying to escape reality?!`
`Not yet...`
` ......Don't give up this struggle yet.`
`Who cares about "Whoever's Raven"?`
`{n}They're just trying to speak in riddles by bringing up some weird bits of trivia...`
`I had used the "Devil's Proof".`
`{n}Don't feel doubt in something once you've used it.`
`{n}Believe in the spear you've lunged forward with.`
`Apply even more force......and gouge it in......!`
`"......The game is still in the opening.`
` Do you already intend to spend this long thinking?"`
`"........................`
` Ah,`
` ......wait a sec,`
` I want to be sure."`
`"While yes, I did use the phrasing of a "19th person" to make it easy to understand,`
` if I can use the "Devil's Proof" to raise the number of people above 18,`
` then what I mean is an unspecified large number of extra people—you don't know if it's ten or a hundred."`
`"{i:Always one more than you assume}.`
` ...Understand?"`
`She had returned my twisted logic with something even more twisted.`
`{n}So the only thing that could counter that would be even crazier twisted logic...!`
`"Hmm, I see.`
` .........Even if I somehow prove an alibi for the 19th person,`
` as soon as I do, you will think up a 20th person, and claim that they are the culprit.`
` By repeating this infinitely, you would make it so I kept searching for their alibis for all eternity."`
`"......I see, I see, *cackle*cackle*!`
` Just like a demon king summoning a plague of locusts.`
` I wouldn't expect anything less from Kinzo's grandchild.`
` It looks like you have been gifted with a talent in summoning."`
`"......In short!`
` It is impossible to continually prove an alibi for the "X" existing outside of the first 18!`
` ......How do you like that, Beato...?!`
` Now that I know we're having a battle with twisted logic, I won't lose!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` How foolish...`
` Who do you think I am?`
` I am the Endless Witch, the Infinite Witch!`
` For you to challenge me at infinity is absurd.`
` Having control over infinity means also that I am able to kill infinity."`
`"......When your 19th person folds, you will call a 20th,`
` and when your 20th person folds, you will call a 21st,`
` and when your 21st person folds and your 22nd person folds,`
` you will call a 23rd, a 34th, a 64358223579673204th,`
` you think you can trifle with me for all eternity?!"`
`"I laugh at "infinite regress",`
` the {i:infinite} doesn't affect me!!"`
`"Hoh, well then, how will you kill my "infinity"? Just try and show me!!"`
`"`
`{p:1:I have the power to speak the truth in red}!!!"`
`".....................!!`
` .........Here it comes............"`
`"When I speak in red, it contains absolutely no illusions.`
` If I say once in red that there are no more than 100 people on this island,`
` you will no longer be permitted to create a 101st person."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Come now, Battlerrr.`
` What truth shall I tell in red this time?`
` Where shall I strike for the kill and force you into hopelessness?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Come, show me your usual frightened face......"`
`".............................."`
`"..................What?"`
`"......Ihihihihi."`
`"...Why...are you laughing...?"`
`I wonder what kind of creepy look I had on my face as I laughed right then.`
`{n}That red sure is scary.`
` ...Every time it jumps out, I'm driven into the depths of hopelessness.`
`But......I had already realized it.`
`{n}...There was no need to be unnecessarily afraid of the red.`
`".........You've brought out your secret weapon again.`
` So...?`
` What and how will the great {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama speak in red this time?"`
`"......Hoh.`
` What do you mean by this?`
` Suddenly looking so relaxed..."`
`"Sorry, but I've been waiting for you to take out that blood‐red treasured sword.`
` ......Let's see, what will you proclaim in red this time?"`
`"You aren't going to say "the culprit was one of the 18", are you?`
` Let me warn you, that would be self‐destruction, remember?`
` That would be the same as throwing away your own witch theory yourself.`
` A complete resignation."`
`That's right.`
` The red isn't always necessarily to Beato's advantage.`
` On the contrary, if she used it the wrong way, it's dangerous enough that she could bring about her own death.`
` If she used it carelessly and said something which ended up denying herself, that would be exactly the same thing as self‐destructing.`
`"Of course,`
` it would also be sad and difficult for me to accept if you told me in red that one of the 18 was the culprit.`
` ......No matter who the culprit actually was, it would surely bring me some tough emotions..."`
`"But before that, it would mean your defeat!`
` Saying in red that the culprit is a human is equivalent to your proclamation of resignation!!`
` If you want to strike me a blow so badly you're prepared to die at the same time, I think that's a pretty interesting move.`
` However, this battle will end in my victory!!"`
`{f:5:Beatrice}'s red was truly her secret weapon, her treasured blade.`
` The things she spoke in red would become solidified as the truth, and no amount of evidence or counterarguments could change them.`
`They had cut me down to size many times now, rending in two any supports my heart had to lean on.`
`However, if she used it carelessly, then I could also find a little information about the truth.`
`...In the last game, especially during the chapel's locked room trick, I had taken advantage of that,`
` and had once closed her in almost completely.`
`But she was also pretty sly.`
` She had learned from experience, and since then, had started using discretion in the timing of the red...`
`This feeling of tension was almost literally like a battle with real swords.`
`...This was a battle of high intelligence.`
`{n}......No, not of intelligence.`
`{n}It really was twisted logic.`
`This was the world's craziest and worst battle of twisted logic...!!`
`"So, now it's your move.`
` ......That's right.`
` To use your "Hempel's Raven",`
` first, you'll have to confirm in red how many humans there are other than the 18."`
`"And after that, if you proclaim in red that none of the people in that group are the culprit,`
` ......that's right, that might be a fatal wound to me."`
`".........I'm surprised that you no longer have even an atom of fear for that red which you feared so much...`
` You're quite sturdy."`
`"Unsheathe it.`
` Your treasured blade.`
` ......A single perfect swing, and you might be able to break me this time, who knows...?"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` ...Interesting.`
` I wouldn't have it any other way..."`
`Agitate her.`
` Provoke her.`
`{n}Drive her into a corner to make her speak in red...`
`Of course her red has always cut right through my only threads of hope.`
` But......don't be afraid of that.`
`On this island overcome with falsehoods and illusions, the only thing I can trust...`
`is the information that she speaks in red.`
`It is my only way across the chasm of Hell.`
` Just a single tightrope.`
`Her merciless blood‐red blade is the only way I can survive.`
`...This isn't just walking on a tightrope, it's literally like walking on the edge of a blade...`
`Of course I'm afraid.`
` In terms of her contrapositive, my victory condition—the denial of the witch—meant that the culprit was a human.`
`But I didn't want to search for the culprit amid the 18.`
`...Therefore, I held on to a weak point, since I had to deny the witch and the 18 at the same time.`
` Since I had been unable to understand that last time, that was where she had hit me, leaving me tattered and defeated.`
`......But that's alright.`
`{n}Let her hit me.`
` Let her attack.`
` No problem...`
`Someone said it once in an old sword‐fighting movie.`
`{n}That "a good fortress has one, and only one, intentionally weak point".`
`The enemy would gather there.`
` They would be lured there.`
`{n}And that would be where the actual battle took place.`
`...As long as I understand my weak points,`
` and as long as she wants to attack those weak points,`
` ......it's as if I've induced her to attack there...`
`Carefully judge the distance from your enemy, ...and retreat step by step.`
` Make them draw their sword first.`
`The more she recklessly flourishes that red, the more chances I'll have to strike back.`
`Don't be afraid of the red.`
`{n}Keep the pressure on, so that she is forced to refute with the red......!`
`No matter how oppressively she speaks in red,`
` ......yes, that red itself is the same as fresh blood spurting from her wounds.`
`"Come on.`
` ...What's wrong?`
` ......First of all, why don't you tell me in red how many people are on this island total?`
` If you don't, your raven can't cut me up......!"`
`".....................Hmph.`
` ...How surprising that you can be this desperate and yet this difficult.`
` ...One cannot make light of someone putting their life on the line, no matter what the era."`
`"......It's no surprise you're Kinzo's grandchild.`
` The more cornered you are,`
` ............the bolder you become!"`
`"...Ihihihi..."`
`Ronove cleared his throat.`
`"You appear to be at a standstill.`
` That black tea I worked so hard to make is getting cold,`
` Milady."`
`".........kh."`
`Ronove, who was supposed to be her ally, roguishly rushed her next move.`
`Beato smiled back, probably intending to demonstrate that she was still relaxed, ......but she couldn't hide the sweat building up on her forehead.`
`By now she had completely lost that relaxedness which had allowed her to turn her nose up at her worthless opponent.`
`Of course, she probably wasn't really cornered by something like this.`
` ...She was just...being cautious.`
`Until now, I had been inexperienced.`
`{n}I didn't have a good grasp on how to fight, and I was underpowered as an opponent.`
`However, now that we had reached the third game, she realized that I was starting to become skilled,`
` and she had grown more cautious, thinking every move over carefully......`
`Sure, that's just fine, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}And sorry to have kept you waiting.`
`{n}Are you happy now...?`
`"......Now things are starting to get interesting, right......?`
` Hihihihi!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` ...Battleeeeerrrrr......"`
`"This isn't going anywhere...`
` Then, should I just dive right in and go with the usual?"`
`"......Hoh.`
` The usual, you say.`
` ...Then by all means.`
` If I don't hear that, I guess I just won't get the sense that we've started..."`
`The first move was mine......`
`"Here I come, Beato."`
`"Repetition requested.`
` ......‘There are only 18 people on this island’."`
`"....................."`
`"...If I hear you say this in red, I will have no choice but to doubt one of the 18.`
` ......Since it could no longer be the work of a 19th person, all doors will be closed to me."`
`".........But I believe that the culprit is definitely not one of the 18!`
` There's no way that any of those 18 could commit such brutal murders...!!"`
`"....................."`
`"I'll say it again.`
` Repetition requested!`
` "There are only 18 people on this island"."`
`"..............................`
` .........I decline.`
` I won't say why."`
`Whew...!`
` I had avoided what would have been the worst red for me.`
`If she had repeated that,`
` I would have been faced with those two worst choices of accepting the witch or suspecting one of the 18,`
` like last time all over again...`
`But Beato had not proclaimed my ultimate and greatest weakness in red.`
`She had declined to repeat it—even though there was no reason why she shouldn't have struck—even though it was a weakness she should have been drooling at.`
`She hadn't sliced me up with red by using that move, which should have been as good as forking a rook and the king...!`
`......This was a big sign of my advantage.`
`That's right.`
` The culprit isn't one of the 18 people.`
`{n}I won't doubt anyone...!`
`And since the culprit isn't a witch either,`
` .........it means that a 19th person exists on this island.`
`And that's you.`
`A person who, as Grandfather's mistress of thirty years,`
` has been living secretly in a hidden mansion in the forest for a long, long time.`
`The {i:human} {f:5:Beatrice}.........!!`
`"That's right.`
` You aren't a witch or anything like it.`
` ......You're just a human...who's been living on this island in hiding for several decades...!"`
`".........*cackle*cackle*.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*...`
` ...Did you just call me, the Endless Witch who has lived for over one thousand years, a mere human?`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`For a while, {f:5:Beatrice} continued to laugh unpleasantly, gloating or maybe spiteful.`
`"...Are you ready? I'll keep going.`
` ...Again, repetition requested."`
`"‘There are at least 19 people on this island’!"`
`".............................."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} fell silent once again.`
`The feeling that confirming the number of humans on this island...`
`might possibly stand to give her some large disadvantage,`
` was probably making her extremely cautious.`
`The red had already become a foothold for my counterattack.`
` With that in mind, the red had become a risk for the witch.`
`But if she couldn't repeat this, her "Hempel's Raven" wouldn't work.`
`In order to break my "Devil's Proof",`
` first, the existence of and number of people outside the 18...`
`needed to be confirmed in red.`
`That's right.`
` She couldn't break the existence of a 19th person unless she used red.`
`I had {i:closed Beato in}, giving her no choice but to speak in red...!`
`There really was...`
`.........a way to fight,`
` ......in this witch's game!`
`"It's alright to decline.`
` ...If you can't say it in red, then that will mean the total number of people on this island will be 18+X."`
`"......That X is a pretty huge piece to allow me to have on the first move, isn't it?`
` After all, from then on, all of the tricks with the basis "it was impossible for any of the 18"...`
`will become explainable with a human X outside of the 18 people.`
` ......This is a huge piece that can break open any locked room hinging on everyone having an alibi...!"`
`It was just like...`
`a bishop in chess, which can cut a thin line through enemy forces as long as there's a slight gap.`
` It only exerts an effect over squares of the same color, but it has a great ability to control the board.`
`"..............................`
` ..................kh."`
`It looked like Beato also well understood her current plight.`
`She couldn't just let such an important piece go, especially this close to the beginning of the game...`
`If she pulled out her red treasured sword, it wouldn't be that difficult to save that piece.`
`......But Beato was completely aware that I was expecting it.`
` She was afraid that a careless red truth might end up strangling her own neck...!`
`Because, ...in the first place, a witch was something which should be {i:denied} in red.`
`Believe.`
` Don't doubt!`
` Witches don't exist!`
`{n}Something like that can't exist in this world.`
`They can only exist in the cracks in reality.`
`...They are a fragile existence, curled up in these cracks, frantically trying to protect themselves from the brutal winds of truth,`
` and they can only barely exist like a mirage by surviving on falsehoods and fantasy.`
`In other words, the red, which only witches can use, is the very reality by which they risk denying themselves.`
`......The more they brandish their red words...`
`the more they begin to lose, bit by bit, that crack in reality inside which they can endure.`
`That is why they don't want, through the red,`
` ......to carelessly lose that crack in reality which is based on fuzzy information, or in other words, fantasy.`
`Because they understand that they would be gradually cornering themselves.`
`Of course, she would never admit it.`
`Because, if she did,`
` it would be the same as admitting that she is something that can't exist in this world, like an imaginary number.`
`Don't be afraid.`
` Stay strong...!`
`{n}She knows this deep down, and better than anyone.`
`That her red treasured sword can't easily be used without considerable resolve...!`
`"...What's wrong.`
` I'll say it again.`
` ......Repetition requested!"`
`"‘There are at least 19 people on this island’!"`
`"........................`
` ......Hmh.`
` ...I decline."`
`At the end of a long, long time spent deliberating,`
` ......letting a single deep breath escape, she quietly proclaimed her refusal.`
`......I had thought that she'd use it.`
`But Beato refused to speak in red, even though it would cost her victory in the opening part of the game.`
`"You declined, yes......?`
` Which means that, from now on,`
` I can create as many fictional character Xs outside of the 18 as I want...?"`
`"Do as you wish.`
` ...I have declined your repetition.`
` Isn't that enough for now?`
` ......The reason I declined was...`
`......`
` ...No, I will not reveal that for now.`
` You will know soon in any case."`
`"...Ihihi.`
` Still acting tough, I see..."`
`"......Red that I deliberately don't use is in itself a fitting use of red.`
` You called it my red treasured sword.`
` A pleasant analogy.`
` I will use it too.`
` ......A treasured sword is at its best when it is sheathed.`
` In fact, there are times it can instill even more fear because it is sheathed."`
`"That's right.`
` ...As I fight, I always have to keep in mind when you might turn everything over with those red words.`
` It's some pretty serious pressure."`
`"......And there are times when having a repetition declined makes things harder for me.`
` ...Those times, I can't tell whether you can't repeat because my guess was right,`
` or whether you're just misleading me and letting me think whatever I want."`
`"...In that sense, yes, I see.`
` A sheathed treasured sword."`
`"............What does it matter?`
` If I'm going to push you off a cliff anyway, I might as well let you climb a little higher first.`
` ...We have still barely begun.`
` Much is left to come..."`
`"I'll resign from this challenge.`
` ...Go and get drunk on your faint victory for now.`
` ......Only for now."`
`That bitter comment did, in fact, appear to have marked the end of the game's opening battle.`
` Even so, I couldn't relax my guard at all.`
`...I was unable to relax my feeling of tension until I was greeted by the sound of Ronove's applause...`
`"......Spectacular, Battler‐sama.`
` I suppose we could say that this game has started with at least the opening unfolding to your advantage?"`
`"No idea...`
` I still don't know whether this piece was something I tore from her with my own hands,`
` or whether she guided me into taking it."`
`"......After all, knowing you...`
`you probably know that I'm being led into a trap, and that clapping is just a barefaced lie, right...?"`
`"How could you think that?`
` I am innocently celebrating your ability that has enabled you to take one shot at Milady, though granted it is only the opening.`
` ...After all, Milady is a person who is quick to become arrogant.`
` I believe that a little stimulation such as that makes for a good medicine every once in a while."`
`"...This butler of yours sure has a vicious tongue..."`
`"Isn't that so?`
` Sometimes he enrages even me."`
`"My, my, how incredibly rude of me."`
`"Well then, Milady, Battler‐sama.`
` Would you care for some more black tea?`
` The game has still barely begun.`
` Please leave any tea or pastries that might adorn this game to me.`
` Please, do not hesitate to advance further in the game."`
`"I will.`
` Let's move forward.`
` Now is when it really starts."`
`"............Hmph.`
` Very well.`
` Let us advance the clock.`
` Ronove, black tea, please."`
`"Certainly.`
` What about a cookie?"`
`"No need.`
` Give it to Beelzebub to keep her happy.`
` ............Remain silent for now."`
`While listening to the sound of the demon butler pouring tea, the witch closed her eyes slightly and fell into silence.`
`......For some time, she was deeply lost in thought, but eventually a roguish glint came into her eyes.`
`"Very well.`
` ............Why don't I inform you now why I declined to speak in red for the first move."`
`"......What...?`
` Bring it on.`
` Show me what you've got."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...`
` It really is a big piece that you'd hate to miss."`
`"......It may be hasty, but allow me to move.`
` I won't use red, but from here on, Rosa will explain on my behalf.`
` Listen."`
`"Of course, I agree as well.`
` You too, right, Rosa?`
` ...............Rosa?"`
`"Huh, ah, sorry...`
` M‐me too.`
` I agree."`
`".........What's wrong, Rosa‐san.`
` ...You've been really quiet for a while now.`
` Are you feelin' sick...?"`
`From the beginning, Rosa had never been one to willingly cut in on the siblings' fights.`
`...But even so, she seemed unmotivated,`
` and had said almost nothing at all during this night's conference.`
`The whole time, she had been hanging her head, and appeared to be thinking of something else...`
`"You've been in a daze for a while now.`
` Do you think you can protect the inheritance like that?`
` You are also the mother of your child, so get a stronger hold on yourself."`
`"I, I'm sorry......"`
`"I imagine you woke up quite early this morning?`
` If you feel sick, you shouldn't overdo it."`
`"......The beds have been prepared in the guest rooms.`
` How about taking a rest?`
` I will guide you."`
`"No, ...I'm fine.`
` Thank you."`
`"...What is it?`
` Is there something you're worrying about?"`
`".........No, not really........."`
`"Are you sure...?`
` It feels like your mind has been elsewhere this whole time.`
` ...I wonder if that has anything to do with what we've been talking about...?"`
`At those words, everyone stared at Rosa together.`
`As if in response, Rosa's shoulders quivered.`
`Apparently Kyrie's guess hadn't been wrong.`
`{n}...Nor did Rosa deny it...`
`"..................No, umm...`
` ................................."`
`She swallowed whatever it was she had been about to say, and went silent again.`
`By now, even the other siblings were also beginning to realize that something about her demeanor was different from usual...`
`"What is it?`
` ...You've been weird for a while.`
` Do you have something on your mind...?"`
`"All of us've just sworn to remain united, haven't we?`
` Don't be all unfriendly now, worryin' by yourself.`
` Let's talk it over."`
`"......Rosa.`
` Tell us."`
`Pressed by the men one after the other, Rosa made up her mind, and nervously began to open up...`
`It was almost...`
`as though she was trying to confess to some modest prank which had inadvertently brought about a serious situation...`
`such was the atmosphere in the room.`
`"No, umm......`
` ......Th‐this mistress of Grandfather's, this {f:5:Beatrice},`
` ......is she really, um,`
` .........still alive, I was wondering..."`
`"Huh?`
` Obviously she's alive.`
` She's sending letters to us, what more do you want?"`
`"Whether she's healthy or not is a different story though.`
` The lovely woman in that portrait must be getting up there in age by now."`
`"I'd think she's healthy.`
` People who are crafty when it comes to money are healthy no matter how old they are!`
` Evil plans might even be the best rejuvenating agent.`
` Wahahaha."`
`"......She can't be...`
`......alive."`
`"Huh?`
` ......What did you just say?"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice} is...`
`...dead...`
` .........I,`
` ...I killed her...!"`
`"Wh‐......what did you say......?!"`
`"...Wh‐...what do you mean, Rosa...?!"`
`"B‐but, it's not like I was the one who kill—`
` ......But, but I was the one that brought her to a place like that!`
` ...I really did kill her...`
` I tried to make myself believe it was a dream!!"`
`"......But......it really wasn't after all!`
` Which means this is......a letter from {f:5:Beatrice}'s ghost!!`
` Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`It was so sudden that everyone was lost for words.`
` Rosa kept on talking, unable to stop, holding her head as her hair flew all about...`
`"Please, calm yourself...!`
` Rosa‐san...!"`
`"I, I have absolutely no clue what's goin' on...!`
` Already dead?`
` What do you mean...?!"`
`"......I think it means two things.`
` First, ...its literal meaning.`
` ...And second, it substantiates that our earlier guess was correct."`
`"Which means......`
` .........Rosa, ......you have met with {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"I, I've never heard Rosa speak about that once.`
` ...Rosa, when was it?`
` When could you possibly have met {f:5:Beatrice}?!"`
`"Long ago!`
` Long, long, long ago!!`
` We had just moved over to the island and I was young!!`
` It wasn't my fault, it's not like {i:I} killed her...!!`
` Uuuuuuuuughhhuuu!!"`
`"...Calm down!`
` Nobody's blaming you for anything, alright?`
` First, drink some water.`
` Okay?`
` Natsuhi‐san, the pitcher, please."`
`"Y‐yes.`
` .........Here you go, Rosa‐san.`
` Please, calm yourself......"`
`".........................................."`
`Until Rosa was able to regain her calm amidst her ragged breathing, ......no one was able to speak a word...`
