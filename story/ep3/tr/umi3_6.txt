`"...........................Now then.`
` How will the game be resolved this time?`
` ...You may submit, and you may resist.`
` ......Either way, it will truly be an entertaining banquet worth betting my short remaining life on."`
`In his dimly lit study, which was occasionally brightened by lightning,`
` Kinzo kept mumbling to himself, laughing to himself.`
`On the antique clock with an intricate design that was sitting on his desk,`
` the two overlapping hands had begun to tilt to the right, and separate from one another.`
`The passage of time that had counted to 24 had returned to 0, and begun to start counting again...`
`"......The passage of time is a brutal thing.`
` It drags itself all the way to 24 over the course of a day, and then returns back to 0.`
` ......It surely managed to count to 23:59.`
` However, was it ever able to reach 24:00?`
` ......If you believe that it returns to 0:00 again without reaching it, how futile it seems."`
`No, is that not the same as a person's life?`
` You live, aiming for a perfect 24, and in the instant you reach it, you return to 0.`
`People may praise the departed, saying that they did reach 24, but that is absolutely not 24.`
`.........It is nothing more than 0.`
`"I am different.`
` ......I will reach 24 alive.`
` Because that itself is the Golden Land.`
` ...That is {f:5:Beatrice}'s dwelling."`
`Kinzo had been fumbling around with some tarot cards for some time.`
`It looked as though he was trying to divine his own luck, his own propensity for victory, and doing it over every time he didn't like the result.`
`The most forbidden action in tarot reading is to try predicting the same thing twice.`
`It is a desecration to the result of the fortune telling,`
` and also desecrates the existence higher than humans which delivers signs through the tarot cards.`
`However, Kinzo knew.`
`The reason the tarot cards shouldn't be used twice was that, since it was nothing more than a random number generator,`
` it was natural that if you read them twice, a different result would appear.`
`......Therefore, reading twice was only forbidden to preserve the mystique of the tarot cards' results.`
`...However, that didn't mean that Kinzo didn't take tarot reading seriously.`
`Kinzo's interpretation of tarot reading was done in a completely different way.`
`That was to repeat the reading, over and over, until he reached the result most favorable to him,`
` without the slightest amount of compromise.`
`It would depend on how he defined the result most favorable to him,`
` but if he demanded the best result in a strict sense,`
` it would be the same as a simple roulette of luck, where he sought an arithmetic miracle.`
`......However, to Kinzo, who made miracles of numbers the basis of his magical power, this could become very much like a magic ritual.`
`In other words,`
` until the result he desired appeared perfectly, he would repeat the tarot readings over and over, turning his labor, conviction, and the feelings of his heart into a prayer,`
` so that when it reached heaven, the result would be sublimated—this was Kinzo's personal magical interpretation.`
`Therefore, even though the tarot cards Kinzo used were exactly the same as generally used tarot cards,`
` the way they were used was completely different...`
`".................................`
` ...Tonight, ......it refuses to go my way."`
`Kinzo stopped his hands for a second.`
`...It seemed the result he expected wasn't showing up.`
`On the contrary, many bad cards that shouldn't often appear were appearing repeatedly,`
` and continuing to interfere with the miracle Kinzo wished for.`
`"..................Hmph.`
` ...Is that how it is?"`
`It seemed that Kinzo had taken some kind of sign from this abnormal course of events.`
`But judging by the unlucky cards scattered over the desk, it was difficult to imagine that the sign had been a good one...`
`For a while, Kinzo closed his eyes tightly, pondering something.`
`Then as the thunder roared, he made up his mind about something, took the telephone receiver, and dialed.`
`"............It is I.`
` Is Genji there? It is urgent."`
`"..................haah."`
`In front of the main entrance, Shannon was cooling her flushed face in the frigid air.`
`...She had thought...`
`...that George's proposal would surely come sometime.`
`It wasn't as if her heart had been unprepared.`
`{n}And she had nodded as an answer.`
`Had she been reckless because of her youth?`
`{n}Should she have thought about her future more seriously?`
`She found herself worrying that he might have thought of her as a cheap girl because of her immediate reply.`
`...Perhaps at least holding off until tomorrow morning would have given the impression of thinking more seriously?`
`Now that she had already received the ring from George,`
` Shannon kept fidgeting in embarrassment, thinking she should have done this, should have done that.`
`As she did, she heard the sound of footsteps coming towards her, splashing through puddles.`
`Shannon immediately chased away the emotions welling up inside her.`
`"......Genji‐sama?`
` Kanon‐kun too...!`
` I, I'm sorry, for not coming back right away, umm..."`
`She grew stiff, thinking that she would surely be scolded for spending too much time in her secret lover's meeting with George.`
`"Shannon.`
` The Master has told us to come to the study urgently.`
` Let us hurry."`
`"......Huh?`
` Y‐yes, certainly...!`
` What in the world...?"`
`"He said he had an ominous premonition.`
` ......How selfish, when he was the one who chose to start this ritual."`
`"We will enter from the back, so that Gohda doesn't notice us.`
` Hide your footsteps."`
`"Yes.`
` .........Nee‐san, take care.`
` You're so noisy."`
`Kanon was especially good at hiding his presence.`
`...Like he was a cat.`
` He was able to suddenly be there without anyone noticing, and leave in the same way.`
`So, even if he were to step in a puddle,`
` the sound he would make would be far smaller than that of the rain hitting the puddles...`
`Genji also had that ability.`
` ...Well, in the first place, that was how the servants were supposed to be, even going by the name of furniture.`
`Just like how desks and closets go unnoticed by members of the family,`
` the servants also treated being able to show up unobtrusively when they needed to as their greatest virtue.`
`In that sense, Shannon's footsteps still strongly asserted themselves.`
`...She was also trying to hide her footsteps,`
` but compared to Kanon and Genji, well, you could say she was a little more lively...`
`Eventually they reached the back door, and the three of them entered the mansion.`
`Immediately, .........they thought they felt something.`
`It wasn't quite a sense of smell, ...rather, they felt it from the depths of their noses,`
` ......and this hard‐to‐describe sensation, which you might call a sixth sense, allowed them to perceive that something was different than usual.`
`"............Genji‐sama."`
`"...Yes. We must hurry."`
`That perception caused them to feel that something tense was closing in on them.`
`Realizing that, the three of them dashed up the stairs, aiming for Kinzo's study, still hiding their footsteps.`
`When they dashed up the stairs, ...that smell of sweet poison particular to Kinzo's study reached their noses.`
`".....................hm."`
`"What is it, Genji‐sama...?"`
`"......The barrier is...dead."`
`"Huh?`
` ...............Ah."`
`After hearing Kanon, she looked at the door to the study.`
`{n}A scorpion pattern was engraved on the doorknob.`
`A powerful magic‐repellent.`
` The final barrier, which protected Kinzo himself.`
`It had been broken.`
`Of course, there was no change to the doorknob that the eye could see.`
`{n}However, they who could understand things that people couldn't perceive, were able to recognize the dramatic change...`
`"......My lord.`
` My lord...!`
` It is Genji.`
` Please open this door."`
`Genji called in this way after knocking several times, but there was no answer from the study.`
`"Shannon, protect our backs.`
` Kanon, search inside the room."`
`""Yes...!""`
`Kanon put his ear against the door, searching for a presence inside the study.`
`To protect the backs of the other two, who were watching the door, Shannon faced the other way, with her back to them, prepared for the unexpected.`
`"............The Master is here, I believe.`
` ...However, it's too quiet."`
`"Then he is safe?"`
`"No.`
` It is {i:too quiet}."`
`"...It............couldn't be..."`
`"My lord.`
` Excuse us about the door."`
`Genji pulled a gold key out of his pocket.`
`{n}It was the only key to the study that existed, other than the one Kinzo held.`
`He stuck it in the keyhole, and turned it heavily.`
`{n}......At a glance, that would have indicated that it really was a strong lock.`
`However, the fact that the barrier had been destroyed...`
`meant that this door had long been wide open for anyone with magical power...`
`The lock made a heavy sound, indicating that the door had been opened {i:to humans as well}.`
`"......Excuse me."`
`As Genji respectfully bowed his head,`
` and Kanon's sense of tension grew tighter,`
` and Shannon acted nervous, they entered the study...`
`They immediately discovered Kinzo's figure.`
`......He was sitting in a reception sofa so that his back faced them.`
`Genji noticed the person sitting across from him, and again bowed deeply.`
`Kanon also noticed that person,`
` ......and he didn't bow his head.`
`He went in front of Shannon and spread both arms, blocking the way to her.`
`So without even seeing that person's face, Shannon already had a good idea who it was...`
`"...So you have come.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"Genji, is it?`
` You came very quickly.`
` Yes, it is better when furniture answers its master's call quickly.`
` Very different from this person."`
`"........................`
` ......So Ronove‐sama has come as well."`
`Genji directed his greeting towards the thin darkness behind and to the right of {f:5:Beatrice}, where nothing appeared to be.`
`Even Kanon and Shannon couldn't have imagined that someone would be there.`
`......However, the darkness answered immediately, and praised Genji's eyesight...`
`"As usual, you don't disappoint.`
` It has been quite some time.`
` .........Dear me, you have gotten old, haven't you?`
` Have you really reached that age?"`
`"I have lived a full life.`
` ...It appears that your life has grown to be even more full, Ronove‐sama."`
`"Yes.`
` Thank you.`
` .........And Shannon, it has been a long time since I last saw you, as well.`
` You have grown quite beautiful.`
` And, it seems that you have grown quite strong.`
` It is good to see."`
`"............Thank you very much."`
`"......Nee‐san, who in the world..."`
`"This will be the first time I have met you, Kanon‐kun.`
` ......I have been entrusted with the position of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's head furniture. My name is Ronove.`
` ......I am an old friend of Genji‐san's.`
` I am also furniture, just like you.`
` Although the master I serve is different."`
`The color of tension didn't disappear from Kanon's expression in the slightest.`
`......Serving under a different master, furniture could become kind, brutal, or anything else as desired.`
`...If he called himself furniture serving the hated {f:5:Beatrice},`
` then surely he was a despicable being as well...`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` It seems that I'm completely despised.`
` It's as though you hate everything to do with me."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} openly sneered at Kanon's hate‐filled face...`
`Then, Kanon finally observed.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} and Kinzo were enjoying a chess game, sitting in facing reception sofas.`
`But Kinzo hadn't even quivered.`
` He was holding his head with both hands, his eyes closed tight, ...as he contemplated his next move.`
`......No, was he in anguish...?`
`".........My lord........."`
`"I have told Kinzo two things.`
` There was good news and bad news.`
` ......The good news was that he would have the fortune of being reunited with me before the ritual even ends.`
` The bad news was that Kinzo had been selected for the very first sacrifice of the ceremony."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` There's absolutely nothing I can do about it.`
` Because it truly was decided by the fickle roulette."`
`"...L‐liar.`
` You just take pleasure in killing people......"`
`"Stop it, Kanon‐kun......"`
`"......So, Kinzo.`
` Isn't it about time you decided to accept your loss?`
` ......*cackle*, by this, our long lasting contest is resolved, right?"`
`"................................."`
`At a glance, you couldn't tell the current situation on that chaotic chessboard.`
`...However, judging from Kinzo's anguish and {f:5:Beatrice}'s malicious relaxedness,`
` it looked as though it was already decided...`
`"............It is unavoidable...`
` ...Is this also entertainment?"`
`"It is to me too.`
` ......Concluding my contest with you may bring a flood of emotions, but it has already surpassed love and hate.`
` ...It was fun.`
` Several decades that were not boring...!"`
`{f:5:Beatrice} advanced her queen, and made her final move.`
`......It was thus...`
`decided.`
`"Checkmate.`
` .........This is a final tribute from me to you.`
` Without reserve,`
` ...sleep."`
`"Heheheh,`
` ......fuhahaha,`
` haah`
`hah`
`hah`
`hah`
`hah`
`hah`
`hah!!"`
`Kinzo suddenly stood up and laughed, like an opera singer facing a full crowd and spreading his arms,`
` ...as though he had succeeded in a century‐long plan.`
`That laugh...`
`...spat crimson.`
`Crimson flames poured out from inside him,`
` spitting even out of his mouth, ears, and nose, and all at once, his body was wrapped in hellfire...`
`But Kinzo kept laughing.`
`The more he laughed, the more the hellfire spewed from his entire body, and began to char him...`
`Those flames became a brilliant light,`
` which dazzlingly shone on the various magic tools throughout the room, and made their distorted shadows dance across the walls.`
`...Those shadows looked like the dead in hell, in ecstasy over Kinzo as he burned...`
`And,`
` for one who had made a contract with a witch,`
` and who had reached the end of that contract,`
` ...it was an extremely fitting end...`
`After laughing and howling in the roaring flames for some time,`
` Kinzo flopped to the ground, as though he was a puppet whose strings had been cut.`
`Those incredible blazing flames disappeared as though they had burned up everything there was to burn,`
` and afterwards, all that was left was a festering and burnt body that would make you want to avert your eyes...`
`".....................Horrible..."`
`"Hmph.`
` You should talk.`
` Even though you think that was a fitting way for him to die..."`
`"......Why have you shown yourself...?`
` Do you have some business with us...?"`
`"Stop it, Kanon‐kun.`
` ......You must not provoke {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"It appears that you have completely terrified them.`
` Pu ku ku ku."`
`"It seems I just can't get along with Kanon.`
` A pity, I must say I quite like him myself...?"`
`{f:5:Beatrice} smiled broadly, or perhaps wickedly.`
`Kanon violently averted his gaze, obviously disturbed.`
`...His reaction was so different from what he had obviously intended that it made the witch and her butler laugh.`
`"Kanon.`
` ......You stand in the presence of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` Carefully consider your manner of speech."`
`"Oh, there is no problem, Genji.`
` Let him say as he likes.`
` I am gracious."`
`"......How are you gracious...!"`
`"I am always gracious to those who are about to die.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`Kanon was brought to sudden realization by that creepy laughter...`
`{f:5:Beatrice}'s reason for being here was not just to take Kinzo's life.`
`The first twilight required six sacrifices.`
`{n}Kinzo alone wasn't nearly enough.`
`{n}...And they had just nonchalantly come to this place...`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Don't worry, Kanon.`
` ......You won't be selected as sacrifices just because you came here.`
` ......It was because you were selected as sacrifices that you were called here...!"`
`".........What.........!"`
`They instinctively figured it out immediately...`
`Six sacrifices were required for the first twilight.`
`{n}After Kinzo, how many more would you need to add up to six?`
`......In this mansion, the number 5 instantly made them think of the number of servants here...`
`"............Is that...what you desire?"`
`"Mmhm.`
` ...Thank me, furniture.`
` Your days of suffering have tonight finally come to an end.`
` You should thank me, as I have come to tell you this."`
`".........Certainly.`
` If that is your desire."`
`"...G‐`
`......Genji‐sama..."`
`Genji had agreed to the witch's heartless announcement in his usual manner, without raising an eyebrow.`
`"After the Master's death, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is our master.`
` Answering her demand is our final duty.`
` ......Shannon.`
` Kanon.`
` You have done well serving until today.`
` That hard work is now over."`
`"......As I expected of you, Genji.`
` As fellow furniture, I think honorably of you."`
`"Shannon.`
` ......Do you have any objections?"`
`"......No."`
`".........I heard that George‐sama gave you a ring.`
` Even so, you have no regrets?"`
`"No.`
` ......That blessing was more than furniture deserves.`
` ...Just receiving the ring has already fulfilled my feelings."`
`Shannon had not yet reached as high of a philosophical state of mind as Genji.`
` There probably really were regrets left in her heart.`
` ...She probably wanted to spend a little more warm time with the person of her thoughts, George.`
`......But she released herself from that.`
` She took a single deep breath, and from that point on, the expression she wore was blank.`
`"...............Very good."`
`"I am a little surprised that you have been able to calm yourself this much, Shannon.`
` It seems that you have also come to terms with things as furniture."`
`"Won't you at least shed some bitter tears for not being able to spend a night with the man you love?`
` What a boring woman."`
`"............`
` .........This feeling cannot be understood by the likes of you, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` ......If you desire our lives, please accept them.`
` We will solemnly carry out that duty."`
`"......Good.`
` Well said..."`
`"Pu ku ku ku.`
` Just the type of person {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is bad with."`
`"Recently, this one has become quite detached.`
` ...It seems that I tortured her too much last time.`
` Speaking of which, didn't I do the same to Battler?"`
`"...Hmmm.`
` Am I still soft?`
` Or is my style of cornering them lacking?`
` In any case, she's just no fun."`
`".........However, it seems that you will still entertain me, right?`
` Kanooon?"`
`"............Kanon‐kun..."`
`".................."`
`Compared to the two who had attained a philosophical state of mind, ...there was a painful anguish on Kanon's face.`
`Kanon was still far too young to accept his demise without regrets,`
` after being told of it by a suddenly appearing witch...`
`"......Kanon.`
` I detest boredom more than anything.`
` And it isn't interesting that those other two have obediently accepted their deaths.`
` ......So I don't want you to betray my expectations."`
`"............Are you trying to make me your plaything...?"`
`Kanon realized that he was being provoked.`
`...However, no matter how much anger spurred him on, his opponent was a witch.`
` He was furniture.`
` He had no chance of victory from the beginning.`
`But the witch was expecting that he would struggle in vain and writhe around,`
` and was looking forward to it...`
`......Just thinking about that was frustrating enough to get his blood boiling.`
`Was disappointing the witch by refusing to resist, like the other two,`
` the only way he could strike back at her...?`
`"Eldest of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, Lucifer.`
` Arise."`
`"......Lucifer the Proud, right here."`
`"Kanon.`
` It would be too cruel to force furniture to fight a witch.`
` No matter how much anger spurs you on, you could hardly hold hope in a battle you have no chance of winning.`
` Of course, a battle without a chance of success would be boring for me as well."`
`"......So, furniture against furniture.`
` Why not resolve it with a battle between furniture?`
` That should be enough to allow you some hope for victory, right...?"`
`"..................`
` ...With all due respect, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` Is it truly possible that I could yield to this good‐for‐nothing furniture?"`
`"As if this cute kid would have any chance in hell against me...`
` Eheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheheh."`
`".................................kh."`
`"Show me that you can defeat my furniture of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory.`
` If you manage to come out the admirable victor,`
` .........hm, let us see..."`
`"I will let you have free choice over the five people who will escape becoming one of the 13 sacrifices.`
` I will unconditionally welcome the five people you recommend into the Golden Land.`
` ...How about that?"`
`Kanon understood that he was being provoked.`
`{n}......However, the witch's condition was very tempting.`
`The evil ritual the witch and the rest were trying to carry out was, at this point,`
` not something that Kanon cared about in the slightest.`
`......On the contrary, it was much more important for him to survive, be invited to the Golden Land,`
` ...and have his wish granted by {f:5:Beatrice} there...`
`"You cried that you'd had enough of being furniture, right...?`
` I shall grant your desire.`
` I shall give you that human body which you wanted so much that you cried yourself to sleep.`
` What do you say...?`
` Then you could be together with Jessica, right?`
` Ooh, just perfect.`
` You may include Jessica and yourself in the five you recommend for invitation to the Golden Land."`
`"......If you have some hesitation toward making only yourself happy,`
` then you can add Shannon and her loved one, George, as well.`
` If you're worried about duty, then you can also add Genji."`
`"Hoh!`
` That's five people.`
` Just enough room, Kanon.`
` .........With this much of a reward, ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` You won't let me get bored, will youuuu...?"`
`"......She's just playing with you.`
` There is no need to listen to her."`
`"I, ......I'm sick of this.`
` Is this really what you want, Nee‐san?!"`
`{f:5:Beatrice} couldn't hide her evil smile at those words.`
`"I'm sick of this.`
` I want to be happy!`
` I've had enough of being furniture.`
` I want to become human, ......and have normal love...!`
` I want to know that...the ocean is blue, like you!"`
`"............How young.`
` I'm jealous."`
`"That's why I like the young ones.`
` ......Genji, Shannon, stay back.`
` Kanon, Lucifer, forward."`
`"As you command."`
`".............................."`
`"...Hehheheheheheheheheheheh.`
` I don't like it.`
` ...You know you can't win against {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama,`
` but you look down on me as though you might be able to win against me...`
` ......I {i:really} don't like it."`
`That was probably humiliating to Lucifer.`
`...But at the same time, she was also happy that she was so lucky to have this lovely prey all to herself...`
`".........Come, furniture of the witch.`
` .........Don't think that you can look down on me forever...!"`
`"Come, now, Battler.`
` It is time for another fun show!`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`".........Damn.`
` It's turned into something ridiculous again...`
` Like I'd ever accept that it's a magic battle...!"`
`"Look, look, don't turn your eyes away, look at it.`
` Look look, look look!`
` It's magic, it's furniture,`
` no matter how much you try to deny me and magic,`
` look look, look look look look!"`
`"All this bwaan bwaan, ka‐shing ka‐shing, right in front of your eyes, it was all for nothing, riiiight?`
` Look look look look,`
` stop thinking already,`
` I told you magic exists!`
` I told you this is fantasy!`
` Don't close your eyes,`
` look closely,`
` look look look look look!!"`
`"Damn it, damn it damn it damn it...`
` I won't accept witches, I won't accept magic...!`
` But if it's as obvious as this, what the hell am I meant to say?!`
` ...............Damn, damndamndamn!"`
`"Come now, don't turn away, look closely, alriiiight??`
` Magic exists, it's fantasy, stop playing detective."`
`"I know all about it, the truth is you're awful at thinking about things, riiight??`
` Just stop, just stoooop, *cackle*cackle*!`
` Look look, obviously fantasy, obviously fantasy, kihhihi{0}hya{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyaa{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!"`
`"Shut up shut up shut uuuuuuuuuuup...!!!`
` Don't talk to meeeeeeee...!!"`
`".........This guy's gotten obstinate.`
` ...Get down on the ground right now and apologize for being so conceited that you thought you could "at least beat me".`
` If you do, I'll spare you, alright...?"`
`"I'll spare you from having your skin ripped off while you're still alive,`
` and being lashed all over your body as you squirm until you die.`
` Hehheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheheh!"`
`"You're a cute kid, so apologize...`
` If you do, you can spend your last moments in blissful, wonderful ecstasy as I gently, gently finish you off......"`
`"Be silent, furniture of the witch.`
` ...I have no intention of speaking with you."`
`"S‐......so you say that you think nothing of me, do you...?"`
`"Hehhheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheheh, I don't like it, that disrespectful gaze of yours...`
` I really don't like iiiiit!!"`
`"............Kanon‐kun..............."`
`"..........................."`
`"......Isn't he stronger than he was against Satan?"`
`"That is why humans are so frightening.`
` Sometimes they even become witches, and treat demons as butlers."`
`"Pu ku ku ku ku!`
` So, which should I cheer on?"`
`"...Are you...`
`......saying that this guy's on par with me...!"`
`".........Don't look down on me.`
` As long as you have that pride, you can never win against me."`
`"Y‐y‐`
`...you speak of Lucifer, the eldest of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, and say that I can never win?!`
` H‐how...conceited!!"`
`"...Wha..............."`
`Kanon was desperately trying to stay alive, and he had the strong desire to become human.`
`But Lucifer didn't feel anything stronger than a slight desire to play.`
`......So, that reached its inevitable result.`
` For the ability to yield such a result is the power of humans.`
` ...The power of the heart.`
`"...............That's as far as you go.`
` You can never win against me."`
`A glowing red trail extended straight out from Kanon's arm,`
` ......pointing at Lucifer's throat, just beneath the tip of her chin...`
`"Wh‐`
`......what is this...?!`
` How could I...`
` ......There...must be some mistake..."`
`As she ground her teeth in irritation, she tried to deny the reality right before her eyes.`
` ...But no matter how much she believed in her own superiority, it didn't change the facts right before her eyes.`
`"Hoh.`
` ...Well done, Kanon.`
` Wonderful, you haven't made me bored.`
` ......How pitiful my furniture is in comparison.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"......Lucifer.`
` You are boring Milady.`
` Was this opponent really too much for you to handle...?"`
`"I'm disappointed, eldest of the Seven Staaakes.`
` Kuhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi...!"`
`That would have seemed like nothing more than a simple rebuke to an outsider.`
`However, furniture serving the witch knew what kind of severe treatment was promised by that rebuke,`
` and understood what had been left unsaid...`
`"Uuuuuuuuuuuguuhhh!!`
` You......good‐for‐nothing FURNITU{-}U{-}U{-}U{-}U{-}U{-}U{-}U{-}U{-}U{-}U{-}UURE!!!"`
`She howled.`
` ...Abandoning her last bit of pride, she made her body explode, exposing her true form.`
`That form was a demon stake, which bounced and deflected off the walls all over the room...`
`"How could you shame me so much!!`
` I'll kill you, kill you kill you kill you!!`
` You slowpoke!`
` Even though you can't even follow my movements anymore!!`
` I won't play around anymore, I'm seriously mad, I'll pierce your heart in one blow!!"`
`"I'll plow right through you, and make a fountain of bright‐red blood reach the ceiling!!`
` DIIIII{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}IIEEEE!!"`
`"Ka‐Kanon‐kun.........!!"`
`With a speed exceeding even the limits that the human eye could follow,`
` Lucifer went wild, and flew at Kanon's heart...`
`Lucifer confirmed that the sweet taste she could feel was definitely Kanon's blood.`
`...But she quickly noticed.`
`{n}...She hadn't pierced Kanon's heart...`
`"............Hoh.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"This is why humans are frightening.`
` ...Would you like some black tea?"`
`"I am fine for now.`
` This is so interesting I don't need black tea...!"`
`"......K‐`
`............Kanon‐kun............"`
`"So arrogant......`
` ......That's why you can't win against me......"`
`The floor was stained with dripping blood.`
`...It really was Kanon's blood,`
` ......but it wasn't flowing out of his chest.`
`Kanon had sacrificed his own left hand to protect his heart...`
`Lucifer was arrogant.`
`Even though she had been given enough time to realize that this was an opponent capable of cornering her,`
` even so, in her pride, she had believed that he was a worthless opponent.`
` She had gotten careless.`
`......So just as she had announced, she had aimed for his chest, trying to pierce his heart.`
`Because she was arrogant, she hadn't even thought of aiming for somewhere other than the place she had announced.`
`...No, maybe she had thought about it a little.`
`{n}...However, her pride would not allow her to aim for a different spot.`
`Because she was...`
`......Lucifer the Proud.`
`Kanon, withstanding the pain,`
` grasped the demon stake sticking deep into his left hand strongly with his right,`
` ...and pulled it out......`
`The sound of breaking bones and even more blood dripping down could be heard.`
`{n}Shannon instinctively averted her eyes.`
`There was an air hole in the back of the pierced hand so big that you could clearly see through to the other side...`
`Kanon's face was filled with agony,`
` ......but in this very moment,`
` he had won, without a doubt.`
`The demon stake he was gripping with his right hand turned back into Lucifer again...`
`Kanon was now gripping exactly where her neck was.`
`".........Ga,`
` ............gu,`
` ..................h..."`
`"...I win.`
` .........{f:5:Beatrice}."`
`Kanon didn't hold back at all with the hand gripping Lucifer's throat.`
`......She had challenged him again after their fight had already been decided.`
`{n}Kanon had no obligation to be considerate.`
`But even so, Kanon released the witch's furniture.`
`......Was it his naive humanism, his pity for another piece of furniture,`
` or a final show of respect to the witch?`
`In any case, when she was released, Lucifer fell face‐down on the ground,`
` and made as if to vomit, moaning over the pain in her throat...`
`"Spectacular, Kanon.`
` ......Your great efforts have gone some way to proving Kinzo's research correct."`
`Ronove was clapping his hands.`
`...To Kanon, who had achieved a difficult victory, incurring a wound on his left hand that couldn't be closed, that applause seemed nothing but shallow.`
`"......All possibilities are hidden in the human heart, was it?`
` .........My, my, this is why humans are frightening!`
` Well done, Kanon.`
` You are victorious.`
` Spectacular!"`
`"......Haah,`
` ......haah,`
` ......haah......"`
`"Are you okay?!`
` Kanon‐kun......"`
`Shannon ran up to him and wrapped a handkerchief around his left hand, which was still spraying blood.`
`"That was spectacular, Kanon!`
` Truly spectacular.`
` I was also slightly hoping for an upset.`
` How truly wonderful you are as furniture not to let me down.`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` I think better of you now.`
` I honestly think better of you!"`
`"Y‐......you better not have forgotten our promise...`
` {f:5:Beatrice}..."`
`"Mhm.`
` Of course I have not forgotten.`
` Witches and demons are admittedly unjust.`
` However, we are much more noble than humans when it comes to our contracts."`
`"I will not go back on my word.`
` I guaranteed that if you won,`
` I would give you the right to decide the five people who will escape becoming the 13 sacrifices."`
`"......B‐{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` I haven't yet...lo—`
`higi!!"`
`{f:5:Beatrice} twirled her pipe, and heaven and earth turned over just for Lucifer.`
`......So as a horribly natural result, she "fell" onto the ceiling.`
`The ceiling doesn't seem that high to people standing on the floor.`
`{n}...However, people who fall on it upside‐down and head‐first surely don't feel the same way...`
`"Milady.`
` Isn't this a little much?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` That may be so.`
` I suppose I will forgive her."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} spun her pipe again.`
`When she did, the magic that had been affecting Lucifer was released.`
`......So as a horribly natural result, this time with extreme legitimacy, she "fell" back onto the floor.`
`"Agah......!!"`
`"............Ku,`
` ............u,`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama,`
` ...f‐...forgive me............"`
`"What are you afraid of?`
` I have already forgiven you, haven't I?`
` *cackle*!`
` So, Kanon.`
` Shall we continue?"`
`".........Continue what?`
` ...You aren't saying that you want me to finish her, are you...?!"`
`"Ah, no, no.`
` It isn't over yet, right?"`
`".........What isn't?`
` ...Stop dodging the question...!!"`
`"I did promise you, didn't I?`
` If you could defeat my furniture, of {i:the Seven Stakes of Purgatory}, riiiiiiight?`
` Come, arise, Seven Stakes of Purgatory.`
` The six younger sisters of the worthless elder sister!"`
`""""""Kyahhahahahahahahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha!!""""""`
`With shrill laughing voices, the air split,`
` and gold sprayed everywhere as the remaining six of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory showed themselves...`
`All of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, only one of which Kanon had been able to defeat by sacrificing his left arm, were gathered...`
`By now, Kanon regretted his thoughtlessness in accepting the witch's challenge.`
`{n}...He had been foolish to assume that a game with a witch would be on an even footing......!`
`"............Laaame‐o.`
` Onee‐sama, why are you crawling on the floor?"`
`"Y‐...you people...............`
`gh......"`
`"See, this is why Onee‐sama's useless.`
` Even though she acts like she's so great as the oldest sister, that's just on the outside."`
`"Yeah, seriously!`
` Lucifer onee‐sama, your disgraceful behavior will damage others' opinions about all of us!`
` Know your shame!`
` You novice!"`
`"............Ku, .........gu......"`
`"Kanon‐ku~n, awesome awesome.`
` But don't get cocky, okay?`
` Lucifer onee‐sama just brags all the time, she's no big deal compared to the rest of us sisters."`
`"...That's why I'm always saying Lucifer‐nee shouldn't do anything.`
` It's alright if she just brags all the time.`
` Because we superior ones always have to clean up the fighting scenes."`
`"What are you gonna do, Onee‐sama?`
` We respect your pride,`
` so we were planning on letting you challenge him again in that beaten‐up body without getting in the way..."`
`"......But Kanon‐kun sure is strong, right?`
` Right now, no matter how much you struggle, there's no way you can win, right...?"`
`"......Y‐`
`.........you peopleee............"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` My, my, you sisters are always so lively.`
` Is now really the time for discord?"`
`"Being a 7‐person unit is what makes you the Seven Sisters of Purgatory.`
` Now play nice and execute the task I gave you.`
` Swiftly, alright?"`
`"Come on, Lucifer onee‐sama.`
` If you want to borrow the power of your little sisters...`
` Say it, okay?`
` We want to hear you ask us for help from your own mouth."`
`"Kh, ............you plan to mock me even more.........?!"`
`"‘I, the foolish—`
`weak—`
`ugly—`
`shaaameful!—`
`eldest sister Lucifer, beg my younger sisters to save me’.`
` ......C'mon, let's hear it.`
` If you let us hear that, we'll save you.`
` That's a deal, right?`
` Everyone?!"`
`"......You.........`
`...b‐`
`......bitcheees......"`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory taunted their elder sister, calling her worthless.`
` Verbally abusing her.`
`...Even Kanon, who had been fighting her for his life until a second ago, couldn't bear to look straight at it...`
`"A‐as i—`
`......as if I...`
`...could say...`
`...something like that......"`
`"Do it quickly.`
` Obviously we won't get anywhere with you alone.`
` Hurry up and slay Kanon as the Seven Sisters."`
`"Pu ku ku ku...`
` Oh, what could be wrong, Lucifer?`
` It is an order from Milady, you know?"`
`"............How cruel."`
`Lucifer ground her teeth over and over, hurled curses at her sisters, and then,`
` ...............as she trembled all over,`
` ......she answered her sisters' request...`
`"...I, ............I, the foolish,`
` ......weak,`
` .........ugly...`
` ...uuuu...!"`
`"Shaaaameful!!"`
`"Sh‐...shameful,`
` ......eldest sister Lucifer,`
` ......beg...`
` .........uuuuuuuughhuhu!!`
` Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...!!"`
`She was finally unable to endure saying those degrading words,`
` ...and the girl bearing the name of Pride broke down crying.`
`However, the six younger sisters kept giggling coldheartedly.`
`"Heyyyy!`
` Don't try to trick us by crying!`
` You haven't finished saying iiiit!"`
`"That should be enough.`
` Come, sisters, let us display our power."`
`"I won't be satisfied until I hear the whole thing, you know?!`
` C'mon, c'mon, Onee‐sama, keep going!"`
`"That's enough!`
` Come on, this shame has been brought upon all of us sisters!`
` We won't let them return alive!"`
`"Alright, how should we play with this pitiful furniture?`
` Any wonderful suggestiooons?"`
`"Meee, me!`
` Beelze thiiinks...the seven of us shouuuld...get along and split Kanon up between us!"`
`"Good plan.`
` ......That way all of the sisters can get along."`
`"Then I'll take the head!`
` All of you can have the limbs!!"`
`"No no, noooooooooooo!!`
` {i:I} get the heaaaad!!"`
`"You know there's no way there'll be any meaning to promises like that!`
` It's obviously gonna be first one there wins!"`
`"Kuhihihihi!!`
` Kanon‐kun, if you have a suggestion for how you'd like to be killed, just tell us, okay?`
` We Seven Sisters will kill you in an awwwwesome way!"`
`"...........................Damn......"`
`"......Aaarrrrrrgggh!!`
` You've shamed me so much!!`
` Even slicing you into eight pieces won't be enough!!`
` I'll slice you into a hundred pieces!!`
` Here we go, everyone!!"`
`""""""Yeees, Onee‐sama!`
` Kyahhahahahahahaha!!""""""`
`The seven of them burst at once.`
`{n}They had no desire to play or boast.`
`{n}This time, they would genuinely follow their master's order.`
`...Slay Kanon. Swiftly!`
`The Seven Sisters jumped around the room faster than the eye could see, deciding how they would kill Kanon.`
`They tortured Kanon with their cruel giggles, sometimes making a close pass at him.`
`...They kept scraping his arms, shoulders, and cheeks,`
` carving red lines into his body...`
`At that time, Shannon dashed up behind him, holding on to him so that she blocked the way to his body at least a little.`
`"{nobreak:{m:-5:—}—}Kh......!!"`
`"Ah......?!"`
`At the same time, a red cylinder wrapped around the two of them, like a beam of light sent from heaven.`
` That cylinder repelled the evil ones who tormented Kanon...`
`"Whaaaat!!`
` That's cheeatiiing!`
` This has nothing to do with youuu!"`
`"Oh, I know what this is.`
` She must want to play with us."`
`"Kyahha!`
` Then I'll take her!`
` Aaall mine!!"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` May we have Shannon as our prey...?"`
`"Hm?`
` Aah, I don't mind, do as you like.`
` It seems Kanon alone won't be enough to satisfy your gluttony."`
`"I am so very grateful.`
` Come on, I'll make you regret coming out uninvited!"`
`"I'll turn you to scraps of meat so shredded you can't even tell who's who,`
` mix you and mix you and mince you into hamburgers!"`
`"Idiot, breaking that barrier comes first!`
` Do your job before you start worrying about food!"`
`""""Yees, Onee‐sama!!""""`
`"Gu......uuu......!!"`
`As a horribly natural first action, the Seven Sisters began to destroy the barrier Shannon had created.`
`...Shannon's barrier certainly was extremely strong.`
`{n}It was enough power to impress even {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`...It was strong enough that frail furniture would turn to dust just by touching it,`
` and it was firm, like a tree with deep roots.`
`But no matter how big a tree gets, it will eventually surrender to a saw or a hatchet.`
`{n}For the Seven Sisters, "chopping down" Shannon's barrier, while it was a pain, was not impossible.`
`"Hnf......!!"`
`The sound, like beetles jumping around, grew even more fierce and filled the room.`
`They cut up and steadily eroded away that red barrier, as though with a hatchet, a saw, no, a chainsaw by now...`
`"............How foolish.`
` You must have known that your barrier can't fully protect you from these girls.`
` Why...?"`
`".........Because I can't just let it happen."`
`Shannon spoke back resolutely as she covered Kanon, who was already spent of all his energy and sprawled on the floor.`
`"If you hadn't barged in uninvited, I would have given you a sleeplike death.`
` Why have you deliberately exposed yourself to the Seven Sisters?"`
`"......All death is not equal, you know?`
` You realize an intense death tortures you even after you die?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"............Go ahead, do as you like.`
` Just like you do as you want, I have done as I wanted."`
`"........................`
` ......Hmmmm.`
` Somehow, you simply lack entertainment value recently, you know?`
` The most interesting part about love is during the time when it's uncertain whether or not you will achieve it."`
`"After achieving it, a woman is like salmon who has finished laying its eggs.`
` I have already tired of you."`
`"Thank you.`
` No words I could hear from a witch would make me happier."`
`"......Hehehehhihihahaha.`
` Then, at least in the end, show me a way of dying that will please me greatly."`
`"Seven Sisters, did you hear that?!`
` Show me the limits of your brutality in the way you kill Shannon!!"`
`"...............Shannon..."`
`"......My apologies.`
` In the end, I wasn't able to match up to your greatness, Genji‐sama."`
`".........You're an idiot, Nee‐san...`
` If you'd just left me be, ...then you might not have met this horrible..."`
`"No, it's alright.`
` ...I was able to receive the ring from George‐sama, and live as a woman.`
` I was able to protect you, and live as a sister.`
` With this, my life is settled with no regrets."`
`"......Nnnngggggaaaaaaaaahhhh, you're pissing me off.`
` That philosophic view is really irritating!!`
` This is why you're furniture you don't even smell like a humaaaaaan!!"`
`"Look at {i:me}, {i:I} am human!!`
` Don't spout off philosophical stuff like you're more complete than I am, you furnituuuuuuuuuuure!!"`
`"............How ugly.`
` Is that regret your true form?"`
`"It's not a regreeeeeet, this is called LIVING!!`
` You received a ring, so it's alright if you die, what?!`
` Aaaaah, I can't understand it, not a clue not a hope, goddamn astonished, goddamn shocked, no goddamn good at aa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aalll!!"`
`"......Milady, I might suggest you are acting somewhat undignified."`
`"Shut up, furniture!!`
` Shannooooonn, do you think I'll let you die easilyyyyyyyyyyy?!`
` Now's the time to bite your tooooooongue!!"`
`"............How pitiful.`
` If you can see yourself reflected in my eyes,`
` then shudder at your own ugliness."`
`"Don't worry,`
` I'll crush you mush you mash you up so you're even uglier, while you're still aliii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiive!!!"`
`At that time, .........Genji softly entered the red barrier.`
`{n}Maybe that barrier didn't block those without ill intent.`
`Then Genji...softly held Shannon from behind,`
` ......and covered her eyes with his right hand.`
`"............Genji‐sama..."`
`"You have done enough now...`
` .........Go to sleep before me."`
`"............Yes.`
` .........Thank you very much, Genji‐sama..."`
`".........Mhm."`
`After that, Genji softly pressed his left hand against the area around her collarbone...`
`......As he did, from the area where that left hand pressed,`
` ......a crimson stain gently spread out.`
`When Genji removed his hand,`
` .........bright‐red fresh blood oozed out of there.`
`For just the very first instant, it appeared to be shaped like a crimson rose...`
`And when he removed the right hand that covered Shannon's eyes,`
` .........there was a peaceful expression on her face, as though she was sleeping.`
`......And she fell softly,`
` ...silently down,`
` .........and slept.`
`Her soul had already been sent to a world where the malicious witch and her furniture could never reach her,`
` no matter how evilly they tortured her...`
`{f:5:Beatrice} and the Seven Sisters were shocked by this scene.`
`{n}...Only Ronove had a mysterious expression along with his smile.`
`Then Genji leaned over Kanon, who was crouching on the floor.`
`".........You did well.`
` You, too, should sleep now."`
`".................................`
` ............Yes.`
` Thank you very much, Genji‐sama."`
`Just as he had done with Shannon, after gently covering Kanon's eyes with his hand,`
` Genji gently covered the area around Kanon's collarbone with his other hand.`
`......And when that was removed with the lightness of a feather,`
` ...there was a crimson rose shape.`
`But that rose shape quickly turned into the stain of bright‐red blood pouring out...`
`"Wh‐`
`............what is...that......"`
`"......What a boring person.`
` ...The fun of a balloon of life is in poking it with a needle and making it forcefully explode."`
`"Spectacular, Genji.`
` ............You truly are furniture."`
`"......Thank you very much.`
` ...Well then, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, Ronove‐sama.`
` With this as my final task, allow me to rest."`
`"............Grr.`
` You took what I was playing with.`
` All of that thrashing and mashing I wanted to do to them,`
` I hope you're willing to take all that instead??"`
`{f:5:Beatrice} faced him with an unsatisfied expression,`
` but Ronove spoke quietly to Genji with a soothing smile.`
`"You have worked hard.`
` You are my greatest servant.`
` ......I shall bestow as a final gift to you a peaceful sleep worthy of all your labors until now."`
`"Wha?!`
` Wait, what are you...!"`
`When Ronove snapped his fingers,`
` ......as if Genji was a puppet that had crumpled from its strings being cut,`
` ...suddenly, and yet gently...`
`He fell, sprawled on the floor, into a sleep that witches couldn't call him back from...`
`That was as filled with kindness as the sleep he had given Shannon and Kanon...`
`"......What was that, Ronove?`
` ......What a boring anticlimax."`
`"Are you not a powerful Great Witch, Milady?`
` Something such as this is not enough to pay attention to.`
` ......It is not like you to allow the blood to rush to your head because of provocation from someone like Shannon."`
`"...........................`
` ...hmph."`
`What was there that {f:5:Beatrice} didn't like?`
`{n}...Was she still unable to remove the thorn of Shannon's words?`
`Ronove laughed lightly, as though lamenting the complexity of the human and the female heart, and ordered the Seven Sisters to go.`
`......After all, there were still two sacrifices left for the first twilight.`
`The Seven Sisters cavorted as they disappeared...`
