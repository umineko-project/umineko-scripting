`...Thirty minutes had already passed since Rudolf's group had left the guesthouse.`
`By any measure, their return was too late.`
`{n}...And Krauss and Natsuhi, who were waiting by the entrance, were by now about as restless as they could stand.`
`The chain was set on the door.`
` That was a precaution in the event that Rudolf's group was attacked, and the master key was stolen from them.`
`For that reason, they needed to wait by the entrance like this for the others to return...`
`"......They really are taking too long.`
` You don't think something happened to them...?"`
`"...............Hmm..."`
`Krauss glanced between the clock and the door, struggling to feign composure.`
`"If...by some chance they were not to return......"`
`"...A terrible thought, but it looks as though we should ready ourselves for that possibility.`
` ......It really was reckless, after all."`
`"Th‐that is what I said...!`
` Why did they go outside when they knew it was this dangerous...!`
` How foolish!`
` Why go outside, even though Rosa‐san had just been attacked...?!!"`
`".........Nothing will come from saying that now.`
` ...In any event, there are now three adults in the guesthouse.`
` Me, you,`
` ......and Eva, who's asleep with a high fever."`
`At that time, there was the forceful sound from the hallway of a door being opened, and Eva's shrieking voice.`
`...That voice kept calling Hideyoshi's name.`
` ......It seemed as though the high fever had given her a bad dream or something, and now she was calling her husband's name.`
`"Eva‐san...`
`what is it, are you alright...?"`
`"Wh‐...where is my husband?!`
` My husband isn't here!!`
` He promised that he'd stay with me the whole time!`
` He promised that he'd hold my hand the whole time!!"`
`...Krauss was taken aback by this attitude of hers, which she had never shown in front of him before, but Natsuhi understood her feelings.`
`"......C‐calm down...`
` Hideyoshi‐san is with Rudolf‐san and Kyrie‐san, and they're outside right now."`
`"Outside?!?!`
` Whwh‐why,`
` he promised that he'd stay with me the whole time,`
` why did he go outside?!`
` You mustn't go outside, the witch is outside, you mustn't go, you'll be killed!!`
` Waaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaagg{0}g{0}g{0}g{0}g{0}gghhh...!!"`
`"...Eva, calm yourself.`
` ......Hideyoshi‐san is back in the mansion with Rudolf and Kyrie‐san."`
`"Why did he have to go to the mansion?!!`
` Why did you let him outside when it's safe in here?!!`
` Why did he go back to the mansion?!!"`
`"..................`
` ......They went to get enough food to last until tomorrow.`
` ...Hideyoshi‐san was worried about your health, and he told us so..."`
`"When will they come back?!`
` When will he come back?!`
` He can't go outside, not to the rose garden, not to the mansion!!`
` The witch is there, the Golden Witch is walking around!`
` If she finds him he'll be killed, he'll definitely be killed!!`
` When will my husband come back?!"`
`".........They left here thirty minutes ago.`
` We are waiting for their return."`
`"Th‐thirty minutes?!`
` That makes no sense, why would it take him so much time to go to the mansion, get food, and come back?!`
` And why are you two just standing around here?!"`
`"We have to go get him!!`
` Quick, we have to go to where he is!!`
` Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!"`
`Eva had probably had quite a nightmare.`
` ...And after waking up and discovering that it still wasn't over, she could no longer hide her confusion.`
`Natsuhi tried calming her down, but it only made Eva's emotions explode all the more.`
`......Maybe they heard that disturbance.`
` The lobby door opened slightly, and Battler and the kids, who should have been upstairs, poked their faces out.`
`Krauss, Natsuhi, Eva.`
` And Battler, George, Jessica, Nanjo.`
`{n}...Everyone in the guesthouse was gathered by the entrance, and understood the current situation.`
`"I agree with Mother.`
` We should go to check on Father and the others."`
`"Yeah, you're right.`
` There's also the chance that their load is too heavy and they're having trouble carrying it.`
` They should welcome some extra hands."`
`"......R‐Rosa‐san was attacked not long ago.`
` ...There's a possibility that this is a second disaster.`
` We should act with caution here and—"`
`"Don't be ridiculous!!`
` Act with caution and {i:what}?!`
` Are you saying we should stand by and let my husband die when he might be praying for help?!`
` I'm going to look, the cowards can stay here!!"`
`Looking agitated, Eva raised her gun.`
`{n}Judging by her expression, it would be useless for anyone to try to stop her.`
`...George, who realized that first, raised his head.`
`"I'll go too.`
` You will too, right, Battler‐kun?`
` The more people, the better...!"`
`"S‐sure!!`
` Auntie Eva, we're coming even if you tell us not to."`
`"...I, I'm coming too...!`
` I'll be damned if I'm gonna be the only one hiding where it's safe...!"`
`"Jessica, you must not go outside!!`
` You are to stay here with me.`
` Do you understand?!"`
`She was essentially implying that those three had already been killed anyway, so it was pointless to go outside.`
`Natsuhi also realized that she had made a deep gouge in Eva's heart, but she said those words strongly as Jessica's mother.`
`"..................You're right.`
` That would probably be best.`
` Nii‐san, you and your family keep watch over the guesthouse."`
`"This is my family's and Battler‐kun's family's problem.`
` And I wonder if Doctor Nanjo would come too.`
` Just in case of the worst."`
`".........In the hall of the mansion, Battler, Eva, George, and Nanjo...`
`found the bodies of Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi."`
`".........The fourth twilight through the sixth twilight?`
` Then, the corpses were pierced through the forehead, chest, and stomach with those demon stakes?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......Into Rudolf's forehead,`
` into Hideyoshi's chest,`
` and into Kyrie's stomach: one demon stake buried into each."`
`"The clothing on all three was disordered, and because of this, it is thought that they had been fighting or running away.`
` Since the three bodies were not found right next to each other, it is hypothesized that after coming into contact with the culprit, they attempted some form of resistance."`
`".........With stakes, in the forehead, chest, and stomach.`
` ......Horrible, just like usual..."`
`"................................."`
`Even though Ronove knew it would be superfluous, he thought that maybe he should tell Battler.`
`...In actuality, the witch had killed them in a much more horrible way.`
`......Beato had advised the witch to restrain herself, which was why the corpses had been left so undamaged.`
`The new and brutal witch, thinking that all she needed to do was get the "gouged with a stake" part right,`
` ......might even have just stuck a stake into a lump of meat that wasn't even shaped like a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
`Rosa's and Maria's corpses would probably have been especially striking.`
` ...If they had been killed as the Golden Witch had wished, just how gruesome would the exposed corpses have been?`
`Beato had changed that into a kind of killing that Battler would have called "still better".`
`Wanting to have Beato's small bit of thoughtfulness appreciated, he thought of telling Battler about that.`
`...But, for Battler, that might do more harm than good.`
` To humans, the gap between being alive and being dead is very large.`
`To ask for Beato's feelings to be accommodated on the grounds that she had changed it to a better way of dying...`
`might have made it possible for a demon to pardon her, ......but there was no way it would work the same way for a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
`Understanding this, Ronove remained silent even though he knew of Beato's modest effort...`
`"Just like usual, let's start by checking whether the corpses are dead.`
` ......Ronove, please, declare it in red."`
`"...................................."`
`"Hey, can't you hear me?`
` ...Please, declare it in red.`
` This is a repetition request.`
` "Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi are dead"."`
`"...............My apologies.`
` Allow me to decline from repeating that."`
`"What...?`
` That's so sudden... What are you planning...?"`
`By now, proclaiming the death of the victims in red was almost a given in this battle.`
`Refusing to do that was almost like losing by default.`
`...So when Ronove declined as his first move, Battler was dumbfounded.`
`"My apologies.`
` I hereby humbly relinquish my right to be Milady's agent.`
` ...Accordingly, {i:I} cannot repeat that in red.`
` ......The only one qualified to repeat that...is Milady."`
`"........................"`
`"...It is a valid point.`
` Ronove is but an agent for Beato's side.`
` ......If Ronove steps down from the position of agent, and Battler‐kun will not accept Beato as an opponent,`
` ...a new agent must be created."`
`"......There is no new agent.`
` ......Please, Battler‐sama.`
` Please accept Milady as your game partner once more."`
`"............Sorry,`
` but that's not happening.`
` ......I definitely won't accept that unpleasant, ruthless bitch as my opponent.`
` ...Refusing to accept that is the reason I won't abandon this game."`
`"Regarding your point about Milady being unpleasant, I apologize in her stead.`
` I shall obtain Milady's pledge that she will not take unpleasant actions again."`
`"..............................`
` ......Yeah, right."`
`"...Battler‐kun.`
` ...I also apologize as that child's master.`
` I will give her a thorough talking‐to, so would you please forgive her just this once?"`
`"......Hey, hey, quit that.`
` You're making it sound like I'm the bad guy."`
`"...And no matter how much {i:you guys} apologize, it won't reach my ears.`
` ......If Beato can say that from her own mouth,`
` ............well, it's not like I'm not gonna listen to her."`
`"............Alright.`
` If that is the only condition under which you will accept that child again, let us have her apologize."`
`".........Ronove.`
` Call for that child.`
` Is that alright, Battler‐kun...?"`
`"...............Tch.`
` ...Do whatever you want.`
` But don't expect me to forgive her.`
` ......Go on, call for that irritating witch."`
`"...You have my thanks, Battler‐sama.`
` .........I will call her now.`
` ......Milady, Battler‐sama is calling for you."`
`After a few heartbeats, gold butterflies gathered together in midair and created Beato's form.`
`...It was much more docile than the way she had appeared before now.`
`"............Did you call, Ronove?"`
`"...I believe you heard.`
` ......Is there anything you have to say, from your own mouth...?"`
`"...................................."`
`".............................."`
`It looked as though Beato shrunk slightly under Battler's cold gaze.`
`Several times, Beato made an effort to get the words out of her mouth, but that didn't work so well,`
` ......and she was just as awkward as someone trying to light a match during a freezing winter with frozen hands...`
`Even as she did that, the game board was proceeding...`
`In the hall, they had just found the bodies of the new victims, and had broken down crying...`
`"......Dad,`
` ......Kyrie‐san...`
` ...UooOO{0}O{0}O{0}OOoo{0}ooO{0}OOo{0}oohhhh...`
` UOOOOooo{0}ooOO{0}OOoo{0}oohhhhh..."`
`"Oh honey, ...honeyyyy... uuu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}huu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}uughhhu{0}uuhu{0}uhuu...!!"`
`"...Mother,`
` ......stay strong......`
` ......You're not the only one who's...`
`...crushed and...`
`...sad......!"`
`"........................They probably died instantly.`
` ...Even if we had arrived immediately after they fell, I am sure that it would have been too late..."`
`"No, it wouldn't!!`
` He would definitely have been alive!!`
` His chest was stabbed with this thing...!`
` My husband must have died in extreme pain...!!"`
`"If we had come faster, ...he would have been saved, I just know it!`
` I just know it!!`
` Uuuuuwa{0}aAAAaa{0}aaAA{0}AAaa{0}aa{0}aahhh..."`
`"...Battler‐kun... I know it's horrible, but......you have to stay strong......"`
`"...............I'm fine, ...I really am, Aniki...`
` ...Let me cry just a bit longer...`
` ......Compared to you people, this is nothing...`
` I should be the least sad...!`
` So if you let me cry just a little longer, ......I'll be fine..."`
`"That isn't true...`
` ......I can understand how much it must be hurting your heart to have lost both parents...`
` ...I still have my mother.`
` ...I've got it much better than you, Battler‐kun..."`
`"No, you haven't!!`
` You have it the worst, George‐aniki...`
` ......I understand, Aniki..."`
`"...Out of all of us, ...you're the most devastated, and the most in pain!!`
` I know that...`
`so I can't keep on snivelling like this...!!`
` Uuu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}uughhu{0}uugh!!"`
`"......Why......do you say that......?"`
`"To me, Dad and Kyrie‐san......were people I'd eventually part with when I became an independent adult.`
` Since they're parents, it's fated that they'd die before their children.`
` ...It's just that it happened a little early...!"`
`".........But it's not like that for you, Aniki.`
` You didn't just lose a parent you'd part with eventually.`
` .........You also lost someone you should have lived your whole life with,`
` ............you lost Shannon‐chan as well...!!"`
`"......................................."`
`"It's not like human lives have different weights.`
` Whether it's a baby or an old person, they're all just as precious...!"`
`"......But still, the longer the life they had in front of them,`
` ...the longer the future you'd have built together, ............the sadder their death is......!!"`
`"Aniki, you were engaged to Shannon‐chan, weren't you?`
` You promised that you'd build a life and a home together in the future, didn't you?!`
` .........Compared to how huge that future was, ...compared to how huge that happiness was,`
` ......my pain doesn't even come close...!!"`
`".........No one would blame you for crying so, so much more...!!`
` And yet, ...just because you're like a big brother to us cousins,`
` .........you force yourself to act like everything's all OK......!!"`
`"..................Stop it, ...Battler‐kun."`
`George was trying to make a calm smile.`
`......But.........he couldn't, any longer, stop a single hot tear from leaving a streak down his face.`
`"......How could I possibly...`
`......not be sad...?`
` .........I think of Shannon, and all the futures we imagined together.`
` We talked of so many dreams, the hundred years of our human lives would never have been enough to make them all come true."`
`"......Of those dreams,`
` not even the very first one,`
` ............having her move into my family register... We couldn't even have that...`
`......so how could I possibly...`
`.........not be sad.........?"`
`"Compared to that, I, ......I...!!`
` Like I said, I have no right to cry any more!`
` When even you're holding back, Aniki, what right do I have to shed any more tears?!"`
`"......We're the same.`
` ...Both of us feel the exact same sadness from losing the ones we love.`
` .........So there's nothing saying you don't have the right to cry compared to me."`
`".........And...`
`...there's nothing saying...I have to hold back {i:my} tears...any longer either."`
`"...Aniki, ......Anikii...!!!`
` UOO{0}Oo{0}o{0}ooHhh{0}hhO{0}OoOhh{0}hgghhh!!"`
`"Shannon and I always talked about our future together...and now she's dead.`
` And my dad, he's dead too.`
` .........It hurts, ......it really hurts...`
` ......uuu{0}uuhuu{0}huu{0}huu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}uugh{0}hh{0}uuughh!!"`
`As Battler and George tightly hugged each other, they cried a waterfall of tears over each other's shoulders for those people important to them...`
`"............Do you understand why I said that George‐aniki is the most in pain...?"`
`"I, ......I was listening, so I understand.`
` ......The sadness is proportional to the length of time that would have been spent together in their lives after that..."`
`"......Of course, you can't calculate it just like that though.`
` .........We {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s aren't like you witches.`
` ......We have a finite time we're alive to the moment we die, and we live it with our utmost strength."`
`".........I can't forgive anyone who makes light of that.`
` ......Never mind someone who sneers at it and toys with it.`
` ...A person like you, whose very concept of death is all screwed up, probably can't understand that."`
`"......................................."`
`"......It isn't just the length of time we'd live afterwards.`
` ......Sneering at the lives of people living with all their strength...`
` That's...what I can't forgive the most."`
`"George‐aniki has gone through his life hell‐bent on doing his best.`
` ...He must have shown up today with heroic determination in order that he could marry Shannon‐chan.`
` ......It's completely different from me, a guy who was just feeling happy to be able to meet his cousins again for the first time in ages."`
`"...B‐.........But still—"`
`"Beato.`
` For now, stay silent and listen."`
`"............M‐...mm."`
`".........In a way, I do understand where you're coming from.`
` ...You say that you need to continue murdering according to that weird epitaph for your own resurrection."`
`"......So if I keep the circumstances of your position in mind,`
` ......I can just barely understand your murders.`
` ......Because for you, that is a necessary action.`
` ......In that case, all further unnecessary actions are your own meaningless cruel hobby."`
`"......In other words, if killing six people for the first twilight is a "necessary action" for you,`
` ...all that show of crushing their faces and splitting their stomachs and stuffing them full of sweets is your own, completely unnecessary,`
` preference for cruelty.`
` .........I absolutely cannot forgive this aspect of you."`
`"........................m...mm......"`
`"When Auntie Rosa was repeatedly killed in horrible ways,`
` ......you said, "she'll be brought back to life in the end, so it doesn't matter how she kills her",`
` ...or something like that, I hear.`
` {f:5:Virgilia} told me."`
`".........That was...`
`...well...`
`umm........."`
`"That idea that you can kill them as many times as you want, as long as you bring them back to life in the end,`
` is a completely unnecessary action of toying with a life, isn't it?"`
`".........If you're going to kill them, get it over with!`
` Don't toy with them!!`
` If you aren't going to kill them, then don't tease them!!`
` You're taking advantage of the fact that you can do as you will with people's lives, and you've forgotten the sanctity of life.`
` So I can't accept you...!"`
`"I definitely can't accept as my opponent a person who doesn't know the weight of a life, and the sadness when that life is lost!"`
`"...............That is why the Endless Magic is known as a black art.`
` ...An Endless Witch has no concept of the finite.`
` ......They have no concept of the finite, of the end that is implied by breaking and killing."`
`"...For that reason, Endless Witches sometimes treat the gap between life and death as if it was a Chinese jump rope,`
` and start jumping back and forth over it."`
`".........That is a very, very frightening thing.`
` That is why, as an Endless Witch, and out of my own desire,`
` {i:I never reached your level}."`
`{f:5:Virgilia} had told Beato that countless times before.`
`But Beato had been too young to obediently listen to those words.`
` She had been too wild.`
` ...She had been possessed by that...detestable pleasure.`
`"......I had always been told not to break vases.`
` ......But that's what made me want to break them someday."`
`".........Then, when I gained the Endless Magic,`
` ...and I learned that I could fix it back to normal no matter how much I broke it,`
` ......I was surprised at how fun it was to break a vase..."`
`"That is called the forbidden honey.`
` People are not captivated by what's inside.`
` They are captivated by the lock that seals it.`
` .........It truly is deplorable."`
`".........I want to ask you, {f:5:Virgilia}.`
` Why does this thing called the Endless Magic exist?`
` ...For what purpose does it exist in this world?"`
`"It is not limited to the Endless Magic.`
` ...All magic exists to bring happiness to the human world."`
`"......After everything that has happened, it may be difficult for you to believe, Battler‐kun, ......but we witches train in order to bring blessings to the human world,`
` to become a bridge between humans and those who are not human."`
`"......How the hell does reviving the dead and torturing them to death over and over again help the human world?"`
`"When a vase that is an important memento is broken,`
` if by fixing it everyone will regain their smiles, I would repair it with magic as many times as necessary.`
` However, I would not be fixing it in order to break it again.`
` ......I would be reviving it to give humans happiness."`
`"In that case,`
` ............Beato.`
` You fail as an Endless Witch."`
`"..............................h......mmm..."`
`"......There's something that's just come to me.`
` .........Why do I keep going on with this strange game against you?"`
`"......Maybe this isn't a game to make me submit.`
` ......Couldn't it be a test for you to be accepted as an Endless Witch, {i:in its true meaning}?"`
`"...I, .........I don't know about that.`
` ...The reason I proposed this game to you was, umm, ......simply as a way to kill time...`
` There was no one's ulterior motive."`
`"Just now, I heard the definition of a witch from {f:5:Virgilia}.`
` By that definition, you, Beato,`
` are not even a witch.`
` You'd be an apprentice who's in the middle of her training, and who misunderstands her own power."`
`"......This was supposedly a fight between a witch and a human.`
` In that case, someone like you, who isn't a witch, is not qualified to be my opponent.`
` .........Understand?"`
`"......I am still...`
`.........only an apprentice,`
` ......you say......`
` Then, when will I be accepted as your opponent once again?`
` ......When can we resume this game?"`
`"..................Who knows.`
` ...At the very least, it isn't now.`
` ......When you fully understand what I've said, and become a real witch,`
` ...I will probably accept you as my opponent in this game once more."`
`"I, I can't understand if you say it so abstractly like that...`
` Clearly tell me what I should do to earn your forgiveness..."`
`"No, I've said enough.`
` You think about the rest.`
` .........I've said everything I want to say.`
` ...If you can't understand it, try talking with {f:5:Virgilia} and Ronove.`
` ...A brat like you should start off by listening to what the adults say."`
`".........{f:5:Virgilia}.`
` I will suspend the game for now.`
` Now that Ronove has stepped down as representative,`
` all we can do is wait for Beato to gain the qualifications of a proper opponent."`
`"......Understood.`
` ......Until Beato has been accepted as having gained those qualifications, the game will proceed without an opponent.`
` Is that alright with you too, Beato?"`
`"...I, ......I have no objections.`
` .........I want time, and a place where I can think at a leisurely pace.`
` ...May I take my leave now?"`
`".........Yeah, sure."`
`"...Well then, see you...later."`
`"Wait.`
` ......Don't make that dejected face."`
`"........................Sorry about that.`
` Letting everything inside my heart show up on my face is part of my personality.`
` I cannot deceive."`
`"In that case, there's hope for you yet.`
` .........Let me promise you one thing.`
` In this game with you, I might win, and I might lose.`
` ......It's also possible that it'll be a victory by default for me if you don't come back."`
`At that point, Battler stopped talking for a second.`
`{n}...Then he spoke forcefully.`
`".........However, I definitely won't be the one to step down.`
` I definitely won't give you a victory by default.`
` ......I will keep on waiting here, for you to sit there again as my worthy opponent."`
`"......Battler‐sama..."`
`"...............Thank you,`
` Battler.`
` ...I will definitely come back and be accepted by you."`
`Beato showed him a very slightly hopeful smile, and disappeared.`
`...Looking at that expression, Battler strongly believed that her face could tell no lies...`
`The seven survivors returned to the guesthouse once again.`
`{n}By now, it was clear that those who went outside would not be able to return alive.`
`Rudolf's group had gone out holding two guns and one master key.`
` But those had been lost.`
`It was more than clear by now that they had been stolen by the culprit.`
`Since the windows were closed with the shutters, they wouldn't open even if the culprit had the master key.`
`They sealed the front door and all other doors to the outside with chains,`
` and further blocked them with sofas and tables.`
`Even if the culprit decided to break in through violent means, it wouldn't be easy for them.`
`"......At this point, the typhoon may actually be fortunate.`
` If it were clear outside, it might have been possible for them to set fire to the guesthouse."`
`"If there wasn't a typhoon in the first place, the boat would have arrived before noon.`
` I'm not sure you can call that a cloud's silver lining."`
`"......Eva‐san, how are you feeling physically?`
` Please, try to take it easy."`
`"Thank you.`
` ...I still have a temperature, but now isn't the time to be saying things like that.`
` ......Now is not the time to be stuck in bed, for the children's sake as well."`
`After crying so much in front of Hideyoshi's body,`
` Eva had now gained a strong self‐awareness that she was a mother, and her expression conveyed a strong will.`
`...Actually, her fever still hadn't gone down.`
`And she was aware of that.`
` Whenever she wasn't galvanizing herself, she felt the fever starting to make her mind hazy again.`
`By this point, the first floor was a final line of defense made by Krauss, Natsuhi, and Eva.`
`{n}The children and the guest, Nanjo, had been strongly warned not to carelessly come downstairs.`
`If the culprit used a ladder or something, it probably wouldn't be impossible for them to attack from upstairs.`
`But it wouldn't be easy for them to break those sturdy shutters from such an unstable position.`
` It was comparatively safer upstairs compared to downstairs.`
`Battler and George had hoped to remain downstairs as well, to fight in the worst case scenario, but Eva had rejected that.`
`In her mind, George was now her only family.`
`{n}It seemed that she didn't even want to expose him to the danger of coming downstairs to the first floor.`
`Krauss and Natsuhi could also understand that feeling.`
`......A great deal of time had now passed since they once again barricaded themselves in.`
`In the cousins' room upstairs, Battler, George, and Jessica were sitting dazed,`
` their ears not even registering the TV that had been left on.`
`For a while, Nanjo had been with them, and had tried to send them words to cheer them up,`
` but when he realized that he might actually be having the opposite effect, he disappeared into his own upstairs room.`
`George kept looking dazedly at the photographs inserted in his notebook.`
`......They were from that time he had taken a vacation to Okinawa with Shannon.`
`Shannon's happy smile was contained in those photographs.`
`......George could remember the temperature and the humidity, the warmth and strength of the wind,`
` and even what he had been talking about with her at the time those photos had been taken, as clearly as though it had been yesterday.`
`So to George, they weren't simply photos,`
` but a door to bring back warm memories...`
`In this room, even though the sound of the typhoon and the TV should have entered George's hearing,`
` ......it was the scenery of Okinawa he had seen with her, and her laughing voice, that reached his eyes and his ears...`
`After meeting Shannon, George had made the decision to be reborn.`
`He had sworn to separate himself from the timid person he had once been:`
` easily caught up in the atmosphere, unable to refuse a request, and easily used by those around him.`
`......He had resolved himself to become a strong man who would make her life even more joyous.`
`So.`
` ...If he hadn't met Shannon,`
` ......the man called Ushiromiya George would probably have lived a very different life.`
`And the George of that different life surely wouldn't have been as excellent a man as he now was.`
`The way he was now, he was for the sake of Shannon.`
` ......But if that same Shannon was now gone,`
` ...he found himself wondering why he exists.`
`Isn't it completely meaningless?`
`...A deep, deep sadness, as though he himself had become empty.`
`That feeling had tormented him the whole time.`
` ......However, until Battler had told him, he hadn't been aware of the feeling himself.`
`......He finally remembered...that he should have cried much, much more.`
`So he had cried.`
` Just like Battler, he had cried himself dry.`
`......By now, his eyes were bright red and swollen, and he could not cry any more.`
` So George did his best to change his way of thinking.`
`He decided to think that he was not meaningless, ...that he should be grateful to Shannon for giving him such a character.`
`Dead lives are not revived.`
` He would have to get over being separated from his beloved.`
`If he were to come after Shannon by killing himself, she would surely be deeply dejected.`
`......It would be the same the other way around, too.`
` If he died, and Shannon chased after him, throwing away her own life, he wouldn't be able to forgive himself.`
`......So he chose to surpass his emotions of sadness and anger,`
` .........and decided to thank her.`
`Meeting Shannon had made his days rich and full,`
` ...and had taught him the meaning of working hard for other people's sakes.`
`As a result, she had shaped him into the person he had wanted to be.`
`{n}...He thought he should thank her for that.`
`By doing that, he tried to quell his sadness.`
`{n}But each time he did, he remembered Shannon's smile...`
`.........He knew it, logically.`
`He understood that grieving any more than this would only make her grieve in heaven,`
` ......yet he couldn't stop his sadness...`
`"Why...`
`......does people dying...`
`...make us this sad..."`
`Battler muttered.`
`{n}...It was as though he was speaking on behalf of all humans.`
`He probably hadn't been asking anyone, but Jessica answered.`
`"......Partings are always sad, no matter what they're like."`
`"...But, when, for example, the person is old, or there's some time it's going to happen,`
` ...when it's expected in advance, and you know it's a farewell that must come sooner or later,`
` ...you can spend a long time softening the blow of that sadness.`
` ......Sudden misfortune is probably sad...because you aren't allowed even that..."`
`"...............I see, yeah.`
` ...Sure, if they get sick or something, and end up bedridden in a hospital for several years, you might be able to ready yourself for it bit by bit,`
` ...but when it happens suddenly some day, you don't have that much time."`
`"...The sadness which you should normally spend several years softening closes in on you all at once.`
` .........No wonder it's tough.`
` ......Sometimes, it might even cause a sadness great enough to leave a scar for life..."`
`"......Enough to leave a scar for life, ...you say."`
`"......It's like Grandfather's occult hobby.`
` That was what they whispered about it.`
` ......That maybe {f:5:Beatrice} was his lover, who died a long time ago, and he was so sad that he couldn't pull himself together."`
`"......And that's why he started sacrificing the rest of his life to research of the occult, in order to revive the dead.`
` ......That's what they said."`
`"In that case, Grandfather succeeded in that miracle in his last moments.`
` ......The culprit would be the revived {f:5:Beatrice}, with Grandfather being reunited with her at the moment he was killed.`
` ......Pretty ironic that he revived her, only then to be killed by her."`
`"............Even so, Grandfather was probably able to meet her.`
` ...He gambled half of his life, and even though it was only for a short time,`
` he was probably reunited with the woman he wished to see once again."`
`"...Except he got totally roasted.`
` Probably wanted a bit more than that out of half a life's research."`
`"I wouldn't say that.`
` .........Even if it was only for an instant,`
` ......Grandfather must have been happy to be reunited with the woman he loved."`
`".........Even if his sin of defying life's providence was punished by God,`
` and his body was burnt and sent down to hell,`
` ...and even if the reunion he got in return only lasted a very short time..."`
`"George nii‐san......"`
`"......I wouldn't care if I met with the wrath of God and had my body burned.`
` .........Even if it was just for a short amount of time,`
` ......if I could revive Shannon again,`
` ..................I would sacrifice the rest of my life to the same research as Grandfather."`
`"......Five minutes would be enough,`
` ......I just want to talk with Shannon again...`
` ......Even one minute would be fine......`
` ......In exchange, ...I wouldn't mind......sacrificing the rest of my life......!"`
`".........Aniki......"`
`When Battler and Jessica realized that their pointless discussion was hurting George, they had no choice but to shut their mouths...`
`......George directed his thoughts at Kinzo's life:`
`I saw him sacrifice half of his life to research that no one could understand.`
`......And, on the last day of his life, he revived the person he loved most,`
` ......and probably succeeded in his reunion in his final moments.`
`I don't know how much time they were able to spend together.`
` ...I don't know whether they were given an hour, ...or just five minutes.`
`However, ......in that moment, all of that time he had sacrificed for his research must have been rewarded.`
` ...Even though he spent decades to gain it, that small amount of time must have been enough to reward him.`
`Until today, I never believed in the occult or magic or anything.`
`{n}Somewhere in my heart,`
` ...I even made fun of Grandfather's research as nothing more than an indulgence.`
`However,`
` ......I won't make fun of it anymore.`
`{n}...No, to the contrary, I strongly believe that it does exist.`
`...If that power of belief can become miracles,`
` I'll probably throw away all of my studies up until today,`
` and spend the rest of my life from today onwards studying magic.`
`.........Give me the power of magic.`
`...And...a miracle which lets me meet Shannon again...`
`"....................................`
` ......Haha, ...ha.`
` ...Sorry, you two.`
` I must be going mad.`
` ......If you could revive the dead with magic,`
` ......people would probably be studying it everywhere around the world."`
`"...But things like that don't exist in reality.`
` No one studies it.`
` .........That's because...they know...that the dead can't be brought back with magic."`
`"............Sorry for saying such weird things.`
` It's my fault that the atmosphere here has gotten so strange.`
` ...Sorry for making you worry about me, even though this is hard on everybody."`
`...Even though I did it to divert myself from my sadness, maybe I did say something strange.`
`If I keep talking about something so weird, I'm sure it won't heal their sadness...`
`But, even so, ...that doesn't mean that I can withstand this silence.`
`"......I'll go downstairs, and get another cup of coffee.`
` ......My mother is very particular about how to make a cup of coffee.`
` Does anyone want a refill?"`
`Battler‐kun and Jessica‐chan lightly shook their heads.`
`{n}Without being any more persistent than that, I took my mug and left the room.`
`I did visit Doctor Nanjo's room to ask whether he wanted any more coffee as well,`
` but he too said that he didn't want any more.`
`......It seemed as though my mother's orthodox method of making coffee wasn't universally appreciated.`
`One time, I had Shannon drink some that I brewed by that method,`
` ......but she told me that while it was delicious, it was a little strong,`
` if I remember her words...`
`"............Shannon........."`
`It's no good...`
` ......Even though I left the room to change my mood,`
` ...that image of Shannon's face that's filling my head hasn't faded in the slightest...`
`The fun days I shared with her were becoming more and more vivid,`
` ............and I felt saddened that I was not even allowed to see her dead face.`
`According to our parents, it seems as though she was killed with something like a gun or spear.`
`...I'm sure they were just trying to console me, ......but they had said that her face in death had been very beautiful and peaceful.`
`I wonder if she's...wearing the engagement ring I gave her last night?`
`......If she accepted my engagement, she should have it on the ring finger of her left hand...`
`Last night, our heads were both full of each other, and we weren't composed at all.`
`Shannon had accepted the engagement semi‐boldly,`
` but she might have regretted that as a rash action once she cooled her head.`
` She might have taken the ring off.`
`......I wonder if she has the ring on now.`
`......I at least want to be sure of that much.`
`{n}I want to know...her final feelings......`
`However, ......even if I do check that, ...it's not as if she'll be revived.`
`...............I wonder what will happen to her body.`
`{n}After the autopsy, ......it will probably be immediately cremated.`
`Then, I'll never be able to see her face, ...even her dead face, for all eternity...`
`"..................`
` .........Haha, ...because of the shock of losing Shannon,`
` ......am I going a little crazy...?"`
`I don't want......Shannon's body to be burned.`
`{n}If she's burned, she'll turn to ash, ......and {i:never again will it be possible for her to revive}.`
`They say that cremation is disliked in Western tradition.`
`{n}......Because on the day of resurrection, there would be no body to revive.`
`Because of that, it seems that great criminals in Western history were often cremated after execution as a punishment,`
` and their ashes were sometimes scattered in rivers and such...`
`In other words, to Western people, death is nothing more than a sleep until the resurrection.`
` It is essential that the corpse is left after death.`
`"In other words,`
` ......that's because Western people...`
`...knew of the existence of...`
`...a miracle to revive the dead.`
` .........But that miracle didn't exist in Japan, so we burn them."`
`Now I understand.`
` ...I understand why Grandfather idolized the Western occult.`
`From the beginning, it had all been only for that reason.`
` ...Just to revive the person dear to him, ...Grandfather spent the rest of his remaining life researching the Western occult.`
`.........The situation surrounding us right now was abnormal.`
`Grandfather had revived his beloved {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`...And that {f:5:Beatrice} had carried out a terrible serial murder,`
` with chains of locked rooms that were impossible without the use of magic.`
`......The Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}The incarnation of the miracle of the Western occult.`
`{n}.........And also, the culprit who killed Shannon......`
`I should hate that being, ............and yet, for some reason, I want to cling to the hope she represents.`
`I wonder if she could use that miraculous magic that Grandfather spent his life espousing...to revive Shannon...`
`According to the Ushiromiya family legend, Grandfather met with her long ago, and was given a vast quantity of gold.`
`...Then if I also met her,`
` ......instead of gold, would she give me Shannon's life?`
`In return, she could impose any kind of devil's contract.`
`{n}For that, I would sacrifice all of my remaining life...`
`George probably couldn't have believed or noticed that, ...right behind him,`
` ......the witch herself stood, listening to his voiceless wish.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} had been listening to everything George and the others had to say since their discussion just now in the cousins' room.`
`......Battler had told her that she didn't know the weight of a human's life,`
` ......and wanting to understand that in her own way, she had stealthily visited, and listened to their discussion.`
`"........................`
` ......You say that is your wish...?`
` If I could grant that, would I be accepted as a witch...?"`
`Beato looked at the palms of both of her hands.`
`...She had handed over most of her previously surging magic power when the new witch had succeeded the name of Endless Witch.`
`Of course, even now her magic power still made her worthy of being called a witch,`
` ...but it did not even compare to her previous strength.`
`"......Hmph.`
` Even without the Endless Magic, I am a Great Witch whose name has thundered through a thousand years.`
` Reviving the dead is no trouble at all."`
`Inside her head, she thought about several magical methods for reviving the dead.`
`......Even magic that she could do easily in the past would be difficult with her current magic power.`
`She thought of something, then clicked her tongue, and repeated this several times.`
`In the end, ......she finally thought of a single spell.`
`But that was a spell that she couldn't use by herself.`
`{n}It was a spell that witches with weak power used, that relied on the aid of others.`
`...In the past, Beato had looked down upon that type of magic.`
`Therefore, she frantically tried to think if there wasn't any other possible spell,`
` .........but in the end, she couldn't think of one, and slumped over in self‐derision.`
`And then, ......careful not to surprise him, she softly called out.`
` Softly, to George's heart...`
`".........Ushiromiya George.`
` ...Can you hear my voice...?"`
`"......I can hear.`
` ......Who are you...?`
` Are you really the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}...?`
` ...Or else, are you an illusion created by my sadness...?"`
`".........If it's the former, I want you to hear my wish.`
` ...And if it's the latter, just leave me alone..."`
`Conversations in the world of the mind are a lot like those in a dream.`
`When you dream, haven't you ever had the experience...`
`of casually accepting something that would have been absurd in the real world?`
`......The conversation in this world was like that.`
`So even though a witch appeared and started talking to George, he was not surprised...`
`"Mm.`
` ......I am...the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` .........Normally, you and I would not be able to talk together like this.`
` ...However, you are strongly conscious of me, and wish to have a discussion,`
` ...so both of our channels are able to match like this."`
`"...............The person who killed Shannon...`
`I don't care if it was you, or someone else taking on your name.`
` ......As long as you exist as a real witch."`
`"............I would pay any compensation.`
` ...If you desire my life, you can take it right now.`
` ......Please, I want you to bring Shannon back to life...`
` .........If that's impossible, then at least, I would like just to be allowed to talk to her for a short while......`
` ......Please........."`
`".........I require no compensation.`
` I shall grant that wish."`
`"...Really......?`
` You'll really bring Shannon........."`
`"Mm.`
` ......However, my current magic power is not sufficient to use resurrection magic.`
` ...Therefore, I must rely on your help."`
`".........If there's something I can do, I'll do anything.`
` ...Even if that means taking my heart out right here and now, I will not hesitate..."`
`"...I'm telling you that I don't require something like that.`
` ............I may cast the spell.`
` Then, a gap would open in the door to Hades."`
`"...But as I am now, I do not have the power to bring Shannon's soul up through that gap.`
` .........However, if it were you, who has strong feelings for Shannon,`
` you should be able to change those feelings into magic, and bring her soul out without fail."`
`"......What do you say?`
` Will you help me...?"`
`"...Of course I will.`
` .........If Shannon's life will be revived,`
` ......I am not afraid to lose everything......!"`
`George's fists shook in silence.`
`...Then he slowly regained consciousness.`
`He had been absentmindedly standing near the window in the hall the whole time, his mug still in his hand...`
`And......`
`............the witch from his dream......was still there.`
`"Wh‐......what the... .........I‐it isn't......a dream........."`
`"......Be quiet.`
` I am very fragile now.`
` If any more {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s appear now, I will not be able to preserve this form.`
` ...I shall grant your wish, so stay silent for now.`
` ...Is that alright?"`
`George covered his mouth with both hands, forcefully nodding several times.`
`As he did, he almost dropped the mug he was holding.`
`George frantically juggled it around and caught it.`
`...He was afraid that if it fell to the floor and made a loud sound,`
` the witch's form might disappear like a bubble popping.`
`He softly set the mug on the floor, ...and stared once again at the witch in front of him.`
`.........Her form didn't disappear.`
` It wasn't a dream......`
`"Come, let us go to the parlor where Shannon sleeps.`
` With the power of your feelings, we will bring back her soul."`
`"Y‐you say go, but...how...?`
` My mother and the others are downstairs.`
` There's no way they'd let me go outside.`
` ......And, didn't you just say that you wouldn't be able to preserve your form if another {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} appeared?"`
`"......Come to think of it, that is true.`
` So, Krauss and the rest are downstairs.`
` ...In that case, we definitely cannot go down.`
` ......Well then, we just need to go to the mansion without going downstairs, right?`
` It's simple."`
`Beato laughed, as though she had thought of a pleasant prank.`
`......And with her golden pipe, she lightly tapped a window with its shutter closed.`
`When she did, three gold butterflies appeared from the pipe and opened the lock on the window as though melting it.`
`Then the window opened without a sound.`
`The shutter beyond it was exactly the same.`
`{n}The clasp unset itself, also without making a sound, and it quietly opened.`
`The window opened, exposing the wind and rain outside the mansion.`
` ...Perhaps because of the direction or something related to the construction of the building, the wind did not blow inside.`
`Because of that, for a while,`
` George felt as though this entrance opening to the outside was a dream or illusion, and he couldn't accept it as real.`
`"Come, let us go.`
` Come with me."`
`Beato gently floated upwards.`
` It was a natural action, like that of a diver enjoying an underwater stroll.`
`......It made it easy to believe that if you acted like she did,`
` you too might be able to float in the sky just as though you were swimming in the water.`
`...No, George did believe that.`
`......So without thinking, just as she had done, he also...`
`...gently...`
`...as though swimming in the water...he moved his feet......`
`"......ah, ............aaaaaaahh........."`
`"Hoh.`
` ...Not bad.`
` So you learned how to dance through the sky faster than I could explain it."`
`George was shocked to find himself floating in midair like he was swimming.`
`...Of course, Beato was also shocked that George, who should have been unacquainted with magic, had learned how to do that just by instinct.`
`".........To be able to...`
`...fly in the air,`
` ......swim in the air......"`
`"...You must not think of the logic.`
` Accept it as a natural thing.`
` ......You must not think back upon the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} doctrines, such as those from Newton and Einstein."`
`"Especially when flying high in the sky.`
` ...Inexperienced witches sometimes fall."`
`"...I, ...I accept it as true...`
` I accept it as true......"`
`George repeated those words over and over.`
`{n}......He must not deny magic, no matter what.`
`To deny that would be the same as to throw away what might be...`
`his first and last chance to revive Shannon.`
`However, compared to Beato, who was elegantly drifting like smoke, George's movements were clearly similar to someone underwater.`
`...Therefore, if he didn't make a movement like kicking his feet in water every once in a while, he would be slowly dragged down by the force of gravity.`
`"I shall praise this as being a better performance than the first time I danced in the sky.`
` ......Here we go.`
` Come with me."`
`Beato beckoned to George, and gently flew into the stormy sky.`
`......It was just like a scene from a fairy tale.`
`The scene unfolding before George's eyes felt entirely like an extension of his dream.`
`"......Being able to fly is......incredible, ......but so is the wind and the rain..."`
`"What's this? Are the wind and rain tormenting you...?`
` ......I could teach you magic to block against that,`
` but it may be too early for you, and it may be a misuse of time right now."`
`"........................Yes.`
` ...The magic I need...isn't that."`
`Without losing to the wind and rain, George wore a strong‐willed gaze.`
`"The mansion is coming into sight.`
` ...Hold out just a little longer.`
` If you fall now, you'll hit the bushes in the rose garden."`
`The undulating rose garden was spread beneath the witch and George's gazes.`
`This fantasy‐like scene no longer surprised George.`
`Only the gradually approaching mansion was reflected in his eyes.`
`"Shannon, .........wait for me...`
` ......I will definitely...revive you......!"`
`Meanwhile...`
`......the cruel new witch could be seen staring at the guesthouse from a different location.`
`"...............Now, all that's left is the seventh and eighth twilights.`
` Just two more, and my obligation to that predecessor hag is finished.`
` .........I'll kill Krauss and Natsuhi.`
` Together like a happy couple."`
`"Nihi.`
` How are the targets nyeh?"`
`"......In the lobby on the first floor of the guesthouse, both targets and Ushiromiya Eva acquired.`
` Measuring anti‐magic power.`
` Data link to 410."`
`"410, data received.`
` Anti‐magic power is extremely low.`
` If Eva just goes outside, they're tuna and abalone on a chopping board.`
` Nihihihihi...!"`
`"What would you ask of us, Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` If you give the order, we will snipe right away...!`
` Please, your orders...!"`
`"...You guys reaally are convenient furniture.`
` Very different from old, second‐hand furniture, which only has enough talent to gouge corpses.`
` Right?"`
`"..............................kh..."`
`"Chiester Sisters, please show me your skill again.`
` ...Prepare to attack!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!`
` Carry the corpses out again, alright?`
` 'Cause I'll play with them a lot.`
` No complaints, OK, Ronove?"`
`"......Yes.`
` Certainly."`
`"Nn......"`
`At that time, the witch noticed something.`
` ......As though some presence had disappeared...`
` ...Was it her imagination......?`
`".........Did you feel some kind of presence just now?`
` Did any of you feel it?"`
`"M‐...my apologies, I didn't notice anything... Please forgive me......!!"`
`"We were in the middle of observing the guesthouse, so our peripheral surveillance was turned off. Nihi.`
` ...What about you, Lucifer‐chaaan?`
` Did you feel a presence?"`
`".........nh—"`
`For just an instant, Lucifer sent a glance at Ronove, questioning whether she should answer honestly or not.`
`Ronove gave a small nod in response.`
`"No.`
` ...My apologies, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` Nothing from us.`
` .........Forgive us for this stupidity, as we are only second‐hand furniture."`
`"..........................."`
`"..........................."`
`"...........................`
` ......I see.`
` If a Great Demon like you says that, then it must have been my imagination."`
`The witch stared persistently in the direction the presence had disappeared to.`
`......That was the direction of the rose garden.`
` And beyond that, she could see the mansion's dark silhouette created by lightning.`
`......It took her quite some time before she pushed her unsatisfied feelings aside,`
` and once again turned to face the guesthouse.`
