`"..............................zzzzz..."`
`"..................Whew.`
` ...Looks like she's finally calmed down..."`
`Hideyoshi wiped his own forehead.`
` ...For a time, Eva had seemed to be having a very painful nightmare, but it appeared that she had finally fallen asleep.`
`As promised, he still gripped Eva's hand.`
` ...He thought it would probably be alright to let go about now, but he faithfully continued to hold her hand.`
`Every once in a while, his hand would get tired, and he would switch between his right and his left,`
` but even so, as promised, he never let go of her hand...`
`At that time, there was a heavy knock.`
` Eva had finally managed to fall asleep, so Hideyoshi grimaced for just an instant.`
`"......Aneki, Hideyoshi‐san, sorry.`
` Is Rosa there...?"`
`It was Rudolf's voice.`
` ...What could it be?`
`Hideyoshi headed for the door, hiding his footsteps so that he wouldn't wake Eva.`
`......It was definitely Rudolf's voice, but just in case, he opened the door without removing the chain.`
`"What is it?`
` Somethin' happen to Rosa?"`
`"We can't find Rosa or Maria‐chan.`
` I thought they might be with you."`
`"...I heard her scoldin' Maria‐chan in the corridor.`
` They got quiet after that, so I thought they went back to the lobby......didn't they...?"`
`"............That idiot..."`
`Rudolf clicked his tongue.`
`Other people could be seen in the corridor.`
` It had been some time since Rosa went out into the corridor, and she had still not returned, so they had begun to worry.`
`Near the front door, Natsuhi pointed at the removed chain.`
`"......The chain isn't set.`
` They must have gone outside to see the rose after all."`
`"Going out and leaving the door unlocked, that is simply too careless.`
` What a troublesome person."`
`"...More importantly for now, I'm worried about Rosa‐san and Maria‐chan themselves."`
`"Right.`
` ......Hey, brats.`
` Where was this rose of Maria‐chan's?!"`
`"I'm pretty sure...it was in the flower bed right in the middle of the rose garden..."`
`"If those two are there, we should be able to tell quickly if we go."`
`"......Dad, I think we should bring them back as soon as we can..."`
`"Of course.`
` We'll bring them both back and spank them on the butt.`
` I'll dash out there and come back.`
` Lock the door as soon as I go out."`
`"...Dad, I'll go with you."`
`"Don't be an idiot.`
` You're a brat, and what brats do is they watch the house with Mommy."`
`"............What is it...?`
` Did something happen......?"`
`"Sorry, did I wake you up...?`
` ...Seems like Rosa‐san took Maria‐chan outside.`
` ...How reckless of her."`
`"Rosa and Maria‐chan went...`
`...outside...?`
` Into the rose garden......?!"`
`"That's right.`
` ...Oh, I guess you must've heard.`
` Maria‐chan was causin' a ruckus 'cause she wanted to see her rose."`
`"......Th‐......they mustn't,`
` ......they mustn't go to the rose garden...!`
` Tell Rosa to stop...!"`
`"Th‐there's no tellin' her to stop now, it looks like they left a while ago.`
` ......Seriously, how reckless of them."`
`".........That's not it...`
` ...Not the rose garden...`
` ...There's a witch there...`
`......and she's waiting for a sacrifice...!`
` Rosa, you mustn't go...`
`......ooooooooooohhh..."`
`...Eva curled herself up again, holding her head.`
`{n}......Her complexion looked very bad.`
`"What is it?`
` Did the fever make you dream somethin' bad?"`
`"............It was a dream,`
` ......yes...`
` ............In the rose garden, the witch, doing that to Rosa and Maria......`
` .........That's right.`
` ...It's a dream,`
` ......yes..."`
`"Calm down.`
` I'm also in this room.`
` The chain is set, too.`
` The shutter's closed on the window, and there's even a gun.`
` This room is just like a fort.`
` There's not a thiiing to be afraid of."`
`Hideyoshi beat his chest, trying to calm her, but Eva's insecure expression didn't change.`
`...Under the covers, Eva kept praying...`
`that the grotesque nightmare she had just had was only a dream...`
`"In the center of the rose garden, Rudolf confirmed the bodies of Rosa and Maria.`
` After that, he returned to the guesthouse, called for help, and carried both of them into the guesthouse."`
`"If we can trust Nanjo's examination, the cause of Rosa's death was a stab to the medulla oblongata with the pointed gate of the fence.`
` It is thought that Maria's death was due to strangling with bare hands.`
` However, due to the "Devil's Proof", we cannot discount a misdiagnosis."`
`"......I will say it in red.`
` {p:1:Rosa and Maria died}.`
` {p:1:The causes of death were as Nanjo diagnosed}.`
` ......She wasn't eaten by a spider, nor was she crushed by a mountain of cake.`
` Don't worry."`
`"............So you argue that even though you toyed with their death so much, it's all okay because the corpse is clean...`
` I definitely won't forgive you.`
` ...All of that brutal treatment you gave Auntie Rosa,`
` I'll never forget it, and I'll never forgive you for it..."`
`"...L‐like I said, that wasn't me......`
` ...I think I gave them a much more peaceful death than the way she treated them..."`
`"Shut the hell up.`
` I don't want to listen to you.`
` .........I've been told that there are no more than 18 people on this island, and now that eight people are already dead,`
` the suspects are narrowed down to ten.`
` One of them probably killed those two."`
`"...Or it could also be an accidental death.`
` Like Maria was having a tantrum,`
` and when Auntie Rosa tried to stop her crying, she misjudged how much power she was using and accidentally killed her.`
` Then, in her consternation, she slipped and fell, landed on the fence, and unluckily, died."`
`"......How's that?`
` That way there's no need for a witch or magic."`
`"......Well, that's not true.`
` Actually, Rosa and Maria—"`
`"Shut up.`
` Didn't I say that I didn't want to listen to you?`
` You're an eyesore, so get lost.`
` You monster."`
`Battler said that without rage, ...but with a horribly cold voice.`
`...Beato had also felt something out of place since the beginning.`
`{n}In a fight, both of them could go at each other without restraint.`
`However, he wouldn't even step into the ring.`
`{n}She could feel that coldness.`
`Beato wasn't pleased about that.`
`{n}...She thought about flaring up, but she held back.`
`Maybe even though she was innocent and childish,`
` she had enough sense to realize that she shouldn't fight.`
`"........................`
` ..................Is that so?`
` Then I will hide myself.`
` ...Ronove, continue for me."`
`"Certainly.`
` ...Will that be satisfactory, Battler‐sama?"`
`".........There are no problems with that proposal.`
` If Battler‐kun says that he doesn't want to see Beato's face, I believe that will be an acceptable alternative."`
`"Do what you like.`
` ...I couldn't care less what you do as long as I don't have to look at that monster's face."`
`"......Hey, wait a second.`
` ...You keep saying "monster monster", but isn't that a mean way to speak of me?"`
`"......Why do you instinctively hate me so much, Battler?`
` None of that was me, it was all the work of my disciple..."`
`".........It's not like I'm only mad about what happened just now.`
` It's from the very beginning."`
`"Come on, Battleer.`
` Don't misunderstand, alright...?`
` Aren't we just a pair of players confronting each other through a game?`
` ...We look for moves to make things painful for each other, but—"`
`"Don't get the wrong idea.`
` I don't hate you because you're my rival in this strange game about whether I accept you as a witch or not.`
` ......I just cannot in any way forgive how senselessly cruel you are."`
`"That's because a serial murder is part of the game...`
` It's probably impossible to avoid a little cruelty..."`
`"I'm not just talking about what just happened.`
` The last time, and the time before that too.`
` ......Tearing everyone's stomach and stuffing it with sweets, plowing their face.`
` What was the point of all that?"`
`"..................That's...`
`well—"`
`"All this stuff about locked‐room murders and tricks and alibis,`
` I'm willing to give you a pass on all that.`
` You want to claim that these are murders done by magic,`
` so I'll grudgingly accept that those complicated crimes have to occur."`
`"......But what exactly are all those grotesque murders supposed to mean?"`
`"............Well, umm,`
` ...............nothing much..."`
`"That's right.`
` They don't mean anything.`
` You're just fooling around by mangling the corpses for fun.`
` That has nothing to do with whether you're a witch, or whether it could or couldn't be done with magic."`
`"You're just exploring the depths of cruelty for fun.`
` I don't hate you because you're a witch, or anything like that.`
` There's just some things I cannot forgive as a human."`
`".........Wh‐`
`......what do you mean, as a human...?"`
`"For example,`
` ......the six people of the first twilight for this game.`
` ...Well, other than Grandfather being burned black,`
` the other five corpses were killed in a normal way, without any unnecessary shaming of the dead."`
`"...It wasn't clear whether the weapon was a spear or a gun, but anyways, as far as killing goes, that was permissibly better.`
` It was much better than the insanity and cruelty of the first twilight last time, or the time before that."`
`"And this time, there were six locked rooms tied together to make a locked‐room chain.`
` ......That was sort of interesting.`
` When we were going back and forth with each other on that, to be perfectly honest, I thought it was just a little fun."`
`"...You were frantic to make me accept your existence, and I was frantic trying to deny it.`
` ......We were both frantically doing all we could."`
`"This may sound weird, but I even felt a faint sense of sportsmanship between the two of us.`
` ...We exist in conflict,`
` but I faintly thought that we {i:might} not be {i:completely} unable to understand each other's existence."`
`".........But just now, that feeling was blown away without a trace."`
`"Th‐that's where you're misunderstanding...!`
` That wasn't me—"`
`"That's not it.`
` That's not what I'm talking about!`
` ......You watched Auntie Rosa being killed horribly over and over,`
` and you sneered at it like it was an interesting show."`
`.........When I saw that, I was deeply disappointed.`
`When I realized that your decision to kill them in a slightly better way this time had been nothing more than a little whim,`
` ...and that nothing had changed in your cruel character, I was deeply disappointed.`
`And that's not all, you were even genuinely enjoying a brutal death.`
`You weren't just acting as cruel as you could to bully me.`
`...You truly, genuinely enjoy cruelty.`
`Your character lets you enjoy it.`
`You saw Auntie Rosa being brutally killed over and over, and said, isn't this fun?`
`That wasn't sarcasm, you enjoyed it from the bottom of your heart,`
` wanted to share that feeling with me, and said, isn't this fun?`
`......In that instant, I despaired, and I realized the truth.`
`"The problem isn't whether you're a witch or not.`
` ......That cruelty of yours is unforgivable to me.`
` And I can't understand it!`
` I can't forgive it, either!`
` Still, I'll continue this game of whether to accept or deny witches.`
` I won't step down and accept my own defeat."`
`"However, your pointless cruelty is absolutely not needed for that game.`
` So I've decided that I won't accept you as my opponent.`
` Ronove is a hundred times better.`
` He doesn't have the same cruel hobby you do.`
` Even if he does, he doesn't have the awful taste to show it off in front of me."`
`"......That's right, you have awful taste.`
` You're heartless and cruel, so you can't understand.`
` That's unpleasant in an opponent.`
` So I don't want to see your face again."`
`After Battler had finished his rant, Beato was shocked into silence for a long time.`
`Maybe she couldn't understand what she was being told,`
` or maybe this was a sign that she was doing all she could in an effort to understand.`
`For a while, she kept switching between angry expressions, frustrated expressions, bold expressions,`
` ......as though she didn't even know herself what attitude she should take.`
`In the end, she made her face into a candid expression, as though she had come to her senses,`
` and shrugged her shoulders as though she was tired.`
`"........................`
` .........In that case, do as you like.`
` From now on, I will continue this game through Ronove.`
` ......You have no complaints as long as I don't show myself, right?"`
`"......For the time being.`
` But I definitely won't forgive your countless cruel actions up until now.`
` So I definitely won't accept you.`
` For that reason as well, I won't back down from this fight you've picked.`
` And I definitely won't lose.`
` ...That's all there is to it."`
`"...............Beato.`
` No matter how many more excuses you give, his impression of you will not waver.`
` ...I have something to talk about later.`
` Until then, stay back."`
`".....................M‐...mm...`
` ...Alright.`
` ...Then I'll hide myself until I'm called..."`
`Looking lonely, Beato turned her back to them, and hid herself.`
`...Battler watched, a slightly displeased expression on his face.`
`He thought his argument had been valid, but for some reason, his mood didn't clear up.`
`"......She's...`
`an idiot."`
`".........That's true.`
` An idiot, and honest."`
`"That idiot watched with me as Auntie Rosa was horribly killed,`
` and turned around with a huge smile on her face."`
`"......She really believed that she could laugh with me at that cruel show.`
` ...She really believed that I could sympathize with that emotion..."`
`"Looking at that innocent smile, I felt just horrible.`
` ......It would have been much better if she'd said it with her normal bullying face...`
` ...Damn it..."`
`"Milady has never had the experience of having a friend.`
` ......In addition, she has probably never had something spoken to her that strongly."`
`"Both Madam and I are her attendants.`
` No matter what we say, it will not reach her ears.`
` For Milady, this is also—"`
`"To hell with that.`
` I don't remember ever becoming her friend."`
`"......That is true.`
` My apologies."`
`".....................`
` ......There is one thing I would like to thank you for.`
` ...Thank you for not backing down from that child's game."`
`She spoke words of gratitude, but for some reason, Battler made a displeased face.`
`Then, as though finding revulsion in his own bad mood, he chuckled.`
`"Now that I've even got witches and demons thanking me, I'm screwed.`
` ......Let's resume the game.`
` Of course, I don't intend to go easy on you."`
`"I wouldn't have it any other way.`
` Unlike Milady, I do not get agitated."`
`"......I've already made my move.`
` If we suppose that Auntie Rosa is the culprit and died in an accident, I can deny the witch.`
` ......I don't want to suspect Auntie Rosa, but for now I'll deliberately assume that it was her, just to beat the hell out of Beato."`
`"I will deny it with red.`
` {p:1:Rosa's and Maria's deaths were homicides}."`
`"Alright.`
` ...Why don't we start from there.`
` ...............Damn, I'm just not getting fired up."`
`Since Rosa and Maria had been killed, it had become clear that the murderer was still hiding somewhere,`
` trying to add even more murders to this chain.`
`As he shed tears, Rudolf scolded Rosa's body over and over for being reckless,`
` but Rosa would never respond to that again.`
`They decided to place the two bodies in one of the guest rooms, and to seal it until the police arrived...`
`The second murder, ...no, the murder of the second twilight, had delivered a heavy blow to everyone.`
`Because it had blown away the optimism that some of them had held—`
`the thought that "actually, a crime didn't occur, and it was all a game or a farce by Kinzo and the servants".`
`Trying to distract themselves from the sadness of losing the people they loved,`
` George and Jessica had spent the whole time since morning talking about every possibility.`
`......And, they had distracted their hearts...`
`...by supposing that these murders might actually have all been an act,`
` and that Shannon and Kanon were only pretending to be dead.`
`When the murders occurred again, it destroyed that thought,`
` ......and they were once again confronted with the fact that their loved ones had most definitely been killed...`
`The tears that they'd thought had died away began to drip down once more, and Battler couldn't think of anything to say to them...`
`After that, to be extra cautious, all of the adults checked that all of the rooms were safe, and that everything was locked.`
`They made certain that the shutters on all of the windows were down and locked, and they checked that no one suspicious was hiding anywhere.`
`On top of that, they checked their weapons once again,`
` and made sure that each other's hearts were prepared, so that they wouldn't hesitate to fire off a preemptive shot if they saw the shadow of a mysterious person.`
`Furthermore, the gun Rosa had been holding had been left near the place she had been found.`
`Someone had gone out of their way to leave it there, so everyone suspected that it was some kind of trap,`
` but when Hideyoshi made ingenious use of a fire iron to fire off a test shot, it discharged without a problem.`
`When all five shots that had been loaded discharged without any problems as a result,`
` it was reloaded with bullets and handed over to the only adult male who wasn't armed, Hideyoshi.`
`However, the fact that it had been able to fire off five shots gave rise to a certain paranoia.`
`This short barrel rifle could load a maximum of five shots.`
`{n}In other words, Rosa hadn't fired even once.`
`And yet, the two had probably been killed by someone with their bare hands.`
`This meant there was a possibility that the crime had been committed by someone whose face they knew...`
`"......When the first murder occurred,`
` I privately thought of the possibility that it was all an act."`
`"...My apologies to Doctor Nanjo, but if he had actually been in on it,`
` and only convinced us that the servants were dead,`
` I thought this could have been some massive, elaborate act by Father."`
`"......After all, unless we assume they were acting, that locked‐room situation of theirs couldn't have been created in the first place."`
`"...We also...`
`...suspected that.`
` ...No,`
` ...I still want to believe that's the case."`
`"...............My apologies, ......but that is not so.`
` ...I am quite old.`
` There may be a chance that I made a misdiagnosis.`
` ......However, I would never mistake whether they were alive or dead..."`
`"I get it!`
` Don't frickin' say it out loud, Doctor Nanjo...!"`
`"......My apologies..."`
`They couldn't know about it,`
` but Beato had already proclaimed the deaths of the six,`
` ...no, this time the deaths of all victims so far, in red.`
`That faint dream that it was all a farce, and that the victims were actually alive,`
` ......was, sadly, impossible...`
`"......In that case, it's more natural to think there's someone hiding on this island who knows the mansion inside out,`
` carrying out a crime they've been planning for ages.`
` In other words, from the time that the typhoon came to this island and sealed it off from the outside world, there were more than 18 people on this island."`
`And, of course, they had no way of knowing this either:`
`That claim of Rudolf's had also been denied in red.`
`{n}There are no more than 18 humans on this island...`
`"Maybe it makes some sense if we think of it this way.`
` ......Essentially, there's the possibility that the person who's hiding is someone who wasn't originally supposed to be on the island right now,`
` yet is someone whose face was known by Rosa‐san, and with whom she would let her guard down."`
`"......S‐`
`so, for example,`
` could it be...a servant whose shift doesn't lie on these two days...?"`
`"Hmm......`
` ...It's hard to argue with that one.`
` After they finish their duties, it is not as though we verify that they leave the island by punching a ticket or something.`
` If we suppose that a servant on a shift from a few days ago only pretended to leave the island, and actually stayed here,`
` that would be hard to deny..."`
`"......Rosa‐san isn't stupid, if you ask me.`
` If a servant who's not supposed to be here popped up in front of you, that'd normally set alarm bells ringing..."`
`"...............I have a problem with assuming this was a crime by an acquaintance.`
` ...Perhaps whoever it was suddenly attacked Rosa from the darkness, and were about to steal her gun.`
` Then Rosa fell, hit her head against the fence, and stopped moving.`
` The guesthouse was nearby, so they wanted to avoid the sound of a gunshot, and they killed Maria‐chan with their bare hands..."`
`"......That's also a possibility.`
` ...Still, even if that is the case..."`
`"Would they intentionally leave Rosa's gun at the scene of the crime?`
` I don't know what the culprit is armed with, but our guns should be a point of worry for them.`
` ...Wasn't that a perfect chance for them to thin out our supply?`
` Why'd they deliberately leave it at the scene of the crime?"`
`"At first, I thought that the gun was a trap.`
` ......That's what chessboard thinking says it would be.`
` By purposefully leaving it, they wanted to make one of us touch it.`
` And they must have wanted to make us pull the trigger.`
` ...I was sure that it would have some dangerous device to make it explode and cause massive injuries."`
`"But, it's actually alright.`
` ......I'd say, the culprit was probably in a hurry.`
` I'll bet that right now, they're regretting they missed their chance to steal a gun...!"`
`".........I don't like it.`
` It pisses me off, 'cause it's like a message from the witch, saying she isn't even scared of guns."`
`"...However, in any event, this is a fearsome opponent.`
` It should have been obvious to any observer that Rosa‐san was holding a gun.`
` To think that they attacked her despite that.`
` ......We should not neglect the fact that they are unafraid of guns."`
`"Mm...`
` It is as Natsuhi says.`
` ......We should probably be even more cautious than we have been."`
`"This is just for peace of mind, but...`
`.........at the time we think Rosa‐san went outside,`
` where was everyone...?"`
`"Natsuhi and I were here, along with Rudolf and Kyrie‐san.`
` I can guarantee their alibis."`
`"Eva and I were together.`
` I can guarantee that."`
`"Me, George‐aniki, and Jessica were together too.`
` ......When Auntie Rosa yelled at us to go back upstairs,`
` we turned right around and went back to the cousins' room with our tails between our legs."`
`"......Back then,`
` ...if we hadn't let Maria go..."`
`"Saying that isn't going to change anything..."`
`"............Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"I, I was reading a book in one of the upstairs rooms.`
` ......I was by myself, so no one can verify my alibi,`
` but I believe everyone saw me return upstairs with the children."`
`"...You could say any number of things like this,`
` but what if you jumped out the window, attacked Rosa,`
` then climbed back up using the rain gutter or something...?"`
`"D‐d‐don't be absurd...`
` How could I perform a feat like jumping down from the second story with this old body...or climbing up, for that matter..."`
`"......Let us stop this...`
` Suspecting each other...`
` It's more important that we trust each other, and, for the children's sakes as well, defend this place until the very end."`
`"Yeah...`
` ...It's like Natsuhi‐san says.`
` .........For now, let's stop doubting each other."`
`"You're right.`
` ...We may be useless as far as searching for the culprit is concerned.`
` ......We can only stay alive until tomorrow, inform the police, and follow their instructions.`
` Because the police will definitely expose who the culprit is."`
`".........What is it, Eva?`
` ...Is your body still feelin' bad...?"`
`"M‐Mother, what's wrong?`
` Are you alright...?"`
`"...Sorry.`
` ...It looks like my fever is still strong.`
` I'll be fine, so leave me alone..."`
`When they looked, they saw Eva staring at the floor, her breathing harsh again.`
`{n}...She had been able to act firm for a time, due to the urgency of their situation,`
` but it seemed her body wasn't at its best after all...`
`"Yes.`
` I killed those two.`
` Now, the only ones who know about the gold are us.`
` I won't give up even a scrap to the other siblings."`
`"............What have you done......!`
` There's so much of that gold!`
` Giving Rosa and the others their share wouldn't have been a problem at all...!"`
`"It would.`
` ...That gold is to be passed on only to the head of the Ushiromiya family.`
` And that makes that gold, all of it, in its entirety, the very honor of the head."`
`"......Putting even the smallest dent in it...`
`is definitely not something I will permit as the new Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"...Do you plan to continue these murders according to the witch's epitaph...?`
` Do you actually plan to kill five more people...?"`
`"Yes.`
` If I don't finish that annoying ritual, it seems that my power as a witch won't become complete.`
` ......Hey, "me"..."`
`"...The power of the witch is really awesome.`
` It really can make all of our fantasies become reality.`
` The power to make dreams more than just dreams...!"`
`"Now that I've learned of this power, I can no longer stop being a witch.`
` If I can complete the ritual and make my power whole, I'm sure I'll be able to teach you that feeling too.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Stop acting like an idiot...!`
` Haven't you played witch enough?`
` We found the gold.`
` And we've even been promised the position of successor to the head.`
` We'll probably need to tightrope walk just a bit, but at this point, that's a dream that will definitely come true.`
` ......Beyond that, what more could you wish for...?!"`
`"I wanted to become a witch."`
`"I don't know anything about that dream...!"`
`"That's it.`
` Because I kept holding on to that dream, I've lived at this age forever.`
` ......You threw that dream away by becoming an adult."`
`"......You thought, no matter how long you waited, the rabbit holding a clock wouldn't visit you,`
` and you wouldn't be able to meet Humpty Dumpty.`
` And of course, you definitely wouldn't be invited to the land of cards.`
` You gave up like that, and so you became an adult."`
`"And that's why you don't want to become a witch or anything like that anymore.`
` ...You've even forgotten that it was the dream of your true self."`
`"......Look, just stop it!`
` I've already gotten my hands on two dreams!`
` The gold and the position of head.`
` That's more than enough!`
` So please, your dream has nothing to do with me!`
` Be obedient...!!"`
`".........No waaaay.`
` Magic's too much fun.`
` .........Besides, those two dreams of yours both came true because of my magic.`
` It's not fair if my dream doesn't come true too."`
`"I am grateful for your magic, and I accept you as a real witch.`
` ......So please, be obedient now and return to the inside of my heart!`
` And never appear again!!"`
`"No waaay.`
` ......We're both misunderstanding each other, aren't we?`
` That's right, I am not you anymore.`
` You are Ushiromiya Eva.`
` I am the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"So I have no responsibility to go back inside your heart.`
` ......I would say I feel like a butterfly who has broken out of her cocoon, namely you."`
`"............haah,`
` ......haah......`
` ...Urg,`
` ......the fever...`
`is making my mind cloudy......"`
`"My inexperience with my magic power is making me support it with your vitality.`
` Until I finish the ritual and become a full witch, you might have to bear the burden.`
` I'll take that in exchange for making two of your dreams come true."`
`"......It's alright, don't worry, okay?`
` For the remaining five sacrifices, I'll avoid your family."`
`"Let's see, Rudolf, Kyrie, Krauss, Natsuhi.`
` ...And what about that old geezer Nanjo?`
` Perfect, I'll kill those five people.`
` *giggle*giggle*, could you call this a murder announcement revealed only to yoouu?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`Eva finally crouched down.`
`{n}Hideyoshi rushed up to her, and lent her his shoulder...`
`"......Are you alright?`
` ...Let's take it easy and rest!"`
`"Are you alright...?`
` Doctor Nanjo, take a look at Eva...!"`
`When Nanjo and George tried to approach, Eva made a gesture to stop them.`
`"...Thank you.`
` I'm fine, Doctor Nanjo.`
` I'm taking medicine.`
` ......I apologize for saying this in such an extreme situation,`
` ...but let me rest a little longer..."`
`"Mom...I'll lend a hand too..."`
`"Thank you,`
` but I'll be fine as long as your father watches over me.`
` ......Go back to the cousins' room upstairs, and don't come out no matter what.`
` ...Understood...?`
` No matter what happens, you must not leave the guesthouse......"`
`"...Outside,`
` ......that...witch is......`
`uuuuhrg..."`
`"Don't talk anymore...!`
` Sorry, everyone, but I'll be watchin' over Eva in the room.`
` Call if somethin' happens."`
`Hideyoshi and Eva retreated from the lobby.`
`...Of course, Eva wasn't the only one who wasn't feeling well.`
` They hadn't gotten a wink of sleep since the previous night, and had been pressed by tension since the morning.`
`...They were mustering their energy to protect their families,`
` but if they relaxed even a little, surely every of one them would be down and out...`
`"......Everything has gone as planned so far, but from here on out, it will become difficult, you see?"`
`"Difficult, you say...?"`
`"Mm.`
` In most cases, as the ritual progresses and the victims increase, they begin to tighten their guard,`
` and often, they hole up in one place and stop moving.`
` That is extremely inconvenient for us."`
`"...Are you saying that we witches are inferior to a bunch of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s in a group...?"`
`"Witches are never inferior to {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s...`
` However, perhaps you could say that times change, and that {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s have gotten their hands on a poison..."`
`"......This wasn't a problem long ago, during the period when witches were believed in,`
` but just like that annoyance Battler, people in the current era generally deny magic."`
`"In other words, their existence itself is anti‐magical.`
` As a result, at some point, they grew to possess a toxin inside their bodies that denies magic."`
`"In other words, you're saying that the more {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s there are,`
` the stronger that anti‐magic toxin gets, and the greater the disadvantage is for us witches?"`
`"......The total value of all their hearts' power to deny magic, in other words their Magic Resistance, becomes the denominator to our Magic.`
` Understand?`
` Is that a bit too difficult for you...?"`
`"You're joking.`
` I understand it truly easily.`
` ...In other words, you're saying that the more people there are that don't believe in magic,`
` and the stronger their will is, the greater the dramatic division in the effect of the magic is.`
` ......I see, if that's the kind of formula it is, I'll have to rethink my method of attack."`
`Fundamentally, magic possesses a vast power.`
`It can even make a rain of fire fall from the heavens, divide a sea, and reviving a lost life isn't impossible either.`
`However, that power is extremely weak against the toxin that rejects it.`
`And that toxin has been piling up in {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s since the time they forgot their respect for all things sacred,`
` ...until finally, this earth was covered with enough toxin that the miracles of magic could not be displayed.`
`Thus, witches from across the world were chased from their dwellings.`
`...They were forced to choose whether to throw away their magic and live as {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, or live in hiding in remote areas where the toxin of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s didn't reach.`
`In that sense, Rokkenjima, with its population of only ten to twenty humans, was extremely favorable for witches.`
`And even more favorable was the existence of the ghost story about the witch who lived in the Rokkenjima forest.`
`...Essentially, the fear that a witch might exist permeates the island to a certain extent,`
` weakening the anti‐magic toxin from the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.`
`A small population, and a margin of possibility to accept a magical being.`
`{n}In other words, minds that were only weakly anti‐magical.`
`...Only in the valley where those two converged...could a witch live in modern times...`
`"I see...`
` ......So by this formula, we can say that there are several rules a witch must follow to use her power efficiently."`
`"The first one is creating a scene.`
` Create a murder scene that you couldn't imagine was done by {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, decorate it with occult ornaments,`
` make it look very much like a witch exists, and by permeating the people with fear, make them believe that witches exist,`
` and as a result, the anti‐magic power and the denominator for the power of the magic will be decreased."`
`"......I see, so this is why the creepy magic circles of the first twilight were created?"`
`"Th‐that's right, exactly...!`
` The gaudy scenes for the first twilight each game are all for that reason.`
` It's definitely not as though I like cruel things or am doing it for fun..."`
`"...In that case, Predecessor‐sama,`
` this time was a failure.`
` You killed them in a very plain way.`
` It doesn't look like anything more than a simple mystery."`
`".........You should have damaged the bodies more grotesquely, like you did last time and the time before that, as I heard from Ronove,`
` making it look like a fantasy and instilling fear in those people."`
`".........W‐...well, about that.`
` ...I thought it wouldn't be artful to do that every time, you understand...?`
` Don't think too deeply on it, it's just a whim...!"`
`Actually, it really had been her whim.`
`{n}After being told all that by Battler, she couldn't say it out loud anymore,`
` but she had decided her method of killing based only on a whim.`
`No, would it be better to say that she had halfheartedly let Ronove decide?`
`{n}Because she had left the locked room of this game's first twilight to him.`
`But if Beato had gotten a cruel idea, then she surely would have explored the limits of atrocity even worse than the last game...`
`"...........................`
` For the methods of Rosa and Maria's deaths too, you told me to show restraint,`
` but that wasn't a course of action beneficial to us witches either, was it?"`
`"In actuality, at the present moment, none of them believe one bit that a witch actually exists.`
` They're sure that it isn't a fantasy, but completely in the mystery genre.`
` This turn of events is a failure for us witches.`
` ......And it's all because, for some reason, you keep doing things in a kinda lukewarm way, Predecessor‐sama."`
`"Aah... L‐like they say, you should seek out work while you're young...!`
` This is a test from me to you as your predecessor.`
` Challenge it with respect.`
` Wahahaha...!"`
`Beato tried to laugh heartily,`
` but it was obviously a fake laugh trying to cover something up,`
` and the new witch shrugged, sighing.`
`"........................`
` ...At this stage, it's probably too late to reduce the anti‐magic power by creating a scene.`
` ...In that case, there's another move.`
` Having the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s split up should work."`
`"Mmhm, that is probably the most effective way.`
` The smaller the number of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, the more the denominator shrinks.`
` As a result, the magic power becomes immediately effective.`
` ...In other words, the crucial point from here on will be how to destroy this barricade situation and have them split up into small groups."`
`"However, they are already very cautious.`
` The barricade won't be destroyed easily, you know...?`
` Both the barricade in Kinzo's study two games ago and the barricade in the parlor last time were very stubborn.`
` Furthermore, most of the cunning adults have been left this time."`
`"The situation is more difficult than all the ones before it, you see?`
` ......If you wish, I could give you some special advice..."`
`If the first murder case occurs in a closed circle, the survivors hole up without fail,`
` gathering together to observe each other and ensure their safety.`
`......Worrying about how to break that situation apart is probably the domain of murderers and mystery authors,`
` so how ludicrous it is that witches, who are meant to exist at the other end of the spectrum, share in that exact same worry.`
`For a while, the new witch poked her cheek with her index finger, making gestures as though deep in thought, and eventually spoke.`
`"...........................`
` ......No, I'm fine.`
` After all, it is a test.`
` ......I won't borrow your moves."`
`"Mh, ...really...?`
` ...The thing is, though, it will be pretty hard to defeat this barricade, you know...?"`
`"I've already made my move.`
` I'm pretty sure it will work.`
` If they're smart, then it definitely will."`
`"I‐is that so......`
` You really are excellent...`
` I am pleased that my disciple isn't hard to deal with."`
`"My motto is to study things myself before asking other people.`
` ......Then, if you would excuse me.`
` I have to wait for my prey to get nonchalantly lured out."`
`"Mm.`
` ...Well then, handle it with care."`
`As the new witch lowered her head, her face blank, she turned into gold butterflies and hid herself.`
`......Beato looked slightly unamused.`
`{n}It seemed she was lonely since she hadn't been relied on at all.`
`"...............Not one of them bothers themselves with me.`
` .........Hmph.`
` You witch apprentice, acting so smart.`
` ...I'll bet any moment now she's going to make some painful mistake and start crying."`
`"Then, without a doubt, she'll finally realize my greatness and follow my teachings!`
` *cackle*, until then, I shall watch from above."`
`She laughed loudly on the outside, but a laugh no one can hear is completely pointless.`
`Beato started to feel empty, and quickly stopped laughing.`
`...Ronove chose that time to show himself.`
`"Excuse me, Milady.`
` ......The game of the second twilight with Battler‐sama has ended."`
`"......Mh, ...I see.`
` Good work.`
` What was the result?"`
`"My sincere apologies.`
` I was forced to resign.`
` ......Battler‐sama's claim of "Rosa strangled Maria to death, then died in an accident",`
` I struck down in red with "both deaths were homicides",`
` ...but I could not repel his chain of moves placing Eva as the principal offender."`
`"But Eva was sleeping in her room the whole time as Hideyoshi cared for her."`
`"...He put forth the possibility that Hideyoshi was an accomplice, and that the two worked together to create an alibi."`
`"He even suspects Hideyoshi...?!`
` Couldn't you have struck back by saying in red that they were in the guest room at the time of the murder?"`
`"......I also thought of that, but, in any event, several important pieces might have been taken several moves later.`
` ...And, because there is a possibility that this move was part of the preparations made by the new {f:5:Beatrice},`
` I acted out of respect to her.`
` ...My apologies."`
`"Preparations, you say.`
` .........Her mind does seem to be sharp.`
` ...Hmm, we can let her do as she likes.`
` It will be quite a show to see how far she can go."`
`"Pukkukukuku.`
` I thought you would say that.`
` ......I see that your disciple's unpleasantness has you in a bad mood."`
`"That's none of your business.`
` I wonder how that one plans on destroying this barricade from here on out.`
` I shall keep a close eye on her."`
`"...............Oh, and...`
`...how was B‐...Battler's mood?"`
`"It appeared as though he had calmed himself down.`
` He did say that, after all, he couldn't get fired up without you as his opponent."`
`"R‐really, that's no surprise, no surprise at all!`
` If I don't return for the fourth twilight and after, Battler will probably be lonely himself...!"`
`"Pu ku ku ku...`
` And with that, if you would excuse me.`
` ...I must bake some delicious cookies.`
` So as to at least enliven the discussion between Milady and Battler‐sama."`
`"Mmhm!`
` That guy really was munching your cookies, wasn't he?`
` It must be because he's a boy that he can eat so much.`
` Make a lot of them...!"`
`"Certainly.`
` I shall make enough cookies to bury the table."`
`"Yes, you do just that!"`
`"......What's going on?`
` What did you want to talk about...?"`
`Kyrie called Rudolf out into the corridor.`
` It was obvious that she wanted to talk about something that she didn't want the others to hear.`
`"Umm, I..."`
`"Yeah?"`
`".........want to go outside."`
