`"Dad.........Mom......!!`
` Who would do something like this...?!!`
` Waaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaahhh...!!"`
`Jessica's woeful voice echoed throughout the rose garden...`
`Perhaps it was the intuition of a person who lived on this island.`
`...After Jessica had looked in the rose garden where Auntie Rosa and Maria had fallen and seen nothing,`
` she had gone to look in the arbor next.`
`Normally, the arbor was probably a wonderful location to enjoy tea peacefully while appreciating the roses on a good sunny day.`
`......Who knows, maybe even Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi...`
`had their days where they relaxed and enjoyed tea together there.`
`......In that arbor lay the bodies of Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi.`
`At least they weren't drenched in the rain like Auntie Rosa and Maria had been,`
` but there was no way I could say that out loud to Jessica at that moment...`
`"......What do you think, Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"Str‐...strangulation, I believe.`
` ...Take a look at this.`
` On their necks, there are distinct markings that something thin was used to strangle them."`
`"Right.`
` ......I doubt that these things were the primary cause of their deaths."`
`...The two stake‐like weapons decorated with an occult design that were lying on the ground...`
`had been found driven into Uncle Krauss's thigh area,`
` and near Aunt Natsuhi's calf.`
`When we had found these sticking out of my parents' forehead and chest,`
` we had decided to leave them exactly as they were for the police and to preserve the crime scene,`
` ......but Jessica no longer cared about such matters, and immediately pulled the stakes out of her parents' forsaken bodies.`
`"......So we've found all five gouged corpses now, in the head, chest, stomach, knee, and leg."`
`"Uuuuhhhghhhhuu, shit, shit shit!!`
` I'll frickin' kill that murderer, kill him!!`
` UwaaAA{0}AAaa{0}aaHHH...!!"`
`"......Everything as far as the eighth twilight is finished now.`
` ...Is this going to continue onto the ninth twilight?`
` ......The witch revives, and none shall be left alive."`
`"Bring it on, dammit...`
` ......When it says the witch revives,`
` ...that means the culprit's gonna make his grand appearance, right?!"`
`"Bull{i:shit} no one's gonna be left alive...`
` ......I'll kill him myself...!`
` I'll make sure I kill whoever murdered Mom and Dad, with my own two hands...!!"`
`Jessica howled furiously, her emotions laid bare.`
` ......To avoid being crushed by her grief, she could do nothing but resist it with anger.`
`".........We still...haven't found George.`
` ...Jessica‐chan, and the rest of you, you can stay here if you want.`
` I'll go to the mansion."`
`"E‐Eva‐san, we mustn't split up...!!`
` It is dangerous if we do not all stick together...!"`
`"There's nothing we can do for Nii‐san or his wife.`
` But George may be still alive somewhere...!`
` I have no time to waste here...!!"`
`As Auntie Eva screamed this, Jessica glared at her.`
`...Auntie Eva had no more time to bother about the dead.`
`{n}She was more concerned for the safety of her only son, who was yet to be seen.`
`"Jessica‐chan, you should stay by your father and mother's side.`
` I'll make a short trip to the mansion.`
` Battler‐kun and Doctor Nanjo, you two can stay here with her as well."`
`After saying this and leaving no time for debate, Auntie Eva rushed out of the arbor.`
`I called out for her to stop, but there was no way she would listen.`
`...However, by now, being alone in this situation meant nothing short of death.`
`If we silently watched her leave, it would be the same as letting her die.`
`{n}As long as Auntie Eva was unwilling to stop, we would have no choice but to follow her.`
`......And, while it may be cruel to say so,`
` Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi were already dead,`
` so there was nothing more we could do for them...`
`In the end, we had no choice but to console Jessica and head for the mansion together.`
`...Fortunately, Jessica stood up.`
`Perhaps she had been able to draw a line under her grief for the moment.`
` ......But, what had surfaced in its place was an expression like a demon.`
`"...I'll murder 'em with my own hands, ......I'll avenge my parents, just you wait.........`
` ......Let's go, Battler.`
` If we find whoever did this, don't get in my way.`
` I'm definitely gonna kill them...!!"`
`".........I also have my parents to avenge.`
` Sorry, but this is first come, first served."`
`"...Yeah, ...that's right...`
` ......Let's make mincemeat of that bastard!"`
`At my words, Jessica finally seemed to feel like someone had sympathized with her emotions.`
`She still had that dark expression, but I felt Jessica regaining some of her sanity.`
`We took off.`
`{n}Chasing after Auntie Eva.`
`Through the rose garden,`
` up the stone steps,`
` running at full speed towards the mansion......whose large, intimidating shadow flashed in the lightning.`
`......With this, the epitaph murders had finished the eighth twilight.`
`{n}And now, on the ninth twilight, the witch will revive.`
`{n}...None shall be left alive.`
`I will most likely lose my life.`
`......But at the very least, I wanted to burn the truth into my eyes.`
`{n}That was the only thing motivating me to move at that moment.`
`We were able to reunite with Auntie Eva, who was having trouble with the lock to the front door.`
`It seemed that all the blood had risen to Auntie Eva's head.`
`{n}That was probably making her fingers clumsy.`
`It seemed she couldn't even handle the simple task of inserting the key into the lock.`
`...Then, there was a faint sound.`
`The sound of the door unlocking.`
` Just as though it had waited for all of the survivors to unite before opening.`
`......It seemed to me as though the malicious mansion...`
`was trying to swallow all of the remaining humans at once...`
`The stench that erupted outwards at the instant the door opened,`
` ...could it really be explained as just a smell?`
`It wasn't just the charred smell from Grandfather.`
`......I think it may also have contained something like...`
`regrets, held by so many dead, including our parents, and all of the servants.`
`...What did it mean as it billowed out, overwhelming us?`
`......Was it the cry of the dead, telling us not to enter?`
`However, Auntie Eva didn't even flinch at something like that.`
`......And we who had to chase after her...`
`were forced to step into the mansion, despite receiving that message...`
`"George?!`
` George!!`
` If you can hear me, answer!`
` Geoooooorge!!"`
`Auntie Eva shouted at the top of her lungs.`
`......Considering the situation, it's probably far too optimistic to imagine that he's alive.`
`When we also started following Auntie Eva's example and calling George‐aniki's name in loud voices...`
`...Auntie Eva found something, and stopped walking.`
`She was standing in front of the door to the parlor.`
`".........What is this.........?`
` D‐Doctor Nanjo, could you come here for a second......?"`
`"Wh‐what is it......?"`
`I had heard from the adults about the creepy magic circles that had been drawn on doors such as the one to the parlor.`
`......Creepy was the only word to describe that thing,`
` which had been scrawled there with a deep‐red paint reminiscent of blood that slowly dripped down.`
`However, that had supposedly been there since this morning.`
`......Wondering why Auntie Eva, who had seen it already,`
` would think it odd now, Jessica and I stared at the door...`
`"......Certainly, .........I have no memory of numbers such as these being written here."`
`"Right, they weren't.`
` ......The creepy magical text was written here, but not the numbers."`
`From what the two of them said, only a magic circle had been there here this morning.`
`However, right now, there were eight digits newly written in the upper part of the magic circle.`
`07151129.`
`...I didn't know what it meant,`
` but I didn't even want to imagine the thought process of whoever wrote this.`
`It was drawn with what was probably the same paint as the magic circle,`
` ...but it had clearly been written very recently.`
`The way it had dried and the condition of the color was completely different from the magic circle part.`
`".........pfeh.`
` I'm sure it just has some magical meaning.`
` It's pointless to rack our brains over it."`
`Jessica intentionally spat those words out in an attempt to wipe out how creepy it was.`
`"It...could be a magic {i:square}.`
` ......The idea that a ward against evil can reside in a certain form of number play.`
` I am sure you have all heard of the one where adding all of the numbers in each row leads to the same sum..."`
`"Wasn't that a group of numbers filled inside a square?`
` This is just a single row.`
` I don't have a clue what it could mean."`
`"......What Jessica‐chan said is probably correct.`
` There isn't any point in us thinking about it deeply..."`
`Even though she said that, she probably suspected that it might actually mean something.`
`Using an old receipt or something from inside her pocket,`
` Auntie Eva deftly wrote that number down with a short ballpoint pen.`
`Because an eight‐digit number would probably be a little difficult to memorize, unless it had some kind of pattern.`
`.................................`
`"......Couldn't...`
`...this be a date,`
` ......or something?"`
`"A date...?`
` What are you talking about...?"`
`"Well, ...it's probably a coincidence,`
` but my birthday...`
`is July 15th.`
` ...Once I thought that 0715 might refer to July 15th,`
` I figured that if 1129 stood for November 29th, maybe that'd fit perfectly..."`
`"............Why would your birthday be written in a place like this?`
` And what's up with November 29th...?"`
`"That's what I wanna know...`
` Still, ...it's probably just a coincidence.`
` When I thought about it, it started to feel a little creepy."`
`"......Is November 29th someone's birthday or something?`
` It's not anyone in my family, not Dad or Kyrie‐san or Ange.`
` And of course, not my mom either."`
`"I cannot think of anything...`
` ...I don't believe it is Kinzo‐san's or Genji‐san's birthday."`
`"It isn't from my family either.`
` And it isn't Rosa's or Maria‐chan's."`
`"It's not anyone in mine, either...`
` And it isn't Kanon‐kun's or Shannon's."`
`"......I always give the servants presents on their birthdays, so I know it for all of them,`
` but I don't know anyone who was born on November 29th..."`
`Once we started imagining that the eight digits, which we had thought were meaningless,`
` were actually two dates written together, it really started to look that way.`
`......However, its true meaning may be something completely different, or there may be no meaning at all.`
`Anyway, since we don't have any real clue, it's probably pointless to stand around here analyzing it.`
`......More important was the inside of the parlor.`
`This morning, behind each of the doors with a magic circle drawn on them, there had been the body of a victim.`
`...And now that a number had been newly added to the door, what new thing {i:had been added} inside the parlor?`
`When Auntie Eva tried to open it, she felt the resistance of the lock.`
`{n}She immediately took out a master key, and put it in the keyhole.`
`As soon as she opened the door, ......Auntie Eva let out a high‐pitched scream and ran inside.`
`That alone was enough to tell us what had happened inside the room...`
`Doctor Nanjo and I looked at each other, and I shook my head slightly as we entered the parlor...`
`"George!!`
` Geooooorge!!`
` Speak to me...!!`
` Geoooooooooorge!!`
` Doctor Nanjo, quickly!!"`
`George‐aniki had fallen alongside Shannon‐chan's body.`
`His chest was stained bright red.`
` And from his still‐opened eyes,`
` ...all my condolences to Auntie Eva,`
` ......but I couldn't pick up any signs of life.`
`After moving to take his pulse,`
` ...Doctor Nanjo shook his head, wordlessly reporting that George‐aniki was dead.`
`Brushing him aside, Auntie Eva once again crouched beside George‐aniki,`
` and started crying at the top of her lungs...`
`With this, ...Aniki's death, one thing had become certain.`
`The murders would not be ending at the eighth twilight.`
`The epitaph was going to be carried out in its complete form, including the ninth twilight, "and none will be left alive"...`
`I'm really starting to lose the plot.`
`...For some reason, Auntie Eva's half‐insane cries and appearance actually made me cool down...`
`...Crestfallen and exhausted, I flopped onto the sofa,`
` and plunked my feet on top of the table.`
`Maybe all of these murders have paralyzed my heart.`
` ......Instead of fright, the stronger emotion I'm feeling is one of complete confusion.`
`Dad and Kyrie‐san have died, and starting with the servants, people have been killed off one by one.`
` ...And at one hell of a pace, too.`
`I don't know what time the first murders started,`
` ...but I'd say we're probably being killed at a rate of about one person an hour.`
`We believe that the boat will come for us around nine tomorrow.`
` ......There's still a full twelve hours until then.`
`...How many more sacrifices to the witch would there have to be for us to survive...?`
`With the four of us, if one goes each hour, ...we won't last any longer than four hours.`
` It's not clear anymore if we'll even last until midnight tonight...`
`......Yesterday, after lunch, we came into this parlor.`
`At about the time that the discussion had turned to the black tea that Auntie Rosa said she bought,`
` we kids had started talking about going to take a walk.`
`......Maria was fooling around.`
`...Didn't Shannon‐chan bring us some cookies?`
`She said that Kumasawa‐san had baked them, or something.`
`......I'd probably have laughed my ass off if there had actually been a cooked mackerel one mixed in with them.`
`............That's right, I'll never hear Kumasawa baa‐chan's mackerel jokes again, will I...`
`...Oh yeah, if I only remember stuff about Kumasawa baa‐chan, that wouldn't be fair to everyone else...`
`.........Why did Dad and Kyrie‐san...even go outside?`
`It's not like we'd die from being without food for a day.`
`...So why did gluttony get ahold of them and make them go to get food?`
`......I'll bet it was my fearless dad who started complaining about being hungry...`
`Kyrie‐san, you were supposed to be the brakes for my reckless dad...`
` Why didn't you stop him?`
`.........And what about your daughter Ange...?`
`...She's only six years old.`
`{n}You weren't thinking of entrusting her to me, were you...?`
`At this point, it's doubtful that even I will be able to leave this island alive.........`
`"St‐stop this...!!`
` Why are you fighting at a time such as this...?!`
` Jessica‐san, stop...!!"`
`......Some kind of commotion was interrupting my thoughts.`
`I looked up to see what it was, and saw that Jessica and Auntie Eva had started fighting each other at some point.`
`......No, maybe I should say that Jessica was grabbing at Auntie Eva.`
`"......You killed my mom and dad!!`
` There's no other explanation!!"`
`"Don't be stupid!!`
` How would I know anything about what happened to your parents?!"`
`"Who was downstairs in the guesthouse?!`
` You were!!`
` Mom and Dad were in the downstairs lobby, along with YOU!`
` Who was left alive?!`
` Only YOU!!`
` Why?"`
`"Because you're the {i:fucking murderer}, that's why goddammit!!`
` You killed Mom and Dad, carried them outside, and then shamelessly locked the door,`
` trying to make it seem like it was the frickin' witch's doing...!!"`
`"Then why did George go missing?!`
` He didn't come downstairs, you know?!`
` So did he disappear from upstairs?!"`
`"Who was upstairs?!`
` It was you people who were up there!!`
` You knew, didn't you?!`
` You knew that George slipped out of the mansion!!`
` You brazenly made a face as if you didn't know anything!!`
` If you had stopped George, he would, ......he would...!!!"`
`"I am telling you to stop...!`
` Jessica‐san was in the cousins' room the whole time!`
` And Eva‐san was also in the downstairs lobby the whole time!`
` And neither of you are responsible for anything!`
` This is only the sadness of losing your family...!!"`
`"The culprit is no one, is nowhere...!!`
` It is all.........just the witch's fault, that is all!!`
` So you two, please, stop hating one another...!!"`
`......The witch's fault, is it...`
`{n}I wonder if that's a good way to mediate things for now.`
`Yes, ...I finally understand the meaning of all of the doors and windows having been {i:locked from the inside} when three whole people evaporated from the guesthouse...`
`This is what they were after.`
`......Making us think the culprit was inside, ...and causing this ugly mutual hatred...`
`....had to be the culprit's......the witch's goal.`
`............But in that case, how had the culprit {i:locked it from the outside}...?`
`It's certainly true that the master key had been stolen when Dad's group was attacked.`
`...But the doors and windows to the guesthouse...`
`had been constructed so that you couldn't lock them from the outside no matter how hard you tried.`
`So that master key shouldn't mean anything for the guesthouse locked room...`
`......Jessica and Auntie Eva were turning their sadness at losing their blood relatives into anger at the person in front of them.`
`Doctor Nanjo was trying to step between them.`
`......And I sat haphazardly in a sofa staring up at the ceiling,`
` ......thinking about things that didn't even matter anymore with a worn‐out expression.`
`............I just couldn't believe that this was the same parlor that had been so warm and pleasant midday yesterday,`
` ...for just a short time before the typhoon hit......`
`"GYAAAAaAAaaAAAaaaAAA......`
`uWAA{0}AAuu{0}ughhaAA{0}AAUU{0}UUgghh{0}hhh...!!"`
`The sudden sound of a gunshot shook me out of my half‐asleep trance.`
`...Smoke was rising out of the barrel of the gun Auntie Eva held.`
`Jessica was rolling around on the floor, covering both her eyes.`
`Auntie Eva and Doctor Nanjo were looking down at her, shocked...`
`"A‐are you alright, Jessica‐san...?!`
` Jessica‐san...!!"`
`"UuuAaaaAAAaaaaHHHaHHHhhh,`
` oww, owwww, ow...`
`uuuaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaggghhh...!"`
`"I‐......it isn't my fault...`
` Th‐......this happened because you came at me even after I told you to stop...!"`
`"H‐...hey, hey, what the hell happened, what's going on...?!"`
`Jessica had grabbed at Auntie Eva, and it had turned into a scuffle...`
`They had then...started fighting over the gun Auntie Eva had been holding?`
`And some movement or other caused the trigger to be pulled...?`
`I didn't know the details, about whether the bullet had grazed her, or whether she had been burned by the discharge,`
` but whatever the case, Jessica was covering both of her eyes, screaming in pain, and rolling around on the floor.`
`"......It's alright, calm down...!`
` It is not a serious wound, so get ahold of yourself...!"`
`"My eyes hurt, it hurts...`
` ...I can't see,`
` ...I can't see......!!"`
`Doctor Nanjo lent Jessica his shoulder, saying that he would tend to her in the servant room.`
`......The servant room in this mansion apparently had a bed and a first aid kit, and was able to function as an infirmary.`
`"Damn iiiiiit!!`
` You killed Mom and Dad!!`
` I'll kill you... I'll kill you......!!"`
`"I‐......it wasn't me... It wasn't me......!!"`
`"Jessica‐san, you are aggravating the wound, so please, stop struggling...!`
` Come, let us go to the servant room..."`
`Jessica still continued to curse Auntie Eva as her parents' murderer.`
`{n}It seemed that Auntie Eva couldn't conceal her shock at the fact that she had pulled the trigger, even if it had been an accident.`
`"...It wasn't my fault... That kid jumped at me, that's why this happened......`
` ......I didn't kill anyone..."`
`"......No, forget that... Who killed George?`
` That's right, who killed George?!!`
` George, Geooooooooooorge!!`
` It isn't my fault, it isn't my fault...!!"`
`"W‐wait a sec, Auntie Eva...!!`
` Don't go off on your own!!"`
`I didn't know whether it was because Auntie Eva couldn't stand her mistake,`
` or whether it was because she had lost herself to anger at the person who had killed her only son,`
` ...or whether it was both of those all mixed together.`
`...In any case, she ran out into the corridor, yelling, fearful, and shouting.`
`I was also worried about Jessica's condition, but anyway, right then, I couldn't leave Auntie Eva alone.`
`Why would she go off on her own in this mansion, of all places? Is she suicidal...?!`
`Doctor Nanjo took Jessica towards the servant room.`
`...I chased after Auntie Eva, dashing into the depths of the mansion......`
`After sitting Jessica on the servant room bed,`
` Nanjo told her several times not to rub her eyes, and examined the affected area.`
`The barrel had probably been near her eyes.`
`{n}There was a possibility that the flames from the discharge had damaged her corneas.`
`...There was no threat to her life, but it would probably be necessary to have a suitable doctor look at her as soon as humanly possible.`
`Nanjo applied emergency first aid, covering the affected area with gauze and wrapping it with a bandage.`
` As a result, Jessica completely lost her field of vision...`
`"Now, pay attention...`
` This wound may hurt or itch, but you must not scratch at it or rub it.`
` When tomorrow comes, let us go to an ophthalmologist as soon as possible."`
`"......That bitch, ...she really was trying to kill me...`
` If the angle had been just a little bit off, I'd have been killed by now...`
` I'll definitely turn her in to the police......!"`
`"...Eva‐san would not do such a thing.`
` That was an accident."`
`"Accident my ass...!`
` She killed Mom and Dad.`
` There's no way any 19th person or witch exists on this island...!!`
` She's behind everything.`
` She was the only one on the first floor of the guesthouse!"`
`"George nii‐san must have seen her kill Mom and Dad, and she killed him to keep him silent!!`
` It's the same with Grandfather and the servants.`
` I'm sure she snuck out of the family conference last night and killed all of them...!!"`
`"......I‐if that is the case, then we will know as soon as the police investigate."`
`"The police are incredible, you know—there is nothing that cannot be understood by a forensic investigator.`
` ......There is no need for us to suspect or hate anyone.`
` The police will resolve everything."`
`"So for now, Jessica‐san, you should concentrate on resting your body and making things easy on your eyes.`
` ...If you wrinkle your forehead too much, it will do no good for your eyes, of course, and nothing for your looks either."`
`Indeed, when Jessica had grown agitated in her verbal abuse of Eva,`
` she had naturally started glaring, and the pressure on her eyes hurt her.`
`Jessica herself soon realized that the more she talked, the more the wound would hurt,`
` and regardless of whether she had overcome her suspicions of Eva, she regained her composure for the time being...`
`"......She killed them...`
` ......Mom and Dad.`
` ......And Shannon,`
` .........and Kanon‐kun...`
` ............Kanon‐kun........."`
`She had heard that Kanon had been killed in the chapel.`
`{n}...Jessica still hadn't seen his face after he had died.`
`Jessica was now less fearful about the fact that she might go blind,`
` and more frightened that the police would carry Kanon's corpse away while she still couldn't see,`
` and that she would have to say her final farewell without being able to see his face.`
`Her anger at the culprit, and her sadness at the death of the person she had liked.`
`{n}...Those mixed emotions provoked her tear ducts.`
`But right now, tears were actually painful for her,`
` so she wasn't even permitted to leisurely remember the late Kanon's face...`
`Jessica could do nothing but sit on the bed and let her head droop, withstanding the pain...`
`"..................`
` ...Well, now it is Eva‐san I must be concerned for.`
` I hope she isn't too shaken by this."`
`Letting out a small sigh of relief that Jessica had calmed down for the time being,`
` he stuck his head out into the hallway to look for any sign of the others coming back.`
`"..............."`
`They...met eyes.`
`{n}Nanjo, unable to understand who this person was, was bewildered for an instant.`
`"I hear that people who have lost the power of sight have zero anti‐magic power and zero magic resistance.`
` In other words, you're an isolated pawn right now.`
` Understand what that meeeans?"`
`"......Wh‐......what did you say......?"`
`There was no possible way that Nanjo could have understood who the person in front of him was.`
` ...And there was certainly no possible way that he could ever have understood what she had just said.`
`".........Doctor Nanjo?`
` What's going on......?"`
`Unable to see, Jessica couldn't tell what was going on except by whatever voice she heard.`
`{n}...But since she had heard Nanjo say something with an uneasy tone,`
` she tightened up, thinking that something bad might have happened.`
`"S‐......stop, please......!`
` Please don't kill me...!!`
` I have a sick grandchild...!`
` I can't die here...!`
` For mercy's sake, spare me...!!`
` HIIIii!!!"`
`"...Doctor Nanjo...?`
` Doctor Nanjo?!"`
`Jessica couldn't do anything except call out from the bed.`
`{n}...Judging by the tone of his voice, Nanjo was in the corridor, being confronted by someone.`
`And he was scared.`
` There was no doubt that at this very moment, his life was being threatened.`
`"No, don't!!`
` HiiiIIIIiIIIII!!!"`
`"On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive.`
` Kuhhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!!"`
`The witch pointed the end of her gold staff at Nanjo.`
`...Even though he didn't know what she was planning to do,`
` Nanjo imagined that she must be trying to take his life.`
`"Doctor Nanjo!!`
` Doctor Nanjo!!`
` Who's out there?!`
` Answer me!!"`
`"Please, nooooOoOOOo, ahii{0}ie{0}eeEAAH{0}HHhhh!!"`
`Bang!`
` A sharp sound echoed.`
`And tapered to a point just as sharp, the elongated tip of the golden staff was stuck straight into Nanjo's forehead...`
`Jessica, who only had her ears to help her try to grasp what was happening, had no clue what was going on.`
`...But even so, she was able to realize that with that sound, Nanjo had died.`
`And the person who had killed him was now in the corridor, right in front of the servant room.`
`{n}...Furthermore, since she couldn't see, she wouldn't even be able to run away, much less resist.`
`...Upon discovering that she was in a life‐or‐death situation, caught like a rat in a trap, Jessica felt her blood run cold...`
`"......Oh, Jessica.`
` Poor girl, you injured your eyes.`
` ...In that case, you can't even escape, can you?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*.`
` ...I'm gonna play a whole lot with Nanjo's corpse now.`
` ...When I get bored of that, I'll kill you next and play a bunch more."`
`"......No, wait, it's not every day that you get blinded, right?`
` ......I won't wait until I kill you.`
` I'll play with you a bunch {i:before} I kill you too.`
` ...Kuhhihya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya...!!`
` So wait there shaking for a while, okay?`
` As you try to imagine all the ways I'm playing with Nanjo's corpse!!"`
`"H‐...hiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!"`
`Struck with fear, Jessica let out a frail scream.`
`......She really wanted to scream in a much louder voice, trying to get someone to help her.`
`But she couldn't.`
`When a person is faced with true fear, it clogs up their throat...`
`Right now, Jessica could barely even breathe.`
`"H‐`
`......help...`
` ......Help.........!!`
` HiIIiiIiiIIi!!"`
`She searched around with her hands, trying to find some way to escape.`
` But even though she knew this room well, just being unable to see made it like a locked room of darkness.`
`She bumped into some shelves or something, and some tins of sweets and bottles and things fell down from them, hitting her on the head.`
`...As she was now, even protecting her head to block them wasn't working out.`
`...She was becoming painfully aware of how very powerless humans become just by losing their sense of sight.`
`{n}Of course, she had no time to appreciate that.`
`She crawled around, as best as she could, trying to escape that place,`
` but she kept bumping into things that she didn't understand, getting hit by various falling objects,`
` and it felt to her like the entire room was alive, bullying her and refusing to let her escape.`
`Then, she heard footsteps from the presence in the hallway.`
`{n}And then a voice.`
`......The person had probably peered into the room since Jessica was making so much noise.`
`"What a racket you're making.`
` Sit on the bed and wait quietly like a lady.`
` 'Cause I'll give you a wonderful blood‐red death costume fitting for a lady of class.`
` ......Something good enough to make the person who finds you faint, okay?`
` Gehhe{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}heh!!"`
`"Hii...hiiIIiiIIIIiiiiiiIIIi!!"`
`Just a short while ago, she had sworn that she would kill the culprit if she found them.`
`...However, she was now all too powerless.`
`She couldn't do anything except let out feeble screams and crawl around on the floor, bumping her head into the bed and the legs of desks.`
`"Help... Help......!`
` Someone, help......!!`
` Dad, ......Mom...!`
` Battleeeer......!`
` Someone, coooooooome...!!`
` .........Help me, ......Kanon‐kun.........!!"`
`In the corridor, as the witch thought of how to toy with Nanjo's life...`
`......a single gold butterfly secretly watched that scene from the corner of the hallway.`
`...It was Beato, who had barely escaped with her life once before.`
`The gold butterfly softly returned to human form.`
` ...Its form was faint and transparent like a lace curtain.`
`Even just the power to hold a human form had become scarce for her.`
`Right next to her, Ronove also appeared.`
`"......Jessica will probably be unable to survive.`
` ...Although, no one was to be left alive since the beginning."`
`"..................She has grown feelings of love for Kanon.`
` ......I have even toyed with that at times.`
` ............However, I know that now to be something shameful for a witch."`
`"......Love is the single element.`
` Romantic love is even more pure, more sacred.`
` ...Though, for some reason, you hate it very much, Milady."`
`".................................`
` ......Master told me.`
` ...Magic exists to bring people happiness.`
` ...I'm sure that I knew that once."`
`"......And from the moment I forgot that, I was no longer a witch.`
` ......So I...lost the qualifications to be Battler's opponent..."`
`".........Milady, I hesitate to ask, but...`
`...surely you do not intend to rescue Jessica?`
` That would be dangerous."`
`"I understand...`
` Even if I save her, she will become a plaything of the witch's banquet when the door to the Golden Land opens."`
`"......But even so, ...that would be much more compassionate than the way that person would kill her.`
` ...The witch's banquet steals lives in a terrible way, but it does not do so more than once.`
` It does not toy with life and death."`
`"...However, she is different.`
` She kills over and over.`
` She kills for fun!`
` There is not even a trace of compassion there.`
` .........I want to at least save Jessica from that kind of cruel fate."`
`"......Certainly, by carrying that out, you would probably be praised as a good witch."`
`"......However, the new {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama already views you as hostile, Milady.`
` ...If you were to be seen by her again, ......you are aware, you would have no way to escape this time?"`
`".......................................`
` ......When I reunited George with Shannon,`
` .........I finally understood what a witch is,`
` and what magic is."`
`".........I am a witch.`
` I must be a witch.`
` And I must be acknowledged by Battler as his opponent, ......and I must make him accept me as a witch this time at last."`
`"......The road to that goal may be long and difficult.`
` ...However, if I do not take a step forward here and now, ......I cannot call myself a witch."`
`"I understand your feelings, but how do you plan to rescue her?`
` There are not many forms of magic that your body is capable of now, Milady.`
` Did you not have to borrow George's power even back when you revived Shannon?"`
`"......Mm.`
` ...And for that very reason, I may be able to save Jessica at least."`
`"......Right now, she is begging for Kanon to save her.`
` ......If I can borrow the power of that emotion, I may be able to knock on the doors of Hades once again with my magical power."`
`"I am sure you would be able.`
` However, you would use up all of your magical power.`
` ......If you were to be spotted by the new {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, you would truly be without a method of escape."`
`"...I am no longer your butler, Milady.`
` ......Understand that I cannot assist you if the situation worsens."`
`"...I know.`
` .........By now, I have toyed with and taken more lives than I can count.`
` ...So I may not be able to compensate for that sin except by saving the same number of lives."`
`"......I have nothing to lose in the first place.`
` ...I am just a golden butterfly who has passed its name and magic power on, and who is no longer accepted as a witch."`
`".........What about Battler‐sama?`
` You are part‐way through a game with him.`
` He has said that he would wait until you returned, Milady."`
`"...Is it alright for you to expire here?`
` ...You have a duty to return to the seat across from Battler‐sama, Milady."`
`"For that very reason...!`
` If there is a life that only I can save, I choose to save it."`
`"And I will be accepted as a witch.`
` ......I must be a witch...!`
` If this is a test, it is a very childish one, unfitting for the evils I have committed until now."`
`"......Go, hide yourself, Ronove.`
` Watch what may be the final magic of a single butterfly who used to be called a Golden Witch...!"`
`"......Certainly.`
` ......Please show me magic...`
`...that will not disgrace the name of the Golden Witch.`
` ......I pray that it will not be your last."`
`"Go, my friend.`
` ...If there is enough ink, pen the story of my foolish life, and hand it to some fool attempting to walk the same path.`
` Farewell, Ronove...!"`
`"Kanon‐kun,`
` ......where are you...`
`where are you......`
` ...Help me,`
` ......help me...`
` ...uuuu...u...uuuu..."`
`.........Milady.`
` I am always...waiting by your side.`
`"K‐......Kanon‐kun......?`
` Kanon‐kun......?!"`
`Jessica thought that she had just heard Kanon's voice.`
` She looked around with unseeing eyes, but of course, there was no way for her to see anything.`
`...On the contrary, that action caused her head to hit the desk again.`
`"......Kanon‐kun, .........Kanon‐kun......`
` ...Help me, .........help me........."`
`Yes, Milady.`
` ...I will...help you.`
`"K‐......Kanon‐kun...?!`
` Y‐you were alive...?!"`
`This time, she thought that she had heard his voice clearly.`
`{n}Jessica jumped up in surprise, banging her head against the desk once again.`
`......Milady, please calm your heart and listen.`
`...Unfortunately, I am not alive.`
`".........Huh......?"`
`I have already...died.`
`......However, ...that witch came to me to tell me of your peril.`
`...Then, she gave me only a short period of time to help you, Milady.`
`Please, calm your heart even more.`
`If you do, ......my form will become visible even to you, Milady...`
`Jessica obeyed those words.`
`{n}She chased all idle thoughts from her head, and relaxed her breathing.`
`......Her heart actually felt like it was going to explode after hearing the voice of the loved one she thought was dead.`
`She resisted that with all of her strength.`
`......When she did, ......she could feel that Kanon‐kun really was right in front of her.`
`......Even though she was unable to see, ......somehow, she was still able to sense him clearly.`
`"......Can you...see me?`
` Milady..."`
`"Yeah...`
` I can see, ......I can definitely see you, Kanon‐kun..."`
`".........I exist only as a spirit.`
` So I cannot touch you, Milady.`
` I cannot do anything except talk to you like this.`
` ......I am a weak existence which can do nothing more than that, ...but I should be able to be of some aid to you, Milady."`
`"......Just words, ......that's all......?`
` I can't......touch you, Kanon‐kun......?"`
`"I am now even more fragile than smoke from a candle.`
` ...So much so, that if one of the living such as you were to touch me, I would be wiped away instantly.`
` ......So please, don't try to touch me.`
` ...Because I am also......holding back my desire......to touch you, Milady."`
`"Ah, .........y‐...yeah..."`
`"More importantly, Milady.`
` ......Please listen well.`
` .........The new Golden Witch is the owner of a cruel heart.`
` ...She will surely try to make you meet with a horrible end.`
` ......You must escape from this room and hide."`
`"H‐...how...?`
` I can't...see anything......!"`
`"Quiet...`
` ......I will be your eyes, Milady.`
` Please move in accordance with my instructions.`
` ......First, please crawl three steps from there, and then stand up.`
` You are currently under the desk, Milady.`
` If you stand there, you'll hit your head."`
`"...Th‐that was under the desk...?`
` I got it... One, two, three...`
` ...Standing up..."`
`"Well done......`
` Next, please turn towards nine o'clock.`
` .........Yes, well done."`
`"Ha, ......haha...`
` This is pretty...embarrassing...`
` ......Ah, ...ack, ...owowow..."`
`"Are you alright? Does your wound hurt...?"`
`"N‐No, ...I'm fine...`
` What next......?"`
`Jessica thought that if this was a dream, she didn't want to wake up.`
`{n}...And, if she were allowed to, she would have wanted to take off the bandage covering her eyes and see him.`
`...However, if she did that, surely Kanon would vanish like frail candle smoke, just like he himself had said...`
` ......She was afraid of that.`
`So she satisfied herself with just being able to hear his words once more,`
` repressing her desire to see him, to hold him.`
`So what hurt her eyes now were tears of gratitude.`
`{n}......Tears of gratitude for the god, ...or else witch, who had given her this miraculous moment.`
`"...Is this okay...?`
` If we keep talking like this, won't we be noticed by her?`
` Won't our voices be heard...?"`
`"......I have erected a stealth barrier.`
` If you don't make any loud noises or speak noisily, no one will notice.`
` ......That is why no one can notice my presence."`
`"...I, ...I don't really get it, ...but anyway, we'll be okay as long as we stay quiet, right...?`
` ......Wh‐what should I do next...?"`
`"Please walk ten steps, slowly, in the direction you're facing.`
` You will touch the sofa.`
` Please continue along that.`
` ......Do it slowly.`
` ......Stay calm.`
` Believe my words."`
`"Su‐......sure.`
` ............Heheh, ...it's weird...`
` ......Even though it was so scary not being able to see, .........when you're with me, Kanon‐kun, it isn't scary at all..."`
`".........Yes, that is the sofa.`
` Trace it to the left while advancing slowly...`
` There is a table just to the left.`
` Be careful not to bump into it with your shins..."`
`......It was a very, very peculiar and magical team effort.`
`Even though she would be killed in an instant if she was noticed by the terrible witch,`
` ......there was no fear in Jessica's heart right then.`
`She was being protected and guided by Kanon, who she had thought she would never be able to meet with again.`
`...It was probably only a momentary miracle.`
`{n}......But even so, Jessica was deeply grateful for it.`
`If she hoped for too much, she was sure that he would disappear—so, in order not to break this transient miracle...`
`...and in order to engrave this moment into her heart for all eternity...{0}she slowly...{0}slowly...{0}continued to walk...{0}obeying Kanon's voice...`
`"......Alright, if you walk ten more steps, you will exit the servant room.`
` Then, please turn to face nine o'clock, and keep walking very slowly.`
` Put your hand on the wall to your right, and keep on following that.`
` ...I will take you to a safe room."`
`"............If I go there,`
` ...will you...`
`.........leave me again, Kanon‐kun......?"`
`"..........................."`
`Kanon didn't answer.`
`{n}...But even his lack of an answer was enough to let her know that was the truth.`
`"......Then, ......no.`
` .........I don't want to go..."`
`"If you stay here, you will be killed by the witch."`
`"That's alright...`
` If I'm killed, I can go to the world where you are, Kanon‐kun..."`
`"......Milady,`
` please be reasonable.`
` ......For the dead such as myself, the human world is too bright and painful...`
` So I cannot stay for long."`
`"So Milady, ......with the time I am allowed, ......please permit me to guide you to a safe place.`
` ............And after that, .........I will stay with you until my time runs out."`
`".........Is that...the best you can do, Kanon‐kun......?"`
`"...Yes.`
` .........And in exchange, I will stay by your side for every second I can, Milady.`
` ......The whole time, I will be with you, ......and I will talk with you, Milady."`
`"Talk...about what...?"`
`"..................What would you like me to talk about...?"`
`"...Anything...that you're willing to..."`
`"......Well then...`
` ............I will tell you the story of a cowardly servant boy without courage.`
` .........About a foolish and pitiful boy who felt love for a lady as radiant as the sun, ...and who, even though those same feelings were confessed to him,`
` ......lost to his cowardice, and in the end, was not able to be true to himself while he still lived."`
`"...............Yeah...`
` Then, ...I want to tell one too.`
` .........The story of a cowardly girl, ......who couldn't muster her courage...`
`...to keep telling the boy she loved just how much she loved him."`
`"......And, ......about how God gave her a miracle to be reunited with that boy,`
` ............and how, when she was given one more chance to muster up her courage, .........she did."`
`".........I also......want to hear that.`
` ......So, for that reason as well, let us go.`
` ......To a safe place."`
`"......Yeah...`
` If I could be with you, Kanon‐kun, I would walk however long, however far...`
` I don't need eyes anymore.`
` If you told me to step forward, I would even take a step off a cliff."`
`"Thank you.`
` ...Well then, Milady.`
` Let us go.`
` The first ten steps."`
`"No... Not like that.`
` ...Not unless you call me............Jessica."`
`"......Understood.`
` .....................Well then, Jessica.`
` ...Take the first ten steps."`
`"Yeah.`
` Kanon‐kun......"`
`Quietly, quietly, Jessica and Kanon snuck slowly out of the servant room.`
`Directly around the corner, the witch could be seen cruelly looking down upon Nanjo's corpse,`
` but the witch did not even notice their presence.`
`However, Ronove, who was waiting at her side, met Kanon's eyes.`
`...Kanon thought "oh no", grimacing and blocking Jessica with his back.`
`"........................"`
`However, Ronove did not inform his master.`
`As though it had been his imagination that he ever spotted him in the first place, he pretended to know nothing.`
`......No, maybe he did appear to chuckle.`
`From a finger on one of Ronove's hands, which were joined behind his back, a single small gold butterfly appeared,`
` flying in front of Kanon as though guiding him.`
`It was undetectable by the master he served.`
`Kanon was surprised at the magic that butterfly held.`
`Because it was far more powerful than the stealth barrier Kanon had.`
`...He may not have known, but that power had originally been Ronove's.`
`...An imitation of that had been given to Kanon by Kinzo, and that was what Kanon was using now.`
`As that butterfly of stealth magic scattered gold scales, it grew smaller bit by bit.`
` ...It probably wouldn't last long.`
`......But without a doubt, even that would buy them enough time to get far away from the cruel witch.`
`"Alright, Milady...`
` Let's follow that wall and keep walking.`
` ...On and on.`
` And on."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......If I can be with you, Kanon‐kun, ......I'll keep on walking, on and on, as far as you want to go..."`
`Led and protected by the small gold butterfly,`
` ...the two who were separated by the wall between life and death slowly walked away towards the end of the corridor...`
`......There was no way that the evil witch would have any magic to notice their flight.`
`Until they had already disappeared down the other end of the corridor, the witch never noticed that Jessica had vanished...`
`By the time the gold butterfly that Ronove had cast out evaporated completely, ...Jessica had reached the parlor.`
`Even though she would have been able to make it this far in no time if she had been able to see, as she was now, it had been a long, long adventure.`
`"......Now, Milady.`
` We've reached the parlor.`
` I will now take you to the bundle of curtains by the window.`
` ...If you hide in there, you'll surely be safe."`
`"Inside the curtains...`
` Not bad.`
` I used to hide in there a lot, long ago."`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama..."`
`"...Huh?"`
`Kanon called the witch's name.`
` Jessica looked around in surprise, but being unable to see, she obviously couldn't find the witch...`
`Beato had appeared once again with a faint form.`
`{n}Kanon squared off against the evil witch, but Beato's expression was soft, ...and actually pitying.`
`"I don't understand what kind of whim drove you to revive me... Your feelings elude me."`
`"......It was a whim and nothing more.`
` ......No, ......this is how witches should be.`
` ...It took me one thousand years to realize that.`
` ...That is all... A foolish tale."`
`"Wh‐......who?!`
` Who's there...?!"`
`"...Milady, be quiet.`
` ......She is the witch, ...{f:5:Beatrice}...`
` .........I am in her debt, ......because she let me be with you one more time."`
`"............The witch.........{f:5:Beatrice}......"`
`"...I am unimportant.`
` I suggest you instead make haste in hiding that girl in the shadows of the curtains.`
` .........You probably do not have much time left.`
` You should spend it in a final conversation with Jessica."`
`"...A secret meeting inside a bundle of curtains... You two have quite the sense of style.`
` *cackle*cackle*..."`
`"Uh, umm, ............thank you, {f:5:Beatrice}...!!`
` Thank you for letting me be with Kanon‐kun......!!"`
`Jessica didn't know where Beato was, so she said that while facing in the wrong direction.`
`Perhaps because she found that funny, Beato snickered.`
`"I will now leave this room to the pair of lovers.`
` Evil witches have no need for tales of love, you see.`
` Allow me to retreat."`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...`
` ...Thank you very much."`
`"Hmph...`
` .........No need to thank me.`
` You know well that something like this isn't enough to compensate for all of the evil I have done."`
`"I give my gratitude to good witches as a parting gift.`
` ...I don't care about what happened before now, or what will happen in the future.`
` ......All I know is that, in this very moment,`
` ...you are without a doubt...a good witch."`
`"......You flatter me, furniture.`
` The next time we meet, I may be an evil witch who will not betray your expectations.`
` ......And with that, farewell."`
`Beato left the parlor and closed the door.`
`And mustering the last of her remaining magical power, she sealed the door.`
`The fact that those two had escaped into here would eventually be noticed.`
`...And now that the ninth twilight had been reached, no matter how much they struggled, their inescapable fate had already been decided.`
`However, until that final moment, they should be permitted the time to speak with each other of their love.`
`The witch poured out all of her magical power to protect their time together.`
`......So that no one would be able to defile their time alone together until the final moment.`
`Just then, ...Beato perceived something.`
`......Her body had been detected by a magical searching technique.`
`...The cruelhearted witch's furniture had sniffed this place out.`
`"............So, boorishness is the witch's way of doing things...`
` To think that she doesn't even intend to allow the two young ones to speak to each other of their love...`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!!"`
`"45, data received.`
` Comparing target, confirmed as the Predecessor Lady {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Analyzing parlor defensive wall.`
` Multilayered defensive wall, 72 layers, attack barrier and magic reactive armor.`
` Sniping into the parlor is impossible.`
` Data link to 410."`
`"410, data received. Nihi!`
` Then we've just gotta{0}{nobreak:{m:-5:——}—}{0}the Predecessor first nyeh.`
` Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}, permission to fire, please!"`
`"Go ahead and shoot.`
` ...Oh, and avoid her vital areas.`
` There's something I want to ask that old hag."`
`"410, firing.`
` Nihi!"`
`The Chiester Sisters' gold bow released a golden snake.`
`......It crawled down the corridor starting from the front of the servant room, drawing a soft, serpentine curved trajectory as it made for the parlor,`
` ...and struck through Beato's chest.`
`"..................guhahh......!!!"`
`Gold butterflies gathered, and the cruel witch showed herself there along with her furniture.`
`"......Predecessor‐sama.`
` You will not get away with obstructing us a second time."`
`"......ugh......u......... I never thought I would...`
` ......Still, the Chiester Sisters really have gotten rusty.`
` To think that they failed to bring me down.`
` ...And twice, at that...!"`
`Ronove spoke in a manner fitting for the witch's butler.`
`{n}As she pushed her pain aside, Beato grinned and spoke back.`
`"My, my apologies, Predecessor‐sama...!`
` We were ordered to avoid vital areas...!"`
`"As soon as there's an order, we can pierce you at any time.`
` Through your earring holes, your belly button hole, any hole you like.`
` Nihi!"`
`The gold snake that had shot through Beato grew even longer, drawing a helix like a morning glory vine, and awaited its next order.`
`...It was ready to pierce a vital spot as soon as the merciless witch told it to.`
`".........For what reason would someone like you, who is even more brutal than me,`
` make them avoid my vital areas?`
` New {f:5:Beatrice}...!!"`
`"I wanted to ask you.`
` ...I don't know what trick you used to escape, but we were under the impression we had taken you out, you know?"`
`"Why is it that even though you could have escaped by hiding, you took the risk of appearing again?`
` ......It can't be that you came back just to protect those two young people, surely?"`
`"......Well, ...who knows?`
` ......*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"And just a second ago.`
` Why'd you do something as soft as reviving the lovers and reuniting them?`
` ...The more I hear about you, the more I learn that I don't even reach up to your feet as an incarnation of evil."`
`"If you're like that, why did you suddenly start acting so mildly?`
` ......That's what I wanted to ask."`
`".........*cackle*cackle*!`
` Because I am brutal, I am fickle.`
` How could there be any meaning in asking that?"`
`"Chiester Sisters. Sew her."`
`When she ordered that, the gold snake that was curled in a helix and suspended in space...`
`moved as fast as a real snake going after its prey,`
` and pierced Beato's body multiple times from the front and the back, its golden tail drawing a {p:0:×} shape.`
`As the ruthless witch had ordered, it drew a cross‐stitch through Beato's chest.`
`The gold thread made a squeaking sound and tormented Beato...`
`Rather than a gold snake aiming for its prey,`
` it waited for orders in midair as if it was a sewing needle ready to sew Beato.`
`"When it comes to you, there's no way it was a whim.`
` ......I've heard about you.`
` And I've learned.`
` You are such an incarnation of evil that I don't even rise up to your feet.`
` I thought I was truly a fitting successor to you."`
`"......But you've always been in the way.`
` You always say warm, pleasant things that shock me.`
` ......What changed you?`
` You explored the depths of evil for one thousand years,`
` so I let you live just to find out...what happened to overturn that millennium?"`
`"......If you want to know, I suggest you too spend a thousand years finding out.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Sew her."`
`"Gwaahhhh!!!`
` Ackkah, ......gahah!!"`
`Beato's chest was once again sewn with a golden cross‐stitch.`
`It tightened once again, squeezing fresh blood from Beato's chest.`
`The intense pain it caused ran in conflict with its beauty to the eye.`
`".........You might actually be another one of those types who disappear when they die and don't leave a corpse.`
` So I'll kill you slowly."`
`"But if you answer my questions honestly, I'll kill you gently.`
` I'll give you a splendid, gorgeous death perfect for my predecessor.`
` I'll sink you in a coffin filled with water and roses.`
` Isn't that wonderful?`
` ...And you still won't talk?`
` About the reason for your change of heart."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...!!`
` Not answering what she is asked is also one of the pleasures of an evil witch."`
`"Sew her. Twice."`
`"Gyoah, gwuhaahh.........!!"`
`"Of course, you don't have to answer.`
` After all, that way I get to torture you.`
` Kuukuhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!!"`
`"The Endless Magic, the Infinite Magic, truly is wonderful.`
` ...When you think about it, this world is finite in every way.`
` The infinite cannot exist in the human world.`
` Because God is infinite, he deprived the human world of all infinities so that he could look down upon it."`
`"...So, in other words, the power of the infinite is the power of God!`
` A wonderful power where the more you play with it, the more fun ways of playing you find!`
` You used that power as you pleased for one thousand years and went on a rampage!`
` Why are you having a change of heart only now?`
` Don't tell me you just {i:miss} it now that you handed it over to me?"`
`"How could I miss it.`
` The Endless Magic is not magic as you believe it to be.`
` ...True magic is in a deep abyss that you most certainly cannot reach."`
`"And you realized what that is......?`
` What...is it?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Wander around for a thousand years without realizing that, you foolish witch."`
`"Sew her. Three times this time."`
`"Gwoah, gyuooh, ...guhh...!!!"`
`They continued embroidering Beato's chest with the gold thread.`
`{n}It tightened even more, causing Beato more and more pain...`
`"......Well, whatever.`
` I'm not the least bit interested anymore in what deep understanding some good‐as‐dead hag came to.`
` I'm bored now, so I'll kill you quickly.`
` If I kill you, the barrier to the parlor will be undone."`
`"......Then I'll torture Kanon and Jessica to death a whole bunch of times.`
` ......Being able to have two lovers as my toys at the same time, ......sounds fun, right?`
` Kuhhi{0}hi{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hhi{0}hi{0}hihihi!!`
` Kill her...!!!"`
`Without missing by a millimeter, the gold sewing thread shot through Beato's heart...`
`{n}That intense pain was worse than all of the pain before that put together.`
`Beato finally remembered the actual feeling of dying, which she had forgotten over one thousand years...`
`But, .........she couldn't die.`
` She must not die.`
`{n}If she died, the two in the parlor would be handed over to the brutal witch.`
`So she definitely couldn't die.`
`{n}She resolutely...refused to die...!`
`".........New {f:5:Beatrice}...`
` ...I have a request.`
` .........The lover's meeting between the two in the parlor is to be short.`
` .........In the amount of time an hourglass can measure, Kanon will probably disappear to Hades.`
` ...Would you please allow them that much time...?"`
`"No waay.`
` Tearing apart two who love each other is fun, isn't it?`
` You're the one who said it.`
` So I want to try it!"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*...`
` In that case, I cannot allow you to enjoy that pleasure...`
` *cackle*cackle*, it is fun, tearing lovers apart."`
`"Right?`
` I'm sure it must be, right?`
` So don't get in my way!!`
` Sew her more!`
` Sew, sew, sew!!"`
`"Nihi!`
` 410, understood!!"`
`The merciless gold sewing needle sewed its golden thread through Beato's heart over and over again.`
`......However, no matter how much it tightened, that heart did not stop...`
`"Khh......hhhhhhh...this isn't nearly enough...`
` You'll have to do better than this to kill me...!!"`
`"What are you doing?`
` Make this old hag stop talking.`
` Kill her quickly!"`
`"W‐...we are...!!`
` Even though we've sewn her heart in place several times,`
` ......her heart...w‐won't stop...!!"`
`"......Are you...immortal?"`
`"Of course not.`
` ......I've handed the endless over to you.`
` There is a limit to how many more times my heart can beat."`
`"...However, if by making it beat just one time extra, I can give the two in this room even slightly longer to themselves,`
` ......I'll continue that meager resistance for all eternity!!"`
`"Sew!!`
` Keep sewing until her heart stops beating!!"`
`"Guuh, guooooh, gwaa{0}aA{0}A{0}Aaa{0}a{0}aAA{0}A{0}AAa{0}ahhhh!!"`
`"...Wh‐......why doesn't she die?!`
` This is impossible...!!"`
`"Her heart is, ......sewn in place...`
` ......So why...doesn't it stop?!"`
`"Fine then, we'll make the heart explode from the inside nyeh...!`
` How pitiful, and you could have died cleanly if you hadn't resisted us!!"`
`The gold needle and thread made round trips over and over again as they spoke, and still Beato didn't expire...`
`The barbarous witch was at last starting to turn pale at how unnatural this was.`
`"............What in the world......are you...?"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` ......You probably cannot understand.`
` ......Even I didn't understand.`
` ......But still.`
` ...Somehow or another, it seems that this is true magic.`
` .........In other words,`
` ......I have now...`
`...become it.`
` ...I have become...`
`...a true witch!!"`
`"Center of explosion stabilized in heart interior.`
` Primed and ready!"`
`"Detonate!!!"`
`There was a deafening sound, .........and gold leaf and a flutter of gold butterflies were scattered around the area.`
`Beato's chest had...opened wide from the inside,`
` ......and from that, gold butterflies and gold leaf erupted, staining the surrounding area gold...`
`Then, Beato's body crumpled.`
`Like a puppet whose strings had been cut, ...she crumpled and sank down to the floor.`
`......However, in the air, a gold heart tied by gold threads floated, and continued to beat...`
`".........Wh‐.........what the, .........hiiiiii..."`
`"M‐......monster......hiiiiiiiiii...!"`
`When the Chiester Sisters saw that, they fell on their behinds in shock.`
`......Somehow, ......even though Beato had become nothing more than a heart, it still kept beating,`
` continuing to protect the barrier to the parlor.`
`...It was an immeasurably immense magical power.`
`...Impossible to measure.`
` In other words, infinite—and endless.`
`".........I, {i:I'm} the Endless Witch, right...?`
` .........Why is this old hag......still alive......after all of this......?!!"`
`"Chiester Sisters!!`
` Smash that heart!!`
` Quickly!!"`
`"I‐it's impossible, my apologies!`
` We cannot do it!!"`
`"............It is probably impossible.`
` No number of people could crush that heart.`
` ...Much less the likes of the soldiers who serve under His Highness the Dragon King."`
`"In that case,`
` an Endless Witch like me should be able to crush it, right?`
` My power is a god's power!!"`
`"I am afraid to say,`
` that your power...`
`cannot leave a single scratch on {i:{f:7:Beatrice}‐sama's} endless nature."`
`"......Just what...do you mean by that......"`
`"In the same way that there is no light without knowledge of shadows,`
` ......there is also no endless without knowledge of the limited.`
` .........Before Milady {f:5:Beatrice}'s true endless power, your flimsy magical power is very, very lacking."`
`"What is.........that supposed to mean......"`
`"...aah—"`
`The cruel witch stepped back in surprise.`
`It was more transparent than a lace curtain...`
`......but Beato's form—no, {i:{f:7:Beatrice}'s} form—was still standing there.`
`Even after taking on this wretched appearance, ......she would not allow evil through that door.`
`At that time, ......a shadow just as faint as {f:5:Beatrice} stood behind her.`
`It was Kanon.`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` ...Thank you very much.`
` ...I will not forget this favor you have done for me."`
`"......Hmph.`
` ...I shall hear those words again when the number of my favors surpasses the number of grievances I have caused.`
` ......Are you done?"`
`"Yes.`
` .........Truly, thank you very much.`
` ......And {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama,`
` ......you have also...done enough.`
` ......Please,`
` ......be at peace..."`
`"......Is that so...`
` ......So this...is enough......`
` .........ku......*cackle*cackle*cackle*..."`
`"What's going on...?`
` ......Why are you guys calling that predecessor hag {f:5:Beatrice}?!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} is {i:my} name, right?!`
` It should be my name, as the new Golden Witch and Endless Witch, right?!"`
`"............What gall.`
` How dare you assume {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's name."`
`"I am afraid to say...`
`...that the name of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama should be taken by the person who can be crowned as the Endless Witch.`
` By now, the term "predecessor" refers to you.`
` ...Pukkukukukuku."`
`"What......did you say......?"`
`".........Farewell, Kanon.`
` ......I'll meet you soon anyway.`
` In a new nightmare."`
`".........In the nightmare of a new night, I will once again be your companion, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...`
` ......With that, ...if you would excuse me......"`
`Kanon's form grew faint, ......and he disappeared into thin air.`
`After watching him go, ...{f:5:Beatrice}'s form also grew faint, ......and before disappearing, it slumped over onto the floor.`
`Then, ......there was a splat.`
`The golden heart which had been floating in midair...had lost its sparkle, become blood‐stained flesh, and fallen to the ground.`
`...How frail it was.`
`{n}It was ragged and full of holes.`
`...But until just now, it had sparkled so much, and had continued to beat forcefully.`
`That heart still barely managed to beat.`
`......However, it was only a matter of time before it stopped.`
`{f:5:Beatrice}, whose form had become fragile and faint like incense smoke, lay on the floor,`
` ......steadily watching her own heart...`
`There, the cruel witch could be seen...`
`"...H‐...how are {i:you} "{i:endless}"...?`
` Face reality, you're collapsed in a heap on the floor, aren't you?!"`
`"Endlessness with limits...that's a contradiction, it can't possibly exist!`
` This is the limit of your magic!`
` The limited is inferior to the infinite!!"`
`"...................................."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} no longer had the energy even to respond.`
`{n}...No, in fact, it was doubtful whether the words of the cruel witch even reached her ears...`
`"If you're a real Endless Witch, try standing up!!`
` Well?`
` You can't, can you?!`
` Why do you think you can't stand?!`
` It's because you aren't an Endless Witch!!"`
`The merciless witch poked {f:5:Beatrice}'s heart with her fingernail.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} had no words with which to respond to that provocation.`
`......However, ...instead of words, she returned a single expression.`
`{n}......It looked insulting only to the cruel witch.`
`Because she had gently curved her mouth, ......and smiled.`
`......Footsteps were approaching that place.`
`There was no way she could mistake them.`
` ...That boisterous noise of shoes against the ground was the sound of Battler's footsteps...`
`".........Battler, is it.........`
` .........ku, ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*...`
` ...For all my talk, ...I've ended up like this......"`
`"................................."`
`"............I've been trying to become...`
`...the true witch you talked about,`
` .........in my own way......"`
`"...Yeah.`
` ......I was watching."`
`"......Hey,`
` ......have I now...`
`......been able to...`
`...become a witch......?`
` ......Have I earned the qualifications to become...`
`...your opponent......?"`
`"No good."`
`Battler said that unbelievably bluntly.`
`Taking a painful breath, {f:5:Beatrice} saw that, and sneered at herself as though she should have expected it.`
`"............ku, ...*cackle*...`
` ...Is that so.`
` ......It seems I still have an uphill struggle ahead of me on the road to becoming a true witch..."`
`"......However, ...I will not surrender...`
` ......Just like you never surrendered to my torture...`
` .........I will definitely......become a true witch,`
` ......and be...accepted as......your opponent......"`
`"Yeah, it's no good.`
` It's no goddamn good at all.`
` You aren't my opponent."`
`The brutal witch raised her foot high...`
`{n}...Below it was {f:5:Beatrice}'s frail heart.`
`"Die, you old hag!!`
` See if you can show how endless you are after you've been mushed to bits!!`
` I am the witch!`
` I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!!`
` Diiiiiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iieee!!"`
`{e:170:"Yeeeeeahhhh, it's no good, it's no goddamn good at aaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaall!!!"}`
`"Wha‐.........what...`
`...is this......?`
` ...Wh‐.........where am I......?"`
`"Get in your seat.`
` My opponent isn't Beato.`
` .........It's you."`
`"......B‐...Battler...?!`
` What kind of magic is this?!`
` Who cares, it doesn't matter!!`
` Chiester Sisters!!"`
`"45, understood, individual firing!!"`
`"410, understood, die Battler!!"`
`The Chiester Sisters each readied their own golden bows, and fired golden arrows.`
`The two only pulled the bowstring together when using precision guidance.`
`{n}If they were fighting against an enemy before their eyes, they fired their bows at the same time.`
`And the power was no different from what it normally was.`
`"Wha......... I‐i‐it was deflected?!?!`
` There's no barrier, it was deflected with resistance alone...`
` F‐...45, target measurement!!"`
`"45, understood...`
` ............huh, ......whaaaa...?!`
` Th‐this is... ...Am I broken?`
` The measurement is...going berserk......?"`
`"A‐anti‐magic resistance, endless nine...`
` E‐even mythical‐class magical attacks have no effect on the target!!"`
`The warheads of the golden bows could penetrate any magical armor with their mutual corrosion.`
`When attempting to block that using the anti‐magic resistance stat, even something with eight digits wouldn't escape penetration.`
`...Furthermore, even among the famous gods that appear in myths, there are not many who reach a resistance stat of nine digits.`
`For that reason, nine digits were enough to measure almost all imaginable values.`
`...Battler had filled all nine of those digits with 9's......`
`"......How foolish.`
` When Battler‐sama is serious, mere magical arrows cannot even succeed in making his hair tremble."`
`The Chiester Sisters dropped their golden bows in shock...`
`...To this Battler, it felt even less perceptible than two dragonflies passing by his sides.`
`"............What the hell are you guys doing?`
` Are you playing or something?"`
`"...Hiiiiiii...`
` ...M‐......monster......"`
`"If your name's not Eva, get the hell out of here!!`
` And you get in your seat, you goddamn fake witch!!`
` I'll tear that mask of yours off!!!"`
`""H‐...hiiiiiiiiiiiii!!""`
`The Chiester Sisters couldn't hide their fear at Battler's ferocity, and they backed up as though they had been struck.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} watched this scene in shock......`
`"B‐......Battler,`
` ......what......is this supposed to be......?"`
`"Just what you're seeing.`
` My opponent isn't you."`
`"It's her!!`
` The impostor over there, who's assuming your name!!!"`
`"Gh...!"`
`"......I'm fighting against witches.`
` ...And my method of denying them is to make anyone who calls themselves a witch my opponent, and crush them.`
` ......I've seen more than enough of your arrogance."`
`Then, Battler's eyes grew as sharp as blades as he fixed his eyes on the cruel witch.`
`"......Magic, my ass.`
` Witches, my ass!`
` You aren't a witch!!`
` I'll rip that mask off and tear it to shreds!!`
` {f:5:Virgilia}, get ready to fight!!"`
`"Understood.`
` Preparations are complete, so go whenever you're ready.`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` You stay back and rest."`
`"M‐mm......"`
`Beato looked at Battler timidly.`
`{n}...She still hadn't been acknowledged as his opponent.`
`{n}Was she qualified to watch the game board from the sidelines...?`
`"Beato, stay back and watch!!`
` I'll tear it off!!`
` I'll take this fake witch completely apart!!`
` I won't let someone like this call themselves a witch!!`
` You protected the honor of true witches!"`
`"Uh, ...I, umm......"`
`"You don't need to say anything."`
`"On your behalf, I'll teach her that the name of the Golden Witch definitely isn't that cheap!!"`
`".........B‐.........Battler..."`
`"Those are the general rules."`
`"............Thanks, Ronove.`
` I get most of the rules now."`
`"...I see.`
` You can't win with magic, so you came to face off with me in a world where victory is decided by something other than magic."`
`"......Foolish people.`
` You really think you can win against me with twisted logic?!"`
`"Damn right I do.`
` I'll crush all of your twisted logic, Aunt Eva!!"`
`"I, I am not Eva...!!`
` That is the name of the old shell that I shed.`
` I am a true witch, born inside of her...!!"`
`"Don't try to trick me! Your true form isn't a witch or anything like it, but a flesh‐and‐blood human.`
` The human culprit, Ushiromiya Eva!!!`
` {f:5:Virgilia}, reconstruct the second twilight!!"`
`"Understood."`
`"On the second twilight, Rosa and Maria were killed in the rose garden.`
` We make our first move by applying the Eva culprit theory."`
`"Huuh?`
` Riiidiculous!`
` Come, arise, try to remember!`
` What form did Ushiromiya Hideyoshi have?!!"`
`"Whaat?`
` What's this supposed to be?"`
`"......It's summoning of the dead.`
` It is easy for a witch to bring even the dead to the stand for testimony..."`
`An Uncle Hideyoshi who you could see right through was summoned.`
`...Magic sure is convenient.`
`{n}He looked as though he couldn't see what was going on here, almost like a person on the other side of the TV.`
`"Witness summons.`
` Ushiromiya Hideyoshi's testimony.`
` Come, Hideyoshi, speak...!"`
`"......I was takin' care of Eva in the room the whole time.`
` Eva didn't leave the room either, of course."`
`"Aunt Eva.`
` Around here, testimony that isn't red isn't worth crap."`
`"I demand that he repeats it again in red!!"`
`"Oh yeah, that's right.`
` Sure, say it in red for him!"`
`"`
`{p:1:I was in the room the whole time}.`
` {p:1:Both before and after the time period of the crime}."`
`"See, look.`
` This makes it impossible for Eva to be the culprit!`
` How will you counter this?"`
`"Ridiculous.`
` That move's so pathetic, I could yawn.`
` ......Beato never used such childish tricks, not even once."`
`".........Battler..."`
`"Repetition requested!!`
` "Aunt Eva was also in the room the entire time, before and after the time period of the crime"!!"`
`"Uncle Hideyoshi was just there to create an alibi.`
` You made Uncle stay in the room and stealthily snuck out.`
` ......If that isn't true, this guy should be able to say so in red!!!"`
`"D‐decline repetition...!`
` Hideyoshi's testimony is sufficient!!`
` There's no need to repeat that, right?!"`
`"......She's backed down.`
` Mercy is unnecessary.`
` This is check."`
`"Yeah, I'll take it. This opponent is a piece of cake!!"`
`"Check!!`
` Maybe Uncle Hideyoshi didn't leave the room the whole time.`
` But saying he was taking care of you the whole time...is a barefaced lie!"`
`"Therefore, no alibi exists for you!!`
` You had a chance to slip out of the room and kill Auntie Rosa and Maria!`
` If you think you can dodge that, try proclaiming in red that "Auntie Eva didn't take a step outside of the room"!!"`
`"You can't, right?`
` Checkmate!!!"`
`"Wh‐.........what is that......?!`
` I, ......I don't get it...!!"`
`"Sorry, Auntie.`
` ......Even if you aren't used to the rules, beating your opponent down with all your strength is how this game is played.`
` ......Isn't it, Beato?!"`
`"M‐...mm..."`
`"The witch side resigns.`
` Let us continue on to the next game.`
` Next is the fourth twilight through the sixth twilight."`
`It seemed that the witch still didn't understand how to approach things, and was losing her composure in irritation.`
`She was probably also angry that a shot had been taken at her while she still didn't get what was going on.`
`...But I won't go easy on her at all.`
`Just like she didn't go easy on the victims at all, I won't go the slightest bit easy on her...!!`
`"{f:5:Virgilia}, next crime!`
` Let's reconstruct the incident with Dad and the rest!!"`
`"Understood."`
`"Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi: these three people went to the mansion, and were killed there."`
`"My move won't change.`
` Aunt Eva, {i:you} are the culprit!!"`
`"This time, you don't even have an alibi from Uncle Hideyoshi!!`
` You claim that you were sleeping in that room all by yourself.`
` But that is untrue!!!`
` If you can proclaim it in red, just try it!!"`
`"......I refuse.`
` ...So tell me then!`
` Eva is just a woman.`
` And the people who were killed were three adults holding two guns, right?"`
`"How did she kill them all by herself?`
` How did she do it with those stakes as weapons?`
` How is this stake‐shooting device that everyone keeps talking about constructed?!"`
`"Explain that!!`
` As long as you can't explain it, even if Eva doesn't have an alibi,`
` it doesn't mean that it was possible for Eva to commit murder!"`
`"Decline explanation!!`
` It's a "Devil's Proof"!`
` You can't refute the existence of an unknown murder technique or an unknown weapon just because it's impossible to explain!!"`
`"In short!!`
` Even if I can't explain how the stake‐shooting device is constructed, that doesn't disprove its existence!!"`
`"Wh‐what is that?!!`
` Is that madness allowed?!"`
`"......‘Devil's Proof’, valid."`
`"Agreed.`
` "Devil's Proof", valid.`
` ......Battler‐kun can claim that a stake‐shooting device exists without bearing the responsibility of explaining how it is constructed.`
` The witch side cannot object to this move."`
`"......N‐not bad...`
` How pushy..."`
`"Heh!`
` Well, there's this ill‐natured witch who trained me well.`
` This is check, got it?!`
` Try saying in red that Auntie Eva didn't take a step out of that room!!"`
`"That's right, there's no way you'll be able to say it!`
` If you can't say it, it's over, checkmate!!"`
`"......Th‐......that's so irrational.........!`
` This is...messed up...!"`
`"Those are the rules of this game.`
` ...How about some black tea first?`
` We also have some delicious cookies, you know."`
`"I don't need all that!!`
` Oh, that pisses me off...!`
` So you fight like a coward just because you can't win with magic...!!"`
`"Don't get irritated.`
` Drink some black tea or something.`
` I'll take mine straight.`
` What about you, Beato?"`
`"I, ...I am fine...`
` .........More importantly, Battler, don't let your guard down.`
` Your opponent is merely unfamiliar with the rules.`
` ...It will start in earnest once your opponent gets the feel for it..."`
`"But I'll crush her.`
` I'll thoroughly crush her.`
` That's because she isn't a witch."`
`"If I accept her as a witch, ......all of your stubbornness counts for nothing!`
` I don't care what kind of irrational argument or twisted logic I have to use,`
` I'll crush her with all of my heart and soul!!"`
`Battler's side then stuck with the "Eva culprit theory" to explain Krauss and Natsuhi,`
` the seventh and eighth twilights, in the exact same way.`
`At that time, there had been no one on the first floor of the guesthouse except for Eva and the victims.`
` ...As before, no one could establish an alibi for Eva.`
`At the time, Eva had claimed that they had disappeared while she was in the lavatory,`
` but nothing supported that, and the witch side couldn't repeat that in red either.`
`With the same argument as she had used to ask about the construction of the shooting machine,`
` the witch side asked once more how Eva could have strangled both of them at the same time all by herself,`
` but of course, Battler splendidly counterattacked by refusing to explain because of the "Devil's Proof".`
`Under the storm and stress of Battler's spirit, the witch side was completely swallowed up,`
` and was forced to resign three times during the short period of time she had to grasp the rules...`
`".........Kuhhihihihihyahhyahhhya...`
` Hah, I see!`
` I'm finally starting to get the knack of it.`
` I won't let things go the way you want them to any more!"`
`"This time, let me take the initiative.`
` Ronove, reconstruct the fourth through the sixth twilights!`
` Pick out Ushiromiya Kyrie!`
` ......For now, let me return to the murders of Rudolf, Kyrie and Hideyoshi for the fourth through sixth twilights."`
`"......Wh‐...what is she thinking?`
` Why would she return once more to a board state she has already resigned from?"`
`"I see...`
` ...This is a rare attack, which you do not use.`
` Be careful."`
`"At the time, the survivors were barricaded in the guesthouse.`
` They didn't have food, but out of concern for their safety, they were at least prepared to go without eating until the next day.`
` ......However, in the end, three of them went out for food."`
`".........That's right.`
` In the end, three people went outside to get food."`
`"I'll add in some red as I speak, 'cause it'll be a pain otherwise.`
` {p:1:Kyrie didn't think that they needed food}.`
` Since going without food for about a day wouldn't kill them,`
` {p:1:she claimed that they should not leave the guesthouse}."`
`"And yet, she herself...`
`{p:1:suggested that they leave the guesthouse to get food}.`
` .........Isn't this a contradiction?"`
`"Yes, a spectacular contradiction.`
` It contradicts Kyrie's pattern of behavior."`
`"That contradiction...`
`{i:was created by me, using magic}!`
` In other words, I controlled Kyrie using magic, and made her say that to lure the sacrifices outside!!"`
`"R‐ridiculous!`
` There's no way that kind of magic exists!!"`
`"It's a "Devil's Proof", though!`
` Just because you don't know about that magic doesn't disprove its existence!`
` And I don't bear the responsibility of acting out that magic for you.`
` And yet, you still have no room to counter this argument!!"`
`".........*giggle*giggle*!`
` I wonder if it's alright to fight this way."`
`"Yes.`
` It is truly a spectacular move.`
` ......Battler‐sama, your response, if you please."`
`"You sure have brought in a weird argument.`
` ...Run that by me again?"`
`"She has made a play against Ushiromiya Kyrie's pattern of behavior.`
` ...As has already been explained,`
` Kyrie's pattern of behavior had her saying that they should not go outside and head to the mansion in order to get food."`
`"Yet, even so, she took the initiative,`
` and took the contradictory action of suggesting going to get food.`
` As long as you cannot explain this contradiction, this violent move claims that it was due to magic."`
`"...Well, Kyrie‐san probably thought that too in the beginning."`
`"But she probably, uh, ...thought about various things midway,`
` and had a change of heart, deciding that food really was necessary...`
` It would be a problem if, due to hunger, we had no energy when we most needed it...and, well..."`
`"......She is claiming that this change of heart is due to magic.`
` In short, ...while it might be extremely difficult, you must explain the reason for Kyrie's change of heart."`
`"Wh‐......what...?`
` ...But that's asking me what was inside Kyrie‐san's own head..."`
`"Can't I also summon Kyrie‐san's ghost and question her or something?!`
` Beato!`
` Can't you call Kyrie‐san here or something?!"`
`"She cannot.`
` That is a move permitted only to the witch side."`
`"S‐......sorry..."`
`"......Aaaaaaahhh, damn it!!`
` She was probably, umm, ......thinking of us kids and, umm, ...on the whole, thought that food really was necessary and..."`
`"You must make that claim objectively.`
` ...You require tangible evidence of the specific reason for which Kyrie changed her mind and decided that food really was necessary.`
` ......For example, if someone heard her say that, or if it was written down somewhere."`
`"Too bad,`
` {p:1:no reason for her changing her mind was ever told to anyone, nor was one ever written down}!`
` Therefore, you can only speculate as to what was inside Kyrie's mind!"`
`"So it is impossible to prove!!`
` You don't have a single counter to my move!`
` It's your turn to resign now, Battler‐kuuun...!!"`
`"......It is possible to hypothesize endlessly as to the reason behind her change of heart.`
` And, it is impossible to crush all of those endless possibilities."`
`"A detestably spectacular move.`
` .........If Battler‐sama were to have a method of countering, ...it could probably only be that move."`
`"Wh‐......what move is that...?"`
`"......Well now.`
` I wonder what kind of move it could be.`
` I have the feeling that it was Milady's specialty, but I cannot remember."`
`"..................kh...`
` Quit being stingy and tell me...!"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` There is no answer that will be given to those who stop thinking themselves.`
` ...Think.`
` Think in your own way!"`
`"Why don't you resign right now?`
` And I'll corner you even more with red.`
` {p:1:Until the last instant before she died, Kyrie maintained her pattern of behavior which states ‘I won't go to the mansion to get food’}!"`
`"And yet, she took the initiative and headed for the mansion.`
` She was pushing a cart, trying to carry food.`
` Why that contradiction?`
` ......Because I controlled her with magic!!!`
` This is the proof that my magic exists, and that I am a witch!!"`
`"...............Shut your damn mouth...!!"`
`"A‐...are you saying that she never even changed her mind?!`
` ......The whole time until she died, Kyrie‐san thought "we don't need food", "I won't go to the mansion"?`
` Then why did she step forward herself and say that they should go to get food, and go to the mansion...?!!"`
`"Are you saying that Kyrie‐san was being controlled with magic?!`
` That's stupid...!!`
` How, ...how am I meant to break through this magic?!"`
`"...If only Kyrie‐san were here, and just told us the reason behind her change of heart...`
` No, I've already been told in red that she never even changed her mind...!`
` What should I do...?!!`
` There's no move that the human side can counter with!!"`
`"The more I learn about this game, the more advantageous the rules seem for the witch, don't they?`
` Even if the witch loses in a lot of areas, if she can win in just one, with that alone she can flaunt her existence."`
`"......In other words, Battler‐kun, you have no way of denying witches other than a complete victory!"`
`"You called me Eva all those times and seemed to be under the impression that you'd been cornering me,`
` but it's all been turned over by nothing more than the inside of your respected Kyrie‐san's head, don't you think that's truly funny?!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!`
` Just do it, resign!!`
` Why don't you just accept it forever?`
` Why don't you just lose forever?!"`
`".........Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiit...`
` It's impossible for a human to show...`
` I can't do anything but guess what the dead were thinking when they acted.`
` Furthermore, I can't deny magic just by conjecture.`
` ...To break through magic, I need objective evidence as to why Kyrie‐san had a change of heart..."`
`"......But damn it,`
` it's been said in red that no evidence exists as to why she started wanting food...`
` ......What should I do, damn it, damn it...!!!"`
`".........Battler‐sama.`
` May I take it that...you resign?"`
`"...........................kh.........`
` "I won't go to the mansion to get food".`
` But how should I understand Kyrie‐san's thoughts, which actually do contradict......?!"`
`"You can't understand!!`
` It's impossible to understand, and impossible to interpret!!`
` That darkness is all of the witch!"`
`"Come on, it's useless to think, so quit, alright?!`
` There's no way you can deny witches!`
` I mean, look at me, {i:I exist}."`
`"I am the Golden Witch!!`
` I stole that name from that former witch over there!!`
` You can't deny that I am {f:5:Beatrice}!!!"`
`"Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit...!!!`
` You have no right to say that name...!`
` ......And yet, ......I can't think of a move to deny that.........!!!"`
`Battler could no longer counter this witch who was laughing derisively in triumph...`
`He didn't want to give up, but he could do nothing.`
`He ground his teeth, making fists with both hands.`
`{n}......But even so, he couldn't think of a brilliant counterattack...!`
`"Battler‐sama.`
` ......You are closing in on the time limit—will you resign......?"`
`"Kh......aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh......!!!"`
`".........The human side has no move in response.`
` We will res—"`
`"Wait!`
` ......Th‐there is......a counterattack."`
`"Wh‐......what did you say...?"`
`"Huh?!`
` What kind of move can you possibly have, Predecessor‐sama?!`
` Care to tell me what kind of move can deny my magic, the magic of {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` You can't, it's impossible!!"`
`"......If the proposition "I won't go to the mansion to get food" cannot be explained by itself,`
` ......I will explain it with the contrapositive.`
` In short, you may also be able to explain it with "she did go to the mansion, therefore there was a goal other than food"."`
`"......R‐rather than my specialty "Hempel's Raven", ......this is Battler's specialty, "chessboard thinking"."`
`"......If it is impossible for Kyrie to have gone to the mansion with food as a goal,`
` we can only explain it with another goal which caused Kyrie to go outside in any case.`
` In other words, if we can establish that goal, we can defeat magic...!"`
`"I, I see...`
` So she didn't go to the mansion with food as a goal, but had a different goal,`
` and said that she wanted to go and get food in order to disguise her real goal..."`
`"......Y‐...yeah, if that's the case, it may still be possible to explain it.`
` ......But......how?!"`
`"Master, reconstruct the scene where Kyrie died...!`
` We cannot summon a ghost, but inspecting the corpse should be the human side's right..."`
`"Yes, that poses no problems.`
` I will reconstruct the scene where Ushiromiya Kyrie died."`
`"We cannot call Kyrie's ghost here,`
` but by learning what Kyrie left behind, we may be able to use that as a weapon."`
`"Ha, hahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Fine, search as much as you want!!"`
`"There's no way you'll learn anything!`
` I just said it in red a short while ago.`
` {p:1:Kyrie did not leave anything written down}!`
` No matter what you find, how could you understand anything!!"`
`".........We may find nothing...`
` ......But, ......Battler is grinding his teeth, fighting to think of a move to break through you.`
` .........This is all that I can do......"`
`Beato landed on her feet in the reconstructed hall,`
` approached Kyrie's fallen body, and wandered around observing.`
`"I, I don't quite understand the process of how the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} side fights...`
` .........Evidence was required, was it...?`
` ......Then what should I search for?"`
`"The purported Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice} is getting down on her knees and crawling around!`
` And she's even disgracefully searching a corpse?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*, how that look suits you...!!"`
`"...Say what you wish...`
` ......I cannot do any more than this...`
` ......I do not care how I am mocked..."`
`".........However, I cannot abandon Battler, as he is fighting for my honor...`
` ......Even if I must crawl on the ground and search through dead flesh,`
` ......I must answer to that responsibility..."`
`While being subjected to the witch's sneers, Beato searched through Kyrie's corpse.`
`{n}......She fished through the pockets, taking out what was inside and laying it on the floor...`
`Laid on the floor,`
` ......was a handkerchief,`
` tissue,`
` a key to her house,`
` the stub of a plane ticket,`
` a lighter,`
` a cigarette butt,`
` and a single hundred‐yen coin...`
`There was no special, suspicious object...`
` Although Beato was down on all fours and being sneered at, that was all she could find.`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` What's with that wretched looking trash?!`
` Come on then, how are you gonna break through my magic with that stuff?!"`
`"Worthless, worthless, you look so duuuumb!!`
` What's with this state of affairs after you butted in sounding all heroic?!`
` Aaah, how pathetic, how embarrassing!!`
` Why don't you just give up and die forever?!"`
`The witch fell over laughing, taunting Beato.`
`{n}...Beato hung her head, trying to withstand this shame.`
`"...Milady,`
` are you satisfied with your inspection?"`
`".........M‐......mm...`
` ...I......will not find any more than this..."`
`"From this evidence, can some move be made to counter?`
` If not, then the human side must resign."`
`".....................khhh........."`
`"Obviously! You don't have any room to argue back!!`
` I am a witch.`
` You can't break through my magic!!"`
`"You're no longer anything but a former witch.`
` Just a loser who isn't even allowed to take the name {f:5:Beatrice} anymore!!`
` Go on, pile up as much trash and rubbish as you like, and try to break my magic with it!!"`
`"...You can't, right?`
` You can't, can you?`
` Kuhhihihihihi, and why's that?`
` It's because I'm a witch.`
` ...It's because you're just a loser without a name!!`
` Kuhhi{0}hhyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah!!!"`
`".........Something, ............something should be here......`
` .........I won't lose heart...`
` ......I will not lose heart......`
` No matter how much I am sneered at......Battler is fighting for my honor,`
` ......so for the sake of his honor, ...I must not lose heart........."`
`As Beato held back tears at the words of humiliation she was being showered with,`
` in the hope that Kyrie was holding something else, ......in the hope that she could find something that could save Battler from his plight,`
` ......she searched earnestly.`
`...However, nothing more came up......`
`"...............Damn it all......`
` ......Please, ......Ushiromiya Kyrie......`
` I know you will save your son from his plight......`
` .........Please, ......even after death, lend me power for his sake......"`
`However, Kyrie's body did not answer.`
`{n}......It was only natural that a corpse would remain silent.`
`No dead person existed that would answer Beato, now that she had lost the Endless Magic...`
`"It's pointless, pointless pointle~ssss.`
` Toying with the dead is a privilege only for witches.`
` For you, who is neither a witch nor even a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, no one exists who will lend a hand!!"`
`"You will be alone for all eternity!!`
` You have no witch or {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} allies, and no one will save you!!`
` If that frustrates you, why don't you cry forever?!`
` Why don't you apologize, say "I'm sorry I'm so useless" forever?!`
` Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"...............Sorry, ...Battler.........`
` ...I......couldn't help you...in any way......"`
`"..............................`
` ......No, you've done enough.`
` ......Thanks, Beato.`
` I won't waste your efforts..."`
`"I, I don't need consoling...!`
` Just how could you argue back with this pile of rubbish...?!!`
` Just how could you strike back with this rubbish I endured her sneering to scrape together...?!"`
`In front of Beato, who was still crawling on all fours and hitting the pile of objects Kyrie had left behind with her fist, Battler also crouched.`
`And, ......after patting her on the shoulder in thanks,`
` ......he moved that hand to the ground, picked up the cigarette butt, and held it up over his head.`
`".........What are you trying to say with that trash...?"`
`"Kyrie‐san doesn't smoke."`
`But Kyrie was even holding a lighter.`
`Certainly, she wasn't carrying a box of cigarettes itself,`
` but at a glance, it very naturally looked as though Kyrie had a smoking habit...`
`"...Dad smoked, but Kyrie‐san didn't.`
` ...But she did walk around with just a lighter to light Dad's cigarettes."`
`"Ha!`
` So what?`
` If the husband smoked, then even if the wife didn't, it isn't strange for her to have a cigarette on her."`
`"Maybe she just picked up her husband's irresponsibly tossed cigarette butt?`
` What are you trying to say?`
` What does this have to do with my magic?`
` Nothing at all!!!"`
`"I'll say more.`
` ...This is a different brand of cigarette than Dad smokes.`
` ......Sorry, Beato,`
` could you look in the pockets of Dad's body too?"`
`"..................M‐...mm.`
` ......This...?"`
`"......Checking the brand.`
` The brand is different from the cigarette butt.`
` ...The cigarette butt Kyrie had on her is not of the same brand as the cigarettes that Rudolf smokes."`
`"And so what?`
` Maybe Kyrie is just a good girl who likes things to be clean, so she couldn't leave a fallen cigarette butt alone and picked it up?`
` I wouldn't though!!"`
`"......Beato, sorry, but one more time please.`
` ...Uncle Hideyoshi's pockets.`
` .........In this family, only Dad and Uncle Hideyoshi smoke cigarettes."`
`"I‐......it's here...!`
` Is this it......?"`
`Beato found a cigarette box in Hideyoshi's pocket, took a single one out, and held it out.`
`"......Checking the brand.`
` We acknowledge that the cigarette butt is of the same brand that Hideyoshi smokes."`
`"L‐like I said, so what?!!`
` How can you break my magic because you found Hideyoshi's cigarette butt in Kyrie's pocket?!?!!!!"`
`"...............That's right.`
` This cigarette butt is our message from Kyrie‐san.`
` No, ......this cigarette butt itself is the reason that Kyrie‐san left the guesthouse."`
`"Beato, thank you.`
` ......If you hadn't found this, I would have given up here."`
`"............{f:5:Virgilia}!!`
` Reconstruct the situation!`
` The guesthouse after it came to light that Auntie Rosa and Maria had been killed on the second twilight!!"`
`"Understood."`
`"Reconstructing.`
` ......After Rosa and Maria's deaths, the remaining survivors rechecked all of the doors and windows in the mansion.`
` They constructed a barricade.`
` They rechecked that their defenses were solid."`
`"There's nothing suspicious about that at all.`
` What are you trying to say?`
` Why are you bringing back the second twilight when we're talking about the fourth twilight and after...?!"`
`"Dad carried a portable cigarette butt holder with him.`
` I can finally see why Kyrie‐san deliberately put that cigarette butt in her own pocket."`
`"............It was because that cigarette butt meant something.`
` That very cigarette butt was the message left by Kyrie‐san for us...!!"`
`"L‐let's hear it, then!!`
` How, using a single cigarette butt,`
` are you going to deny me?!!"`
`"......As you've just heard,`
` after the second twilight, an inspection was done for all the rooms in the guesthouse.`
` .........At that time, Kyrie‐san found something that shouldn't exist, in a place where it shouldn't be."`
`"S‐......something that shouldn't exist...?`
` ......What do you mean by that?"`
`"It's this.`
` This cigarette butt.`
` This had been set in the ashtray of the guest room where Uncle Hideyoshi had been."`
`"Huuuh?!?!`
` What's wrong with there being a cigarette butt in an ashtray?!!`
` Are you sure there isn't something wrong with your head?!"`
`"Aunt Eva hated smoking!!`
` There's no way that there would be a cigarette butt there when she was sick and sleeping!!!"`
`"However, there was a cigarette butt in the ashtray.`
` When she saw that, Kyrie‐san realized immediately.`
` ......Uncle Hideyoshi was lying.`
` She realized that Aunt Eva hadn't really been sleeping,`
` ...and that she had snuck out of the room!!"`
`"Repetition requested!!`
` "This cigarette butt was stubbed out in the ashtray of a room in which Uncle Hideyoshi {i:and} Aunt Eva were resting!""`
`".........I, ......I refuse...!"`
`"I've finally got it.........`
` Thank you, Beato."`
`"W‐`
`......was I...`
`...of some...`
`use...?"`
`"Yeah, you were!!`
` We'll tear it off, we'll tear the mask off of the fake witch!!!"`
`From that cigarette butt, Kyrie realized that Hideyoshi was creating an alibi for Eva's sake.`
`Hideyoshi had been tasked with watching over the room to create an alibi,`
` ...and during that time, he had been unable to withstand the tension and had smoked.`
`Then Kyrie had disclosed that to Rudolf.`
`{n}She disclosed that there was a good chance that Eva was the culprit, and Hideyoshi was an accomplice.`
`".........Next, Kyrie‐san proposed that they go to get food.`
` And then she asked Uncle Hideyoshi to lend a hand!!`
` This could only mean one thing."`
`"Kyrie‐san planned to isolate Uncle Hideyoshi and question him about the truth!!"`
`"‘Hempel's Raven’, valid.`
` Unless the witch side can counterattack this move, the existence of the magic which claims to have controlled Kyrie is denied."`
`"Wh‐what did you saaaaaaaaaaaayy?!?!`
` I, I deny it, anyway, I deny it...!!`
` It wasn't me, no, wait,`
` it wasn't Ushiromiya Eva, Eva was sleeping in the room!!!"`
`"Then try saying it.`
` You can't and I know it!`
` You can't say it this time either!!"`
`"Repetition requested!!`
` "At that time, Ushiromiya Eva did not take a step outside the room"!!"`
`"What the hell is thiiiiiiiis?!`
` {i:I'm} the one who was attacking, right?!`
` Why did I get on the side that's being attacked?!`
` When did offense and defense get reversed?!"`
`"I'm the one doing the questioning, you know?!`
` The witch, me, whyyyyyyyyyy!!!"`
`"I repeat!!!!`
` Repetition requested!!`
` "Ushiromiya Eva did not leave the room"!!`
` There's no way you can say it,`
` it's CHECKMAA{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}AATE!!"`
`"Does the witch side have a move in response?"`
`"......There cannot be one.`
` There is no truth that can be accepted from a false witch dressed up with truths and falsehoods."`
`"You aren't qualified to call yourself a real witch!!`
` You aren't the Golden Witch!`
` You are a human!"`
`"You are Ushiromiya Evaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`"OOOAAAOOOOOOOOOooooOOOOOOoooooohhhhhhhh!!"`
`The witch roared.`
` Her entire body was burned with a tremendous heat that denied her own witchcraft and existence, and she let out a roar like a dragon...`
`Her body flickered repeatedly,`
` flashing as Eva's figure and the witch's figure overlapped.`
`However, the roar drowned out that flicker, ...and made it return once more to the original form of the cruelhearted witch.`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ...kuhhihha{0}hha{0}ha{0}hahaha...`
` ...Alright.`
` ...If you want to call me Ushiromiya Eva, then go right ahead..."`
`"......I admit it, I really can't repulse all moves related to Ushiromiya Eva being the culprit.`
` ......I may have been dragged down from the position of Golden Witch,`
` ...and maybe I am now being called Ushiromiya Eva..."`
`"......But you know what? That by itself doesn't mean that witches and magic are denied!!`
` ...I'll teach you now..."`
`"I'll teach you that I am not Ushiromiya Eva, nor a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human},`
` ......but a real witch...!!!`
` Look and see this red truth!!"`
`The witch clapped her hands, and time advanced in the world of the game board.`
`As they called Jessica's name, Battler and Eva ran up to the parlor.`
`...They were searching for Jessica because they had gone to the servant room, found Nanjo's corpse, and didn't know where Jessica was.`
`".........So what's your point?`
` ......What are you trying to say?"`
`"Y‐.........you couldn't be...`
` ......Oh no......"`
`Beato went pale.`
` ...That made it clear that the move the evil witch was about to make was bad enough to have such an effect on Beato...`
`"This time,`
` ......I'll give you a fatal move that you won't be able to talk yourself out of.`
` ...No, I'll make this move against all {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s who support you.`
` Prepare yourself and listen...to my move."`
`"D‐......don't... That move is.........!"`
`"Beato, stay back...!!`
` I'll take it!`
` Bring it on, you fake witch!!"`
`"`
`{p:1:After Jessica was injured,}`
` {p:1:Eva was constantly under Battler's supervision}.`
` {p:1:Battler is neither the culprit nor an accomplice}.`
` {p:1:By this, we can establish a perfect alibi for Eva}."`
`"Wh‐......whaat...............?"`
`"I'll seal you,`
` and {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s as well,`
` ......in a red barrier of death that most certainly cannot be escaped from.`
` Farewell, lowly {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.`
` Sleep for all eternity in an absolute locked room of magic with no exits.`
` ......Now, prepare yourself.`
` For the red truth."`
`{p:1:There are no more than 18 humans on this island}.`
`Throw away your foolish thoughts of mysterious people hiding and committing crimes.`
`...But if I say it this way, you could also suspect animal culprits.`
` It would be unbearable to hear an irrational theory about how an orangutan trained to commit murder wouldn't count as a human.`
`So, I'll change it like this.`
`{p:1:No life forms other than humans have any connection to this game}.`
`So, with that covered,`
` next, I'll explain the situation for all 18 people who exist on this island.`
`{p:1:Kinzo is dead}.`
` {p:1:Krauss is dead}.`
`{p:1:Natsuhi is dead}.`
` {p:1:Hideyoshi is dead}.`
`{p:1:George is dead}.`
` {p:1:Rudolf is dead}.`
`{p:1:Kyrie is dead}.`
` {p:1:Rosa is dead}.`
`{p:1:Maria is dead}.`
` {p:1:Genji is dead}.`
`{p:1:Shannon is dead}.`
` {p:1:Kanon is dead}.`
`{p:1:Gohda is dead}.`
` {p:1:Kumasawa is dead}.`
`{p:1:Nanjo is dead}.`
`Those 15 are all dead.`
`And.`
`{p:1:Battler is alive}.`
`{p:1:Eva is alive}.`
`{p:1:Jessica is alive}.`
`That's everyone, all 18 of them!`
`"So you understand that, accordingly, when the last victim, Nanjo, died,`
` only three people, Battler, Eva, and Jessica, were alive, right?"`
`".........Wh‐......what did you say...?`
` ......Y‐......you bitch, ...you couldn't mean............"`
`"`
`{p:1:Eva was with you the whole time}.`
` {p:1:So committing a crime was impossible for her}.`
` {p:1:Of course, Battler‐kun isn't the culprit}.`
` {p:1:He wasn't forging an alibi for her, and he took the possibility that she was the culprit into account, watching over her actions carefully}."`
`"`
`{p:1:No chance existed for her to do anything suspicious}!`
` {p:1:In short, at the time of the crime, only Nanjo and Jessica were in the servant room}."`
`"......And I know what you're thinking.`
` Your next move will be this, right?`
` There's also a chance that Jessica is the culprit!`
` But too bad, I'll slice it up in red before you try!!"`
`"`
`{p:1:Ushiromiya Jessica has not committed murder}!`
` {p:1:She was not involved with Nanjo's murder}!!`
` {p:1:Her eyes were completely blocked}.`
` {p:1:It's impossible for her to carry out a murder like that}!"`
`"And here's an extra.`
` {p:1:Neither Eva nor Battler killed Nanjo, nor were they involved}!!"`
`"W‐wait a fucking second!!`
` That makes no goddamn sense!!`
` There are only three humans, then a murder occurs, ......and none of those three were involved? That's insane!!"`
`"I'll state it clearly.`
` {p:1:The culprit who killed Nanjo was neither Battler nor Eva nor Jessica}!!`
` In other words, it wasn't one of the survivors.`
` Get iiit?"`
`"No, umm, .........th‐that's right!`
` What about multiple personalities...?!`
` Just like you were originally another personality of Auntie Eva's,`
` ......let's say Jessica had another, witch‐like personality,`
` which took the name of "someone other than Jessica" and killed Doctor Nanjo...!!"`
`"Moron.`
` I've already said it in red.`
` {p:1:Jessica's eyes were completely blocked, and murder was impossible for her}!"`
`"No matter what kind of personality she was possessed by, murder could not be carried out with her body!`
` I wonder if you'll be satisfied if I say it this way?"`
`"{p:1:No actions caused by Jessica's body had any relation to or influence on the murder of Nanjo}!`
` {p:1:This also applies to Battler and Eva}.`
` In other words, no matter how much you try to struggle and interpret it,`
` {p:1:neither Jessica nor Battler nor Eva is the culprit who killed Nanjo}!"`
`"Y‐...you've got to be kidding me!!!`
` I mean, everyone else is dead for sure, right?!!"`
`"Then......all that's left......is the Doctor Nanjo suicide theory, right?!`
` And the trap theory!`
` The culprit was already dead, but a trap that they had already prepared went off..."`
`"{p:1:Nanjo's death was a homicide}.`
` ...{p:1:Of course, it was with a direct method of murder, not a trap}.`
` {p:1:They readied their weapon, and killed him with it directly from the front at point‐blank range}!`
` {p:1:The culprit appeared openly before Nanjo's eyes, and as they both looked at each other's faces, the culprit killed him}...!!"`
`"But wait!!`
` There are only three survivors!`
` You said in red that everyone else is dead!`
` You basically confirmed the life or death status of all 18 people.`
` Furthermore, the existence of a 19th person has already been denied in red...!!"`
`"In other words, no one can exist except the three survivors!!`
` And yet, a fourth person other than those three appeared before Doctor Nanjo!!`
` How can a person other than us appear and murder Doctor Nanjo when no 19th person exists?!?!"`
`"Insane!!`
` You're lying!!`
` You're lying with the red letters!!!"`
`"{p:1:The red only tells the truth}!!!`
` Isn't doubting that the same as betraying the honor of that witch who's behind you, shriveling up in fear of me and hiding behind your back?!"`
`"D‐.........damn it............!!!"`
`"I'll state it clearly,`
` right now.`
` ......The one who appeared in front of Nanjo was me.`
` A witch.`
` ......The Golden Witch, who can't be explained by the 18 humans!!"`
`"{f:5:V‐Virgilia}!`
` Ronove...!!`
` Isn't the situation contradicting itself?!`
` Is she really telling the truth with red?!"`
`"......Yes.`
` "Red truth", valid."`
`"............What an......elaborate and precise cornering......"`
`"H‐......how should I make a move against this...?`
` {f:5:Virgilia}...!`
` Isn't there any move......?!"`
`"..................I...cannot think of anything..."`
`"...And you, Ronove?!"`
`"........................`
` .........My apologies.`
` ......However, in these last thousand years,`
` ...I have never seen......such an elaborately beautiful game board layout."`
`"............Although it pains me to admit it,`
` ............it is beautiful.........`
` ......What a...`
`...beautiful red...`
`...checkmate..............."`
`The witch's master and the demon butler were both stunned, ...and a somehow rapturous expression rose to their faces...`
`.........Forget surrendering,`
` ...they were simply impressed at this perfect checkmate,`
` ...which could only be admired...`
`When people accept defeat from the bottom of their heart...`
`{n}it gives rise to neither regret nor humiliation.`
`{n}......Nothing is born except feelings of respect...`
`I.........no longer knew......what was what anymore.`
`There were absolutely no weak points in her red.`
`She had said in red that all 15 people had died.`
`{n}She had said in red that no people existed other than the 18.`
`In other words, no more than three people—me, Jessica, and Auntie Eva—existed.`
`And even though none of those three people were the culprit, Doctor Nanjo was killed.`
`And without a doubt, Doctor Nanjo's death was a homicide, murdered by "that person" openly from the front...!`
`And she claims "that person"......is a witch.........?!!`
`"The culprit that killed Nanjo was not an animal or anything of the sort.`
` That has already been dealt with in red, you know?`
` Remove everything other than humans from consideration entirely.`
` And no stuff like robots, either."`
`"{p:1:Absolutely no factors other than humans participate in this game board}!`
` Therefore, I can also say this:"`
`"{p:1:The one who killed Nanjo was definitely a human}!"`
`"{p:1:A human, with their feet on the ground, held up a weapon and killed with it}!`
` {p:1:Right before his eyes}!`
` However, the human may have been able to use magic.`
` ......Which means, it was a witch."`
`"......That is, in other words, me.`
` The Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!"`
`......Even as Battler...`
`ground his teeth...`
`......his knees hit the floor with a thunk.`
`His soul still refused to submit...`
`......However, ...his knees had already...`
`...started to accept submission......`
`"Kuhhihhihihihihihihihihi!`
` Oh, did you kneel...?"`
`"That's right, you're already starting to understand.`
` ......The Golden Witch does exist.`
` .........And that Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, is me...!!"`
`"Come on, praise me.`
` Now is the time to praise the resurrection of a true witch.`
` Now is the time to praise the resurrection of the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive......!!!"`
`"Daaamn iiiiiiiitt.........`
` ......I don't......understand......!`
` After...being so thoroughly immobilized by the red,`
` ......I don't......have a clue anymore......!"`
`"B‐......Battler......`
` D‐don't lose heart......`
` ...You and I...promised that we would fight each other again, did we not......?`
` Will you surrender here...?!`
` Will you disappear in a place like this before fighting with me again......?!"`
`"I don't want to break that promise......`
` ............But......I can't think of any move to deny her...!!"`
`"In the first place, ...this isn't even a proper problem!`
` Nothing exists outside the suspects, and all of the suspects are innocent!`
` I've been told that they're innocent in red!`
` And also that it was a real homicide, and that the culprit was human, and that they did appear in front of Doctor Nanjo's eyes and kill him!`
` I give up... There's nothing I can do...!!!"`
`"Please, Battler, don't give up, don't lose heart......!`
` ......If you stop thinking, it automatically becomes your loss.`
` ...I'm begging you, don't lose heart...`
` ......I'm also cheering you on, ......so don't lose......!"`
`"I can't think of anything anymore...!!`
` I end up thinking that she's just a witch anyway, and must have done it with magic, so just thinking is pointless...!"`
`"It's no good, my head hurts, my brain's tired...`
` I end up thinking that thinking's pointless, so I should just stop...!!"`
`"Battler, listen...`
` .........In the game of chess, both sides do all they can to make the other lose, so a single game takes a long period of time.`
` ......However, if one side throws away victory from the beginning, and voluntarily makes moves harmful to themselves, the game will end in the blink of an eye.`
` ......That is called a fool's mate."`
`A fool's mate is, simply put, a strange way of playing chess, with the mind to lose as soon as possible.`
`...Opening the area in front of your own king and inviting the opponent's queen in.`
`Chess, in which the average playing time for a single game may stretch for several hours, can be resolved in a scant four moves.`
`......In other words, if both sides try to win in a fight, they are compelled to take a painfully long period of time,`
` ...but if one side decides to lose, they can end the game all too easily, at any time...`
`"......When the human side stops thinking, it hands the problem before its eyes over to the witch,`
` and even an apple falling from a tree can be immediately resolved as the work of magic."`
`".........And it is the same way for the witch side.`
` ...Witches use the red truth.`
` ......If they use that to show that the true form of magic can be explained away using humans, they can immediately lose."`
`"............You don't have to tell me that...`
` ......You're telling me not to stop thinking, right...?`
` But,`
` .........how am I meant to counterattack her perfect bright‐red move...?`
` For me,`
` ......for humans,`
` .........it's no longer possible............"`
`".........Is it...`
`......impossible...?`
` ......Is it...`
`...impossible for you, Battler......?`
` ......Please... Don't lose heart........."`
`"..................Sorry.........`
` ...It's no longer...`
`......possible for me........."`
`Battler scratched at the floor, crying heavily.`
`......Beato watched that with a distressed face...`
`Then she stood up, and spoke to the witch.`
`"............I will make a move as a counterattack to yours."`
`"Huh?`
` How can you possibly cut up this perfect checkmate?"`
`"How can this checkmate, which is completely impossible for {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s to break,`
` possibly be broken by the likes of you?!"`
`".........{f:5:B‐Beatrice}, you couldn't be..."`
`"Mm.`
` ...What about a move that a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} cannot make.`
` ......I will counterattack you with a move I can use because I am a witch..."`
`"A move you can use because you are a witch......?`
` ......Wh‐...what are you planning to do...?"`
`"I will use the red...`
`to deny witches."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}...!!"`
`"M‐Milady...!!"`
`The master and the butler were both startled.`
`......I also immediately understood what it meant.`
`{n}To use the red that only witches could use.`
`{n}...{i:To use the red to deny witches}.`
`It was like using her own sword to slit her own throat.`
`"Wh‐............whaaat...?!`
` C‐......come on, what are you saying?`
` Deny witches with red...?`
` .........D‐...don't talk like an idiot.`
` If you do that, ...you won't get away unscathed either......!!"`
`".........You are not a witch.`
` And I am not a witch either.`
` ...The road to becoming a true witch is difficult, and I have much, much farther to go..."`
`".........Then that is convenient.`
` In this place now, witches did not exist from the beginning.`
` I will strip this deception away myself."`
`"You and I both are real, obvious witches!!`
` Being able to use red is itself proof that we are!"`
`"I don't know what the definition of a witch is to you,`
` but if you're mistakenly thinking that you alone will be able to get away unscathed, then you'd better—"`
`"I am making no such mistake.`
` I would accept it."`
`"Wh.........at did you say......?"`
`"I never managed to become a witch in the first place.`
` ......I have done nothing more than finally begin walking on the road to becoming a true witch."`
`"...If it is true that I am a witch as I stand,`
` ...then I am nothing more than a false witch who got addicted to power, like you."`
`"......Rather than existing in that shabby form,`
` I would have no regrets...`
`in erasing this form of mine along with you...!"`
`"A‐...are you insane?!?!`
` S‐stop it...!`
` I still want to be a witch! I don't wanna be {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}...!!"`
`".........Witch, please return to your seat.`
` Please, receive the human side's response from your seat."`
`"Wh‐what are you doing?!`
` L‐let go of me!!`
` Don't let that woman use red!!`
` Make her stop!!`
` Let gooooooooooooooooooo!!"`
`As the witch stood from her seat and tried to spring upon Beato, Ronove pressed down on both of her shoulders, forcing her back into her seat.`
`And, even after that, he didn't remove his hands from those shoulders.`
`Denying witches was the same thing as denying magic.`
`......That included demons such as Ronove.`
`However, instead of running away, Ronove chose to act as the facilitator for the game,`
` ...and to carry out that duty for his master's sake.`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` .........You have...no regrets, I hope."`
`"The same to you."`
`"......Sorry.`
` ......Even though you taught me a lot of fun magic and happy spells,`
` .........I couldn't use it well at all.`
` ............So I'll train from zero,`
` ...and start over again.`
` ...I am truly sorry.........that you had to get caught up in your stupid disciple's misconduct."`
`"......I had a good disciple in the very end.`
` ......Go, and do as you believe."`
`".........I, I don't have a clue what you guys are talking about..."`
`"...But I do understand one thing.`
` And I can say this...`
` ......Beato, I don't know what you're trying to do,`
` ...but whatever it is you're about to do, don't do it...!"`
`"You have no moves.`
` But I have one."`
`"......If we let this move escape us, she will be revived as a witch in the true sense, and this time, she will control this whole island.`
` ...All nightmares will be hers to do with as she pleases,`
` and this island will fall into the deepest hell of the evil witch's constant fantasies, for all eternity."`
`".........Can you permit that?`
` ...Is it alright for your dear relatives to be toyed with for all eternity in that witch's nightmare?"`
`"S‐still, ......{i:you} shouldn't have to sacrifice yourself...`
` Th‐this is a game between me and her.`
` There's no need for you to sacrifice yourself to make a move!`
` I, I'll think of something!`
` I'll definitely think of a miracle move...!!"`
`"So don't rush into it!!`
` Ooooooooooooooohhhh, damn it to hellllllllllll,`
` I'll definitely think of one, ......so don't rush into iiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`".........This game is cruel.`
` The time limit for your deliberation has already run out.`
` .........I am now the only one who can do it."`
`"...Worry not, Battler.`
` .........I'll defeat her.`
` ......I'll defeat that cruelhearted witch with my own hands..."`
`"W‐wait, Beato!!`
` Stop it, quit it!!`
` There's absolutely no need for you to sacrifice yourself!!"`
`"Last I remember, you were fighting to deny me.`
` ......What a strange person.`
` Hahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha."`
`"......Let that child do as she likes.`
` And please, see her through."`
`"B‐...but......"`
`"Battler.`
` ......There's only one thing I ask.`
` ......Would you...cover your ears?"`
`"My ears......?`
` Why...?"`
`".........In a few moments, I will deny witches in red.`
` I will slice up the game board that she has laid out with her red."`
`"......By doing that,`
` .........I will probably lose my form as a witch as well.`
` ......If you also hear the red truth I will tell, you will understand my true form."`
`".........Even if you alone cover your ears, the truth will not change at all.`
` ......However,`
` ...even so, I want you alone to cover your ears.`
` ..................I at least want to be a witch...in your eyes.`
` ......Please."`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` ...There is no problem on the witch side.`
` Please, your move."`
`"Let gooooooooooooooooooo!!`
` You won't get away unharmed either, you know?!"`
`"She's insane!!`
` She plans on dying and taking us with her!`
` Stop it, don't deny it!!"`
`"Stooooooppppppppppppp!!!"`
`"...How unsightly for a Golden Witch.`
` .........Now, are you ready?"`
`"...I will remove your checkmate in Battler's stead.`
` What happened on the chessboard where fifteen died, and only three remained?`
` ...I will now expose it in red.`
` With that red truth, ......I will impale and kill both fake witches!"`
`Beato turned around and smiled at Battler.`
`......Most likely, no one would believe that the witch who had gone to the limits of cruelty...`
`would try to leave a smile as the last expression she showed Battler.`
`And that smile signified her last wish, that she wanted him to cover his ears...`
`Denying witches in red......was the same as knowing her shabby form.`
`Battler put both of his hands against his ears...`
`......To protect her final...`
`honor as a witch, he put his hands against his ears, ...rejecting the truth.`
`And he howled.`
` So that not even a bit of what she was saying would slip into his ears.`
`After that...was a world where Battler could not hear anything.`
`{n}Beato was saying something with red.`
`Even the evil witch attempted to cover her ears at their bitter contents.`
`......That was...the red truth.`
` Words of power.`
`{n}......Words that denied her own existence.`
`Words that only witches could use—the only words capable of denying witches.`
`Beato talked.`
`{n}With the red truth, she sliced apart the bright‐red game board that the witch had released.`
`She explained difficult problems that could not be solved by humans, with moves that could only be solved by witches, and began cornering the witch.`
`The {i:truth} that Battler was not permitted to hear.`
`If Battler had broken his promise, and sneakily listened in...`
`{n}......in an instant, Battler would probably have been able to become the victor in his game with Beato.`
`......He would probably have understood all the riddles on the island, all of the magic and tricks, locked rooms, spells, curses, legends,`
` ...and the entire tale of anger and sadness.`
`However, ......Battler would only learn what that was when he reached the truth by himself.`
`Yes.`
` ...From the beginning, ......{f:5:Beatrice} had wished that Battler would reach that truth by himself.`
`It was something that shouldn't be reached by being told.`
`{n}It was a truth that Battler would have to drag himself to with his own power.`
`A brilliant light gathered with Beato and the evil witch at the center, and grew gradually stronger...`
`It was...the power of truth.`
`.........A heat and brilliance like the sun...`
`shone on all of the falsehoods that hid in the darkness, trying to deceive, ...and burnt them to nothing.`
`"GWOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAaaaAAaaAAAaaaahhhh!!`
` How?!`
` How can you die?!`
` How can you throw away your life...when you have such incredible power?!`
` You hold the power to control gold, magic, and everything else at will—`
`how can you so readily throw that away?!"`
`"......Learn that even with a mountain of gold,`
` even with magic to split the sea,`
` there are some things you can never obtain.`
` .........Come, show yourself.`
` Show your true form, ......Ushiromiya Eva!!!"`
`When the sun exploded and blew everything away...`
`{n}......Eva could be seen there, holding a gun.`
`"Y‐.........you are the culprit...`
` Aunt Eva......!!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*......ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!`
` Took you long enough to notice, Battler‐{i:kun}!!"`
`Without any hesitation or mercy, Eva raised the gun and pulled the trigger.`
`...An explosion resounded, and Battler fell to the floor, his heart shot through.`
`After going into convulsions for a short time,`
` ...with blood dripping from his mouth,`
` ...Battler died...`
`But in his last moments, ...he understood without a doubt that she was a murderer.`
` And not just for killing him...`
`.........There are several murders where I don't have a clue how they were carried out.`
`However, ......while my ears were covered,`
` ......Beato exposed all of them with the red, blasting away all magic.`
`...In other words, .........even though I didn't understand it,`
` ......hadn't that been nothing more or less than proof that all magic can be explained with humans?`
`.........Beato made me cover my ears.`
`{n}...So I myself don't know the whole truth.`
`...However, .........from the fact that she managed to deny it in red,`
` I learned one fact which is extremely unfair for us......namely, "it is possible to deny all magic".`
`So, in other words, .....................`
`......No,`
` ......I must not think of that.`
`.........If I do, ...then the time I covered my ears would be made pointless.`
`If I'm going to regret, I can only regret my own actions.`
` ...If, at that time, I had thought of some turnabout move to counter the witch's final play,`
` there would have been no need for Beato to sacrifice herself.`
`I......brought about this conclusion......because I was worthless...`
