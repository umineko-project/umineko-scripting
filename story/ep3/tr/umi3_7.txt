`Gohda was doing the nighttime rounds.`
`There had never been anything on Rokkenjima outside the Ushiromiya family.`
`{n}So checking that the doors and windows were all closed had no real purpose.`
`However, ever since Natsuhi had scolded them saying that this was careless, the nighttime rounds had become part of the servants' daily routine.`
`......The reason that Natsuhi had ordered this was the occasional disturbances of the witch.`
`Everyone who visited this island knew about the legend of {f:5:Beatrice}, the witch of the forest.`
` This had become established as this island's characteristic ghost story.`
`Because of that, it was only natural that some people would occasionally say that, when they thought they were alone in the mansion,`
` ...they had heard strange sounds, or seen the shadow of a person.`
`However, when that had created a little too big of a disturbance and reached Natsuhi's ears,`
` she had made a fuss, thinking that some suspicious person might have been coming in and out.`
`Apparently, it was said that she had roused all of the servants and had them check throughout the mansion.`
`Because all of this uproar over the witch had happened before Gohda had come,`
` he had only heard about it from the more senior servants.`
`Ghost stories like that could be found in any workplace.`
` Even at the hotel Gohda had once worked at, and at the restaurant,`
` there was never a shortage of those types of story.`
`So when he heard that story on this island,`
` he smiled bitterly, thinking "ah, so they have that kind of thing here after all".`
`He smiled bitterly, but he thought when in Rome, do as the Romans do, and had not slighted that.`
`Gohda went along with it on the outside, but in his heart he thought it was a childish trick.`
` ......At first.`
`"............This certainly is eerie.`
` I see, I understand why the servants got in an uproar over this in the past."`
`He could understand that if someone, doing the rounds on an eerie night like this,`
` saw a lace curtain waving in the breeze from a window which hadn't been closed,`
` they might be tempted to believe they had seen a ghost.`
`"So there's a curse if you make fun of the witch of the portrait, huh.`
` ......Seems like there were servants who got hurt really bad and quit, too.`
` ...I'd hate to be injured.`
` I'm already this old.`
` Doubt I'll ever be blessed with a workplace this hospitable again...`
` Aaah.`
` Great witch of the portrait.`
` I'm really gonna work hard here, so please go easy on me."`
`Gohda prayed to the portrait, his hands together, as though he was at a Shinto shrine...`
`At that time, ...he thought he heard a sound.`
`The kitchen?`
` Was that the sound of something metal falling on the floor?`
`Surely a mouse or a cockroach hadn't come out, and knocked over some of the dishes...`
` No, no, how could that be.`
` It was routinely and thoroughly cleaned!`
`Gohda thought that in any case he had better check what that noise had been, and entered the kitchen.`
`He turned on the kitchen light.`
`{n}......When he did, he heard a strange sound.`
`Clankclankclankclankclankclank.`
`......To a cook like Gohda, that sound seemed like the lid on the pressure cooker or something was shaking.`
`Of course, it couldn't be in use when no one was in the kitchen.`
`{n}If someone {i:had} been using the gas, what a dangerous thing to do, to just walk away from it.`
`...Just in case, Gohda decided to inspect the area around the gas range...`
`"...............What is this...?"`
`When he did, in the corner by the gas range,`
` ...the pressure cooker really had been placed there, just as he had thought.`
`But the flame wasn't on.`
`{n}...And yet, the lid was clanking...`
`Was something fermenting and leaking gas?`
`{n}...How could that be?`
` ......Then was there a mouse or something inside?`
`{n}...How could there be, ridiculous...`
`In front of people, Gohda acted as though he had a bold personality fitting for his build,`
` ......but he actually had an unexpectedly timid side to him.`
`He was terrified to find out what might be inside, and he couldn't check it carelessly...`
`In his cowardice, ...he grabbed a nearby wooden pestle,`
` and with a {i:clunk!},`
` he tapped it a little strongly against the side of the pressure cooker.`
`When he did, the clanking sound suddenly stopped.`
`...He should have been relieved now that it had stopped,`
` ...but the fact that it had stopped when he had hit it was even more eerie, and made him even more suspicious about what was inside...`
`"............nn, ...*gulp*.`
` .........Strange phenomena do not exist in this world, no sirree.`
` Yes, there's no such thing as witches, or magic, things like that can't possibly exist.`
` All phenomena can be explained with science.`
` ......As though monsters and witches could exist...!"`
`He repeated that many times, trying to build up his own confidence.`
` ...It was quite comical how he looked completely different from what he was saying.`
`"Who would believe in a witch, who would believe in magic or curses...`
` ......Come on,`
` ......show me what you really are...!`
` Take that!"`
`......He removed the lid of the pressure cooker.`
`And lying exposed there...`
`was the sparkling clean silver bottom of the pot.`
`......There was absolutely nothing frightening like he had imagined.`
`"...............Whew.`
` ...Hahahaha, well, of course.`
` ...There's no way there could have been anything inside."`
`By now, Gohda realized that he had been a coward.`
`......So while he still had some doubts about what had caused the lid to make that sound,`
` ...he explained it away abstractly as some quirk of positioning or something, and decided not to worry about it too much.`
`Then he took the lid he had grabbed, ......and softly set it back down where it had been.`
`......It's alright, there won't be a sound.`
` ......Obviously.`
`{n}As if witches or magic could exist...!`
`Clank.`
` Clankclankclankclank.`
`"...............Huh...?"`
`Clank{0}clank{0}clank{0}clank{0}clank{0}clank{0}clank{0}clank.`
`CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK!`
`"Hii, ......HIIIiiiIIIIii!!"`
`All of the pots and utensils in the kitchen started clanking at once.`
`And it grew stronger still, until finally, it became so strong that the lid to one of the pots fell off...!`
`And, ......from inside that pot, .........a slender white arm slowly streeeetched out.`
`The lid fell off another pot, and another hand slowly streeeetched out,`
` and anotherrrr,`
` and anotherrrr...`
`"Hiiiiiiiii!!!`
` Witches aren't, witches can't be reeeeeal!!`
` I'll never believe iiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`When the number of arms grew to seven, a loud, shrill laughter split the air.`
`"What a letdown!`
` It's a reeeeal letdown that a person who can make such delicious food is such a lightweight!!"`
`"If you don't need him, I'll take him, he's all mine!!"`
`"Wait, I said nooooooooooo!!`
` I'm gonna take him!!"`
`"Huh?!`
` Wha, whaa?!?!`
` HYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!"`
`""""Kyahahahahahahaha!!!""""`
`Come on, let's search, there's only one more.`
`{n}That old hag!`
` Where is she?`
`{n}Not the mansion, maybe the guesthouse?`
`Kuhihihihi, you snooze you lose, right, you snooze you lose, right?!`
`Come on, search search, find her find her...!`
`Don't get noticed by the relatives in the dining hall?`
`Don't get noticed by the kids in the guesthouse?`
`Search in silence, kill in silence!`
`{n}After all, it's still just the first twilight!`
`She isn't in the guesthouse.`
`{n}But she wasn't in the mansion either?`
`Hey hey, I found her, I found her, she's in the rose garden.`
`{n}Why's she standing around there without an umbrella?`
`She's given herself up, all mine all mine all miiine!`
`{n}You slowpokes can just sit there and watch!`
`I told you, nooooooo, this one's miiiiiiiiiiiiine!!`
`Come on, if we take any longer we'll be scolded by {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama!`
` Let's take care of it all at once!`
`"......................................."`
`Come on, found her, surrounded her!`
` Come on, let's get along and do it all at once, okay?!`
` Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiie!!!`
`".........Eeeh...?`
` .........Huh?"`
`"Wh‐`
`......what is...`
`...this..."`
`"............Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` What naughty girls.`
` ...Could you be friends of that child...?"`
`"...What is with this............o‐old hag...?!"`
`"There's got to be some mistake!!`
` One more time!!"`
`"......Why can she defend against us?!"`
`"Move aside!`
` One more time!!!"`
`"............No matter how often you try, it's useless.`
` This person...is good."`
`"...............I am waiting for that child.`
` Would you mind calling for her?"`
`"D‐do you think we'd be apprenticed to you like that?!"`
`"There's no need."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...!"`
`"............It was sufficient for even myself to manifest.`
` ...I was sure that you would awaken."`
`"Ronove.`
` It has been a long time.`
` ......Yes, it truly has been a long time."`
`"This woman, she didn't use "sama" for his name......!"`
`"..................And...`
`it has been a long time for us also.`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"Sh‐she's not even using "sama" for {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama..."`
`"Enough.`
` Do you know who this person is?`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice} was originally this person's name.`
` I merely inherited that name from her.`
` ......This person is my master.`
` The Predecessor Lady {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"The Predecessor...`
`...Lady {f:5:Beatrice}......"`
`Gold butterflies appeared in ones and twos from the garden of roses and began to gather around Kumasawa...`
`And after becoming a golden radiance and enveloping her, they burst and disappeared—and Kumasawa's form was no longer there.`
`...Instead, there was another Golden Witch, .........the one who had, in the past, explained to {f:5:Beatrice} the path of an Endless Witch,`
` the only person {f:5:Beatrice} had called Master in her entire life.`
`Her hair was long, beautiful, and vividly youthful,`
` and her figure in that elegant dress was unrecognizable as an old lady...`
`No, this looked like a completely different person than Kumasawa.`
`".........Well, well, Master.`
` I never even dreamed the day would come that we would meet each other again."`
`"Yes, me too.`
` ...Certainly, I never even dreamed that my sleep would be disturbed."`
`"Such a troublesome time for you to awaken.`
` ......If you remained sleeping as usual, the first twilight could be finished without much trouble."`
`"...Or should I welcome you?`
` ............I was just a little bored."`
`"......Just as usual, it seems you are toying with sinless people in a vulgar game.`
` ......I believe I have taught you many times that the power of the Endless Witch must not be used to cause people trouble."`
`"Don't say that, Master.`
` Isn't boredom our natural enemy?`
` This is just a little spice to escape from that."`
`".........Tch.`
` The more the corrosion advances, the stronger my power becomes, and the easier it becomes to call my minions.`
` ...But who would have thought it would release the seal on you, Master, at the same time..."`
`"It was because I predicted that,`
` that I slept very close to you like this.`
` ......As I prayed in my sleep that I would not be woken again.`
` ...Being reunited with you like this is a very sad thing for me."`
`"..................You're as cunning as always, Master...`
` *cackle*..."`
`"Ronove.`
` Have the furniture children step back.`
` Furniture merely serves its master.`
` The master is responsible for all of her crimes."`
`".........Certainly.`
` Madam {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"I have already surrendered that name to this child.`
` ......Come now, step back.`
` Furniture girls.`
` ......For those who do not listen the first time, I say it a second.`
` However, I do not speak it a third..."`
`"......Step back, Seven Sisters of Purgatory.`
` If you get involved, you will be turned to dust..."`
`"B‐......back, everyone..."`
`Ronove and the Seven Sisters of Purgatory retreated.`
`After that, there was the {f:5:Beatrice} whose bold expression didn't falter,`
` and the master {f:5:Beatrice}, who had given up that name, and wore a composed smile...`
`"Well then.`
` ......Master.`
` What tea shall I prepare for our long awaited reunion?"`
`"Let's see.`
` This reunion was longer in coming than the visit of a comet.`
` I will accept your hospitality.`
` .........If there appear to be any issues, then my name and the title of Endless Witch,`
` ......I will have them returned, understand?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` So there's even a license renewal policy for the title of Endless Witch?"`
`"......As you say, Master.`
` See how splendid your disciple has become,`
` and see how far she has surpassed what you were long ago...!"`
`It looked like sparks exploded in the air between the two {f:5:Beatrice}s.`
`Just by glaring at each other, they purged all spirits from that space.`
`...As they watched, the Seven Sisters shivered.`
` ...Because if they had retreated just three steps less than they had, they would already have been turned to dust by now.`
`"So, come.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...Surrendering my name to you is the only regret I have in my life.`
` I will now correct that error with my own hands!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...`
` ...Tut tut tut.`
` ......That's wrong, Masterrr.`
` My only error...`
`was becoming your disciple to learn this trifling level of power, got thaaaat?"`
`"You call this magic?`
` You call this being an Endless Witch?`
` ......The power to notice, that's all it waaas!`
` And you made suuuch a big deal of it.`
` Your time is long past, Masteee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeer!!"`
`".........I,`
` ......I, I don't have a clue what's going on anymore......!`
` What in the world is happening right in front of my eyes...!"`
`"......Poor thing.`
` It seems my disciple is causing you trouble.`
` I apologize."`
`"Y‐...you... Who are you?`
` Why did Kumasawa baa‐chan turn into an attractive lady like this?!`
` I mean, who are you?!`
` I don't get it?!`
` What kind of special effects are these?!`
` My head feels like it's gonna explode!!"`
`"I am the witch master of that child.`
` My old name was {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` When she succeeded me, I gave her that name, so I do not have a name."`
`"You already said it, but your disciple's being a real pain to me!`
` Please, take responsibility and do something!`
` No, wait!!"`
`"I don't believe in stuff like this!!`
` As if witches and magic are real!!`
` I won't accept this messed‐up battle!`
` Damn it all to hell, what am I supposed to believe?!!"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` Just like you, hospitality with a very quick temper."`
`"...*cackle*cackle*.`
` I'd expect nothing less from you, Master.`
` It looks like this level of magic is so insignificant to you, you can't even be bothered to open your eyes...!"`
`"Looks like it'll be impossible unless I'm prepared to wreck the whole island, riiiiiight?`
` Come, arise, Shoulder War Towers!!"`
`In response to {f:5:Beatrice}'s summons, a terrific earth tremor split the rose garden.`
`And on either side of her shoulders, two massive War Towers sprouted and stabbed into the heavens.`
` They stretched 100 {c:86Ef9C:merute} tall, and each one had over 360 ports.`
`They were War Towers of the gods' army corps, which had not allowed the heroes of antiquity to invade their precincts, even as they banded together.`
`As {f:5:Beatrice} elegantly floated in the gap between the massive two‐headed towers, she looked down on her master, sneering with an absolute superiority.`
`With the two massive towers lined up behind her shoulders, the witch looked very small,`
` like a butterfly dancing between large trees.`
`"Hihhyahhyahhyaaaaaa!!`
` Don't think you can dodge it by turning into butterflies, alright?`
` The density of the twin towers' barrage wouldn't just make you a pinned bug collection, it'd make you a madly stabbed pincushion, get it...?"`
`The towers' more than 720 ports opened, and godly soldiers readied their multi‐shot ballistas.`
`"Does that conclude your turn?"`
`"Heh, {i:those} are your last words?!!`
` OPEN FIII{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}IIIRE!!!"`
`Ballista shots numbering easily over a thousand were all fired at once, drawing a beautiful geometric curtain of death.`
`The boorish sound performed by those bowstrings was probably even deeper than the sound of Death swinging his scythe.`
`"Come, arise, Fallen Tower.`
` Split the single language, and make known the sin."`
`The sky was stained an incandescent red, and from between the clouds, a blazing, massive tower fell upside down.`
`That massive falling tower and its rubble...`
`swallowed the thousands of ballista shots, so that not one of them could approach the body of the witch who had summoned it.`
`Yes, none can approach the mysteries of heaven.`
`{n}That was the truth of the Fallen Tower.`
`"As I would expect from you, Master!`
` If you do something, you always do it big!!`
` Kuhhuhu{0}hu{0}huhya{0}hyahya!!"`
`"My turn isn't over.`
` Come, arise, Sons of Ivaldi.`
` Bestow upon me a worthy spear!"`
`As the massive crimson tower that had fallen made a mighty gold‐colored explosion,`
` from inside those flames, a spear showed itself, of such massive proportions that you had to look up to see all of it, much like a tower.`
`...It was too large for even a giant's hand.`
`It was a divinely beautiful spear of the gods, so massive that it gave the illusion that the tower which had fallen had turned into a spear of the same size.`
` A spear of certain victory that no one could escape.`
`"It looks like your twin towers are useless.`
` How foolish that you blocked off your means of escape on both sides.`
` You can't defend against even a single spear!"`
`When she snapped her fingers in command,`
` the massive tower‐like spear shot at {f:5:Beatrice} like a lightning bolt.`
`As the Golden Witch danced in the gap between the towers like a butterfly,`
` it sliced straight through the air like a flash of lightning,`
` aiming right for the very middle of the absolute center of her heart, with the most ultimate and extreme precision.`
`"Hah!!`
` So, you use Gungnir in a place like this!!`
` You really are incredible, Masteeeerrrrr!!"`
`"Explode, useless towers!`
` Arise, Giant Soldier Battle Line.`
` Fully block that divine spear with your shields and chests!!"`
`The Shoulder War Towers exploded in gold.`
`{n}They became several billion gold butterflies.`
`Those butterflies took the shape of seven massive armored soldiers.`
`Each stretched a full 50 merute into the sky,`
` and they lined up in front of {f:5:Beatrice}, protecting their master and holding massive shields which towered like windmills.`
`Their massive size was evocative of a mountain range.`
` The witch hiding behind them was like a small moon hiding behind the mountains.`
`Once in the past, when the massive shields these giants held had been readied by the whole giants' regiment,`
` they had protected King Wilhelm's castle not only from arrows, but from the wind and the rain,`
` and when they had faced upwards and held their shields to the heavens, not a single raindrop had gotten through.`
`"Foolish.`
` How pitiful is the witch who has forgotten her respect for the divine.`
` Did you think that giants could defend against a spear of the gods?!"`
`"......Indeed.`
` No matter how much human metal you are armed with, you cannot block a spear of the gods.`
` A wonderful epaulette mate by Madam."`
`"No way?!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama!!"`
`"Of course I haven't forgotten, Master!`
` Come, arise, Hephaestus and his disciples.`
` Bestow upon me a worthy shieeeld!!"`
`A golden whirlwind arose at the feet of the Giant Soldiers.`
`{n}It was a group of countless butterflies.`
`...They attached themselves to the massive shields like gold leaf, sparkling like they were a gold mirror.`
`That was the absolute defensive wall that the King of the Gods gave to the goddess.`
`{n}The Aegis Shield.`
`When the holy spear, which left a dignified tail behind it like a comet, crashed into the mountain range of that gold shield,`
` there was a terrible thunderous roar.`
` It was the creaking of the pillars that held up the heavens.`
`The Divine Spear spun around and around, sent flying in the direction the sun sets.`
`"Impossible...`
` Sh‐she defended against the Divine Spear...!!"`
`"No, that is not correct.`
` The holy spear avoided the impact.`
` It is the law of the gods that an absolute spear and an absolute shield must not fight each other.`
` Although in the end, it means the same thing as defending against it."`
`"..................Churlish fighting appears to be the only area in which your skills have improved."`
`"Or rather, it seems that you are still as bad as ever at this kind of game, Master.`
` It's my turn to strike back.`
` I shall follow the code and counter a spear with a spear."`
`The Giant Soldier Battle Line, which had fully blocked the Divine Spear, released their holy gold shields.`
`The shields fell to the earth, making the ground shake.`
`And then another gold whirlwind arose,`
` and the seven gold shields changed their form into seven massive spears of lightning lying on the ground.`
`In unison, each of the giants lifted a leg high, and firmly stomped on the tips of the handles.`
`As the earth shook with a thunderous sound, the seven lightning spears spun beautifully and flew up above the Giant Soldiers' heads.`
`...They covered everywhere in a spray of gold as they began to fall before the giants.`
`Each of the giants squared off, and with the force of their whole body, they kicked and smashed them into pieces.`
`Those broken pieces numbered exactly 30 each, and became lightning spears of exactly the same size as the original,`
` which made 210 for all 7 of them; and all of those burst at once,`
` each splitting into 30 thorns, so that there were 6,300.`
`They became a thundercloud barrage, drawing out a beautiful geometric pattern,`
` and then each of those changed into three bolts of lightning, so that 18,900 thunderbolts shot at the Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`"It's oveeeeer!!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐samaaa!!"`
`"I would expect nothing less.`
` ......From Madam."`
`Certainly, a bundle of almost 20,000 thunderbolts should have reduced the master's body to dust.`
` But there was no impact.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} knew immediately that she had been fooled.`
`At that moment, from the direction the sun was supposed to set, she felt an impossible ray of sunlight.`
`A brilliant ray of light shone on her profile.`
`It was the figure of the master, holding aloft the spear of the gods that had supposedly been repelled a short while ago.`
`{n}...She bore a brilliant radiance like the sun on her back, and made it shine on the incarnation of darkness.`
`...{f:5:Beatrice}, watching from there,`
` was trapped like a mouse in a cage, cornered in a dead‐end formed by the Giant Soldier Battle Line.`
`By now, the Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice} had seized a position directly alongside the Giant Soldier Battle Line.`
`"Now we are done playing, {f:5:Beatrice}...!"`
`".........H‐have I...`
`exposed my flaaaaank......?!"`
`Her bold expression hadn't faltered once before now, but now it twisted for the first time.`
`And faster than {f:5:Beatrice} could click her tongue, the Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice} released the holy spear.`
`In mid‐air, it sprung up into the air once more, and changed its form once again.`
`"Come, arise, Dvergar brothers.`
` Bestow upon me the giant‐smashing Iron Hammer of Heaven!"`
`"Giant Soldiers, protect me!!!`
` What are you doing, you slowpokes!!!"`
`By now it was no longer a spear, but the whirlwind of a massive hammer that raised a sound like a windstorm as it flew through the air.`
`It was the legendary hammer that had shaken the King of the Frost Giants.`
`{n}So the Giant Soldiers couldn't escape from that fear.`
`So no matter how much their master ordered them, they couldn't block the path of that hammer.`
`"Back rank mate!`
` Rest in peace."`
`"...Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit.........!!!"`
`Before the whirlwind of this massive chunk of metal, {f:5:Beatrice} was nothing more than a mere speck.`
`The instant the whirlwind started to suck {f:5:Beatrice} in, {f:5:Beatrice}'s form turned into a massive War Tower.`
`The Iron Hammer smashed the War Tower, scattered tremendous amounts of rubble, but it did not reach she who had escaped behind it.`
`Furthermore, when the smoke started to settle, the War Tower had sucked in the massive Iron Hammer without crumbling, and blocked the way.`
`Even the giant‐smashing Iron Hammer couldn't break through the final tower protecting the witch.`
`However, this War Tower was in fact the witch's last trump card.`
`{n}It was a War Tower for dodging that could only save her from danger once.`
`But this tower was impregnable.`
` No weapon could break through it.`
`Just then, the moon disappeared.`
` As {f:5:Beatrice} hid in the shadows of the Giant Soldier Battle Line and the War Tower, she looked up at the sky.`
`When she did, inside the moon was the figure of a massive horse ridden by the god of war and death.`
`The Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice} rode the horse with him.`
`His cloak had blocked the moon and swallowed it in an eerie shadow.`
`{n}And the spear of the gods was in his hand once more...`
`It was, in other words, a godly knight who had jumped over the ramparts formed by the Giant Soldiers and the War Tower, attacking from the heavens.`
`"......*cackle*...`
` You got meee..."`
`"Smothered mate.`
` It was fun, {f:5:Beatrice}!"`
`"Uuuoooooo{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}oooo!!!"`
`The struggle to the death between the two witches with the same name...was resolved.`
`The spear that had been launched from the heavens pierced the ground.`
`The Giant Soldier Battle Line and the War Tower split up into countless gold butterflies, shrouding the area in a golden storm.`
`Then, the sound of thunder.`
` ......And the sound of the falling rain and wind.`
`Suddenly, that place was the empty rose garden once more.`
`{n}...The butler and the rest were watching the two witches confronting each other.`
`.........But only {f:5:Beatrice} was different.`
`She had been pierced straight through by the spear, from the base of her neck and her right shoulder, to her left buttock,`
` unable to even reach the ground with her feet,`
` ...horribly exposed like a pitiful pinned butterfly, tormented by the wind and rain...`
`".........B‐{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama..."`
`".....................`
` Truly...`
`she is a fearsome person."`
`"It is decided.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......Ku,`
` ......hihihihi,`
` ......ouch...h..."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} wore a bitter smile of false courage,`
` but a strand of blood dangled from her mouth, making her look even more pitiful.`
`"The title and power of the Endless Witch.`
` You will now return them to me along with the name {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...You are too immature to be called the Endless Witch."`
`"............Stop...`
` Forgive me, Master...`
` I was just fooling around, okay......?"`
`"I will take my name back from you.`
` I will return you to your original form.`
` Relinquish this power which is beyond you, and live a life suitable for yourself."`
`".........Come, try to remember.`
` What form did you have?"`
`The Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice} began to recite the words of power.`
`{n}When she did, small gold butterflies gathered around the skewered {f:5:Beatrice}, and began to swarm about her.`
`Like butterflies sucking the nectar out of flowers...`
`{n}...they began to suck the magical power out of {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`And it seemed that it caused her intense pain.`
`{n}A cry of agony escaped from {f:5:Beatrice}'s mouth.`
`She no longer had any power to resist it...`
`"Come, try closing your eyes.`
` Try to remember.`
` What form did you have?"`
`".........Come, {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` Repeat it with me.`
` Let us chant together.`
` Then it will be over in no time.`
` Let us end your pain as fast as possible."`
`"...Kuhihihi,`
` ......ha,`
` ...haha...`
` ......You're right...`
` How long has it been...`
`......since I chanted with you, Master......"`
`"Now, together.`
` .........Come, try to remember.`
` What form did you have?"`
`"......Come, try to remember.`
` What form did you have...?"`
`When the two of them began to recite the same chant,`
` more and more gold butterflies danced around, swarming around {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`".........It's alright, Milady.`
` You will lose the fact that you are my disciple,`
` but that will not change the fact that you are the lady I serve."`
`"...After that, I shall read a book for you again.`
` I shall bake you apple pies again.`
` Just like it was long ago.`
` ......Come, try to remember."`
`"......Hahahahahaha...`
` Yes, try to remember.`
` ...Are you finally starting to remember...?`
` ............Well, Master.`
` Did you remember...`
`...that thing behind yooou...?"`
`"...What is this...?`
` .................................This is..."`
`When the Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice} looked behind her,`
` ............there was a creepy hedgehog crouching there.`
`No.`
` ...It was...`
`...herself.`
`There was another Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice}, whose whole body was packed with ballista shots,`
` ......lying there like a pincushion doll...`
`"......Come, try to remember.`
` What form did you have?`
` ......No, I suppose that's wrong."`
`"......Come, try to remember.`
` How were you killed?`
` ......Kuhihihii, kuhya{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}hhaa{0}a{0}a{0}aaahh!!"`
`The Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice} was shocked.`
`...Instantly, her form began to grow faint...`
`"This......`
` ......When...did you............"`
`"In the beginning, I did not summon Shoulder Towers.`
` They were Quadruplet Towers.`
` Master, you nonchalantly stepped across the Seventh Rank Rook boundary of death created by the two hidden towers,`
` which were lurking in the distance on either side of you."`
`"......It was bad manners for me to say "check" so late.`
` Let me openly apologize.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The battle had been decided at the very beginning.`
` It had been over since the time the Predecessor had leaned forward, readying her holy spear to attack {f:5:Beatrice}, who had been wedged between her Shoulder Towers.`
`...The hidden towers lurking on either side had bathed her in a windstorm of ballista shots from 720 ports on both sides,`
` pinning and killing her.`
`However, {f:5:Beatrice} hadn't wanted it to be resolved with that.`
`{n}She had wanted to make her master take her next move, and had continued acting as though the game was still on.`
`She had immediately revived her with the Endless power,`
` ...and had made her continue the game as though nothing had happened...`
`Then the Predecessor slowly remembered that she had already been killed,`
` ......and began to completely erase her form.`
`When she did, the spear which had pierced {f:5:Beatrice} also erased itself.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} finally fell and landed on her feet.`
`{n}...There wasn't even a trace of a scar.`
`".........It was fun,`
` Master.`
` If you want to play again, I'll revive you any time.`
` And once we've had some fun, I'll make you remember that you were a corpse again."`
`"Okay?`
` I'm fully obeying what you taught me, you know...?`
` Didn't you say to always put a toy back in its box when you are done playing with it?`
` *cackle*cackle*, hahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"......Was it...an easy victory?"`
`"You fool, it was a difficult victory!!`
` ............If I hadn't tricked her with the Quadruplet Towers, I would have been the one to die!`
` ......As I would expect from my master.`
` .........But now I may feel proud."`
`"...Now, I have completely surpassed my master.`
` Ronove.`
` Make Master's remains a little better.`
` ......I haven't lost my respect for her that much."`
`"Certainly.`
` Tonight's first twilight became a little too riotous.`
` It will require some cleaning up.`
` It shall be handled immediately.`
` Goats, it is time to clean up."`
`When Ronove snapped his fingers, blazing, sparkling eyes began to blink open in the shadows and darkness,`
` becoming goat‐headed attendants, which appeared one after another, slowly out of the black.`
`One by one, they lined up behind Ronove's back, wordlessly standing at attention.`
`"What shall be done about the six bodies this time?`
` Another locked‐room format?"`
`"......I am not in a mood to think now.`
` I will leave it to you.`
` ...An extraordinary locked room to torment Battler, if you would."`
`"Certainly.`
` It shall be extraordinary."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*, hahhhahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!`
` Allllright, where is Battler?`
` Battleeeeer, did you watch my big momeeeeeeeeent??"`
`".........Damn iiiiiiiiit...`
` After being shown that screwed up magical storm, what can I deny?!"`
`"Do witches exist, I ask?!`
` After all those kabooms and kabangs,`
` after being shown all that tremendous fantasy, what can I deny now?!!`
` I don't get it anymore!`
` It was like that last time too, but how can I deny that awesome, wonderful magical battle?!"`
`"I knoo~w, rii~ght?!`
` After watching this, you can't talk your way out of it anymore, caaaan youuuuu???`
` Alright, Battler, let me hear some ridiculous reasoning, kuhhi{0}hhyah{0}hyahhya!`
` Uhhiehhiehhyaaahhh!!"`
`"Milady, your laugh is undignified."`
`"Oh, my apologies.`
` But I am not to blame."`
`"After all, when Battler tightly closes his eyes, grinds his teeth and shows me that ever‐so‐bitter expression,`
` it just automatically slips out of my mouth, you seeee...`
` Kuhhihihhyahhyahaah!!"`
`"Come, Battler‐sama.`
` Why don't you return to the table without losing heart?`
` Milady is expecting your counterattack, you see...?"`
`"Fuck you!!`
` How the hell can I make a counterargument?!"`
`"In the first place, this has all been fucked up since about the time that the tower sprouted up out of the earth!!`
` Should I say that, actually, underground on Rokkenjima, there's a secret laboratory for massive transforming combining robots or something,`
` and that by pushing a button, a strange tower sprouts up?!"`
`"Right, and then those huge giants must be robots,`
` or maybe an evil secret association's mecha‐monsters?!"`
`"It makes no goddamn sense!!`
` Don't talk to meeeeeeeeeee, uuo{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}oohhh!!!"`
`"C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon, don't cry, alright??`
` Kaboom, kabang, it's magic!!"`
`"If you want, I'll crush the moon and make comets fall like rain!`
` I can even bury the whole island in those bouncy‐chested babes you like so much, seeeeeeeeee??`
` Hihhihhihhihhi!!"`
`"Come come, look look look, my turn is over, seeeeeeeeee?!`
` Show me your response, counterattack!!`
` You can't, can yoooooouuu?`
` I'm a quadrillion percent sure that you can't!!`
` You're useless against this, riiiiiiiiiight?`
` You actually like this kind of fantasy, don't yooooouuu??"`
`"I know all about it, this kind of stuff's been going around everywhere lately hasn't it?!`
` In manga and light novels, in anime and movies!`
` Some teenage brat has a whole bunch of some strange special abilities, and there's all these kabooms and badooms with the fate of the world at risk!"`
`"You looove that too, don't you?!`
` I know, don't hide it, you love it, right, hiihyahhyahhyah!!`
` That thing that you love just displayed itself a little before your eyes, that's all, riiiiight?"`
`"Why do you believe it in manga and anime, but you won't believe in meeeeeeeeee??`
` Believe, believe, believe it!`
` You can't argue back, not after you've been shown something like this, riiiiiiiiiiiiight?"`
`"C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon, answer me,`
` you don't need to think, you can just obediently say "I'm sorry, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama"!"`
`"Come on come on try saying it, "I'm sorry, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama", try saying it, say it say it, don't be embarrassed,`
` kukikiki{0}kak{0}ka{0}ka{0}kah{0}hyah{0}hya{0}a{0}a{0}ah{0}ha{0}hha{0}hha{0}ha{0}hhha{0}hahhya{0}aahh!!"`
