`"Hahahaha, wahahahaha!`
` I never thought that Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}'s piece would barge in at the very end...!"`
`"......I searched all over the place for a piece fitting for a game with you.`
` ......I'm sure that you'll grow to enjoy her."`
`"What's with that piece?!`
` Who was that person, who was it?!`
` She didn't say her name! That's not fair!!`
` Hey, don't you think so too?!"`
`"...I have a general idea.`
` ......Come on, normally, anyone would know."`
`"Normally?!`
` No we wouldn't, it was that character's first appearance, wasn't it?!`
` If she doesn't say her name, I won't—the players won't—everyone won't know, right?!"`
`"............Beato, it's alright if you don't tell her.`
` See?`
` Isn't she a funny kid?"`
`"M‐...mm.`
` ......Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s simple‐minded naiveté truly is precious and funny.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Why, why, why I am the only one you won't tell, you meanie!!`
` Okay, in exchange, I'll teach you a special secret that only I know!`
` So tell me!"`
`"......Hoh.`
` A special secret, you say!`
` Now that, I do want to hear...!"`
`"Blehhh!`
` If you want me to tell you, first tell me who that woman really was!`
` The secret I know sure is awesome!`
` I mean, it's gonna blow you away like finding out that Santa‐san is actually Daddy!"`
`"Huh?`
` *giggle*!`
` Oopsie{p:0:☆} Sorry, I'll bet you're so shocked that your world turned upside‐down, right?!`
` Oh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!"`
`".........Your father was the one who came to your place, Lambda?"`
`"To my place... Wait, what's that supposed to mean?"`
`"...Lord {f:5:Santa Claus} only visits the homes of children with clean hearts.`
` He didn't come to your place, then?"`
`"Well, Lord {f:5:Santa Claus} is gracious.`
` Unless you are a reeeally bad scoundrel, he will give you a present.`
` After all, he even gave them to me!"`
`".........As you grow and your heart becomes hardened, he stops coming, doesn't he?`
` How old were you, Beato, when he stopped coming?"`
`"Mm.`
` He stopped coming when I was about twelve.`
` My maiden's heart awoke, and I quickly got somewhat embarrassed about Lord {f:5:Santa} coming."`
`"After I wrote "Thanks for everything, that's enough.`
` So make sure you splurge on the last presents", he stopped coming.`
` Oooh, and I was looking forward to it too!`
` How old were you when he stopped coming, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}?"`
`".........I was pretty wild.`
` ...It happened fairly early.`
` I think when I was about nine.`
` ...Something about that beard really irritated me, so I waited in my futon with some sewing scissors ready, thinking I'd cut it off.`
` ............What a cringeworthy age."`
`"So, ......Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, as long as you can remember, Lord {f:5:Santa Claus} has never come to see you, you say.`
` ............He usually comes until the last year of elementary school or during middle school."`
`"...Maybe we should have a doctor look at her.`
` I hear that maturing too fast can have an adverse effect on the growth of mind and body.`
` ...Yeah, there's definitely some of those.`
` ...Adverse effects."`
`"Hey, wh‐what are you guys talking about!!`
` Gaaaaah!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Wahahahaha, it truly is boisterous when three witches gather!"`
`"......If you're talking about that level of secret, I doubt it's worth listening to.`
` Can I go now?`
` I have to prepare for the next game."`
`"Wha—hey, wait a sec!`
` Tell me who that woman really was!!"`
`"......Well then, tell me this special secret of yours first.`
` If it's good enough, then I'll tell you."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!!`
` Alright, I'll tell you, and it really is a special secret, okay?!`
` ......Remember, in this game, there was a girl who found the gold and became the new witch, right?"`
`"Mm.`
` Just what kind of secret could that person have?"`
`"Ehheheheheh!`
` I realized who that girl actually is.`
` Does anyone know?`
` *giggle*giggle*!`
` There was a hint in the way she talked."`
`"Remember, that girl said it a lot, right?`
` "Why don't you something foreverrrr?",`
` right?!`
` Yes, that phrase was the main point!`
` Foreverrrr?`
` For Evaaaa?`
` Yes!"`
`"She was actually...Ushiromiya Eva!!`
` What do you think?!`
` Are you shocked?!`
` Oh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!!"`
`"Hoh...!`
` I did not notice that!`
` ...Mngh, to think that there would be a hint in a place like that."`
`"......You're good at playing along with her, Beato.`
` This kid can get a little full of herself, so don't take it too far.`
` See you, I'm leaving."`
`"Wait, wait!`
` It's not fair if you just listen to my secret and don't tell me yours!!`
` Tell me who she really was!!"`
`"......Your secret was so incredible that mine just wouldn't match up.`
` ...So in exchange, I'll tell you my own special secret.`
` I'll tell you the name of the culprit in this game called {i:Higurashi no Naku Koro ni}."`
`"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, don't tell meee!!`
` I'm playing it right nowwww!!"`
`"......Ahhahahahahhahhahhahhah...`
` See you, Beato.`
` The black tea was delicious.`
` Oh, about the crackers, though, the repertoire of jam was lacking.`
` Get some gochujang chili paste every once in a while.`
` It goes great with Russian tea.`
` Later."`
`"I see. Alright.`
` I shall try it.`
` I shall call for you when the preparations are finished for the next game.`
` Until then, feel free to draw up a strategy at your leisure."`
`"Yes, I will.`
` This last game was pretty interesting.`
` Later."`
`"Heyyy, wait a sec, tell meee!!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` My, my, you two really are close."`
`"..............................`
` ......Yes, that's right.`
` ...Oh, how I love you, {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` You could even say I'm in love with you."`
`"......I want to gouge out her eyes so she can see no one other than me.`
` ......Oh, wouldn't that just be to die for?`
` It'd be wonderful to dunk them in black tea.`
` Ahah!"`
`"Who knew she had entranced Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} to this extent.`
` ......It seems I carry a heavy responsibility.`
` Still, this last game truly was close!`
` I was a breath away from defeating Battler."`
`"..................Beato.`
` Can I ask you something?"`
`"What is it?`
` I won't tell you that girl's name.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"...Just when are you going to stop screwing around?`
` ...Do you even have the {i:slightest} intention of winning?"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} threatened her with a low voice that she had never used in front of {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`...It completely blew away the calm atmosphere which had been there until a moment ago.`
`".........You know,`
` I'm supporting you 'cause you're meant to be a witch who can win against {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` If you don't have the power to win against her,`
` then I'm ready to abandon you at any time, got it......?"`
`"...............How scathing.`
` What about me dissatisfies you?`
` ...As you know, my game board is perfect.`
` Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} will never be able to win..."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` Your board truly is impressive.`
` {f:5:Bernkastel} could spend a hundred years,`
` or even a thousand years here, and she would still be unable to win against this game board, it truly is that impressive and perfect."`
`"......That's why, in exchange for letting me borrow that, I made you a witch.`
` .........If I stop being your guardian, you'll immediately go back to being a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` ...Make sure you don't forget that, no matter how much incredible magical power you hold, ......you are nothing more than a temporary witch."`
`"I, ......I know that.`
` ...I am grateful to you..."`
`"Don't speak so casually.`
` I'll forgive that when {f:5:Bernkastel}'s around, but I won't when she isn't.`
` Recently, maybe you've forgotten your debt to me."`
`"Th‐that is, .........n‐...not, ......not so, my Lady......"`
`"...Aah, changed my mind, that creeps me out.`
` You can talk the same way as usual.`
` But be mindful of what you say.`
` ......I have a surprisingly short temper, you see?"`
`"M‐......mm......"`
`"Back to the point.`
` ...Your game board truly is perfect.`
` ......You should be able to defeat {f:5:Bernkastel} without any trouble.`
` ...But that kid won't give in easily.`
` She'll challenge you over and over."`
`"That is no problem.`
` ...It has been certified by you, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` ......My game board is perfect."`
`"Yeah, that's right, it's perfect.`
` ............So long as you, the player, are perfect as well, that is?"`
`".........I don't understand what you mean by this..."`
`"What {i:I} mean by this...?`
` That's what {i:I} want to ask {i:you}.`
` .........You play around a lot in your games.`
` ...At first, I thought it was part of your tactics, because it would completely baffle {f:5:Bernkastel} from time to time."`
`"............But I get the feeling that's not quite true.`
` You're not playing around in a match you know you can win,`
` ......the truth is, you don't care whether you win or lose, do you?"`
`"R‐......ridiculous...`
` How could that be..."`
`"Listen close, okay?`
` Your role is to break {f:5:Bernkastel}, force her to yield.`
` In other words, that means being the victor in this game for all eternity.`
` ......As long as you keep trying to become the {i:certain} victor, then I will give you my power as the Witch of Certainty.`
` ............However."`
`"If you fight in a way that doesn't deny any possibility of your loss,`
` ...that's a different story."`
`"This is a game, of course...`
` In the same way that Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} will lose if I win,`
` ...there will be some days on which I will lose and she will win.`
` The possibility of loss always exists.`
` That is why I—"`
`"...............This is why you're useless.`
` There's no need for this to be a game board for you.`
` It simply needs to be a bird cage to lock {f:5:Bernkastel} up here for all eternity."`
`"...What's the role of a bird cage?`
` Making certain that the little bird inside never escapes.`
` ......What's a bird cage worth if it has gaps that sometimes let the bird out?"`
`".........O‐of course, games exist to be won.`
` So it is impossible for me to lose.`
` ...Therefore, I will continue to win......`
` ...As you wish, for all eternity..."`
`"Good answer—that's all I want.`
` ......I'll allow you to play around and use fakes as part of your tactics.`
` ...It was sometimes effective in this last game."`
`"............But hear this.`
` If you make a move hoping for anything else other than victory,`
` ............make sure you're wonderfully prepared, okay?"`
`"I, I will not do such a thing...`
` I swear it...!"`
`"............Originally, you weren't even a witch,`
` and I can remind you what a truly shabby creature you were at any time.`
` ............If you betray my expectations...`
` At that time, I will have a delightful delightful penalty waiting for you."`
`"...Of the billions of fragment worlds out there, ......I'll send you into the most miserable fragment and seal you there.`
` .........You were miserable in the first place, so it'll be worth choosing a really miserable fragment.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"................................."`
`"Oh, how I love you, {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` ...Scrabble your feet in {f:5:Beatrice}'s bird cage as much as you like,`
` and spend a thousand years learning that you can no longer escape."`
`"......And when you give in,`
` ...I'll train you so that you can't tweet in anyone's palm but mine."`
`"............*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*,`
` ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!"`
