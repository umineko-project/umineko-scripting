`"...Six years ago, you say?`
` I mean, six years, that's like the whole of elementary school, isn't it?`
` It's pretty unfair to ask me to remember, don't you think?"`
`"I agree.`
` Especially since we were so young; we've grown a lot in these six years.`
` Actually, if we hadn't been introduced, maybe we wouldn't have been able to remember you."`
`"You think?`
` I knew it was Battler right away.`
` After he opened his mouth, I was even more sure."`
`"Uu.`
` I met him for the first time.`
` Don't know about six years ago."`
`"That's natural.`
` You were only three, after all."`
`"When you say it like that, I'm the same.`
` I only knew Maria when she was three years old, and since she's grown so big, yeah, no wonder I didn't recognize her."`
`After lunch, we had all gone out to the beach to walk around, talk and take it easy enjoying ourselves.`
`Our parents appeared somehow on edge, and seemed to have things to catch up on, so we had decided to leave our seats.`
`...Just as you'd expect, since it had been six years, the conversation focused on me.`
`"Still, you've really gotten taller.`
` I won't call myself short, but anyway, your height surprised me."`
`"That's right. I remember well what Battler‐sama was like six years ago, but I was surprised even so."`
`"Totally.`
` I could never have imagined this from how Battler looked six years back."`
`"I'm surprised at how everyone remembers so much about six years ago.`
` My memory's all hazy."`
`"Not surprised.`
` I mean, you seemed to take a while even remembering us.`
` That hurts a bit, ya know?"`
`"Come on, this was six years ago, right?`
` It's ridiculous to ask me to remember...!"`
`"...So, you can't remember things that happened six years ago very well?`
` I can remember as clearly as if it was yesterday..."`
`"That's because your memory is good, Shannon.`
` I bet you remember well what kind of things Battler‐kun did and said six years ago, don't you?"`
`"Come to think of it, that's right.`
` Shannon's memory is surprisingly good when it comes to certain things."`
`"Uu.`
` I'm crappy at remembering.`
` Remember fun stuff well but horrible at boring stuff.`
` Uu."`
`We all laughed, saying that everyone was like that.`
`"Shannon.`
` By the way, what was Battler like six years ago?`
` Remember any interesting episodes?"`
`"Let's see.`
` ......I'm sure that he said something like this when he left.`
` "I'll be back... <See you again>.`
` I'll come for you riding a white horse.""`
`"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh,`
` doooooooon't, so embarrassiiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiing!!"`
`"Gyaaah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!!"`
`"I bet he did, I bet he did!`
` That's exactly what he was like, six years ago he was always full of those stupid lines!"`
`"Waaahahahahaha!!"`
`"Hahahaha.`
` It really does sound like something Battler‐kun would have said back then."`
`"Uu.`
` Embarrassing? Embarrassing?"`
`"......Yeah.`
` Horribly embarrassing..."`
`"Maria, I'm sure that when you are in middle school, you'll want to say embarrassing things like that...`
` When that happens, write it on the back of some leaflet first, and read it three times before you decide to say it out loud.`
` If you don't, you'll definitely regret it..."`
`"Still, everyone has to pass through that painful period...`
` That's right, that's how you know your place, learn shame, and become an adult.`
` Yes, this is a memory I want to disappear, the bittersweet kind of thing that everyone does in adolescence as they transition to becoming adults...`
` Aaaaarrggh..."`
`You see, I tend to let my mouth run wild without thinking too much, so I don't remember all the details of everything I say.`
`But when the contents are recited back to me afterwards, it's always something extremely embarrassing.`
`In recent years, I have finally come to understand this weakness, and have been working hard to refrain from such careless outbursts, but......`
`...It seems I was just born with the habit of speaking without thinking, and there isn't a whole lot I can do about it.`
`"Shanno~n, do you remember any other embarrassing things?"`
`"Yes, well... I remember various other things, but...`
`......since it looks like the person in question wants to forget them, I think I will refrain from saying any more..."`
`"To be blunt, there's nothing else I remembe~r.`
` Please don't remind meeee."`
`"...Uu.`
` Shannon's bullying Battler...?`
` Uu.`
` Bad.`
` Bullying is bad."`
`"Hahahahaha. She isn't really bullying him.`
` Let's leave it at that, okay?"`
`"But Shannon, you'll have tell me all about it sometime Battler‐kun isn't around.`
` It sounds pretty interesting."`
`"Yes, certainly."`
`"N‐noooo, you can't, Shannon‐chaaaaaaaaaan...!!"`
`For a while, George‐aniki teased me by pretending to ask Shannon‐chan for more of my embarrassing misspeaks.`
`George‐aniki was messing around teamed up with Shannon‐chan,`
` ......but he seemed, how to describe it, very candid and frank.`
`He was always frank with his cousins, but he usually took on a reserved, gentlemanly attitude when he came in contact with the servants.`
`...When I thought about it, I got the feeling that he was acting a little overly familiar, which seemed slightly weird.`
`Maria started scribbling in the sand with a stick,`
` and George‐aniki and Shannon‐chan joined in, which left me and Jessica off to the side, so I asked her secretively.`
`"......Hey, Jessica.`
` Is George‐aniki, ......umm, going out with Shannon‐chan?"`
`"Ooooh?`
` What the, how did you notice?!`
` Battler, you've got more of an eye for people than I thought."`
`"Huh, ...whaaaaaaah?!`
` I was just kidding— They're actually going out?!"`
`"Shhh!`
` Your voice is too loud!`
` ...They are actually keeping it secret for now, apparently, alright?`
` It'd be better if nobody heard about it, especially Auntie Eva."`
`"I, I see...`
` Love with a servant..."`
`"...Y‐yeah, but, since when?`
` Wowww, a lot can happen in six years......`
` But still, Aniki really is talented, and Shannon‐chan is kind and spirited...`
` ......They might be a pretty good match."`
`Actually, six years ago, I remember taking notice of her just a little bit.`
`So that's how it is... She really fits well with George‐aniki... Nothing I can do about that.`
` ...Goodbye, my fleeting first love of six years ago...`
`.........Which means that...my collection of embarrassing lines that Shannon‐chan just held back on...`
`...probably has something to do with that...`
` Aaaaaaaaaaarrghh, I can't take it...`
`"How long have they been going out?"`
`"That depends on what you call going out, but I'd say it's definitely been at least a year.`
` If you count the time before either of them confessed, it'd be several years, I guess."`
`Before I'd realized it, the two of them had separated themselves from the group, and were walking down the beach, talking about something.`
`......They looked calm,`
` and rather than a light relationship between two lovers, it looked like a more serious relationship, as though they were already engaged.`
`"......Six years...`
` That's a long‐ass time."`
`"What did these six years mean to me?`
` I've just gotten taller.`
` It was just a waste of time, six years I spent obstinately fighting with my dad."`
`"What about you, Battler?`
` Have you gotten a girlfriennnd?"`
`"Hmm, I wonder.`
` There's a lot of girls that I play with.`
` But I don't have that "special one" yet.`
` ......I'm probably just a kid.`
` I think it's more fun to be noisy with a large group of people than being alone with one person."`
`"Aah, that's so you, Battler.`
` But take your relationships with your female friends seriously."`
`"Girls can be scary with their communities and their wrong impressions, okay?`
` There could be some secret feud going on over you, and someone might be crying or being hurt without you noticing it, you know?"`
`"That's so weird.`
` I think I got the same bit of advice from one of the girls in my class just last week.`
` ......What's with that?`
` Why can't we all have fun together?`
` Do they all really want to find a special person that badly?"`
`"...It's probably because you've never had a partner like that, Battler.`
` Well, you'll probably run into a girl like that at some point.`
` Just gotta wait it out!"`
`"What?`
` It sounds almost like you've already found a partner like that.`
` What about you?`
` Have you gotten a boyfriend?"`
`"Huh?!`
` M‐me?!`
` No, err, wahahahahaha......"`
`"Come on, that reaction's so easy to understand...`
` From the looks of it, there's some boy who you're thinking about, but you haven't been able to confess that to him yet, something like that."`
`"N‐no, umm, that's not, umm, uh!`
` C‐cram it, jackass, who cares about me...!"`
`"You're the one who brought up this subject, why do you have to go and get mad at me?`
` Women are creatures who always ask questions, and yet, they almost never answer them.`
` What cruel creatures, seriously."`
`"......W‐well, okay, umm.`
` ...I did try...`
`...to confess once.`
` Well, umm, I struck out pretty badly."`
`"Did they say "Sorry"?"`
`"No, umm, ......`
`...well, umm, it was really one‐sided and they were just, like, taken aback, I guess...`
` It was like they didn't even view me that way."`
`"I can understand that.`
` You talk just like a man.`
` If you don't act a little more elegant, you won't be able to entice a man's heart, you know?"`
`"I‐i‐is it really...`
` ......Is the way I speak...`
`...really that bad?"`
`"...Hmm?`
` Well, uhh, how you talk isn't everything, but if someone like you, who usually talks badly,`
` suddenly started making an effort to talk nicely, umm, that takes courage, and that might really get some guys' hearts thumping, maybe."`
`"R‐really...?`
` I see......`
` ......Yeah..."`
`Jessica had suddenly started speaking meekly, and was faintly blushing.`
`...I see, even though her confession didn't go well, it looks like she still hasn't given up.`
`But yeah...I totally get that.`
` After seeing how close George‐aniki and Shannon‐chan have gotten, it's no wonder she'd start wanting a boyfriend.`
`Six years.`
` ...Those six years of puberty are pretty important, and they go by so fast.`
`With the typhoon approaching, the clouds had grown steadily grayer, and yet, even so, I had this really refreshing feeling.`
`...Maybe I'll start thinking more seriously about the opposite sex, more than just the size of their boobs...`
`"By the way,`
` I know George‐aniki is going out with a servant, Shannon‐chan.`
` ......Not you as well, right?"`
`"Huh, ...eeeeeeh?!?!`
` Wh‐wh‐wh‐wh‐why do you think that...?!"`
`"Come to think of it, that young kid Kanon‐kun, who greeted us in the rose garden.`
` You covered for him quite a bit just considering he was bad at talking, didn't you?"`
`"N‐no, that's not...`
` Wahahahaha, you're too suspicious...!!"`
`"Then tell me just this one thing.`
` Right now,`
` is the boy you're after somewhere within one kilometer?"`
`"W‐well, that's, umm, ...I, I, I dunno..."`
`Kanon‐kun is the only boy on this island now who could possibly become her boyfriend.`
` So judging by her reaction, I'm probably right on.`
`I don't think of the Ushiromiya family as a noble family, but...two people in love with servants...`
` I'd never have dreamed that two pairs of Romeo and Juliet would be right next to me...`
`Auntie Eva will probably become an obstacle to George‐aniki and Shannon‐chan's love.`
`If Auntie Eva learns that the partner of her only son, the apple of her eye, is {i:Shannon‐chan},`
` she'll probably scream at her with cries of wretched servant, homewrecker, and so forth.`
`And a relationship between Jessica and Kanon‐kun would probably be just as full of difficulties.`
`{n}Aunt Natsuhi also seemed the type to be strict about that kind of thing.`
`......After all, Jessica's husband would probably become the head of the Ushiromiya family in the future.`
` If that person had once been a servant working for the family, ......well, no doubt things would be complicated.`
`"Well, everyone finds their own way in love.`
` Who cares, as long as you find someone you enjoy being with?"`
`"Being with someone doesn't require any permission as long as the two people accept each other.`
` If you worry about your parents or your family, then you lose.`
` Don't forget that.`
` You can't go out with someone with half‐hearted feelings."`
`"...Heh...`
` I can't believe you're saying something so philosophical‐sounding when you've never ever been in love."`
`"Don't treat love like a matter of profit and loss.`
` It's about <heart>.`
` That's all I want to say.`
` Well then,`
` <see you again, have a nice day>."`
`"......Pf,`
` ...wahhahhahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` George nii‐san, Shanno~n, listen, listennn!`
` This guy, he's said another one of those lines!!"`
`"I didn't say anything, I didn't say anything!!`
` Waaah, don't make fun of me, don't make fun of me!!"`
`"I heard, I heard!`
` <See you aga~in>, <see you aga~in>!!"`
`For a while, we forgot about the wind getting stronger, and played around on the beach.`
`......This meeting with my cousins, who had grown so much over these last six years and were thoroughly enjoying their youth, felt truly refreshing.`
`......It was a little late now, but I realized that I should have buried the hatchet a lot sooner, and returned to the Ushiromiya family...`
`"It sure is nice to spend time together as cousins every once in a while..."`
`"Uu!`
` I like it with all the cousins together, it's funnn!"`
`"That's right.`
` We're already old enough.`
` It's not like we couldn't meet each other when our parents aren't around.`
` ...It might not be a bad idea for just us cousins to meet up and play every once in a while."`
`"That's a good plan.`
` Maybe we should set up something like that someday."`
`"I agree.`
` I'd like for us cousins at least to always be friendly with each other."`
`"Hey, hey, if you put the emphasis there, doesn't that make it sound like our normal families don't get along well?"`
`"Hahahahahaha."`
`George‐aniki and Jessica laughed, but it felt just a little strained.`
` ...Did I say too much?`
`Judging by how our parents had made quiet expressions and tired faces every once in a while during the boat ride and at the airport, maybe that was something I shouldn't have said.`
`"...That's right.`
` Just like Jessica said.`
` Let's always be friendly with each other."`
`"Uu!`
` Me too!`
` Everyone friendly!!"`
`"That's right.`
` Yeah.`
` We'll always be together.`
` We'll always be friendly."`
`"Heheh.`
` Man, we've been saying some pretty embarrassing stuff.`
` I feel kinda awkward."`
`"But I think that is very important.`
` It's very hard for people to always be friendly, let alone always be together, unless they wish for it."`
`"That's right.`
` You really can't take everyone being friendly for granted."`
`"Uu.`
` A witch I know said it.`
` Happiness won't be granted unless everyone believes in it."`
`"That's true.`
` Maybe some magic exists in the power of belief.`
` If we all believe in that, I'm sure it will bring us happiness."`
`"Alright.`
` Now the next embarrassing thing.`
` Let's all swear to believe together, alright?`
` That we'll all always be friendly, that we'll always be happy."`
`Screw becoming like our parents.`
`Searching for each other's weaknesses, going after Grandfather's fortune, screw all that forever...`
`"Alright!`
` We'll always be friendly and happy.`
` And let's all believe that."`
`No matter how long it had been, or how much fun we were having, it didn't stop the dark clouds from approaching Rokkenjima.`
`......I wonder if the typhoon will pass and show us the refreshing sky before we leave this island.`
`Who gives a crap about what our parents are plotting?`
`{n}Who gives a crap about the inheritance and the honor of our old family?`
`We're so young, and renewing our old friendship.`
`{n}And every one of us believes together that we can all be happy.`
`So...`
`I want this day to end,`
` without anything weird occurring,`
` in peace and happiness,`
` calmly...`
`No, ...not "I want it to end".`
`{n}......Please, let it end......!`
`"In your dreeeeeeeeeeeams!`
` Kyah‐hahah‐hah‐hah‐haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"Damn iiiiiiiit!!`
` Don't show up, don't appear!!`
` Damndamndaaamn!!"`
`"Sorry to keep you waiting.`
` The new game has finally been prepared."`
`"Come, let us begin this tale of tragedy!`
` Come to me, rain, winds, typhoon!`
` Cut this island off from the real world!!`
` Throw Rokkenjima into another world, into the netherworld, into a world of fantasy!"`
`And so, the tale repeated for the third time.`
`However, before the Endless Witch,`
` what point was there in counting one, two, three?`
`There was probably no point at all.`
`After all, this tale of fantasy would be repeated endlessly, until the match was settled, and either Battler or the witch surrendered.`
`And the sky grew dark and cloudy, the rain and wind were summoned together and became a typhoon...`
`And Maria could be seen in the rose garden, paying no mind to the rain that had started falling,`
` going around in circles, searching for that single rose which she had surely marked......`
`".........Not here...`
` Not here......`
` The rose we marked,`
` ......my rose isn't here...`
` ......Uu.`
` ............Uu!!"`
`Maria definitely remembered it.`
`That rose had been in the flower bed right here.`
` And yet, it wasn't.`
`She didn't know what to do with her irritation at not being able to find something which should have been there,`
` and, moaning bitterly, she couldn't help but keep going back and forth in circles around the same spot.`
`She was acting almost as though she would be able to see it if she looked at a different angle,`
` but try as she might, there was no way she would find something that wasn't there...`
`The wind grew increasingly stronger, and the rain turned into cold, large drops.`
`{n}There was no way Maria wasn't bothered by this.`
`However, if she couldn't find her rose here, it would surely disappear forever.`
`...Maria believed that.`
` That feeling spurred her on to keep searching for a rose that she had no chance of finding...`
`Just then, the cold drops of rain that were tormenting Maria were suddenly blocked.`
`"..................Uu?"`
`Maria raised her head.`
` ...When she did, she saw that an umbrella was opened there, protecting her from the rain...`
`And the one holding out that umbrella was...`
`......the witch she admired, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}...!!"`
`"What are you doing so frantically in the middle of all this rain?`
` You could catch a cold like this.`
` Even witches have to care for their own health."`
`"My...`
` ...My rose...`
` I can't find it...`
` ......Uu.`
` No matter how many times I search,`
` ......even though it was definitely here,`
` ...can't find it..."`
`Maria told {f:5:Beatrice} about how there had been a slightly unhealthy, pitiful rose,`
` and that she was sure they had marked it.`
`"Hohoh.`
` And you can't find it.`
` .........If you are a witch apprentice, you should use magic to search for the rose.`
` I believe that as long as you search with merely your eyes, it won't be nearly enough."`
`"......Uu.`
` ......Can't find it.`
` ...I did my best, and tried to search with magic, but can't find it..."`
`"While this is certainly ideal for practicing your magic, it might be a little too much for you with all of this wind and rain.`
` ......Allow me to lend you some special power.`
` Concern for one's disciples is also among the duties of a master."`
`"Tha‐...thank youuu.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}!!"`
`Maria's face, which had been full of sadness until just now, split open into a grin.`
`Maria knew.`
` She knew that there was nothing {f:5:Beatrice}'s magic couldn't do.`
`So she was sure that {f:5:Beatrice} would easily be able to find the rose that she couldn't find herself...`
`{f:5:Beatrice} closed her eyes lightly, acting as though she was listening for something in all this wind and rain.`
` Then she heard it, opened her eyes, and spoke.`
`"............Hmm.`
` All things in this world are transitory.`
` It is unfortunate, Maria.`
` ...It seems that your rose couldn't withstand all of this wind and rain."`
`"Uu......`
` Then, my rose is.........?"`
`"It was uprooted by the wind, and is no longer of this world."`
`"..................Uu......"`
`What {f:5:Beatrice} had said was certainly plausible.`
` ...There was nothing odd about the flower being broken off at the stem in this strong wind.`
`...However, Maria couldn't accept this, and bitterly gave a low‐pitched moan...`
`"...............No."`
`"Hoh?"`
`"......No no no!`
` It's my rose!!`
` My rose has to come back!`
` I'll bring it back to life with my magic."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}, teach me how to revive a rose with magic...!!"`
`"Ha!`
` It's much too early for an apprentice like you to learn the hidden art of Endless Magic.`
` Know your place."`
`"..................Uuuu."`
`Maria wiped the tears from her eyes, full of regret.`
`Seeing that expression, which so invited pity, {f:5:Beatrice} shrugged her shoulders and chuckled.`
`"Very well.`
` I will lend you power for the hidden art that can revive a rose."`
`"Really?!"`
`"Yes.`
` ......Well then, concentrate the power of your heart.`
` Close your eyes, forget the rain, forget the wind, search for the soul of the wandering rose with the eyes of your heart."`
`"......Uu."`
`Maria closed her eyes.`
`{n}Then, she repeated {f:5:Beatrice}'s poem‐like words...`
`"Come, try to remember.`
` Rose, what form did you have?"`
`"...Come, try to remember.`
` Rose, what form did you have...?"`
`"Don't look.`
` Don't listen.`
` And believe.`
` ......Release the power of your soul from the cage of flesh that imprisons it.`
` ............That's it.`
` ......Good..."`
`Around Maria, who was concentrating her power, her eyes tightly shut, small golden butterflies began to dance.`
` ......Was this the manifestation of the magical power Maria held?`
`"Lost soul of the rose.`
` Gather into one, and remember your form.`
` ......Come, gather, remember..."`
`The glitter of the gold butterflies began to strengthen, and their numbers increased; then, {f:5:Beatrice} raised a finger up to the skies, and they began to gather at the tip of that finger...`
`This was the miracle of the golden magic...`
`And the gold butterflies began to condense into a single dazzling grain of gold.`
` ......It was a single seed, glittering gold.`
`It sat on the tip of {f:5:Beatrice}'s finger, budded into a golden sprout, and opened into a golden leaf.`
` It then slowly fell from that fingertip, sank into the mud of the flower bed, and began to grow steadily...`
`...Maria, who admired magic and witches, must have really wanted to see this fantastical sight.`
`However, as an apprentice, Maria was still not qualified to see it.`
`...No, she was probably afraid that, if she opened her eyes to look, the power of her heart's concentration would be interrupted, and the magic would be lost.`
`Therefore, it was {f:5:Beatrice}, the one permitted to lay eyes on that golden miracle,`
` who was the one and only witch, and the master of many miracles...`
`Then, the fully grown rose bloomed, creating one golden flower.`
`And when {f:5:Beatrice} poked it with her finger in just the right way,`
` the gold‐colored sparkles scattered, just as if a golden soap bubble had popped, and what remained was a single beautiful rose.`
`"...Mmhm.`
` It looks like you've remembered a splendid rose."`
`"......However, if we just leave it mixed in with these other roses, you won't be able to tell it apart.`
` Shall I perform one last service?"`
`{f:5:Beatrice}, for the sake of her cute apprentice witch who was moaning even more now in concentration,`
` decided to cast one more little spell.`
`She snapped her fingers, and a single gold butterfly appeared, fluttered around, and landed on the flower that had just been revived.`
`Then it suddenly burst open and disappeared, becoming golden lace and marking the rose...`
`"That is sufficient.`
` ......Maria.`
` You may open your eyes now."`
`".........Uu?`
` Where's the rose?`
` Not here.`
` Not here."`
`"Not over there, over here.`
` ...Look.`
` I have marked it with golden lace."`
`"Wow... You did...!!`
` Awesome awesome awesome awesome!!`
` Thank you Beato, thank you Beato!!`
` I want to become a witch quickly, a Great Witch like Beato!!"`
`"And you can.`
` Long ago, I too wished for that innocently, just as you do, and I have attained that level."`
`Maria was ecstatic over the revived rose, clapping her hands and jumping around in joy.`
`...Watching that, {f:5:Beatrice} also smiled, looking fairly pleased.`
`Now, if I try, I can break or repair any soul, not just that of a rose, and kill and revive as I please.`
`So, the barrier created by the storm has closed Rokkenjima off from the real world.`
`Now is the time for the Golden Witch, the Endless Witch, {f:5:Beatrice} to descend.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} pulled from her pocket an envelope with the family crest, the One‐winged Eagle, and gave it to Maria.`
`Maria frolicked around at being selected to be the witch's messenger.`
`"So, Kinzo.`
` I've come to join in on your fun once again...`
` My preparations are already complete.`
` What about you?`
` I assume you have prepared enough coins to bet in tonight's game...?"`
`"Naturally, I am fully prepared, {f:5:Beatrice}...!!`
` I have prepared pieces in abundance.`
` I am ready both physically and mentally!"`
`"So, let me pay the ante.`
` All that you have given should be returned to you in the end.`
` Now, take it!!"`
`Kinzo flung the window of his study wide open, took off the reasonably large golden ring which had been on his finger,`
` and threw it into the darkness of the raging wind and rain...`
`That ring was struck by lightning, and after twinkling gold for an instant, disappeared.`
`Kinzo watched it go, grinning broadly and fearlessly.`
`"I don't see myself losing.`
` You are mine.`
` Forever!!"`
`The ring that Kinzo had thrown became a single gold butterfly, and fluttered around in the wind and rain.`
`It headed for the rose garden, almost as though it was being guided there.`
`It then found the figure of the Golden Witch, and fluttered down......`
`When it arrived right in front of {f:5:Beatrice},`
` it burst in a flash of gold, and returned to its original form of a ring, flipping up into the air.`
`It seemed as if it would simply fall back down into a puddle of water, but suddenly it stopped in midair.`
` ...Almost as if some transparent person had caught it.`
`Somehow, this seemed unexpected even to {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`However, she soon realized what—who—it was, and grinned broadly at it.`
`As she did, the figure of the person who had caught the ring began to fuzzily appear...`
`It was the figure of a young man wearing a butler's uniform embroidered with the One‐winged Eagle crest...`
`There was no man like this among the servants who served the Ushiromiya family.`
`{n}Even so, {f:5:Beatrice} laughed as though it was someone she remembered fondly.`
`"Ronove, is it.`
` ......It's been quite some time.`
` It seems that you have remembered me.`
` You always were a man who was serious about loyalty."`
`"It has been a very long time since you last corresponded...`
` There has not been a single day that I, Ronove, have forgotten that I serve you, Milady."`
`"Indeed, I was more fearful that you had forgotten about me, Milady.`
` I have, after all, known you to be quite forgetful."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...!`
` I see, yes, it seems I do forget easily.`
` I couldn't even remember your wry speech until I heard it again."`
`"For you, Milady."`
`With an exaggerated yet elegant gesture, he bowed respectfully,`
` and held out to {f:5:Beatrice} the Head's Ring that he had just caught.`
`"It is the Ushiromiya family Head's Ring, returned to you from Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
` It is now, once again, in the possession of its master."`
`"Indeed.`
` The proclamation by Kinzo that the game has started.`
` I acknowledge receipt."`
`"So, how would you like to play tonight?`
` Shall I prepare the roulette immediately?`
` Or shall I prepare some black tea first?"`
`"Both sound attractive, but for now, I suspect I need you to greet someone.`
` I am quite sure that man has his mouth hanging open and can't shut it.`
` Right, Battler?"`
`"Greetings.`
` Allow me to introduce myself.`
` I am called Ronove, and I serve at the side of Milady {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` It is truly a pleasure to meet you."`
`"See?`
` His mouth's hanging open and he can't shut it, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Isn't that obvious, another incomprehensible guy's just appeared!!`
` I grumbled that goat‐headed people would start doing the Bon dance, and then goat‐heads started showing up in swarms,`
` and since then, not only have those seven sexy‐assed babes appeared, but now even a butler has goddamn shown up!!`
` It doesn't make sense, cut it out!!"`
`"By the way, Battler.`
` Did you notice?`
` Have you realized that your meeting him...is a true "Devil's Proof"?"`
`"A, a Devil's Proof...?!`
` What do you mean...?"`
`"He may not look like it, but this guy is a genuine demon, with his name amongst the 72.`
` In other words, I've brought a demon right in front of you, which truly proves that they exist."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` Ronove holds a noble rank in Hell, the 27th highest‐ranked Great Demon.`
` He's a pretty useful man.`
` I summoned him at high cost and made him serve me."`
`"It is an honor to be introduced to you.`
` While my name is amongst those of the nobles of Hell,`
` I now serve as the head furniture of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, vulgar {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} and Great Witch from whom even demons would flee in fear."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*. He's a very useful man, but he is impudent with his words.`
` It's slightly frustrating that he sometimes forgets to respect his master."`
`"There is nothing in my contract regarding the way in which I must speak.`
` Would you like to change that contract?"`
`"It doesn't bore me, so it's fine.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`{f:5:Beatrice} turned her back to him, cackling.`
`After bowing once to her back, Ronove turned back to Battler and stuck out his right hand, showing off an innocent smile.`
` Normally, this would mean that he was asking for a handshake.`
`"......Wh‐...what is this supposed to be?"`
`"I am also one who has been subjected to Milady's whims.`
` In that sense, I am sure that we could become good friends.`
` This is a handshake of friendship."`
`"......Of course, it does not mean that you will be entered into a demon's contract, so rest assured."`
`"Sorry, but I'm right in the middle of a big fight with your master.`
` I only shake hands with an enemy after one of those situations like you find in teen dramas, when we've beaten each other up in a rainy schoolyard and are all worn out.`
` Remember that."`
`"I see.`
` Then, to shake hands with you, Battler‐sama, I must create a fitting atmosphere in a suitable location,`
` and we must exchange body language and sweet words that ring true to the heart.`
` I will find a suitable opportunity to prepare such a location."`
`"I too looove those kinds of situations, you know?`
` Pu ku ku ku...!"`
`Laughing tauntingly, Ronove whispered that to Battler, with his face so close that their noses were almost touching.`
`Battler, his face turning red after getting so close to another of the same sex, pushed him away.`
`"Y‐you're a creepy bastard...`
` I see, just right for Beato's butler..."`
`"It is an honor to receive such words of praise.`
` I am very confident in my tea brewing abilities, so please look forward to tea time.`
` Baking cookies is one of my hobbies, so I encourage you to have high expectations for the teacakes and such."`
`"Just what I would expect from a pair of the same gender.`
` You've started to get along well very quickly.`
` I'm jealous."`
`"My, my.`
` I apologize most humbly for making you jealous, Milady.`
` I will not stealthily snatch your guest away from you."`
`"Well then, I will leave for now to greet the rest of the furniture and inform them that I have retaken my post as head furniture.`
` Please forgive my short absence."`
`"Mmhm.`
` Only the common goats and the Seven Sisters used for the ritual have manifested themselves.`
` You will be able to finish up greeting them with ease."`
`"Oh?`
` Those lively Seven Sisters are here?`
` I wonder whether those naughty girls have grown a little more graceful?"`
`"......Ihihi.`
` If that's graceful, I'd have to doubt the definition of graceful."`
`"Is that so?`
` It seems that you have already enjoyed some playtime with the Seven Sisters."`
`"Judging by your expression, it seems that they are just as naughty as they were before.`
` Even though I am always telling them to act more fitting as a group of those who serve {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` What troublesome kids..."`
`"If that's your problem, don't worry.`
` They actually act perfectly fitting for their master..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` You have started to grow some guts!"`
`"However, to have a conversation is to acknowledge the person you are talking to.`
` Now that you have started to respond to my idle chatting, that is proof that you are gradually starting to accept my existence."`
`"Heh.`
` That's because, even if the sun starts rising from the west, I will definitely, definitely‐definitely, never accept that you're a witch.`
` Maybe if you start crying and kissing my shoes, I might be willing to have a more constructive discussion."`
`Even if Battler was bluffing, he still spoke forcefully, a fearless expression on his face.`
`The witch and her butler snickered together, realizing that their guest had regained more than enough of his willpower to take on a new game,`
` and that the preparations were complete...`
`After Ronove exchanged a few words with {f:5:Beatrice}, he bowed silently to Battler, scattered into gold butterflies, and disappeared.`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` It is truly pleasing when everything gets so lively."`
`"......How boring were those days when I was trapped alone on this island, unable to regain my power and without anyone to talk to."`
`"......I get how that creepy‐ass guy is really fitting as your butler."`
`"...But tell me.`
` Why has that butler only appeared now?`
` You said something about how only the goats and the seven stake chicks had manifested themselves.`
` What did that mean...?"`
`"Hmm, yes.`
` You still fight it, but I am a fully fledged witch.`
` I am in contact with a good many nonhuman entities in the netherworld."`
`"I'm sure.`
` None of your contacts are halfway near decent.`
` First some goat monsters, then those sexy‐assed babes, and this time a demon butler's showed up.`
` ......I don't want to say it, but there better not be more and more of these weird guys to come..."`
`"Hahahaha!`
` How much furniture do you think I have serving at my great golden mansion, how many demons do you think visit me there?`
` They will keep coming.`
` They will appear in any number."`
`"When the door to the Golden Land is opened, I will call back all of my furniture, and build my new castle here on Rokkenjima.`
` Then I plan to invite all of my old friends, and we will drink and dance together for three days and three nights."`
`"......I do also plan to invite Kinzo's family, of course?`
` You too, if you wish.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"......So let me get this straight.`
` Since you'd lost your power, for a long time, you couldn't summon them."`
`"...And your magic power has been recovering gradually, so you've become able to summon more and more monsters.`
` Is that what you're trying to say?"`
`"It is as you say.`
` You have managed to avoid taking that final step off the cliff,`
` but your heart is already wavering, and you are unable to deny that I am a witch.`
` That wavering in your heart has slightly restored my power as a witch."`
`"So are you saying that creepy butler appeared...`
`...because I started to surrender?"`
`"That's right.`
` Bit by bit, you are surrendering to me...!`
` You submitted to me so much in the last game that you received all of that humiliation, did you not?"`
`"Your back was truly pleasant for throwing my feet up on, I'll have you know.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"...D‐`
`......dammit.......`
` ...I thought that, as long as I didn't accept you, I'd be able to keep on going.`
` ...But it seems apparently I was mistaken."`
`"That's right.`
` The closer you get to submitting, the more the game will swing in my favor.`
` Isn't chess the same?"`
`"In the process of cornering each other's kings, we have traded several pieces.`
` It is true that I have yet to corner your king."`
`"......However, you have your hands full just enabling your king to escape, and have lost several important pieces to me, and conceded a large advantage.`
` It is only natural that further advances will lean in my favor."`
`"..................Damn........."`
`"As we continue, you will probably still succeed in frantically avoiding my checkmates, if nothing else.`
` ...However, as you do, I will steal your important pieces from you one by one.`
` In the end, you will have lost everything but your king, and you will receive a true checkmate, from which you will be denied any form of escape."`
`"......You were talking big last time, weren't you?`
` Something about how, since you would never accept me, this would be eternal torture that would torment me.`
` Only witches who have reached the endless level can talk about eternity.`
` You have never possessed that qualification.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*, hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!!"`
`"Kinzo‐sama has already publicly displayed the location of the hidden gold within the epitaph under my portrait.`
` The rules apply equally to all who can read the epitaph.`
` If you discover the gold, I shall return everything to you."`
`"Tonight, I ask that you enjoy your battle of wits with Kinzo‐sama to the fullest.`
` I sincerely pray that this night will be both intellectual and elegant.`
` {nobreak:—{f:5:Beatrice} the Golden}."`
`When Maria finished reading the letter that {f:5:Beatrice} had handed her, everyone was at a loss for words for a while.`
`And then, they all broke the silence at once...`
`"R‐Ridiculous.`
` What a worthless, vicious prank!"`
`"I agree wholeheartedly.`
` There is no way that Father would give up the Head's Ring.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` Ha!`
` What a transparent prank, hoping that bringing up that name will have us running around like headless chickens."`
`"Come on come on, who's the one behind this dessert packing a little too much punch?`
` I'll applaud and admire you if you come clean now.`
` Rosa?"`
`"O‐of course not...!`
` I wouldn't pull a prank assuming Father's name!"`
`"Then Aneki?!`
` Aniki?!"`
`"Me?!`
` Don't be absurd!`
` It was you, wasn't it?!`
` Only you could plan something this vulgar!!"`
`"Are you trying to mock me?!!`
` I'm the one who wants to question you!`
` Who is behind this ill‐natured prank?!"`
`Krauss beat the table and stared at everyone.`
`...Since that included the children too, he scared them greatly...`
`"...A letter from a mysterious person who claims to have been given full rights to Father's assets.`
` And if you think about how this family conference is all about discussing that,`
` ......I think it's too hasty to call this just a prank."`
`"I wouldn't be so sure.`
` It really might be one of Father's vulgar pranks...`
` He might've planned this to shock us a bit, since we've been discussin' the distribution of his inheritance without him..."`
`"If Dad was the one who planned this,`
` ......then we can't take what Maria‐chan just read aloud as a joke, right...?"`
`"......That's right.`
` If you interpret the contents literally, ...then this is a test from Father.`
` The epitaph of the witch has been displayed in the hall for quite some time now, so that any one of us could solve it.`
` There was plenty of notice.`
` So he's saying that the first person to solve it will be handed the headship along with all of his wealth, right...?"`
`......See? Our magic worked......`
`"Ridiculous, there is nothing of the sort!!`
` It is an unshakable fact that my husband will become the successor to the Ushiromiya family headship!!"`
`"This letter is the very thing that shakes it!`
` This letter is a message from the person who was given full rights to {i:all} of Father's wealth!"`
`"Nii‐san's right to become the head has returned to a blank slate.`
` The person who solves the riddle,`
` ......the person who finds {f:5:Beatrice}'s gold will become the next head of the Ushiromiya family!!"`
`"Ludicrous...!`
` Are you going to trust the meaningless words in that letter?`
` That the seal was the real thing?`
` How can we possibly trust that!!"`
`"Then let's try going to ask Father directly!`
` We aren't at the level where you can get away with saying that his mood's bad or that he's not feeling well, you know?!"`
`"The sealed wax clearly shows that this letter was from Father's representative!`
` If you doubt that, then show some proof, Nii‐san.`
` Prove that this letter is not an expression of Father's wishes!!"`
`"V‐very well.`
` It is just as you say.`
` It no longer matters whether Dad's in a good mood or not...`
` Let us go up and ask him directly."`
`"Let's do it.`
` We'll ask Dad directly.`
` Dad is to blame too here, why did he have to choose such a roundabout way?`
` Well, that is a little like him!"`
`"I, I wonder if it's alright to talk like that, taking it for granted that it is Father's letter..."`
`"Stupid Rosa!!`
` Isn't it obviously Father's letter?!`
` That letter was Father's!!`
` Isn't it obvious that he's giving the four of us an even chance to become the successor?!!"`
`"Idiot, die, you useless woman!!"`
`Rosa really is dumb.`
` Why doesn't she just give up and die forever...?`
`"I, I'm sorry...!`
` Th‐tha‐that's right...`
` I'm sorry..."`
`In the beginning, the adults had all doubted the authenticity of the letter,`
` but after just now realizing that this was a once‐in‐a‐lifetime chance for the three siblings other than Krauss in the struggle for the inheritance, Eva had changed her position, and had claimed that the letter was authentic.`
`Rudolf and Rosa also realized that, and agreed.`
`"Good gracious!!`
` How could adults like you take such a worthless prank this seriously...!`
` Even though I am not Father, I understand well his exasperation!!"`
`"Whoa whoa whoa whoa!`
` Natsuhi‐san, won't everythin' be fine if we just ask Father...?!`
` Everything'll be fine if Father simply mentions that he doesn't know about the letter!"`
`"Nii‐san.`
` Take responsibility, and just get him to say that he doesn't know about the letter.`
` This isn't a time to get scared just because he's in a bad mood, you know?!"`
`He's still scared of Father at his age, what an idiot.`
` Why doesn't he just give up and die forever...?`
`"R‐right!`
` Let's get this situation painted in black and white.`
` He's probably eating in his study right now.`
` I think it's time we had him rest his chopsticks for a moment...!"`
`"It's decided.`
` Let's go!`
` Kyrie, wait here for a while.`
` We'll go to check whether it's true or not and come back quickly."`
`"......Thank you.`
` I will wait patiently for Gohda‐san to bring the dessert."`
`The four siblings, Natsuhi, and Hideyoshi all stood from their seats forcefully and flew out into the hallway with a clatter.`
`Afterwards, the only ones left were the children, stunned completely speechless; Nanjo, who looked uncomfortable;`
` and Kyrie, shrugging her shoulders.`
`Maria, who had been at the center of all this turmoil, looked a little scared at the adults' sudden change.`
`...However, judging from her appearance,`
` she didn't look like she realized the full significance of what she had just read out.`
`"...What in the world......was that all about...?`
` I don't friggin' get it..."`
`"......Shitheads, every last one of them.`
` Do they really want the inheritance that much...?!"`
`"............Everyone,`
` this is our parents' problem.`
` It has nothing to do with us.`
` So you mustn't worry about it."`
`"Yeah, if only it was that easy...`
` ...They were so blatantly..."`
`"I thought they were better than this...!`
` Showing off their greed...!"`
`"Uu!`
` Everyone has to believe together we'll be happy!`
` Uu‐uu!"`
`"...That's right.`
` We all did promise.`
` Come on, Battler‐kun, Jessica‐chan, you too..."`
`"............Haah."`
`"......I feel like crap..."`
`We couldn't accept it at all, but we laid down our arms for the time being.`
`...We had known vaguely how filthy the family conference was going to be this time.`
` ...However, after that six‐year blank, I couldn't help being shocked...`
`Seeing that the children were completely dejected, Doctor Nanjo cleared his throat uncomfortably.`
`"...It's an adult discussion.`
` It has nothing to do with all of you young people.`
` Let us forget about it."`
`"I would if I could, okay...!"`
`"I know that it's hard on you.`
` But please, forget it for now, for their sakes."`
`"...All of your parents are fighting frantically to make your futures just a little brighter.`
` Please, don't look at your injured parents with those cold eyes when they come back."`
`".....................`
` Even on your request, Kyrie‐san,`
` ......that's a hard one."`
`"If we could be that cut and dried about it,`
` ......we wouldn't be kids in the first place....."`
`"Uu!`
` Everyone happyyy!!`
` Can't get daaaark!!`
` Belieeeeve!`
` Unless we all believe we can be happy, the happiness will get away!`
` We all have to believe!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"......That sounds good.`
` I'll believe too.`
` We can be happy."`
`"Uu!`
` Auntie Kyrie, thank you!!"`
`"Battler and Jessica onee‐chan, you believe too!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} is always saying that magic won't have any power if you don't believe.`
` Uu!"`
`Kyrie‐san rose from her seat quietly, went over to Maria, and crouched down so that their eyes met.`
`"......Uu.`
` You believed, Auntie Kyrie.`
` Now, Battler and Jessica onee‐chan have to believe."`
`"They're both strong people.`
` They'll feel better soon and do that for you."`
`"Yeah."`
`"More importantly,`
` ............I want you to tell me."`
`When Kyrie‐san said that, Jessica, George‐aniki, Doctor Nanjo and I all listened closely.`
`...It looked like our parents' minds had been filled by thoughts of Grandfather and the inheritance problem,`
` but we wanted to ask Maria about something simpler.`
`"Uu?`
` What?"`
`"Who gave you that letter, Maria‐chan...?"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}!!"`
`"The witch drawn in that portrait...?"`
`"Uu!`
` She gave me this letter and an umbrella!`
` And she used magic to fix my rose that was broken!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} is an awesome witch who can do anything!!"`
`"............Could you tell us about it in a bit more detail...?"`
