`"KyaaaaaAAAAAAaaaaaAAaa!!!"`
`Jessica's piercing shriek rang out.`
`...But that was just because Jessica's scream was the loudest.`
` ...The same thing spilled out of Battler and George's mouths as well...`
`Eva, just like Natsuhi, spread her arms, and with a terrible expression roared at the kids.`
`"George, take everyone and return to the mansion!!!`
` Quickly!!`
` Right now!!"`
`When Natsuhi had spread her arms, I had thought that she was trying to prevent us from advancing any further.`
`...However, right now, that wasn't why Eva was spreading her arms.`
`.........Because her right arm is obviously doing something behind her back...`
`What is she hiding there?!`
`"......Is this some kind of joke? Is it...?!"`
`{p:1:Yes}.`
`...I had seen this kind of cheap scene all too often.`
`{n}In manga, TV, anime, movies,`
` and visual novels about crickets that won't be released for 20 years, I had seen it over and over again...`
`This was just, just seeing something appear in real life that I had seen plenty of times before in some of those more sensational movies, wasn't it...?!!`
`That alone shouldn't...`
` Aaaaah,`
` but that, that suit,`
` ...it's that old bastard's, isn't it...?`
` I get it, then that's Uncle Krauss...`
` And Kyrie‐san, and Auntie Rosa, uwooOOOOOOoooooOOo!!!`
`"Dad, DAD!!!"`
`"You mustn't, Jessica!!`
` You mustn't go in!!`
` You mustn't look!!!`
` Especially Gohda, he's REALLY ****'d up."`
`"Dad, Dad!!`
` HyyaaaaaAAAAAAa!!!"`
`".........Rigor mortis has set in across the entire body...`
` ......Probably,`
` at least six hours have passed since death...`
` As far as I can tell by looking at the damaged area, there is a high probability that they were murdered by half-naked demon girls..."`
`"......No, I must watch what I say...!`
` I'm a fat old man, and girls are outside my area of expertise...!"`
`"......I'm hungry."`
`Aunt Natsuhi caught Jessica in her arms and Auntie Eva caught George‐aniki,`
` ......so I was the only one who could approach the entrance to the storehouse.`
`............Aah,`
` ...if only there had been someone here to catch me too,`
` ......I wouldn't have needed to have this horrible, evil scene burned into my eyes...`
`......No, that's not it.`
`...I'm standing here, not because the people who would catch me aren't here...`
` {i:but because the people who would catch me are all sticky and gross, aren't they!!}`
`...Just as Jessica had said, it did look like a storehouse used to keep gardening tools and corpses and stuff.`
`A lawn mower with extra blades,`
` a grass sickle and a hammer,`
` a saw and Houjou Teppei's left arm...`
` Piled up potted plants and bags of that shit you feed plants with.`
`And treated just the same, the corpses of several people had been laid to rest there.`
` No, had been thrown in there!`
`I could tell them by their clothes.`
`......That old bastard and Kyrie‐san.`
` ...Uncle Krauss and Auntie Rosa.`
` ......Further back, ...Gohda‐san and...`
`there's still more of them?`
` How many people died...`
` ......Fucking hell, I can't even count them on one hand, god fucking dammit!!!!!!!`
`...Although Grandfather could do it with his feet, right?`
` Damn him...`
`I didn't know whether it had been one of these gardening tools, which if used for something other than their intended purpose could definitely be wielded with a naked brutality,`
` ......wait, that just sounds wrong...`
`Better not let Beato hear me say stuff like that.`
