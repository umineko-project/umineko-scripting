`"Welcome to Rokkenjima.`
`"............Hello.`
` My name is Furudo Erika.`
`"............Who is that?"`
`"......Oh, that is the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}-sama."`
`".........Good morning, everyone.`
` .........Oh, ......what a wonderful magic circle."`
`"Behold...`
`...the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old......?"`
`"I see.........the epitaph..."`
`"Did you know?`
` In mystery novels, they call things like these epitaph murders "plotline murders".`
`"......All it takes is the presence of this magic circle,`
` and a deduction like this becomes trivial for Furudo Erika.`
`"......?! Krauss-sama! The chain on this room is also set...!"`
`"A locked room.`
` .........<Good>.`
`"So is this really.........{f:5:Beatrice}-sama's doing......?"`
`"Indeed.`
` I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`"Exactly. Of course there's no way {f:5:Beatrice} is real."`
`"Uu, she's real!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} is real!"`
`"It's magic, it is magic!!`
`".........Do you even have a heart?"`
`"A heart?`
` What's that?"`
`"Yes, we shall.`
` Dlanooooooooooor!!"`
`"{p:1:I will not allow a hidden door to exist in this {f:5:room}.}"`
`"{p:2:Suppose there existed a method X that could lead someone to the second floor of the guesthouse without passing through the lounge!}`
`"It's because this is the mystery genre.`
` {p:1:Knox's 3rd: It is forbidden for hidden passages to exist.}`
`"{p:1:It's useless.}`
`".........You think you've shut me in with this alone?`
`"Respected Sirs, I beg to inform you of the following.`
`"Respected Sirs, I beg to inform you of the following!`
` Be advised that {p:1:the windows were all locked}!`
`"An encounter with me is equivalent to your {f:5:demise}.`
`......What is that? ......Duct tape??`
`".........Yes,`
` all of those violate the rules of a proper mystery.`
`"This world is a game that is possible to explain with humans.`
`"{p:2:This is the one exception.}`
`"‘Without love, {ruby:bugs:it} cannot be seen’.`
`"People live for the sake of love!`
`"Oh, how great is the power of love...!`
`Inside the case, ......there were two of them, ancient, like the kind used many centuries ago...`
`"............"`
`"The thing you came here to hear...`
` ...It's the "truth" that I've reached, is it not?"`
`"......My lord.`
` Perhaps the time has come to speak of it."`
`«I speak English.»`
`«......I'm happy too.`
` You always call me Beatrice.`
`"......Am I somehow different...`
`...from the {f:5:Beatrice} you all were expecting?"`
`There I stood......along with another me.`
`"The VIP room...`
`is never to be entered at two in the morning,`
`"......What is this, an offering or something?`
`Someone came running towards me.`
`"R-run away...`
` W-we'll...we'll all be killed!!"`
`"......I came back for revenge.`
`"Wh-who are you...?!"`
`"......Don't tell me, that clock......"`
`"W‐we don't have any more time, Nee-san...!!"`
`"What do you think you're doing with that gun, Nee-san?`
`"That idea provides the most logical explanation for the Rokkenjima mystery.`
`".........Let it be heard.`
` I am one yet many.`
`"......The truth can betray you sometimes.`
`"That darkness is the world of witches!`
`".........<Eva>... ...<Ushiro>......<Ushiromiya>...`
` ......Ushiromiya Eva...!"`
`"Don't worry. I'll help you through.`
` Let's give it our all together,`
` okay?"`
`"AAAAAaaaaannnggeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"`
`"Then let us begin, Ange.`
`{a:c:{p:8:Choose a slice of cake}}`
`{a:c:{p:8:Choose a slice of cake}}`
`"Okay. Thanks, Auntie Eva...!"`
`".........You're lying......`
` ......You're lying......lying...!!`
`"Don't try to understand.`
` You'll just get a headache."`
`"......Beatrice is a woman to whom Grandfather owes a great debt.`
`".........You don't know about the witch {f:5:Beatrice}?"`

`{p:8:Maid control help}`

`"{p:42:All of us servants were together the whole time.}"`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
`"Illusions...to illusions.`
` ......The promised reaper lowers the curtains on the tale regardless of the witch's will."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...... Yes, it is. {p:41:You used magic to create a golden flower petal inside an overturned cup.}`
`It was...a mountain of gold ingots.`
`"......What a pitiful person......`
` I see that you've never truly loved someone..."`
`"Come, Furudo Erikaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`"Entertain me, Bwattleer-shwaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnn!!!"`
`"......If you do, you'll end up like me. .........For the sake of love, a woman should be willing to kill at least once in her life.`
`"I killed her...`
`"Well, you know,`
`"......Come ooon, ......look...`
`"Unnggg......ggnhh......!!"`
`"I find you to be truly interesting, child of man.`
`".........No. ......I want you to think.`
` I want you readers to think too."`
