` ...There's no way I'll ever come to a place like this again.`
` Kanon sighed for about the zillionth time that day.`
`As he did, the lighting changed, and the standing audience started cheering.`
`Looking around, I realized that there were suddenly a large number of people here.`
`{n}And unlike earlier, they were all guys.`
`With this huge crowd, I couldn't even see the stage.`
` Fortunately, there was a fallen beer case nearby, so I tried using that as a footstool.`
`And I noticed that there was now a new group on the stage.`
`The leader was Milady.`
` She had changed into stage clothes, and was even holding a guitar.`
` ......I didn't know she could play.`
`No, maybe she could.`
`{n}I have seen her practicing air guitar before.`
`Natsuhi‐sama wouldn't approve of any hobbies outside of study.`
`Maybe she was always practicing in secret.`
`...Come to think of it, she's been returning really late from school recently, hasn't she?`
`...Maybe she's been practicing at school, far away from Natsuhi‐sama's prying eyes.`
`It really is for the best that Natsuhi‐sama didn't come.`
` ...If Milady were to get scolded by Natsuhi‐sama after putting so many hours of practice in, she would probably be very dejected...`
`"""Jessie‐samaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"""`
`"Everyone, thanks for gathering here todaaaayyyyyyyy!!"`
`I could hear Jessica‐sama's forceful voice through the speakers.`
`...Jessie‐sama?`
` Maybe that's her nickname at school.`
`The students in the audience kept calling out that name.`
`{n}...I was a little aggravated by that inferior name, which was inappropriate for Milady.`
`Jessica‐sama was in great spirits as they kept calling her Jessie‐sama.`
`...They were all probably her fans.`
`{n}With her mike performance, she was responding to that and firing the place up.`
`{n}...It was almost like a song program on TV.`
`............At first, I had thought all this was frivolous, but that feeling now changed into appreciation—this was pretty incredible in its own way.`
`Kanon had never listened to music of his own free will, but he had often heard the kind of music that the people of the Ushiromiya family liked.`
`...Since that was almost all classical music, Kanon had naturally started liking classical music too.`
`...So to Kanon, the songs Jessica and the others were singing were...how should you say it...`
`.........very modern.`
`In any case, I thought that if Natsuhi‐sama heard it, she would probably faint.`
`But everyone looked like they were having a really good time.`
`The die‐hard fans, who had even brought pen‐lights, sang along,`
` dancing crazily with the exact same movements, almost as though it had been planned ahead.`
`On the stage, Jessica‐sama also sang enthusiastically, dripping with sweat.`
`.........He couldn't find a single element that was appropriate for a daughter of the Ushiromiya family,`
` ...but it looked like she was having a lot of fun.`
`"""Jessie‐samaaaaaaaa!!`
` Jessiiiiie, Jessiiiiiiiiiiie!!!"""`
`"Again, today, behind me, the sound of footsteps!`
` Oyashiro-sama is stalking!`
` Curses, disappearances,`
` sacrifices, torture,`
` Onikakushi, do you eat it?!`
` Don't say Marisaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`...I couldn't keep up with the atmosphere, but...`
`......anyway, Milady was full of life and looked like she was having a great time.`
`As I looked at Milady having a great time, I thought...`
`Isn't this what Ushiromiya Jessica is really like?`
`...Don't I know better than anyone just how badly life on Rokkenjima kills your own sense of self?`
`Then the time she spends, ...not as Milady, the successor to the Ushiromiya family,`
` but as a single girl called Jessica, living life to the fullest, must be very important to her.`
`...I worked close to Milady, saw her in all seasons, and I thought I knew everything about her.`
`...But that was only a single limited side of her, Milady of Rokkenjima.`
