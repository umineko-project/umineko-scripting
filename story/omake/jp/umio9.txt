`Long time no see, traveler.`
` We are pleased to congratulate you on completing the second half of {i:Umineko no Naku Koro ni}, {i:~Nocturne of Truth and Illusions~}.`
`This was a long journey for all of us—and for the project.`
`For some, it was even their first chance to delve into the world of Umineko, and our desire was to make it possible to enjoy the game to the fullest.`
`Saying goodbye is not an easy thing, especially after so long.`
` Every story eventually meets its end, and we have now reached the point where it is only a matter of time before these words lead us to the last page of the epilogue.`
`Starting with excuses is boring,`
` but we shall say sorry for releasing another omake after promising in Rondo not to indulge in that anymore.`
`Also, red truth:`
` {p:1:we did not miss our internal deadlines by more than...}`
`{n}Kihihihihihi. Not telling.`
`Once the story is available to the public it becomes simply unimportant how long the process took.`
`Umineko is a story with a surprisingly deep attention to detail.`
` This is true across all dimensions of the work, whether textual, visual, or auditory.`
`For example, it is likely that everyone remembers Erika's duct tape.`
` To seal the room, it had a notable inscription with two names:{n}E.Furudo and {f:5:Frederica Bernkastel}.`
`This one is easy to spot, but several others might be much less noticeable.`
`Without a doubt, Chiester troops are a bold addition to the game style.`
` All that military outfit, orchestra instruments, English flag bandages.`
` If you check their firing system backlog, you will even notice some Greek letters.`
`This, however, is not Greek, but rather a different language written using the Greek alphabet.`
` In the original, it is Japanese converted to "romaji", and in our port, it is English.`
` Incidentally, the TV series used Russian text for their own reasons.`
`Have you ever tried to read that blurry text below the Act titles in the Episode 7 play?`
` Older readers of the PC original will probably remember that it contained some key moments from each part.`
`This is not the case in the PlayStation release, as the text there contains phrases written in romaji:`
`{n}— umineko no nakukoroni tiru (Umineko no Naku Koro ni Chiru){n}— higurasino nakukoroni mo aruyo (We have Higurashi no Naku Koro ni as well){n}— uminekoha misuteri ka fantaji (Is Umineko a mystery or a fantasy)`
`{n}It is your turn to decipher the rest.`
`Porting a game is a straightforward process.`
` Observe the original, recreate what you see, do not mess up.`
`That's how we expected it to work.`
` But in the end we had to translate, adapt to a different platform, be ready for limitations and all kinds of issues.`
` We constantly had to make tough decisions on what to include or not.`
`Do we want trophies? Should lips sync with the speaker? How are log and navigation supposed to work? How can we control the game from a touch screen?`
` That's what we asked each other all the time, and our goal to provide the closest experience possible to the original came along with the little ways of improvement we could provide.`
`It is sad to repeat this again, but we continued to fight with an enemy during the whole development process.`
` This enemy called censorship cut several lines, references, and story parts.`
`Where narration permitted, we recovered original dialogue. Where original recordings existed on the disc, we catalogued them and put them back in.`
` Sometimes we added grimoire entries.`
` We are not proud of the quality of our audio work, but in the end we mostly restored the origins of Kinzo's child in Episode 7, and we also restored Battler's disappointment at the end of Episode 2.`
`When you pay full attention to the scenes, you always notice something.`
`It was funny enough to discover that literally all game releases so far did not include a fair amount of curses {f:5:Bernkastel} gives to Erika after her failure.`
`The part where she calls her comical and pathetic was printed in the manga, but for some reason it wasn't enabled in the games.`
` Fortunately for us, the speech was recorded.`
`If we try to remember, there were several moments where fate was pretty unfortunate to several characters, Erika in particular.`
`Imagine everyone talking about shutters when somebody forgot to draw them.`
` Consider a sequence of colourful effects at the moment of triumph when somebody forgot to port half of them.`
`We really hope that we spotted all the places with {f:5:Beatrice} portraits from the wrong epoch or clocks with misdrawn numbers.`
` Some of our testers should certainly get extra points for their attention.`
`Sometimes it was even funny.`
` We spent about a week to make it possible to walk in the mansion.`
` That's when we realised that several backgrounds are not connected or have contradicting elements.`
`Do you remember Episode 6, Dawn of the Golden Witch?`
` If you are in the mood, try to find the truth in 10 seconds:`
`a. Kanon was alive when the game was suspended.{n}b. Kanon died on the first twilight.{n}c. Kanon died on the second twilight.`
`The right answer is "c. Kanon died on the second twilight".`
`{n}Yet, if you check the ending scroll on PlayStation, you will see that he is believed to die on the first twilight.`
` At least they killed him :)`
`Now with the joint release being announced for the next generation game consoles, we hope for two things.`
`{n}That at least least some of the problems get fixed.`
`{n}That a new team continues our work with the released content.`
`{n}That was mean, but we have always believed in fantasy.`
`In fact, their release plan must have been a long story.`
` Almost all resources from Rondo were also present in Chiru, and from the script it was obvious that a single copy of the game was intended to include all eight episodes at a certain point.`
`They even reworked the credit roll for Episode 1, despite being unable to include it.`
` All that was really helpful, and we wish them luck in all future endeavours.`
`{n}{p:1:We are first to capture the flag}, however!`
`Enough of the sentiments.`
`{n}It is really the end.`
`Thank you for all your support, for your reports, for your patience.`
`Soon we will join our families to celebrate the winter holidays.`
`{n}Soon this project will become our past.`
`{n}Hope you liked it.`
` Goodbye!`
