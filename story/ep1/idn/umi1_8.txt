`Surat aneh yang telah dipercayakan sang penyihir kepada Maria menghapus semua kenangan tentang makan malam dari benak kami. `  
`Maria terus-menerus dibombardir pertanyaan oleh Bibi Rosa dan para orang tua lainnya... `  
`dan makin kesal karena mereka tidak mau mempercayainya. `  
`Kalau kami anak-anak mencoba ikut campur, mereka mungkin akan mengabaikan kami. `  
`Orang tua kami semua tampak sangat bergejolak, saling menembakkan argumen soal emas dan pembagian aset sampai benar-benar lupa kalau kami ada di sana. `  
`...Aku sudah menduga mereka sering bicara seperti ini di balik layar, `  
`tapi aku tidak mengira mereka akan seblak-blakan itu. Itu benar-benar mengejutkan kami para anak-anak. `  
`...Dari apa yang berhasil kami curi dengar, semua orang tua ingin uang lebih banyak secepat mungkin. `  
`Bolak-balik tentang warisan Kakek. `  
`Bolak-balik tentang bagaimana emas akan dibagi kalau ditemukan. `  
`Tentang uang muka dan uang tunai. `  
`......Itu sangat menjijikkan, sampai-sampai aku hampir tidak sanggup melihatnya, meskipun salah satunya adalah ayahku. `  
`...Sepertinya Jessica juga merasakan hal yang sama. `  
`Kami bangkit dari tempat duduk tanpa diminta dan pergi ke tempat yang jauh dari orang tua kami... `  
`".........Aku mengerti sekarang. `  
`Sekarang aku benar-benar paham kenapa Kakek benci turun untuk makan. `  
`Aku benar-benar kecewa pada orang tua kita saat ini! `  
`Semua omongan soal uang dan warisan itu! `  
`Bagaimana mereka bisa bersikap seperti itu begitu terang-terangan?!" `  
`"Yah, aku sudah benar-benar kecewa dengan si brengsek tua itu. `  
`Tidak mungkin aku bisa berpikir lebih buruk lagi tentang dia. `  
`Ihihi!" `  
`"I-Itu persis sama denganku! `  
`Tapi, ...itu benar-benar mengejutkanku. `  
`Mengguncangku sampai ke dalam-dalamnya..." `  
`Jessica menunduk, frustrasi. `  
`...Dia memang sering bicara soal betapa buruknya orang tuanya, tapi mungkin sebenarnya dia tidak pernah merasakannya sedalam ini. `  
`Betapa dalamnya keterkejutannya sangat terlihat jelas. `  
`"...Kalian semua masih di bawah umur dan masih ditanggung orang tua, jadi mungkin kalian belum mengerti, `  
`......tapi mendapatkan uang itu bukan hal yang mudah atau indah. `  
`Aku tidak akan memaksakan kalian untuk memahami sekarang, karena kalian masih anak-anak. `  
`......Tapi meskipun begitu, aku ingin kalian sadar bahwa orang tua kalian hanya berusaha sebaik mungkin dengan cara mereka sendiri." `  
`"......Wah, `  
`George-aniki sekarang jadi dewasa banget." `  
`"George nii-san, aku tahu kau sudah bekerja keras sebagai anggota masyarakat yang sebenarnya, `  
`......tapi apa itu berarti kau akan berubah jadi burung pemakan bangkai rakus dan tidak tahu malu seperti orang tua kita saat mulai bicara soal uang dan aset...?" `  
`".........Kalau hanya demi keuntungan pribadiku, maka tidak, aku tidak mau jadi seperti itu. `  
`Tapi, kalau keluargamu, pegawaimu, bawahanmu, dan keluarga mereka semua bergantung padamu, ...kadang kau harus bertarung." `  
`".........Aku benci pertarungan macam itu. `  
`Omong kosong soal warisan Kakek itu bikin aku ingin muntah." `  
`Jessica pura-pura meludah dengan keras. `  
`...Reaksi keras itu menunjukkan betapa dalamnya luka yang ia rasakan. `  
`"...Ayo hentikan pembicaraan ini. `  
`Semua soal emas tersembunyi Kakek, harta dan warisan adalah urusan orang tua, bukan urusan kita." `  
`"Aku setuju. `  
`......Paling tidak, aku rasa anak-anak punya kewajiban untuk bersikap bijak dan tidak ikut campur saat orang tua mereka sedang berbicara." `  
`"......Tch. `  
`...Kedengarannya membosankan..." `  
`Semua orang tahu ungkapan "Orang dewasa itu kotor", `  
`...tapi sekarang kami telah melihatnya sendiri, dan itu sungguh mengejutkan kami. `  
`George-aniki sekarang sudah bisa dibilang dewasa, dan aku sendiri sudah lama kecewa dengan ayahku, jadi aku tidak terlalu terkejut, `  
`......tapi Jessica sepertinya sangat terpukul. `  
`Ternyata dia menerima pukulan yang lebih besar daripada yang aku kira. `  
`.........Dia memang selalu bicara buruk tentang orang tuanya, tapi sepertinya di dalam hatinya dia tidak pernah benar-benar berubah. `  
`...Bahkan sekarang, dia masih gadis berhati murni dan lembut yang tidak bisa meragukan orang lain. `  
`Aku yakin dia menghormati orang tuanya sama seperti orang lain menghormati orang tua mereka. `  
`......Kemudian orang tuanya mulai ribut dan berteriak, “Uang, uang, warisan, warisan, uangku!” `  
`di depan para orang tua lain dan anak-anak. Tidak heran dia begitu terpukul mendengarnya... `  
`"...Jessica-chan, `  
`tolong jangan membenci ayah dan ibumu. `  
`......Aku tidak akan memaksamu untuk memahami mereka, tapi setidaknya jangan membenci mereka." `  
`"Aku tahu, biarkan aku sendiri dulu...!!" `  
`Enam tahun lalu, aku mungkin masih akan mengejek Jessica bahkan setelah dia terlihat sedih, `  
`......tapi kurasa aku memang sudah sedikit tumbuh selama enam tahun ini. `  
`Aku sadar bahwa saat ini lebih baik membiarkan Jessica sendiri... `  
`Jessica tiba-tiba memalingkan wajah dengan kesal dan keluar dari ruang duduk. `  
`...Mungkin dia ingin sendiri untuk sementara waktu. `  
`Aku hanya bisa memandangi punggungnya yang menjauh tanpa berkata apa-apa... `  
`"......Ngomong-ngomong, ke mana ya Maria-chan pergi." `  
`"Dia mungkin lagi cemberut di depan potret." `  
`Maria benar-benar mengagumi para penyihir, dan dia mengira bahwa bisa bertemu langsung dengan {f:5:Beatrice} dan menerima surat sebagai buktinya... `  
`akan mengejutkan semua orang dan membuat mereka senang. `  
`Namun, para orang dewasa malah meragukan keasliannya, terus menyerangnya dengan pertanyaan dan menolak menerima ceritanya. `  
`...Bahkan aku bisa membayangkan betapa sakitnya hal itu bagi Maria. `  
`Kami tidak bisa bicara pada Maria maupun Jessica. `  
`...Pada akhirnya, George-aniki dan aku hanya menyerahkan diri pada suara hujan yang terus jatuh di malam yang gelap... `  
`"Aku penasaran bagaimana kondisi topan itu sekarang. `  
`...Mungkin ada beritanya di TV." `  
`George-aniki mulai berjalan ke sudut ruang duduk tempat televisi berada. `  
`Dia tidak memanggilku, dan aku benar-benar tidak peduli topan itu sekarang sedang berada di mana di laut. `  
`Jadi, tanpa ikut ke televisi, aku berjalan mondar-mandir dekat jendela. `  
`"......Anginnya tidak terlalu kencang di sini, tapi aku penasaran apakah di laut sudah mengerikan. `  
`Aku memang dengar ada peringatan badai hebat di ramalan cuaca." `  
`"Ah, Kyrie-san. `  
`...Sepertinya diskusi besar para orang dewasa itu berjalan lancar, ya?" `  
`Sepertinya dia menangkap sarkasme itu. `  
`Kyrie-san mengangkat bahu. `  
`"...Aku penasaran apakah perdebatan yang membuat sakit perut itu akan berlanjut sepanjang malam. `  
`Rasanya tidak akan menyenangkan." `  
`"Kalau begitu, silakan nikmati jadi burung pemakan bangkai untuk harta milik Kakek sepuasnya. `  
`...Aku merasa mual." `  
`"Aku setuju denganmu. `  
`Kalau aku bisa kabur begitu saja seperti dirimu, aku juga akan melakukannya. `  
`...Sayangnya, aku tidak bisa. `  
`Bahkan kalau tidak diizinkan bicara sekalipun. `  
`Kami para istri juga cukup berat bebannya." `  
`Kyrie-san menarik napas dalam dan tersenyum pahit. `  
`Benar juga. `  
`Mereka mungkin tidak membiarkan Kyrie-san bicara, karena dia hanya menantu di keluarga ini. `  
`Tapi tetap saja, sebagai pasangan Ayah, dia tidak punya pilihan selain tetap berada di sisinya dan mendukungnya. `  
`......Dia pasti harus menanggung tekanan mental ini jauh lebih berat daripada aku. `  
`Aku tidak berniat minta maaf, tapi setelah sadar bahwa ucapanku tadi terlalu keras, aku berhenti menyindir untuk sementara... `  
`"Jadi, bagaimana kelihatannya? `  
`Apa mereka masih saja membahas penyihir misterius, {f:5:Beatrice}?" `  
`"...Kurang lebih. `  
`Keempat saudara itu selalu bikin perjanjian rahasia tiap kali mereka kumpul untuk bahas pembagian warisan Kakek. `  
`...Sekarang mereka bilang ada orang kelima entah dari mana yang muncul dan bikin segalanya makin rumit, jadi tidak mungkin percakapan mereka jadi damai. `  
`Baru saja mereka saling menggonggong, sekarang mereka malah bikin front bersama. `  
`......Bukan cuma Natsuhi nee-san yang kena sakit kepala." `  
`Di satu sisi, mereka semua ingin dapat bagian lebih besar daripada saudara lainnya, jadi mereka semua adalah saingan, `  
`tapi di sisi lain, mereka tidak mau satu yen pun direbut oleh siapa pun selain sesama saudara, jadi mereka juga sekutu. `  
`Aku memang tidak tahu detailnya, tapi kabarnya para saudara itu sedang membahas bagaimana melindungi bagian mereka dalam berbagai skenario, `  
`membuat kesepakatan gencatan senjata dan aturan agar tidak ada yang dapat keuntungan secara tidak adil, bahkan siap membawa ke jalur hukum kalau perlu. `  
`......Fakta bahwa mereka bisa sejauh itu demi menjaga bagian mereka... begitu menjijikkan hingga mau tidak mau kau harus mengakui daya tahan mereka... `  
`"Jadi, intinya, `  
`{f:5:Beatrice} itu seperti pembunuh bayaran kiriman Kakek. `  
`...Mungkin dia cuma ingin menakuti anak-anaknya karena mereka membicarakan warisan tanpa dirinya. `  
`Ihihi!" `  
`"Siapa sih sebenarnya {f:5:Beatrice} ini? `  
`Kalau semua yang dia klaim itu benar, maka dia adalah sosok misterius yang tidak ada seorang pun yang tahu sampai hari ini, dan dia juga tahu tentang emas tersembunyi Kakek. `  
`Bahkan, dia juga dipercaya memegang Cincin Kepala. `  
`...Dia pasti sangat dipercaya oleh beliau." `  
`"Yah, jelas aku tidak percaya dia penyihir yang terbang naik sapu, `  
`...tapi tidak diragukan lagi dia seseorang yang cukup misterius untuk disebut penyihir." `  
`"Kalau saja Maria-chan bisa menjelaskan lebih banyak. `  
`......Padahal dia cuma gadis kecil, tapi mereka semua menekannya. `  
`Mereka benar-benar menakutinya, dan sekarang ada hal-hal yang tadinya bisa ditanyakan, tapi sudah tidak bisa lagi. `  
`Apa mereka bahkan pernah membaca cerita 'Angin Utara dan Matahari'?" `  
`"Yang kita tahu adalah bahwa Maria menerima surat dari seseorang yang memakai nama {f:5:Beatrice}. `  
`......Cukup pemalu juga orang misterius ini, mempercayakan surat ke Maria dan bersembunyi sampai sekarang, padahal bisa saja muncul dan bicara langsung dengan kita. `  
`Hahahahaha..." `  
`"......Hei, Battler-kun. `  
`Apa kau benar-benar berpikir orang bernama {f:5:Beatrice} itu benar-benar ada?" `  
`"Siapa tahu? `  
`Tidakkah terasa seperti nama palsu? `  
`Mungkin dia cuma perwakilan Kakek, jadi diizinkan memakai nama penyihir dari khayalannya?" `  
`"Bukan, bukan itu maksudku. `  
`Sekarang ini, total ada 18 orang di Rokkenjima. `  
`......Apa kau pikir ada orang ke-19?" `  
`Apa benar ada 18 orang penuh di pulau ini sekarang? `  
`Sambil bertanya-tanya, aku mulai menghitung dengan jariku, dan memang jumlahnya pas 18. `  
`"Apa aku pikir ada orang ke-19? `  
`......Maksudmu apa, tepatnya?" `  
`"Seperti yang kukatakan. `  
`......Orang yang meminjamkan payung ke Maria katanya bukan dari antara 18 orang itu. `  
`Jadi, bukankah wajar jika kita mengasumsikan bahwa ada orang ke-19, dan bahwa orang inilah yang meminjamkan payung itu?" `  
`"............Yah, ......kelihatannya memang begitu." `  
`"Lalu, di mana sebenarnya orang itu sekarang? `  
`Paling tidak, dia pasti ada di pulau ini saat hujan mulai turun. `  
`Dan sejak saat itu, cuaca semakin buruk, jadi pergi naik kapal itu nyaris tidak mungkin." `  
`Kalau begitu, orang itu pasti masih ada di pulau ini, bersembunyi dari hujan entah di mana. `  
`......Dan tak satu pun dari kita yang melihatnya." `  
`".........Benar juga, kita semua sudah berlalu-lalang sesuka hati di seantero mansion dan rumah tamu, tapi tidak ada satu pun yang bertemu dengan orang ke-19. `  
`...Tapi pulau ini besar. `  
`Bisa saja ada tempat lain buat berteduh selain mansion dan guesthouse." `  
`Saat itu, aku mulai menyadari ke arah mana kecurigaan Kyrie-san membawa kami. `  
`Kyrie-san sedang menyangkal keberadaan orang ke-19. `  
`......{f:5:Beatrice} adalah salah satu dari kami 18. `  
`...Dengan kata lain, dia berpikir seseorang yang sudah kami kenal sedang mempermainkan kami. `  
`"Kalau {f:5:Beatrice} benar seperti yang dia klaim, dia pasti tamu paling terhormat. `  
`Orang kepercayaan paling istimewa, dipercaya oleh Kakek. `  
`...Tidak mungkin Kakek tidak menyambut orang semacam itu dengan hangat. `  
`Dia pasti langsung diantar masuk ke mansion. `  
`Tapi kita tidak melihat siapa pun seperti itu." `  
`"Tunggu dulu, bukankah cara berpikir ini agak terlalu tergesa? `  
`Memang tidak ada yang melihat orang ini, tapi itu tidak berarti kau bisa langsung menyangkal kemungkinan adanya orang ke-19, kan?" `  
`"Mungkin saja, karena suatu alasan, mereka mendarat di pulau ini secara diam-diam dan bersembunyi sejak saat itu. `  
`......Itu yang mereka sebut Bukti Iblis. `  
`Membuktikan bahwa sesuatu itu ada itu mudah. `  
`Kalau {f:5:Beatrice} muncul di depan kita dan menyapa, maka persoalan selesai. `  
`Tapi mustahil membuktikan bahwa orang ke-19 itu tidak ada." `  
`"......Ya. `  
`Battler-kun, cara berpikirmu tidak buruk. `  
`Dalam situasi kita sekarang, tidak cukup informasi untuk menerima atau menyangkal bahwa orang ke-19 itu ada. `  
`......Tapi kalau kau putar papan caturnya dan berpikir dari sisi lain, kita bisa menyangkal keberadaan orang ke-19 dengan tingkat keyakinan yang cukup tinggi." `  
`"Memutar papan catur" adalah salah satu frasa favorit Kyrie-san. `  
`...Aku sendiri sering terpengaruh oleh kata-kata itu dan memakainya dari waktu ke waktu. `  
`Kalau kau buntu mencari langkah dalam catur atau shogi, maka dengan memutar papan dan melihat dari sudut pandang lawan, kau sering bisa melihat strategi untuk membalik keadaan. `  
`Artinya adalah membalik sudut pandang dan menempatkan dirimu di posisi lawan. `  
`"......Begini, ya? `  
`Katakanlah ada orang ke-19 bernama {f:5:Beatrice}. `  
`Orang itu pasti berhasil, tanpa terlihat siapa pun, mendarat diam-diam di pulau ini dan bersembunyi sejak itu. `  
`Mungkin dia punya alasan tertentu, oke? `  
`Kalau begitu, kenapa dia repot-repot muncul di depan Maria dan memberikan surat itu?" `  
`Itu memang sebuah kontradiksi. `  
`Kalau dia punya alasan untuk bersembunyi, `  
`maka seharusnya dia tetap bersembunyi sepanjang waktu. Tapi nyatanya, dia muncul secara terbuka di hadapan Maria. `  
`"Lalu... `  
`...tunggu, Maria sendiri yang bilang. `  
`Dia bilang penyihir itu menjadikannya <Utusan>. `  
`Mungkin karena Maria yang paling muda dan terlihat paling patuh..." `  
`"Kenapa mereka butuh seorang penyampai? `  
`Kalau mereka cuma ingin menyampaikan surat ke konferensi keluarga, mereka bisa saja mengirimkannya lewat pos. `  
`Kalau dikirim ke masing-masing dari empat bersaudara, tidak ada yang bisa mengabaikannya. `  
`Tidak perlu orang itu datang sendiri dan menyelinap menyerahkannya secara langsung." `  
`".....................Itu memang... `  
`...kedengarannya aneh juga." `  
`"Pertama-tama, kalau {f:5:Beatrice} benar-benar ada dan ingin memperkenalkan dirinya pada semua orang, maka dia bisa saja muncul langsung di hadapan kita semua. `  
`Tapi alih-alih itu, dia memilih metode samar dengan muncul lewat seorang gadis kecil bernama Maria-chan... dan hanya memberi kita kesan samar tentang siapa dia sebenarnya. `  
`Kontradiksi. `  
`Let's go a little deeper, shall we?" `
`"......She appeared in front of Maria, trying to give us the impression that a 19th person existed, and yet, `
`she still hasn't appeared before us and is hiding somewhere at this very moment. `
`Think about those contradictions. `
`......You've got to keep these things in mind when you spin the chessboard around." `
`"In short, if a person wants to leave us with the impression that {f:5:Beatrice} exists as the 19th person, what might their goal be?" `
`"......If this person wanted to hide, then they wouldn't have made their presence known. `
`And if they wanted to show themselves, they wouldn't have used the roundabout approach of entrusting someone with a letter. `
`......Which means...?" `
`"It's simple. `
`{f:5:Beatrice} is one of the 18 people. `
`That's why they want to create the illusion that there are more than 18 people. `
`...The 19th person was revealed so spectacularly. `
`If someone were to profit from this, it wouldn't be some 19th person in hiding. `
`It'd be one of the original 18 people. `
`......Of course, this reasoning is full of holes. `
`If you turn over even a few of its premises, it'll simply fall apart. `
`But I'm almost completely certain it's correct." `
`...This is starting to feel pretty creepy. `
`Someone lent Maria the umbrella and handed her the letter. `
`Supposedly, none of the 18 did this. `
`And yet, {f:5:Beatrice} was hidden among those 18. `
`What was this person planning, hiding their true form and pretending to be {f:5:Beatrice}...? `
`"I suspected it might've been Maria-chan playacting, but the contents of the message were extremely complicated, and it's hard to imagine Maria-chan writing that herself. `
`......However, I can't deny the possibility that Maria-chan is working together with someone." `
`"W-Wait a sec, ...Maria's a nine-year-old kid, right?! `
`What could she possibly be planning, and with whom?! `
`And what about her straightforward, overly-honest, obedient nature?!" `
`"Yes, I also understand what kind of a person Maria-chan is. `
`......But that's exactly why I think it's possible. `
`That girl's a dreamer who can't help but look up to and blindly accept the existence of witches. `
`So if a person appeared in front of her and claimed to be the witch {f:5:Beatrice}, Maria-chan would happily swallow it up, I think." `
`".........So you're saying that if someone disguised themselves by wearing that fancy dress from the portrait, tricking Maria wouldn't be that hard?" `
`"Of course, with that reasoning, all of us women would become the primary suspects. `
`...Anyway, who did Maria-chan encounter? `
`Learning the details of that question would be the best key to solving this riddle." `
`"...But this key has been firmly locked away inside Maria-chan's heart. `
`Everyone denied the existence of the witch without listening to her, barraging her too much with questions about who {f:5:Beatrice} actually was. `
`...She probably won't open her heart to the adults now." `
`In the dim hall, in front of the portrait of {f:5:Beatrice}, ......Maria was sobbing. `
`"......Uu-... `
`Uu-. `
`...No one believes I met {f:5:Beatrice}! `
`......Uu-...... `
`Uu-...... `
`Even though I showed them the letter {f:5:Beatrice} gave, they still don't believe...! `
`.........Uu-......u, `
`...u, `
`......hic, `
`...hic!" `
`"Anyway, Maria-chan's holding the key. `
`The key to whether {f:5:Beatrice} is one of the 18 people or a 19th person." `
`"...Maria's stubborn, right? `
`When that girl gets angry, it's pretty hard to make her feel better." `
`"Battler-kun, I think a kid like you would be better at cheering her up than an adult like me. `
`...After she's feeling better, try asking. `
`......I know you don't care about all this back and forth about the inheritance, `
`but don't you find this Western mansion mystery situation exciting? `
`Who in the world is this person who gave Maria-chan the letter? `
`...It makes your intellectual curiosity ache." `
`"You're actually pretty tough, considering you're still excited after being dragged through that endless money talk... `
`Adults can be pretty amazing." `
`I shrugged exasperatedly. `
`...But I did notice something. `
`Kyrie noticed how dejected I was after overhearing our parents' turbulent discussion... `
`and was probably trying to clear the air. `
`...At the very least, I'd recovered enough to voice my complaints. `
`......She wasn't my real mother, so I've never felt like calling her Mom. `
`...But it did make me think "she's a real adult". `
`"Hey brats, so this is where you were. `
`Kyrie, you really took your time fixing your makeup, didn't you? `
`Think I'll make a habit of going out to touch up my makeup too." `
`"I'm sorry. `
`A woman's makeup takes a long time. `
`......So? `
`How has the discussion been without me?" `
`"Hehehe, I'm sure everything was all peaceful and harmonious." `
`Kyrie-san poked the weak spot under my arm with her elbow. `
`"...We decided to take a break to cool our heads a little. `
`It looks like we'll be at it all night. `
`Makes me wanna cry." `
`His way of talking hadn't changed, but he couldn't completely hide his fatigue. `
`...I couldn't say I was sympathetic, but he looked pitiful compared to his normal, energetic self. `
`"Still, that rain's just awful. `
`I really don't wanna go back to the guesthouse. `
`It looks like Natsuhi nee-san set things up so we could spend the night here in the mansion. `
`What'll we do?" `
`"......We don't need to decide until you're done, right? `
`If you run so low on energy that you can't return to our room, then we can take them up on their offer." `
`"You're right. `
`We can think about it later. `
`......What about you, Battler?" `
`"If I stayed, I'd just get in the way. `
`I'll be nice and go back over there." `
`".........I see. `
`Will you go back soon?" `
`"I dunno. `
`It'd be lonely to head back by myself. `
`I'll gather all the kids and we'll head out." `
`"Okay. `
`You go do that. `
`............Also, Battler, `
`you won't be going to sleep that easily tonight, right?" `
`"Yeah, I'll probably be up talking with the cousins. `
`Sounds like we'll be up all night. `
`Is there a problem with that?" `
`"......I see. `
`If you're still awake when the adults' discussion is over, I want to have a little talk as a family." `
`"...A what? `
`That doesn't sound like you." `
`Apparently, Kyrie-san was thinking the same thing. `
`"What are you talking about?" `
`She asked him in a small voice. `
`...It looked like Kyrie-san didn't have a clue what Dad meant either. `
`"......I also want to talk to you about it, Kyrie. `
`......I'll tell you later, so don't ask now. `
`Please." `
`"..................?" `
`I don't know anyone who neglects the concept of "family" as much as this old bastard. `
`...And now he's saying we're gonna have a talk as a family. `
`......Both Kyrie-san and I couldn't help but get wide-eyed. `
`"Don't look so terrified. `
`I'm the one who should be terrified. `
`............After all......" `
`At that point, he swallowed his words for an instant. `
`...Even though putting on airs of importance wasn't much like my dad. `
`"...You're freaking me out, Dad. `
`Everyone in our family's gathered here now, right? `
`Don't make a big deal out of it and spit it out." `
`"..................I'm probably... `
`.........I will probably... `
`be killed." `
`There was a huge crash of thunder. `
`It must've been really close. `
`Dad's expression, brightly illuminated by the lightning, was burned into my eyes. `
`Dad's face, which always looked so sure of itself and which always wore a taunting expression, `
`......was strangely frail in a way I couldn't really explain. `
`...It was so worn out that he looked like a different person. `
`"Wh-What...?! `
`...What are you talking about?! That doesn't sound like you!" `
`"*giggle* `
`I agree. `
`What happened? You look so timid all of a sudden. `
`It's not like you." `
`".........I'm gonna go fix my makeup too. `
`Don't follow me." `
`Dad turned away, weakly. `
`After that, only Kyrie and I were left, still wide-eyed. `
`"What did he say......? `
`Tonight, he'll be killed? `
`You don't think that mysterious letter scared him, do you? `
`He's been watching too many serial murder movies." `
`"............Hmmmmmmmm." `
`Kyrie-san didn't answer my lighthearted words...and continued to stare at my dad's disappearing back... `
`"...Battler-kun, when you told Rudolf-san to spill the beans right away, he left without telling us anything. `
`Even though he said he had something to say to both of us, he didn't answer you. `
`Why? `
`...Spin the chessboard around. `
`.........What do you see?" `
`"Well, when he said he wanted to talk but then couldn't, that's a contradiction. `
`...What, can you see something by looking from Dad's perspective?" `
`"......*giggle* `
`Yes, I can see something. `
`He wants to talk about something. `
`However, he doesn't have the courage to bring it up. `
`So he actually means "chase after me, talk to me, and ask me about it yourself." `
`By saying "Don't follow me", he actually means the opposite. `
`He actually means "Follow me and force me to answer." `
`......Seriously, what a spoiled brat." `
`"Whaaaa-?! `
`Can you really call that reasoning?! `
`Th-That's ridiculous." `
`"Heheheh, can great private and police detectives deduce the emotions and feelings between men and women? `
`They can't, right? `
`Figuring out the feelings of the opposite sex is an even more advanced art than exposing the tricks in difficult crime cases. `
`If you ask me, romance novels have much deeper mysteries than masterpiece mystery novels." `
`"I-I see. `
`Is that how it is......" `
`"I'll stand alongside that spoiled brat. `
`......He normally loves to bluff, but tonight, he's completely tired out from that heated discussion. `
`He probably wants someone to lean on at the moment. `
`And responding to that need is the role of his partner." `
`"Haah. `
`Sounds passionate. `
`Then I'll leave that old bastard in your hands." `
`"Yes, leave it to me." `
`I called out to Kyrie-san's departing back. `
`"......Huh? `
`What?" `
`"Um, I wanted to say thanks. `
`Thanks to you, my gloomy mood has cleared up a lot." `
`"That's good. `
`Communication is important." `
`After answering with a wink, Kyrie-san followed after Dad... `
`Natsuhi could be found in a dimly lit hallway. `
`Now and then, the thunder would crash, but this had no effect on Natsuhi's expression. `
`......She looked completely worn out. `
`The discussion that had just taken place between the relatives in the dining hall was repeating itself inside Natsuhi's mind... `
`{f:5:Beatrice} had proclaimed that in addition to the gold, all of the inheritance and property of the Ushiromiya family would be given to the person who could solve the riddle. `
`...In other words, she planned to undermine the absolute guarantee that Krauss, as the oldest brother, had to succeed the Family Head. `
`Originally, the other siblings had absolutely no chance to inherit the Headship. `
`To them, this "proposal" by {f:5:Beatrice} was extremely desirable. `
`It was obvious that they would accept it. `
`...There was no need to play some clumsy detective game. Natsuhi knew that this so-called 19th person, {f:5:Beatrice}, couldn't exist. `
`Naturally, {f:5:Beatrice} was nothing more than a fictional character used to pass a message that Kinzo had written himself. `
`As proof, Kinzo had remained stubbornly neutral as to that letter's authenticity. `
`......He was completely ignoring these reckless claims that he shouldn't be able to ignore: that he had given up the Head's Ring. `
`............In short, Kinzo had wordlessly admitted that the letter held his own message. `
`Most likely, one of the servants had given Maria the letter. `
`Kinzo had probably worked out an elaborate plan where the dress from the portrait would be prepared, `
`......and someone, probably Shannon, would be made to wear it and deliver the letter and the umbrella. `
`By doing that, he could make it seem like the witch from the portrait actually existed. `
`...No, if anything, that alone was proof that Kinzo was behind all this. `
`In that case, ......it was the same as Kinzo trying to butt in on the siblings' private discussion. `
`Then Kinzo, by announcing that he'd give everything to the person who solved the riddle, could weaken Krauss's overwhelming advantage. `
`.........Now it was certain. `
`Kinzo had eavesdropped on the siblings' discussion in the parlor earlier that day. `
`So he had known how Krauss had staved off the attack by the other three, `
`and to make the scales of the battle go back into balance, he had sent out this strange letter, which benefited Krauss's rivals. `
`He was trying to push this crazy theory so that Rosa, who had a weak position among the siblings because of her age, would join with Eva and Rudolf. `
`Then, with a three-to-one advantage, they'd be able overwhelm Krauss yet again and make their ridiculous theories get accepted by force. `
`...And by doing that, he gave them the power to resettle what had once been a nearly decided conflict. `
`They had now started repeatedly pressing Krauss to pay them a large amount of money... Using the condition that all of the siblings would guarantee Krauss's position as the Successor, talk about advance payments was being brought up again despite having been rejected once. `
`Of course, even without the story about the hidden gold, the Ushiromiya family's store of wealth was vast. `
`That store of wealth alone was more than enough. `
`Even if the hidden gold was buried forever along with Kinzo's death, there would be more than enough to satisfy. `
`Therefore, even if they weren't that interested in the gold itself, `
`Kinzo had managed to instill the lifelong fear that, on the off-chance that someone found the gold, that person would be granted the Headship. `
`And this kind of Achilles' heel would definitely be taken advantage of by someone sooner or later. `
`The only person with this fatal weakness was the Successor, Krauss. `
`......The other siblings had found... `
`no, they had been told by Kinzo about something that only Krauss could lose, and they had thoroughly taken advantage of that. `
`...Natsuhi, as Krauss's only ally in his painful position and as his wife, wanted to fight alongside him. `
`She kept trying to explain to him that the existence of the gold itself was a farce and that there was no need for him to compromise. `
`Krauss had always told Natsuhi. `
`He had told all of the siblings. `
`He always, always said that the hidden gold was nothing more than an illusion created by Kinzo. `
`Therefore, Natsuhi had believed it as his wife, and had supported her husband on that foundation. `
`Even so, Natsuhi's words didn't reach Krauss. `
`...Even though Natsuhi had fought so hard and had lent all of her strength, he continued to fight by himself and was trying to compromise with the other three siblings... `
`Natsuhi sadly and weakly wondered why she could not be of use to him, then started getting angry. `
`It had happened when everyone decided to take a short break to cool their heads. `
`Natsuhi had flared up against Krauss. `
`Enraged, she had asked why she could not be useful to him. `
`......He had then told her that he wanted to talk about something...and invited her into a room that she was normally not allowed to enter. `
`That room had been sealed with a heavy-looking padlock, and just looking at it had given her an uncomfortable feeling... `
`"There's no need for you to worry about anything said by those three, or even this suspicious person who calls herself {f:5:Beatrice}!! `
`After all, the gold is just a ruse created by Father. `
`There's no way something like that could be found!! `
`Your position as the Successor is a solid fact. `
`What are you afraid of?!" `
`Krauss removed the padlock on the door. `
`He then motioned for Natsuhi to enter. `
`"Enter." `
`"...Wh-What is this?" `
`"There's something I want you to see. `
`......I've never shown you this before." `
`Natsuhi timidly opened the door with a dubious expression on her face... `
`It was pitch black. `
`She searched for a switch to turn on the lights, but since this was her first time in the room, she didn't know where it was. `
`Krauss entered behind her, pushing her in, and when he closed the door before turning on the lights, the two were swallowed up by the darkness. `
`Only the sound of Krauss locking the door rang out through the dark. `
`"Wh-What are you doing...? `
`Th-The lights..." `
`"I am turning them on now. `
`Wait." `
`Just as he said, when Krauss pushed a switch on the wall, a flickering light turned on and lit up the room. `
`"...............Th- `
`That is......?" `
`Natsuhi had her breath taken away. `
`The room had no windows, and at a glance, it appeared to be empty. `
`In the middle of the room, a small, round table had been set, `
`and the lights brightened only that table, as if it were the leading part in a play. `
`On top of the table, a red tablecloth of elaborate design had been set out, covered with dust, `
`......and on top of that, "something" about the size of a grown man's arm had been set down. `
`......That something took Natsuhi's breath away. `
`"It's a gold ingot of incredible purity. `
`Without this, no one would have believed in the Legend of the Gold." `
`It was an ingot of solid gold. `
`Even in the faint light, it sparkled with a noble and dignified glint... `
`"This is not a proper ingot. `
`I don't even know whether it was cast inside or outside the country." `
`It took a high level of skill to make the purest of solid gold ingots. `
`And in order to verify that purity, it was standard to have the original foundry and the name of the bank that guaranteed it imprinted on the gold. `
`...However, this ingot did not have that kind of seal. `
`.........This mysterious gold bar had come from an unknown foundry. `
`"Look here. `
`............There's nothing to be afraid of. `
`It's just a bar of gold." `
`Natsuhi, following Krauss's words, timidly approached the ingot... `
`"Right there." `
`Krauss pointed at the surface of the ingot. `
`...Natsuhi concentrated on that section... `
`"...............!!" `
`Right there was the thin imprint of the One-Winged Eagle crest! `
`Natsuhi's breath was taken away once again. `
`"That's right. `
`This is the legendary ingot that Father said he received from the witch, that the president of Marusoo witnessed and was allowed to select at random to take back with him, `
`that gained the trust of the fixers in the business world. `
`I had to use all possible means to find it. `
`......I found it before the other siblings could." `
`"...How could...... `
`...Then, `
`...the legend of Father's gold is......" `
`"It actually exists. `
`...The gold that Ushiromiya Kinzo received from {f:5:Beatrice} actually exists." `
`"Impossible......! `
`...S-So, it really does exist......" `
`Natsuhi was shocked... `
`Krauss had always said that Kinzo's gold was just a fabrication. `
`So she had believed it, as his wife. `
`However, the reality was different. `
`Since he held definite proof, he had been more certain than any of the other siblings that the Legend of the Gold was true. `
`Because of this, Krauss was deeply frightened at the possibility that someone other than himself would find the gold he'd failed to find, costing him everything. `
`......But to Natsuhi, this truth was more than enough to split open her heart. `
`She had thought that, as Krauss's wife, she should be his closest confidant, which was why she had selflessly supported him. `
`...And yet, he had hid this fact from her until today. `
`......Why? `
`"......Ha‐ `
`Have I been... `
`so undeserving of your trust...?" `
`".........I didn't mean it like that. `
`It was only that there was no need to mention it." `
`"Is, `
`Is that all a... `
`...a wife `
`means to you......?!" `
`"Calm down... `
`Becoming passionate easily is one of your bad habits." `
`"You're the one who's making me like that, aren't you?!!! `
`I've been supporting you as a wife ever since I married into this family...! `
`For your sake, I threw away the family I was born into, `
`and I've been offering up my heart and my body to serve you...!! `
`And in return, `
`...this is what I get......?! `
`How could... `
`......How could you......?!!" `
`Krauss grimaced, looking annoyed... `
`His expression effectively communicated how much he disliked this part of Natsuhi, even if he didn't say it out loud... `
`"...It doesn't look like... `
`I will be of any use to you anymore......" `
`"Hmmm, that's fine. `
`......I can resolve the troubles with the siblings by myself. `
`I don't need your help." `
`"That's wrong!! `
`This is the Ushiromiya family's problem! `
`It's true that I am not permitted to wear the family crest on my body! `
`But I am still your wife!! `
`Even so, ...are you saying I'm not capable of helping you...?! `
`Are you...?!!!" `
`"......I especially wouldn't want to risk getting you involved. `
`It would probably make your headaches even worse than they are now. `
`Take a rest for today. `
`The siblings will deal with the siblings' problems. `
`It has nothing to do with you. `
`That is all." `
`A dull headache tormented Natsuhi... `
`No matter what medicine she took, no matter what scents she burned, it wouldn't heal. `
`...In fact, simply wandering alone through the dark corridors and listening to the sound of the rain seemed to be a better cure... `
`......I may be Natsuhi, `
`...but I was never Ushiromiya Natsuhi. `
`I have been despised and treated as a borrowed womb...and insulted when I couldn't even fill that role... `
`Even so, I have tried to properly perform my duties as a wife, `
`...but now, even my husband has rejected me. `
`I've done my best raising my daughter, as if it were the last job left to me... `
`...However, I've had no release for my anger and sadness, and they've caused me to subconsciously strain that relationship too... `
`Because I've been excessively strict in Jessica's education, she dislikes me thoroughly. `
`She despises me for having no interest in anything but grades. `
`......There is no longer... `
`...anything I can do for the Ushiromiya family...... `
`No, `
`...that's no good. `
`Despite it all, I must help my husband and beat back the schemes of the other greedy siblings. `
`The Family Head won't be around much longer. `
`Eventually, Krauss will succeed the Head. `
`And the next Successor will be Jessica. `
`......Strictly speaking, the man who enters the family by marrying Jessica will become the next Head, but it all comes to the same thing. `
`...I have to make Jessica an excellent Successor whom everyone will accept as worthy to take over the Ushiromiya family. `
`In the days to come, that greedy Ushiromiya Eva will probably be plotting to find some fault with the main family, `
`and if all goes as she plans, Jessica will be dragged down from the succession, with George set up in her place. `
`......It is regrettable, but George is a man, and even more, has matured as a person. `
`...Compared to Jessica, who is right in the middle of her rebellious period and whose grades are slightly below average, it can be seen at a glance who is more fit to succeed the Head. `
`So in order to secure Jessica's position, I need to turn her into an excellent person. `
`After doing that, ......I want to find her an excellent husband worthy of the excellent person she will have become. `
`......A wonderful man who will truly accept Jessica...and stay with her through all of life's joys and sorrows. `
`Was Natsuhi.........trying to entrust her daughter with fulfilling some desire of her own? `
`Natsuhi thought back to the days when she'd had no choice but to marry into the Ushiromiya family, because of that unavoidable fate... `
`She had tried to block that from her memory. `
`......She had consciously forgotten it...and had actively attended to the life she'd been given as Ushiromiya Natsuhi... `
`And in so doing, she had built up a new life. `
`......But...just now, `
`...it felt like all of that had been casually rejected. `
`"............ `
`How should I think as I live my life? `
`......I do not know." `
`Natsuhi helplessly rested her head against the glass of the window... `
`The glass, which was cool thanks to the raindrops beating against it, felt somehow refreshing. Even though it should have been emotionless, ...right then it seemed to be the only thing that could understand Natsuhi... `
`At that point, even if someone had appeared, Natsuhi didn't intend to pay any attention to them. `
`......But she did pay attention. `
`......Because it was her beloved daughter. `
`"......O- `
`Oh, it's you, Mom. `
`What the heck are you doing in a place like this? `
`Thought you were a ghost..." `
`Just like always, her words were rough and not at all like a girl's. `
`...Instinctively, words of rebuke rose to Natsuhi's throat. `
`......However, their strength gave out and they didn't escape her lips. `
`".........Jessica, `
`forgive me, but my headache is awful. `
`Please leave me be." `
`"......I see......" `
`Jessica was seeing her mother in a position of feebleness for the first time, so she was considerably disconcerted. `
`Until just now, she'd been filled with contempt for all of the parents, including her mother. `
`...But now, those feelings had been completely swept away. `
`......Her mother's utterly exhausted face had wiped them all out. `
`In its place, the words George had told her floated back up in her mind. `
`Our parents are doing their best in their own way. `
`...And because their families are counting on them, they can't afford to keep everything pleasant...and have a heavy responsibility to fight. `
`......Maybe her mother had been standing around in this dimly lit hallway...because no one had tried to understand that in her... `
`Jessica hated her mother. `
`...So, she had no intention of speaking kindly to Natsuhi just because she was looking a bit frail... `
`So when she attempted to speak kindly to her mother anyway, she had to clench her fists and gather up the words from deep in her heart. `
`"...I-It sounds like you've really got your hands full with that meeting thing..." `
`".........It has nothing to do with you. `
`Please go somewhere else." `
`"......Is your headache bad? `
`Sh-Should I go get some medicine...?" `
`"......You don't have to trouble yourself. `
`...Please, leave me alone." `
`Natsuhi wasn't being cold. `
`...She just wanted her daughter to go far away so that she wouldn't have to bump against Natsuhi's own short temper. `
`......But there was no chance that Jessica would realize this. `
`"...............O-Okay." `
`Jessica hung her head, looking sad. `
`...Seeing that expression, Natsuhi recognized the kindness that Jessica was trying to muster. `
`She gave her head a small shake to drive away her own unkind feelings... `
`"Then I'll......leave. `
`...I'll be with the other cousins, so I don't get in the way of the adults. `
`.........See you later..." `
`".........Wait there." `
`She called Jessica, who was trying to leave and looked lonely, to a stop. `
`"......What...?" `
`"......Thank you for being so considerate. `
`......It isn't good of me to go to sleep and leave you alone." `
`"D-Don't talk like that, you'll bring bad luck..." `
`"...I've made you worried, `
`but I'm okay now. `
`......I will go." `
`If I let my daughter see me this feeble any longer, I'll only make her feel more uneasy. `
`...With that thought in mind, Natsuhi left Jessica with words of gratitude and made to depart. `
`......This time, Jessica called out to her mother's back. `
`Natsuhi stopped and turned around, asking what business Jessica had with her. `
`But Jessica herself didn't know why she'd stopped her mother, `
`...and for a while, she smiled wryly, muttering to herself as she hesitated over what to say. `
`She was poking around in her pocket when her hand touched something, and she took it out. `
`"U-Um, hey, Mom! `
`I, uh, was given a charm today. `
`What was it, a charm against magic? `
`Umm, err, ......I'm pretty sure that...you were supposed to hang it from your doorknob, I think. `
`Ahahaha, ...I forget... `
`There's no point in me having it, `
`...so I'll let you take it." `
`It was the scorpion charm that Maria had given her on the beach. `
`Although she'd heard of its various effects from Maria, Jessica's mind had gone blank, and she was just barely able to say even that much. `
`Jessica, thinking that her mother probably wouldn't accept it anyway, immediately drew back the hand she had stuck out, grasping the charm. `
`......So when Natsuhi came back to take it, she was extremely shocked... `
`"............What is this? `
`Some kind of prize toy...?" `
`"W-Well it's...I think it's something like that... `
`I guess you wouldn't really expect a charm that looks like a toy to do anything......" `
`But her mother took the charm from where she grasped it in her hand. `
`"Thank you. `
`I'll take good care of it. `
`............Sometime soon, in exchange, why don't I give you a charm that was important to me when I was a child?" `
`"...I-It's not like that's why I gave it to you. `
`......But, well, `
`......if you really say so..." `
`"Then I will rest for now. `
`My headache is awful. `
`.........Try not to stay up too late." `
`"Sure..." `
`Natsuhi put the charm in her pocket and turned away. `
`......She then disappeared into the dark hall... `
`"...It seems the weather will be like this all day tomorrow after all." `
`"Dang, this makes the good weather we had earlier feel like a lie." `
`George-aniki and I were killing time in front of the parlor television. `
`At that point, Jessica returned. `
`Her face was still blank, but it looked like she'd calmed down a little since we'd last seen her. `
`"......Is Maria still in front of the portrait?" `
`"Nope. `
`She just came back, and she's sleeping over there on the sofa. `
`It's getting pretty late for her, after all." `
`Looking at the clock, I saw it was a little past 10:00 PM. `
`...Even if we were planning to stay up all night, it was about time to head back to our room. `
`"Well, my Mom did have a room prepared for us in the mansion. `
`...What'll we do?" `
`"I'd rather head back to the guesthouse. `
`......Going by what we saw of our parents, I think it'd be better if we weren't in the mansion." `
`"I agree. `
`Feels like they're telling us kids to mind our own business and stay out of their way. `
`Let's be good little boys and girls and do that." `
`As we were talking about this, Aunt Rosa came into the parlor. `
`She was looking all over restlessly, probably trying to find Maria. `
`"Aunt Rosa, if you're looking for Maria, she's over there on the sofa." `
`"Thank you. `
`My, she's out cold. `
`......We must move her to a bed." `
`"If you'd like, I'll carry her over to a bed." `
`"Thanks, that would be wonderful. `
`......Are you all heading back to the guesthouse? `
`Or are you going to stay in the room Natsuhi nee-san had prepared here?" `
`"We were just talking about that. `
`We'd just decided to head over to the guesthouse." `
`"I see. `
`Then could I ask you to take Maria with you? `
`...I'd feel much more reassured if she stays with all of you cousins." `
`Behind those words, she seemed to be concealing some regret that the adults, herself included, had deeply hurt Maria's feelings... `
`"Leave it to us, Aunt Rosa. `
`After all, we do have an expert at comforting Maria with us!" `
`"A-Are you talking about me? `
`I couldn't do it myself. `
`We'll need everyone together." `
`"That's right. `
`Battler, weren't you the one who hit it off with Maria when you were messing around earlier?" `
`As we said this, Aunt Rosa smiled, looking truly happy. `
`"Thank you, everyone. `
`......It looks like our meeting will last until very late. `
`So while I'm sorry to burden you like this, I'll be counting on you all to take care of Maria." `
`"Hey, Maria, are you sound asleep...? `
`We're going back to the guesthouse." `
`Maria muttered something indistinct, rolled over, and fell back asleep. `
`......It looked like she was sleeping deeply. `
`"She's really out cold. `
`I'd hate to wake her." `
`"Right, I'll carry her." `
`Maria's body was much lighter than it looked. `
`I lifted her up and put her on George-aniki's back. `
`It was raining hard outside, and Aniki couldn't hold an umbrella and carry Maria at the same time. `
`It looked like Aunt Rosa would come with us as far as the guesthouse to help out. `
`However, when she heard Uncle Krauss's voice call out to her, she had no choice but to return. `
`"......Now that's a problem. `
`I have to go back now." `
`".........Is everyone returning to the guesthouse?" `
`After we left the hall on the way to the entrance, the door to the servant room opened and Shannon-chan stepped out. `
`"It has grown very dark, so allow me to guide you." `
`"That would be great, Shannon-chan. `
`George-kun is going to carry Maria there. `
`Could you hold an umbrella for him?" `
`"Yes, certainly." `
`Shannon-chan brought umbrellas for each of us and a flashlight to guide the way. `
`As we opened the front door, the downpour was quite terrific. `
`It looked like we wouldn't have any spare time to take a pleasant walk and enjoy the nighttime rose garden... `
`"Aniki, is she too heavy? `
`Want me to carry her?" `
`"It's okay. `
`I can at least carry Maria-chan." `
`"......I'm truly grateful. `
`Please take care of Maria." `
`"Sure, you got it. `
`Then I guess this is goodnight, Aunt Rosa." `
`"Then I will see them over there and return here." `
`"Yes, please..." `
`Aunt Rosa watched us leave. `
`"......Maria, `
`......I'm sorry for everything..." `
`Rosa's mumbling voice didn't reach the person in question, nor any of the kids, but disappeared beneath the sound of the rain...... `
`After cutting through the rainy rose garden, we arrived at the guesthouse. `
`"Ahh, if only I'd applied for the position of Maria-carrier! `
`Then I would've gotten a chance to have Shannon-chan's huge boobs rubbing all over my arm!" `
`"Th-Th-Th-That's not why I did it, it's a misunderstanding...!" `
`"I-I thought that if I didn't walk like this, George-sama would get all wet........." `
`"C'mon, quit babbling and go in!" `
`After being urged on by Jessica, we folded up our umbrellas and went into the guesthouse. `
`"Has anyone gotten their clothes wet? `
`I can bring some towels if you want..." `
`"You don't need to worry about us that much. `
`Thanks, Shannon-chan." `
`"Ah, that's right. `
`We were planning to play cards or something. Would you care to join us for a bit?" `
`"Huh? `
`Who had the night shift on today's schedule?" `
`"I believe we had a special schedule during the family conference. `
`Also, I think a few alterations have been made, so I will go and check......" `
`"Wait, if you have to go all the way back to the mansion to find out, don't force yourself." `
`"Oh, that's all right. `
`I can find out from the servant room in the guesthouse. `
`...Please excuse me for a short while." `
`Shannon-chan gave a quick bow and went into the guesthouse servant room. `
`The rest of us headed for the cousins' room and decided to put Maria to bed for the time being. `
`Maria was sleeping very deeply, and there was absolutely no sign of her eyes opening... `
`For now, we'd get some soft drinks out of the room's refrigerator and drink those while playing cards or something... `
`"......Oh, `
`Kanon-kun? `
`And you're here too, Genji-sama. `
`...What has happened with tonight's shift...?" `
`"............Krauss-sama has given an order. `
`He made some sizable changes to the shift schedule." `
`"......Indeed. `
`Gohda-san now has the night shift at the mansion. `
`Shannon and Kanon have the night shift in the guesthouse. `
`Kumasawa-san and I have been ordered to sleep in the guesthouse... `
`Just now, a phone call came, saying that once you arrived, you were also to remain here for the rest of the night." `
`"Huh...? `
`Th-That certainly is a sizable change... `
`The shifts at the guesthouse and the mansion have been completely reversed, haven't they...?" `
`Originally, Shannon and Kanon had been assigned the night shift in the mansion, while the night shift in the guesthouse, where all of the relatives were staying, had been assigned to Gohda, who had an abundance of experience in entertaining. `
`Kumasawa should have been sleeping at the guesthouse, while Genji should have been sleeping in the mansion. `
`However, it seemed that Krauss had suddenly ordered that the schedule be modified. `
`......The shifts at the guesthouse and the mansion had all been reversed, and Genji was spending the night in the guesthouse. `
`"............It's probably because of {f:5:Beatrice}-sama's letter." `
`"...Why probably?" `
`"...After such a mysterious letter appeared, it was only natural that Krauss-sama would suspect one of us. `
`.........We serve directly under the Master, so Krauss-sama tried as best he could to keep us far away from the family conference." `
`Genji, Shannon, and Kanon were all permitted to wear the Ushiromiya family crest, the "One-Winged Eagle", as the servants who served directly under Kinzo. `
`Of course, since they were working for the Ushiromiya family, they had to obey anyone's orders, but their only boss was Kinzo. `
`Since only Kinzo held the right to employ them, even Krauss could not have them dismissed of his own accord. `
`Because of this, Krauss and the others often viewed these servants as Kinzo's underlings and shunned them. `
`And in fact, Kinzo seldom let anyone other than them enter his study. `
`This sudden shift change was probably a clear expression of the sense of mistrust that had caused. `
`Considering the time Kinzo had left to live, this would definitely be the last family conference before the problem of the inheritance came up. `
`On top of that, the mysterious letter that claimed to be from {f:5:Beatrice} had dropped in out of the blue. `
`Krauss definitely wanted to keep Kinzo's loyal subjects away from the table of such a delicate and important discussion... `
`"......If you would excuse me, I will go rest. `
`...If anything happens, call me immediately." `
`"Our company tonight is...{i:special}." `
`""Yes, certainly, Genji‐sama."" `
`Genji nodded back, went behind a screen, took off his jacket, and slowly began to relax after a day's worth of tension... `
`".........The ones who just returned now, were they the children...?" `
`"Yes. `
`The other relatives are having a conference in the mansion. `
`It looked like it would drag on for quite some time..." `
`"......Then we've got it easy. `
`It's already this late, and there's this weather. `
`The rest of the relatives will probably spend the night in their rooms in the mansion." `
`"Yes, probably... `
`I'm only saying this because Genji-sama isn't around, `
`but I'm a little happy I was sent to the guesthouse......I guess..." `
`"Oh...? `
`Why's that? `
`Because you can stay away from Madam and Eva-sama, those bullies? `
`...Or do you have another reason?" `
`"...I-It's not as though I have... `
`...a-another reason...!" `
`".........I see. `
`Then, let's do our best together with our night shift. `
`I'm counting on you, Nee-san." `
`"Ah, ......umm......... `
`Just now, I was asked to go to the children's room and play with them..." `
`Shannon hung her head apologetically, ...gazing at Kanon uncertainly. `
`Kanon didn't try to meet her eyes, and spoke curtly as he sighed. `
`It looked like he didn't plan on indulging his "sister". `
`"............You can't. `
`You were assigned to the night shift. `
`...Besides which, it isn't necessary for furniture like us to respond to an invitation to play. `
`...You understand, right?" `
`"Y-Yes, I do understand. `
`.........Nnnn." `
`Shannon's shoulders drooped slightly. `
`...She had already expected that Kanon, a stickler for rules, would say something like that, but she still seemed a little discouraged. `
`As Kanon flipped through a log book, he spoke without facing Shannon. `
`"............That means the children will be waiting for you. `
`You'll have to apologize and tell them you have the night shift and won't be able to stay with them. `
`......Go and come back." `
`"Huh, .........ah, yes! `
`I'll go apologize and come back..." `
`Shannon hurriedly stood from her seat before her brother's mood could change and flew out of the servant room after giving a quick bow...... `
`As he watched her go, Kanon took a single deep breath... `
`Genji's voice came from beyond the screen. `
`"......Kanon, `
`......I will be here, so you can go too." `
`"Genji-sama, `
`......Shannon was the only one called. `
`It's not as though I was invited..." `
`"That is only because you were not there at the time. `
`If you had been, you would have been invited as well. `
`......It is good to play as a child from time to time." `
`"......... `
`...No, such a thing is not necessary for me. `
`...Human children may have a need to play, `
`...but we are...furniture." `
`"...............Is that so?" `
`"......Nee-san is also... `
`furniture. `
`...Even if she pretends to be a person, `
`...it will only hurt her later. `
`...I understand that, so I try not to get too close to people, that's all." `
`Genji did not say anything after that. `
`......After a while, he stood up and used a pot of hot water to make powdered cocoa, serving some to Kanon as well. `
`"Is that for real?!?! `
`I had no clue...!!" `
`"Dumbass, you're too loud! `
`You'll wake Maria up!" `
`Battler was so surprised that he yelled obnoxiously and scattered his cards everywhere. `
`His voice caused Maria to turn over once, but she soon fell back into a deep sleep... `
`Jessica gave him a jab, and he lowered his voice. `
`"Still, seriously, ...now that you mention it, they really did have that kind of atmosphere, didn't they...? `
`......Haah, now I see, so George-aniki is..." `
`George couldn't be seen anywhere in the room. `
`A short while ago, when Shannon came into the room, George suddenly said that he'd forgotten something in the mansion and needed to go back and get it. `
`Shannon said she would guide him, just like she had on the way to the guesthouse, and the two of them departed together. `
`"......Well, there's actually been signs of it for a while now. `
`You know, questions about hobbies and favorite things. `
`I always thought it was a bit much for a passing interest, ...and look what's happened now!" `
`"Come to think of it, I get the feeling George-aniki's always been overly nice to Shannon-chan...... `
`Now I get it..." `
`"According to the weather report, it looks like it'll be at its worst tonight. `
`It also seems it'll last all day tomorrow, though it should get a little better." `
`"...Really? `
`Then, maybe the boat won't arrive until the day after tomorrow...... `
`...I hope that doesn't interfere with your work on Monday..." `
`"Hahaha, I already knew the typhoon would be coming beforehand. `
`Just in case, I made sure I didn't have any plans for Monday, so it's okay. `
`...I may not look it, but I really am the type who can plan ahead in his schedule." `
`George puffed out his chest, acting proud. `
`Compared to the calm appearance George always had as the oldest cousin, he now looked amusingly like a little kid. `
`Shannon chuckled at this abrupt contrast. `
`"It's no surprise you're so well prepared, as someone who'll bring prosperity to his company someday." `
`"...Well, making a company prosper really is a tough job. `
`Money isn't the only thing that's important. `
`I learned that well when studying under my father. `
`Making a company prosper is like owning a castle and leading your subordinates." `
`"My dad really loves reading about great leaders during the warring periods of Japan, a hobby that's probably influenced by the fact that he shares Toyotomi Hideyoshi's name. `
`Much of his philosophy on managing businesses comes from talking about them. `
`...Did you know? `
`Takeda Shingen, who was feared as the leader of the strongest cavalry corps in the warring periods, started out with his troops in complete disarray...and didn't have the kind of strong leadership necessary to utilize them well." `
`"Is that true? `
`That's a little unexpected." `
`"In order to unite his troops, Shingen showed his excellent leadership in many ways. `
`For example, when a soldier succeeded well in battle, he would immediately honor them with a medal. `
`Normally, that kind of thing was put off until after the war, and they were all awarded at once." `
`"He continued this diligently while on the field of battle, `
`and immediately showing his appreciation for his troops' military exploits motivated them in an extremely significant fashion. `
`Also, whenever one of his troops was brought down by an illness, he would be the first to rush up to them and care for them, and so on. `
`...Takeda Shingen wasn't just the man who led the strongest calvary corps in the warring period. `
`He was the person who cared the most for his troops throughout the warring period." `
`"......And because he was that kind of person, all of his troops went along with him." `
`The truth was, Shannon had already heard this story several years ago. `
`...But whenever a discussion of his father led to this sort of topic, George would always glow and look like he was having a great time. `
`So Shannon just smiled without interrupting, urging him to continue. `
`"Of course, in a capitalist world, money determines both your strength and the height of your fortifications. `
`But you can't build up a castle or succeed in war by yourself. `
`Such things can only be accomplished with the support of many subordinates, by borrowing their strength. `
`......After understanding this, when I look at my father's back, I realize how immature I am. `
`I can clearly see how much competition he had to overcome before building up all he has now." `
`"George-sama, you truly look up to your father... `
`I'm jealous." `
`"A-Ah, sorry, ...that's not how I meant it." `
`"I-I'm sorry, ...that's not how I meant it either......" `
`The two of them awkwardly looked at their feet. `
`Shannon had no parents. `
`She had been brought up in an orphanage owned by Kinzo, called the {ruby:Gospel House:Fukuin ({p:0:禝音}) House}. `
`Under the guidance of Kinzo, their honorary director, the orphanage offered members who excelled a chance for on-the-job serving experience. `
`If their efforts met with Kinzo's approval, they'd be able to leave the orphanage and work as servants for the Ushiromiya family. `
`...This was considered to be the highest honor for those who lived in the orphanage. `
`Servants from the Fukuin House all took names with the character {ruby:on:{p:0:音}} in them while they served. `
`So {ruby:Shannon:{p:0:紗音}} wasn't her real name. `
`The same went for {ruby:Kanon:{p:0:嘉音}}. `
`All of the members of the Fukuin House were orphans. `
`At least, they were all people who had been separated from their parents under special circumstances. `
`......Because of this, the orphans had been taught to think of each other as their only family. `
`That's why it seemed so natural to both of them when Kanon called Shannon his sister. `
`And while both Shannon and Kanon were working in the mansion today, `
`there were several other servants possessing the {ruby:on:{p:0:音}} character in their names, such as {ruby:Manon:{p:0:眞音}} and {ruby:Lenon:{p:0:恋音}}, who often worked in a rotation schedule. `
`...However, there were not many servants who stayed with the Ushiromiya family for long. `
`It was standard for them to quit after three years. `
`So you could probably say that Shannon, who had been working for ten years, was a notable exception to the rule. `
`Working as a servant for the Ushiromiya family was a heavy burden to bear, but the pay wasn't bad at all. `
`Working for a full three years would earn more than what was needed to enter mainstream society. `
`That was why, even though the orphans realized what a harsh task working for the Ushiromiya family was, they still hoped to be accepted. `
`Maybe the fact that Shannon managed to continue working for ten years...wasn't because she had more willpower than the other servants. `
`Maybe she'd gotten stuck working for ten years because she didn't have the courage to say she wanted to quit. `
`Kinzo couldn't even trust his own blood relatives, and those "excellent" servants sent from the Fukuin House were the only ones he could rely on. `
`Because of that, Kinzo would sometimes allow them to wear the family crest, as servants under his direct control, and have them work close to him... `
`"......Err, ......um, you've been working here for almost ten years now, right? `
`You must've saved up a lot of money by now." `
`"I wonder... `
`It's not like there's anything in particular I'd like to buy... `
`After all, a few million yen isn't enough to live off for the rest of your life..." `
`"So, the reason you've been working all this time wasn't to hit some target sum?" `
`".........Y-Yes, that's right. `
`......I have nowhere to go outside this mansion. `
`......And I have been getting along well with Milady and the other young servants... `
`...The Madam does scold me sometimes, ......but caring for the roses and cleaning the mansion is fun..." `
`"But that can't be your entire life, Shannon-chan... `
`no, {ruby:Sayo:{p:0:紗代}}-chan." `
`"......Umm..." `
`Shannon cast her eyes downwards when she heard her real name... `
`She understood what George was trying to say and fell silent. `
`"There's something I've learned, as I continue to study even after becoming an adult and a full-fledged member of society. `
`......A human's life is not as monotonous or short as we thought when we were kids." `
`All school-aged kids have certain fears they can't shake. `
`......They wonder whether they'll live the rest of their lives like sleepy classes after a monotonous and boring school day, `
`spending their time in a carefree laziness without anything interesting happening until it's all over... `
`However, life's only like that for underage students. `
`Compared to a human's life, the time they spend as students is nothing more than a blink of the eye, a period where they break through the shells of their immaturity. `
`The inside of the shell might be a hot, suffocating and boring world, `
`but the world beyond that shell is vast and filled with limitless possibilities. `
`"So far, your life has been trapped inside the shell called Shannon. `
`I think you're under the mistaken impression that your life will continue like this forever." `
`"That's...... `
`..............." `
`Shannon couldn't deny those words. `
`...She'd been unable to harbor any clear doubts about her lifestyle, `
`and since she never had any hope or goals for changing herself, she'd lazily continued living the way she always had. `
`...And if asked whether this life was satisfying, `
`...she wouldn't have been able to nod...... `
`She may have been intentionally averting her eyes from the truth. `
`...Without George's admonishments, she would have continued pretending not to notice as her real life slipped away bit by bit, neglected... `
`"......George-sama, `
`............is it... `
`wrong for me to continue living...this way?" `
`"Yeah, it is. `
`Oh, and by the way, didn't you break one of our rules just now?" `
`George immediately gave a strict answer, then broke out into a mischievous smile. `
`Shannon already knew what she was being chided for, ...and she hung her head again, apparently embarrassed. `
`"Didn't you promise not to use "sama" when the two of us are alone...?" `
`"......I-I couldn't obey that as a promise. `
`...But, if it was an order, I would have to obey it... `
`Because I'm......furniture." `
`"Then it's an order." `
`"Err, `
`...............yes. `
`...Certainly, `
`...George-san." `
`As Shannon hung her head, her face red, she said George's name again, this time using "san"... `
`"Yes, that's fine, Sayo-chan." `
`George smiled at Shannon...no, Sayo...to praise her small act of bravery. `
`This short exchange alone made it clear how far back their relationship must have stretched... `
`For a long while, the two talked as if the weather raging about them didn't even enter their thoughts. `
`They talked about the many memories they'd built during their relationship that no one else knew about. `
`Every once in a while, a flash of lightning would attempt to interrupt them, but this could sully neither the roses nor the time they spent blushing at each other... `
`"............Th-That's right. `
`...I have something I wanted to show you." `
`"......Wh-What could it be?" `
`George, who had been speaking eloquently, suddenly started to stutter. `
`Watching him, Shannon seemed to guess something. `
`George timidly searched through his pocket. `
`Something got caught in the depths of his pocket, and just like the stuttering George, it took a little while to get it out. `
`It was a very small box. `
`A small box covered in a deep blue velvet. `
`...That peculiar shape was enough to tell anyone what was resting inside. `
`Shannon had prepared her heart somewhat, certain beforehand that this was what he'd been planning. `
`But even so, when she actually saw it, she couldn't avoid blushing once more... `
`George opened the small box, took something out, ...and held it out for Shannon to take. `
`"I want you to take this." `
`"...I-I, umm, couldn't accept something so valuable...!" `
`"...You can't take it...?" `
`"Tha‐...that's not... `
`umm, `
`...I'm... `
`unworthy... `
`o-of such a thing......" `
`"Sayo, `
`this isn't a request. `
`...It's an order. `
`Take this ring. `
`...Okay?" `
`"Ah, ......u... `
`I-If it's an order, `
`......I cannot disobey..." `
`"Yeah, that's right. `
`...Well done." `
`Shannon, not wanting to show her bright red face, timidly accepted the ring from George's hand while still staring at the ground... `
`That ring wasn't a simple accessory. `
`It was a noble object, meant since ancient times to be offered to a special woman under special circumstances. `
`...Therefore, while George could order her to take it, he could not order anything beyond that. `
`Anything beyond that would depend, not on an order, but on Shannon's...no, Sayo's own will. `
`"So, from here on, I'm not ordering you anymore. `
`.........Sayo, `
`I want you to give me your answer by tomorrow, without using words. `
`............Do you understand?" `
`"...Err, .........h-how should I......" `
`"I won't order you any further, so this isn't an order, `
`......but a ring is something you put on your finger, after all. `
`......If you like it, you can just put it on any finger you choose." `
`Shannon had only pretended not to know. `
`She already understood what he wanted her to do. `
`...But she was standing at a huge crossroads of her life... `
`"......Look how late it's gotten. `
`Let's call it a day." `
`George turned away from Shannon, acting just a bit bluntly. `
`"I could probably order you to wear it on your left hand. `
`You might be timid and dependent enough to actually obey that kind of an order. `
`......But I want at least this last step...to be done by your own will, Sayo. `
`...Understand?" `
`"......Y- `
`Yes." `
`"So, ...that's my order. `
`.........I want you to think about it well tonight and show me your answer tomorrow." `
`"..............." `
`Shannon nodded back. `
`...Today was the culmination of their many days spent together. `
`...This moment certainly hadn't come as a surprise to Shannon... `
`".........We should be getting back to the guesthouse soon. `
`If we take any longer, we'll make everyone worry about us." `
`"......Ah, `
`......umm... `
`...I'm sorry, I...! `
`Um, I just remembered something I had to do in the mansion, so, `
`...uh, `
`......I have to go back to the mansion..." `
`"Something this late? `
`.........Really?" `
`George stared into Shannon's face as he laughed mischievously. `
`He definitely saw through Shannon's lie. `
`...However, when he saw how she felt, he could sort of understand that she might be so embarrassed that she'd want to be alone. `
`So, because George realized the meaning behind Shannon's lie, he accepted it. `
