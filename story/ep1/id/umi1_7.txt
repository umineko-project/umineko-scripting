`A news ticker popped up on top of the TV program we were watching. `
`The disaster report told how municipalities all over were continually sending out rain, flood, and wave warnings. `
`Of course, the raindrops beating harshly on the window were even more convincing. `
`"......This rain's incredible. `
`Still, when it's raining this hard, it also feels like it might stop at any moment." `
`"You wish! `
`They said the typhoon's moving slow, so it might be like this all day tomorrow. `
`And even a little bad weather stops the boats from coming." `
`"It looks like we won't be able to head out on Sunday after all. `
`...Just in case, I cleared all outside business from my Monday schedule, and I'm glad I did." `
`"Which means...ihihi, looks like we'll get to skip school Monday. `
`Living on an island's starting to sound pretty good! `
`......Come to think of it, Jessica, you've gotta take a boat to school every day, don't you? `
`What do you do when the boats stop running? `
`Do you stay home when it rains and show up late when the wind's blowing, like King Kamehameha?" `
`"If the boats don't come, I stay home. `
`Still, it's not as good as it sounds. `
`Usually, I'm ordered to study by myself, and it's not that fun with someone standing right behind you watching everything you do." `
`"During the rainy season, does the weather ever stay bad for a long time `
`and make you miss a bunch of days in a row?" `
`"That does happen sometimes. `
`Still, I'd get a call from my homeroom teacher every single day, who'd sourly guide me on how I should teach myself and what I had to turn in." `
`"She can't skip school as easily as you're imagining, Battler-kun. `
`She's got to follow the rules for people that travel to school by boat and get a good amount of studying done." `
`"It'd actually be easier to just go to school. `
`In my own room, I get distracted and can't concentrate. `
`After being made to do nothing but workbooks for several days straight, it's pretty hard to handle all that mental stress. `
`......When I get into college, I really just wanna go to some dorm and quickly say goodbye to this inconvenient island." `
`"Ah, okay... `
`By the way, what do you do when the weather's good in the morning, but then gets so bad on your way home that the boats are closed? `
`Do you spend the night at school?" `
`"That actually happens a lot. `
`Because of that, they've built some lodgings there for people who can't get back to the island they live on. `
`That's where you'd spend the night. `
`Sometimes, when it gets really bad, you can't get back home for a few days at a time." `
`"Someone commuting to school or work on a train packed to twice its capacity might carelessly think that `
`commuting by boat would be pretty interesting and fun, `
`but it sounds like it comes with troubles of its own." `
`"You hear thoughtless tourists saying stuff like that all the time. `
`I've had enough of island life. `
`I really wanna just graduate high school and say goodbye to this island." `
`"But there are all-dorm schools even for high school, right? `
`Why'd you choose that Niijima school, of all places?" `
`"I've wanted to go to one of those from the beginning!! `
`But Mom's always going on about how I need to learn manners and discipline as the Successor. `
`...So, I ended up sticking close to home even for high school. `
`Man, I hate this island. `
`I just wanna go live in a city. `
`I don't care if rain or even spears fall from the sky, as long as I can move to a city where I can wear casual clothes and sandals... `
`and can get to a convenience store in less than five minutes..." `
`"Hahahaha. `
`Hold out just a little longer. `
`Just a bit more and you'll graduate high school, right?" `
`"I can't wait a little longer. `
`Aaaaaah..." `
`Jessica stretched out and reclined in the sofa. `
`Maybe it was a bad time slot, because there weren't any interesting programs on, `
`and we had nothing to do but languidly kill time until we were called for dinner. `
`After that episode, Maria never returned to the cousins' room after all. `
`Aunt Rosa probably took her back to the mansion. `
`It had to be pretty boring for Maria, all by herself while the adults had a confusing conversation. `
`......We thought we might as well head over to the mansion to see her, but the weather really was awful... `
`and since there wasn't much time until dinner, we stayed where we were. `
`At that time, we heard the sound of a humble knock. `
`Jessica answered. `
`"Ye-s!" `
`".........The preparations for dinner are complete. `
`Please come to the mansion." `
`It was Kanon-kun's voice. `
`Did he go to all the trouble of coming from the mansion in this rain just to get us? `
`Couldn't he have just called us on the telephone? `
`...Well, I guess servants at work don't always get to take the most efficient route. `
`"Just when I was getting hungry. `
`Let's go." `
`George-aniki turned off the television and stood up. `
`"My stomach's been growling for a while! `
`I've always been a huge fan of the main family's dinners! `
`And didn't Gohda-san say it was calf steak or something? `
`Oohh, I can't wait!!" `
`"Our dinners are always even more fabulous than usual when the family conference comes around. `
`Even I'm looking forward to it! `
`Let's go, let's go." `
`As we left the room, Kanon-kun bowed silently and respectfully. `
`"Okay, let's go. `
`Is the rain pretty nasty out there?" `
`"......Yes. `
`Take care not to get your garments wet." `
`After seeing the three of us out, Kanon-kun peered into the empty room. `
`".........Wasn't Maria-sama with you...?" `
`"No, she's not. `
`Wasn't she with Aunt Rosa?" `
`Rosa was lying on a sofa in the empty parlor, having fallen asleep before she knew it. `
`...She was bearing a burden that the children couldn't even imagine. `
`That's why she only needed to let her guard down a little...before the weariness immediately dragged her into the world of sleep. `
`Realizing this, Genji brought a blanket over to her. `
`When he tried to spread it over her, her eyes snapped open as though she'd been shocked with electricity. `
`"..................ah...! `
`............ `
`......Oh, it's you, Genji‐san......thank you." `
`When she realized that the thing that had touched her was just a blanket, and that Genji had been considerately giving it to her, she let out a sigh of relief. `
`"......Did I wake you? `
`My sincere apologies." `
`"No, it's okay. `
`I hadn't planned on sleeping in the first place. `
`...What time is it now?" `
`When he was asked for the time, Genji checked a pocket watch that he took out of his chest pocket. `
`".........It is slightly after 6:00." `
`Rosa gave her head a little shake when she realized that not much time had actually passed, even though it'd felt like she'd slept for ages. `
`...Even though she didn't feel rested at all, the drowsiness that had enveloped her must've been pretty deep. `
`"Thank you, I'll be fine without the blanket... `
`I mustn't sleep at such a strange time. `
`My sense of time has been completely thrown off. `
`...............The rain... `
`has finally started pouring down in earnest, hasn't it?" `
`Rosa finally realized that the peaceful sound that had put her to sleep was actually the rain. `
`"The wind's blowing hard too. `
`...I wonder if the typhoon's finally here." `
`"......That's what they said on TV. `
`The typhoon is moving slowly, so they think it will be like this all day tomorrow." `
`"Really...? `
`.........So, our last chance to see that wonderful rose garden must already have passed by." `
`From the window, what she could see of the rose garden was completely blurred by the wind and the rain. `
`"...Maria... `
`......That's right, what about Maria?!" `
`"............I have not seen her. `
`Did she not return to the guesthouse?" `
`Rosa knew her daughter's nature well. `
`So a chill ran down her spine. `
`Maria was stubbornly honest, `
`......and if she was ordered to find something that didn't exist, she would look forever and ever. `
`......Even in pouring rain...!! `
`"......No. `
`The cousins left before I did, so Maria was alone...! `
`Unless someone told her to stop, she'd stay there even if it started raining spears! `
`Without even opening an umbrella!! `
`.........Aaah, how could I have lost control of my emotions and done such a thing?!!" `
`Even though she'd known about Maria's simple honesty better than anyone, she'd once again lost control of her emotions and done something terrible!! `
`"Mariaaaaaaa!!" `
`Rosa pushed Genji away and ran down the hall. `
`The outside really looked like a typhoon, and the rain was pouring down spectacularly. `
`Maybe because of some aspect of the terrain, the winds weren't typhoon-class, so an umbrella wouldn't be torn out of one's hands. `
`Even so, it certainly was a windy rain. `
`There was no time to admire the roses being drenched. `
`"Anyway, I'm getting pretty worried about Maria. `
`.........You don't think she's still rebelliously searching for that rose alone, do you?" `
`"...I wonder. `
`Surely she wouldn't do it in this rain... `
`or at least, I wish I could believe that, but Maria-chan sometimes gets really stubborn and intensely straightforward." `
`We hadn't worried much, thinking that Aunt Rosa had taken her back to the mansion. `
`...However, when Kanon-kun had come from the mansion to call us and thought Maria was here, we got a little worried. `
`".........I did not see her in the mansion, so I was sure she was here. `
`After all, Rosa-sama was taking a nap..." `
`"You didn't see her on your way over here?" `
`".........My apologies. `
`I opened my umbrella and ran as fast as I could, so I did not pay much attention." `
`If he had cut through the rose garden, taking the shortest line between the mansion and the guesthouse, then he would've just barely missed the place where Maria had been looking for her rose. `
`And it was raining this hard, too. `
`It certainly would've been possible for Kanon-kun to fail to notice her. `
`"Instead of arguing around here, it'd be faster to just check it out directly. `
`......Aniki, why don't we race over there?" `
`"Oh, do you think you can beat me now that you've been growing for six years? `
`Okay, let's settle this. `
`............Go!!" `
`George-aniki and I flew out into the rain. `
`Jessica and Kanon-kun followed us. `
`"Mariaaa!! `
`If you're there, answer me!! `
`Mariaaa!!" `
`"It's Aunt Rosa. `
`Hey, Aunt Rosa!!" `
`When George-aniki called back, Aunt Rosa jumped at him and grabbed onto him. `
`"Where's Maria?! `
`Isn't she with you?!" `
`"No, we didn't meet with Maria-chan after that." `
`"............Mariaaaaa!!!" `
`............Six years ago, Maria had been three years old. `
`She was a cute and pure kid who'd just accept whatever anyone said. `
`...But six years have passed since then! `
`She's nine now, and experiencing the ups and downs of life should've taught her something. `
`......But Maria, are you telling me you're still as innocent and pure as you used to be...?! `
`"Mariaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!" `
`As I circled the rose bed, something white unexpectedly turned to face me. `
`......It was a white umbrella. `
`Maria was crouching down, holding a white umbrella and still searching for that rose... `
`"............Uu-." `
`Her face, which had turned bright red from her crying her eyes out, was dirtied with water and mud. It was a truly pitiful sight. `
`"Maria, `
`......are you still looking?!" `
`"......Uu-...... `
`Can't find it... `
`Can't find... `
`...my rose...... `
`...Uu-......" `
`Maria had probably been here since the rain started pouring down. `
`Her shoulders were freezing. `
`She looked tired to the bone, but fortunately, since she was holding an umbrella, she wasn't completely soaked. `
`...The umbrella probably came from the handbag Maria always carried around. `
`......Thank goodness. `
`Seriously, thank goodness. `
`"Battler-kun! `
`Thank goodness, you found her!" `
`"Mariaaaaaaaaa!! `
`I'm sorry, I'm so sorry...!!" `
`Aunt Rosa threw her umbrella aside and hugged Maria. `
`"......Uu-......... `
`It's not here. `
`...My rose isn't here... `
`......Uu-......" `
`"I'll look for it with you later... `
`Okay? `
`So just put it on hold for today. `
`...Okay?" `
`".........Uu-... `
`Put it on hold for today......" `
`It looked like Maria still wasn't able to accept it, but she no longer had enough energy left to resist. `
`Jessica and Kanon-kun caught up with us. `
`"......I'll have a towel ready in the mansion immediately." `
`"Maria, `
`...were you here this whole time......?" `
`"I'm sorry...... `
`I'm sorry for being such a bad mother........." `
`"......Aunt Rosa, why don't we head back to the mansion for the time being? `
`If we stay here, Maria will catch a cold." `
`".........You're right. `
`Maria, let's go. `
`If we don't get you cleaned up, Grandfather will be mad." `
`"Uu-... `
`Hungry." `
`"It's already time to eat. `
`You did a good job holding out, Maria. `
`Once the weather gets better, we'll all go search together." `
`We couldn't stay in the rain forever. `
`We took Maria with us as we headed back to the mansion. `
`Maria apparently wasn't as worn out as I'd thought. `
`When she remembered we were having calf steak for dinner, she started chanting "I'm hungry, I'm hungry, uu-uu-!", and returned to her usual spirited self. `
`......Aunt Rosa didn't chide Maria for saying "uu-uu-". `
`"I see. `
`So she had an umbrella on her. `
`Maria sure is good at packing the right stuff." `
`"......Uu-. `
`I didn't bring an umbrella. `
`Uu-." `
`"What? Then how did you get that white umbrella you're holding?" `
`"Uu-! `
`I borrowed it!" `
`Some caring person must have brought her an umbrella. `
`A normal kid would look for shelter once it started raining, but Maria was too stubborn to give up so easily. `
`...So, maybe that caring person gave up on telling Maria to find shelter, then decided to at least give her an umbrella. `
`"I see. `
`I'll have to thank that person. `
`Who was it?" `
`"Uu-! `
`{f:5:Beatrice}!" `
`The name Maria cheerfully mentioned...was that of the island's witch. `
`Rosa took a deep breath and asked again, trying to do so in a way that wouldn't damage Maria's good mood. `
`"Really? That's wonderful. `
`So, who was it? `
`Who brought you that umbrella?" `
`"Uu-. `
`{f:5:Beat}- `
`{f:5:ri-ce}-! `
`Uu-uu-!" `
`Maria immediately realized that her mother didn't believe her and started crying out unhappily again. `
`So Rosa stopped pursuing the subject. `
`It'd probably be faster to ask whoever lent Maria the umbrella during dinner, rather than ask Maria herself... `
`"Father, `
`please at least join us for dinner. `
`It won't be a family conference otherwise." `
`Along with a dull pounding on the door, the sound of Krauss's entreaty could be heard. `
`However, that voice seemed to be resigned to the fact that nothing it said would be heard. `
`".........Kinzo-san, `
`won't you at least come out for dinner? `
`All your children have gathered here to see your face, haven't they?" `
`"Silence, Nanjo. `
`............So, the bishop won't work. `
`...............One move too short......" `
`Apparently, Kinzo was completely focused on the final battle of his long-lasting chess match with Nanjo. `
`Kinzo's brow was wrinkled as he continued to glare at the game board through his spectacles. Krauss's voice didn't reach his ears. `
`".........Kinzo-san, `
`I'm hungry myself. `
`Why don't we go down and eat?" `
`"Go by yourself if that's what you want. `
`Let me consider this next move for a little longer. `
`...We are going to finish it tonight. `
`............Otherwise, it's doubtful we'll finish before the world ends." `
`Nanjo rose from his seat, hoping this would prompt Kinzo do the same, but Kinzo's eyes never left the chessboard. `
`He knew well that Kinzo always displayed a blind concentration when it came to chess, `
`but he'd never seen Kinzo concentrate as hard as this. `
`...It was almost as though Kinzo was telling the truth, and there would never be another chance for them to continue their contest if they didn't finish tonight... `
`It seemed that, no matter how obstinately he called out to Kinzo, it wouldn't reach the latter's heart. `
`Nanjo gave up and headed to the door that Krauss was still banging on... `
`The door to the study opened. `
`Krauss was taken aback, thinking that maybe Kinzo was actually coming out. `
`However, Nanjo was the one who appeared, and Krauss let out a sigh of relief. `
`"......Doctor Nanjo, `
`is Father..." `
`"......I'm sorry I couldn't be of service... `
`...Right now, this room is Kinzo-san's whole world." `
`Nanjo shook his head with a completely defeated expression. `
`Krauss raised his fist once more and banged on the door, shouting. `
`"......Father, can you hear me?! `
`We're heading down now, but please join us any time you feel like it. `
`All of your children are waiting for you...!" `
`His voice was very loud, and he was making a racket pounding on the door. `
`There was no way it wouldn't reach Kinzo's ears. `
`............Well, it certainly was reaching him. `
`But he ignored it anyway. `
`However, unlike the time he'd been called down for lunch, he didn't fly into a rage. `
`......By now, Kinzo was calm at heart, ...almost as though he had taken on a philosophical view and turned himself over to fate. `
`"Neither dinner nor the faces of my children interest me in the slightest. `
`......I will only leave here if {f:5:Beatrice} is resurrected, or if I am chosen as a sacrifice for the key. `
`The Demons' Roulette has already started spinning. `
`What meaning does dinner have at this point......?" `
`As though the painfully loud banging on the door completely failed to enter his hearing... `
`...Kinzo silently thought about his next chess move, still in his philosophical state... `
`Just as always, Kinzo's figure couldn't be seen anywhere in the dining hall. `
`Krauss, wearing a bitter smile, returned with Nanjo. `
`"Father says he still is not feeling well. `
`He truly regrets missing this once-a-year opportunity to sit together with his gathered family." `
`Eva and Rudolf sniggered. `
`Given Kinzo's personality, there was no way he'd show signs of regret, `
`...and none of his relatives showed any regret at his absence. `
`"Then why don't we start dinner? `
`Gohda, begin." `
`"Certainly. `
`Well then, if you will allow me..." `
`When Gohda was told to start the family conference dinner, his biggest time to shine of the whole year, he nodded with a broad grin. `
`"......Umm, may I ask who lent Maria an umbrella?" `
`When Rosa timidly cut through the silence of the dining hall, everyone noticed. `
`"...An umbrella? `
`What's this about?" `
`"Umm, `
`...a short while back, Maria was in the rose garden when it started raining, `
`and she apparently borrowed a white umbrella from someone. I wanted to thank them..." `
`"It wasn't one of us. `
`After you left, we moved to a different room and had a "friendly" chat that whole time." `
`"Haha, ...that's right. `
`Even after that, the siblings had a real friendly chat." `
`The word "friendly" fell awkwardly from Hideyoshi's lips, `
`so even those who hadn't been present could tell the conversation hadn't been a pleasant one. `
`"At the very least, it couldn't have been me, Eva, Rudolf, Hideyoshi-san or Kyrie-san." `
`"We were together the whole time, even after Natsuhi nee-san and Rosa-san left. `
`The whole time until the meal started." `
`"Nii-san went up to the study with Genji-san to call Father. `
`At that time, the rest of us went straight to the dining hall. `
`So it wasn't one of us. `
`...Couldn't it have been a servant kind enough to lend an umbrella?" `
`"So, was it you, Gohda-san?" `
`"...I have been in the kitchen the whole time preparing. `
`My sincere apologies..." `
`Gohda looked slightly disappointed about missing this chance to show off. `
`At that time, Shannon and Kumasawa appeared, pushing a serving cart loaded with hors d'oeuvres. `
`"Then what about Kumasawa-san or Shannon-chan?" `
`"...Yes? `
`H-Has something gone wrong...?" `
`Because Shannon had come in partway, she shrank back, mistakenly thinking that the others were searching for the one responsible for some error. `
`"It isn't like that. `
`It started to rain when Maria-chan was alone in the rose garden. `
`After that, someone lent her an umbrella. `
`Aunt Rosa said she wanted to thank that person." `
`"......Uu-. `
`......{f:5:Beatrice}..." `
`Maria, her mouth a thin line, said the witch's name in a small voice. `
`Aunt Rosa explained the situation one more time. `
`As she did, Kumasawa-san cackled. `
`"Hohohoh. `
`It wasn't us. `
`Shannon-san and I were preparing the rooms together, so we did not go outside." `
`"...Yes. `
`......I'm sorry I wasn't able to be of assistance......" `
`"Preparing the rooms? `
`...What do you mean by that?" `
`"...............Because of the rain, `
`we thought it would be troublesome for all of the guests to return to the guesthouse, `
`so the servants were ordered to prepare the guest rooms inside the mansion." `
`"...Really? How thoughtful. `
`Yes, it certainly would be rude to chase us outside in this rain." `
`"Could you give it a rest..." `
`"Yes. `
`After receiving the order from Madam, ...Kumasawa-san, Kanon-kun and I started preparing the rooms. `
`...Then it became time for dinner, `
`so Genji-sama ordered Kanon-kun to go to the guesthouse and summon the children." `
`"Yes. `
`So, did Kanon-san find Maria on the way to the guesthouse and hand her the umbrella?" `
`"......Uu-. `
`Wroooong!!" `
`The person who had actually received the umbrella denied it. `
`Rosa was troubled. `
`All she wanted to do was give a word of thanks to the person who had lent the umbrella, but she couldn't find them. `
`And she'd thought asking like this with everyone gathered for dinner would work immediately... `
`"...Then, was it you, Natsuhi nee-san?" `
`"I'm sorry. `
`After everyone's "friendly" chat, my headache was so bad that I have been resting in my room. `
`Therefore, I did not go outside." `
`".........Then who was it? `
`George-kun and the kids? `
`......That can't be right." `
`"No, it wasn't us. `
`We were watching television in the guesthouse the whole time." `
`"Actually, we thought Maria had just gone back to the mansion with you..." `
`"Then Kanon-kun came, and he asked whether Maria was with us. That's when we first realized she wasn't in the mansion. `
`I mean, if it were me, I'd have grabbed her hand and pulled her under a roof before giving her an umbrella." `
`Rosa was completely baffled. `
`One by one, the relatives and the servants denied that they had done it. `
`...Even though it really wasn't something anyone would need to hide. `
`So, by process of elimination, the number of remaining candidates wasn't large. `
`"Of course, it wasn't me. `
`Right after it began raining, I visited Kinzo-san's room, and I was playing chess with him until just now." `
`"......Which means that it also wasn't Grandfather." `
`"Wait a sec... `
`Isn't this starting to get a bit weird? `
`Who's left?" `
`"Then, ...who was it? `
`...Genji-san? `
`Huh? `
`Um, wait a second, don't get me wrong. `
`It's not like I'm searching for some culprit or anything. `
`All I want to do is, as a mother, thank the person who gave Maria an umbrella in the middle of the rain......!" `
`...Giving an umbrella to a girl loitering in the rain was something to be praised, not hidden. `
`...Despite that, no one raised their hand. `
`......Why not? `
`Everyone started whispering about how strange this was getting... `
`"......Calm down, Rosa. `
`Why don't we just ask the person who was lent the umbrella?" `
`That's what everyone had been thinking since the beginning. `
`They were all scratching their heads at why she didn't just ask Maria, who had been given the umbrella. `
`However, Rosa bit her lower lip. `
`After all, she already knew how Maria would answer if asked. `
`"Of course! `
`Rudolf-kun here's got it right. `
`Maria-chan, tell your uncle! `
`Who lent you the umbrella?" `
`"{f:5:Beatrice}!" `
`The dining hall was wrapped in silence for an instant, but it was soon interrupted by a burst of laughter. `
`"Hahahaha. `
`I see, so {f:5:Beatrice}, the witch of the forest, felt pity and lent her an umbrella. `
`What a lovely story. `
`Rosa, there you have it." `
`"......Nng, `
`............nnnggg." `
`Rosa couldn't believe it. `
`...Even though she just wanted to say thanks for the umbrella, why did everything have to be so clouded in smoke...? `
`"Uu-! `
`Just like Uncle Krauss said. `
`{f:5:Beatrice} let me borrow it! `
`Uu-uu-!" `
`"Hahahahaha... `
`Isn't that wonderful? `
`We should all be jealous of such purity. `
`What do you think, everyone? `
`Hahahaha..." `
`Krauss was laughing with a face that was clearly mocking, `
`but Maria was overjoyed, apparently convinced that her claim was being believed. `
`"......How did that work? `
`Does that mean a witch really appeared and lent her an umbrella?" `
`Jessica asked me in a small voice that wouldn't carry over to Maria, who was sitting across from me. `
`"Has Maria ever been the type to make jokes?" `
`If we'd heard that kind of story pop out of my old bastard's mouth, we would've just taken it as another joke. `
`......However, it was hard to explain it away like that when Maria said it. This was getting pretty unnerving... `
`"No way. `
`She's always been frank and serious. `
`She's the sort who'd believe any joke, even ones normal people could instantly tell were lies. `
`I've never even heard of her cracking a joke." `
`Aunt Rosa probably knew that better than anyone. `
`It appeared that because of this weird situation, she had no idea what was going on anymore. `
`"So, if Maria says she borrowed an umbrella from {f:5:Beatrice}, that must mean it really was {f:5:Beatrice}?" `
`".........We're talking about Maria here, so I can't think of it as some kind of metaphor or joke. `
`...It might be best to take what she says at face value." `
`"Then what's going on? `
`Are you saying Genji-san or someone put on that fancy dress from the portrait and gave Maria the umbrella?" `
`"...I'm not sure about that... `
`Actually, that's what I want to know." `
`Jessica shrugged jokingly, but her expression didn't completely match her attitude. `
`Once the hors d'oeuvres were set out and Gohda showed off his vast store of knowledge, the meal began. `
`A couple casual chats broke out here and there, but they seemed somehow distant, and the meal ended up being so quiet that you couldn't ignore the sound of the rain sneaking into the dining hall. `
`Kumasawa and Shannon, pushing the serving cart, ran into Genji and Kanon on their way to the kitchen. `
`"...Oh, it's Genji-san. Did you lend Maria-san an umbrella?" `
`".........An umbrella? `
`What are you talking about?" `
`"Well, `
`......I heard that when it started raining, Maria-sama was alone in the rose garden. `
`...It seems she borrowed an umbrella from someone there, `
`but we don't know who it was." `
`"It wasn't me. `
`After all, I actually thought Maria-sama was in the guesthouse. `
`When Battler-sama first found her, she was already holding a white umbrella." `
`"My apologies, but it was not me either..." `
`".........Then, you don't think it was... `
`...the Master?" `
`Both in the dining hall and right here, everyone had stated that they hadn't done it. `
`...That left only Kinzo, but... `
`"Maybe he went walking down the corridor for some reason... `
`when he just happened to see Maria-sama in the rose garden without even an umbrella..." `
`"............The Master... `
`is not particularly fond of Maria-sama." `
`"I agree. `
`............I can't imagine that, for Maria-sama's sake, he'd go to all of the trouble of descending the stairs with an umbrella." `
`"Oh my, ......how troublesome. `
`Does that mean the one who lent Maria-sama an umbrella really was {f:5:Beatrice}-sama? `
`Hohohohoh..." `
`Kumasawa laughed, just like the relatives in the dining hall who had laughed it off. `
`......She couldn't think of any other way to break through the smoke veiling the current situation. `
`Just then, the crisp sound of hands clapping twice rang through the hallway. `
`They all turned around at once to see Gohda coming out of the dining hall. `
`"Okay, everyone. `
`When serving a dinner, proper timing while setting the table is essential. `
`Please immediately see to setting out the soup. `
`Genji-san, the women are in the middle of an important job, so please don't get in their way." `
`"....................." `
`Kanon glared at Gohda for being rude to Genji, a person Kanon respected. `
`Genji, realizing this, patted Kanon once on the shoulder as a warning. `
`Kanon reluctantly turned away and returned his expression to normal. `
`"......Obey Gohda's instructions. `
`Hurry and prepare the dinner table." `
`"Come now, there's no time. `
`Don't dawdle! `
`Hurry...!" `
`Gohda grabbed the serving cart from Shannon and steadily pushed it towards the kitchen. `
`"...Then please allow us to return to the kitchen. `
`...After all, Gohda-san's temper is very short, ...hohohoh." `
`"P-Please excuse me as well..." `
`Kumasawa and Shannon left. `
`Only Genji and Kanon remained. `
`Through the window, the darkness of the rainy night could be seen, along with the occasional thunderbolt. `
`"............Genji-sama, `
`did {f:5:Beatrice}-sama... `
`...really return?" `
`".........I don't know." `
`"...Shall I inform the Master?" `
`"That is not necessary. `
`.........If she truly has returned, she will eventually appear before the Master of her own accord. `
`.........Furthermore, she is a fickle person. `
`It would be pointless to report to the Master only to find that she does not appear..." `
`"...............I wonder if this means the Master's ceremony has already begun." `
`"...Probably. `
`However, that has nothing to do with furniture like us. `
`......We must continue to return the favor we received from the Master...until our final moments." `
`"......Yes. `
`...That is furniture's... `
`...duty." `
`The thunder crashed once more. `
`Except for those instants when lightning lit up the sky, nothing could be seen out the window but the darkness of night. `
`Just as humans rule when the sun is up, those that are not human rule when the sun is down. `
`The darkness of night that now surrounded Rokkenjima was ruled by another Master, not the Ushiromiya family. `
`Did this Master take pity on Maria when she was alone and being pummeled by the rain in the rose garden, lending her an umbrella...? `
`Kanon looked at the rose garden's lights, dimly visible beyond the window. `
`The dim lights weren't enough to illuminate the surrounding area. `
`Looking at those lights felt like making eye contact with the witch, and Kanon forced himself to avert his gaze. `
`...If he didn't, it felt like his eyes would be absorbed by that light...... `
`Can the weather change how people act? `
`You often hear stories about how things like atmospheric pressure can influence people's moods and physical health. `
`For some time now, everyone had been struggling to clear the gloomy atmosphere, `
`but any conversation was quickly cut off, and in the end, the dining hall was simply filled by the sound of the rain. `
`Dessert was some kind of chocolate cake accompanied by pear sherbet. `
`Gohda-san enthusiastically explained the recipe as soon as this final dish was presented, but I quickly forgot the details. `
`The guest of honor, Grandfather, was absent, the weather was horrible, and the identity of the one who'd lent Maria an umbrella remained a mystery. `
`When dinner ended, no one felt even one bit refreshed. `
`...It was too late now, but I realized painfully that taste wasn't the only important part of a meal. The whole atmosphere was also critical. `
`Gohda-san, the supposed conductor of this musical piece called dinner, did his best to enliven the place, `
`dropping little jokes left and right, but apparently not one of them succeeded. `
`After taking orders for after-dinner coffee, tea, and orange juice, he left for the kitchen. `
`As soon as he disappeared, Uncle Krauss spoke. `
`"......My, my. `
`What a waste that the dinner Gohda worked so hard to create has met with such a gloomy atmosphere." `
`".........Yes, absolutely. `
`It just feels like nothing would taste good today." `
`"Hoh. `
`I'd like to know why you feel that way. `
`Later on, I'll do all I can as your older brother to help cheer you up." `
`Aunt Eva grimaced slightly. `
`...I'd already heard she wasn't on good terms with Uncle Krauss, but it was pretty clear now. `
`When I looked around, I noticed that my father and Aunt Rosa were also grimacing. `
`Apparently, there was something besides the weather troubling all of them... `
`"......Both Aunt Eva and my Dad... `
`aren't looking too happy." `
`"Really? `
`I don't think so." `
`I asked Aunt Natsuhi, who was sitting on my right, ...but she seemed to be in a bad mood as well. `
`She snapped back as if to say she was absolutely not interested. `
`"Well, our adult conversation got a little complicated. `
`It isn't somethin' kids like you need to worry about, Battler-kun. `
`Hahahahaha, `
`isn't that right, Natsuhi-san, Kyrie-san?" `
`Uncle Hideyoshi laughed as he spoke, but without his usual brightness, `
`so I could vaguely imagine just how complicated their adult conversation had become. `
`On top of that, even Aunt Natsuhi and Kyrie-san, the people he had directed his comment to, ignored him as though they hadn't heard anything. `
`...I didn't know what kind of conversation they'd been having while us kids were away, `
`but it reminded me of how Dad said he had stomach cramps when we arrived at the mansion. `
`The family conference might've been a playful reunion to us kids, but it was definitely different for the adults... `
`After Uncle Hideyoshi's comment was ignored by the other adults and an awkward silence fell over the room, Kyrie-san spoke up. `
`"......We were talking about how the kids' careers would turn out. `
`Such as what lies in your future, Battler-kun. `
`Will you just drift on to college? `
`Wouldn't that be a little disheartening as a starting line for the long race of life?" `
`"Hey! Wait a sec... `
`Kyrie-san, if you start talking about something like that in the middle of a meal, it won't digest well and we'll all end up getting constipated." `
`"Wahahaha...! `
`That's right, that's right! We were talking about Battler-kun's and Jessica-chan's careers! `
`You've gotta think seriously about the future! `
`Wahahaha..." `
`Hideyoshi heartily agreed as if they really had been talking about that, but that was probably wrong. `
`Kyrie-san had been obviously trying to change the subject. `
`However, if Kyrie-san had determined that this was the best course of action for now, then she was probably right. `
`Taking this into account, I cast aside my suspicions as to the cause behind Aunt Eva and Dad's bad moods... `
`At long last, the serving cart returned, filled with coffee and tea. `
`Kumasawa-san and Shannon-chan served it to everyone. `
`Gohda-san then explained that this concluded tonight's meal. `
`If only the mood had been a bit more cheery, it might've been the best dinner in my life. `
`It was a shame this best of dinners couldn't have been had under the best conditions. `
`"Uu-! `
`George onii-chan, is dinner over now? `
`Over?" `
`"Yes. `
`With this, dinner is finished." `
`"Don't be rude. `
`Stay in your seat, and calmly drink up." `
`"...Uu-." `
`Maria looked like she was really excited by the occasionally crashing thunder. `
`Maybe she wanted to quickly finish eating and run over to the window. `
`She had been fidgeting for a while, waiting for the meal to end. `
`......Some people are afraid of thunder, while others find it interesting, and Maria was apparently one of the latter sort. `
`Therefore, when she heard from George-aniki that dinner was over, a huge smile broke across her face. `
`She then rose from her seat, took out her handbag—which she'd set under her seat, never having left it even while she was eating—and began fishing around inside of it. `
`No one seemed particularly concerned by this behavior... `
`".........What's... `
`that? `
`Where did you get it?" `
`George was the first to notice it. `
`As he spoke, Battler noticed too. `
`They saw that Maria was now holding a beautiful, Western-style envelope. `
`On the front of the envelope, the Ushiromiya family crest—the One-Winged Eagle—was done in gold leaf. `
`Furthermore, the fact that it was sealed with dark-red wax made it clear that this wasn't something Maria could have brought as a prank. `
`"......Maria-chan, what is that?" `
`It seemed that Natsuhi had also noticed the strangeness of the envelope Maria was holding. `
`Her voice sounded too serious for someone admonishing a small child, so the relatives around us finally noticed too. `
`"What happened, Natsuhi nee-san?" `
`".........What... `
`is that?" `
`"Maria, `
`...where did you pick that up...?" `
`"That envelope has... `
`Kinzo-san's......" `
`When Nanjo muttered that, even us kids could understand why everyone seemed to be frozen solid. `
`The envelope that Maria held was one of the Ushiromiya Family Head's custom-made envelopes for private use. `
`......In other words, it could only mean one thing. `
`This envelope contained a message from Kinzo. `
`"Hoh...... `
`...What is an envelope like that doing here...?" `
`"......N-Now that's an interesting thing to come jumping out at us." `
`"......J-Just let me have a peek...!" `
`"Uu-!! `
`No way, I'll read it! `
`I was told to read it to everyone!!" `
`Uncle Hideyoshi tried to snatch the envelope out from Maria's hands, but she protected it as though hugging it and didn't let go. `
`"Hideyoshi-san, you can't use force against a child. `
`.........Maria-chan, where did you get this envelope?" `
`"Uu-! `
`I got it from {f:5:Beatrice} when she gave me the umbrella. `
`She told me to read it to everyone after the meal was over! `
`'I'm the witch's <mes- `
`Me- `
`Messenger>! `
`Uu!" `
`"<Messenger>...? `
`Ihihihi, the almighty witch of the island sure likes to mess around." `
`Battler tried to joke about it, but no one laughed. `
`"...............I-I wonder what's written inside of it. Maria-chan...?" `
`"Uu-. `
`Gonna read it! `
`Uu-!" `
`Maria casually opened the envelope. `
`...It was sealed only with wax, so she just had to remove the sealing wax to open it. `
`...That sealing wax fell onto the desk. `
`Hideyoshi hastily picked it up and stared fixedly at it. `
`He then set it in the center of the table, where Natsuhi, Kyrie, and Nanjo stared at it. `
`Imprinted in the sealing wax...was the One-Winged Eagle, which was the Ushiromiya family crest and also Kinzo's personal crest. `
`"......This...is the Family Head's personal crest..." `
`"......I know it from the letters I have received from Kinzo-san before. `
`Without a doubt, this is his wax seal." `
`"But aren't there several things in this mansion bearing that crest? `
`For example, if there was some kind of stamp for wax seals, couldn't someone other than Kinzo-san have used it?" `
`"No, Kinzo-san would always use a ring on his finger, his Proof of the Ushiromiya Family Headship, when he sealed the wax. `
`This shape and complex design is definitely Kinzo-san's seal..." `
`"That is not necessarily so. `
`Anyone in the family must have received a letter from Father at least once. `
`We can't eliminate the possibility that someone used that wax as a model to create a fake seal and pass themselves off as Father." `
`"I agree with Aniki. `
`No matter how much the seal resembles Dad's, we can't prove that it's the real thing. `
`So it doesn't prove this envelope came from him." `
`"I absolutely agree. `
`I cannot approve of arbitrarily deciding that this letter came from Father...based solely on the wax seal. `
`Doctor Nanjo, couldn't you use a bit more discretion with your vague words...?!" `
`"............I apologize... `
`It was not my place to speak..." `
`One after another, all of the siblings from Krauss on downwards rejected Nanjo's statement, saying that the envelope Maria held wasn't necessarily from Kinzo. `
`They were afraid. `
`They feared from the bottom of their hearts... `
`that Kinzo's intentions were written in there...and that it might be some announcement regarding the inheritance that would be decidedly unfavorable to them. `
`"...Maria, `
`...the person who gave you that envelope was the same person who lent you that umbrella, right...?" `
`"Uu-!" `
`"I don't know what "uu-" means! `
`Is it true?!" `
`"Uu-... `
`......Yes. `
`Uu-." `
`"So, in other words, `
`...the witch, `
`{f:5:Beatrice}, gave Maria-chan that envelope along with the umbrella...?" `
`"Uu-!" `
`Maria nodded forcefully. `
`"...I-I agree with my husband. `
`It's a dubious letter handed over by some suspicious person. `
`It isn't even worth reading." `
`"There's nothing wrong with just reading it, right?" `
`Battler said it to Jessica in a small voice, trying to act tough, but Natsuhi heard him clearly and glared at him with threatening eyes. `
`"A-And then, `
`err, `
`...{f:5:Beatrice} told you to read it after the meal was over, right, Maria?" `
`"Uu-!" `
`".........It's okay, everyone. `
`This envelope didn't come from Grandfather, but from {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`Regardless of who actually wrote it, why can't we just hear what's inside before we decide?" `
`"Th-That's right. `
`Even if Father didn't necessarily write it, I'd still like to know what's written inside. `
`......Maria-chan, I'm sorry I tried to take it from you by force earlier! `
`I apologize, so will you read it aloud in front of everyone?" `
`"............Maria, `
`read it." `
`"Uu-." `
`As all the relatives stared fiercely at Maria, she spread the letter open with a rustle... `
`"......Do you think it really did come from Dad?" `
`"Impossible. `
`Whenever Father has announced something to us in the past, he would always send Genji if he didn't do it directly, correct? `
`...I cannot believe that he would use such a joke-like approach." `
`"That's right. `
`Maria, a <Messenger>? `
`That definitely doesn't suit Father's tastes... `
`Rosa, could this be Maria-chan trying to surprise us by putting on some kind of show...?" `
`".........M-Maria isn't really a kid who'd be capable of something so thoughtful." `
`"Gonna read it. `
`Uu-." `
`The words came out of Maria's mouth, but for some reason, her voice seemed different than usual. `
`Everyone went suddenly silent... `
`"Welcome to Rokkenjima, members of the Ushiromiya family. `
`I am {f:5:Beatrice}, the alchemist for this family employed by Kinzo-sama himself." `
`".........Hah, that's crazy...!" `
`"Quiet!" `
`"I have served him for many years in accordance with our contract, but on this day, Kinzo-sama has announced the final suspension of that contract. `
`Therefore, I ask that you acknowledge my resignation from the position of family alchemist from this day forth." `
`"......How foolish... What nonsense...!" `
`"I-I can't stand to listen to it...!" `
`"And now, there is one part of the contract that must be explained to all present. `
`I, {f:5:Beatrice}, lent Kinzo-sama a vast quantity of gold under certain terms. `
`One of these terms specifies that all the gold is to be returned to me upon the termination of the contract. `
`Furthermore, I am to receive everything of the Ushiromiya family as interest." `
`"R-Ridiculous!!" `
`"...I-It's been ridiculous from the very beginning..." `
`"So it's basically one of those things, right? `
`Doesn't it sound just like one of those contracts with the devil? `
`The contract has expired, so they've come to collect the interest. `
`Is she trying to grab some retirement money for her old age or something? `
`What a cheeky witch." `
`"Battler-kun, now isn't the time to joke around..." `
`Battler made a face as if to ask, "If I can't make fun of this, what can I make fun of?" `
`Some of the adults' faces were pale, while others looked dazed. `
`"After hearing this, you may feel as though Kinzo-sama has been savagely ruthless. `
`However, Kinzo-sama did append a special clause to the contract so that you would have a chance to preserve your wealth and honor. `
`If and only if that special clause is fulfilled, I will lose my rights to the gold and the interest for all eternity." `
`"......A special clause...?" `
`"Wh-What is it...?!" `
`{e:070:Special clause. `
`{f:5:Beatrice} retains the right to collect the gold and accumulated interest upon the termination of the contract. `
`However, if someone is able to discover the hidden gold of this contract, `
`{f:5:Beatrice} must abandon these rights for all time.} `
`{e:070:......The collection of the interest will proceed shortly, but if any one of you fulfills the terms of this special clause, `
`I shall return everything, including the portion that has already been collected. `
`Furthermore, as the first step in this collection of Kinzo-sama's debt, I have taken possession of the Ushiromiya family "Head's Ring", which signifies the passage of the Ushiromiya Family Headship from one individual to another. `
`I ask that you confirm this for yourselves by examining the imprint on the wax seal.} `
`".........Are they trying to claim that {i:that's} the meaning behind this seal...?! `
`That Father would relinquish his ring is unthinkable...!" `
`Krauss stared at the sealing wax as if trying to burn a hole through it. `
`Eva and Rudolf were doing the same over his shoulder! `
`"C-Come to think of it, when we were playing chess, I did have a strange feeling that something was missing from Kinzo-san's finger........." `
`"Doctor Nanjo! `
`Don't say something so careless just because of a vague memory!" `
`"We can't prove its authenticity here. `
`Only by asking Father directly...can we determine whether he really handed over his ring and whether this letter tells the truth." `
`"Th-That's right. `
`It's just as Kyrie-san says..." `
`".........Do you really think... `
`...Kinzo-san will tell you...? `
`After all, that person's thoughts sometimes surpass the bounds of common sense..." `
`"No matter what happens, it's still nonsense...! `
`In the first place, the illusion of gold itself is one of Father's tricks. `
`I've already heard enough talk of that gold from the rest of you!" `
`"But this is the witch speaking, right? `
`About how the inheritance and all of the assets will be handed over to the one who finds the gold, right? `
`So, maybe {f:5:Beatrice}-sama is Father's legal advisor or in charge of his funds..." `
`"W-We can't possibly trust some strange person who entrusts such a suspicious paper to a child!" `
`"Aniki, ...we need you to be frank with us. `
`Is it possible Dad's assets are being managed by someone you don't know?!" `
`"N-No, that's impossible! `
`As the Family Head's representative, I control all of Father's assets! `
`It should be impossible for anyone to do as they please with them without me knowing it!" `
`"So, this must mean there are some assets you don't control, right, Krauss nii-san?" `
`"How foolish! Such assets could not possibly exist!" `
`"...............Oh, but there is such a thing. `
`An asset of Father's that you don't control." `
`"There is no way such a thing could exist!!" `
`"No, it does. `
`............It's Father's...no, {f:5:Beatrice}'s hidden gold!!" `
`"Let's keep it simple. `
`In short, Dad had some trusted confidante that Aniki doesn't even know about. `
`Furthermore, this person has always been in charge of watching and managing the gold. `
`Or, it could be some eccentric, rich person who offered him a loan with rules like a devil's contract." `
`"......Could it be that this confidante called {f:5:Beatrice}...is trying to test which of Kinzo's children is most worthy to be financed by her gold?" `
`Kyrie's question was one that all the siblings wanted answered. `
`Upon reflection, they realized that Kinzo's strange epitaph had hung in the hall beneath the witch's portrait for quite some time, `
`and while it had long been whispered that whoever solved the puzzle would receive everything, ......no one had ever clearly stated it. `
`It was just something that everyone had hoped might be true. `
`And right here, right now, the thing they'd hoped for had been clearly stated in {f:5:Beatrice}'s letter! `
`It clearly specified that everything of the Ushiromiya family would be given to the one who found the gold. `
`"Kinzo-sama has already publicly displayed the location of the hidden gold within the epitaph under my portrait. `
`The rules apply equally to all who can read the epitaph. `
`If you discover the gold, I shall return everything to you. `
`Tonight, I ask that you enjoy your battle of wits with Kinzo-sama to the fullest. `
`I sincerely pray that this night will be both intellectual and elegant. `
`—{f:5:Beatrice} the Golden." `
`"......Father, I know you can hear me! `
`Please respond!" `
`The door to Kinzo's study was being violently, harshly beaten against over and over again like a percussion instrument. `
`The yells coming from the other side belonged to Krauss, Rudolf, and sometimes Eva. `
`It was the siblings, who were trying to intrude upon Kinzo's study to question him about the truth behind that mysterious letter. `
`Kinzo was eating. `
`An elegant tablecloth was set over the desk, and the fabulous dinner that had adorned the table down in the dining hall was reproduced here. `
`Kinzo continued his meal in silence. `
`...Shannon, taking away an empty plate, looked uncomfortably between the door being pounded on and Kinzo's face. `
`"............Everyone is calling for you, `
`...but what should I do...?" `
`"...Leave them. `
`God and my meals both hold silence as a virtue." `
`"Should I silence them?" `
`"There's no need. `
`It does not even reach my ears." `
`Kinzo enjoyed his food, apparently indifferent. `
`Genji quietly lowered his head and took a single step back. `
`...As he did, Kanon, who stood in reserve like a shadow behind and to the side of Genji, opened his mouth. `
`".........Maria-sama apparently received a letter from {f:5:Beatrice}-sama, so I imagine they want to test its authenticity." `
`"...Hahahaha... `
`.........Has she started already then? `
`............Come, {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`I have no shortage of coins to be wagered. `
`Shall we enjoy this night to the fullest? `
`......I don't think I'll lose. `
`Your smile will be mine for all eternity. `
`If I could see it one more time, I wouldn't regret losing my wealth, my honor, or even my life." `
`"......Well then, the roulette has begun to spin. `
`Which pocket will the ball fall into? `
`Noir? Rouge? `
`Or house takes all? `
`Come, you may begin, {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`I'll show you the power of miracles once more...!" `
