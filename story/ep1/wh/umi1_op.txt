`"............Again. `
`...So, you still haven't overcome your love of alcohol?" `
`The old physician let out a sigh as he removed the stethoscope. `
`Two elderly men could be seen in the dimly-lit study, which was filled with dust and a sickly-sweet stench. `
`In the corner of this room, which was much larger than what most people would call a study, `
`was an expensive-looking bed, a man undergoing a medical examination, and the physician conducting it. `
`There was also what appeared to be a servant watching over the whole scene. `
`"The bottle is my friend. `
`It is no less of a friend than you, and it has stood by my side even longer than you have." `
`As the man baring his chest for the stethoscope rearranged his clothes, he spoke unapologetically. `
`"............Kinzo‐{c:86EF9C:san}. `
`...your body only appears to be well thanks to the effects of the medicine. `
`However, if you continue to drink such strong spirits, the treatment will become meaningless. `
`...Trust my judgement. `
`Refrain from drinking." `
`"I thank you, though only for the sentiment `
`, my friend. `
`.........Genji, `
`another glass. `
`Water it down slightly. `
`That way Nanjo can save face." `
`".........Are you quite sure?" `
`After eyeing both the master who demanded the alcohol and the family doctor who forbade it, `
`Genji, the old butler, silently gave a slight nod and carried out his master's orders faithfully. `
`The family doctor, Nanjo, let out a deep sigh once again as he watched the butler busy himself alongside the liquor cabinet... `
`There was a smell filling up the room. `
`...This sweet, poisonous aroma felt as though it melted the heart, if not the soul itself. `
`It was the smell of that venomous green drink that the man couldn't bear to part with. `
`"......Nanjo, `
`you are my close friend, and we have known each other for quite a long time. `
`I am deeply grateful for all that you have done to keep me alive this long." `
`"I have done nothing. `
`......After all, you never listen to my advice as your physician." `
`"Hahahaha... `
`And you never listen when I warn you about a mistaken chess move you're about to make. `
`It seems only fair, does it not?" `
`"......Master." `
`"Thank you. `
`......I wouldn't die if I ran out of your medicine, but I would if I ran out of this." `
`Disregarding Nanjo, who had his face set in a resigned expression, Kinzo took the glass that Genji was holding out to him. `
`...Very few people would associate that venomous color with an alcoholic beverage. `
`".........Nanjo, `
`be honest with me. `
`How much time do I have left?" `
`"Well now... `
`How short must I make it to convince you to set the bottle aside?" `
`Nanjo once again let out a sigh of resignation. `
`Then, he finally spoke to Kinzo as the latter swirled his glass. `
`"......You don't have long." `
`"...What precisely do you mean by that?" `
`"......Let us illustrate it with the chess game here. `
`You have very nearly achieved checkmate, ...but you have not yet cornered my king." `
`Nanjo's gaze was directed at a side table with a massive chess set placed on top of it. `
`Judging by the positioning of the pieces, the game seemed to be entering its final stage. `
`Black's rook and bishop were cutting deeply into enemy lines. `
`White's king had already been castled and cornered, so that even an amateur could see that the match would reach its conclusion before too long. `
`Every time Nanjo came to give a medical examination, both of them would make a few moves. `
`Nanjo was hinting that Kinzo would most likely fall into his eternal sleep before this game could be concluded. `
`...These were less the words of a physician than they were the words of an old friend. `
`"............Were you a normal patient, `
`I would recommend that you write a will at this point." `
`"......And what is a will, Nanjo? `
`Handwritten instructions to the vultures on how to devour and scatter my corpse?" `
`"No, not at all. `
`......As the word suggests, it is a way for you to record your will for later generations. `
`It is far more than just a means to divide up your inheritance." `
`"Hoh. `
`......And apart from the division of the inheritance, what might I write of?" `
`"............You might write of your regrets... `
`or matters you have left unfinished. `
`Things you want to pass down to others... `
`...or merely matters you wish to communicate. `
`......Anything you want." `
`"...Hmph. `
`.........Things I want to pass down to others or matters I wish to communicate? `
`Ridiculous. `
`I, Ushiromiya Kinzo, have not one thing I want to tell or leave behind!! `
`I was born with nothing. `
`I will die with nothing! `
`There is nothing I wish to leave to my foolish children!! `
`Even if the end were to come today, even if it were to come right now! `
`I would accept that fate of death without a trace of fear!! `
`"......Kinzo‐san." `
`I created everything. `
`My fortune! `
`My prestige! `
`Everything!! `
`Those were built up by me, and they will be lost along with me. `
`There is nothing I wish to leave behind!!" `
`"Nothing!! `
`"After I'm gone, I care not if it all goes to waste! `
`I desire no tomb, no coffin!! `
`Those were the terms of the contract I made with the witch! `
`When I die, everything will be lost! `
`That has been part of the promise since the beginning, and that's why nothing will be left behind. `
`There is nothing I can leave behind!!" `
`After reaching a furious crescendo, Kinzo suddenly slumped over. `
`...His expression was limp and feeble, as though an evil spirit had possessed him and then left. `
`............ `
`"However, I do have one regret. `
`I have nothing to leave behind, but there is one thing I cannot leave undone..." `
`".........You would do well to write it down. `
`Of course, it would be best if you could finish it before your time comes. `
`However, even if the worst happens, those who come after you will carry it to completion. `
`You must leave behind your regrets so that they can be resolved even if you are unable to do so yourself. `
`......That is the purpose of a will." `
`When Nanjo tried to gently pat Kinzo's shoulder, the dying man flew into a sudden rage and batted away Nanjo's hand. `
`"It's useless, useless, useless!! `
`It must be done while I still live! At the moment of my death, my soul will be devoured by the demons of the contract and wiped out of existence! `
`For me, there will be no peace or another world after death! `
`That's why everything must be completed before I go!! `
`That's why a will has no meaning for me!! `
`And even if I had a chance to write such a thing, `
`......if I did have such a chance!!" `
`"...I'd want to see it. `
`I want to see it one more time! `
`I want to see Beatrice's smiling face one last time!! `
`Oh, Beatrice, why have you resisted me for so long?! `
`I'll return everything you have given me! I am prepared to lose everything!! `
`So please, show me your smile just one more time..." `
`"Beatrice, I beg of you! You must be able to hear my plea, ...that's the kind of woman you are! `
`I beg of you, show yourself to me!! `
`You're here, aren't you?! `
`You're standing there, invisible, listening to every word I say, and even now you're mocking me from somewhere in this room, aren't you?! `
`Please, appear before me once more and smile!! `
`Feel free to scold me, even snatch away my life by your own hands if you so desire!! `
`I don't want to die alone like this!! `
`I cannot let myself die until I've seen your smile just one more time!! `
`Aah, Beatrice, Beatrice!! `
`I offer up this life of mine, I offer it up to you!! `
`I'm begging you, Beatriiiiiiiiiiiice!!!" `
`"Whoa... `
`Things sure move with the times... `
`I can't believe we'll be able to make the trip in just twenty minutes..." `
`I couldn't help but scratch my head and marvel at how far things have come in recent years. `
`We used to go by boat. `
`Back then, we were all forced to endure nearly half a day of swaying back and forth over the sea before we reached Niijima. `
`Things have gotten so much more convenient these days. `
`Still, I've never been on a plane this small. `
`I've flown in a huge jumbo jet before, but this'll be my first experience in such a tiny one. `
`...It's gonna shake, isn't it... `
`They say smaller boats shake more than big ones, so I guess the same rule probably applies to planes. `
`...Aaah, just spare me. `
`"Haahahaha, don't worry, Battler-kun. `
`It shakes much less than that boat did." `
`"Gyah?! ...I-Is that you, George-{c:86EF9C:aniki}?! `
`Heheh, don't scare me like that... You just shaved three years off my life. `
`Anyway, what's shaking got to do with anything? `
`Ihihihi, you don't think I'm actually scared of the plane shaking or maybe falling out of the sky or something, right?" `
`"Oh, of course not, my mistake. `
`I see you've changed a lot since we last saw you. `
`After all, it's been six years since then. `
`You're not a kid anymore. `
`Hahahahaha." `
`"Sheesh, and here you are, old enough to smoke and drink. `
`I've got no interest in smoking, but I've always wanted to try some booze, heheheh! `
`Well, if you've got your dad's genes, I'll bet you can hold your own when it comes to drinking, right?" `
`"Well, I usually drink for business rather than pleasure. `
`It's pretty hard to do business in Japan without it." `
`"Ihihihi! `
`That's exactly right! `
`That's why I never miss a chance to get in some practice!" `
`"Th-That's no good, Battler-kun! You're still a minor! `
`Don't you know alcohol can stunt the growth of... `
`...um, never mind." `
`"Come on, I'm tall enough already! `
`In fact, it'd be easier to find clothes if I shrunk a little!" `
`I puffed my chest out proudly. `
`Until I hit my growth spurt, my height was below average in my class. `
`But then, I grew and grew, and before I knew it, I'd passed 180cm (5ft 11in). `
`I guess I have all that muscle training and those shady mail-order performance-enhancing drugs to thank for that. `
`Before then, I never dreamed that I'd shoot 10 cm above George-aniki, who'd reached his peak height early on. `
`......Damn, I'll bet my relatives all say "Look how big you've grown, Battler-chan!" or something. `
`...It's all so embarrassing...I wish they'd just give me a break. `
`Anyway, my name, "Battler"... `
`...well, it's pretty damn weird, don't you think? `
`I've gotta wonder what my parents were thinking when they named me that. `
`I've never met anyone who could read it right the first time. `
`I usually get called "{c:86EF9C:Sento‐kun}". `
`Sorry, but that's not even close. `
`My name is written {p:0:右代宮 戦人}. `
`Can you read it? `
`The first part is my family name, "Ushiromiya". `
`That's a fairly plausible Japanese pronunciation so far. `
`The problem is my given name. `
`.........{p:0:戦人} is made up of the characters for "fight" and "person", and it's pronounced "Battler". `
`Put it all together, and you've got Ushiromiya Battler. `
`Pretty crazy, right? `
`It's crazy enough that my parents decided to call me that, but it's even more crazy that some government worker let them make it official. `
`...Both groups are at the top of my must-kill list. `
`Anyway, this is one of my cousins. `
`His name is {p:0:右代宮 譲治}, pronounced Ushiromiya George. `
`He's five years older than me, so he must be turning 23 this year. `
`Since the Ushiromiya cousins consist of two boys and two girls, I ended up playing with George all the time. `
`And because I've always thought of him as a big brother, I still call him "Aniki" today. `
`"Whoo, Battler-kun, look how big you've gotten. `
`You know what they say, leave a boy for three days and you'll hardly recognize 'im!" `
`"It must be in his blood. `
`Rudolf wasn't that tall either until his high school years. `
`Perhaps people end up taller if their growth spurt comes late." `
`"Nah, it's nothing special. `
`A real man needs to be tough on the inside too!" `
`"Exactly! `
`Battler-kun here knows how it works! `
`Real men win or lose based on what they've got on the inside! `
`Can't ever forget to keep up your trainin' and discipline. `
`You gotta do that, wait veeery alertly for the perfect moment...and strike! `
`Now, I never even imagined that I'd become the company president I am today, master of my own domain... `
`Yep, to think I've come this far after starting out penniless and ruined...!" `
`This stout, plump, old guy is `
`George-aniki's dad, Uncle Hideyoshi ({p:0:秀吉}). `
`He's the husband of Dad's older sister. `
`In other words, we're not blood-related. `
`He's nice to children, sociable all the time, and even quick to give out some spending money to us kids. Simply put, he's an awesome uncle. `
`He speaks in an odd and very noticeable Kansai dialect, but he's actually a natural-born Kanto man. `
`Apparently, impressions are everything in the business world, `
`so speaking in a different style than other people is an act that makes him stick out more. `
`......However, I hear he gets embarrassed when talking within earshot of a real Kansai person, so he switches back to standard Japanese. `
`...I don't really get it, but he's definitely an interesting person. `
`"If only you weren't so quick to brag about your life story. `
`That's enough for now, I think. `
`I'm sure Battler's getting tired of it. `
`Aren't you?" `
`"Nope, not at all, hihihi! `
`Nothing wrong with that. `
`I think it's pretty cool for a man to have some stories he can brag about. `
`I don't have anything like that at all." `
`"Oh, really? `
`I'd imagine a man with your looks would leave girls crying left and right. I can't believe you have nothing at all to brag about. `
`"Nonononono! `
`Y-Y- `
`You're joking, right?! `
`Of course nothing weird like that's ever happened to me! `
`In fact, if you know anyone, I'm all ears!" `
`"Come on, you aren't fooling anyone. `
`...*giggle* You must tell your aunt all about it later. `
`After all, nothing of the sort ever happens to George. `
`Heheheh..." `
`This is George-aniki's mother, Aunt Eva ({p:0:絵羽}). `
`She's my Dad's older sister. `
`She and Uncle Hideyoshi are a pair of jokers, and they've always teased me, back as far as I can remember. `
`This sometimes made them a bit hard to get along with when I was small. `
`...Well, I guess the events of the last 30 seconds prove that they can still be hard to get along with. `
`Even so, George-aniki's family is interesting and fun, and they seem to get along just fine. `
`......Sheesh, that's pretty much the total opposite of my family. `
`"Battler-kun, `
`have you seen Rudolf-san?" `
`"Huh? `
`He headed off to the bathroom a while ago. `
`Is he not back yet? `
`Heh, maybe the poor geezer dropped dead, {c:86EF9C:namunamunamu}." `
`"That's no way to talk about your own father. `
`Still, this isn't the first time he's taken so long in the bathroom." `
`"Yeah, the guy's always been that way. `
`Does he really have to take a magazine with him every time he needs to take a dump? `
`And what on Earth's he doing in there with those particular magazines?! `
`Ihihi!" `
`"Oh, you don't need to worry about that at all. `
`Since we've been together, I haven't let him do that on his own." `
`"Hihihi! `
`Oooh, I'll have to get the juicy details later! `
`Sounds like Dad's got his balls in an iron grip." `
`"You know exactly what would happen with that man if I didn't keep a tight grip, don't you?" `
`"No kidding. `
`You're the only one capable of reigning in that old bastard. `
`As his son, I'm more than happy to let you take over." `
`"Yes, leave it all to me. `
`After all, that's my specialty." `
`This woman is my father's wife. `
`Her name is Ushiromiya Kyrie ({p:0:霧江}). `
`As you can probably tell from our conversation, she's not my real mother. `
`She's basically my stepmother. `
`My real mom died six years ago.
`Kyrie-san is the woman Dad married afterwards. `
`It's understandable for someone my age. `
`I could never bring myself to call his new wife "Mom". `
`And I doubt she feels like using the word "son" on this massive kid who's no relation to her at all. `
`We aren't little kids. `
`We know there's nothing to be gained by fighting. `
`So, we decided that we wouldn't force ourselves to pretend that we were family. `
`I've decided to act a bit more frank with her, acting as though she's a friendly neighbor instead. `
`It's much easier if we just keep a little distance, instead of forcing ourselves to act all close and making each other uncomfortable. `
`Kyrie-san has always been very open about all this, and thanks to that, we've been able to get along pretty well. `
`Then, just when we were badmouthing Dad about being in the bathroom, `
`the man himself came back, wiping his hands with a handkerchief. `
`"Hmm? `
`Battler." `
`"Hey, what's up, Dad? `
`...Owowowowww! `
`Don't pinch my ear, gaah!" `
`"So, you've been talking trash about me with Mom again, haven't you? `
`What makes it so hard to show a little respect for your father, hmm?" `
`"Owowow, owowowowow! `
`Dammit, that hurts! `
`You can stretch my ear all you want, but I'm not gonna be able to fly. That hurts!!" `
`"C'mon now. `
`Up, `
`up, `
`down, `
`down, `
`left, `
`right, `
`left, `
`right. `
`Now say "Father, please forgive me for being so rude"." `
`"Like hell I will! Go find yourself some members-only store if you want it that much! `
`Gyaah, let goooo!!" `
`......This old bastard is my Dad. `
`I think I'm pretty tall myself, but Dad's just about as tall as I am. `
`It's no surprise Aunt Eva started talking about Dad's blood when she saw my height. `
`By the way, my height isn't the only thing I got from him. `
`It seems having weird names runs in the family. `
`Dad's full name is written {p:0:右代宮 留弗夫}. `
`......You can't read it, can you? `
`Come on, it's just {p:0:留弗夫}. `
`Anyway, this guy's name is pronounced "Rudolf". `
`Haha... He must hate Grandfather for giving him that name. `
`Still, that's no reason to pass that weird naming tradition onto me. `
`As the old bastard twisted my ear all over the place, Aunt Eva snuck up behind him and grabbed his ear. `
`"Hey, Rudolf. `
`You should know better than to physically abuse your son." `
`"Gyaah, that hurts, Aneki..." `
`This scene perfectly illustrated the relationship between the prankster younger brother...and the older sister who could deal out punishment to him despite his size. `
`"I think that's good enough for now, Eva nee-san. `
`I'll make sure to stretch out his other ear later on." `
`"Oh, my apologies. `
`I must leave some pulling for you to do, Kyrie-san. `
`Rudolf? `
`Make sure Kyrie-san gives you lots and lots of punishment later on, okay?" `
`"You're one to talk, Aneki, abusing your little brother like that. `
`Hideyoshi nii-san, I'd like to thank you very much for picking her up. `
`If you hadn't been so generous, she'd still be unsold in the store. `
`You have my gratitude and apologies." `
`"...What?! `
`Who are you calling "unsold"?" `
`After taking 2...3 steps back, `
`Aunt Eva unleashed one of her beautiful high reverse roundhouse kicks, which stopped just a centimeter away from the tip of Dad's nose. `
`After starting out with Tai-chi-chuan for her figure, Aunt Eva then developed an interest in the Chinese martial arts. `
`After that, she went through karate, tae kwon do, capoeira, ...and what is it she's learning now, again? `
`...Well anyway, they say a woman's weapons are in her lower body, and that's literally true for Eva. `
`"Rudooolf? `
`Did you know that a single direct blow to the side of the head like that would knock you unconscious? `
`Not so long ago, I accidently connected in a practice match and my opponent was out cold." `
`"...Sheesh, what a pain. `
`I'm so sorry she can't help walking like a freak." `
`Dad, completely unfazed, shrugged and smiled ironically at Uncle Hideyoshi. `
`"Wahahaha, never had a brother or sister myself. `
`So, when I see you two bickerin' with each other, it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. `
`It sure is nice to have a big family." `
`"Oh, then why not consider making a little brother for George-kun? `
`He's already a fine adult who's about to go off on his own, so it might be a good time to have another child." `
`"Hey, have a little sympathy for the new kid, and all the pain and suffering he'd have to live through. `
`I'm surprised even George-kun turned out as well as he did after being born from this sinister sister of mine. `
`And what an awesome kid he is. `
`Please share some of that with our blockhead of a son someday, will you?" `
`"That's not at all how it happened. `
`It's thanks to Eva nee-san's proper rearing that George-kun became the kind, gentle kid he is now. `
`Isn't that right, Nee-san?" `
`"Oh, come now. Heheh, you think so...? `
`Our George still has a long way to go. `
`Ah, by the way, how's your little Ange-chan doing? `
`I heard she was vomiting?" `
`"Oh, that's right! `
`And I was hopin' to finally see her face after such a long time. `
`Is she okay?" `
`"She often catches a cold when the seasons change. `
`She's very frail... `
`I did want to bring her along, but we decided to have my family look after her this time." `
`"I think that's a wise move. `
`She'll heal a lot better if she stays away from that venomous Head Family household. `
`A child's health is always more important than an adult's convenience, don't you think?" `
`"I know of some great medicine for vomitin' colds like that! `
`When we get back home, I'll send some to you right away, so please let her try some!" `
`"Thank you very much, Hideyoshi nii-san. `
`I'm always in your debt..." `
`...And once the conversation suddenly veered off in that direction, we kids didn't have any chance of butting in. `
`For now, I'm just happy Aunt Eva gave Dad his just deserts for tugging on my ear. `
`"Are we still waiting for the weather report?" `
`George-aniki pointed at the counter. `
`The "checking weather" sign was still stuck next to the departure times for the flight we were scheduled to board. `
`According to Aniki, smaller planes are more subject to winds and other effects of the weather, `
`and it's not at all uncommon for flights to be delayed because of that. `
`...Wait a sec, we {i:are} totally sure it's not gonna shake, ...right...? `
`From down here on the ground, it just looks cloudy, not windy. `
`...Well, I guess it's different up where the planes fly. `
`"The weather's a bit uncertain today." `
`Aunt Eva looked at a TV in the lounge. `
`The weather forecast was being broadcasted, informing us that a typhoon was approaching the Kanto region. `
`"A typhoon again? `
`......Guess there's no helping it, with the annual family conference being held in October. `
`Couldn't he have chosen a better season?" `
`"I agree. `
`I've always hoped we could have it sometime around the Obon festival in mid-August. `
`In that case, why don't you suggest that to Father and Nii-san during the conference?" `
`"...Very funny. `
`Why don't you do it yourself? `
`Our brother would never listen to anything I suggested." `
`"No way. `
`It doesn't really bother me that much to have it in October. `
`I was just saying you might want to propose it, `
`since you said you hate typhoons so much." `
`"I only said that typhoons always come around this time of year. `
`You're the one who said you wanted to move it to the Obon festival, right?" `
`"Well, you said it too last year! `
`Didn't you say that it would be easier to fit into your schedule if we had it during the Obon festival?!" `
`"I never said anything like that." `
`"Oh yes, you did. `
`I certainly wouldn't forget something like that!" `
`"No, I didn't... You're the one saying that all the time!" `
`"Didn't you know? `
`Stopping a kick just a hair's breadth away from impact is a very high-level technique." `
`"Sheesh, women your age shouldn't spread their legs like that!" `
`Dad and Aunt Eva's argument looked no different from a couple of brats quarreling... `
`"Even though they usually behave like normal parents, `
`they turn right back into kids again when they meet their siblings at these family conferences." `
`"You're the one who looks like an real adult, analyzing it all calmly. `
`......I hope I never turn out like that old bastard. `
`I'd much rather end up as an intellectual adult like you, Aniki." `
`"Like me? `
`Oh, I still have a long way to go. `
`I still have very little experience out there in the real world, and I need to work on becoming more confident and sociable. `
`...I think you've far surpassed me on all of those counts, Battler-kun. `
`I'm sure you'll outstrip me fast enough when you become an adult." `
`George-aniki scratched his head and laughed, as though trying to hide his embarrassment. `
`Of course, he was just being humble. `
`Aniki entered a university and became an apprentice at Uncle Hideyoshi's company at the same time, studying both academics and how to become a business emperor in parallel. `
`Then, right after graduating, he got into Uncle Hideyoshi's company as his father's aide, piling up a lot of real-life experience as he devoted himself zealously to his work. `
`His great dream is to one day stand on his own and build up his own kingdom. `
`Aniki is a real paragon of a man, sparing no effort as he strives towards his goal. `
`It's no exaggeration to say that I really respect him. `
`And then there's me. `
`I'm nothing at all like Aniki. `
`I'm living my happy-go-lucky, idle high school life to the max. `
`I've got no dreams for the future! `
`I'd like to just sit back, stay cool, and let the money flow in, but of course that could never happen. `
`...When Aniki was my age, he had already formed an impressive objective and had started devoting himself towards studying for that goal, so I guess I can't compare at all. `
`My dad just says "Sure you can study at my company, if you like cleaning toilets". `
`Dammit, I'm not gonna be in the debt of that old bastard. `
`I'll find my way myself! `
`.........If only willpower was all it took to become an adult. `
`Should I go on one of those self-searching journeys that are all the rage these days? `
`......Well, it's not like I could mooch off my parents for that kind of money... `
`"......hm?! Ohh~!" `
`Right then, Uncle Hideyoshi shouted out loudly. `
`He's a really nice person on the whole, but he does have a problem controlling the volume of his voice. `
`When I looked over, I saw that he was greeting Aunt Rosa, who had come late. `
`"Ohoooooooooh!!! `
`If it isn't Rosa-san! `
`Maria-chan, long time no see!!" `
`"Long time no see! `
`Uu-!" `
`"Maria! `
`Shouldn't that be "It's good to see you again"? `
`Greet your uncle properly." `
`"Uu-. `
`It's...good to see you again..." `
`"There ya go! `
`Well said! `
`How about some candy as a reward?! `
`......Oh, huh? `
`Where'd I put it..." `
`"Rosa-san, it's good to see you again. `
`It's good to see you too, Maria-chan." `
`"It's been too long, Kyrie nee-san, Hideyoshi nii-san. `
`...And, `
`......oh my, Battler-kun?! `
`Look how big you've gotten...!" `
`"Ah, come on, hahaha... `
`It's embarrassing hearing that from every person I meet...!" `
`"Hey, Rosa. `
`You're late. `
`If the plane was on time, you'd barely have made it..." `
`"I'm sorry. `
`We had some trouble making our train connection. `
`So, are we waiting on the weather again?" `
`"Oh, don't complain. `
`I much prefer the 30-minute plane trip to spending six hours bouncing about on a boat. `
`Even if we're kept waiting here for an hour, it's still much faster overall." `
`"Maria-chan's gotten huge too!! `
`So, how tall are you now?" `
`"Uu-! `
`So, how tall am I now?!" `
`Maria-chan parroted Uncle Hideyoshi's question, looking up at her mother. `
`I guess she doesn't remember her own height. `
`She's probably right in the middle of a growth spurt, so her height must change every month. `
`Give it a few more years, and she'll suddenly start looking feminine. `
`"Umm, ...just how tall were you the last time you got measured...? `
`You keep getting bigger and bigger, don't you? `
`Right?" `
`"Uu-!" `
`"I think she's grown a lot since last year. `
`Let's see, she turned nine years old this year, didn't she?" `
`"Nine years old. `
`Uu-." `
`"That's right, you're nine years old now. `
`Glad to see you're doing well too, Maria-chan! `
`Up you go- `
`nnngg... `
`I guess you've gotten a bit too heavy to play airplane with..." `
`"George-aniki, what a rude thing to say to a lady. `
`Here, I'll do it...up ya go-..." `
`"......Uu-." `
`When I went to lift her up in Aniki's place, Maria stiffened defensively, staring suspiciously at my face. `
`...Ah, that's right. `
`The last time I met Maria, it was six years ago, and she was only three years old. `
`Of course she doesn't remember my face. `
`"Maria-chan, don't you remember? `
`It's Battler-kun. `
`You used to play together, remember?" `
`".........Uu-." `
`"No surprise, I guess. `
`The last time she met Battler, she was only three. `
`You don't keep memories at that age." `
`She must know everyone's face apart from mine because she meets them every year, but I haven't had contact with the Ushiromiya family for about six years now. `
`So, it's no surprise that this nine-year-old girl doesn't have any memories of me. `
`Even I can only just barely remember her being a three-year-old crybaby. `
`"Maria, `
`this is Battler onii-chan. `
`Rudolf nii-san's son. `
`...Understand?" `
`"............The brother's son is... `
`The brother is the son... `
`............?? `
`......Uuuu---!!" `
`That "uu-" sound was probably her brain going into overload at that complicated explanation. `
`I guess the phrasing of that was a bit confusing. Nii or Onii, the title you'd use to refer to an actual older brother, can also be a friendly honorific for a boy who's only a bit older than you. It's just like Nee or Onee, the word for big sister. `
`"Maria-chan, `
`this is Battler-kun. `
`He's your cousin, like me." `
`"......Like George onii-chan? `
`...Battler? `
`Cousin? `
`......Uu-." `
`"That's right. `
`You got it." `
`This part of Aniki is what makes me really look up to him. `
`For someone who isn't married, he's just great at dealing with kids. `
`I'm sure he'll be an indulgent father in the future. `
`"...Battler onii-chan?" `
`Maria looked straight at me with a questioning expression, as though asking whether it was okay to call me that. `
`"Yep, that's me, Battler. `
`Nice to meet you, Maria!" `
`"Uu-! `
`Battler!" `
`"Maria! `
`You mustn't talk to him like that! Call him Battler onii-chan...!" `
`"That's all right, Aunt Rosa. `
`I don't sweat the small stuff. `
`Hey, Maria! `
`We're close enough that we don't need honorifics, right?!" `
`"Battler, Battler, Battleeerrr! `
`Uu-uu-!" `
`"That's right, Maria, Maria, Mariaaa! `
`Uu-uu-!!" `
`We horsed around for a while to make up for the six year gap in our friendship. `
`She probably still thinks of me as nothing more than a big new friend, but things'll probably work out as we get to know each other again. `
`But I'm surprised. `
`She's just the way I remembered her being six years ago. `
`Seems that people just don't change that much after all. `
`I'm a bit happy that she's still the pure, innocent girl I remember. `
`Her name is written {p:0:真里亞}. `
`...Of course, `
`{p:0:真里亞} is pronounced "Maria". `
`The third character looks like a cross, which is pretty cool. `
`Her feelings don't usually show up on her face, so it can be difficult to know just what she's thinking, but that's just how she looks on the outside. `
`On the inside, she's just a sweet, normal girl. `
`Then there's Maria's mother, Aunt Rosa. `
`She's my dad's younger sister. `
`Rosa is written {p:0:楼座}. `
`...Here's a name that's totally not Japanese. `
`Sorry to say it, but her name's almost as ridiculous as Dad's... `
`I've got to respect her for not ending up as screwed up as he is. `
`...When I think about it, all the names in my family sound foreign. `
`Just why is Grandfather so obsessed with that? `
`Because of him, even we grandchildren have to put up with this weird naming sense. `
`It's even more annoying since Grandfather's own name is perfectly normal. `
`Anyway, there's one thing about Aunt Rosa that's a relief compared to the other family members. `
`The old bastard and Aunt Eva have this annoying urge to tease and mock people all the time, `
`but even though she shares their blood, Aunt Rosa isn't like that at all. `
`She has the most common sense among all the siblings. `
`Like Uncle Hideyoshi, she's a kind aunt who'll always be on the kids' side. `
`......However, possibly because she's more strict as a parent, she's not liberal with handing out spending money like Uncle Hideyoshi. `
`Okay. `
`Now we have the entire group of family members who are going to board the plane. `
`At that moment, as though it had waited for us all to arrive, an announcement rang out through the lobby. `
`"Our apologies for the delay. `
`Boarding will now commence for Flight 201 to Niijima. `
`We ask that the passengers please form two lines in front of the counter, behind the white line." `
`"Rosa, you still haven't gone through boarding procedures, right? Hurry up." `
`"Oh no...! `
`Maria, come on!" `
`"Uu-!" `
`We had to go through a metal detector before going out on the runway. `
`Our small plane wasn't as massive as an international flight, but it was still a plane. `
`A staff member holding a metal detector checked us all. `
`Once all of us cleared the check, we followed the staff member out onto the runway. `
`Come to think of it, everyone here is in the Ushiromiya family. `
`It's like this is a reserved charter flight or something. `
`Our group stopped in front of the entrance to the airplane. `
`Then, our guide turned around and spoke, looking down at the passenger list as he did. `
`"Boarding will now commence. `
`As I call out the names on the passenger list, `
`please take your seats in order, starting from the front row on the right side and going right to left, then onto the next row. `
`I will now begin reading the passenger list. `
`Ushiromiya Hideyoshi-sama!" `
`"Oh, I'm first! `
`Right here! `
`...By the way, do you have some candy, Eva? `
`I've been lookin' all over for some, but I can't find any." `
`"Ushiromiya Eva-sama." `
`"They're in my handbag. `
`I'll get one once we're inside the plane." `
`I've heard that candies are a good way to protect your ears from hurting because of variations in atmospheric pressure when landing or taking off. `
`That's probably what they're talking about. `
`"...Hope I get a window seat!" `
`"Hahaha, don't worry. `
`There aren't any other kinds of seats." `
`As George-aniki said, there were apparently only two lines of seats. `
`So, this is what a small plane is like... `
`......We {i:are} totally sure it's not gonna shake, right...? `
`"Ushiromiya George-sama." `
`"Right here. `
`Don't worry, Battler-kun. `
`It won't shake too much." `
`"Ushiromiya Battler-sama." `
`"A-Aniki, what do you mean "not too much"?! `
`You can just swim if you fall from a boat, but if a plane crashes you're screwed, right?! `
`We all get our own parachutes in our seats, don't we? `
`Wait, we don't?!" `
`"Ushiromiya Rudolf-sama." `
`"Come on, Battler, stop standing there slack-jawed and get in." `
`"Ow! Dad! `
`Don't push me! `
`We don't get parachutes!" `
`"Ushiromiya Kyrie-sama." `
`"Okay, you two, stop fooling around. `
`Let's move on in." `
`"Ow! Kyrie! `
`Don't push me! `
`This blockhead isn't moving!" `
`"Ushiromiya Maria-sama." `
`"Uu-! `
`Let's move on in!" `
`"Ushiromiya Rosa-sama." `
`"Maria! `
`Be quiet..." `
`"This is your pilot, Kawabata. `
`We'd like to thank you for taking New Tokyo Aviation's Flight 201 today. `
`We estimate that the flight to Niijima airport will take about 20 minutes. `
`We are receiving reports of atmospheric turbulence. `
`There may be some shaking of the aircraft, so we ask that you do not unfasten your seat belts after takeoff." `
`"A-Aniki, did that guy just say we needed to wear seatbelts?! `
`In a jumbo jet, they let you undo them after takeoff, right?! `
`So it's gonna shake so much we can't take them off?! `
`Dammit, you tricked me! It is going to shake after all! `
`Where are the parachutes?! `
`I knew I should've taken the boooooaaaaat!!" `
