`"So...on the tenth twilight, the journey ends, `
`and you reach the Golden Land. `
`You really are diligent, Maria. `
`You did a good job writing this all down." `
`"Uu-! `
`I forget a lot, so I always write things down! `
`Mama told me to!" `
`There was a notebook inside the handbag Maria was always carrying around, `
`and {f:5:Beatrice}'s epitaph was copied onto it. `
`Thanks to that, `
`we were all able to challenge the puzzle of the epitaph while walking down this beach. `
`Jessica and the rest had already tried to solve it several times... `
`and had already gotten bored with it. `
`However, `
`since this was a first for me, `
`I was so excited that I couldn't stop. `
`It really tickled my sense of adventure! `
`"Let's start with the first line. `
`Behold the sweetfish river running through my beloved hometown. `
`Where was Grandfather's hometown again?" `
`"I heard that before the war, the Ushiromiya family had a mansion near Odawara. `
`Which makes you wanna know which sweetfish river flows through Odawara, right?" `
`"Yeah, 'cause that river would be the starting place. `
`Anyone searching for the Golden Land would head down that and search for the key. `
`What's this river in Odawara? `
`Does it have sweetfish swimming in it?" `
`"If you're looking for sweetfish in Odawara, it'd have to be Hayakawa. `
`It's famous for its mountain stream fishing." `
`"Uu-. `
`I hate fiiish." `
`"Ihihi, Maria, you'll understand when you get a bit older! `
`Licklicklick salty roasted sweetfish! `
`Yummy! `
`Even though we just ate, I'm getting hungry again." `
`"...Umm, shall I bring you a biscuit?" `
`"Huh? `
`Oh, sorry. That's not what I meant, don't mind it!" `
`Shannon-chan was faithfully keeping us company, since she didn't have any afternoon chores for a while. `
`I would've thought that, since she's a servant, accompanying us would force her to take care of us and tire her out, but that didn't seem to be the case for her. `
`...On the contrary, she seemed to enjoy joining in on a conversation with people close to her age. `
`When I asked, I heard that she was the sort of worker whose room and board were supplied by her employer. `
`So normally, the only person close to her in age was Jessica. `
`Yeah, I can imagine how that might be pretty dull. `
`"Okay, so I get that the sweetfish-filled river near Odawara is Hayakawa. `
`In that case, we've gotta go down it! `
`Do you find anything if you head down Hayakawa river?" `
`"Ummm, `
`.........if you follow it downstream, you'll arrive at the ocean." `
`"Of course, you'd reach the mouth of the river! `
`And the third line of the epitaph was "As you travel down it, you will see a village." `
`By the way, since long ago, the mouths of rivers have been key points in transportation, and large cities tend to be built there. `
`That'd be the next checkpoint." `
`"Hmmmmmm. `
`That's a pretty good theory. `
`Just like you guessed, there's an old city there that was very prosperous in ancient times. `
`That's where Odawara Castle is." `
`"Ah, I think I might have gone to Odawara Castle on a field trip once. `
`It really was a wonderful castle." `
`"Yeah, I also went there. `
`Even though I live in a Western-style house, it's true that Japanese people feel calmer with a Japanese layout!" `
`"Uu-. `
`Castles are boring. `
`Theme parks are better. `
`Uu-!" `
`"I see, I see. Okay! `
`If we find the gold, the great Battler-sama will generously reserve a whole theme park for a day and let you play in it! `
`.........Still, Odawara Castle, huh? `
`The hidden gold of Odawara Castle... `
`Oho?! `
`It's actually starting to sound pretty good!" `
`"Hahahahaha! `
`Well, we figured out that much two years ago. `
`The village down the river where the sweetfish swim in Odawara. `
`We figured it was probably somewhere near Odawara Castle. `
`The problem is the next line. `
`Okay, let's see where Battler's strange reasoning can take him." `
`Jessica grinned broadly. `
`She seemed to be implying that she would've solved the puzzle long ago if it was that easy. `
`...Damn it, `
`I'll definitely find it and keep it all for myself! `
`"The fourth line. `
`...In that village, look for the shore the two will tell you of. `
`.........I don't know what it means by "the two", but anyway, the shore... `
`......What does it mean by the shore?! `
`No, wait, `
`...is there any place near there with "shore" or {ruby:kishi:{p:0:å²¸}} in its name?" `
`"Ummm, `
`...I've heard there's a place called Sogakishi in Odawara." `
`"Huh?! `
`Wow, `
`you sure know a lot about it! `
`Heheh, what could that mean? `
`Shannon-chan, are you trying to solve the riddle and get the gold too? `
`That makes us rivals!" `
`"I-It's not like I'm interested in gold... `
`It's just that...George-sama told me about it before..." `
`"That's because we reached the same conclusion two years ago. `
`We even went to the trouble of laying out a map and looking it up!" `
`"It was about five kilometers to the north of Odawara. `
`We definitely found a place called Sogakishi there. `
`...However, after that, we get stuck. `
`The fifth line doesn't say where the key is hidden in that place. `
`Maria-chan, could you read it for us?" `
`"...Uu-. `
`......There sleeps the... `
`key to the... `
`Golden Land. `
`Uu-! `
`I could read it!" `
`"Sogakishi is probably large, and there wasn't ever any house built there by the Ushiromiya family. `
`Not much we can do to find a key in such a vast area without any hints." `
`"You're right. `
`...And without the key, we can't advance to the next line. `
`George-aniki, what kind of place is Sogakishi?" `
`"Let's see... `
`I've never been there, so I don't really know, but according to the map, it's in the mountains. `
`I'm pretty sure it was at the base of Mt. Asama." `
`"......Hmmmm. `
`Something doesn't feel right. `
`You'd expect a riddle pointing the way to hidden gold to be a bit more exact. `
`I get the feeling that even the part about Sogakishi was a mistake." `
`"Well, I think it could be Sogakishi. `
`It could be talking about some house that Grandfather lived in when he was a kid that we don't know about. `
`After all, the first line mentioned his beloved hometown. `
`...Shannon, you've served Grandfather alcohol and stuff lots of times, right? `
`Hasn't he ever talked to you about his past?" `
`"...The Master almost never speaks of the past. `
`...However, he talks of the Great Kanto Earthquake as though it was someone else's story, `
`so he may have been living far away from the Kanto area." `
`"The Ushiromiya family may have been living in Odawara, but not all of the branch families were. `
`Grandfather often called himself part of a branch of a branch family, `
`the least connected to the successor." `
`"And that means... `
`the beloved hometown might not even be Odawara at all...!" `
`"I've never heard anything about Grandfather's hometown. `
`And I doubt he'd actually tell me if I asked." `
`"If the so-called beloved hometown isn't referring to the Ushiromiya family's roots, then the Odawara theory is wrong from the beginning. `
`Of course, this doesn't completely remove the possibility that it was Sogakishi. `
`For example, perhaps he lived in Odawara when he was very young, but then moved far away later." `
`"Uu-... `
`I don't understand what you're all talking about. `
`Uu-." `
`Maria had been completely left out of the conversation, and she now sat puffing out her cheeks in boredom. `
`"So, basically, `
`if we can't even agree on the starting point for this dice game of gold, we're totally stuck. `
`.........But wait... `
`After the first five lines, the thing we end up finding is a key, right? `
`Even if you don't have a key, it's always possible to bust through a door. `
`Can't we just skip the first five lines and start figuring out the rest?" `
`"Ooh... `
`I hadn't thought of that. `
`Oh well, we're just wasting time anyway. `
`Let's hear the rest of Battler's reasoning!" `
`"...But in the next part, it gets dark really fast..." `
`Shannon-chan frowned slightly. `
`After looking back at Maria's notebook to recall what was written there, `
`...yeah, I was forced to agree. `
`"On the first twilight, offer the six chosen by the key as sacrifices... `
`It sure does get horrible quickly." `
`"On the second twilight, it says to tear apart the two who are close. `
`Does that mean to make them break off their loving relationship? `
`Or does it mean to literally tear them apart? `
`I don't know, but either way, it's pretty disgusting." `
`"Even if we set that second line aside, it mentions 6 people for the first twilight, `
`then 5 people for the fourth through eighth twilights, `
`so at least 11 people must be sacrificed." `
`"Uu-. `
`They're sacrifices to revive {f:5:Beatrice}!" `
`"...I see, sacrifices to restore the witch... `
`Yeah, that's what it'd mean. `
`Near the end, the witch'll be revived on the ninth twilight... `
`...That last part is guaranteed." `
`".........On the ninth twilight, the witch shall revive, and none shall be left alive. `
`...So everyone will die in the end." `
`"And after that, the tenth twilight is the goal line. `
`Not sure how you're supposed to reach the Golden Land if everyone's dead by then." `
`"...Depending how you interpret it, the traveler who holds the key may or may not be included in the "none shall be left alive" part." `
`"But at the end, there's something pretty interesting. `
`After reaching the goal, `
`the witch gives out four treasures. `
`One shall be all the gold. `
`The problem is the next one. `
`It says the dead souls will be resurrected, right? `
`Doesn't that sound like it means everyone who died in the earlier lines?" `
`"......If you put it like that, then the part about reviving lost love `
`might refer to the pair torn apart on the second twilight." `
`"That's right. `
`And the fourth one refers to the ninth twilight. `
`The fourth treasure is putting the witch, revived on the ninth twilight, to sleep." `
`"If we put a happy spin on all this, `
`it'll be hectic with people dying and breaking up all over the place, but it'll all be made right in the end. `
`The awakened witch will sleep again, ...and everything'll be like it was at the start, except with a huge pile of gold." `
`"The witch must be pretty busy, what with all the killing, reviving, breaking up, and reuniting people." `
`"Not to mention waking up and sleeping. `
`Hahahahaha." `
`"Sheesh, just when the tale of the hidden gold was getting interesting, it all gets pretty dubious once the witch starts showing up." `
`"Too true. Ahahahahahaha!" `
`I laughed along with Jessica. `
`After all, the idea of a witch was just too ridiculous. `
`...Of course, once we started laughing like that, Maria, who believed in the witch, got angry. `
`"Uu-! `
`The witch is incredible! `
`She can do anything with magic! `
`Even kill. `
`Even bring back to life. `
`Even give love, even take it. `
`She can fly in the sky, can become invisible, can even make gold and bread out of nothing! `
`Uu-! `
`Uu-! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!!" `
`"Erk, dang... `
`My bad, ...we were just joking!" `
`Jessica apologized, sticking out her tongue, but Maria didn't accept it. `
`She grabbed her notebook back out of my hands and, opening to some other pages, tried to prove that the witch existed. `
`Those pages had colorful drawings of witches on them... `
`and well conveyed the fantastical image Maria had of witches. `
`It wasn't the normal sinister image of a crooked-nose hag flying around on a broom, `
`but a dreamlike person with unnatural powers, who could do anything and wore a beautiful dress. `
`It was just what you'd expect from an imaginative young girl. `
`Flitting through the sky, crossing a rainbow, `
`dancing around all night with a teacup and a teapot that would never get empty no matter how much you poured out of it. `
`With a flourish of her staff, the stars in the sky would become candy and pour down, `
`and flowers that produced sweets would bud by the roadside. `
`......To Maria, witches were the only concept that could embody the magical dream that so captivated her. `
`As she grew older, it was the last remaining thing that could give richness to her dull and plain everyday life. `
`That's why Maria believed in witches. `
`She didn't want that dream of hers to be tarnished. `
`That's why she didn't want anyone to tarnish the epitaph, `
`which affirmed the existence of witches. `
`Because the witch named {f:5:Beatrice} is Maria's dream... `
`"To Maria-chan, the epitaph isn't a guide to the hidden gold, `
`but magic to revive the witch." `
`So it was the single link between Maria and the witch. `
`Maria was very angry and clung to George-aniki. `
`Jessica and I scratched our heads and apologized. `
`...It might not be possible to smooth things over again like the time she got mad in front of the portrait. `
`Maria didn't seem willing to be easily consoled. `
`Unlike Jessica and I, who hung our heads wondering what to do, Shannon-chan timidly opened her mouth. `
`"Umm, `
`.........Maria-sama, did you know...? `
`There's a ghost story about {f:5:Beatrice} that has been passed down amongst the servants." `
`"......Uu-?" `
`"A-Ah, yeah, that's right! `
`Shannon, tell us about it. `
`I don't really know, but it's apparently pretty famous among the servants." `
`"What is this? `
`A ghost story?" `
`"Yes. `
`It seems it's a story from before we were born. `
`I also heard about it from my mother." `
`"...Yes. `
`It has been passed down since the time of the mansion's construction. `
`...The servants of that time whispered that the mansion had two Masters, `
`one of the Day and one of the Night." `
`The tale that Shannon told was just like a typical campfire ghost story. `
`If there was a forest with a witch living inside it, `
`...then of course the witch would come pay the mansion a visit from time to time. `
`At some point, this ghost story naturally sprouted up between the servants. `
`"When people do the rounds a second time to check doors, windows and locks that were supposedly closed, they'd find some of them left open. `
`Lights that were supposed to be off were turned on, `
`and lights that were supposed to be on went out. `
`Things left lying around would disappear, `
`and things would appear when no one had any memory of putting them there. `
`When any of these things happened, the old servants would say that the witch had visited the mansion, invisible, and was playing pranks." `
`"Uu-! `
`See, she exists! `
`{f:5:Beatrice} exists!!" `
`"Yeah, she exists. `
`Long ago, it was always right before leaving for school that I wasn't able to find my bag, and stuff..." `
`Maria puffed out her chest with an "uu-uu-" as though this was final proof of the witch's existence. `
`If I opened my mouth, Maria would probably be hurt again, so I didn't. `
`...I mean, you hear this kind of story everywhere. `
`Depending on the place, they might blame it on a dwarf or an elf. `
`The only difference is that they call it a witch on this island. `
`Of course, walking around a vast, elegant mansion at night would be a little unsettling. `
`It's an island devoid of people. `
`Since the mansion is so drafty, walking around on the night of a thunderstorm would certainly be eerie. `
`"In addition, some servants have also seen will-o'-the-wisps and glittering butterflies dancing around. `
`...Kanon-kun also saw something like that when he went patrolling one night. `
`And recently, you often hear servants talking about strange footsteps heard inside the mansion near midnight. `
`We've whispered together that the {f:5:Beatrice}-sama in the portrait sometimes makes herself invisible and walks through the mansion. `
`...It happened a while ago, `
`but even I have heard footsteps while patrolling at night that resemble these stories." `
`"......Whew. `
`That's scary..." `
`"Ah, `
`...but there's nothing to be afraid of. `
`{f:5:Beatrice}-sama is another ruler of this mansion, separate from the Master. `
`So, there's no need to be unnaturally afraid. If you respect her, I hear she won't do anything bad." `
`"However, she can be quite terrifying if you don't respect her, right?" `
`"...Correct. `
`I've heard that, just before I began working here, `
`someone who spoke badly about {f:5:Beatrice}-sama fell down the stairs and quit after receiving a large injury to their back. `
`Because of that, there was a rumor between the servants that {f:5:Beatrice}-sama's anger had been brought down upon this person..." `
`"Uu-... `
`Anger will definitely be brought down on Battler and Jessica... `
`Uu-..." `
`"I-I-I'm sorry! `
`I don't want her anger brought down upon me! `
`I apologize, Maria. `
`Of course, I also apologize to the witch. `
`I'm sorry, {f:5:Beatrice}-sama. Please forgive an outsider's nonsense." `
`"I'll apologize as well. `
`I'm sorry, {f:5:Beatrice}-sama. `
`.........Will the witch be able to forgive us now?" `
`"...Uu-. `
`Don't know. `
`Witches are fickle, so they forgive when they want to, and don't when they don't. `
`Uu- `
`"That's no good... `
`Maria-chan, isn't there some kind of good luck charm that could prevent Battler-kun and Jessica-chan from suffering {f:5:Beatrice}-sama's wrath? `
`Maybe something that can block against magic?" `
`By relying on Maria, who was proud of knowing the most about witches, George was trying to revive her self-esteem. `
`...Once again, I've gotta admire his ability to calm kids down. `
`After taking a moment to cross her arms and seriously ponder whether there might be a charm that could save us, `
`she started flipping through the pages in her notebook. `
`I'd thought it was just a scribbled diary, `
`......but there also seemed to be quite a few pages that looked like they'd come from a book on black magic. `
`Maria solemnly considered a group of these pages, which contained things that looked like magic circles. `
`.........Apparently, Grandfather wasn't the only one with a black magic hobby. `
`When Maria finally found what she was looking for, `
`she snapped the notebook shut and threw it into her handbag. She then began fishing through that bag's contents. `
`There seemed to be various jumbled up things in there. `
`After a while, she took out various pieces of junkâalthough they were probably important magical items to Mariaâ `
`and repeatedly threw them back in, saying they were wrong. `
`It was all a little humorous, just like when Doraemon took out the wrong tool. `
`Finally, she seemed to discover what she was looking for. `
`With a face that was unimaginably cheery when compared to the intense expression she had worn until now, she held "those" out to Jessica and me. `
`"Uu-!" `
`I grabbed it...and saw that it was a very cheap-looking charm. `
`It looked like a bracelet made from a plastic rosary, `
`...with a scorpion-themed medal attached. `
`Haven't you ever seen those cheap, zodiac-themed accessories? `
`The kind you might win in a crane game at an arcade. `
`It really looked like something like that. `
`There were two of them. `
`Probably one for me and one for Jessica. `
`...However, the very fact that there were two of them made them feel even more like cheap, manufactured goods, `
`making it pretty hard to think of them as magical items. `
`"You're giving these to me and Battler?" `
`"Uu-! `
`With these charms, you don't even need to worry about {f:5:Beatrice}! `
`Because scorpions have the power to ward off magic!" `
`"Huh, really? `
`Didn't know scorpions could do that." `
`"Uu-, Battler doesn't believe! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!" `
`I'd said too much and angered Maria again... `
`Maria took out her notebook again, `
`pointing out various pages as she went on and on about how the scorpion had such incredible holy power that it had been used in magic-repelling magical circles since ancient times. `
`"......Ah, I've heard about that from some of the other young servants. `
`Something about how the scorpion is drawn as a magic-repelling symbol in sorcery..." `
`"Huh, really...!" `
`"Uu-! `
`The scorpion protects against bad magic and calamity. `
`And emerald brings peace to the heart. `
`Therefore, its effects are two-fold! `
`Uu-!" `
`"It's true. `
`The scorpion wraps around the emerald and protects it. `
`Yes, that certainly does sound like it'd work well." `
`I really wanted to make fun of those worthless looking charms, `
`but as I watched Maria explaining with all of her heart and realized that she'd found them for our sakes, `
`I started to feel like it might actually work, even if it was just a prize from some game center. `
`The material quality of the charm didn't matter. `
`What mattered was the strength of her feelings. `
`Even I don't think of myself as the sort of loser who'd laugh at something like that. `
`"Okay, thank you. `
`I apologized to {f:5:Beatrice}-sama, but even if I do end up getting cursed, I'll be safe now thanks to Maria's charm. `
`Right, Jessica?" `
`"Yeah, that's right! `
`Thanks, Maria." `
`"Uu-! `
`Wear it on your arm when you want your heart to be at peace. `
`Put it in your wallet and your money won't decrease! `
`If you hang it from a doorknob, bad things can't get in! `
`It's a really convenient charm!" `
`"What an incredible effect. `
`If Maria-sama gives it her confident seal of approval, then it surely must be reliable." `
`Shannon-chan clapped her hands together, and Maria stuck out her chest. `
`She was totally in a good mood again. `
`It's probably best if we let her lead the conversation a bit longer, if it'll keep her in such a good mood. `
`Come to think of it, she looked a bit bored when we were getting excited about the hidden gold, probably because she couldn't keep up. `
`While eating the cookies Kumasawa-san had baked, Jessica and I asked Maria this and that about black magic. `
`Maria happily chatted away in response to our questions. `
`Each time, George-aniki and Shannon-chan would act surprised or chime in. `
`The clouds in the sky grew darker and darker, but we cousins really enjoyed communicating freely after a year of separation... `
`"...Nn? `
`Did I just feel a drop on my forehead?" `
`"Huh? `
`I wonder." `
`As George-aniki rubbed his forehead, he looked up at the sky. `
`Considering the color of the sky and the dampness of the air, it wouldn't have been odd for a raindrop to hit him. `
`The wind also seemed to have grown a bit stronger. `
`"Uu-? `
`I didn't feel a drop. `
`Only I didn't. `
`Uu-!" `
`"Don't worry, neither did I. `
`Anyway, I'm sure it'll rain so much tonight that everyone'll get to feel plenty of raindrops." `
`"That's right. `
`Maybe we should head back soon..." `
`Shannon-chan looked down at her watch. `
`It was probably well into the evening by now. `
`"Is it already time for you to return to your work?" `
`"Yes. `
`...Thank you very much... `
`for allowing me to enjoy some time together with you all." `
`"Tell Kumasawa-san thanks for the cookies. `
`Okay everyone, help out with the cleanup." `
`Shannon-chan declined our help, saying that this was a servant's job, `
`but picking up a dropped fork before the waitress has to is like my purpose in life. `
`We folded up the blanket, gathered up the trash, and helped clean everything up. `
`"Uu-! `
`The trash is getting awaaay! `
`Uu-uu-!!" `
`"I won't let it escape, I'll grab it before Maria does!" `
`"Uu-!! `
`I'll grab it! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!" `
`"Maria! `
`Don't get your shoes wet, you'll get in trouble!" `
`To Maria, chasing after some trash sent flying by the powerful winds was just another game. `
`By the time we finished, the wind was blowing pretty strongly. `
`Probably a good time to head back. `
`"You've all helped me out a lot. `
`Thank you very much." `
`"...It looks like you're really out of time. `
`It's okay if you head back first." `
`George-aniki perceived from her hurried appearance that very little of her free time was left. `
`"Genji-san's very strict about time. `
`If you don't show up where you're supposed to be at the right time, I bet he'll be pissed." `
`"We'll see you later. `
`Do your best with your work." `
`"Y-Yes! `
`......Then if you will excuse me." `
`After making a respectful bow, Shannon-chan ran towards the rose garden. `
`"Okay, let's head back to the guesthouse. `
`We can watch TV or something and relax a little." `
`"Uu-! `
`Wanna watch TV! `
`Wanna watch TV, uu-!" `
`"Then it's decided. `
`Let's all head back and watch TV together." `
`Maria, who wasn't done having fun, agreed once television was mentioned. `
`We climbed up the gentle stairs and returned to the rose garden. `
`The wind had grown very strong, and roses shook throughout the garden like ripples on the water. `
`This might be our last chance to see these beautiful roses... `
`I'll bet tonight's typhoon ruins them... `
`"These roses might be done in by tonight's winds." `
`"You're right. `
`Still, I think the roses were pretty lucky. `
`After all, they got to welcome all of you before the typhoon." `
`"All flowers lose their petals eventually. `
`But that means we can admire them even more when they're in bloom." `
`"That's right. `
`...Maria, burn this image into your eyes. `
`At this moment, they're the best roses of the year." `
`"Uu-. `
`Burned into eyes." `
`Right then, Maria suddenly clapped her hands. `
`It looked like she'd remembered something. `
`"......My rose... `
`The typhoon will send it flying. `
`......Uu-!" `
`"Oh, you mean that sad-looking rose George-aniki marked with a ribbon?" `
`Maria apparently remembered where the rose was. `
`She ran at full speed. `
`The rest of us followed her. `
`"............Uu-? `
`Uu-." `
`"Where was that again...? `
`I'm sure it was somewhere around here." `
`We searched everywhere around that area, but it was only a single flower among all of these roses, after all. `
`Even though we knew it was somewhere close by, we weren't able to find it. `
`The winds making up the typhoon's front lines made roses throughout the garden undulate. `
`It was almost like it was teasing us by making the location of Maria's rose impossible to find... `
`"Maybe it wasn't here... `
`Let's try spreading out a bit in our search." `
`"Sounds good. `
`Let's go for strength in numbers. `
`.........Hmm? `
`What's up, Maria?" `
`As we made to split up and search, Maria tugged on my jacket with an unhappy face. `
`......You could tell that she didn't want us to leave that spot. `
`"What is it? What's wrong?" `
`"......Uu-. `
`My rose is here. `
`It's here...!" `
`"But it's actually not, right...? `
`Maybe it was on the other side of the flower bed. `
`If we all look, we'll find it fast, okay?" `
`"Uu-!! `
`It's here! `
`My rose is here!! `
`Look for it! `
`Loooook fooor iiit!! `
`Uuu--!!" `
`Maria stomped her feet in irritation. `
`...She pointed at that spot and said it was definitely there, but in actuality, it wasn't. `
`Even so, Maria got mad when we said we were going to search elsewhere. `
`...We were at a loss for what to do. `
`For a while, `
`we had to stay near Maria and pretend to search through that rose thicket. `
`"......Uu-. `
`Uu-...! `
`Not here. `
`......Not here! `
`Not here! `
`Uuu--!!" `
`Maybe she's saying that it should be here but isn't. `
`Maria became increasingly irritated... `
`"...Oh man, `
`Maria's really losing her temper." `
`"Sometimes, Maria starts to really care about really pointless stuff. `
`If she gets what she wants, that's okay, but..." `
`"You can't find something that isn't there... `
`That's not good..." `
`Just when we were at a loss of what to do, `
`Maria called out in a loud voice. `
`"Mama!! `
`Uu-uu-!!" `
`We could see Aunt Rosa in the direction Maria was waving her hand. `
`Maybe she wanted to look at the garden one more time before the typhoon came, `
`or maybe she had some business at the guesthouse. `
`Aunt Rosa was coming from the mansion. `
`She quickly noticed her daughter's voice and came over. `
`"My, my, what happened, everyone? `
`Are you looking for something?" `
`"Look for it! `
`Mama, you look for my rose too! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!!" `
`"Your rose?" `
`"We found an unhealthy rose around here and marked it." `
`"We tied a candy wrapper around it. `
`...But Maria, if I remember correctly, it was growing right in front and really stood out, didn't it? `
`Unless it grew legs and ran off somewhere, it must've been somewhere else. `
`Maybe you remembered it wrong." `
`"Uu-!! `
`It is here!! `
`Iiit iiis heeere!! `
`Battler doesn't believe! `
`Uu-uu-!!" `
`"How many times do I have to tell you to stop saying "uu-uu-" before you'll understand?! `
`Mama will look for it, so stay quiet!!" `
`I'd never seen Aunt Rosa be anything other than kind and gentle, so her anger surprised me a bit. `
`Aunt Rosa began searching as well, so we went along with her for the time being, `
`but we were already more than sure that it wasn't around here. `
`...So, it didn't take long for Aunt Rosa to realize that too. `
`"The rose isn't here. `
`Did you mistake this place for somewhere else? `
`There are so many roses around-" `
`"Uu-!! `
`Uuuu---!!! `
`That's wrong!! `
`It is here!! `
`Mama doesn't believe! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!!!" `
`"I already believed you and looked hard for it, didn't I?! `
`But it isn't here!" `
`"Uu-uu-!! `
`But it is here!! `
`It is here but it isn't!! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!!" `
`"Then someone must have ripped it out! `
`Anyway, stop saying "uu-uu"!!" `
`"Uu-uu-uu-!! `
`Who ripped out my rose, who did?!?! `
`Give it back, give it back!! `
`Uu-uu-!! `
`Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!!" `
`"How should I know?!! `
`Stop it, stop saying "uu-uu-"!!" `
`Aunt Rosa slapped Maria's left cheek with her palm. `
`In that instant, Maria was shocked into silence. `
`Of course, it was only for an instant. `
`When Maria realized that her wish was being rejected, she started yelling even louder. `
`"Uu-uu-!! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!! `
`My rose! `
`My rose!! `
`Uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-!!!" `
`"Didn't I tell you to stop that weird habit?!! `
`That's why all the kids in your class make fun of you!! `
`Cut it out!!" `
`Once again, her palm slapped Maria's cheek. `
`This time she didn't go silent. `
`She choked as she started crying...and began to bawl in an increasingly loud voice... `
`Aunt Rosa was clearly irritated and lifted her hand once more to try and shut her daughter up... `
`"A-Aunt Rosa... `
`Now, now... She's just a little kid, so there's no reason to get so serious...ihihi." `
`I tried to cut in with a bitter smile, rubbing my hands together, `
`...but Aunt Rosa glared at me with a serious face, and I realized that I should've stayed out of this. `
`"I'm sorry, but could the rest of you go back to your room for a bit? `
`I need to have a little talk with Maria." `
`"Uu-uu-uu-!! `
`Nobody believes in my rose!! `
`Even though it was here!! `
`Uu-uu-!! `
`Look for it!! `
`Looook fooor iiit!! `
`Here, it was here!! `
`Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!!" `
`"But it's not here!! `
`So you must've confused this place for somewhere else, right?!" `
`"Uu-uu-uu-uu-!! `
`It is here!! `
`It's definitely here!! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!!" `
`"Then it disappeared!! `
`Give it up!!" `
`"Why?! `
`Why did it disappear? `
`Why, why?! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!!!" `
`"I don't know that!! `
`So stop saying "uu-uu-"!!" `
`Aunt Rosa once again raised her hand, overcome by emotion, and slapped Maria's cheek. `
`It was strong enough to knock Maria over. `
`"H-Hey, Aunt Rosa, `
`even if she is your daughter, violence isn't the answer..." `
`I stepped between them to protect Maria, who was still on the ground, crying "uu-uu-". `
`......I knew that, as an outsider, problems between parent and child were none of my business. `
`But I wasn't brought up to just silently observe something like this... `
`"Don't you think it's weird, Battler-kun? `
`Are there any girls at your school who mutter "uu-uu-"?" `
`"Well, I am in high school... `
`But for an elementary schooler, I think saying "uu-uu-" is pretty cute..." `
`"Cute? `
`Saying "uu-uu-" is cute? `
`Cute?!" `
`My careless words seemed to have earned me Aunt Rosa's wrath. `
`She grabbed my collar with a terrifying expression... `
`"Don't say such nonsense!! `
`Do you know how old Maria is? `
`She's nine! `
`She's a fourth grader! `
`Not a kindergartener! `
`But she still makes that sound during class!! `
`Don't you get it?! `
`Do you know what they say about this kid when they bully her?! `
`Thanks to this weird habit, she still hasn't made a single friend! `
`Don't turn your eyes from reality and carelessly call Maria cute!! `
`Think more seriously about this kid's future!!!" `
`"Uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-!!! `
`Uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-!!!" `
`"I told you, stop making that sound!!! `
`Didn't I tell you to stop it?!!" `
`Aunt Rosa struck Maria's quivering head, from which an increasingly unhappy voice was rising. `
`I tried to stop it, but Aunt Rosa pushed me away... `
`My back hit George-aniki. `
`"......A long time ago, Aunt Rosa also thought of it as nothing more than one of Maria-chan's baby words, `
`...but now that it hasn't been fixed even midway through elementary school, she's been worrying about it a lot..." `
`"How she talks isn't really that big of a deal, right...?" `
`"She'll never make it as an adult if she's like that. `
`...So, even though it isn't fun to watch, `
`......this is a problem between parent and child." `
`".........Well, `
`even I get chewed out by Mom all the time 'cause of how I talk." `
`When they put it that way, maybe even a scene as painful as this isn't something an outsider like me should butt in on... `
`"Battler-kun, when you were a kid, didn't you have any bad habits that you couldn't fix and that got you into trouble?" `
`"......Well, one or two. `
`On Parent's Day once, I kept getting yelled at in front of everyone, and it was embarrassing as all hell." `
`"Well then, you can understand how the two of them must feel right now. `
`......I'm sure they don't want us to be here now. `
`......You understand too, don't you, Jessica-chan?" `
`".........I don't think anyone likes to be seen when they're being scolded." `
`"Let's go. `
`We'll return to the guesthouse. `
`Then, after Maria-chan comes back, `
`let's welcome her as if nothing happened. `
`That's probably for the best, isn't it?" `
`We thought George-aniki's point was probably a reasonable one, `
`and we may have been eager to use that reasonable-sounding argument as a justification to retreat from this heart-rending scene. `
`Jessica and I nodded at George-aniki, and we all left. `
`We called towards Maria, telling her that we were going to head to the guesthouse, `
`but she didn't seem to hear, and we felt sort of guilty and shameless after saying it... `
`"In that case, look by yourself as much as you want! `
`Mama doesn't care!!" `
`"Uu-!!! `
`I'll look for it! `
`I'll look for it by myself!! `
`Even if Mama doesn't care! `
`Uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-!!" `
`"Have it your way!!" `
`After blasting her with those last few words, Rosa spun on her heels and quickly returned to the mansion. `
`Maria probably viewed that as a cold gesture meant to injure. `
`But that wasn't Rosa's intention. `
`...It was because the hand with which she had so emotionally struck Maria's cheek...was still numb. `
`...It was because, if she stayed there screaming, she might again be taken over by her emotions and continue slapping her daughter's cheek over and over. `
`After Rosa left, Maria was left alone in the rose garden. `
`The wind began to blow stronger and stronger, and every once in a while, a raindrop would fall on her forehead. `
`...However, Maria couldn't leave that place. `
`Not until she found that poor, wilting rose. `
`It had definitely been there. `
`......Even so, `
`it wasn't. `
`Even though she knew the place and even though it had been there, `
`it wasn't. `
`Maria bitterly stared at the place it was supposed to be and thought frantically. `
`Maybe the angle I'm looking from is wrong. `
`Maybe the height I'm looking from is wrong. `
`......While gazing at a single point, `
`Maria repeatedly stood up, changed her position and continued to stare. `
`The wind was getting stronger and stronger...... `
`But Maria kept on looking for that rose in front of the flower bed... `
`.........Kinzo noticed the sound of the raindrops beating on the window. `
`It seemed to be pouring down thickly. `
`It had begun to rain later than the weather report had predicted. `
`Kinzo approached the window as if being summoned by the sound of the rain. `
`The sound of rain is a sound of silence. `
`That sound feels quieter than any silence... `
`and makes humans remember that, in the end, they are alone from the moment they're born to the moment they die. `
`"......You're late, {f:5:Beatrice}." `
`Were those words directed at the rainy sky...? `
`There was no one to be seen in the direction of Kinzo's gaze. `
`"......Well then, let us begin. `
`Let us begin our banquet of miracles. `
`......This island has now been cut off from the world. `
`Now there are none who can interrupt my ceremony. `
`There are many fitting sacrifices for you. `
`Four of my children. `
`Three of their companions. `
`Four of my grandchildren. `
`Me and my guests and my servants! `
`You may devour as many as you please. `
`The key of fate will select the sacrifices in accordance with the Demons' Roulette. `
`If that roulette chooses me, even I will become your sacrifice. `
`...However, because of that, `
`...because I will bet on such madness, `
`......I will most assuredly bring forth a grand miracle." `
`"...Come, devour to your heart's content...!! `
`I will achieve victory over that roulette. `
`Yes, I'll put everything on the line. `
`First, I'll return the inheritance of the Ushiromiya family. `
`Accept it!!" `
`Kinzo tore the window open, ripped a golden ring off his finger, and forcefully threw it away. `
`......At that time, the sound of thunder rang out, giving the illusion that the lightning had accepted the ring. `
`"And, ......when you are resurrected, `
`surely I will be the one who stands witness. `
`I will survive until the end and watch over you as you awaken. `
`.........So come, {f:5:Beatrice}... `
`Welcome to my banquet...! `
`In exchange for all that I have created, show me another miracle just this once. `
`......Oooooohh, `
`...{f:5:Beatriceeeeeee}........." `
