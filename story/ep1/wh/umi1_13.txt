`The uncomfortable atmosphere continued even after those two left. `
`It was thick with the idea that simply thinking about the culprit's identity...would be the same as deciding whom to suspect. `
`...It had begun to feel like discussion of the case was itself taboo. `
`So no one mentioned the case, at least out loud. `
`......However, those thoughts were what filled our minds. `
`All that we couldn't say aloud made our heads feel like they were going to explode... `
`So, at least on the outside, the parlor had once again regained its calm mood. `
`Everything was left unsettled. `
`"......It feels like the rain's gotten a little lighter." `
`"Uu-...? `
`Still pouring down. `
`Uu-..." `
`"Even if it did stop, there's no boat on this island. `
`...But it'd be nice if the boat came quickly tomorrow. `
`I've had enough of this Western mansion vacation, ihihi." `
`"Mom, when will the boat come tomorrow?" `
`"Normally, the boat to take them back would arrive at 3:00 today. `
`They probably sent us a phone call to say that they would come after the typhoon passed, but unfortunately, the phones aren't working... `
`...But they aren't children over there. `
`They were told to both drop off and collect our guests, `
`so they will most likely arrive first thing tomorrow morning, `
`...probably about 9:00, I believe." `
`It was completely black outside. `
`When I looked at the clock, I realized that it was just past 7:00. `
`I was starting to get hungry... `
`In the kitchen, Kumasawa was cooking enthusiastically. `
`She had laid out a variety of dishes, and while they didn't match the level of Gohda's artful cooking, they were still quite gorgeous. `
`It was an act of kindness from Kumasawa, who was trying to enliven everyone's low spirits with some food. `
`Kumasawa wasn't nearly as talented as a professional cook like Gohda, but she was far from unskilled. `
`...On the contrary, since she had been brought up in a fishing village, the simple food she created was sometimes highly praised. `
`Kanon arranged the food Kumasawa had finished creating on plates, under her direction. `
`Kanon also helped in the kitchen sometimes, but since he was rarely placed in that role, he was slightly awkward, even though he tried his best... `
`Self-conscious about the fact that he couldn't cleverly arrange the food, Kanon's expression darkened slightly. `
`But Kumasawa smiled as though everything was fine. `
`"Hohohoh, it's arranged beautifully. `
`Kanon-kun, aren't you skilled." `
`"......If it had been Shannon nee-san, `
`...it would look even more beautiful..." `
`Kanon stopped arranging the food for a bit and hung his head... `
`Shannon was the one who always assisted Kumasawa in her cooking. `
`...Tonight, Kanon was doing it instead. `
`...And as he remembered Shannon's face and her brutal end, he grimaced... `
`"......Forget that for now..." `
`Genji spoke kindly to Kanon as he advanced a pawn. `
`...Nanjo had escaped from the parlor once the mood had grown sour, and Genji had become his opponent in a game of chess upon Nanjo's request. `
`"......Yes. `
`...I will forget it for now." `
`"...Indeed. `
`That is probably for the best." `
`Genji purposefully refrained from facing Kanon as he spoke. `
`...He did so because he understood that it might make things tougher on Kanon if he noticed that someone was looking at his eyes. `
`Nanjo also understood that and held back any thoughtless words. `
`"...I wonder where Kinzo-san has gone... `
`...I hope that he is safe, but..." `
`"......I do not know. `
`...However, I believe everything has proceeded as the Master has hoped and arranged for. `
`...To distrust that would exceed my role as furniture in service to the Master." `
`"...Aren't you scared, Genji-san...? `
`I am frightened that something bad will occur again tonight..." `
`"......I have nothing to be afraid of. `
`...I serve the Ushiromiya family, and that is all." `
`Nanjo sighed through his nose and made a carefully considered move. `
`...Nanjo was very slightly dubious. `
`...Could Genji possibly be thinking that he'd be left out of this? `
`He couldn't even imagine what was happening inside this mansion. `
`...But he definitely couldn't deny the possibility that Kinzo had devised something. `
`...If you liken this island to chess, Kinzo had opened the game, and as a result, six pieces had been defeated. `
`......Could it be that Genji was calm because he believed he alone was on the outside of the chessboard, and therefore safe? `
`Nanjo thought about it. `
`......Isn't everyone just a piece on this chessboard, lined up equally, without any exceptions? `
`......Wasn't even Genji, who had gained more of Kinzo's trust than anyone... `
`no, who was confident of his position as Kinzo's only close friend, `
`...just another one of the pieces laid out on the chessboard? `
`"......Genji-san, `
`...I am truly frightened about tonight. `
`...I hope with all my heart that we will still be safe when tomorrow morning comes..." `
`The guest room Eva and Hideyoshi moved into had originally been built to house guests before the guesthouse's construction. `
`So until a few years ago, they had stayed in these rooms every family conference and were very familiar with them. `
`This room was just like a room at a hotel, with a bedroom and a bathroom, `
`so even though they were still shut in, it was far more comfortable than the parlor. `
`"Guess it's true you can relax more when you're alone with your family. `
`...Maybe it'd be better if everyone else also shut themselves in guest rooms and locked the doors." `
`"Natsuhi nee-san said that no one could leave the parlor, throwing her weight around. `
`I'm sure no one will be able to talk back. `
`She's always been treated so coldly, so now that Nii-san's dead, she's getting excited about finally having so much power. `
`...Seriously, how shameless can she be." `
`"...Come now, don't say that. `
`Natsuhi-san's doin' pretty well. `
`No need to jump on her like that. `
`......And about that receipt earlier, you went too far." `
`"...Come on. `
`If I hadn't said it there, there wouldn't be another good time to say it..." `
`Eva, sulking cutely and looking at the television, sat alongside Hideyoshi, who was lying on the bed. `
`"Still, ......we haven't been alone like this for quite some time." `
`"You're right. `
`Come to think of it, both you and I have gotten pretty old. `
`Since George was born, everything's gone by in the blink of an eye." `
`"...It really has. `
`...I wonder if we were too hasty in having a child." `
`Eva's eyes looked like they were staring off into the distance. `
`...Yes, she had thought of it as a once-in-a-lifetime chance. `
`...Her older brother Krauss had been unable to father a child for quite some time. `
`Six years passed after his marriage to Natsuhi without any signs of pregnancy, which didn't please Kinzo at all. `
`Eva herself had thought that, `
`since her name would be moved outside the Ushiromiya register when she got married anyway, it didn't matter whether a Successor to the Headship was born or not. `
`And then, one day, `
`...she had a heavenly revelation. `
`...Or maybe it was the whisperings of the devil that she had listened to in her greed. `
`If she could give birth to a successor first, wouldn't she be able to remain in the Ushiromiya register? `
`...If things went well, might she have a chance to inherit the Ushiromiya family herself...? `
`When she proposed this to Hideyoshi, he had approved of it instantly. `
`...This wasn't because Hideyoshi also had greedy thoughts. `
`...For Hideyoshi, who had no close relatives, `
`it was a chance for him to feel once more the long forgotten thing called family. `
`So when they got married, he hadn't fussed over which last name they were to keep...and had quickly agreed to have his name entered into the Ushiromiya family register. `
`It hadn't been easy to persuade Kinzo, but as his daughter, Eva knew Kinzo's personality well. `
`...So, by choosing the time when Kinzo was most dissatisfied with Natsuhi, `
`she was magnificently able to make him accept Hideyoshi as an adopted son-in-law. `
`...Looking at Hideyoshi, who had achieved success after starting from nothing, Kinzo might have seen a little bit of himself. `
`He quickly grew to like Hideyoshi and approved his transfer into the Ushiromiya register... `
`George would eventually become the Successor to the Ushiromiya family. `
`They had raised him strictly with that purpose in mind. `
`He had been worth their while and had grown into a fabulous young man, who wouldn't disappoint no matter where he went. `
`...That was why he had not been permitted to fall in love with a servant like Shannon. `
`...So when she'd learned that Shannon was dead and the engagement was now invalid, `
`...though part of her had still been shocked by the gruesome crime, `
`part of her had also been relieved that her dear George wouldn't be stolen by some servant girl... `
`"......... `
`......I... `
`...have hated Krauss nii-san since long ago. `
`He was so full of himself, always swaggering around. `
`So proud that he would one day become the Head. `
`...So I wanted to get back at him. `
`...Was that just a childish emotion...? `
`But in the end, that emotion guided my entire life. `
`If that had been all, then it would have been fine! `
`...But because of that emotion, I got you and George involved. I used you." `
`"......Eva, don't blame yourself for that." `
`Hideyoshi got up and held Eva's shoulder. `
`...She could feel a warm understanding from him. `
`"...Well, I reached the halfway point in my life long ago. `
`...But you know, I have absolutely no regrets about how I've lived my life. `
`Not one." `
`"......I think that since I've been with you, Eva, I've been able to relish an enjoyable life that other men never will. `
`...After I lost my relatives in the war, you reminded me what the warmth of family is. `
`So I'm grateful to the Ushiromiya family and think of it as my only one." `
`"......In this life I've led with you, not a single thing's been wasted. `
`It's really been a fun life up 'til today." `
`"...Thank you, `
`......darling." `
`Eva hung her head, burying her face in Hideyoshi's chest... `
`...Probably, no one in the parlor could even imagine that this side of Eva existed. `
`"I'm the one who should be thankin' you. `
`Until today, there hasn't been a single day I've regretted bein' with you!" `
`".........Me too. `
`I'm so glad...to have you by my side." `
`"George is already a fine adult. `
`Even if I don't look out for him, he's a man who could do his job well on his own. `
`...I wonder. `
`Around New Year's, do you want to go spend some time in the Maldives? `
`Just us, no one else." `
`"...No waaay. `
`Aren't you always saying that you're so busy responding to New Year's cards that you don't even sleep...?" `
`"None of that this New Year's! `
`I won't read New Year's cards. `
`I'll just stay quiet and check to see if I've won the New Year's lottery. `
`It'd sure be nice if we won a color TV this year!" `
`"No waaay... `
`I don't want to waste time checking the lottery while in the Maldives..." `
`"Then none of that either! `
`...How does it sound? Just the two of us, taking it easy like when we were newlyweds, just before George was born." `
`"......Yes. `
`...In that case, fine..." `
`"I hear the Maldives are wonderful. `
`An island with nothin' on it, surrounded by beaut'ful coral reefs and cottages lined up over the water..." `
`"......Like when we were newlyweds, you say? Starting when...?" `
`"As soon as I've finished up some business. `
`I won't know 'til I ask the travel agency, but probably before New Year's Eve-" `
`"No way. `
`......Right now, `
`...I want to go right now." `
`Eva nagged at his lips in a peevish, yet flirtatious manner... `
`The only sounds that filled the room were the distant voice of the announcer on the news, which Hideyoshi had left on, and the obnoxious pounding of the rain against the window... `
`There was a knock on the door, and Genji-san entered. `
`".........Madam, `
`dinner has been prepared. `
`Will you eat in here again...?" `
`"...Yes. `
`Have it brought here. `
`Is Doctor Nanjo still in the kitchen?" `
`".........Yes. `
`He has said he wishes to carefully deliberate over his next move. `
`...Do not worry, he is with the other servants." `
`"Genji-san's good enough at chess to be Grandfather's opponent. `
`I hear he's even better than Doctor Nanjo, right?" `
`"...That's right. `
`Long ago, he played against me, but he must've let me win." `
`"Maria, sounds like it'll be time to eat soon. `
`But look at you, you've been watching TV all day long and you still haven't gotten bored!" `
`"Uu-. `
`I'm always watching TV so I'm fine. `
`Uu-." `
`"Heh, Maria-chan sure is a TV kid." `
`"Food's coming, so we have to clean up the table." `
`Earlier, we had torn several pages out of Maria's notebook, and there was now a mess where everyone had been drawing together. `
`Jessica began cleaning that up quickly. `
`...Still, everyone here really can draw. `
`I'd never guessed. `
`"...Genji, `
`ask Eva-san and Hideyoshi-san whether they'd at least like to have dinner with us. `
`...Although they will probably turn us down." `
`"...Certainly." `
`"First Father, and now Eva-san... `
`It's quite hard to gather everyone to the Ushiromiya dinner table." `
`Natsuhi felt her headache start throbbing again and lightly held her temples... `
`The distance from the kitchen to the parlor wasn't that great, so Genji had gone and come back by himself, but the guest room was a little farther away. `
`Natsuhi had warned him to avoid being alone whenever possible, `
`and just now, Nanjo had also admonished him, saying it would be better if he held a little more concern for his safety. `
`...Kanon accompanied Genji, and the two of them went to visit Eva and Hideyoshi in their guest room. `
`Genji knocked on the door. `
`"...Eva-sama, Hideyoshi-sama. `
`Dinner has been prepared." `
`He waited a short while for them to come out, but there was no response. `
`"......Genji-sama, ...look at this." `
`Kanon pointed under the door. `
`......A Western‐style envelope had been inserted under i `. `
`Normally, when something was inserted this way, it'd be interpreted as a message from someone outside to someone in the room. `
`...So, since this might be a private note meant for Eva and Hideyoshi, it was not something that Kanon and Genji were supposed to take interest in. `
`...But this Western envelope... `
`was one of Kinzo's, the same kind as the one Maria had taken out last night and surprised everyone with. `
`"......... `
`...There can be no mistake. `
`It is one of the Master's envelopes." `
`"...Or could it be... `
`......" `
`Even though this was one of Kinzo's envelopes, ...the letter Maria read aloud the previous night hadn't come from Kinzo... `
`Genji continued knocking a little harder and called out in a loud voice. `
`"Eva-sama. `
`Eva-sama...! `
`It is Genji. `
`Are you there?! `
`Please answer, Eva-sama...!!" `
`But there was no response from inside. `
`Sometimes, when the servants went to call some guests for a meal, the guests would be sleeping so deeply that they wouldn't wake up. `
`...In times like that, the servants would stick a letter in the door to show that it was time to come out, and leave the guest be. `
`...But despite that, Genji beat even harder on the door and called out Eva's name. `
`However, there was no answer. `
`Kanon stuck his ear up to the door, held his breath, and listened for any sounds coming from inside... `
`"......I hear something that sounds like the television. `
`...But I don't sense anyone. `
`...The room might be empty..." `
`Genji took out a handkerchief, and, careful not to touch it with his bare hands, `
`gently pulled out the envelope that had been stuck under the door... `
`It was sealed with deep red sealing wax. `
`...Without a doubt, the mark on that sealing wax had come from the Ushiromiya Family Head's Ring... `
`"Eva-sama! `
`Eva-sama!! `
`Please, answer!! `
`Are you still in your room?!" `
`But there was still no answer... `
`There was a chance that those two were aimlessly walking around the mansion. `
`...This was the home Eva had grown up in. `
`There was plenty of reason to think that she had gone out on a casual stroll... `
`Genji groped around in his pocket and pulled out the bundle of keys, which contained the key that would open the guest room. `
`"...Genji-sama...?!" `
`Kanon also understood what this meant. `
`...They would sometimes unlock the door so they could go in and do things like make the beds, but only after they made sure the guests were out. `
`To unlock the door for any other reason, and especially to do so when there was a chance the guests hadn't given permission and might still be in there, was an action unbecoming of a servant. `
`...But Genji had decided. `
`.........If the only problem had been that his knock hadn't received a reply, he wouldn't have gone this far. `
`But the envelope under the door was doubtlessly one of Kinzo's. `
`......Or rather, one of the Western envelopes of the Ushiromiya Family Head. `
`...After last night, the sender of this envelope could be someone other than Kinzo. `
`...If this letter had been sent by someone else...... `
`"Eva-sama...! `
`My apologies. `
`Allow me to enter your room..." `
`After giving that final notice, Genji stuck one of the keys from the bundle into the keyhole. `
`There was the sound of the door unlocking. `
`......And, after slowly turning the knob, he slowly started opening the door. `
`Light seeped through the crack of the door. `
`......Were they in the room? `
`Or had they...forgotten to turn out the lights...? `
`*clank*. `
`...It was the sound of the door chain being pulled tight. `
`The chain had been secured. `
`The chain couldn't be secured from the outside. `
`So it also proved that they were in the room. `
`The sound of voices on the TV seeped out of the room. `
`...The lights, the chain, and the TV. `
`All of these things made it clear they were in the room, `
`......but there was no sign of them. `
`Genji called to Eva once again through the crack of the door. `
`But there was no answer. `
`".........Genji-sama, `
`......what should we do...?" `
`As part of their job, the servants were able to unlock almost any lock in the mansion. `
`But they had no way to open a door with a chain. `
`......The only way to get by the chain was to cut it. `
`...That was certainly not permitted as part of a servant's usual work. `
`...A creepy chill had already rushed up their backs... `
`Kanon held his breath again and tried to sense someone through the door, but even so, he was not able to sense anyone. `
`"......I will call Madam and return. `
`...Kanon, cut the chain." `
`"...Y-Yes...!" `
`As Kanon hurried away to get a cutting tool, Genji called him to a stop. `
`"Wait, Kanon...! `
`......Return to the kitchen and take Kumasawa with you. `
`You must not act alone." `
`"...Yes... `
`Certainly..." `
`It looked like Kanon was wondering why he had to do something so troublesome in the middle of this urgent situation. `
`...But Genji had said it out of wariness. `
`...He didn't care what happened to himself. `
`...But in the worst-case scenario, he didn't want anything to happen to Kanon. `
`In the kitchen, Kumasawa was piling food on the serving cart, `
`and Nanjo was waiting for Genji, apparently wanting to show him a move he'd finally thought up that might turn the tables on him. `
`...But Genji's appearance immediately told him that something was wrong. `
`"...Oh, ...what has happened, Genji-san...?" `
`"......Doctor Nanjo, my apologies, but please allow this match to be suspended for the time being. `
`......Kanon, take care of the chain. `
`Kumasawa, stop setting up dinner for now and accompany Kanon. `
`I will go over to Madam. `
`If you would come with me, Doctor Nanjo." `
`"H-Has something happened...?" `
`Genji took Nanjo, who still didn't know what was going on, and quickly left the kitchen. `
`"...Kumasawa-san, `
`my apologies, but please come with me." `
`"Wh-What has happened, Kanon-san...?" `
`Kumasawa said almost exactly the same thing as Nanjo, unable to take in the situation, and chased after Kanon, who had flown out into the hallway... `
`Taking Kumasawa with him, Kanon went to a storage room and looked through the tools packed in toolboxes and hanging all over the walls, `
`trying to find something that could be used to cut the chain. `
`"What are you looking for...? `
`...Let me help too..." `
`"...We're cutting a door chain. `
`...Where was that large wire cutter..." `
`"A door chain...? `
`Wh-Why would you do something like that...?" `
`"......The chain to Eva-sama and Hideyoshi-sama's room. `
`...Even though they should be inside, they didn't answer when we called them." `
`It took Kumasawa some time to figure out how cutting the chain and Eva and Hideyoshi not answering were connected, but she did realize that this was an urgent situation. `
`"That one will probably do the trick..." `
`Kanon took down a very large wire cutter that had been hanging on the wall. `
`It was called a cutter, but maybe it'd be easier to understand if we said it was shaped like a large pair of pliers. `
`...Kanon remembered once being warned that this dangerous tool could easily cut through one of your fingers... `
`Kanon took that and rushed up the stairs. `
`......He already knew instinctively. `
`...He should fight for every minute, every second to open it quickly. `
`......Or perhaps... `
`it was already...... `
`"Please wait, Kanon-san...! `
`Haah, ...haah...!" `
`"...Hurry!" `
`Kumasawa eventually caught up with him, gasping for breath with both hands on her knees. `
`When Kanon changed his grip on the wire cutters and looked up at the door, he let out an 'ah', struck speechless... `
`"......Wh- `
`What is...this...... `
`......Eeeeeeeep..." `
`Kumasawa screamed weakly, her face pallid... `
`That was no surprise... `
`Because, right there, ......on the door, ...just like the magic circle that had been drawn on the shutter of the rose garden storehouse, `
`there was another eerie shape drawn with a blood-like paint. `
`However, it would be odd to call this one a 'magic circle'. `
`...Because, unlike what most people would expect, it wasn't a circle with shapes drawn inside it, `
`but a slightly more complicated geometrical shape. `
`......However, those strange characters filling in the gaps, which weren't from the alphabet, were the same kind as the ones on that magic circle on the shutter... `
`But the thing that had Kanon struck speechless wasn't how eerie the magic circle was. `
`...It was that something like this hadn't been here a short while ago...!! `
`First, he had taken a trip back to the kitchen. `
`After that, he'd gone to the storage room to grab a tool and headed right back. `
`Put those together and it couldn't have been more than five minutes. `
`...How could someone add something this creepy during that period of time...?! `
`And as though it had just been drawn, `
`almost like the door itself was bleeding, several unsettling vertical red lines slowly dripped down, getting longer and longer... `
`"...Eeeeeep, ...eeeeeeeeeeeeeek...!" `
`Kumasawa's knees gave way, and she sank down on the spot. `
`...If Kumasawa hadn't done this first, then Kanon surely would have wanted to. `
`"...Be...atrice...sama........." `
`"Eeeeeeeeeek...! `
`It's the work of Beatrice-sama, how horrid, how horrid...!!" `
`"..................!" `
`Kanon gulped, then readied the wire cutter and approached the door. `
`...He didn't want to get close to this disturbing magic circle, and he really didn't want to touch the steadily dripping substance that looked like blood. `
`...But if he didn't get close, he wouldn't be able to cut the chain. `
`Fighting this cold feeling, he gulped again, and after gathering his courage, he went even closer, putting the wire cutter up against the chain. `
`...He then pressed with all of his strength, managing to cut through the chain far more easily than he'd anticipated. `
`The cut chain fell into two separate parts, which continued to clang as they swayed back and forth... `
`"......Kanon-san, `
`.........there's an envelope by your feet, `
`...and isn't that...the Master's..." `
`It looked like Kumasawa had also noticed the Western envelope at the bottom of the door. `
`And that the sealing wax had been sealed with the Head's Ring. `
`Kanon hesitated for just a second over whether he should open the letter first or check inside the room, `
`but he eventually decided on fulfilling his original purpose. `
`...Kanon pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket. `
`This was so he wouldn't leave fingerprints on the door. `
`...If his worst fears were realized, ......the police would want to investigate this room too...!! `
`He slowly pushed the door open... `
`He was able to more clearly hear the sound of the television, which had been seeping out faintly this whole time. `
`"...............Eva-sama...?" `
`Eva was lying face up on the bed, `
`...on the bed with her shoes still on...? `
`Kumasawa, who had fearfully entered after Kanon and who was hiding behind his back, screamed a short 'eeek!' again when she saw Eva like that. `
`Eva's shoes had been the first part of her that Kanon had seen, so the oddness of wearing shoes in bed was the first thing to strike him, `
`...but when Eva's head shifted into his line of sight, `
`...Kanon couldn't help but let out a short scream like Kumasawa... `
`Right in the middle of Eva's forehead...something had been... `
`......placed? `
`Something was growing there...? `
`No. `
`...Right in the center of her forehead... `
`Was it an old-fashioned knife? `
`That or some weapon like it was sticking out!!! `
`At the base of where it was stuck in, blood dripped down, staining the sheets on the other side bright red... `
`Kumasawa's knees gave way once more, and she sank down on the floor. `
`...Her mouth kept flapping open and closed, but she couldn't even scream. `
`...Eva was dead, with some kind of weapon sticking out of her forehead. `
`Both eyes were open wide, and the image of the person who killed her must have been burned into them, `
`...but the only mouth capable of naming that person had been shut for all eternity. `
`Even though her forehead was the last place they wanted to look, they couldn't tear their eyes from it... `
`Right there, the weapon was stuck into Eva's forehead, standing almost perfectly upright. `
`And on the handle was a complicated design that you wouldn't expect to see on an ordinary weapon. `
`...That thing...could be summed up with the word 'occult'. `
`...It was a vulgar object, with a design that might've been of some demon. `
`"...What about Hideyoshi-sama...? `
`...Hideyoshi-sama...!" `
`Eva was on top of her bed, but the other bed was empty. `
`...Where was Hideyoshi?! `
`After taking a backwards glance at Kumasawa, still on her knees and stupefied, he checked the bathroom just in case. `
`At the moment he opened the door, he was greeted by steam and the sound of the shower. `
`The bathroom was of the same familiar style as most hotel bathrooms. `
`When taking a shower, a waterproof curtain was used to keep water from flying out. `
`That waterproof curtain was half open... `
`...and lying tumbled down in the bathtub was Hideyoshi, completely naked, with both eyes open... `
`and pointing right at Kanon. `
`Just like Eva, a weapon with a demon-like design was stuck into his forehead. `
`Since his head had been under the shower's hot water this whole time, his face wasn't half covered and filthy with blood like Eva's had been, `
`...but the sight of him dead while still taking a shower was tragic enough...... `
`Just then, they heard Natsuhi's voice coming from the hall. `
`She was probably coming with Genji. `
`"...A-Again with this grafitti... `
`...What about this letter...? `
`What does it say inside?" `
`"I don't know, ...I haven't read it yet." `
`"......We shouldn't touch it carelessly... `
`The culprit's fingerprints might be left on it... `
`We should hand it over to the police..." `
`"......They went out of their way to leave it here. `
`I'm sure they wouldn't have left fingerprints." `
`As Natsuhi said that, she picked up the envelope. `
`...And before checking its contents, she entered the room herself, ...where she found Eva, dead. `
`"...E-Eva-san...!!!!" `
`"...Madam, ...Hideyoshi-sama is here too......" `
`"...Th-This is... `
`truly atrocious..." `
`"...Kanon, turn off the shower... `
`Don't let this be any more pitiful than it needs to be...!" `
`"...Y-Yes Ma'am." `
`Kanon gripped his handkerchief and twisted the valve, turning off the shower. `
`In the bathtub, a small jar of body soap had fallen with its cap off. `
`...It really looked like he'd been attacked while taking a shower. `
`...There was still a small splash of blood clinging to the white bathtub, and the combination of red and white made a horrible contrast. `
`"......Doctor Nanjo..." `
`"...I-I understand... `
`...No signs of postmortem lividity... `
`Rigor mortis hasn't begun either. `
`It would seem that an hour or so has passed since they were killed... `
`But even so, ...how a weapon with such a short handle could do that to the skull, `
`...I cannot imagine..." `
`Nanjo checked their pulse and their pupils, making certain of their deaths once more. `
`...As Kanon watched this businesslike treatment, he thought. `
`...Couldn't you tell at a glance that they're dead without doing all that? `
`Nanjo thought about removing the weapon, `
`but then decided it'd be better to preserve the scene and hand it over to the police, so he left it alone. `
`But a close inspection of the base showed that it didn't have a blade. `
`In fact, it was more conical than blade-shaped. `
`...He noticed that, rather than a knife, it was more like a short handled spear, something with a shape better suited for thrusting than slicing. `
`Rather than a short spear, you might call it a thick icepick. `
`At any rate, after looking at this scene, no further words were needed to describe what sort of terrible purpose such eerily designed weapons were originally made for, `
`nor was it necessary to explain how they carried out their function. `
`Natsuhi, hoping to escape the repulsive steam filling the bathroom as soon as she could, `
`covered her mouth with a handkerchief and dashed from the room... `
`Just viewing their gruesome bodies for an instant had been enough to burn the image into her eyes. `
`If she looked any longer, that image would surely remain in her vision for all eternity... `
`The rising urge to vomit was exactly the same feeling she'd had that morning at the gardening storehouse... `
`For a while, Natsuhi couldn't help but stand with her back facing the guest room, fighting that sickness in her stomach... `
`"......A-At any rate, we can't let the children... `
`we can't let George-kun see this room. `
`Seal this room with all haste...!" `
`"......Y-Yes, we mustn't let them see... `
`If George-san saw his parents in this brutal state..." `
`But they could tell that those fiercely racing footsteps in the hallway belonged to George, even before he came dashing into the room. `
`George and the other children had been waiting in the parlor. `
`However, when they saw Genji speak to Natsuhi, when they saw her turn pale and fly out of the parlor, they'd felt a sense of foreboding. `
`And when they saw a large group of people gathered around the guest room, they were sure of it... `
`"Father!!! `
`Mother!!!" `
`"......Aaahh, `
`wh-what is this...? `
`Another...magic circle?!" `
`"..............." `
`"Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi are safe, right?! `
`Hey, Kanon-kun! `
`What's this all about?!" `
`"...Battler-sama... `
`..............." `
`Kanon didn't have to say anything. George's scream after he ran into the room told them everything they needed to know. `
`"......Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggggh!! `
`Who... `
`who did this?!! `
`I'll kill you, I'll kill you!!!" `
`"...George-kun, `
`......hang in there..." `
`Natsuhi touched George's shoulder with her hand, but he violently shook her off. `
`...George fell over beside Eva and buried his face in the bed in front of his mother's face, wailing. `
`Then he pounded on the bed with his fist, over and over again... `
`".........George... `
`George nii-san, `
`...h-hang in there... `
`......Huh, `
`...Battler?" `
`"......Battler-sama..." `
`Battler......had his back against the wall of the hallway... `
`and was covering his eyes with his right hand and weeping without restraint... `
`"Horrible... `
`.........That's horrible... `
`...He proposed to the girl he loved and lost her the next day. `
`......And on the same day, even his Mom and Dad were killed... `
`......I-Isn't that too harsh...?" `
`...Of course, it's sad whenever anyone dies, no matter who it is. `
`But to Battler, ...those left alone by the deaths of others were far more worthy of pity. `
`Everyone here now had lost someone close to them. `
`George wasn't the only one to be pitied. `
`...However, ...George's pain was far greater than everyone else's. `
`".........Battler......" `
`"I know...everyone dies sooner or later... `
`If you're human, you'll eventually reach a time when you've gotta fight the sorrow of losing someone close to you. `
`...But still, shouldn't that day be far in the future for Aniki, `
`...and shouldn't those deaths visit him one at a time...?!! `
`...Horrible, `
`it's too horrible... `
`...That bastard... `
`That bastard......! `
`Doesn't he have...even a speck of human sympathy in him...?!! `
`Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!" `
`"......Uu-... `
`Battler, ...don't cry, don't cry..." `
`Maria tried to comfort Battler in a mechanical-sounding voice... `
`Battler violently wiped his tears. `
`"Yeah... `
`Damn it, ...I won't cry anymore... `
`Tears of regret, tears of sadness, I won't shed them again... `
`...Aah, it's all useless. `
`The witch's got me backed into a corner. `
`I'm always on the defensive...! `
`And that's useless, it's all useless! `
`I'll spin the chessboard around...!! `
`That bastard probably thinks we'll be running scared like sheep until tomorrow before we try anything. `
`...But guess what, I'll spin it around!! `
`That bastard can't escape this island until tomorrow either...! `
`We won't be hiding away, pissing ourselves, that bastard will! `
`I'll expose you, you'll see. `
`By tomorrow, `
`...no, screw tomorrow. Tonight." `
`"Before tonight's over I'll be gripping you by the collar...!!" `
