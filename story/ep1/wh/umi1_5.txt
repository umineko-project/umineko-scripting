`We crossed the hall again on our way to the entrance. `
`As we did, we once again spotted that witch's portrait. `
`However, 'spotted' is probably not the best word to describe that experience. `
`......It was more like our eyes were inexorably drawn to it. `
`That woman's eyes, with their sage-like glamor, definitely had the power to make those who viewed it stand rooted to the spot. `
`"............So this is the witch, Beatrice. `
`......Wonder if that story's true." `
`"Uu-? `
`Battler doesn't believe...?" `
`Back when he had asked what this picture was, the first person to tell him had been Maria. `
`Therefore, when Battler showed signs of doubt, Maria must have felt that Battler didn't have faith in her. `
`...Of course, that wasn't what Battler meant. `
`Maria ran up to the portrait and began banging on a plate hanging below it. `
`Maybe the title of the portrait was written there. `
`Maria, trying to prove that she wasn't lying, obstinately continued to hit the plate. `
`"Ah, sorry about that, `
`it's not like I doubt anything you said, Maria." `
`"Uu-! `
`Battler believes! `
`Uu-!" `
`When he patted Maria's head and apologized, she seemed to accept it, sticking out her chest and proudly uu-uu-ing. `
`"......What's this? `
`'My Beloved Witch Beatrice'. `
`......'Behold the sweetfish river-', `
`...what's with this weird, huge epitaph?" `
`The plate did have the title of the portrait written on it, but it was much too big to contain only that. `
`Beneath the title was what appeared to be a long epitaph. `
`If you just skimmed over it, several unnerving words would jump out at you. `
`"Incredible, isn't it? `
`Grandfather had that made. `
`...Pretty deep, huh?" `
`"Uu-! `
`I know! `
`It's the place where the gold's hidden!" `
`"...Wait, is it that story about the Ushiromiya family's hidden gold? `
`...Now there's another thing I remember from long ago... `
`...Hold on, Aniki, ...is this for real?" `
`"Grandfather had this made, but he never said anything about this picture or the epitaph. `
`......Even so, amongst the family, it is often whispered that it indicates the location of Grandfather's hidden gold...... `
`and that he will relinquish the inheritance and the gold to the person who solves the riddle." `
`"Uu-! `
`I heard that too, I heard that too! `
`Lots and lots of gold!" `
`"...Well, something like that. `
`Something like 10 metric tons of gold bars. `
`I think it's fake, though." `
`"Still, when you read about it in an epitaph like this, it almost seems real." `
`......I think I already explained Grandfather's upbringing, `
`but let me also mention the Ushiromiya family's 'Legend of the Gold'. `
`Grandfather succeeded the Ushiromiya family after it was destroyed in the Great Kanto Earthquake, `
`and by successfully riding the stormy seas after the war, he managed to accumulate great wealth. `
`...That much of the story everyone knows. `
`However, this is where the strange part begins. `
`...Part of it involves Grandfather's black magic obsession, so its credibility is extremely low, but...... `
`......Well, wait until the end before you doubt or make fun of it. `
`After the war, Grandfather correctly predicted what the future would hold and won in a huge gamble, accumulating a vast store of wealth, `
`......but there's a mysterious legend about how he gained his initial funding. `
`Grandfather came from a branch family and had no connections in the business world or the financial world. `
`Even though he later built connections with the occupying forces, he supposedly started as a nameless person who hadn't yet gained anyone's trust. `
`It takes trust to gather money. `
`There's no way anyone would lend money to someone they didn't trust. `
`......How did Grandfather, who had no reputation at all, manage to obtain his first vast chunk of funds? `
`When asked that question, Grandfather supposedly answered like this... `
`'On a certain day, I encountered the Golden Witch Beatrice.' `
`Grandfather then went on and on about his continuing research into alchemy and techniques for summoning demons in order to become a great magician. `
`...And the entity summoned as the result of the demon-calling ceremony...was the Golden Witch Beatrice. `
`He then apparently made a contract by which he would receive fortune and honor in exchange for his own soul. `
`The witch then granted Grandfather 10 tons of gold. `
`Grandfather used this gold as collateral to prepare a vast quantity of funds, `
`which he then used to multiply his wealth many times over and revive the Ushiromiya family... `
`It seems this story's so old that even our parents were told it when they were still children. `
`So, back when our parents were young, `
`they explored this island in all sorts of ways, believing that the gold Grandfather had received from the witch might be hidden somewhere. `
`However, since there was the danger of them getting lost in the abandoned forest, `
`Grandmother began to spread the story that the witch lived in the forest and approaching it was forbidden. `
`"...I remember that old story. `
`When we were little, we also went all over the island searching for treasure after our parents told us about it. `
`......Didn't we get lost in the forest once, then start crying until some of the servants found us? Our parents got so mad. `
`...Dang, that takes me back." `
`"We sure were idiots, weren't we? `
`After all, Grandfather only bought this island after using those funds to get rich, right? `
`That means he must've had the gold before coming here. `
`There's no way the gold's on this island." `
`"That's not necessarily so. `
`Maybe the gold was hidden on the island from the beginning...and he bought the whole island just to ensure that it'd be his and his alone. `
`There was a whole 10 metric tons of it, right? `
`It seems more realistic that he'd try to secure the place where it was hidden, rather than try to move it all." `
`"This epitaph was made two years ago. `
`And since Grandfather wrote it himself... `
`...yeah, it does make the Legend of the Gold seem more believable. `
`The so-called witch's gold that revived the Ushiromiya family weighed 10 tons. `
`......Maybe that's sleeping somewhere, ready to be turned over to whoever can solve Grandfather's riddle. Maybe that's why he did it. `
`......Haa, I guess that sounds like Grandfather's style or something...... `
`Ihihi! `
`If it's true, that's pretty incredible." `
`The epitaph carved into the plate was very mysterious, with something like a poem or a song written on it. `
`That text was incredibly disturbing, filled with the signs of Grandfather's black magic hobby, and its contents were in truly bad taste, `
`but it could definitely be viewed as a puzzle which, if solved, might lead to the hidden gold. `
`"Whether that's what he intended or not, I can't even imagine what his true motive might've been. `
`......All we know for sure is that Grandfather put this shady epitaph here so that everyone in the family could see it. `
`We also know that he's hinted at the existence of the gold without ever talking about where it might be hidden, at least so far. `
`......These facts then were embellished by the imaginations of our parents, who were convinced that Grandfather was challenging us to a battle of wits..." `
`"...Sounds just like my dad, so greedy that he'd take something like this so seriously. `
`He may laugh at Grandfather's black magic obsession, but he'd still believe this story about the hidden gold. `
`It just sounds so good." `
`"......Well, it's certainly not a realistic story. `
`At that time, when Grandfather was still nameless and had no connections, there was no way anyone would just lend him a massive quantity of gold bars for free. `
`......If such a person actually did exist, it's not unthinkable that Grandfather would call such a sponsor a witch." `
`"Yeah, but it's 10 tons. 10 tons! `
`If you cashed that in, how much would it come to? `
`I mean, it'd have to be a ridiculous amount, right?!" `
`"......It certainly would be a ridiculous amount. `
`They say that the total amount of gold mined by humankind since the dawn of history is 100,000 metric tons, at most. `
`That 1/10,000 of all of the gold humankind has obtained throughout history should belong to just one person is just insane. `
`...On top of that, this 'witch' supposedly had all that gold collected in one place and was able to lend it to Grandfather just like that. `
`We're not talking about any ordinary person." `
`"Well, to me, that '10 tons' number seems pretty fishy. `
`After all, no one's actually seen it except Grandfather, right? `
`Even if we assume that some generous witch existed and lent him some gold, maybe it was closer to 10 kilograms than 10 tons. `
`Even 10 kilograms would be a pretty incredible sum, right?" `
`"Uu-. `
`...10 kilograms of gold is how much?" `
`Maria, who wasn't following the story and felt like she was being spoken to in riddles, finally found a place where she could ask us a question. `
`It was a question I also wanted answered right then. `
`Whether it was 10 kilograms or 10 tons, it still felt like a huge amount, but I had no idea exactly how huge. `
`George-aniki folded his arms and tried to remember the market price of gold. `
`"......Well, `
`even the value of gold is affected by the market, and the value of physical gold can change depending on its purity and the trustworthiness of the foundry. `
`You'd also need to pay handling fees to cash it in. `
`However, that doesn't change the fact that it's a precious metal, and some people estimate that humanity will mine all the world's gold within half a century if gold mining continues at its current rate. `
`............Just guessing haphazardly, `
`......I think you could expect a price of about 2 million yen per kilogram." `
`"Whoa...! `
`......Just now, I randomly said 10 kilograms since it sounded smaller, `
`...but even that would be worth 20 million yen, wouldn't it?!" `
`"Uu-? `
`I weigh 28 kilograms." `
`".........Which means that if we had Maria-chan's weight in gold, `
`we could estimate its worth at over 50 million yen." `
`"That's just unbelievable... `
`How much would 10 tons be then? `
`10 kilograms is 20,000,000 yen, which you multiply by 1000, so......umm. `
`.........Huh?! `
`20 billion yen?! `
`What the hell!" `
`How much is 20 billion yen actually worth? `
`......We can only measure it relative to our own pocketbooks. `
`Anyway, let's say that a person's wages over a lifetime are about 200 million yen. `
`...You grow up and work like crazy, sacrificing your life for your company, and you're finally freed as you approach old age. `
`Everything including retirement money might add up to about 200 million yen. `
`...In other words, that's the amount of money that'll be made throughout a human's life. `
`No, you could even call it the value of a life. `
`...So 100 times that sum is an unbelievable amount of money. `
`......If you work from age 20 to age 60, that's 40 years of work, `
`......so it's equal to 4000 years of work wages. `
`If you worked every day starting from the Jomon period, you'd only reach that number about now. `
`"...Uu-. `
`Is 20 billion yen a lot...?" `
`"Heck yeah, it's a lot. `
`Maria, you love shortcake, right? You could buy more shortcake than you could possibly eat for the rest of your life." `
`"......However, while that might be possible with 20 billion yen in cash, `
`I don't think it would be very realistic to have that much in gold bars all in one place. `
`Just as I said, gold is extremely heavy, so it isn't exactly convenient as a method of storing wealth. `
`Sure, you could imagine someone gathering their fortune together as incredibly high-value stocks or precious gems. `
`...You often hear of people who traded their wealth for precious gems so that they could carry it around with them during the chaotic times of the war. `
`......But you don't usually hear stories of people exchanging their wealth for gold." `
`"It may be heavy, but it's the most trusted and stable form of wealth internationally, so maybe that was important? `
`For example, bonds are just scraps of paper if the whole country goes under." `
`"You can also look at it that way, `
`...but even one 10 kilogram ingot is pretty heavy to carry around. `
`Haven't you heard? `
`A 50 kilogram person can't carry a 50 kilogram bag over their shoulder. `
`With that many gold bars, the amount of labor and risk for one person would be hard to calculate." `
`"So what you're saying is, while it'd be one thing if you had a stack of banknotes worth 20 billion yen, `
`20 billion yen in gold would be such a big mountain that practically it'd be kinda pointless." `
`"That's right. `
`...Although the Legend of the Gold does have a pretty interesting ring to it, just the part about the 10 tons of gold makes it pretty much impossible..." `
`"If you think about it logically like that, it sounds obviously fake. `
`Haha, kind of brings you back down to reality." `
`"Anyway, that's Grandfather for you. `
`Maybe he exaggerated the story of how some kind, wealthy person gave him a loan by saying he got 10 tons of gold from a witch. `
`Even the number '10 tons' feels pretty symbolic." `
`"You mean like his gratitude for the money he borrowed was worth 10 tons of gold, or something?" `
`"Hehehe, maybe some rich man's leisured wife generously granted it to Grandfather. `
`And maybe he started calling this person a witch." `
`I see. Jessica's example isn't bad. `
`...Someone who'd generously lend a huge sum of money to Grandfather when he still had no reputation `
`might as well be called a witch. `
`......Furthermore, Grandfather actually did use that money to build a vast amount of wealth later on. `
`...The fact that this person was so great at judging people `
`might also justify calling her a witch. `
`Also, since she went to the trouble of lending all that money, `
`she might've enthusiastically overseen how it was spent. `
`The decision to unexpectedly get involved with the occupying forces and profit from the Korean War Demands might've been inspired by the witch herself. `
`That might explain why he claimed to have received both wealth and honor from her. `
`"I see. `
`......So, in other words, this witch lent Grandfather the funds necessary to revive the Ushiromiya family, and he owed her big time. `
`...And then, he felt so grateful that he had that huge painting drawn and displayed... Yeah, it's not that crazy a story." `
`"It's even possible this person was an old granny who looked like a witch. `
`Maybe Grandfather idolized her, and that's why he had her drawn to look so beautiful. `
`Hahahahaha, I'll bet if we ever did meet this person, she wouldn't be nearly this pretty!" `
`"Hahahaha, that's possible. `
`The name Beatrice sounds pretty Western, and if you think about how everyone in our family has Western names, `
`maybe even the name Beatrice is the result of Grandfather trying to rearrange some Japanese person's name to make it sound Western." `
`"I get it, I get it. `
`That means this pretty girl doesn't exist outside the picture. `
`Guess that means I won't be able to rub those elegant breasts, ihihi! `
`In the first place, isn't having a witch pretty bizarre by itself? `
`Like you could find something like that anywhere on Earth." `
`I laughed and made fun of the witch, trying to distinguish myself from the kid I was six years ago, who feared the witch of the forest, ...when Maria tugged on my sleeve. `
`...I could tell by how hard she pulled that she was a bit upset. `
`"Hmm? `
`What is it, Maria?" `
`"Uu-! `
`Uu-!! `
`Beatrice eeexiiists!" `
`Maria stared up at me. `
`She had on her usual sour look, but I could tell she was angry by the color of her eyes. `
`"Witches exist! `
`Witches exist! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!!!" `
`"Well sure, they do exist...if you turn the TV on and watch anime or something." `
`"Exist!! `
`Witches exist!! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!!!" `
`I started getting impatient, not knowing why Maria was jumping on me like this. `
`Then, Jessica tapped me on the shoulder and whispered. `
`"Dumbass, you're smashing a kid's dream. `
`Maria really believes things like witches and Beatrice exist." `
`"Come to think of it, Maria-chan, in social studies at your school, when you were asked to write what you wanted to be when you grew up, you wrote 'a witch', didn't you?" `
`Maria nodded seriously. `
`Tears started to run from the corners of her eyes. `
`.........I see. To a girl who wants to become a witch in the future, `
`the existence of Beatrice was proof that witches do exist in this world, `
`and was therefore an image that she yearned after and admired. `
`Exist! `
`Exist! `
`Witches exist!! `
`But Battler still doesn't believe! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!!!" `
`"It's okay, witches do exist. `
`I believe it." `
`George-aniki kneeled down and hugged Maria's head. `
`...Watching this, Jessica poked my side. `
`...So that's what it is. `
`It's like shouting that Santa Claus doesn't exist `
`in front of a child who believes in him on Christmas Eve. `
`...I'm not the kind of guy who likes to shatter kids' dreams. `
`"......Oh, I'm sorry. `
`I wasn't trying to make fun of your dreams, so I apologize. `
`Beatrice does exist. `
`Even now, she's living in the forest and comes to the mansion every night to peek in and see what everyone's doing. `
`......So you shouldn't go into the forest. `
`At night, you mustn't stare into the dark forest. `
`You might be seen by the witch of the forest, Beatrice. `
`.........After all, Grandmother said so." `
`"Uu-...... `
`Really? `
`Battler really believes?" `
`"Yep, I believe. `
`Sorry for doubting it. `
`...C'mon, let's make up." `
`I stuck out my hand, Maria grabbed it with her tiny hand, and we made up. `
`Maria didn't grumble any more than that, so George-aniki and Jessica were relieved. `
`"...Oh. `
`So this is where all of you were. `
`I was sure you had just left to go to the beach." `
`Shannon-chan, carrying a basket, was surprised to find us all gathered in front of the portrait. `
`"Ah, Shannon. `
`Well, this is the first time Battler has seen Beatrice's portrait. `
`He was just fascinated by it." `
`"That's right, it certainly is fascinating. `
`...Beatrice-sama is truly beautiful. `
`I am sure that she captivated the Master." `
`"Ahahahaha. `
`In addition to the patron theory, there's also a theory that she was Grandfather's first love. `
`...Either way, although it's been several decades since he met her, even now she holds a special place in his heart. `
`...Which must mean that he's still captivated by her." `
`"Sheesh. `
`That must've made Grandmother pretty jealous, huh?" `
`"I'm not really sure, but that might actually be true. `
`Apparently, Grandmother believed he was cheating on her with some blonde." `
`"......Uu-? `
`Good smell! `
`Good smell coming from Shannon!" `
`Maria, sniffing, approached the basket Shannon-chan was holding with interest. `
`After hearing that, I noticed a fragrant scent with a touch of vanilla. `
`"Ah, I apologize. `
`I was told by Kumasawa-san to bring them to everyone." `
`"What is it, I wonder? `
`......Ooh, excellent! `
`Cookies." `
`"Uu-! `
`Wanna eat cookies! `
`Wanna eat cookies! `
`Uu-!" `
`"Please, eat as much as you would like. `
`...But, umm..." `
`Would it be appropriate to serve cookies in a place like this, in front of the portrait? `
`Shannon-chan sent us a glance that seemed to ask what we wanted to do about it. `
`...Well, yeah, guess eating here would be bad manners, generally speaking. `
`"Maria, why don't we eat someplace else? `
`Let's put the cookies in a bento and have a picnic." `
`"Uu-! `
`Have a picnic, have a picnic!! `
`If we can eat cookies, let's go!" `
`"Yeah, let's go get some fresh air. `
`We shouldn't stuff ourselves right in front of the witch." `
`"That's right, didn't we say that we wanted to go down to the beach in the first place? `
`Let's go, let's go." `
`"Shannon-chan, `
`sorry, but could I ask you to get us a blanket to sit on and some flasks of tea?" `
`"Right...! `
`Certainly." `
`Shannon-chan received her instructions and gracefully bowed before retracing her steps. `
`We headed for the beach on our own. `
`Everyone headed for the entrance in a group. `
`...Feeling as though that witch was staring down at our backs, I turned around once more. `
`"...Uu-. `
`...Battler, you still don't believe...?" `
`"Nope, I believe. `
`...It'd be so much cooler that way! `
`The Golden Witch Beatrice gave Grandfather 10 tons of gold! `
`And that gold might be sleeping around here somewhere. `
`Besides, didn't Grandfather write that strange epitaph as though challenging us to find it if we can? `
`I'd say that kind of adventurous story's way better." `
`"20 billion yen worth of gold, huh?! `
`Heheh, even if we split it up between the four of us, that's still a ridiculous amount of money!" `
`"5 billion yen for each of us... `
`...Incredible! `
`With that kind of money, you could probably make any sort of business prosper. `
`In fact, we could live our whole lives fabulously without working at all." `
`"Uu-uu-! `
`I don't want 5 billion yen, I want cookies, cookies!!" `
`"Wahahaha, Maria would take cookies over money. `
`Still, 5 billion yen, that's like a dream!" `
`"Ridiculous. `
`......Is it possible that you all truly believe in Father's Legend of the Gold?" `
`".........Of course we don't believe that story about a witch giving him gold, `
`but there's no mistake about the gold itself." `
`"The fact that Father obtained gold bars from an unknown source has been confirmed in several ways. `
`We've heard that, before the president of the Marusoo company died, Father showed him a large pile of gold somewhere. `
`Father used that man's claim as proof that there were 10 tons' worth." `
`"That's just the nonsense of a senile old man. `
`Along with Father, he was just fabricating a story. `
`You can't take it seriously." `
`"If that gold didn't exist, he wouldn't have been able to gather so much funding...! `
`Before the president died, he was a person with such a sincere personality that he earned the respect of many in the business world. `
`He wouldn't have become a partner to such fraud...!" `
`"Aniki, `
`the president of Marusoo definitely saw it. `
`10 tons of it, clearly with his own eyes. `
`Even more, Dad let the president take one ingot at random and have it examined. `
`The results of the examination showed that the 10 kilogram ingot was 99.99 percent pure. `
`He said that the Ushiromiya family crest, the One-Winged Eagle, was imprinted on it." `
`"Almost instantly, the Ushiromiya Legend of the Gold spread amongst the fixers of the business world. `
`Gold from an unknown foundry has a poor rate of conversion into money. `
`Thinking that it was a chance for decisive profits, they accepted it as collateral, and as a result, Father was able to receive massive loans..." `
`"Is there no limit to the absurdity you're willing to accept? `
`...How old are you people? `
`Are you still taking that nursery tale you heard as children seriously? `
`Where is the proof that this 10 tons of gold even exists? `
`Aren't you just parroting the lies of Father and few of those close to him?" `
`"......Of course it's just a story. `
`But still, Aniki, `
`the amount of money Dad raised required a suitable amount of collateral. `
`Even if the gold itself was just a rumor, it's an undoubtable fact that he showed them a treasure of comparable worth." `
`"It was just an illusion of money created by our penniless father. `
`He acted as though he actually had gold that didn't exist, fooling his sponsors. `
`It was probably the gamble of a lifetime. `
`...Luckily, his use of those funds proved successful. `
`If the Korean War Demands hadn't come and the Ushiromiya family had not been restored, Father would probably have been hounded after as the crook of the century." `
`"So, are you saying the gold never existed, and Father made it all up?" `
`"Of course. `
`And because of that, the illusion of gold became a mere inconvenience once he'd achieved enough success. `
`That's why, later on, Father added all that about a witch and black magic, weakening the credibility of the entire story. `
`In other words, he revealed that the illusion of the gold was a fabrication. `
`If he claimed to have received the gold from a witch, no one would believe that it existed at all, right?" `
`"It's also possible he said it for all of your sakes. `
`Nevertheless, here come some stupid offspring wanting to divide up this nonexistent gold, along with the rest of the inheritance. `
`...Rosa, don't tell me that even you believe in a fabrication like this..." `
`".........I can't prove whether or not Father really had the gold. `
`...I just want to claim my rightful share, as one of Father's four children." `
`"Hoh... `
`It seems even you have started to talk that way, Rosa. `
`I see, so that's what you're all getting at. `
`You're trying to claim that I'm attempting to keep all the gold for myself..." `
`"Nii-san, you've gathered a massive supply of funds. That's a fact. `
`If we rule out the possibility that you've been embezzling Father's personal funds, `
`...then there's only one possibility left, right?" `
`"...Aniki, we've been thinking... `
`that you might've found those 10 tons of gold bars." `
`"Ridiculous. `
`Such a thing never existed in the first place." `
`"Then explain yourself. `
`Was it embezzlement of Father's assets or Father's hidden gold? `
`How could you have gathered so much funding if not by one of these methods?" `
`"Even I have many friends in the political and financial realms. `
`I have earned their cooperation, nothing more. `
`......And on that matter, I have no responsibility to explain myself to you. `
`You understand, don't you? `
`There are some topics that ought not be spoken of." `
`"......If you insist on that point, that's all well and good for now. `
`But Aniki, Dad doesn't have long. `
`Nobody can ensure that he'll live to see this day next year. `
`The inheritance process will begin at the instant of Dad's death. `
`We'll arrange for lawyers and accountants who are impartial to all of us and have them inspect Dad's financial situation." `
`"At that time, if it comes to light that you've unjustly interfered with Father's money, `
`......you understand, right?" `
`"I don't have a clue what you're talking about. `
`You're starting to make me feel as indignant as my wife was." `
`"...Of course, Father's gold is part of Father's fortune! `
`We understand it's money you can't reveal openly, `
`but the four siblings should have an equal right to it." `
`"In other words, we're gonna have your financial situation investigated as well as Dad's, `
`to determine whether you're hoarding the gold or not." `
`"Isn't this a great opportunity? `
`Right now, prove the existence of your so-called support from friends and acquaintances. `
`That way we can sportingly apologize for foolishly doubting you. `
`Right, Rosa?" `
`"......That's right. `
`Krauss nii-san, you are the one who's dodging the issue. `
`If you were guiltless, you could just prove that you were in the right, but you aren't even trying to do so." `
`"However, Aniki, we still have to consider your position here. `
`As Dad's representative, you're probably bearing a larger share of the burden than we are. `
`We've been living terribly relaxed lives until now, so it wouldn't be fair for the rest of us to complain without taking your efforts into account." `
`".........Hoh. `
`It seems you cannot make up your mind whether to flatter me or slander me. `
`Please get to the point." `
`"Basically, ......randomly investigatin' nit-picky aspects of Father's wealth seems like a pretty crude way to go about it. `
`As you said, Krauss nii-san, there may've been movements of money that are difficult to explain. `
`We've come to consult with you today while fully aware of that point. `
`...Both sides stand to gain from talkin' 'bout this now." `
`"A consultation? `
`Hoh." `
`"......When the inheritance is divided, you'll be rewarded for your years of hard work taking care of Dad by an agreement that's generous in your favor." `
`"Don't misunderstand us, Nii-san. `
`We aren't saying that we'll abandon our rights. `
`But when we make our claim for what we deserve, `
`we might as well offer a generous understanding for your position. That's what we mean." `
`"In other words, if you accept our conditions, `
`then when the inheritance is divided, we'll leave the investigation of Father's financial situation to you, Krauss nii-san." `
`All of the siblings from Eva downward suspected that Krauss was trying to steal their father's wealth. `
`So, letting Krauss report the state of that wealth was extremely contradictory and a huge concession. `
`If, as they claimed, Krauss was actually embezzling money, Krauss would be able to hide that fact. `
`Besides which, it'd be possible for him to control the distribution of the inheritance in a manner favorable to himself. `
`Krauss, realizing that this sounded too good to be true, couldn't help but feel suspicious... `
`He couldn't help but worry about what they'd ask for in exchange... `
`"...Hoh. `
`After mistrusting me completely, you now say that you're willing to restore your confidence in me as the eldest sibling? `
`So, what is it you want in return?" `
`"Just what we deserve as siblings. `
`......You aren't the kind of person who'd steal Dad's property, `
`but you also aren't being financed by some patron. `
`...Considering all that, there is a certain explanation that'd satisfy the rest of us." `
`"......Nii-san, you found 10 tons of gold `
`and used that as collateral to gather some funding. `
`...Yes, just like Father did in the past, right?" `
`"If that's the case, there won't be any funny business in Father's finances. `
`You've always been a good son, lookin' after Father. `
`Why'd we mistrust a person like that?" `
`".........You're being so roundabout, I can barely understand you. `
`Please speak in clearer and more practical terms." `
`"Our first condition: `
`Aniki, you must admit that you've found Dad's gold." `
`"...Are you asking me to admit I possess gold that doesn't exist?" `
`"Our second condition: `
`You'll acknowledge that each sibling has a right to a share of the gold, and you will pay out those shares." `
`"How foolish. `
`With that nonexistent 20 billion yen of gold, that would be 5 billion yen per person. Are you telling me to pay a total of 15 billion yen? `
`......Ridiculous!" `
`"Keep listenin' 'til the end! `
`We know that much money can't just pop up out of nowhere. `
`We're not asking you to make an impossible deal! `
`Of course, regardin' the portions of the gold, we plan to reward you plenty for your hard work until now." `
`"Our third condition: `
`The portion of the gold to the one bearing the title of successor to the Ushiromiya Head Family will be 50%. The remainder will be considered the fair share for the siblings and divided up. `
`Of course, this also includes you, Krauss nii-san." `
`"Of the 20 billion, 12.5 billion will go to Aniki, `
`2.5 billion will go to Eva nee-san, `
`2.5 billion will go to me, `
`and 2.5 will go to Rosa." `
`".........That division scheme makes me so grateful I could cry. `
`So you're saying, for the sake of the gold that doesn't exist, I must pay you 7.5 billion yen." `
`"What's wrong? `
`Nii-san, your share is five times the size of ours. `
`These are such good terms, I'd be jumping for joy. `
`Heheheheheheh..." `
`"Our fourth condition: `
`The gold will be liquidated and distributed along with the inheritance at the time of Father's death. `
`However, as a deposit, 10% of our portions are to be paid to us promptly. `
`These payments must be made before March of next year." `
`"......What do you think, Krauss nii-san? This is an ideal chance for you to restore the trust regarding your handling of Father's assets, isn't it?! `
`Of course, it might be impossible to get a whole 7.5 billion before Father dies, `
`but it should be possible for you to manage a deposit of 750 million, right?" `
`"Paying 700 million in half a year might sound like a pain, `
`but you should be able to manage it, what with all your friends in the political and business spheres." `
`"Normally, we'd hope to receive the 7.5 billion right now, all at once. `
`But out of concern for you, we'll show our sincerity by asking for only ten percent of that for the time being. `
`The remaining 90% can wait until the inheritance is distributed. `
`...See? `
`Even you'd be capable of managing a mere 10% to show your sincerity." `
`"............So, you're trying to sell me the right to assess Father's financial situation for 750 million yen? `
`.........Heh, heheheh. `
`How impressive. `
`You all certainly have grown. `
`To think that I'm now the one being offered deals." `
`"Nii-san, if you accept these terms, the rest of us siblings will leave the investigation of Father's assets to you. `
`However, the results of that investigation will be subject to scrutiny. `
`...It's only natural, right? `
`We'd be so sad if you managed things so that our 7.5 billion share shrank." `
`"We'll avoid complaining, as a general rule. `
`Just make sure you do it neat and tidy. `
`...As long as you don't try anything that's blatantly obvious, we've got no intention of stirring things up. `
`We want our inheritance quickly too. `
`We don't want it to get all drawn out and left hanging." `
`"......If a complaint is made, who would carry out the follow-up investigation?" `
`"............We don't mind if it's you. `
`This is probably the first and last chance for us siblings to reach a consensus. `
`...I believe it won't come to that." `
`"Heheh, *cackle*cackle*! `
`Looks like even you can speak up now and then, Rosa." `
`By this point, it's obvious that Krauss wasn't at all trusted as the oldest sibling, so there's no need to go into detail. `
`The formerly tyrannical oldest brother had always abused his privileges and violated the other siblings' shares. `
`...It was in response to this that the other three, now adults, were finally teaming up and striking back for the first time... `
`"Sorry, but there's more. `
`Our fifth condition: `
`This decision must take precedence over Father's will. `
`.........Later on, we don't want some will to appear and make this decision completely irrelevant." `
`".........I see that you're very cautious. `
`...Then let me ask, if the gold really were found, what would you do?" `
`"Since you'll be making payments to us for what the gold's worth, `
`the rest of us `
`'really' `
`don't care if we ever see the gold or not. `
`...You can think of our share as an advance payment." `
`"*giggle* It's good to have dreams, isn't it? `
`You plan to turn this island into a resort, right? `
`You might stumble upon the gold by chance during construction." `
`Eva let out a high-pitched laugh. `
`Krauss watched but didn't even flinch. `
`"......Let me add a seventh condition before I accept. `
`In the situation that any sibling other than myself finds the gold, they will immediately turn it over to me." `
`"Yes, yes. Of course, we'll hold onto it for you. `
`*giggle*!" `
`It was a play on words. `
`Of course the others, who were forcing Krauss to pay money for some nonexistent gold, `
`wouldn't save Krauss his portion if they actually found it. `
`From the beginning, this deal had been nothing more than a threat directed at Krauss. `
`Regardless of the actual facts, it was still extremely likely that Krauss was embezzling his father's assets. `
`When Kinzo faced death at last and had his inheritance distributed, some unpleasant facts would surely come to light. `
`That could easily become fatal to Krauss. `
`The others had spotted this weak point and were threatening their brother under the veil of compromise, trying to wring a huge sum of money out of him. `
`......However, they had forgotten one thing. `
`They'd forgotten that their brother's brain moved so swiftly, at least when it came to cunning and guile, that they'd been forced to band together to combat him. `
`While Eva couldn't stop smiling, sure of her victory, Krauss let out a gloating laugh to show how relaxed he was. `
`"Hahaha. `
`This all makes for such a touching story. `
`...My estrangement from you all has left a deep pain in my heart. `
`If accepting these conditions means we siblings can become friends again, it would please me to no end. `
`I'd be happy to agree to your deal. `
`......Rejoice, Rosa. `
`We have reached an understanding." `
`".................." `
`Rosa's expression dimmed. `
`......It was never a good sign when her brother started talking like this. `
`...Eva also keenly picked up on this. `
`That's why she was unable to wipe away a sense of unease, even though Krauss had obediently accepted the deal. `
`"...My, how obedient of you. `
`It's not like you at all, Nii-san." `
`"What a cruel thing to say. `
`Are you implying I have some ulterior motive? `
`Of course I don't. `
`I'm just the same as all of you." `
`'Just the same as all of you'. `
`He seemed to emphasize just that one part. `
`The color of Rudolf's face darkened. `
`To him, it sounded as though Krauss was saying `
`'I have a plan similar to yours'. `
`So Rudolf panicked. `
`He rushed to bring this nearly resolved discussion to a conclusion. `
`"......Then we're good. `
`...So, Aniki, `
`would you mind signing here? `
`This is a written contract summarizing the discussion we've just been having. `
`There's one for each of us. `
`Everyone will sign for the same contents." `
`Rudolf took four written contracts out of his breast pocket that had the details of their deal written on them. `
`"The seventh condition you proposed will, of course, be added right now. `
`Don't worry about that." `
`"Aniki, need a pen?" `
`Rudolf took a fountain pen out of his breast pocket and offered it to Krauss. `
`Krauss made as if to accept it, but then, with a small laugh, he drew back his hand without taking it and spoke. `
`"............Actually, `
`in order to ensure that this agreement is properly executed, I'd like to propose an amendment on just one point." `
`As soon as Krauss said that single sentence... `
`...All of the siblings felt as though something ominous was creeping up their backs at the same time. `
`"...Th-That won't do. `
`We've already decided, haven't we? `
`Just stay quiet and sign it." `
`"Why are you in such a hurry, Eva? `
`Of course I'll sign. `
`I promise the share of the gold going to all of you will be 7.5 billion yen. `
`I also promise that, when Father's inheritance is distributed, I will cleanly and neatly liquidate it. `
`.........However, there is one point that I simply must insist that you compromise on." `
`".........What are you talking about? `
`What don't you like...?" `
`"The part about promptly paying ten percent of your share, 750 million yen. `
`As you pointed out, my financial situation is far from prosperous. `
`While I can guarantee that I will collect on various future investments, `
`I must admit that I am quite poor at the present moment." `
`"In short, I have absolutely no money that I can move around right now. `
`I am incompetent, and my business sense is dull. `
`Since I am the loser you all claim me to be, I don't have the power to move 750 million yen in just half of a year." `
`"Th-That can't be true. `
`Are you trying to deceive us with such a half-baked trick?" `
`"At the time of the division of the inheritance, I will liquidate everything at once. `
`Remove the condition that I must pay you 10% in advance. `
`...That is the only condition under which I am willing to sign." `
`"......Krauss nii-san, that 10% is nothin' more than a number to measure your sincerity, isn't it? `
`All things being equal, you shouldn't have any room to negotiate at all. `
`" We're doin' you a huge favor by offerin' to let things slide for just ten percent in good faith money. `
`Now that we've explained that, you rejectin' our offer would seriously damage our trustin' relationship, right...?" `
`Hideyoshi had a humble expression on his face and was rubbing his hands together, `
`but his eyes weren't calm at all. `
`......Krauss had already seen through to the shadow in the depths of those eyes. `
`".........Hmph. `
`Why are you all in such a rush? `
`Or could it be that you're afraid of something? `
`.........Rosa, won't you tell me alone? `
`...Secretly, so the rest of the siblings can't hear." `
`"............I-It's not as though I......" `
`"Quit it, Aniki. `
`All we're asking is whether you're gonna sign or not. `
`Just forget about making any strange deals or any other suspicious moves." `
`"......Hoh? `
`You say I have no room to negotiate? `
`...Are you trying to claim that I am in a weak position, which therefore puts us in an unequal relationship?" `
`Shivers began to crawl up Rudolf's back... `
`He began to feel himself getting overwhelmed by the height of his brother's completely insurmountable wall `
`...and the long shadow that had existed since they were children... `
`"Shouldn't deals be made between those on even footings? `
`From my perspective, this deal will help restore the long-lost trust of my younger siblings and deepen the love between us. `
`It's an old problem that's been eating at me, and one I would prefer to resolve as soon as possible. `
`I would be overjoyed if we could resolve it today. `
`.........However, it seems I'm not the only one who'd be quite glad to close this deal quickly. Am I wrong...?" `
`Krauss stared at each of his siblings. `
`...They avoided his gaze with animal-like instinct. `
`Only Hideyoshi was slow in avoiding it. `
`...So he was caught by Krauss's gaze. `
`"Hideyoshi-san, `
`I hear your company has been doing extremely well lately. `
`At a brisk pace, it went public, and both its track record and its stock prices have soared. `
`I am truly jealous." `
`"...W-We aren't here to talk about my husband." `
`"However, it is unfortunate that you have neglected your stockholders. `
`It's even more unfortunate that you were unable to solidify your base when you became stock-listed. `
`...Before you realized it, some bad-natured colleagues of yours had bought up a huge share of your company's stock, right?" `
`".........H- `
`How could you know about that...?" `
`"The same way you knew about me. `
`If it's possible to collect evidence proving that no one would offer a loan to me, then it's possible for me to collect evidence on you. `
`Hahaha, is it really so unexpected as that?" `
`Krauss grinned broadly. `
`...In contrast, Hideyoshi's face was rapidly turning pale...... `
`Hideyoshi's company was a restaurant chain management company that he'd started from nothing. `
`Thanks to Hideyoshi's management efforts, the company had achieved success repeatedly, expanding its range, and a petition to make it a stock-listed company had recently succeeded. `
`The greatest advantage of being in the stock-holding system is that you can sell stock certificates and gain a large amount of financing. `
`That amount tends to be far greater than a business's normal profits. `
`So, this is an extremely effective way to gather massive funds to expand a business even further. `
`However, in exchange for financing the company, the stockholders gain certain rights. `
`They're given rights that allow them to observe and guide the company they've invested in, leading to profits even greater than their original investments. `
`......This right is guaranteed to the stockholders, and they sometimes use it to dismiss ineffectual management. `
`The 'right' allows them to keep an eye on management and prevent the money they've invested in the company from going to waste. `
`However, if they use it forcibly, they can eject the former management and take over the company. `
`...After all, dismissing management and nominating new management are powers held by the general body of all shareholders. `
`That power is determined by the majority decision of the stockholders. `
`And people who hold more stock get to cast more votes. `
`In other words, if some person or group holds a majority of the stock, they can freely chase out the old management and make the president anyone they'd like. `
`If they want, it's also possible for them to make themselves president. `
`Most companies take various defensive measures to stop malicious people from buying up their stock and threatening their position, `
`like ensuring that lots of stock is bought by those close to them, such as company employees. `
`However, Hideyoshi's company had only recently become stock-listed, and he hadn't had time to strengthen those defensive measures. `
`Or...maybe Hideyoshi was so engrossed in the management of his company that he couldn't properly understand the dangers of being stock-listed. `
`It's hard to say whether he should be viewed as a kind-hearted manager immersed in the work of management, or a foolish manager who had his feet swept out from under him... `
`...In other words, there existed some people who wouldn't let him get away with that naivety unscathed. `
`They began repeatedly buying up stock in Hideyoshi's company, rapidly gaining such strength that they couldn't be ignored. `
`They then sent anonymous documents to the shareholders in an attempt to gain control of a majority. `
`The documents read: 'The current management continues to make pointless investments and is ignoring the needs of the stockholders. `
`Let us force the current management to retire, cut the current wasted investments, and let this company be born again as one that gives more back to the stockholders.' `
`It's very difficult to make the actual state of a company's management known. `
`...The fruits of Hideyoshi's sleepless nights and constant concern for his company were cruelly distorted, and he lost the trust of his stockholders. `
`Thanks to these efforts, this group had almost collected a majority of the company's stock. `
`...At that point, even Hideyoshi noticed and started to buy back the stock, but the stockholders realized that the company was undergoing an acquisition maneuver... `
`and each demanded a ridiculous price for the shares that Hideyoshi was trying to buy back. `
`They continually tortured Hideyoshi, who had no leeway in the negotiation of the price. `
`One of the certainties of capitalism is that the price will rise when two parties vie for the same thing. `
`And one of the certainties of democracy is that the majority controls everything. `
`So in the end, whoever manages to buy up the most stock wins. `
`...Put another way, whoever has the most money wins. `
`Unless Hideyoshi could obtain a large sum of money at this critical time, he could easily lose all he had built so far... `
`{a:c: `
`'THEREFORE, `
`MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, `
`HE WANTED A LOT OF MONEY RIGHT NOW...!} `
`He couldn't wait for the division of Kinzo's inheritance, since no one knew when he would die. `
`"And you, Rudolf, have been in quite a lot of trouble lately too, haven't you? `
`You always hear people say it's terrifying overseas, but it seems it really is true. `
`American trials are settled quite emotionally. `
`They never hand down generous judgements to foreigners. `
`......Weren't you advised by your lawyer that making a settlement with the other party would be more economical in the long run?" `
`"............What's this all about...?" `
`"......Well, it's just some trouble from work. `
`No big deal. `
`Nothing you can't settle with money..." `
`Kyrie immediately guessed the meaning behind the subtle expression on Rudolf's face. `
`......Her husband had gotten wrapped up in some kind of trouble without her knowledge...and had been worrying over it alone. `
`"That's right. `
`In this world, anything can be settled with money. `
`After all, it can even buy back the broken bonds between siblings! `
`America is very fussy about the violation of rights. `
`But with money, anything can be settled. `
`Long live capitalism. `
`...Though, rumor has it that the settlement money could be as high as several million dollars." `
`Rudolf had been building a large amount of wealth with a certain type of niche industry. `
`...However, a niche is a niche. `
`It definitely wasn't a business exposed to the light of day. `
`An American corporate giant was trying to accuse Rudolf's company of violating their rights. `
`For various reasons, it was thought that victory for Rudolf in this trial would be extremely unlikely, and he was being forced into an all-out surrender. `
`...But even so, there was a way for this to be resolved with money. `
`If he could just pay that money, it might still be painful, but he'd be able to pick himself back up. `
`...But if he didn't pay, he'd lose everything. `
`{a:c: `
`THEREFORE, `
`MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE,{n} `
`HE WANTED A LOT OF MONEY RIGHT NOW...!} `
`".........Rosa, you're a good and noble little sister. `
`You wouldn't even touch a dangerous money game. `
`...However, your softhearted nature was your ruin, wasn't it...? `
`I wouldn't think one should agree to become a co-signer so lightly." `
`"Nng, `
`...umm, `
`...th-that's none of your business, Krauss nii-san!!" `
`Rosa uncharacteristically laid bare her emotions and yelled. `
`...After all, no one was supposed to know that. `
`As Krauss watched, he let slip a muffled laugh... `
`......Without exception. `
`Every one of them, `
`{a:c: `
`MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE,{n} `
`WANTED A LOT OF MONEY RIGHT NOW...!} `
`In other words, the situation had been reversed. `
`After all, the person the younger siblings were threatening...was the only one who had no urgent need for a large sum of money. `
`The other three, however, wanted a lot of money quickly, no matter the cost. `
`In other words, the longer it took to establish this deal, the better position Krauss would be in. `
`Krauss was extremely sly. `
`He had known of their Achilles heel from the beginning. `
`Even so, he had not been certain. `
`Therefore, he had hidden his knowledge until the very end, striking back only after analyzing their attitudes. `
`"If it were possible, I would like nothing more than to raise some money for my adorable siblings in their time of need. `
`...But unfortunately, I have nothing on hand. `
`......If you know of any sponsors that might be able to raise a whole 750 million, I suggest you try there first." `
`Krauss's elated words were so obviously detached from what he actually felt. `
`The other siblings could do nothing more than listen, grinding their teeth. `
`.........If they could think of a sponsor that convenient, they wouldn't have kept up this charade. `
`They had entered this huge battle specifically because they had exhausted all other options. `
`"...However, if you do insist on relying on your big brother, `
`I wouldn't mind using my influence to help you find such a sponsor. `
`.........Oh wait, I do believe you said that I have no influence. `
`Well then, I'm afraid I won't be much help to you. `
`......Hehheheheheheheh!" `
`Krauss's low, gloating laugh began to fill the parlor. `
`The younger siblings, who had been driving the oldest brother into a corner until a moment ago, could do nothing more than grimace and grind their teeth... `
`"......E-Eva..." `
`"......Don't make me laugh... `
`As if I'd ever put myself in your debt...! `
`Don't make me laugh, `
`...don't make me laugh......!" `
`"......I- `
`If we relied on you, how exactly would you help us...?" `
`"I told you, didn't I? `
`All I can do is find other sponsors for you. `
`Of course, I will negotiate for the highest interest rate possible. `
`Hehheheheh, gahahahahahahahaha!!" `
`"......Damn you, `
`...taking advantage of us......" `
`"......Honey, `
`please calm down." `
`"I am calm. I'm extremely cool... `
`......You bastard...!" `
`Kyrie grabbed her husband's hand. `
`But that action made him feel even more pitiful, so Rudolf shook it off. `
`...Krauss laughed as though watching something highly amusing. `
`"In times like these, it certainly would be nice to find Father's hidden gold. `
`If you did, you could split it up into 2.5 billion yen portions right now. `
`How sad, how sad. How very sad! `
`How extremely, totally, truly, hopelessly sad!" `
`"......Tonight, let us all drink together... `
`as we solve the riddle of Beatrice's epitaph and discover the location of Father's hidden gold. `
`If we four friendly siblings work together, there is surely no puzzle we can't solve. `
`...Hahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!" `
`"............Hmph. `
`Quite an entertaining scheme. `
`Well then, what are the conditions they've attached?" `
`"...Well, `
`whether or not Krauss-sama actually discovers the gold, he'll pay Eva-sama, Rudolf-sama and Rosa-sama a total of 7.5 billion yen for their shares. `
`However, 10% of that will be paid before March." `
`"Heh, hahahahahahah... `
`Krauss, you dunce. `
`To think he would have his feet swept out from under him by his younger siblings... `
`How truly amusing. `
`......But it sounds as though they tripped when going in for the kill, yes?" `
`".........Yes. `
`Krauss-sama exposed the fact that Eva-sama and the younger siblings all have an urgent need to get money." `
`"Hmph. `
`Is there even any need to 'expose' such obvious facts? `
`That irresolute, incompetent man. `
`.........What are they doing now?" `
`"......That conversation has been put on hold for the time being. `
`Now, Beatrice-sama's epitaph is being discussed." `
`"So, they're trying to solve the riddle and find out where my gold is hidden?" `
`"............Yes." `
`Kinzo set down his spectacles and snorted. `
`".........Will the miracle be fulfilled first, `
`or will those fools expose the gold first? `
`...What a show this will be. `
`...At the very moment those fools solve my puzzle, I will suffer utter defeat. `
`They can suck my corpse down to the last fragment of bone. `
`The greed of fools can allow great magic to bring forth a miracle. `
`...And yet!! `
`If the fulfillment of the miracle comes first... `
`if it comes first! `
`Beatrice will be resurrected again!! `
`The smile I have been chasing half my life will be restored...!" `
`"Oooooohhh, Beatrice!! `
`Soon will come the sacred night when we shall bet upon a miracle, and the game of demons shall begin...! `
`I will surely prove triumphant and survive!! `
`I'll let you have the lives of all those others! `
`I don't need wealth or honor or assets or gold or anything! `
`All I want is to see your smile one last time!! `
`*coughcoughcough*!!" `
`Kinzo choked, apparently in great pain. `
`Kanon got closer and tried to pat his master's back, but Kinzo motioned for him to stop. `
`".........Do you know why I went to the trouble of exposing the hidden location of the gold in a place that everyone can see?" `
`"......No." `
`"It is because magical power is determined by risk. `
`If the number of people who try to discover Beatrice's gold is great... `
`and the danger of them succeeding is great as well, then the power of magic will bring about a grand miracle if we succeed despite the odds. `
`...In other words, magic is a game. `
`It is not the case that the one who performs the best becomes the victor. `
`The victor performs the best because he has been granted magic. `
`Do you see? `
`It is similar to how the miracle of life can be granted only after winning against the divine odds of several hundred million to one. `
`......Is this a little difficult for you?" `
`"......My apologies." `
`"That's fine. `
`...It all comes down to this. `
`I will give all that I have built up to the one who solves the mystery of Beatrice's epitaph. `
`Wealth, honor, gold, and the inheritance of the Ushiromiya family. Everything that I have established! `
`My children certainly aren't the only ones with the right to attempt to solve this riddle. `
`Anyone who solves the riddle will have the right to gain everything, even you." `
`".........Yes. `
`However, `
`......I couldn't possibly understand such a difficult riddle." `
`"Of course. `
`I made it difficult. `
`...But you must try to solve it as well. `
`That will form the seed that summons the miracle of my magic. `
`If everyone attempts it and everyone fails, that will be that. `
`However, if the miracles come together and give birth to magical power, it will happen! `
`Beatrice will revive. `
`That is why you must attempt it too. `
`Everyone must attempt it. `
`And in so doing, they will give strength to my magic!! `
`Do you understand?!" `
`"............Yes. `
`...I will try." `
`For a long while, Kinzo repeatedly muttered to himself, agitated and clutching at his head. `
`Kanon stayed where he was, alert and unmoving, until he was given the next order from his master. `
`...Kinzo eventually realized this. `
`"Very well, leave me. `
`......There is a bag of sweets on the liquor cabinet. `
`You can take some with you as a reward." `
`"......I'm fine. `
`After all, `
`......I am furniture." `
`"......Hmmm. `
`...So furniture doesn't eat sweets? `
`...Well, I suppose it stands to reason. `
`In that case, leave me." `
`"Yes. `
`...Excuse me." `
`Kanon bowed and left the study. `
`As the door closed, a heavy locking noise sounded out. `
`But it was not the sound of Kanon locking the door. `
`It was the door locking automatically. `
`No one could enter without Kinzo's permission, and once they left, they could not enter again. `
`......It was a mechanism that Kinzo, unable to trust his blood relatives, had created to seal himself up in his own study and isolate himself from the outside world. `
`He was already unable to trust anyone excepting, not the children who shared his blood, but those servants who called themselves furniture... `
`"......Nanjo-sama, how are you feeling?" `
`"...Ah, Genji-san. `
`Oh, it's just that there's no place for me to be anymore." `
`With a bitter laugh, Nanjo turned to face the door to the parlor. `
`...That look was apparently enough to tell Genji what Nanjo wanted to say. `
`For the most part, Genji also understood the family's situation. `
`...It must have made him want to frown, knowing that right now in the lounge, the master he served was being discussed so disrespectfully. `
`But it would have been very difficult to gather that from his indifferent expression. `
`"......Still, `
`...I don't understand. `
`...Why did Kinzo-san have something so provocative written, I wonder." `
`Nanjo looked at the portrait of Beatrice. `
`...No, he actually directed his gaze beneath the portrait, at the plate with the epitaph. `
`"......I do not presume to understand the Master's thoughts. `
`However, I'm sure he had a deep reason for doing so." `
`"Since long ago, when Kinzo-san played chess, he would always prepare his moves according to some far-reaching judgement. `
`Yes, sometimes even to make moves I couldn't understand. `
`......For an average person like me, it was impossible to see through to whatever it was he was planning..." `
`"Sometimes I wonder if this might be some kind of will, in the Master's eyes. `
`......Perhaps he wishes to hand over his wealth and title to the one who can understand it." `
`"...So, you're thinking he may have wanted the four siblings to work together and solve the riddle... `
`before some outsider like myself solved it? `
`Kinzo-san may speak of his children in insulting terms, `
`but perhaps he also wants them to repair their relationship." `
`"..............." `
`It certainly would be heartwarming if, as Nanjo had suggested, this epitaph had been made to repair the siblings' relationship. `
`...However, both Nanjo and Genji knew that nothing could be more impossible than this. `
`They'd known Kinzo longer than anyone, and Kinzo trusted them more than his own relatives, `
`but even they could not guess at his true motives... `
`"......The Master always says that everyone has the right to try and solve the riddle, even if they aren't a member of his family. `
`......What about you, Doctor Nanjo?" `
`"No, no...... It's a little too difficult a puzzle for this senile old man. `
`......Actually, I once wrote this epitaph down on my notebook. `
`Night after night, I would try to solve it before going to sleep, `
`......but, hahaha, it really is hard. `
`It looks like we might have some free time to relax and consider it before someone comes to get us. `
`What do you say, Genji-san?" `
`".........I am nothing more than furniture in service to the Master. `
`Gold and assets are unnecessary to me." `
`"My, you're very modest. `
`...I imagine that's why Kinzo-san trusts you so much." `
`"If so, I am honored..." `
`As Nanjo lightly laughed in response, he once again looked at the epitaph. `
`"......Behold the sweetfish river running through my beloved hometown. `
`You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key..." `
`The epitaph on the portrait called My Beloved Witch Beatrice goes as follows: `
`{e:070:Behold the sweetfish river running through my beloved hometown. `
`{n}You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key. `
`{n}{n}As you travel down it, you will see a village. `
`{n}In that village, look for the shore the two will tell you of. `
`{n}There sleeps the key to the Golden Land. `
`{n}{n}The one who obtains the key must then travel to the Golden Land in accordance with these rules.} `
`{e:070:On the first twilight, offer the six chosen by the key as sacrifices. `
`{n}On the second twilight, those who remain shall tear apart the two who are close. `
`{n}On the third twilight, those who remain shall praise my noble name. `
`{n}On the fourth twilight, gouge the head and kill. `
`{n}On the fifth twilight, gouge the chest and kill. `
`{n}On the sixth twilight, gouge the stomach and kill. `
`{n}On the seventh twilight, gouge the knee and kill. `
`{n}On the eighth twilight, gouge the leg and kill. `
`{n}On the ninth twilight, the witch shall revive, and none shall be left alive. `
`{n}On the tenth twilight, at journey's end, you shall attain to the power of the Golden Land's treasures, once and for the last time.} `
`{e:070:The witch shall praise the wise and bestow four treasures. `
`{n}{n}One shall be all the gold from the Golden Land. `
`{n}One shall be the resurrection of all the dead souls. `
`{n}One shall be the resurrection of the love that was lost. `
`{n}One shall be to put the witch to sleep for all time. `
`{n}{n}Sleep peacefully, my beloved witch, Beatrice.} `
