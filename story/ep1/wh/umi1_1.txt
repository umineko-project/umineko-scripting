`".........Should've taken the boat... `
`......the boat......" `
`"Faaalll! `
`Faaalll! `
`Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!" `
`"Maria, that's enough! `
`......But what a surprise. `
`I thought there was nothing that could scare Battler-kun." `
`"This guy can't handle vehicles for some reason. `
`Always yells about falling and sinking and stuff. `
`You're a disgrace of a man, you are." `
`"......Ah, shut up. `
`That thing was seriously shaking way too much... `
`I just got a little stressed, since it was my first time on a small plane like that..." `
`"You call that 'a little stressed'? `
`Heheheh, sounds like it'd be fun to take an overseas vacation with you, Battler-kun. `
`Would you like to go to Egypt with your aunt? `
`You'd get to ride a plane for a full 14 hours." `
`"Ahhahaha! `
`There's a good plan. `
`Battler-kun, you should go let Eva nee-san toughen you up some. `
`Still, it's so hilarious! `
`Ahhahahaha!" `
`"Wahhahaha, now, now. Everyone's got their own strong and weak points. `
`It's bad to laugh at 'em. `
`Wahhahaha...!" `
`"D-Dad, you're laughing too. `
`Hey, Maria-chan, you shouldn't laugh anymore." `
`"Shouldn't laugh anymore? `
`Uu-!" `
`Gyah, dammit! `
`Is being scared of planes really such a big deal? `
`Everyone obviously thinks I'm a big oaf now... `
`Tch! `
`We split up and took separate taxis from the airport to the harbor. `
`From there on, we would be taking a boat to the island. `
`The islands are right next to each other, so the distance of the trip wasn't that great. `
`By boat, it was a leisurely 30 minutes to the island. `
`When we reached the pier where the boat to the island was anchored, we saw a figure waving at us. `
`"George nii-saaan! `
`It's been so frickin' long!!" `
`"Ah, Jessica-chan, it's been a year since I saw you! `
`You've gotten taller again, haven't you?" `
`"Kyah-haha, don't gimme that, it's embarrassing when you say it every year!" `
`"......H-Hey, Aniki, you've gotta be kidding me. `
`Is that really Jessica?!" `
`"Wait a sec, George... `
`Is this big guy... `
`Battler?!" `
`We both stared at each other. `
`...She definitely didn't look like that in my memories, but I do remember her {c:86EF9C:crazy way of talking}. `
`"Yo, Jessica! `
`What's this now?! `
`You're kidding me, you look like a woman now! `
`What're these, boobs? Even you managed to get a chest! `
`Ihihi, let me rub 'em, let me-!" `
`"Don't screw around with me, I'm a blushing flower of 18! `
`Of course my hair grew longer and I got these! `
`What, you think I got boobs just to get fondled by you, loser?! `
`And speaking of you, sure, you got all ridiculously huge, `
`but did ya get a bit stronger too?!" `
`"Don't screw with me, I'll show you how much training I've done since back then!!" `
`"You're pissing me off!! `
`I'll beat you at your own game!" `
`This headstrong girl's name is {p:0:朱志香}. `
`......She was born under the same unlucky star as me, sharing the same kind of weird name. `
`Anyway, {p:0:朱志香} is pronounced 'Jessica'. `
`She's Dad's older brother's daughter. `
`That older brother happens to be the oldest son of the Ushiromiya family, so for now, it means Jessica is the direct family heir. `
`Since Jessica and I are the same age and sometimes had little boy-girl squabbles with each other, `
`we've always been used to fighting and joking around together whenever the relatives gather. `
`Jessica grew more quickly, so she always had me beat in terms of size and physical strength. `
`When we scuffled in a contest of strength, it usually went Jessica's way. `
`So even though I realized I'd grown bigger, part of my mind was still convinced that I couldn't beat Jessica. `
`"Hnng! Ghhh......!!" `
`".........Woh...ah...! `
`What the...what're you getting all serious for...?! `
`Owowow..." `
`"Hey, this is nothing! `
`Jessica, you've gotten weak." `
`"Sh-Shut up. `
`I'm a girl, `
`so of course I couldn't beat a guy with physical strength forever, right?!" `
`"Weeelll, you've got a point there! `
`The meat I put on my arms all went to your chest. `
`It looks like it'd be a pretty even test of strength between my arms and your boobs, don't you think?!" `
`"I told you, my boobs aren't for you to feel up!! `
`Besides, how 'bout you? Did your cute lil' elephant-san get a bit bigger to go with the rest of you?!" `
`"Stop it, idiot! Nooo, you perv! I'll be ruined for marriage... Don't touch my cro-tch!!" `
`"D-Don't say stuff people are gonna misinterpret!!" `
`Honestly, I was so surprised at how feminine Jessica had become that I had to joke around like an idiot to hide it. `
`......Well, considering what a bossy brat she was six years ago, anyone would be surprised. `
`And I guess she's just as surprised. `
`She probably wasn't expecting to lose to me in a test of strength. `
`After losing that easily, she must be shocked at how much I've grown in the past six years. `
`......Six years. `
`Once again, I'm being shown just what a huge gap of time that was. `
`"Crap, ...total defeat. `
`It's like I'm no match for you anymore." `
`"That's not true. `
`Even Battler-kun must have his weaknesses. `
`Right, Maria-chan?" `
`"Uu-! `
`Faaall, faaall!!" `
`"Shh, cut it out, Maria, let's keep that a secret, okay?" `
`"Faaall? `
`The hell are you talking about?" `
`"Heheh! `
`Sorry, but there's no chance you'll see that weakness of mine now! `
`After all, the nightmare plane trip is already over and done with! `
`Only thing left is the nice, quiet splashing of the boat ride. `
`I never thought I'd start loving that piece-a-junk boat this much. `
`Ihihi!" `
`"Huh???? `
`George nii-san, is there something wrong with his head?" `
`"You'll understand soon. `
`Very soon." `
`At the time, I didn't get what Aniki meant by that big smile... `
`"What have we here...oooh! `
`Battler-san, how big you've grown...!" `
`Who's it this time? `
`It's an old lady with an apron. `
`.........O-Oh yeah, that takes me back... I remember now! `
`"You remember her, right? `
`It's Kumasawa-san, the servant." `
`"I could never forget you, Kumasawa baa-chan! `
`After all, you haven't aged a bit in these past six years. `
`If anything, I'd say you're looking younger than ever." `
`"Hohohoh! `
`Lately, my skin's been getting quite smooth and silky! `
`And look, hasn't my chest gotten bigger as well? `
`...How'd you like a little feel?" `
`"Y-You're kidding, right?! `
`My breast fondling is strictly limited to bouncy girls!" `
`"Oh, I was quite bouncy in my youth. `
`Don't be shy, fondle to your heart's content!" `
`"Gyah, gimme a break! `
`It's girls I'm looking for! `
`Not grannies!" `
`The jokes I'd cracked about Jessica were being turned against me. `
`Come to think of it, Kumasawa has always been the type to tease people. `
`"Kumasawa-san, stop that now. `
`People with one foot in the coffin shouldn't jump around." `
`"To sport with the young is the most rejuvenating medicine. `
`Hohohoh!" `
`"It's rare for you to come pick us up, Kumasawa-san. `
`I wonder what's gotten into you. `
`Usually, your lumbago kicks in whenever someone gives you a job to do. `
`*giggle*." `
`"Hohohoh, Eva-sama, you're as harsh as ever. `
`I found myself with some urgent purchases to make, and while I was at it, I thought I would come welcome you all. `
`Although, it does give a bad impression if the one waiting to greet you is a decrepit old woman. `
`Hohohoh...!" `
`Aunt Eva spoke sarcastically, but Kumasawa baa-chan's years of experience were nothing to sneeze at. `
`She was more than capable of smoothly and coolly deflecting that comment. `
`Well, it feels bad to say it, but old Kumasawa baa-chan may be past her prime as a servant. `
`She might act as though she's in good health, but between the headaches and her lumbago, her body is wearing out. `
`To tell the truth, the very fact that she's still working is impressive. `
`...How old is she this year again? `
`She must be pushing eighty at least. `
`It's incredible that she's still able to act so cheerily. `
`"You just seem to get more and more lively. `
`Oh, that's right, here you are. `
`It's the tea I told you about before. `
`Look, I bought you some. `
`Please do try it later on." `
`Aunt Rosa took a souvenir bag out from her suitcase. `
`To think that she remembered a promise that she'd apparently made last year and faithfully bought it. `
`...This sort of thoughtfulness was just like Aunt Rosa. `
`She wasn't the kind of person who would forget or break a promise. `
`Kumasawa baa-chan seemed deeply touched, not only that Aunt Rosa had remembered this year-old promise, but that she would bring a gift to a simple servant like her. `
`This woman is Kumasawa Chiyo-san ({p:0:熊沢 チヨ}). `
`She's a senior servant who's been working at the Ushiromiya Head Family household for many years. `
`As you'd expect from someone her age, manual labor isn't her strong point, but she's a kind of super servant who can handle just about anything else, from kitchen work to cleaning and laundry. `
`It seems like her only flaw is a tendency to slack off. `
`I hear she tries to get away from heavy or troublesome work by playing up her chronic diseases. `
`......In Kumasawa baa-chan's case, this was probably a sign of craftiness rather than laziness. `
`...Though it probably doesn't impress those paying her salary. `
`Ah well, even if she's pretty flaky when it comes to work, I could never dislike her. `
`I guess that's probably because of her cheerfulness and her constant smile. `
`"Hey, glad to see you're still in fine spirits! `
`How's your back doin' then?" `
`"Even with the medicine, it's not getting one whit better. `
`According to the doctor, nothing can be done for this one. `
`It's what you might call an incurable disease, hohohoh!" `
`"Anyway, Jessica-chan just keeps getting prettier. `
`Good thing she takes after Natsuhi nee-san." `
`"R-Really...? `
`Personally, I don't think we look alike at all... `
`I mean, I don't even wanna be like my parents. `
`'Cause I got zero respect for 'em." `
`"Now, you shouldn't say such things. `
`*giggle* Though there are quite a few people who don't want to be like their parents in our family." `
`"Ah, that's me!" `
`"You sure as hell better not take after me. `
`Your nose looking like mine already pisses me off." `
`"What are you talking about? `
`You're surprisingly alike, you and Father." `
`"Come on, you can't be serious... `
`Just how am I like Dad?" `
`"You're a lot like him, especially in how arrogant and prideful you are. `
`Father's blood is especially strong in you and Nii-san. `
`Wouldn't you say, Rosa?" `
`"Oh, absolutely. `
`Krauss nii-san and Rudolf nii-san are almost unbelievably like Dad." `
`"All right, all right already, why am I the only one under fire from the girls? `
`Hideyoshi nii-san, gimme a hand, please." `
`"My my, Rudolf-kun, you're always so popular with the ladies. `
`I'm jealous! `
`Wahahahaha!" `
`"Hohohoh! `
`As usual, you're popular enough to make me jealous. `
`Well then, everyone, shall we head over to the boat? `
`Come now, Maria-san, let's get on the boat together, okay?" `
`"Get on the boat together. `
`Uu-! `
`Everyone gets on together. `
`Uu-!" `
`"Hell yeah, this time around I'm not gonna be scared. `
`I'm used to being shaken by the waves. `
`With that piece-a-junk fishing boat, I'm less afraid of the shaking than the engine breaking down and the boat drifting off." `
`"Oh yes, Battler-kun, I forgot to tell you. `
`...That fishing boat was completely worn out, so it was taken out of commission a few years back. `
`Now we get taken to the island in a different boat." `
`"Ohhh, right. `
`It's Battler's first time in the new boat! `
`It's super comfy! `
`And frickin' fast! `
`It can go at crazy high speeds!" `
`"Ohhh... `
`That means less travel time, right? `
`That sounds great! `
`Having to worry about sinking is less scary than being on a plane, but it'd still be awesome to get it over with as quick as possible!" `
`"...Uu-. `
`Is Battler going to go 'faaall, faaall' again?" `
`"That's only on airplanes. `
`Everything's fine now!" `
`"Anyway, it's the captain's pride and joy, a kind of modded high-speed boat. `
`Seems he's got it pretty souped up. `
`He was bragging about how he attached four-base high efficiency propellers to make it break 40 knots, or something like that. `
`He talks about it all the time, so I've sorta memorized the spiel." `
`"Yeah, I've got it memorized too, since we hear about it every year. `
`The captain says he's been obsessed with modding ever since he lost a speed contest with a foreign boat ages ago. `
`According to him, that opponent managed to break 30 knots with just a fishing boat." `
`"And his thirst for a revenge match got him to build an awesome, all-new, super high-speed modded boat. `
`I'm sure you'll just love it, Battler." `
`...S-Super high-speed modded boat...? `
`...My first thought was that this would be much better than some beat-up boat that might sink at any moment...... `
`...but for some reason, I got this feeling of foreboding... `
`......Probably just overthinking it. `
`"Hey, Battler, maybe you should just swim to the island." `
`"Battler-kun, you shouldn't lean over the railing too much. `
`You might fall." `
`"Uu-uu-!! `
`Faaall, faaall!!" `
`"Daaaaammiiiiit, ...so this is why you were all grinning back there!" `
`So this is the super high-speed boat that the captain started modding... Oh, yes, that piece of junk fishing boat from six years ago doesn't hold a candle to this guy. `
`"Whooooooooa, it's shaking it's shaking it's shaking!! `
`Gonna fall fall faaall!!" `
`"Uu-uu-uu-!! `
`Gonna fall fall faaall!!" `
`"If I fall, I'll land in the ocean and drown...! Where's the parachute...?! I mean, where's the buoy?! `
`Gimme a life jackeeeet!!" `
`"Waah-hah-hah-hah-ha! `
`Battler, what the heck're you doing that for, waah-hah-hah-hah-ha!" `
`"Jessica-chan, Maria-chan, it's not nice to tease. `
`Battler-kun, if you're scared, then just don't come out on the deck. `
`I think you'll be able to calm down a bit if you go inside the boat." `
`"Heheh, that's a no thank you, Aniki! `
`Shipwreck victims are always the ones inside the boat. `
`The survivors are usually those on the deck during the accident. `
`So I'm staying right here!! `
`But it's shaking!! `
`I'm gonna faaall!! `
`Whooooaaaaaahhh!!" `
`"Shake, gonna faaall!! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!!" `
`"Maria, I told you to behave yourself! `
`......But Battler-kun, it looks like you really can't handle it... `
`I'll go tell the captain to slow down for you." `
`"Whooooa, Aunt Rosa, thank yooooouuuuu! `
`I can tell you now that safe, slow driving is definitely the way to go, even on the seaaaaa!!" `
`"Heheheh! `
`Don't do that, Rosa. `
`Trials and tribulations are important for young men. `
`Isn't that right, Battler-kun? `
`You'd better be able to overcome a little scare like this. `
`Otherwise, you'll never be able to go to Egypt with your aunt!" `
`"Whooooa, Aunt Eva, you're so meeeeeeeeaaaan! `
`Ooh noooo, I'm gonna faaaaaall!! `
`Life jackeeeet, parachuuuute!! `
`Whoooooooaaaaaaahh......!!! `
`W-Wait, gotta spin it around and think that way!! `
`What's the enemy aiming for?! `
`Is he doing this to scare me?! `
`If that's what he's aiming for, too bad, like hell I'll be scaaaaaaaared!! `
`But noooooo, I'm gonna faaaaaaall!!!" `
`...So, after I made a huge fool of myself for a while, `
`Aunt Rosa had a talk with the boat captain, and he slowed down to a more manageable speed for me... `
`".........Haa... `
`That's a bit better... `
`...Thought I was gonna die earlier..." `
`Apparently, the max speed I can tolerate is extremely slow. `
`...But that just now was completely insane... `
`The whole boat was shaking! `
`Sliding and leaping on the ocean's surface! `
`It felt like I was riding on the back of a flying fish... `
`Jessica was still guffawing at me as I leaned against the railing, tired and disheartened. `
`"I lost in that strength contest earlier, but I'm glad to know I'm no worse off where it really counts. `
`But seriously, hahahahahah!" `
`"Dammit, ...go ahead and laugh. `
`One of these days, I'm gonna find your weakness and get back at you...and then your boobs will be mine to squish......" `
`"Ahahaha! Yeah, sure, good luck with that! `
`Waah-hah-hah-ha!" `
`"Uu-. `
`Battler, all weak." `
`"Yeah, Battler, all weak... `
`I wanna die on land, not in the ocean or the sky..." `
`Maria was patting my back, so I patted her head in return. `
`...Her expression was blank, as usual, but I realized that she wanted to console me. `
`"Battler-kun, the captain's throwing in drinks to make up for this. `
`Would you like one `
`to calm yourself down?" `
`George-aniki and Kumasawa baa-chan brought us all ice-cold cans of soft drinks covered with beads of water. `
`Judging from Kumasawa-san's big grin, our parents inside the boat were probably all rolling around laughing at my moment of pure terror. `
`Dammit, I'm so embarrassed, I can't bear to face any of them... `
`If I didn't change the subject somehow, I had the feeling I'd be the butt of everyone's jokes for the whole trip, so I tried to think of something harmless to talk about. `
`"...Hey, Jessica. `
`How are Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi doing?" `
`"My old man and Mom? `
`Unfortunately, they're fine. `
`Though every other word out of their mouths is 'study, study', which pisses me off. `
`I'm so jealous, since it doesn't look like Uncle Hideyoshi or Uncle Rudolf would say stuff like that." `
`"Hahaha, oh no. `
`Before I had my exams, my parents kept pressing me about it over and over. `
`I thought it was annoying then, but now I'm grateful." `
`"Hah, I knew it. You really are awesome, Aniki... `
`Anyway, I have to look after myself. `
`No one tells me what to do! `
`Well, it's not like I'd listen if they did, hihihi!" `
`"Battler-san, have you still not returned to your parents' home?" `
`"...Well, I kinda go back now and then. `
`I've got lots of clothes and stuff left at the house I was living in until recently." `
`"......Uu-? `
`Battler has two houses?" `
`"Uh, `
`.........hmmm. `
`......Something like that." `
`"Why? `
`Why do you have two houses? `
`Uu-? `
`Uu-?" `
`Only Maria, who couldn't really grasp the situation, voiced this naive question. `
`However, the others just shot nervous glances at me, choosing not to respond even though they knew the answer. `
`"Maria! `
`Look, you can see the harbor now...! `
`Look, over there! `
`Can you see it?!" `
`"Uu-! `
`Saw the harbor, saw the harbor!" `
`Apparently, Jessica was trying to be nice by changing the subject. `
`......Ah, well. `
`I'd rather not talk about it if I can help it, but it's uncomfortable to have it treated like some kind of weird taboo. `
`......I don't mind it that much myself anymore. `
`I may be a member of the Ushiromiya family, `
`but the truth is that, for these last six years, I've been living with my grandparents on my late mother's side, and I've even been using her family name. `
`When those grandparents passed away one after the other, I basically had no choice but to go back and live with the old bastard. `
`Don't get me wrong. `
`I didn't just run away from home or anything like that. `
`The only one at fault here is my dad. `
`......I don't really blame Kyrie-san. `
`Being able to hold that old bastard's reins and ride him out is no mean feat. ...Still, the way that old bastard betrayed my mom... `
`......Well, unfortunately, I still haven't fully gotten over that. `
`"*Ahem*. `
`We'll be getting there soon." `
`George-aniki cleared his throat, trying to change the subject. `
`"......Please forgive my indiscretion. `
`It seems this old woman has said too much already. `
`If I have hurt your feelings-" `
`"Heheh! `
`I don't mind it, and no one's feelings are hurt. `
`Don't worry, Kumasawa baa-chan." `
`Kumasawa-san seemed to regret speaking out of turn, `
`but I was more concerned about being worried over for something like that, so I stood up and passed it off lightly. `
`After that, I had a sip of my drink and headed over to Maria and Jessica, who were gazing at the silhouette of the island. `
`"Uu-! `
`Battler, I saw the island, saw the island! `
`There, there, there! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!" `
`"Where is it...oh, I see it now. `
`Even after six years, the island hasn't changed a bit." `
`The small island's silhouette in front of us had gotten pretty close. `
`This island's name is Rokkenjima. `
`It's a small island about 10km around, located in the Izu Archipelago. `
`Since they call this archipelago 'the Izu Seven', lots of people think there are only seven islands, but that's not true. `
`There's actually several more, `
`and Rokkenjima is one of the minor islands that don't get counted. `
`Even if that weren't the case, I doubt you'd find many people who knew about this island. `
`Only people connected to the Ushiromiya family ever go there. `
`In other words, outsiders and tourists never have any reason to care about it. `
`So, you'll never find this island's name in a travel brochure. `
`After all, all of Rokkenjima is an estate possessed by the Ushiromiya Head Family. `
`Only the Ushiromiya family lives there, and only people connected to the Ushiromiya family come and go to and from there. `
`There's nothing there except a harbor and a mansion. `
`The vast majority of the island is still just uncultivated forest. `
`Such a waste, when it could be made into a nice golf course or something. `
`However, when you realize that the entire coastline is a private beach, it starts to sound pretty magnificent. `
`You've probably guessed by now, but to put it simply... `
`...well, the Ushiromiya family is just rolling in dough. `
`The Head Family apparently possesses a vast fortune, `
`and Dad and the others who make up the branch families have built up plenty of wealth for themselves, finding success in their respective businesses. `
`I've been living a commoner's life at my grandparents' home these six years, so I'd completely forgotten, `
`...but the old bastard's house really is elegant, and everything about it is tuned to match the snobbish tastes of the annoyingly rich. `
`Come to think of it, I guess that makes George-aniki, Jessica, Maria, and me wealthy, high-class gentlemen and ladies. `
`Needless to say, none of us think of ourselves that way at all. `
`I don't see myself as being rich, and George-aniki, who takes self-discipline very seriously, doesn't let himself get too comfortable. `
`Jessica is always complaining that she'd rather move to the city than be rich, `
`and Maria is still a kid who isn't even interested in money at all. `
`...Does that attitude really make us any less snobbish? `
`From the perspective of people in poverty who can't pay the bills, we really have been blessed with a lot. `
`This isn't the place to explain any further, so I won't. `
`Anyway, it's the same as not being able to choose the parents you're born from. `
`I didn't ask to be born into a rich family. `
`And I don't think it's really something to be envied. `
`It can be pretty trying when people are prejudiced against you just because you're rich and refuse to judge you by your merits... `
`As I pondered these sentimental thoughts, Maria started shouting and leaned over the railing. `
`"............Uu-. `
`......Gone." `
`"What's wrong, Maria? `
`Did you drop something?" `
`"Uu-uu-! `
`Gone, gone! `
`Uu-uu-uu-uu-!!" `
`Maria kept yelling 'gone, gone'. `
`At first, it sounded as though she had dropped something, but while she shouted, she also pointed out over the ocean. `
`"What's wrong? `
`What's gone? `
`I'll look for it too, if you want. `
`What is it? `
`............?" `
`If she'd dropped something, she would probably have looked down at the floor, but Maria was pointing out over the ocean. `
`One would assume by that gesture that she had spotted something, but she kept saying that something wasn't there... `
`......Strange. `
`However, since my last memories of this place came from six years ago, I was able to spot it before Aniki, who comes here every year. `
`"............Huh...? `
`......If I remember correctly, wasn't there a {c:86EF9C:Torii} or something on top of a small crag around here? `
`...That's right, it was definitely there. `
`I remember it well, since as we get closer to the island, it's the first thing to greet us, like a landmark." `
`"Wow, you're amazing, Battler. `
`Even though it's been six years, you remembered." `
`"It was here, wasn't it...! `
`I remember too. `
`The tutelary god's shrine and that Torii-like thing were standing all alone on that crag. `
`......And now that you mention it, they are gone, aren't they? `
`I'm pretty sure they were still there last year." `
`"Gone. `
`Gone. `
`Uu-uu-uu-!" `
`"Maybe they were washed away by the waves or something. `
`It was a small crag, so it probably got worn away over time." `
`"Well, that's my theory too. `
`It was last summer that it disappeared. `
`But they say-" `
`"They say an enormous lightning bolt came crashing down one evening and smashed the shrine... `
`...The fishermen whisper that having a thunderbolt fall upon our honored tutelary god must be a portent of approaching misfortune. `
`...Kuwabara, kuwabara..." `
`Kumasawa-san smiled impishly as if teasing us, rubbing her hands together while entoning a Japanese phrase meant to ward off lightning. `
`However, Maria apparently took this seriously... `
`and stared fixedly over the ocean to where the crag housing the shrine god was supposed to be. `
`".........A portent...of misfortune. `
`.........Uu-." `
`"Enough, Kumasawa-san. `
`Maria isn't old enough to get that kind of joke." `
`"It's okay, Maria-chan. `
`It's just a coincidence. `
`Nothing scary's gonna happen." `
`George-aniki put a hand on Maria's shoulder to calm her down, but Maria's sharp-eyed expression didn't waver. `
`"............Misfortune. `
`............Misfortune." `
`Maria muttered that word over and over. `
`Apparently, repeating a single word over and over is a habit that Maria's had for a long time. `
`However, since the word she was saying was literally an ill omen, it was a bit creepy. `
`"Hey now, Maria. `
`If you say it over and over like that, misfortune will really end up happening, you know?" `
`I tapped Maria's other shoulder. `
`Maria whipped her head around, stared into my face, and spoke unblinkingly. `
`"Uu-. `
`.........Misfortune...is coming." `
`"Huh? `
`And just where is it coming from?" `
`I answered light-heartedly, trying to break the tension in the air. `
`...At that moment, Maria held up a finger, raised her arm high, ...and pointed up to the heavens. `
`When I looked up, I saw that the sky was still just as cloudy, but it had grown a great deal more leaden than it had been that morning. `
`That's right, they were saying that a typhoon was approaching. `
`...We had planned to spend one night on the island, but if this storm doesn't pass quickly, I won't be able to make it to school on Monday. `
`Well, I guess it makes for a pretty good excuse to be absent. `
`".....................Uu-..." `
`...She apparently sensed some kind of misfortune in this cloudy sky. `
`She's been muttering that non-stop for a while now. `
`Girls at Maria's age tend to be very impressionable. `
`She's just about the age that many girls start to get excited about sixth senses and whether they have any psychic potential and stuff. `
`...For all we know, this might be due to her childish, sensitive nature. `
`"It's okay, Maria-chan. `
`The weather might get worse tonight, but tomorrow it'll clear up and become a pretty blue sky." `
`"Uu-. `
`Pretty blue sky......... `
`.........Uu-..." `
`"That's right, by tomorrow it'll be a pretty blue sky. `
`There's no rain that doesn't end, and no clouds that never clear." `
`"Uu-... `
`.........Rain that doesn't end. `
`...Clouds that never clear. `
`..................Uu-........." `
`"I know the typhoon's coming, but soon it'll go away! `
`It'll be okay, Maria." `
`"...............Uu-. `
`...Uu-!! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!!" `
`Maria started yelling 'uu-uu-'. `
`...It looked as though she was having a tantrum because no one could understand what she was trying to say. `
`What in the world is Maria trying so desperately to warn us about? `
`Unable to understand her, we couldn't help but feel a vague sense of misfortune... `
`......I've heard that everyone can feel the supernatural, but that it weakens as you age. `
`That might mean that Maria, the youngest one of us all, still possessed some kind of sense that the rest of us had lost. `
`...I wonder if that sense is sending her a warning. `
`At that moment, Kumasawa-san quietly opened her mouth. `
`".........Rumor has it... `
`...that long ago, Rokkenjima was-" `
`"Kumasawa-san. `
`Let's not talk about that now." `
`Just as Kumasawa-san was about to tell some kind of story, Jessica sharply interrupted her. `
`Jessica's tone was extremely firm, for her. `
`I wanted to push her further, just out of simple curiosity, `
`but judging by the look on Jessica's face, whatever Kumasawa baa-chan was likely to say would probably make Maria even more uneasy. `
`...If I did try to press her for the story, the odds were pretty good that it wouldn't be anything bright and cheery. `
`"......Hoh hoh hoh, I do apologize about that... `
`...The wind here is hard to bear for the elderly, so if you would excuse me for now..." `
`Gossipers have no reason to hang around after they've been told to stop chatting. `
`When Kumasawa-san finally realized that she'd overstepped her bounds, she went back inside the boat. `
`After she left, Uncle Hideyoshi showed up in her place. `
`Since he'd arrived mid-conversation, he completely failed to notice the complicated atmosphere that hung about the scene, `
`so he refreshingly and unwittingly swept that atmosphere aside. `
`So, in the end, it was his lack of tact that brightened the mood. `
`"Looks like we're almost there! `
`Oookay, just a bit more! `
`Took forever at the speed we went today, didn't it? `
`Wonder whose fault that was! `
`Wahhahahahaha!" `
`"Aww, Uncle Hideyoshi, gimme a break already... Tahaha!" `
`"Ahaha, come on, don't stop there. `
`Seriously, thanks to Battler here, it's takin' forever!" `
`".........Uu-." `
`Maria probably thought that everyone was refusing to listen to her. `
`She hung her head, wearing a fretful expression. `
`As she did, George-aniki crouched down to meet her eyes and spoke to her kindly. `
`"Maria-chan. `
`There's nothing to be afraid of. `
`Because we're all together. `
`There's nothing to be afraid of if we're together. `
`Go ahead and say it." `
`"............Uu-. `
`...There's nothing to be afraid of...if we're together..." `
`"Yes. `
`There's nothing to be afraid of if we're with each other." `
`"............Uu-." `
`"That's right, exactly what George-aniki said. `
`If we stick together, there'll never be anything at all to be afraid of. `
`Right, Jessica?" `
`"Yeah, no doubt about that. `
`What George nii-san says is always true, Maria." `
`"......Uu-. `
`George onii-chan always true." `
`"Yes. `
`I don't lie. `
`So trust me. `
`There's nothing to be afraid of if we're all together." `
`"Uu-. `
`......George onii-chan doesn't lie. `
`I trust you. `
`There's nothing to be afraid of if we're all together. `
`.........Uu-, not afraid!" `
`Maria jumped into George-aniki's arms and hugged him tightly. `
`After Aniki patted her head, she jumped away again. `
`Her facial expression had undergone a 180 degree change, turning back to normal. `
`She was once again the ordinary Maria. `
`"Uu-. `
`There's nothing to be afraid of anymore, because we're together. `
`...Uu-uu-." `
`"Yeah, that's it. `
`...You look all better now. `
`You're strong, and that's awesome!" `
`"......Uu-! `
`{c:86EF9C:I'm} awesome!" `
`"Hey now, what's goin' on here? `
`Maria-chan didn't get seasick, did she? `
`Hmm?" `
`"Hahaha, well, something like that. `
`We'll be arriving soon." `
`The harbor was already drawing near. `
