`Shannon entered the entrance hall to the mansion with a tottering gait. `
`A mixture of exaltation and uncertainty gave her a feeling that she couldn't easily describe. It swelled up in her chest until it felt like she was about to burst. `
`After stopping for a second in front of the servant room to take a deep breath and calm her heart, she opened the door. `
`Inside, Gohda, who had been ordered to take the midnight shift at the mansion tonight, was absorbed in a worn-out crossword puzzle magazine. `
`He looked up for an instant to see if one of the family had come, but when he realized it was a fellow servant, he returned to his puzzle as if nothing had happened. `
`"......Umm, `
`...Genji-sama told me to come and help you." `
`"Ah, is that so...? That's a relief. `
`I was just about to go check that the mansion was fully locked up, but I felt uneasy about leaving this room unmanned. `
`After all, Krauss-sama and the others' meeting looks as though it will continue for quite some time. `
`They might request some tea at any moment." `
`"That's true... `
`Then, what shall we do...? Should I watch over-" `
`"In that case, forgive me, Shannon-san, but I'll ask that you patrol the mansion. `
`I will stay here, awaiting the family's orders." `
`"...Y-Yes..." `
`...Shannon was slightly disgusted. `
`Even though she'd come here to help out as a favor, she was casually being forced to do the job of the person actually on duty. `
`Furthermore, after one-sidedly forcing that task on her, Gohda returned to his magazine once again and became immersed in his crossword puzzle. `
`Shannon bowed her head as a token sign of respect for her elder, then left the room to patrol the mansion. `
`Thanks to her being a bit ticked off, she managed to suppress that floaty feeling she'd been having until just now. `
`And anyway, she couldn't let Genji or Kanon see her looking like this. `
`She wanted a little time to herself until her heart calmed down, so maybe going on patrol wouldn't be so bad... `
`She began to hear the tumultuous voices of the family discussion coming from the dining hall. `
`Someone was speaking at great length, only to be interrupted by someone else. `
`This second person also began to speak in a very long, drawn-out fashion, until yet another person interrupted. `
`That kept on repeating. `
`It was as though their displeasure was seeping out through their voices. `
`She had been told to go to the guesthouse, so it would be bad if Krauss discovered her. `
`Thinking this, Shannon dashed past the dining hall. `
`Then, she went along a prearranged route through the dark mansion, checking that all the locks were secure. `
`She walked down the hall, checking each window. `
`There were no humans on Rokkenjima other than those connected to the family, so locking up didn't really serve much of a purpose. `
`No one had been in the habit of locking up at the Ushiromiya Head Family, at least not until Natsuhi had scolded them for being careless. `
`The metal fixtures on the windows were ice cold, and as she checked them one by one, the glow in her heart seemed to cool down. `
`"..................?" `
`At that time, she thought she saw something twinkling across the hall. `
`......Twinkling? `
`How could anything be twinkling through the darkness of the hall...? `
`She figured she must've been imagining it, but she still held her breath. `
`Grasping a curtain, she fearfully gazed down the hall...... `
`However, other than the occasional crack of thunder brightening the hallway, she was unable to glimpse any flicker again. `
`...It must've been her imagination after all. `
`Maybe her heart was so agitated that she'd seen something that didn't even exist. `
`Shannon went back to checking the windows... `
`However, a certain unnerving memory was resurrected in the back of her mind. `
`...It was that ghost story...which had been passed down amongst the servants who served the Ushiromiya Head Family. `
`The mansion had two different Masters, one of the Day and one of the Night. `
`...Beatrice, the Master of the night, would sometimes fly around the mansion in the form of sparkling butterflies. That was the story. `
`...Come to think of it, didn't Kanon-kun once say he'd seen it with his own eyes......? `
`Though he got sulky when I said he must've imagined it and refused to believe him... `
`......Could it possibly...be true...? `
`The roar of the thunder gave no answer... `
