`"Hey, everyone, good job finishing "Umineko no Naku Koro ni"! `
`Man, I still didn't have a clue what was going on when the story ended!" `
`"So just what happened? `
`Was that basically the 'bad ending', where time runs out before the culprit gets exposed?" `
`"Uu-. `
`Definitely a bad ending. `
`Uu-." `
`"That's right. `
`Beatrice's letter, which Maria-chan read on the first day, did tell us in advance to solve the riddle of the epitaph. `
`We were all so busy trying to protect ourselves and look for the culprit that we didn't even take a shot at it." `
`"...That's right. `
`If we had actually tried to solve the riddle, maybe things would have ended differently." `
`"I wonder about that. `
`Shannon-chan, you did a good job too! `
`You don't have to be our waitress and serve tea. `
`After all, this is a wrap party. `
`As a group of people who met a horrible fate, let's all get along and lick each other's wounds! `
`Licklicklick!!" `
`"Speaking of a horrible fate, Shannon beats the rest of us hands down, doesn't she? `
`She was such a beautiful character, so I thought she'd definitely survive until the very end, `
`but she was killed right in the beginning, and on top of that...what was it? `
`Half of her face was smashed, right? `
`That's the worst!" `
`"...That was my role, so, umm, ...there was no way around it..." `
`"...Nee-san, it's nothing for you to worry about. `
`Judging by the last epilogue, even Milady and the rest of them met an extremely tragic end." `
`"Ahahaha, ...it seems so. `
`I think I remember seeing this horrible picture, kind of like my entire body had been eaten apart and dismembered." `
`"Speaking of which, don't you think Kanon's last moments were the coolest? `
`Even though he had the tables turned on him, it was a showdown with the culprit, right? `
`It's a whole bunch better than our confusing last moments, right?" `
`"...Though, in the end, I was unable to get a solid hit in." `
`"Still, ...I think Kanon-kun's death was a big hint. `
`After all, because of that, the existence of the 19th person was made clear." `
`"That's right. `
`At that time, everyone's location was obvious. `
`So it was impossible for anyone other than some unknown 19th person to kill Kanon." `
`"Uu-! `
`I said it was Beatrice from the beginning, over and over. `
`Uu-!" `
`"...I don't wanna believe it, but that does prove the culprit was a witch calling herself Beatrice." `
`"That's right... `
`There were many strange things that happened...that a human couldn't do..." `
`"Uu-. Only a witch could do things like murdering Aunt Eva in that closed room. `
`A human couldn't do it! `
`Uu-!" `
`"...Not only is the existence of a 19th person clear, but it's also obvious that this person holds a power that humans can't even imagine." `
`"In that case, I don't think there's anything wrong with calling this person Beatrice." `
`"...We probably met at the very end. `
`...Met with the Golden Witch." `
`"Like I kept saying, Beatrice exists. `
`It all went bad because no one ever believed. `
`Uu-! `
`Even one of her witch friends says that miracles won't occur if you don't believe. `
`Uu-!" `
`"That's right. `
`Beatrice-sama is generous to those who respect her." `
`"...It seems to me that Maria-sama was never a target of Beatrice-sama's wrath up to the very end, despite the horrible crimes that occurred one after another." `
`"Well, Maria believed in Beatrice from the very beginning. `
`...But if that's the case, how do you explain why you and the rest were all killed? You guys believed in Beatrice just as much, right?" `
`"...Beatrice-sama probably had her reasons." `
`"If the song of the epitaph represented Beatrice-sama's resurrection ceremony, many sacrifices were needed. `
`...He must simply have been designated to be one of those." `
`"...Shannon-chan, you met a horrible end... `
`At the very least, I wish your death could've been more peaceful and pretty." `
`"...Umm, well, ...it's not like it hurt... `
`Anyway, `
`right now, I'm perfectly fine, so don't worry." `
`After seeing him stroke Shannon's cheek, which had been crushed during the story, everyone laughed out loud, smiling. `
`"Well, it feels a bit weird saying this, ...but I was sure this story would fit into the standard mystery genre. `
`I'm a bit surprised to find out that it's a fantasy. `
`After all, a Western mansion shut away from the outside world on an isolated island, with an inheritance problem on everyone's minds... It sounds just like a typical mystery novel to me." `
`"...Uu-. `
`It's not fantasy! `
`Beatrice 'exists'! `
`Uu-." `
`"...Yes, we understand. `
`Beatrice-sama does 'exist'." `
`"That's right. `
`...Beatrice-sama does 'exist'." `
`"...I hate to admit it, but I've got no choice. `
`Because it's obvious that a 19th person, a witch, was involved...!" `
`"Many things happened that'd be impossible for humans. `
`During the story, we tried to deny that in all sorts of ways. `
`...But now, I can say it for sure. `
`Each crime, every single one, would've been impossible for a human. `
`...They'd be impossible to carry out unless it was the witch Beatrice using all of the power magic could provide." `
`"The culprit was a witch. `
`That point's perfectly clear. `
`Heh, long live Beatrice. `
`Hahahahahaha." `
`"Uu-. `
`Everyone believed. `
`I'm so glad. `
`Uu-!" `
`"...Gods and witches might seem terrifying to people who are frightened of them, `
`but I think they must be affectionate to those who believe in and respect them." `
`"...I think you're right." `
`"So, this murder case game is finally over. `
`Now's the time to pull ourselves together and try hard to solve the riddle of the epitaph, just like Beatrice said, right?" `
`"Uu-! `
`I agree! `
`Beatrice will definitely be happy." `
`"Hahahahaha... `
`Everyone ignored that letter during the story." `
`"...Even though it was thrust right in front of us, we almost completely ignored it. `
`I kind of feel sorry for Beatrice-sama." `
`"I've got the epitaph written down right here! `
`Let's all solve it, let's all solve it...!" `
`"This story probably went wrong ever since that time." `
`"...That may be so. `
`Maybe we should've tried solving the epitaph's riddle from the beginning, like Beatrice said." `
`"Well, it's a little late now. `
`Even so, let's try solving it now and see if the witch forgives us. `
`Let's go, let's try to solve the riddle of the epitaph. `
`...It was something like, 'Behold the sweetfish river running through my beloved hometown.'..." `
`Maria put her notebook on the table and opened to the page where the epitaph was written. `
`Everyone stared at it, getting really into it as they started guessing this and that about the riddle. `
`Surrounded by the smell of black tea and freshly baked vanilla cookies, they spent the time comfortably and happily... `
`"......Hold on a second, you guys." `
`But Battler spoke in a way that cut through the conversation. `
`His expression looked a little unhappy. `
`What could he not like about all of this fun? `
`"...I've been listening to you guys for a while, but... why did you all stop thinking? `
`Why are you so sure that the witch was behind all this? `
`...Don't you realize something like that can't exist?" `
`With just those words, ...the happy atmosphere surrounding the tea party evaporated in an instant. `
`George and Jessica. `
`And Shannon and Kanon. `
`And Maria. `
`...All of them stared blankly, wondering what in the world Battler was talking about. `
`Even the foolish, arrogant Battler realized that he hadn't chosen his words well. `
`"...B-Because, `
`isn't it clear that these crimes were impossible for a human?" `
`"Th-That's right, that's right. `
`...None of the cases would've been possible for a human." `
`"That's true... `
`After all, wasn't it full of things that humans couldn't explain...?" `
`"...I don't understand what you're saying, Battler-sama." `
`"I-I'm the one who doesn't have a clue what you guys are talking about! `
`Isn't it obvious that humans committed these crimes? `
`There's no way something like a witch exists, right...?" `
`"Th-Then, `
`...what about when I was killed in the storehouse, and something horrible was done to half of my face? `
`...If the culprit was human, how could they have accomplished it...?" `
`"...That's... `
`...well, `
`it's hard to imagine how they did something that awful. `
`But that was the rose garden storehouse, right? `
`I'm sure there were plenty of weird tools in there. `
`Let's say they used some electrical tools like a grinder or an electric saw." `
`"......Th- `
`That's... `
`umm..." `
`"Then, Battler, `
`...how do you explain Grandfather's disappearance from the study when it was a closed room...? `
`Even though the door was sealed, Grandfather just suddenly disappeared, right...?" `
`"We talked about that during the story, too. `
`It's not impossible that Grandfather used some trick to fool the receipt. `
`It's also possible that he went out the window, fell down, and Aunt Natsuhi locked the window from the inside. `
`I could think of a bunch of tricks you could use without relying on magic..." `
`"...Th- `
`That makes sense, but..." `
`"In that case, Battler-kun, `
`how do you explain the way my parents were killed in the guest room? `
`The door was sealed by the lock and the chain. `
`Naturally, the window was sealed too. `
`How do you think a human could've killed my parents?" `
`"...Well, `
`...we did have to leave that trick alone during the story. `
`Anyway, there's at least a good chance the culprit had a key. `
`And it was possible to look in through the crack of the door that the chain allowed. `
`...I know this is a stretch, but it's possible some device was used through that crack. `
`...Like maybe they stuck something through it...?" `
`"...Hmmmm, well, even though a door chain is incredibly simple, it's a big factor in setting up a closed room... `
`...Still, there's probably some closed room trick they could've used. `
`If you bought some closed room mystery novels from the bookstore, you could probably find some trick that'd fit perfectly. `
`...Anyway, I can't think of one now, ...but I claim that there's nothing humans can't do if they try hard enough." `
`"Isn't that argument horribly irrational...? `
`It's just ridiculous to claim that it's possible for a human to do something, even though you can't explain how..." `
`"...Why is that ridiculous? `
`Why did all of you stop thinking? `
`Even something that looks impossible has to be doable. `
`Doesn't it always work like that?" `
`"Battler, you're the one being ridiculous. `
`...If you think a human could've done it, try explaining how. `
`You can't, can you?" `
`"And you're okay with saying the culprit is a witch just because I can't explain it? `
`With that argument, all the unsolved crimes in the world could be resolved by saying a witch is the culprit!" `
`"...Battler, you're sidestepping the issue, and you aren't explaining anything. `
`...We're saying 'A human couldn't have done it. `
`Therefore the culprit is something that isn't human. `
`And that something is a witch.' `
`And yet you keep arbitrarily deciding that witches are impossible, even though you can't explain anything." `
`"...Kihihihihihihihihihihihi, it's almost like humanity was during the dark ages. `
`Like those fools who claimed the heavens spun around the earth... `
`those who said that the earth couldn't be spinning, even though they couldn't explain why." `
`"......Th-That kind of argument kinda pisses me off. `
`So this is basically what you're trying to say. `
`...If I can't explain how a human could do it, `
`then I must accept that the culprit is a witch?" `
`"...It's not like we're forcing you to go that far. `
`We were just wondering on what basis you can say such nonsense." `
`"N-Nonsense `
`......? `
`...H-Hey, have I really been saying something that weird just now?! `
`Am I the one who's crazy?! `
`You guys are really starting to freak me out!" `
`"...Battler-sama, `
`when I died in the boiler room, I was killed by a 19th person who shouldn't exist. `
`...Can you explain how a human could have done that? `
`At that time, the locations of the 18 were well known. `
`Even so, I was killed." `
`"We talked about that in the story as well, right...?! `
`Kumasawa baa-chan, for example. `
`She said she followed right after you and headed down to the boiler room, but we can't know for sure whether that was a lie or not. `
`For all we know, she might've entered the boiler room with you and caught you by surprise! `
`Or maybe, when you stepped into the boiler room, you activated some kind of trap, one that might've been set up to hit you with one of those icepicks." `
`"After all, the stink of Grandfather's body was coming from the incinerator. `
`Someone was bound to go and check, so if the culprit just set up a trap beforehand, they could easily have stayed away from that place and used the time of Kanon-kun's death to create an alibi...!" `
`"...You talk about a trap in the boiler room, ...but what kind of trap could that be?" `
`"That's right. `
`Following his death, everyone immediately ran over to the boiler room. `
`But we didn't find any kind of weird device, did we?!" `
`"...That is correct. `
`Battler-sama, what kind of trap could I have been killed with...?" `
`"Well, `
`...I don't know that. `
`...But anyway, they must've used some kind of clever trap, or maybe someone's lying, `
`...or what about this?! `
`Kanon-kun, what if the whole thing was just you playacting?! `
`Th-That's it, you were playacting!! `
`Aunt Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi were also playacting. `
`They made the closed room themselves, and were only pretending to be dead!" `
`".........Battler. `
`.........Has your... head been... `
`umm, `
`...feeling okay...?" `
`"...Umm, ...should I bring some cold drinks...?" `
`"D-Don't look at me with those pitying eyes... I'm not saying something that crazy, right? `
`I'm just pointing out some possibilities you might find if you think of it all as a trick. `
`Look, isn't it a pretty classic trick in mystery stories to have one of the victims just be playing dead?!" `
`"A classic trick...?" `
`"I-In other words, `
`when Kanon-kun was killed, we knew for sure where all the rest of us were. `
`And let's assume that Kumasawa baa-chan wasn't lying. `
`But that's only counting the survivors. `
`...What if the culprit pretended to be dead and joined a group of real victims so we'd lose track of them, and then acted on their own later? Everything would be explained!" `
`"......Huh...? `
`So, are you trying to say that Aunt Eva or one of the others was the culprit...? `
`But didn't Doctor Nanjo confirm all of their deaths, as a doctor?" `
`"...That's right. `
`Doctor Nanjo checked all of the victims. `
`...Battler-sama, for your theory to work, wouldn't Doctor Nanjo have to be one of the culprits too?" `
`"Uh, yeah, that's right!! `
`Once you consider that Doctor Nanjo might've been one of the culprits and faked the proclamation of death, the whole story changes...! `
`See, that's also a classic trick in mystery novels, isn't it?!!" `
`"...But Doctor Nanjo was also killed, right...?" `
`"Umm, ...about that... `
`...That's right, Doctor Nanjo faked his death! `
`After all, there wasn't anyone except Doctor Nanjo who could examine corpses properly, and everyone was really confused then anyway. `
`We didn't have any spare time to check and see if he still had a pulse! `
`With this theory, any one of the dead people could've been walking around!" `
`"...I think it would've been hard for the six of us who died in the beginning to do that... `
`...After all, the shutter was closed, ...and there was a padlock that couldn't have been opened from the inside..." `
`"That's right. `
`Mom was holding onto that key. `
`So was Mom one of the culprits too?" `
`"...Aaaaaaah, wait a sec... `
`Maybe it was impossible for the first six, but in the case of Aniki's parents, the door was only locked on the outside. `
`So they could've opened it from the inside... `
`...That's right, after we left the room, maybe they jumped out the window and got to the boiler room first! `
`...I-Is that too much of a stretch...?! `
`Or maybe Doctor Nanjo made a mistake when examining the corpses?!" `
`"Look, he said it himself, right? `
`He said there's a very high probability of making a mistake when examining corpses! `
`If you disguised it well enough or prepared a substitute body, you could fake your own death!! `
`Let's leave the method or trick they used for later...and you see, it's not that hard to deny a 19th person existed, right?! `
`Much less a witch, right? `
`At least that much is completely impossible!!" `
`"...I don't know why you've been trying so stubbornly to say that one of us is the culprit. `
`Kihihihihihihihihihi. In other words, you want to suspect one of your relatives...?" `
`"That's not it... `
`It's just, uh, I can't easily accept that a 19th person existed...and even if one did, I think we should construct our argument from the point of view that the culprit was a human. `
`I'll only accept that it's a witch in desperation, at the very end, after everything else has been disproved." `
`"There's no way witches exist, right?! `
`Why has everyone been casually accepting that the culprit was a witch? `
`I think it's great how your family love makes you hate the thought that someone close to you is a murderer. `
`But is it okay to let that fool you?! `
`Don't you want to find the detestable culprit who killed so many people?!" `
`"Aniki, don't you want to avenge your parents?! `
`Jessica, don't you want to avenge Kanon-kun, and Kanon-kun, don't you want to avenge Shannon-chan?! `
`Shannon-chan, you should at least want to know who it was that killed you. `
`Why has everyone totally surrendered and decided that the culprit was a witch?! `
`What's wrong with all of you?!" `
`The foolish and short-tempered Battler tried to force his ignorance on the others and yelled at them. `
`...However, everyone just looked at him pityingly, silently watching over him. `
`At that time, the wise Maria laughed and pointed out Battler's mistake. `
`"...Kihihihihihihihihi. `
`...I'm shocked. `
`...All I see is you repeating this nonsense, thinking you've figured something out, Battler. `
`...So? `
`What's next? `
`How would a human do it? `
`In practical terms, I mean? `
`I imagine you'll say 'I just can't think of anything now' or 'with some kind of device.' ...Using abstract words to run away and evade the topic." `
`"...What I really want to know, Battler, is this. `
`Why don't you believe in Beatrice? `
`She exists, so why don't you believe?" `
`"Because she doesn't 'exist'! `
`Witches don't 'exist'!! `
`There's no way!!" `
`...It was almost like a spoiled child who just doesn't want to accept something. `
`The pitying gazes quietly closed in around Battler, but they didn't reach his stubborn heart. `
`"...You realize that you're acting just like a spoiled brat throwing a tantrum, right?" `
`"...Battler-sama, `
`I understand your feelings, but..." `
`"...Beatrice does 'exist'." `
`"Battler-kun, ...why don't you believe? `
`Even though there's so much proof." `
`"I don't accept the argument that the witch must've been behind everything just because I can't explain it. `
`Does this mean that if you don't know how a light bulb shines, then magic is the cause? `
`That's wrong, isn't it?! `
`There's nothing that can't be explained without magic!! `
`All of this about witches and magic is just abdication of thought! `
`You just surrendered and gave up because you don't understand what happened! `
`Isn't that right?!" `
`"......Ki, hihihihihihihihihihihi. `
`Well, `
`...unsurprisingly, it looks like you alone won't believe no matter what, Battler. `
`...If even a single person doesn't believe, the 'miracle' won't occur. `
`...So, if you don't rethink your ignorant theories, the miracle...the magic won't be completed." `
`"Hehe... `
`Now I see. `
`...I finally figured it out. `
`...So, in other words, you guys are trying to force me to say the witch exists, right? `
`A lie that everyone accepts becomes 'the truth'. `
`...Is that what this is all about?! `
`...I'm so sorry. `
`I'm so sorry I keep going on about this, but what you're doing is all useless. I refuse. `
`{i:You guys are all pressing me, and that's why it's all useless}. `
`"......Why?" `
`"Sorry, but why don't you let me spin the chessboard around one last time...? `
`If you want to force me to accept that there's a witch, there's a really easy way. `
`...And it's not the indirect way of saying 'it must be a witch because humans couldn't have done it'! `
`All you have to do is show me a witch doing it with magic." `
`"Furthermore, what Maria said earlier is what'll really dig her grave. `
`...You said that if even one person doesn't believe, a 'miracle' won't occur." `
`"But real miracles happen whether people believe in them or not! `
`Even if I alone don't believe!! `
`So any miracles or magic or witches that exist only because I believe in them are downright lies!!" `
`"........." `
`The uneasy mood following Battler's ignorant rant...... `
`was blown away by a very soft and light laugh. `
`Whose laugh...? `
`Battler was surprised. He had never heard that voice before. `
`When he looked at George and Jessica, at Shannon and Kanon and Maria, he noticed that they had suddenly gone respectfully silent. `
`"......Beatrice." `
`"...How amusing. `
`...I haven't met such a charming human for quite some time." `
`"Wh‐ `
`Who... `
`...are you...?" `
`"......So you don't even know the host of the tea party to which you were invited. `
`...How amusing indeed. `
`*cackle*cackle*...!" `
`"...This is Beatrice-sama, the Golden Witch who has lived for a thousand years." `
`"It is an honor to be graced with your presence, Beatrice-sama..." `
`"...Please forgive Battler-kun's ranting." `
`"Th-This guy's just stubborn, and, umm, he still doesn't understand the situation he's in...!" `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*... `
`What a treat this is. `
`...Most witches get tired of living after the first thousand years. `
`How nice it is to meet a man with backbone such as yourself every once in a while." `
`"...It is quite an honor to be present when Beatrice shows herself, Battler." `
`"...Heh, `
`...heheheheh!! `
`How... `
`...astonishing. `
`...Are you really that desperate to make me believe that a witch... `
`that a 19th person is the culprit...? `
`This is starting to get interesting...! `
`And it's all useless...!! `
`You must be the illusion that Maria and the others call the witch, Beatrice." `
`"...And, you'll only be allowed to exist if everyone believes it. `
`...You have that kind of a half-existence, right? `
`That's why you want to make me believe too. `
`{i:You can't exist because I alone don't believe in you~}. `
`...Isn't that right?!" `
`"...Your powers of comprehension aren't bad for a mere commoner who knows nothing of magic. `
`...Yes, it seems you were born with a strong magic-resisting power. `
`...You're a natural enemy of us witches. `
`...No matter how much we turn your world upside down, `
{i:you never believe in us.} `
`{i:Therefore, the magic won't succeed}. `
`...I accept that attitude of yours. `
`*cackle*cackle*...!" `
`"I've got no clue what you're saying, ihihi! `
`It's very kind of you to go to all of the trouble of showing yourself to us, `
`but I don't believe you exist in the slightest." `
`"It's true that many strange things happened during those two days. `
`Like Maria said earlier, even though I think all the tricks could be explained, I still can't lay out the practical details of each one. `
`However, that doesn't mean I'll surrender." `
`"I'm different from the rest of them, got it? `
`I'll never accept that it was the work of a witch just because I can't explain it." `
`"...This keeps getting more amusing. `
`Making you surrender will be worth my while... `
`...You're just the kind of man I'd like to force into praising my name...... `
`I'd love to try making a man like you kiss my toes. `
`...*cackle*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"If you want to talk nonsense, talk all you want...! `
`I deny you exist. `
`All of the events can be explained with 'human tricks'...!! `
`There's no room for even a speck of magic or witches!!" `
`"Wonderful! `
`...What a perfect way to divert oneself from a thousand years of boredom. `
`Then let me ask you. `
`A short while ago, you said that using the crack in the door would be sufficient to kill Eva and Hideyoshi, right...? `
`Explain how they could have been killed using some human trick." `
`"...Heh. `
`Suddenly jumping right into the toughest part, are you? `
`...Does that mean this is the trick you're proudest of? `
`Miss {i:Real Culprit? `
`With a shake of her golden pipe, `
`gentle, multi-colored smoke trailed out of the end. `
`The smoke quickly obscured their surroundings, `
`...and they were suddenly in the hallway of the mansion. `
`The door in front of them, slightly opened but secured by the chain, was... `
`That's right, it's the door to the room where Eva and Hideyoshi were killed. `
`"...N-Nice trick..." `
`"Very well. `
`Show me what you would do through this small crack, Battler." `
`"Erk, ... `
`...th-they probably had some device to shoot those 'icepicks'. `
`If they used that..." `
`"How would they reach Eva over on the bed when you can't see that far through this crack? `
`...And how would they reach Hideyoshi, in the bathroom with the door shut...?" `
`"......Damn... `
`...There's a crack... `
`There should be some way..." `
`"*cackle*cackle* `
`If you can't think of one, allow me." `
`"...Oh? `
`How would a witch do it...? `
`C'mon, let's see your little trick..." `
`"...Battler, you're being rude to Beatrice..." `
`"How nice, how nice. `
`What a charming man. `
`...That will make it even more fun to force him into submission." `
`"...Heh! `
`You really wanna make me kiss your toes that much...?! `
`Only if I surrender! `
`But watch... I'll definitely expose this trick, and then I'll make you kiss my ass instead!" `
`"...*cackle* `
`What a delightful man. `
`I'll remember that promise. `
`...Weak witches kiss the behinds of demons to gain power. `
`Because there's no more humiliating oath. `
`Just being told that makes me want to force you into surrender. `
`...*cackle*cackle*...!" `
`Paying no mind to Battler's worthless ranting, Beatrice once again shook the golden pipe. `
`...That's right, that golden pipe was her precious magic cane. `
`"Come, arise, children. `
`I am the guide of Purgatory. `
`Forgive the deadly sins and hold the Seven Stakes." `
`Guided by those magic words, which sounded like a command, seven stakes gathered. `
`...They were the stakes of the seven demons symbolizing the deadly sins of sinful people. `
`"Beelzebub and Asmodeus. `
`Come, forgive the sins. `
`Release the spirits of the sinners...!" `
`"Wha...?!" `
`The picks of Beelzebub and Asmodeus responded to Beatrice's call. `
`The two stakes of the demons were sucked in through the crack of the door, like billiard balls struck by a cue stick. `
`Then, several scattered noises refracted through the wall, making a sound like a woodpecker. `
`And at the end, a pleasant sound could be heard. `
`...It was a small, satisfying sound, like the one heard when someone is chopping firewood and the falling ax neatly and easily slices through the wood. `
`It was the sound of the two picks burying themselves deep into Eva's and Hideyoshi's foreheads. `
`"...Right down the middle. `
`Want to see...?" `
`They'd definitely heard two sounds like a pair of foreheads being split open. `
`Battler wasn't permitted to see it, since he was on the other side of the door, `
`but those two had died again, and this second time, they lay not an inch apart from where they had lain the last time, with the exact same blood-spray as before. `
`"...Y-You moron... `
`...Th-That's insane...! `
`Y-You think you can just kill them like that?!!!" `
`"I can kill them. `
`...I can kill them just like this...! `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*!" `
`Suddenly, they were no longer in the hall, but seated at the tea party they had started from. `
`...Everyone but Battler was sitting meekly, ...but Kanon was moaning, fresh blood dangling from his mouth. `
`What a rude thing to do at a tea party. `
`Satan's stake was buried deep into Kanon's chest. `
`"..................u... `
`...gah `
`..." `
`"K-Kanon-kun, `
`...Kanon-kun!! `
`...D-Damn iiiiiiiiiit!!" `
`Battler was the only one getting agitated. `
`George, Jessica, Shannon...everyone else was meekly hanging their heads like students being yelled at by their teacher. `
`"...Kanon was captivated by a trifling anger and tried to disturb my banquet. `
`...Being easily captivated by anger is your deadly sin. `
`Cleanse yourself, repent, and do it over." `
`"......at `
`...rice... `
`...sa...ma..." `
`"B-Beatrice-sama, `
`...please, forgive him... `
`I think Kanon-kun has repented enough...!" `
`"Wonderful. `
`I am generous to those who respect me. `
`...*cackle*cackle*...!" `
`"Don't screw with me!!! `
`Do you think I'll accept your existence because of this cheap act?! `
`Like hell you're a thousand-year-old witch! `
`Your tricks aren't a thousand years old, they're just the sum of a century of classic tricks from the mystery genre! `
`There's no such thing as magic!! `
`Definitely not!! `
`All of the crimes can be explained with 'human tricks'!!" `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`You would explain my thousand years with a hundred years of humans...? `
`Good, good, that's why I like you...!" `
`"...Foolish Battler... `
`Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi...!" `
`"...Cut it out, Battler-kun... `
`You can't... `
`go...against the witch..." `
`"............nn... `
`......u... `
`............u..." `
`Shannon started moaning, holding her cheek. `
`...Maybe she had a toothache. `
`But apparently, it wasn't a toothache after all. `
`...A slight redness spread across the cheek Shannon was holding. `
`It looked like that redness was causing Shannon unbearable pain... `
`Her fingers were pressing in against her cheek, and drops of sweat appeared all over her body... `
`"...Shannon, `
`...Shannon...!! `
`Hang in there...hang in there!" `
`"What's going on?! `
`Damn it, what the hell is that red stuff...?!" `
`It expanded rapidly, covering half of Shannon's face... `
`...Then, the stupid dunce Battler finally realized... `
`"Ple‐please, Battler‐kun...! `
`Please believe in Beatrice‐sama...! `
`I beg you...!! `
`Aaaaaaah, because you won't believe, `
`because you won't believe, aaaaaaaaaah, `
`...the magic is `
`...the magic is dissolviiiiiiiing!!" `
`For the first time in his life, ...Battler heard that sound, like a pomegranate splitting. `
`The red spray even landed on Battler's face... `
`Poor Shannon's face had been split in half, ...and her last horrible moments in that storehouse were repeated once again. `
`"U-Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh, Shannon, Shannon!! `
`Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!!" `
`"Ngg...nnnnnggg, damn it, damn iiiiiiiiiiit! `
`Stop it, stop it, stop it!! `
`Don't humiliate the dead, don't humiliate the deeeeeaaaaad!!" `
`"Uuuu, ...gah, ...eeeggh!!" `
`This time, the redness spread across George's entire body... `
`It was like the beautiful cloud drawn by milk when it's poured into black tea. `
`It spread out and extended across his entire body. `
`...As it did, it seemed to give George increasingly greater pain. `
`Looking at this bizarre spectacle, ...Battler was petrified as he frantically thought with his pitifully clumsy imagination... `
`about the nature of this strange death George and the rest were experiencing... `
`Eventually, ...that redness reached the nearby Jessica as well... `
`"Gah, `
`...eeh, `
`...ack, `
`......hh!!" `
`"S-Stop it, stop it, stop it!!! `
`What did Aniki do, `
`what did Jessica do, `
`just STOP IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!!!" `
`"Ba‐ `
`Battler, `
`...d- `
`don't let the witch `
`...break your spirit...! `
`...Deny her, `
`erase her... `
`...A-As long as at least one person denies her, `
`she's an illusion that can't exist...! `
`Aaaaahhhh, gghhh!!" `
`"A-Are you okay, Jessica?!! `
`Whaa, A-Aniki?!?!" `
`George was no longer recognizable as a human. `
`...He looked like the pile of leftover meat after the good, delicious meat has been scraped off to be cooked. `
`...The only thing that even resembled a human was the shape of his lower jaw and rib cage. `
`And it was clear that Jessica, who was covered with a steadily strengthening redness, was approaching the same fate. `
`"............Uu. `
`...Battler. `
`......Quick, believe in Beatrice... `
`...If you don't, `
`...everyone's magic... `
`...will dissolve..." `
`"M-Maria, it's all over your body, too...!!!" `
`"I revive all the dead with my magic. `
`...But as long as you don't believe, that magic will hold no true power. `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*! `
`But I'm sure that a man like yourself won't surrender to something like this, right...?" `
`"Ba‐ `
`Battler...! `
`We... `
`...didn't want to doubt our friends... `
`We refused to face reality... `
`and gave in to the witch...! `
`But... `
`Battler, you won't... `
`...won't... `
`give in to the witch...! `
`Geh, `
`ggghh, `
`...gggggghhkkkkkkk!!!" `
`"Jessica, Jessicaaaaaaa, gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!" `
`Poor Jessica met the same end. `
`...Just like George, she ended up like a butcher's leftovers. `
`George and Jessica were now so destroyed, melted and mixed up, it was impossible to tell them apart. `
`"...Battler, `
`don't cry. `
`...Beatrice will restore the dead over and over. `
`So there's nothing to be sad about... `
`......So, `
`......even if we die, we're still... `
`...just... `
`fine..." `
`The redness began eating into the whole of Maria's body... `
`The foolish Battler watched and screamed. `
`"I won't forgive you, I'll never forgive you!! `
`A witch?! Magic?! `
`I'll risk my body and soul to deny you...!! `
`No matter what happens, I can't accept you!! `
`Now that you've gone so far to piss me off, I'll never forgive you!!" `
`"I won't forgive, I won't forgive, I definitely won't forgive you!! `
`You'll regret making me, Ushiromiya Battler, your enemy!! `
`I'll deny you no matter what!! `
`No matter how baffling things get, it can all be explained by 'humans'!!! `
`I'll erase every cell of you from this world!!!" `
`"Well said! Battler, was it...? `
`That's just the thing to divert me from my thousand years of boredom! `
`Come, explain. `
`Try explaining it all with 'human tricks'! `
`And learn how lowly humans are!! `
`Let's see if what humanity has built up in a hundred years can oppose my thousand years!! `
`That's what will make forcing you to submit so pleasant...!!" `
`"So tell me, you who call yourself Battler! `
`What about Maria's letter? `
`How the six were killed? `
`The shutter? `
`The receipt's seal? `
`The closed room with the chain? `
`Kanon in the boiler room? `
`Genji and the others in the lounge?! `
`Natsuhi's suicide?! `
`The riddle of the epitaph?! `
`The location of the hidden gold?!" `
`"Yes, Battler, why don't you show me the power of 'humans'?! `
`Fuhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!" `
`"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!" `
