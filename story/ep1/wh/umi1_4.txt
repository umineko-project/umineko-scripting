`The Ushiromiya family conference was held once every year, on the first weekend of October. `
`If a normal family were to hold a so-called "family conference", `
`you'd expect it to be nothing more than a reunion of rarely seen relatives who greet each other around buckets of sushi or something. `
`However, part of the family's great fortune had been lent out to Grandfather's children, `
`and no one in this family was considered an adult until they had met with success in business, `
`so this meeting literally was a conference. `
`How much of the fortune was invested? What sort of business was conducted? How much profit was earned? `
`As a result, how much of the fortune borrowed from the main family could be repaid? `
`Or, possibly, how much more would be borrowed for future business ventures? `
`What lessons had they learned, and what could they learn from their mistakes? `
`It seems that topics like these were discussed very seriously in the past. `
`My dad said it was like lying on a bed of nails. `
`Apparently, it used to be a very serious family meeting, where people were bathed in scornful and angry voices, and some people even got slapped despite their age. `
`However, that had become a thing of the past. `
`Now, with everyone pursuing their own business ventures and achieving success, `
`it was becoming more of a normal yearly get-together. `
`Even so, telling Grandfather about recent events was extremely stressful, `
`so while it was nothing more than a simple get-together for us grandchildren, it was still a real stomachache for our parents. `
`The absence of the man who was the source of all this trouble, regardless of the reason, probably made today's lunch taste much more delicious. `
`The phrase "While the demon is not around, everyone can relax" comes to mind. `
`Anyway, let's introduce Jessica's father, whose face I haven't seen for six years. `
`The man sitting to my father's left is his older brother and Jessica's father, `
`Uncle {p:0:蔵臼}. `
`......This name sure is easy to read. `
`Krauss ({p:0:蔵臼}). `
`...Now that we've gotten used to this string of weird names, our perspective is totally skewed, `
`so Krauss doesn't actually seem that bad. `
`It even starts to sound kinda cool... `
`Just like with Aunt Natsuhi, I didn't have many memories of speaking with Uncle Krauss. `
`He had never been one to chat to children, and I felt like he was always talking with the adults, just like Aunt Natsuhi. `
`According to my father's gossip, he was a spiteful and violent man. `
`If what he said is true, Uncle Krauss used to be very domineering from his position as the oldest sibling `
`...and was despised by all the other siblings. `
`...Though, despite that, those siblings all seem to be chatting happily together. `
`Oh, well. Even if their relationship was bad when they were children, sometimes when people grow up and live apart from each other, their relationships change. `
`That's probably what this was. `
`After all, they all had children of about the same age. `
`By sharing the same family environment, they probably profited by exchanging opinions. `
`Maybe because of that, a short while ago the circle of parents began to discuss the exams Jessica and I would be taking. `
`Jessica, in order to escape questions about exams from my father on her left, `
`purposefully faced right while firing off a rapid series of comments, not giving him any chance to get a word in. `
`Moving on, let's look at the end opposite from Krauss and the others. `
`In the very last seat at the table, an old gentleman with a sturdy physique sat facing Kyrie-san. `
`This was my first time meeting him. `
`I had only just been introduced to him, but it seems he's Grandfather's personal doctor, a man called Nanjo ({p:0:南條}). `
`I heard he used to own a huge clinic on the nearby island of Niijima, but he turned it over to his son and began living a life of leisure in his old age. `
`He had known Grandfather since the very beginning, when the mansion was first constructed on this island, and had built up a relationship over several decades. `
`I thought at first that the two of them might've gotten to know each other through Grandfather's suspicious hobbies, but it seems he was actually Grandfather's chess partner. `
`......I see. That kind of hobby seems very like our Grandfather, what with his love of all things Western. `
`Nanjo's probably the only person who could enter Rokkenjima despite being neither a family member nor a servant. `
`He looked like a calm old gentleman as he listened to the discussion between Kyrie and the other women, who sat near to him. `
`...Considering how long he stayed by the side of our short-tempered Grandfather, his generous heart was probably nothing to laugh at. `
`...Still, even if he was a family doctor, having anyone outside the Ushiromiya family attend the family conference was a little odd. `
`It made me think that Grandfather's condition might've worsened so much, it'd be a major topic of discussion at today's conference... `
`After all, George said something like that just a second ago. `
`Something about how we've been getting continuous reports since around last year that Grandfather didn't have long to live. `
`...It's nasty to think about it, but consider how rich Grandfather is. `
`At the time of his death, his wealth will suddenly be released, probably along with a fair share of our parents' stomach acid, `
`and it'll lead to ulcers for everyone. `
`After all, this sort of thing just gets messier when there's more wealth to be divided. `
`There's a good chance they'll be talking about stuff like that at the family conference. `
`...Still, it's not like it's got anything to do with us kids. `
`......Finally, even though he hasn't shown up, let me introduce our Grandfather. `
`The person who should be sitting in that "Incipient's Chair" is Ushiromiya Kinzo. `
`...It really sucks. `
`Everyone else in the family has these weird names, but he's got this perfectly normal one himself. `
`If only his name were written Kinzo ({p:0:金蔵}), but he let us call him "Goldsmith" or something, `
`I'd totally freak out. `
`As you can probably guess by now, he's a frightening person with an extremely short temper. `
`I'm one of his grandchildren, not a son, and I haven't seen him since elementary school. `
`Thanks to that, I have no memory of being beaten myself, but our parents were apparently raised with an iron fist. `
`That earlier conversation between my dad and Uncle Krauss, about who should go convince Grandfather to come down, `
`seems pretty darn funny once you know their background. `
`You can't really tell Grandfather's story without covering that pivotal event back before the {ruby:1926-1989:Showa} era. `
`Until the {ruby:1868–1912:Meiji} and {ruby:1912–1926:Taisho} eras, the Ushiromiya family was great and prosperous. `
`They owned several spinning mills, making them rich enough to just double over laughing every day as the money kept rolling in. `
`Incidentally, Grandfather was a member of a branch family and had pretty much nothing to do with the main family. `
`Not only was he way down the list of people who could inherit the Headship, but he had hardly any contact with the glamorous main family. `
`However, during the Great Kanto Earthquake in {ruby:Taisho 12:1923}, the mansion owned by the Ushiromiya family in Odawara was flattened. `
`The spinning mills in Tokyo were all burned down in a huge fire, `
`and the Ushiromiya family lost most of its wealth and family members in an instant. `
`So, once they started trying to figure out who the successor to the Ushiromiya family should be, they apparently found no one remaining except Kinzo in his branch family. `
`In Kinzo's later reminiscences, he referred to this as good fortune so great that it overturned fate. `
`With that, Grandfather's boring, everyday life did a 180. `
`He was entrusted with reviving the dying Ushiromiya family, which had lost nearly all of its wealth. `
`However, just because he had been entrusted with this task didn't mean he could accomplish it. `
`Apparently, those around him weren't really expecting much. `
`However, this is when Grandfather began displaying his extraordinary talent and good luck. `
`Grandfather used all of the family's remaining wealth, as well as everything from the hair on his head to his toenails, as collateral in order to borrow a massive amount of money. `
`Once he'd built up a gigantic war chest, he immediately invested in businesses. `
`It was like someone tumbling down a hill on a bike without any brakes... `
`...And then jumping onto a neighboring bike, and then another one! `
`Just like some crazy street performance. `
`I'll bet everyone thought Grandfather had no business ability whatsoever. `
`However, after several miracles and turns of good luck, with coincidences piling up and every chance taken advantage of, `
`he was suddenly in control of powerful connections with the occupying forces. `
`At that time, McArthur and the GHQ were the ultimate authority in Japan. `
`Grandfather, in a twinkle of an eye, began succeeding in business under the protection of the occupying forces, quickly becoming very rich. `
`By this point, it's probably safe to say that information, not luck, saved the day. `
`He must have made some seriously deep connections with the occupying forces. `
`......Grandfather knew beforehand about emergency demands that would be made for the Korean War. `
`No, it was more than that.  He must have predicted those emergency demands from the very beginning, when he started investing his money. `
`The history books make it sound like all of Japan made a large profit off of the emergency demands during the Korean War, but that isn't actually true. `
`Only a very limited number of the super rich played the money game and made an easy profit. `
`Most of the citizens remained poor. `
`...In other words, Grandfather was a member of this extremely lucky group of winners. `
`I'm pretty sure this all happened during {ruby:Showa 25:1950} or so. `
`The Great Kanto Earthquake happened in {ruby:Taisho 13:1924}, so... `
`......That means Grandfather was able to revive the near-dead Ushiromiya family in only about 20 years to a level even higher than it had ever been before. `
`With that, you'd think he'd revive the main family in Odawara, `
`but for some reason, he went and did something as crazy as buying an entire small island in the Izu archipelago. `
`Buying an entire island is not something that you can ordinarily do today. `
`However, Grandfather was clever. `
`He contacted the GHQ and applied for the establishment of a marine resource base. `
`He acquired this island as a business property, then tossed that project aside and claimed it as his own plot of land. `
`After the war, there were prevention measures against food shortages, and having the sponsorship of the GHQ meant that nobody could oppose him. `
`From what I've heard, the Tokyo Metropolis of that day offered this land to him practically for free. `
`Later, Tokyo made difficulties by telling Kinzo to return the land, but the pushy GHQ intervened. `
`Anyway, it seems under-the-table bribes did their work well. `
`In the end, the city gave up in frustration. `
`Grandfather, with considerable skill and good luck, managed to weather the stormy seas of that period, `
`obtaining a vast fortune and his own island. `
`Of course, it probably wasn't all luck. `
`He was obsessed with all things Western, which helped him cultivate his English skills. `
`He was able to use this to his advantage and sink his teeth into the GHQ. `
`A mansion was built on the island soon after. `
`This mansion, in fact. `
`Grandfather, with his love of the Western style, made this once uninhabited island a canvas upon which he could realize his dreams to his heart's content. `
`...He now had the Western mansion of his dreams, overflowing with emotion and atmosphere, and a beautiful garden featuring all sorts of roses. `
`And, he had a private beach where nobody other than himself would ever be permitted to leave a footprint. `
`......This would be a dream come true for any boy. `
`After that, he made good use of his huge fortune, `
`becoming a large stockholder in the extremely stable iron and steel industry, and was able to live an easy and comfortable life just using the dividends. `
`Well, he's just that incredible. `
`This kind of person usually has the ability to foresee and predict the future, or at least that is how they're portrayed after the fact. `
`But Grandfather denies all of that, `
`repeatedly saying that he was simply blessed with extraordinary luck... `
`......Anyway, even a lord like that can't help but grow increasingly eccentric when locked up alone on an island `
`, where all his dreams are made real. `
`Everyone knows that he's had a Western obsession from the start, `
`but none of our parents really know when his bizarre black magic hobby began. `
`Did his love of black magic begin way back when he became fascinated with everything Western, `
`or did his miraculous stretch of good luck while reviving his family cause him to feel a mysterious power in himself? `
`At some point, Grandfather began to make the research of black magic his life's work. `
`He filled his study up with suspicious books, chemicals, and magical items as he became increasingly bizarre. `
`From what I've heard, those around him warmly (?) watched over him, figuring that someone who had achieved success in life had a right to do as he pleased, but... `
`...There's no way that's true. `
`They were probably just creeped out, thinking "That's disgusting, I don't want to get involved." `
`Anyway, ...that agitated period was an age of big gambles, with both opportunities and risks. `
`Let's say Grandfather was born in this time period. `
`He would've had no opportunities and would probably have advanced like a chess piece from mandatory education to college at a leisurely pace, `
`never becoming more than an average salaryman. `
`If that happened, he'd probably have sat somewhere, happily talking behind his boss's back. `
`No, no. Not in a fancy dining hall like this. More like at a table in some bar. `
`Then again, I'll bet this family conference would be a whole lot more relaxing if that were the case. `
`Okay, that's enough about the old geezer. `
`More importantly, let's talk about this incredible lunch!! `
`"I'm already convinced by that sashimi salad appetizer! `
`Gohda-san's an excellent chef! `
`Plus, these fish were caught in the adjacent seas, weren't they?! `
`They're totally different from the sashimi you get at the supermarket!" `
`"Hey, quit it, Battler. `
`Your upbringing will be exposed." `
`Everyone let out a big laugh. `
`Damn it, you say that even though you love those cheap pubs. `
`"Hahahaha. `
`I've eaten at many unusual places because of work, but this stands right up there with the best of them. `
`I'd be willing to bet Gohda-san used to be pretty well known in those circles." `
`"Well, I don't know the details, `
`but stuff got complicated at the long-standing hotel he used to work at, what with them opening a new establishment with the same name and breaking into factions or whatever it was. `
`In the middle of all that, he was apparently forced to retire. `
`At that time, Mom just happened to be sending out job offers for a servant." `
`As Gohda removed the empty plates, he began to recount his own bumpy past without losing his smile. `
`"The world is a difficult place. `
`However, thanks to the Madam, I was given a chance to display my skills as a chef once again, this time for the Ushiromiya family. `
`Although I enjoy experiencing the smiles of a larger number of people, `
`I also find it quite entertaining to perform more delicate work that can please the limited number of those who have employed me. `
`All this is thanks to the opportunity given to me by the Madam." `
`Gohda-san respectfully bowed his head towards Aunt Natsuhi. `
`"That's because you were the most talented of the applicants. `
`The decision was purely objective, not based on personal feelings, so there is no need to thank me." `
`...Dang, why does Aunt Natsuhi always have to sound so indifferent? `
`If only she spoke with a bit more kindness, she might leave a different impression. `
`Shannon-chan and Kumasawa-san entered from the hallway with a serving cart. `
`"...Please excuse us." `
`"Now then, let us move on to today's dessert." `
`Gohda-san and the others laid the beautifully adorned dessert out in front of us all. `
`I guess it's true when they say you have another stomach for dessert... `
`I'd thought I'd already filled up on delicious food, `
`but as soon as I laid eyes on that dessert, my stomach started yelling "More!" `
`I don't know much about desserts, but this looked really good. `
`A white pudding-like substance was garnished with two shades of red sauce, `
`and elegant rose petals adorned the dish. `
`Normally, during a high-class meal like this, `
`you're supposed to wait for the chef to extol the virtues of this particular meal before eating. `
`However, Maria was completely indifferent to strict rules like that, so she got excited by this beautiful and delicious-looking dessert, jumping into the fray as soon as it was placed before her. `
`Aunt Rosa scolded her, calling it bad manners, but George responded by saying "Now, now, it's okay." `
`"Uu-?! `
`This part's sour! `
`This part's sour! `
`Battler, this one's no good! `
`Uu-!" `
`Maria exclaimed as she sampled the two colored sauces. `
`"What, some are good and some bad? Okay, I'll give it a go! `
`Mmmmm?!" `
`Apparently, one sauce was sweet and the other sour. `
`Despite it being bad manners, I also stuck my little finger in and licked it. `
`Whoa, one of the sauces was sour enough to make you pucker up. `
`If it were yellow, I'd have suspected lemon, but I couldn't guess what kind of sourness would be red. `
`I decided to ask Shannon, who was putting away the serving cart behind us. `
`"Shannon-chan, what kind of sauce is this sour stuff?" `
`"......Umm...... `
`............uhh, `
`......aaah..." `
`Shannon‐chan hesitated to speak. `
`Maybe her job was just to set the table, so she doesn't really know. `
`Still, even considering that, she seems pretty stressed. `
`......Maybe I shouldn't have asked. `
`Or did they use some ingredient that we'd be better off not knowing about? `
`While Aunt Natsuhi made a gesture that seemed to indicate an oncoming headache, Kumasawa-san, who was setting the table at the opposite seat, began to chuckle. `
`"What do you think we made it out of? `
`Hohohoh, it'll shock you..." `
`"Huh? I-I don't have a clue. `
`Wait a sec, Kumasawa baa-san, that laugh's pretty creepy. `
`So, what is it?!" `
`"...Don't tell anyone, okay? `
`Listen very carefully." `
`Kumasawa-san leaned across from the other side of the table. `
`I leaned forward myself when she asked. `
`Their interest caught, Jessica, George-aniki, and, of course, Maria also put their ears closer. `
`"Uu-. `
`What? `
`Whaaat? `
`Quickly! `
`Quickly!" `
`"You see, the sour part is made from... `
`juice squeezed from a mackerel, hohohoh!" `
`"""WHAT, mackerel?!?!""" `
`"That's crazy," we all thought, horrified. `
`Only Maria accepted it, nodding sagely. `
`"Uu-? `
`Mackerels are sour. `
`This is what comes out when you squeeze them!" `
`""...ha, wahahahahaha...!"" `
`When Maria started clamoring that mackerel were sour, the adults were unable to contain their laughter. `
`Only Aunt Rosa, her face red, `
`whispered to Maria that mackerel is sour only once {ruby:vinegared:prepared as shimesaba}. `
`Aaahh, now I totally remember. `
`Kumasawa-san was always like this, wasn't she? `
`I think I remember her tricking me too in all sorts of ways when I was young! `
`The most lethal has gotta be that one! `
`Those flimsy black things in Chinese dishes! `
`They're kikurage mushrooms! `
`She told me they were penguin meat and I went all around school like a smartass telling everyone, didn't I?! `
`"Kumasawa baa-chan, you sure haven't changed...! `
`You know Maria's gonna believe it now, right?" `
`"Hohohoh, it's just a joke. `
`Now Gohda-san's going to tell us what the sauce really is, won't he?" `
`Gohda looked a little put off about his masterpiece being laughed at for such a bizarre reason, `
`but after clearing his throat once, he introduced the dessert to us. `
`"Well then, allow me to introduce our dessert. `
`After seeing how much you all enjoyed the rose garden earlier today, I finished this panna cotta in a rose garden style. `
`The rose petals scattered across were selected just now from that very rose garden. `
`The sauce is a combination of two reds, strawberry and rose hips. `
`Please enjoy this mixture of the strawberry's sweetness and the rose hip's sourness. `
`Furthermore, the rose petals are merely decorative, so please avoid them while you eat. `
`With that said, please, enjoy." `
`......Whoa...... Man, I almost want to applaud before eating. `
`Just like with medicine, reading the detailed description first seems to make it work a whole lot better. `
`As Gohda-san elaborated on the details of this dessert, it started to feel even more appetizing. `
`Seriously, should you call him subtle or just talented? `
`The dessert was probably planned from the beginning, but taking the hint when we all stopped in front of the rose garden earlier today, `
`he displayed an incredible and timely awareness by just adding a few rose petals from that garden. `
`This combination of sweet and sour was also exquisite. `
`If it was just sweet, you'd just get used to it and bored halfway through. `
`But if you reached the sour sauce at that point, you'd get a really vivid taste. `
`And then, once you returned to the sweet sauce, all of the sourness in your mouth would be replaced with an enjoyable sweetness. `
`I'm sure everyone else felt the same way. `
`Every time Gohda-san passed by one of our seats, someone praised the taste and his presentation. `
`"How is it, Madam?" `
`"Splendid, as always. `
`It is worthy of entertaining our guests." `
`"I am most grateful for your words. `
`......Madam, did you know? `
`I have heard that rose hip has the ability to cure headaches. `
`I thought that you in particular would appreciate it, so I had it specially prepared." `
`"...Is that so? `
`Thank you." `
`"See, didn't I tell you, Natsuhi nee-san? `
`Rose hip is great for headaches." `
`"So it seems. `
`...I do hope it actually helps." `
`"Haa-! `
`Gohda-san, I love ya! `
`Hey, later on, why don't you tell me how they're treatin' ya?! `
`Or if ya can't, just let me know what sort of salary you'd like! `
`Havin' your talent confined to this small island is sacrilege to humanity's cookin' culture! `
`What d'ya think about working your craft for my company and delightin' all our customers?!" `
`"Hahaha, Hideyoshi-san, `
`are you trying to steal away our Gohda? `
`Now that won't do at all. `
`We'd better start treating Gohda better, or he'll get snatched up." `
`"*giggle* Yes, you really should. `
`If you don't, someone's gonna grab him, and you'll be stuck with three meals of Kumasawa-style mackerel cooking a day, won't you?" `
`"Hohohoh, that's harsh. `
`It seems someone's holding a grudge against me." `
`"""Wahahahahaha!!!""" `
`Everyone let out a huge laugh. `
`According to Jessica, Kumasawa-san's mackerel jokes were a running gag that our parents had long since gotten used to. `
`Kumasawa-san often claimed that mackerels had precious nutritional value, `
`which could slow aging, make people smarter and more. `
`...Supposedly, while it couldn't stop the outward signs of aging, it helped prevent aging on the inside. `
`Since she was still spirited enough to tell these kinds of jokes at her age, there must be something to that theory. `
`"Hohohoh... `
`In that case, if you'll excuse me... `
`Prepare yourself for tonight's dinner! `
`I'll be cooking plenty of mackerel dishes for you all, so you'd better look forward to it!" `
`"Wahahaha, we sure will. `
`Can't wait to get all puckered up from tonight's shimesaba!" `
`"That sounds wonderful. `
`I wonder if they'll be serving any good Japanese sake." `
`"Oh, we certainly will. `
`Haven't you heard of Rokkenjima's famous mackerel {ruby:liquor:shochu}...?" `
`"""Wahahahahahaha!!!""" `
`Kumasawa-san, together with Shannon-chan, bowed and pushed the serving cart away. `
`It was pretty funny to watch Gohda-san, who looked like his show had totally been stolen, explain in a serious voice that we would be having calf steak for dinner. `
`"...Umm, `
`......Kumasawa-san, ...thanks for doing that back there..." `
`As she pushed the serving cart, Shannon bowed her head very deeply. `
`"Hohohoh, I haven't done anything that requires thanks." `
`Kumasawa may have played dumb, but she had obviously understood and saved Shannon in the nick of time. `
`Back when Battler had asked about dessert, Shannon had unfortunately hesitated. `
`There may have been several ways to dodge the question, but all of them would have required some quick wits. `
`Shannon, who hesitated when hard-pressed for a response, was always suffering because of this small weakness. `
`If only Shannon had a little of the craftiness needed to cleverly shake off a mistake, like Gohda, her life would've been a bit easier. `
`The fact that she could perform other tasks flawlessly made this weakness even more unfortunate. `
`However, there were some who understood Shannon's honest nature, her inability to gloss over a mistake and draw attention away from it. `
`...That was why Kumasawa had smoothly come to her rescue. `
`"I just heard from Genji-san that there will be a change in the afternoon shifts. `
`I believe you were given a break until this evening. `
`Hohohoh, I'm jealous." `
`"Huh? ...Oh, sorry, I haven't checked the shift chart yet." `
`"Ah, yes. `
`I was thinking I might start cooking some mackerel in the oven. `
`If you don't mind, I would be happy if you would help out a bit before your break." `
`"Ah, yes...! `
`I would be delighted to help." `
`To Shannon, Kumasawa was like a mother among the servants. `
`The dining hall needed to be cleaned up, so we were chased out. `
`Instead, tea was being served in the parlor. `
`Apparently, they'd prepared the black tea that Aunt Rosa had bought for Aunt Natsuhi. `
`Maria said she also wanted to have some black tea, but my old bastard said she couldn't and told us children to go play outside. `
`"Battler-kun, why don't we all go for a walk outside?" `
`"Go ahead and take a look at the roses or somethin'. `
`But keep a close eye on the weather. `
`The sky's still clear, but the weather report kept on talkin' about rain." `
`"Uu-! `
`I wanna go to the beach, the beach!!" `
`"Oh, that sounds wonderful. `
`Playing on a sandy beach isn't something you get to do often, is it?" `
`"Ah, good point. `
`Okay, let's all go to the beach then!" `
`"Uu-! Let's go, let's go!" `
`"Maria, be careful not to get your clothes wet. `
`Or your shoes." `
`"Uu-! `
`Won't get wet!" `
`"*giggle* That obedience is so cuuute. `
`Battler-kun, make sure you keep an eye out for Maria-chan, okay?" `
`"Sure, leave it to me!" `
`"Hey, you're pretty obedient and cute yourself, listening to Kyrie like that. `
`...Why don't you also listen to me obediently for a change?" `
`"Hah! `
`Hell no! `
`Let's go everyone, c'mon!" `
`The children flew out of the parlor. `
`They were replaced by Genji, who pushed a serving cart in and prepared to serve the tea. `
`The parlor was filled with a sublime aroma which delighted everyone while they waited to sate their thirst... `
`"Hahahahah, ha... `
`Rudolf's family certainly seems close. `
`It's a wonderful thing." `
`"Quit it. We're no match for your family, Aniki." `
`"That's true. `
`You've raised Jessica-chan to be so adorable. `
`I imagine that's yet another fruit of your talents at education and training, Natsuhi nee-san." `
`"......Thank you." `
`Natsuhi answered coldly. `
`...The conversation broke off then, and the parlor fell silent. `
`Maybe Hideyoshi couldn't bear the silence, because he broke it himself with an exaggerated gesture. `
`"Still, they sure do grow fast. `
`...I thought they'd be kids forever, but they start gettin' huge all of a sudden, and then they're adults like us. `
`Battler-kun looks like a completely different person now!" `
`"His body has grown much bigger, but he's still just a kid. `
`Though you could say the same about my husband." `
`"...I wonder where the border between child and adult is. `
`I still don't feel as though I've grown up." `
`"Hmph, isn't that pitiful. `
`That's not something the mother of a child should say." `
`"That's right. `
`We're not children anymore. `
`We're all adults now. `
`So I wish we could talk together on an intellectual level, rather than an emotional one." `
`When Eva smiled with sharp sarcasm, everyone seemed to get more tense. `
`...It felt as though that pleasant tea aroma had been tossed out the window. `
`"Since long ago, we've always endeavored to engage in intellectual conversations. `
`......It seems your sarcasm occasionally misses its mark. `
`Just as it always has." `
`"...Oh, what is it you've "always endeavored" to do? `
`My, my. `
`I wish I could wrap those words up and send them to this room a few decades ago. `
`Right, Rosa?" `
`"..............." `
`Rosa gave a vague smile. `
`She knew that, whether she agreed or disagreed, she'd earn the displeasure of one of her siblings. `
`It was a bit of worldly wisdom that had been essential for someone growing up as the youngest sibling. `
`"Quit it, Aneki. `
`We'd better get started on our main topic while the brats aren't around. `
`Let us make that our intellectual discussion." `
`As Rudolf glanced over the faces of all present, some let out a slight sigh and some let a small look of resignation cross their face. `
`......They were approaching their unavoidable... `
`true agenda. `
`"Last year, his life expectancy was estimated at about three months. `
`Which I guess means he's got negative 9 months left now. `
`Should we take that to mean it might suddenly happen at any time?" `
`"...The Family Head is still alive and well. `
`The fact that you'd bring up such an inappropriate topic under the light of day...makes me doubt your sanity, Rudolf-san." `
`"Still, Natsuhi-san, `
`this is the sort of thing you can't put off until after somethin' happens. `
`He's still healthy now, which makes this the perfect time to talk about this, while we've still got time to plan. `
`It's just a bit of financial etiquette, you might say." `
`"It seems Father is the focus of everyone's concern. `
`...Doctor Nanjo, `
`could we hear the details from you? `
`That appears to be what everyone else is waiting for, after all." `
`".....................*cough*." `
`Nanjo, who had been standing by the window and staring out at the rose garden, let out a single cough when he realized that he was being called. `
`"...Doctor Nanjo, `
`...how is Father's condition?" `
`"Well, to begin, `
`...allow me to start with a revision, since my estimate last year that he had only three months left was not borne out." `
`"No need to explain. `
`You're saying that measuring remaining life is only a prediction, not a promise, right?" `
`"...That is correct. `
`Because of that, while I will accept everyone's repeated questions, I can by no means confirm when he will pass away. `
`A human's life is supported by their body and their mind. `
`...If the body is weak, the situation becomes more dangerous, but if the mind is strong enough to compensate for that weakness, the effects of one's condition can sometimes remain in a subdued state." `
`"So you're saying that even if his body is weak, his mind is still firm and spirited." `
`".........Kyrie, sorry, but please stay quiet for a bit." `
`"......I'm sorry." `
`"That is correct. `
`Kinzo-san's body is being overwhelmed by the demon of ill health. `
`This will hold especially true as long as he continues to partake of such strong alcohol..." `
`"So, he's in a crisis now because he drinks. `
`And maybe he's lived this long because he drinks. `
`There's Dad for you, the heavy drinker." `
`"Well then, Doctor, I know you can't give anything more than a prediction, `
`...but what do you think about Father's chances of living until this day next year...?" `
`"That's quite a rude question to ask about the Family Head." `
`Natsuhi jumped on Eva, not even bothering to hide her astonished expression. `
`Eva stared back daringly, but Hideyoshi realized what was going on and tried to smooth things over with a forced smile. `
`"Ah, Natsuhi-san, forgive her! `
`Eva, choose your words a bit more carefully, okay?" `
`"I'm sorry. `
`I was just so concerned about Father's condition. `
`*giggle*." `
`"...Is that so? `
`I hadn't realized." `
`"Doctor Nanjo, please tell us. `
`For the sake of the beautiful love of a daughter worried about her father's lifespan." `
`Krauss laughed sarcastically, and Eva, smiling sweetly, returned an identical chuckle. `
`"...You ask whether he will still be healthy next year, `
`......but as a doctor, it is very hard to say. `
`Because while I do think this lull in his condition will continue for a while, `
`if he suffers some kind of fit, there may be nothing we can do. `
`......After all, Rokkenjima is a solitary island. `
`It is not as though an ambulance could quickly jump in to save him. `
`Normally, I would want to have him placed in a large hospital on the mainland, but..." `
`"Father stated that he does not want his noble research interrupted. `
`......It seems he holds a grudge over the way we tried to force him out last year. `
`Apparently, he strongly suspects that he'll be shut away in some hospital if he goes outside. `
`And that's how things are now." `
`"Has Doctor Nanjo been examining him?" `
`"Father trusts Doctor Nanjo. `
`...It seems he can be examined when in one of his better moods..." `
`"I can examine his condition, but if I try to recommend medicine or hospitalization, he refuses to listen. `
`......I've really only been able to look." `
`"It's true some people hate doctors... `
`Still, what a hassle!" `
`Nanjo sighed deeply. `
`The purpose of an examination is to determine what medical treatment would be appropriate. `
`Receiving an examination and then not following the advice given makes the whole thing pointless... `
`"So, to sum it up, `
`he's still expected to live three months. `
`There's no way to guess how long he'll continue to live while still on the verge of death." `
`"......Rudolf-san, `
`couldn't you be a little more discreet with your words?" `
`"Ah, sorry. `
`I've always talked this way. `
`Give me a break." `
`"I understand how Doctor Nanjo sees it. `
`...What about you, Krauss nii-san?" `
`"......Hmph. `
`To be perfectly honest, I have to disagree with Doctor Nanjo. `
`I find it truly difficult to think of Father as a person so sick that he has only three months to live. `
`His yell is as healthy as ever, and I still get chills at the thought of his fists raining down on me. `
`......Pushing the care of your father solely on the shoulders of the eldest sibling is far from fair." `
`"Hahhaha. `
`In the next world, get born after me. `
`.........Okay, let's get back on track. `
`So, in the opinion of our impartial and neutral doctor, it wouldn't be odd for him to go any time. `
`No offense to you, Aniki, but I'd rather trust the opinion of an expert in his field. `
`Which means it's definitely not too early to start talking about Dad's assets." `
`"Father's personal funds probably reach as high as several ten billion yen, right? `
`But it's not as though that's all neatly gathered as ready cash. `
`It's not as simple as simply cutting a birthday cake with a knife." `
`"...That's an interesting way to put it. `
`That's right, you sometimes get strawberries or chocolates on top of the cake, making it hard to cleanly cut it into equal parts. `
`Given that, don't you think it's important to discuss beforehand how best to stick the knife in...?" `
`"I cannot understand how you all can openly discuss this as though the Family Head is dead, even though he's still alive." `
`"Come now, don't you see how important this is? `
`After all, when the time comes, the inheritance of his fortune must be carried out immediately, right? `
`Moreover, the glorious Ushiromiya house's wealth is vast. `
`Don't you understand that careful discussion is necessary beforehand? `
`There's a huge difference between this family's resources and your family's wealth." `
`"......How rude! `
`My birth family has nothing to do with this." `
`Natsuhi responded indignantly, though in a low voice, and the already dark atmosphere grew even more hostile... `
`"Give it a rest, Eva... `
`Natsuhi-san, forgive us! `
`Pardon her rudeness." `
`Hideyoshi tried to smooth things over by glancing at both with a forced smile, but it only resulted in making the hostility between Eva and Natsuhi even more intense... `
`"............It seems I'll just get in the way if I stay any longer. `
`Please excuse me." `
`Nanjo rose from his seat and exited the parlor. `
`...To an outsider, it may have seemed like a normal act of courtesy, but his back was watched by several glances envious of his ability to escape. `
`After the doctor had exited and his footsteps had disappeared into the distance, Krauss recrossed his legs. `
`"In other words, this is what you all would like to say... `
`Father's remaining life is short. `
`You want to quickly enter into a practical conference concerning the distribution of the inheritance. `
`......Why are you so eager, I wonder? `
`Certainly, as you say, estimating and distributing the Ushiromiya family's wealth is no simple task. `
`In that case, shouldn't we make careful and deliberate calculations? `
`It seems to me that you are all impatient to split up the cake tonight. `
`Isn't that true, Rosa? `
`What reason is there to be hasty?" `
`".........We aren't being hasty. `
`...However, we need to have an agreement between the siblings. `
`It doesn't matter when we do that, `
`but if the day Father's condition worsens is approaching, `
`discussing the matter beforehand hardly seems hasty to me..." `
`Rosa shot a glance at Eva and Rudolf. `
`...As the youngest sibling in the family, it was hard for her to be cross-examined by the eldest. `
`"......Oh? `
`Is that your true opinion? `
`I didn't expect that the most honest and pure-hearted of the siblings would say something like that. `
`I wonder if those two told you to say it..." `
`"........................" `
`"Quit it, Aniki. `
`Rosa's one of Dad's kids too. `
`She's got as much right to his inheritance as the rest of us. `
`It's only natural that she'd be interested. `
`...After all, Dad'll definitely die, and that's not something that'll happen in the distant future. `
`......On the contrary, Aniki, you're way too relaxed. `
`It almost seems like you'd like nothing better than to turn the discussion away from the inheritance issue." `
`".........What do you mean by that? `
`Are you trying to accuse my husband of something?" `
`"C-Calm down, Natsuhi-san. `
`Listen to what we have to say..." `
`"Nii-san, I hear the times have been extremely good lately. `
`Yes, since last year, we've been in an unprecedented boom, and the yen keeps on rising. `
`It seems that it's no longer a dream that the dollar will reach 100 yen. `
`Also, the ruling party says that it'll establish health resort maintenance law by next year. `
`At this moment, resort development companies across Japan are running about, trying to gather as much funding as they can." `
`"...You certainly seem to know a lot about it. `
`Japan is about to experience an unprecedented boom. `
`It'll be a repeat of the Korean War Demands, the time during which Father revived the Ushiromiya family. `
`...The people of Japan have been working like mad, achieving vast economic growth and becoming the most well-off people in the world, reaching the height of our prosperity. `
`We've reached an era where private spending is vast, which means easy money for institutions that can capitalize on that fact." `
`"The three kinds of electrical appliances no longer represent the people's needs. `
`The people need ski resorts, golf courses, public pools. `
`Resort hotels and theme parks!" `
`"Have you gone to Delsney Land, which opened just a few years ago? `
`What an excellent theme park! `
`It's a place where even an adult can be a kid and have fun with his family. `
`No longer do we count our sole virtue to be selfless devotion while failing to care for our families. `
`We have become the most prosperous people in the world, and now we can finally enjoy the benefits." `
`"Krauss-san, your foresight's nothing to sneeze at. `
`...When I heard that sort of thing several years ago, I thought it was crazy. `
`...But when I heard about the G5 nations' Plaza Accord, that all changed. `
`The yen shot up, and I'll bet the price of land skyrockets soon too. `
`It won't be long before Japan becomes the economic center of the world. `
`......You've got a great sense of the direction the world's movin', Krauss-san. `
`At least there can be no debate about that." `
`"I feel the same as Hideyoshi-san. `
`Aniki, you can read into the next decade of history. `
`I'll bet you got that keen sense from Dad, `
`and it's incredible. `
`......However, unlike Dad, the timing of your predictions has been a bit off sometimes, right?" `
`"Nii-san, you've been starting resort projects everywhere, convinced that Japan will soon see a boom, but almost all of them continue to fail. `
`...While I'm sure that the era you predicted will soon arrive, it seems you misread the timing of that boom." `
`"...You were too early. `
`You then panicked and tried to sell everything off, which only opened the wound even further. `
`...If your nose was really so reliable, then there should be no reason for you to sell off your property. `
`Is this proof that you mistrust your own ability?" `
`"......How rude! `
`Are you trying to insult my husband?" `
`Natsuhi's forehead creased as she rose from the sofa. `
`Eva, paying this no heed, stared at Krauss with a confident smile. `
`...Krauss, who also maintained his confident appearance, told Natsuhi to sit down. `
`"Please stop, Natsuhi. `
`Eva's always been incapable of talking any other way. `
`...Calm down a little, `
`or your headache will get worse." `
`"There's proof of your lack of talent right next to us. `
`......After all, Nii-san, weren't you all excited about turning this island into a resort? `
`You built a wonderful resort hotel and beautifully maintained the garden... `
`I'm just an amateur and don't pretend to understand, but you must have used a significant amount of money for that, right?" `
`"And what is that to you?! `
`My husband's business is none of yours!" `
`"Actually, that's not true, Natsuhi-san. `
`Rokkenjima doesn't belong to Aniki. `
`It belongs to Dad. `
`Of course, the hotel does belong to Aniki, right? `
`In fact, we'd be more than willing to pay lodging fees for tonight. `
`What do you think, Rosa?" `
`"......Well, hmm. `
`...If what I have on hand will suffice." `
`"If I can make it into a resort, this island's financial worth will rise. `
`It is true that expenses have piled up, but we can expect a large harvest in the future. `
`When that happens, all of you stand to profit as well, do you not?" `
`"I understand that. `
`If the value of this island rises, that'll increase our portions when we distribute the inheritance. `
`Of course, I won't ask you to divide the island and the mansion into four equal parts. `
`We can just resolve the matter with money equal to the value of the property." `
`"If you understand that much, what about my business makes you so dissatisfied?" `
`"We aren't dissatisfied, we're uneasy. `
`In the first place, Aniki, `
`when do you plan to open that hotel? `
`Left this way, you won't get anything out of it except our grubby hand prints, right?" `
`"That's right. `
`It's an important tool for your business, isn't it? `
`Surely you can't keep it locked up until the moment you open it. `
`Buildings go bad if you don't use them and air them out every once in a while. `
`Even so, it's a bit extravagant for a guesthouse that we only use once a year. `
`Right, Rosa?" `
`".........That's right. `
`Considering how wonderful it is, I'm sure it will become quite popular once you open it." `
`"Oh, `
`......so the hotel you keep talking about is the guesthouse..." `
`"It's splendid. `
`Just as Rosa said, if you were to open it, I'm sure it would become popular." `
`The lodging they had been guided to wasn't originally intended to serve as a guesthouse. `
`...It was originally constructed as a resort hotel. `
`However, even though it was built two years previously, there was still absolutely no prospect of it opening. `
`"Nii-san, it's just like all of your enterprises. `
`Your attention and planning are both fabulous. `
`Then, it always becomes unmaintainable partway through...and ends before you have a chance to earn any profit." `
`"You were brilliant when you saw that using this island only as a place to live was a waste. `
`I think it was a pretty good plan to turn it into a resort that could use the prospect of marine sports, fishing, honeymoons and the like to attract customers. `
`If I were the oldest son, I'm sure I'd have strained my brain looking for a way to make a profit off this island." `
`"But two full years have passed since you finished building, right? `
`After two years, you still haven't had the opportunity to open it. `
`Where's the managing company you entrusted it to?" `
`"......Impertinence! `
`That is not my husband's fault! `
`There has just been some trouble with the company that my husband contracted with. No matter how you look at it, we are victims here!" `
`"And yet, `
`the rumors we've heard about this company you hired... `
`...haven't been good at all." `
`"Let's be clear about this, dear. `
`...Did you really think we wouldn't hear about how lack of payment, embezzlement, and other issues led to the project disintegrating mid-flight? `
`We even have evidence." `
`"I don't know what kind of evidence you think you found, but it's all baseless! `
`As new members in the tourism industry, it is necessary for us to lay the groundwork with various people. `
`It is also important to investigate the trustworthiness of our partners. `
`It's merely taken us some time to meet that goal!" `
`"......I'll admit that, in my rashness, the hotel was completed too early. `
`However, it's not as though we're paying maintenance costs. `
`It's a foundation that will eventually become immensely significant." `
`"Liar. `
`I'll bet you want to liquidate it but can't. `
`After all, there's no reason for anyone to buy such an extravagant hotel on an isolated, empty island without any established sightseeing routes. `
`And anyway, what about all the loans you made for this project?" `
`"Even if you aren't incurring maintenance costs, the borrowed money that you can't return just keeps growing. `
`...Sorry, Krauss nii-san, `
`but I've investigated the development plan for this island a bit. `
`...To be honest, I haven't heard anything good either." `
`"Hideyoshi-san, `
`I can see how you might be left with that impression by looking only at the current financial situation. `
`However, this is a forward-looking investment. `
`I have no choice but to admit that my prediction was mistaken, and that up until now, several liabilities have been created." `
`"However, the times have finally caught up with me. `
`I will soon regain everything that I have lost up to this point. `
`No, actually, all of the investments I have made until now will finally return to my possession. `
`That's right, just like throwing away a small fry which then becomes a salmon, they will come back even bigger than before." `
`"I'll accept that. `
`The resort business will probably see an unprecedented boom before long, `
`though I don't know if it'll be enough to cover all your debt..." `
`".........However, Krauss nii-san, `
`after all your failures in the past, who exactly do you expect to provide you with funding? `
`And this isn't some small amount we're talkin's about. `
`You'll need enough funding to fill the massive hole you've dug." `
`"......What are you trying to say, Hideyoshi-san?" `
`"Ahh, Natsuhi-san, please don't get angry! `
`We looked into this, too. `
`We checked to see who might've provided Krauss nii-san with enough financing `
`to support his recent large-scale projects, despite his string of failures." `
`"...And we discovered... `
`that no such backer exists. `
`The iron rule of the money roulette is that you bet against the loser. `
`Aniki, you're a fairly well-known loser in this field. `
`It's true that prosperous times are about to come, but when we looked for people who considered that enough to overlook your string of failures... `
`and also had enough for the investment, `
`we found no candidates." `
`"So, `
`the big question now... `
`is where you got that money from." `
`".........Hoh. `
`Now isn't this intriguing. `
`And?" `
`"D-Dear! `
`How long do you plan to let these ridiculous remarks stand?!!" `
`"Sit down, Natsuhi-san. `
`Let's cut to the point. `
`Aniki, you've been diverting Dad's private funds for your own businesses. `
`There's pretty much no room for doubt. `
`If you think we've made some kind of mistake, please, feel free to explain." `
`"Rudolf, don't call it diverting funds. `
`This is embezzlement, plain and simple. `
`A huge crime that can be criminally prosecuted." `
`"Th-This sort of rudeness cannot be tolerated!! `
`How can you face the Successor to the Ushiromiya Head Family and level these absurd accusations?!!" `
`"They aren't absurd, they're right on the mark. `
`I'm sure he'd like to somehow make his business succeed and recover his losses, but his debt keeps getting bigger! `
`He's just trying to cover up the failure of one gamble by making an even bigger one. `
`It's only natural that he'd try to grab any source of funding close at hand! `
`Let me be frank. Nii-san, what you're doing is embezzlement. `
`You're betraying Father. `
`You know that we'll have the courts settle this after it's all over, right? `
`Do you think that kind of person has any right to call themselves the Successor to the Ushiromiya Head Family?" `
`"O-Of all the... Y-You dare to claim that he has betrayed the Family Head?!! `
`You no longer have the right to straddle the threshold of the glorious Ushiromiya family!! `
`Leave this place at once!! `
`Now!! `
`Get out!!" `
`Natsuhi, who had already reached the limits of her anger, shouted at Eva in a rage. `
`She then pointed alternately at Eva and the hallway, demanding that she leave. `
`Eva took out a folding fan and fanned herself with it, glaring maliciously at Natsuhi as though silently daring her to repeat what she'd said. `
`However, her mouth was still smiling, curved in the shape of a crescent moon. `
`...In that unpleasant silence, Rosa gulped. `
`"Hey, ...Natsuhi nee-san? `
`To whom do you think you are speaking in such a tone?" `
`"I'm speaking to the exceedingly rude sister of my husband!! `
`As the person in charge of family affairs, I cannot overlook any more of this!!" `
`"In charge of the affairs? `
`Huhuhu, `
`hahahaha, `
`ahhahahahaha!! `
`Be silent, `
`lowly maidservant!" `
`Eva folded the fan with a snap and rose to her feet energetically. `
`Compared to the elegance and playfulness she'd shown until a second ago, she was now unimaginably aggressive. `
`"How foolish. You stand down!! `
`Before Eva of the Ushiromiya family!" `
`"You tell me to stand down? Me, Ushiromiya Eva, the third ranked in the Ushiromiya family hierarchy and the one allowed to sit at the left shoulder of the Head?!! `
`Know your place!! `
`And then look at your shabby self in a mirror!! `
`Where is the symbol of the wing on your clothes? `
`Where are you permitted to wear the One-Winged Eagle? `
`Aren't you nothing more than a borrowed womb to house the next Successor to the Ushiromiya family?!! `
`Understand your place, you common housemaid!!" `
`Eva's face twisted hideously as her words gouged into Natsuhi's heart like talons, wrenching at it. `
`"........................!!!" `
`There were a hundred ways Natsuhi wanted to respond. `
`However, her anger and sorrow crushed her throat...and none of those words managed to make it to her mouth. `
`...Her anger had nowhere to go...and became a single hot tear that slowly dripped down... `
`"What's wrong? `
`If you have something to say, please do so. `
`Come on." `
`Eva faced her with a provocative gaze. `
`......However, Natsuhi could do nothing but tremble, her clenched fists quivering... `
`Krauss quietly broke that powder-keg tension. `
`"Natsuhi, `
`leave your seat. `
`You should go cool your head." `
`"Wha...!!" `
`Natsuhi, resenting the fact that her husband had not come to her aid, shifted the focus of her attack. `
`"D-Dear, don't you understand what they're saying about you?! `
`These people are baselessly calling you a traitor to Father!! `
`They are making light of the fact that we protect the glory of the Ushiromiya family, even though we are constantly expending every effort to earn that glory from Father. `
`They trample all of that underfoot with their hateful rambling!!! `
`And you don't even try to fight back! Why?! `
`I'm only standing up for us because you won't, but you've been putting the entire burden on me for some time now!! `
`And now you tell me to go cool my head?! `
`It's always me!!" `
`"Even though I have always considered this family's affairs so seriously, you've...!! `
`Aaaaaaaahhh, gaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!" `
`Natsuhi was already unable to hide her tears. `
`She flew from the room in that state. `
`After that, all that remained was a somewhat embarrassed mood about the parlor... `
`When the sound of footsteps grew distant and silence returned, Krauss shrugged his shoulders slightly. `
`"...I apologize for my wife. `
`She has always been bad at controlling her emotions. `
`It's even been rough for me." `
`"If that's what's been managing your household, you must suffer to no end, Nii-san. `
`*giggle*giggle*...!" `
`"Aaaaaaahhh. `
`Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!" `
`"...M-Madam......" `
`"It's nothing...! `
`Leave me be...!!" `
`Natsuhi flew into her room and threw herself onto her bed, lamenting... `
`Those heartwrenching sobs reached Kumasawa in the hallway... `
`......Poor Madam Natsuhi... `
`There is a deep enmity between her and Eva-sama. `
`Explaining their relationship would be very trying for me, as a woman... `
`The Ushiromiya family holds blood in high regard, but if a woman marries and leaves the family, they are normally removed from the family register. `
`...Thus, under normal circumstances, Eva-sama should have been removed when she married Hideyoshi-sama. `
`However, `
`...there is no one deserving of blame in this matter. `
`The Madam certainly bears no guilt. `
`There nothing to call it other than a whim of God. `
`...Krauss-sama and Natsuhi-sama were not blessed with children for some time. `
`After all, this is the male-dominant Ushiromiya family. `
`A wife is merely a tool to create a heir. `
`...If such a wife cannot fulfill her only duty, she will not even be treated as a human. `
`It pains me to remember how the Master tortured Madam during that time... `
`Back then, a wedding between Eva-sama and Hideyoshi-sama was being discussed. `
`Eva-sama was sly. `
`...Taking advantage of Madam's inability to become pregnant, she gained the favor of the Master. `
`She inspired him to allow her to marry and give birth to a Successor herself, making sure to avoid transferring her name out of the Ushiromiya register. `
`There was a vast difference in the Ushiromiya hierarchy between Madam, who married into the Ushiromiya family and was treated like an outsider, and Eva-sama, who was related to the family by blood and whose husband took on the Ushiromiya name. `
`Furthermore, Eva-sama actually gave birth first, and to a boy... `
`As for how much weaker Madam's position was than Eva-sama's...well, I believe you could see for yourself... `
`...I'm sure Madam is tormented by the thought that, if only she had gotten pregnant earlier, the Master wouldn't have accepted Eva-sama's request to keep her last name after marriage, and Eva-sama wouldn't have been permitted to act as arrogantly as she did today... `
`However, ...that was not Madam's fault...... `
`All of the blame lies with God's whims and the stork that delivered Jessica late...... `
`Even so, Madam won't allow herself to see things this way... `
`......She probably can't help but cry bitter tears as a woman...at her inability to carry out the duties expected of a wife... `
`Ahh, how sad... `
`I cannot do anything except watch over her from the shadows...... `
