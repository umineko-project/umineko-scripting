`"...What sort of tea should I prepare next? `
`You have free choice of any brand that ever was throughout the ages." `
`"...Dried plum black tea. `
`...The kind that goes for 200 yen a pack." `
`"*cackle*cackle*...! `
`...For a thousand years, I have been fond of black tea, but I did not know of such a thing. `
`...I will never tire of living in this world." `
`"......Beato, `
`you don't have to display such hostility. `
`...I am just a wandering witch. `
`I didn't come with the intention of violating the rules of your territory." `
`"...*cackle*cackle* Hostility? I bear nothing of the sort. `
`...I am just terribly concerned with seeing to it that the legendary witch, Lady Bernkastel, is well attended to." `
`"...You misunderstand. `
`I am powerless. `
`Before a witch such as you, who possesses the dreadful power to kill an individual a hundred times, I am completely powerless." `
`"That a powerless Lady Witch like you possesses a power that none can approach is what is truly terrifying. `
`After all, that Great Witch, Lady Lambdadelta, was dethroned by you alone." `
`"...I only won an endurance contest. `
`She simply got tired." `
`"That is not what Lady Lambdadelta said though. `
`...*cackle*cackle*cackle* Too much humility can be unseemly, Lady Bernkastel." `
`"...That girl has a dreadful power. `
`...The power to kill an individual 'without fail'. `
`However, 'without fail' doesn't exist in this world. `
`No matter how many times you divide one, you can never reach zero. `
`That girl has the power to bring the odds of failure down to 'almost exactly zero', ...the power to give rise to 'almost perfect certainty'. `
`...I hope I never have to fight such a terrifying witch again." `
`"However, you have the power to cause success without fail, 'as long as the odds are not zero'. `
`...Though you say 'without fail' doesn't exist in this world, you possess an infallible power yourself. `
`...How very terrifying, *cackle*cackle*...!" `
`"...The power to kill an individual 'endlessly'... `
`...I think you're the more terrifying one." `
`"You jest. `
`...From your point of view, mine is but a trifling power. `
`This is most certainly what one would call empty praise." `
`"...Call it flattery to make up for the cost of staying here. `
`...I am a fleeing traveler who crosses the Fragments, continually running from boredom. `
`...I simply came around because I heard you'd started something interesting. `
`Have no doubts that I will choose to leave as soon as you are no longer interesting." `
`"*cackle*cackle*...! `
`I, Beatrice, am deeply and humbly delighted to have the great Lady Bernkastel as an observer. `
`*cackle*cackle*! `
`And so, your impressions?" `
`"...Lambdadelta is terrifying because of her cruelty, but she's a girl I can understand. `
`...You do seem to be capable of affection, but I can't understand you at all. `
`That makes you much more terrifying than her." `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...! `
`I am fickle by nature. `
`Do forgive me. `
`...Besides, I believe you also enjoy entrusting your fate to the roll of fickle dice, right, Lady Bernkastel?" `
`"...When I roll the dice, I have a roll I clearly want to get. `
`Unlike you. `
`You, on the other hand, never let the dice fall from your hand. `
`So, whatever the roll might have been, you're never disappointed. `
`Whatever roll the dice show you, you are satisfied 'without fail'. `
`...In that sense, you far surpass me." `
`"...You're one I really don't want to fight with. `
`Inside of you, there's nothing but zero. `
`That's why I can't win against you with my power. `
`...It's the worst compatibility. `
`...Perhaps Lambdadelta, on the other hand, has a good compatibility against you. `
`Since she would be able to kill your 'endless' nature." `
`"*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*! `
`...Oh yes, witches truly are the best people to enjoy black tea with. `
`One doesn't get bored. `
`*cackle*cackle*!" `
`"...Then, I'm relieved. `
`Boredom is the only poison that can kill me. `
`...So, don't kill me, okay? `
`Lady Beatrice, Endless Witch." `
`"If such is your wish, I, Beatrice, shall show you an even better time. `
`...In that case, wouldn't it be best if I brought the next chessboard in right away? `
`It seems the next tale would do more for you than another cup of black tea." `
`"..............." `
`"Just wait for a moment. `
`...*cackle*cackle*!" `
`...Something troublesome seems to have taken a liking to you. `
`I'd really like to lend you my power, but as you just heard, that girl's power and mine have a very bad compatibility. `
`Unfortunate as that may be. `
`But you really are pitiful, so I'll help you out just a bit. `
`First of all, about that girl. `
`She does have the name Beatrice, but that doesn't necessarily mean she is 'one individual woman'. `
`Get what I mean? `
`In other words, she's not some Human. `
`Her existence is a personification of the rules of this world. `
`To beat her, you have to expose the rules of this world and unravel them. `
`Perhaps this can be likened to learning the rules of chess by watching a game. `
`First, take a good look at the chessboard. `
`Then, learn the movements and roles of the pieces. `
`Then, look for the conditions required to win at her game. `
`When you've managed to reveal all these things, her heart will be exposed. `
`After that, you can rip it apart or crush it as you please. `
`...I am being quite generous. `
`In the past, when I had a human body, it took me a hundred years to notice even this much. `
`This is my meager farewell gift to you, the pitiful one captured by Beato. It's just like a spoon. `
`A spoon can be used for more than just drinking soup. `
`You can use it to dig through the prison you're locked in, or as a weapon to gouge the witch's eyes out. `
`...Of course, you can also use the spoon to continually sip the watery soup inside your eternal cell. `
`...Don't get the wrong idea. I have no intention of becoming your ally. `
`I do feel empathy for you, but I won't help you. `
`...It's like I'm sitting in front of the television yelling at you on the other side, even though my voice won't reach you. `
`{a:c: `
`SO, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I AM A WITCH, RIGHT?} `
`I intend to enjoy this endless tale that Beato is going to weave until I tire of it. `
`But that alone won't hold my interest. `
`...That's why I'll lend you my power. `
`It's all so that I don't get tired of this. `
`I am the cruelest witch in the world. `
`Whoever the opponent may be, I'll make them surrender with certainty. `
`...Even if it's Beatrice, the Endless Witch, okay...? `
`You are my game piece. `
`Give it your best shot. `
`I'll give you advice sometimes, out of her sight. `
`Don't bore me, okay...? `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*... `
