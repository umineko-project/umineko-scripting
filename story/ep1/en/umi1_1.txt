`".........Should've taken the boat...`
`......the boat......"`
`"Gonna faaalll!`
` Gonna faaalll!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Maria, that's enough!"`
`"......But what a surprise.`
` I thought there was nothing that could scare Battler‐kun."`
`"This guy can't handle vehicles for some reason.`
` Always yells about falling and sinking and stuff.`
` You're a disgrace of a man, you are."`
`"......Urgh, shut up.`
` That thing was seriously shaking way too much...`
` I just got a little stressed, since it was my first time on a small plane like that..."`
`"You call that "a little stressed"?`
` Heheheh, sounds like it'd be fun to take an overseas vacation with you, Battler‐kun.`
` Would you like to go to Egypt with your aunt?`
` You'd get to ride a plane for a full 14 hours!"`
`"Ahhahaha!`
` There's a good plan.`
` Battler‐kun, you should go let Eva nee‐san toughen you up some.`
` But boy were you hilarious!`
` Ahhahahaha!"`
`"Wahhahaha, now, now. Everyone's got their own strong and weak points.`
` It's bad to laugh at 'em.`
` Wahhahaha...!"`
`"D‐Dad, you're laughing too.`
` Hey, Maria‐chan, you shouldn't laugh anymore."`
`"Shouldn't laugh anymore?`
` Uu!"`
`Gyah, dammit!`
` Is being scared of planes really such a big deal?`
`{n}Everyone obviously thinks I'm a big oaf now...`
` Tch!`
`We split up and took separate taxis from the airport to the harbor.`
`{n}From there on, we would be taking a boat to the island.`
`The islands are right next to each other, so it's not that far.`
`{n}It would be a leisurely thirty minutes by boat.`
`As we arrived at the pier where the boat to the island was anchored, we saw a silhouette waving its hand.`
`"George nii‐saaan!`
` It's been so frickin' long!!"`
`"Ah, Jessica‐chan, it's been a year since I saw you!`
` You've gotten taller again, haven't you?"`
`"Kyahaha, don't gimme that, it's embarrassing hearing that every year!"`
`"......H‐hey, Aniki, you've gotta be kidding me.`
` That's really Jessica?!"`
`"Wait a sec, George nii‐san...`
` This massive beast...`
`is Battler?!"`
`We both stared each other down.`
`...She definitely didn't look this grown‐up in my memories, but I do remember her {c:86EF9C:crazy way of talking}.`
`"Yo, Jessica!`
` What's this now!`
` You're kidding me, you look like a woman now!`
` What're these, boobs? Even you managed to get a chest!`
` Ihihi, let me rub 'em, let me~!"`
`"Hey, screw you, I'm a blushing flower of 18!`
` Just like hair grows out, so'll other stuff!`
` You think I got boobs just so you can go and rub 'em, loser?!`
` And what about you, got anything to back up that ridiculous size?!`
` Did you remember to grow any actual muscle?!"`
`"You'd better believe it, I'll show you how much training I've piled up since back then!!"`
`"Oh, cram it!!`
` I'll beat you at your own game!"`
`This headstrong girl's name is Ushiromiya {p:0:朱志香}.`
`......She was born under the same unlucky star as me, sharing the same kind of weird name.`
` You see, {p:0:朱志香} is pronounced "Jessica".`
`She's Dad's older brother's daughter.`
`That older brother happens to be the eldest son of the Ushiromiya family, so I guess that also technically makes Jessica a direct heir to the Ushiromiya family.`
`Since Jessica and I are the same age and had that type of boy‐girl rivalry between us,`
` we've always been used to fighting and joking around together whenever the relatives gathered.`
`Jessica grew more quickly, so she always had me beat in terms of size and physical strength.`
`So, when we scuffled as a contest of strength like this, it usually went Jessica's way.`
`So even though I clearly understand that I'm bigger now, I still feel like I can't win against Jessica with my strength.`
`"Hnng! Ghhh......!!"`
`"............Woh...ah...!`
` What the...what're you...getting all serious for...?!`
` Owowow..."`
`"Hey hey hey, this is nothin'!`
` Jessica, you've gotten weak."`
`"Sh‐shut up.`
` I'm a woman over here, believe it or not.`
` No way I was always gonna be stronger than a man!"`
`"We~ll, that's certainly true!`
` The meat I put on my arms all went to your chest, after a~ll.`
` It looks like it'd be a pretty even test of strength between my arms and your boobs, don't you thi~nk?!"`
`"I told you, my boobs aren't for you to feel up!!`
` Besides, how 'bout you—your height says you're an adult, but what about your other places, huh?!"`
`"Stop it, idiot, nooo, I'll be ruuuuined for marriage, don't touch me in strange placeees!!"`
`"D‐don't say stuff people are gonna misinterpret!!"`
`Honestly, I was so surprised at how feminine Jessica had become that I had to seriously horse around to hide it.`
`......Well yeah, considering what a bossy brat she was six years ago, anyone would be surprised.`
`And I guess she's just as surprised.`
`{n}She definitely wasn't expecting she'd lose to me in a test of strength.`
`After losing that easily, she must be shocked at how much I've grown in the past six years.`
`.........Six years.`
` Once again, I'm being shown just what a huge gap of time that was.`
`"Crap...total defeat.`
` It's like I'm no match for you anymore."`
`"That's not true.`
` Even Battler‐kun must have his weaknesses.`
` Right, Maria‐chan?"`
`"Uu!`
` Gonna faaall gonna faaall!!"`
`"Ghhk—Don't—Maria~, let's keep that a secret, okay?"`
`"Faaall?`
` What the hell's that?"`
`"Heheh!`
` Sorry, but you won't be seeing that weakness of mine now!`
` After all, the nightmare plane trip is already over and done with!`
` Only thing left is the nice, quiet splashing of the boat trip.`
` I never thought I'd become so fond of that piece‐a‐junk boat.`
` Ihihihi!"`
`"Huh???`
` George nii‐san, is there something wrong with his head?"`
`"You'll understand soon.`
` Very soon."`
`At the time, I didn't understand what Aniki meant by that big smile...`
`"What have we here......oooh!`
` Battler‐san, how big you've grown...!"`
`Who's it this time?`
` It's an old lady with an apron.`
`{n}.........Oh, oh yeah, that takes me back...I remember now!`
`"Remember her, Battler‐kun?`
` You remember—she's Kumasawa‐san, one of the servants."`
`"I could never forget Kumasawa baa‐chan!`
` I mean, you haven't aged a bit in these past six years.`
` Wait, you haven't gotten younger, have you~?"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho!`
` Lately, my skin has been getting all smooth and silky!`
` And look, hasn't my chest gotten even bigger as well?`
` ...Want to give it a rub?"`
`"V‐very funny!`
` My breast rubbing is strictly limited to bouncy girls!"`
`"Even I had some bouncy ones in my youth, you know~?`
` Now, now, please feel free to have a go!"`
`"Gyah, gimme a break!`
` It's chicks I'm looking for, dammit!`
` Not grannies!"`
`The jokes I'd cracked about Jessica were being used against me.`
` Come to think of it, she always was the type to tease people!`
`"Kumasawa‐san, stop that now.`
` People with one foot in the coffin shouldn't jump around."`
`"To sport with the young is the best rejuvenation medicine.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐ho!"`
`"It's rare for you to come pick us up, Kumasawa‐san.`
` What curious turn of events is this?`
` Normally whenever you're entrusted with something to do, your lumbago always kicks in.`
` *snicker*."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, Eva‐sama, you are harsh as usual.`
` I found myself with some urgent purchases to make, and while I was at it, I thought I would come welcome you all.`
` Although, it does give a bad impression if the one waiting to greet you is a decrepit old woman.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐ho...!"`
`Auntie Eva spoke sarcastically, but Kumasawa baa‐chan's years of experience were nothing to sneeze at.`
` She was more than capable of smoothly and coolly letting that comment slide.`
`Well, I'd rather not say it, but old Kumasawa baa‐chan may be past her prime as a servant.`
`She might act as though she's in good health, but between her headaches and the lumbago, her body is wearing out.`
` To tell the truth, the very fact that she's still working is impressive.`
`...How old is she this year again?`
`{n}She must be pushing eighty by now.`
`{n}It's incredible that she's still able to act so brightly.`
`"You just seem to get more and more lively.`
` Oh, that's right, here you are.`
` It's the tea I was talking about before.`
` Look, I bought some.`
` Please do try it later on."`
`Auntie Rosa showed her the souvenir bag she'd taken out of her suitcase.`
`To think that she had remembered the promise that she had apparently made last year and faithfully bought it.`
` ...This sort of thoughtfulness was just like Auntie Rosa.`
`She wasn't the kind of person who would forget or break a promise.`
`As for Kumasawa baa‐chan, she seemed deeply touched by the fact that not only had Auntie Rosa remembered that year‐old promise, she had brought that gift for a simple servant like her.`
`This woman is Kumasawa Chiyo‐san ({p:0:熊沢 チヨ}).`
`She's a senior servant who's been working for the Ushiromiya head house for many years.`
`{n}As you could expect from someone her age, she isn't that good at manual labor, but from kitchen work to cleaning and laundry, she's a kind of super servant who can handle just about anything.`
`It seems like her only flaw is a tendency to slack off.`
`I hear she tries to get away from heavy or troublesome work by playing up her chronic diseases.`
`......In Kumasawa baa‐chan's case, maybe we should call that a sort of lazy craftiness.`
`...Though it probably doesn't impress those paying her salary.`
`Ah well, even if she's pretty flaky when it comes to work, I could never dislike her.`
`I guess that's probably because of her cheerfulness and her constant smile.`
`"Hey, glad to see you're still in fine spirits!`
` How's your back doin' then?"`
`"Even with the medicine, it's not getting one whit better.`
` According to the doctor, nothing can be done for this one.`
` It's what's called an incurable disease, hoh‐hoh‐ho!"`
`"Blows me away how you've just kept getting prettier, Jessica‐chan.`
` Be glad you ended up like Natsuhi nee‐san."`
`"R‐really...?`
` Personally, I don't think I look like her at all...`
` I mean, I don't even want to be like my parents.`
` 'Cause I got zero respect for 'em."`
`"Now, you shouldn't say such things.`
` *giggle*, it's amazing how many people don't want to be like their parents in our family."`
`"Ah, that's me!"`
`"Hell no, don't you dare start taking after me.`
` Your nose looking like mine already pisses me off."`
`"What are you talking about?`
` It's ridiculous how completely alike you are—and like your father."`
`"Come on, you can't be serious...`
` Just how am I like Dad?"`
`"You're his copy in arrogance and self‐importance.`
` Father's blood is especially strong in you and Nii‐san.`
` Wouldn't you say, Rosa?"`
`"Oh, absolutely.`
` Krauss nii‐san and Rudolf nii‐san are almost unbelievably like Dad."`
`"Alright, alright already, why am I the only one under fire from the girls?`
` Hideyoshi nii‐san, please help me out."`
`"My my, Rudolf‐kun, you're always so popular with the ladies.`
` I'm jealous!`
` Wahahahaha!"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho!`
` As usual, you're popular enough to make me jealous.`
` Well then, everyone, shall we head over to the boat?`
` Come now, Maria‐san, let's get on the boat together, alright?"`
`"Get on the boat together.`
` Uu!`
` Everyone gets on together.`
` Uu!"`
`"Hell yeah, this time around I'm not gonna be scared.`
` I'm used to being shaken by the waves.`
` With that piece‐a‐junk fishing boat, I'm less afraid of the shaking than the engine breaking down and the boat drifting off."`
`"Oh yes, Battler‐kun, I forgot to tell you.`
` ...That fishing boat was completely decrepit, so it was taken out of use a few years back.`
` Now we get taken to the island in another boat."`
`"Ohhh, right.`
` It's Battler's first time in the new boat!`
` It's super comfy!`
` And frickin' fast!`
` It can go at crazy high speeds!"`
`"Ohhh...`
` That means less trip time, right?`
` That sounds great!`
` I mean, a boat might be better than an airplane, but if you're telling me we can spend even a little less time exposed to the danger of sinking, that's really just awesomely great~."`
`"...Uu.`
` Is Battler gonna faaall gonna faaall again?"`
`"That's only on airplanes.`
` Everything's fine now!"`
`"You know, it's apparently a modded high‐speed boat, the captain's pride and joy!`
` Seems he's tinkered with it quite a lot—`
`he was going on about how he attached four high efficiency propellers to it, and now it can break 40 knots, or something like that.`
` He bragged to me so much I ended up memorizing it."`
`"Me too; I remember since we're told about it every year.`
` The captain said that since he lost a speed contest with a foreign fishing boat a long time ago, he became obsessed with modding.`
` He told us how his opponent back then could go at over 30 knots, even though it was only in a fishing boat."`
`"To fulfill his thirst for a revenge match, he created an awesome whole new super high‐speed modded boat.`
` I'm sure you'll just love it, Battler."`
`...S‐super high‐speed modded boat...?`
`......My first thought was that this would be much better than some beat‐up boat that might sink at any time......`
`but for some reason, I'm getting this feeling of foreboding...`
` ......Nah.`
`"Hey, Battler, maybe you should just swim to the island."`
`"Battler‐kun, you shouldn't lean over the railing too much.`
` You might fall."`
`"Uu‐uu!!`
` Gonna faaall gonna faaall!!"`
`"Daaaaammiiiiit...so this is why you were all grinning before!"`
`The super high‐speed boat, said to have been modded to hell and back by its captain as a personal hobby, was definitely nothing like the battered old fishing boat from six years ago.`
`"Whooooooooa, it's shaking it's shaking it's shaking!!`
` I'm gonna fall gonna fall gonna fall!!"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Gonna fall gonna fall gonna fall!!"`
`"If I fall I'll be in the sea, I'll drown goddammit—where's the parachute—no, wait—where's the buoy?!`
` Gimme a life jackeeeet!!"`
`"Waah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!`
` What the hell, Battler, what's that supposed to be...waah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!"`
`"Jessica‐chan, Maria‐chan, it's not nice to tease.`
` Battler‐kun, if you're scared, then just don't come out on the deck.`
` I think that if you stay inside the boat, you'll be a bit less afraid."`
`"Heheh, that's a no‐thank‐you, Aniki!`
` Shipwreck victims are always the ones inside the boat.`
` The survivors are usually those on the deck during the accident.`
` So I'm staying right here!!"`
`"But, it's shakiiiiing!!`
` I'm falliiing!!`
` Whooooaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"Shaking falliing!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Maria, I told you to behave yourself!`
` ......But Battler‐kun, it looks like you really can't handle it...`
` I'll go tell the captain to slow down for you."`
`"Whooooa, Auntie Rosa, thank yooooouuuuu!`
` Even on the sea, exercise safe driving, reduce speeds, point and caaaall!!"`
`"*cackle*!`
` Don't do that, Rosa.`
` Ordeals are necessary for the young.`
` Right, Battler‐kun?`
` You can conquer this much, no problem at all, right?`
` Otherwise, you won't be able to go to Egypt with your aunt!"`
`"Whooooa, Auntie Eva, you're meeeeeeeeaaaan!`
` Ooh noooo, I'm gonna faaaaaall!!`
` Life jackeeeet, parachuuuute!!`
` Whoooooooaaaaaaahh......!!!"`
`"N‐no, okay, turn it over and think that way!!`
` What's the enemy aiming for?!`
` He wants to make me afraid like this?!`
` If that's what he's aiming for, too bad, like hell I'll be scaaaaaaaared!!`
` But stooopp iiit, I'm gonna faaaaaaall!!!"`
`...So, after I made a huge fool of myself for a while,`
` Auntie Rosa had a talk with the boat captain, and he slowed down to a more manageable speed for me...`
`"............Hahh...`
` This speed is a bit better...`
` .........Earlier, I didn't even feel alive......"`
`The new speed, which I was capable of tolerating, was apparently extremely slow.`
`...But that just now was completely insane...`
`The whole boat was shaking!`
`{n}Sliding and leaping on the ocean's surface!`
`{n}It felt like I was riding on the back of a flying fish...`
`Jessica was still guffawing at me as I leaned against the railing, tired and disheartened.`
`"I lost in that strength contest earlier, but I'm glad to know I've got the edge where it really counts.`
` But seriously, pfffahahahahah!"`
`"Dammit...go ahead and laugh.`
` One of these days, I'm gonna find your weakness and I'll get back at you...and then your boobs will be mine to squish......"`
`"Ahahaha, well, we'll see about that if you ever do find it, okay?!`
` Waah‐hah‐hah‐ha!"`
`"Uu.`
` Battler, all worn out."`
`"Yeah, Battler, all worn out...`
` I want to die on land, not in the ocean or the sky..."`
`Maria was patting my back, so I patted her head in return.`
`...Her expression was blank, as usual, but I realized that she wanted to console me.`
`"Battler‐kun, the captain is throwing in drinks to make up for this.`
` Have a drink and take a break, why don't you?`
` To calm yourself down."`
`George‐aniki and Kumasawa baa‐chan brought us each an ice‐cold drink with drops of moisture on the can.`
`Judging from Kumasawa‐san's big grin, our parents inside the boat were probably all rolling around laughing at my moment of pure terror.`
`Dammit, I'm so embarrassed that I can't bear to face any of them...`
`If I didn't change the subject somehow, I had the feeling I'd be the butt of everyone's jokes for the whole trip, so I tried to think of something harmless to talk about.`
`"...Hey, Jessica.`
` How are Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi doing?"`
`"My old man and my mom?`
` Unfortunately, they're fine.`
` Though every other word out of their mouths is "study, study", which pisses me off.`
` I'm so jealous, 'cause it doesn't look like Uncle Hideyoshi or Uncle Rudolf say those kinds of things."`
`"Hahaha, oh no.`
` When I was slacking off during exams, I was always getting told "exams, exams".`
` I thought it was annoying, but now I'm grateful."`
`"Hah, I knew it, George‐aniki is magnanimous as ever...`
` As for me, I have to look after myself.`
` No one says a thing to me!`
` Well, it's not like I'd listen if they did, hihihi!"`
`"Battler‐san, have you still not returned to your birth home?"`
`"...Well, I kinda go back now and then.`
` I still have lots of clothes and stuff left at the previous house."`
`"......Uu?`
` Battler has two homes?"`
`"Uh,`
` .........hmmm.`
` ......Something like that."`
`"Why?`
` Why do you have two homes?`
` Uu?`
` Uu?"`
`Only Maria, who couldn't really grasp the situation, voiced her naive question.`
`However, the others just shot nervous glances at me, choosing not to respond even though they knew the answer.`
`"Maria!`
` Look, you can see the harbor now...!`
` Look, over there!`
` Can you see it?!"`
`"Uu!`
` Saw the harbor, saw the harbor!"`
`Apparently, Jessica was trying to be nice by changing the subject.`
`......Ah, well.`
` I'd rather not talk about it if I can help it, but it's uncomfortable to have it treated like some kind of weird taboo.`
`......I don't mind that much myself anymore.`
`I am an Ushiromiya,`
` but the truth is that, for the past six years, I've been living with my grandparents on my late mother's side, and I've even been using her family name.`
`When those grandparents passed away one after the other, I'd basically had no choice except to go back and live with the old bastard.`
`Don't get me wrong. I didn't just run away from home or anything like that.`
`{n}The only one at fault here is my dad.`
`......I don't really blame Kyrie‐san.`
`{n}Being able to hold that old bastard's reins and ride him out is no mean feat.`
`...But as for the betrayal that the old bastard inflicted on my mom...`
` ......Well, unfortunately, I still haven't fully gotten over that.`
`"*ahem*.`
` We'll be getting there soon."`
`George‐aniki cleared his throat, trying to change the topic.`
`"......Please forgive my indiscretion.`
` It seems this old woman has said too much already.`
` If I have hurt your feelings—"`
`"Heheh!`
` I don't mind it and no one's feelings are hurt.`
` Don't worry, Kumasawa baa‐chan."`
`Kumasawa‐san seemed to regret speaking out of turn,`
` but I was more concerned about being worried over for something like that, so I stood up and passed it off lightly.`
`After that, I had a sip of my drink and headed over to Maria and Jessica, who were gazing at the silhouette of the island.`
`"Uu!`
` Battler, saw the island, saw the island!`
` There there there!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!"`
`"Where is it...oh, I see it now.`
` Even after six years, the island hasn't changed a bit."`
`The small island's silhouette in front of us had gotten pretty close.`
`This island's name is Rokkenjima.`
`{n}It's a small island about ten kilometers around, located in the Izu Archipelago.`
`Since they call this archipelago "the Izu Seven", lots of people think there are seven islands, but that's not true.`
`There are actually more than seven.`
`{n}Rokkenjima is one of the minor islands that don't get counted.`
`Even considering that, there are probably very few people who know about this island.`
`After all, only the people of the Ushiromiya family come to this island.`
`In other words, it has no ties whatsoever to outsiders or tourists.`
`{n}So, you'll never find this island's name in a travel brochure.`
`This is because all of Rokkenjima is an estate possessed by the Ushiromiya head house.`
`Only the Ushiromiya family lives there, and only people connected to the Ushiromiya family come and go there.`
`There's nothing there except a harbor and a mansion.`
`{n}The vast majority of the island is still just uncultivated forest.`
`Such a waste, when it could be made into a nice golf course.`
`{n}However, when you realize that the entire coastline is a private beach, it starts to sound pretty magnificent.`
`You might have realized it by now, but to put it simply,`
` ......well, the Ushiromiya family is just rolling in dough.`
`The fortune possessed by the head house is apparently vast,`
` and Dad and the others who make up the branch families have built up plenty of wealth for themselves, finding success in their respective businesses.`
`I've been living a commoner's life at my grandparents' home these six years, so I'd completely forgotten,`
` ...but the old bastard's house really is elegant, and everything about it is tuned to match the snobbish tastes of the annoyingly rich.`
`Come to think of it, I guess that means George‐aniki, Jessica, Maria, and I are all wealthy, high‐class gentlemen and ladies.`
`Needless to say, none of us feel that way at all.`
`I don't see myself as being rich, and George‐aniki, who takes self‐discipline very seriously, doesn't let himself get too comfortable.`
`Jessica is always complaining that she'd rather move to the city than be rich,`
` and Maria is still a kid who isn't even interested in money at all.`
`...I guess that attitude itself is snobbish.`
`{n}From the perspective of people in poverty who can't pay the bills, we're very lucky to even have the luxury of thinking this way.`
`This isn't the place to explain any further, so I won't.`
`Anyway, it's the same as not being able to choose the parents you're born from.`
`{n}I didn't ask to be born into a rich family.`
`{n}And I don't think it's something I should be hated for.`
`It can be pretty trying when people are prejudiced against you just because you're rich and refuse to judge you by your merits...`
`As I pondered these sentimental thoughts, Maria leaned over the railing and started shouting.`
`"............Uu.`
` ......Gone."`
`"What's wrong, Maria?`
` Did you drop something?"`
`"Uu‐uu!`
` Gone, gone!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`Maria kept yelling "gone, gone".`
`From her words alone, you would think she had perhaps dropped something, but she was actually pointing out over the ocean as she shouted.`
`"What's wrong?`
` What's gone?`
` I'll look for it too, if you want.`
` What is it?`
` ...............?"`
`If she'd dropped something, she would probably have looked down at the floor, but Maria was pointing out over the ocean.`
`One would assume that she had seen something out over the ocean, but she kept saying that something was {i:gone}.`
` .........Strange.`
`However, since my last memories of this place came from six years ago, I was able to spot it before Aniki, who comes here every year.`
`"............Huh...?`
` ......If I remember correctly, wasn't there a {c:86EF9C:torii} or something on top of a small crag around here?`
` ...That's right, it was definitely there.`
` I remember it well, since it's like a landmark, the first thing to greet you as you get closer to the island."`
`"Wow, you're amazing, Battler.`
` Even though it's been six years, you remembered."`
`"It was here, wasn't it...!`
` I remember too.`
` There used to be a shrine and a torii‐like thing standing all alone on that crag.`
` ......And now that you mention it, they are gone, aren't they.`
` They definitely were there last year, I think."`
`"Gone.`
` Gone.`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!"`
`"Maybe they were washed away by the waves or something?`
` It was a small crag, it probably got brittle because of its exposure."`
`"I think so too.`
` It actually disappeared during the summer.`
` Apparently—"`
`"A huge lightning bolt fell one evening and smashed the shrine, or some such...`
` ......The fishermen whisper that it must undoubtedly be an ominous sign, to have a thunderbolt fall upon our tutelary god.`
` ...Lightning begone, lightning begone..."`
`Kumasawa‐san smiled impishly as if teasing us, rubbing her hands together.`
`However, Maria was apparently taking it seriously,`
` and she stared fixedly over the ocean to where the crag enshrining the local guardian deity was supposed to be.`
`"............An ominous...sign.`
` ............Uu."`
`"Enough, Kumasawa‐san.`
` Maria isn't old enough to understand this kind of joke."`
`"It's alright, Maria‐chan.`
` It's just a coincidence.`
` Nothing scary's gonna happen."`
`George‐aniki put a hand on Maria's shoulder to calm her down, but Maria's sharp‐eyed expression didn't budge.`
`"............Ominous.`
` ............Ominous."`
`Maria muttered that word over and over.`
`{n}Apparently, repeating a single word over and over is a habit that Maria's had for a long time.`
`However, since the word she was saying was quite literally ominous, it was a bit creepy.`
`"Hey now, Maria.`
` Some disaster really will come if you say that word over and over, you know?"`
`I tapped Maria's other shoulder.`
`And then, Maria whipped her head around, stared into my face, and spoke unblinkingly.`
`"Uu.`
` .........Disaster...coming."`
`"Huh?`
` And just where is it coming from?"`
`I answered light‐heartedly, trying to break the tension in the air.`
`...And in reply, Maria held up a finger, raised her arm high, ...and pointed up to the heavens.`
`When I looked up, I saw that the sky was still just as cloudy, but it had grown a great deal more leaden than it had been that morning.`
`That's right—they were saying that a typhoon was approaching.`
`...We had planned to spend one night on the island, but if this storm doesn't pass quickly, I won't be able to make it to school on Monday.`
`{n}Well, I guess it makes for a pretty good excuse to be absent.`
`".....................Uu..."`
`...She apparently sensed something ominous in this cloudy sky.`
`{n}She's been muttering for a while now.`
`Girls at Maria's age tend to be very impressionable.`
`{n}She's just about the age when many girls start to get excited about sixth senses and whether they have any psychic potential and stuff.`
`...In a way, being sensitive about things like this isn't really out of the ordinary for a kid like her.`
`"It's alright, Maria‐chan.`
` The weather might get worse around tonight, but tomorrow it'll clear up and become a pretty blue sky."`
`"Uu.`
` Pretty blue sky.........`
` .........Uu..."`
`"That's right, by tomorrow it'll be a pretty blue sky.`
` There's no rain that doesn't end, and no clouds that never clear."`
`"Uu...`
` .........Rain that doesn't end.`
` ...Clouds that never clear.`
` ..................Uu........."`
`"Sure, the typhoon's coming, but it'll be gone before you know it!`
` It's alright, Maria."`
`"...............Uu.`
` ...Uu!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`Maria started yelling "uu‐uu".`
`{n}...It looked as though she was having a tantrum because no one could understand what she was trying to say.`
`What in the world is Maria trying so desperately to warn us about?`
`Unable to understand her, we could do nothing but feel a vague sense of foreboding...`
`......I've heard that everyone can feel the supernatural, but that it weakens as you age.`
`That might mean that Maria, the youngest one of us all, still possessed some kind of sense that the rest of us had lost.`
`...I wonder if that sense is sending her a warning.`
`At that moment, Kumasawa‐san quietly opened her mouth.`
`".........Rumor has it...`
`that long ago, Rokkenjima was—"`
`"Kumasawa‐san.`
` Let's not talk about that now."`
`Just as Kumasawa‐san was about to tell some kind of story, Jessica sharply interrupted her.`
`For Jessica, this was an extremely firm reaction.`
`I wanted to push her further, just out of simple curiosity,`
` but judging by how Jessica was acting, it wasn't difficult to imagine that it would simply inflame Maria's unease further.`
`...If I did try to press her for the story, the odds were pretty good that it wouldn't be anything bright and cheery.`
`"......Hoh‐hoh‐ho, I do apologize about that...`
` ...The wind here is hard to bear for the elderly, so if you would excuse me for now..."`
`Gossipers have no reason to hang around after they've been told to stop chatting.`
`When Kumasawa‐san finally realized that she'd overstepped her bounds, she went back inside the boat.`
`After she left, Uncle Hideyoshi came along to replace her.`
`Since he'd shown up partway through, he completely failed to notice the complicated atmosphere that hung about the scene,`
` so he refreshingly and unwittingly swept that atmosphere aside.`
`So, in the end, it was his unwittingness that brightened the mood.`
`"Looks like we're almost there!`
` Alright, just a little more!`
` Took forever at the speed we went today, didn't it?`
` You all know whose fault that is!`
` Wahhahahahaha!"`
`"Aww, Uncle Hideyoshi, gimme a break already~...hahaha~!"`
`"Ahaha, keep on twisting the knife.`
` Seriously, 'cause of Battler, it's takin' fore~ver!"`
`".........Uu."`
`Maria had probably come to the conclusion that no one was going to listen to her.`
`She hung her head, wearing a fretful face.`
`As she did, George‐aniki crouched down to meet her eyes and spoke to her kindly.`
`"Maria‐chan.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of.`
` Because we're all together.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of if we're together.`
` Go ahead and say it."`
`"............Uu.`
` ...There's nothing to be afraid of...if we're together..."`
`"Yes.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of if we're together."`
`"............Uu."`
`"Yeah, George‐aniki knows what he's talking about.`
` If we're all together, there'll absolutely never be anything at all to be scared of.`
` Right, Jessica?"`
`"Yeah, no doubt about that.`
` George nii‐san always tells the truth, Maria."`
`"......Uu.`
` George onii‐chan always true."`
`"Yes.`
` I don't lie.`
` So trust me.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of if we're all together."`
`"Uu.`
` ......George onii‐chan doesn't lie.`
` I trust you.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of if we're all together.`
` .........Uu, not afraid!"`
`Maria jumped into George‐aniki's arms and hugged him tightly.`
`After Aniki patted her head, she jumped away again.`
`Her facial expression had returned so completely to normal that she looked like a totally different person from moments before.`
`{n}She was once again the ordinary Maria.`
`"Uu.`
` There's nothing to be afraid of anymore, because we're all together.`
` ...Uu‐uu."`
`"Yeah, that's it.`
` ...You look all better now.`
` You're strong, Maria, good girl!"`
`"......Uu!`
` {c:86EF9C:I'm} a good girl!"`
`"Hey now, what's goin' on here?`
` Maria‐chan didn't get seasick, did she?`
` Hm?"`
`"Hahaha, well, something like that.`
` We'll be arriving soon."`
`The harbor was already drawing near.`
