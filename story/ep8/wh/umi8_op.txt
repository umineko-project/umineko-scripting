`Two silhouettes could be seen in the chapel. `
`A big brother...and a little sister. `
`The big brother who would never return from that day 12 years in the past, and the little sister who waited all alone 12 years in the future. `
`However, the big brother knew everything, ...understood everything. `
`And the little sister knew nothing, ...understood nothing. `
`So, no matter how much time passed, the little sister remained as the girl she had been 12 years before. `
`She remained a six-year-old girl forever... `
`Her sobs into his chest finally subsided... `
`She quietly waited for his next words. `
`After patting her head gently, the big brother fished around inside his shirt pocket. `
`Then, ...he took "that" out. `
`"Are you listening, Ange? `
`Take good care of this." `
`"...What is it...? `
`...A key...?" `
`Battler took a large key attached to a necklace out of his pocket, then held it out to Ange. `
`It was large enough to cover his entire palm, `
`and little Ange probably wouldn't even be able to wrap her hand all the way around it. `
`The key glittered gold and had a beautiful, intricate design. `
`Its weight alone made it clear that this key was something very important. `
`Battler put the necklace around Ange's neck. `
`"This precious key is yours alone." `
`"What's it for...?" `
`"The time to use it will come soon. `
`When it does, you'll have to decide for yourself. `
`...Understand?" `
`...Of course, she didn't have a clue what Battler was saying. `
`But she did realize that he was telling her to take good care of this key. `
`So, Ange nodded, at least in response to that part. `
`In her hand, the key had felt heavy. `
`However, now that it was around her neck, it felt as light as an ordinary necklace. `
`How strange. `
`"Okay, let's go." `
`"Where to...?" `
`She had been sure that her brother was about to sit down. `
`After all, just a second ago, he said he'd tell her what happened on Rokkenjima on that day. `
`She'd expected him to tell her here... `
`"On that day, on that island, `
`...just what is it that happened?" `
`"I thought you were going to tell me about that, Onii-chan..." `
`"Absolutely. `
`And you'll be given the chance to listen. `
`...However, to you, it may not feel as though you're merely listening to a story." `
`"......What does that mean...?" `
`"What you really want...isn't to know what happened on that island on that day." `
`...So, ...he does understand, after all. `
`What happened on that island that day? `
`Trying to answer that question was all I was capable of, so I wished for nothing more. `
`...But, if I could... `
`I'd...want to go there. `
`To that island. `
`On that day. `
`To Rokkenjima, on that day I couldn't go... To the Ushiromiya family mansion. `
`To Mom and Dad. `
`To all the cousins, all the relatives. `
`And...everyone else. `
`I want to go back...to that island on that day. `
`So, I remain the way I was on that day. `
`My heart and soul stopped, stuck as a six-year-old's forever... `
`"...I want to go home." `
`"I know." `
`"Mom, Dad, Onii-chan. `
`Everyone. `
`...I want to go home...to where everyone is..." `
`"That's why...I've decided to invite you there." `
`"...Huh...?" `
`"Your Onii-chan is the Game Master now. `
`Only those who know everything about the game board can open it up and invite pieces in. `
`...So, I'll invite you to come to the game board." `
`"You'll...take me to Rokkenjima...on that day...?" `
`"That's right. `
`I'll invite you to the Rokkenjima of 1986." `
`"Will I `
`be able to see everyone...?" `
`"Of course." `
`"Even though...my memory is vague, ...and I can't remember anyone's face clearly...?" `
`"You'll remember soon enough. `
`...And, though it'll be a reunion after 12 years for you, `
`...it'll only have been a short gap for us. `
`...Everyone will welcome you. `
`When you finally return from the distant future, everyone will welcome you." `
`"Will I...be able to stay there forever...?" `
`This way, ...I can be with everyone forever. `
`This is the goal I'm supposed to reach... `
`"Ange, listen to me carefully." `
`But Battler spoke in an admonishing tone. `
`As though warning me that this was a dream that wouldn't be granted... `
`"The Rokkenjima family conference usually ends after a single night. `
`Because of the typhoon that day, the boat couldn't come, and it lasted two nights." `
`"So, when the typhoon passes, ...I'll have to leave the island again...?" `
`"...Not exactly. `
`That decision is yours as well, Ange." `
`"............" `
`"You'll decide that yourself." `
`...I understand, of course. `
`I don't exist on that island on that day. `
`It's a miracle just to be invited there like this. `
`Just the two days before the typhoon passes. `
`Just getting those two days to myself is already the sort of miracle that will never come again. `
`If I'm greedy enough to ask for more, that faint miracle might vanish. `
`...Even though I thought this, my young heart, which was still six years old, wasn't satisfied with such a short-lived miracle... `
`"I don't want to leave." `
`"......I know." `
`"I'll be with everyone forever. `
`I'll stay with my family. `
`Even if Onii-chan says I have to head back, ...I'll stay on Rokkenjima." `
`"You can stay or you can leave, but it's not as though one of those is "the right choice". `
`That's not how it works, Ange." `
`"...Even so, you'll let me choose...?" `
`"Yes. `
`That's what the key is for." `
`Battler touched the glittering key that hung from Ange's neck. `
`"I've...already made my decision." `
`"You don't have to decide now. `
`The time to choose will come soon. `
`...When it does, you must use your honest heart to choose how you'll use that key." `
`"............" `
`"You don't need to listen to anything your Onii-chan tells you. `
`You're free to choose your answer in any way you like. `
`......However, `
`if you're a good kid, and if you can trust your Onii-chan..." `
`"...If I can...?" `
`"Then believe everything Onii-chan says." `
`"I'll...believe all of it..." `
`"That will lead to the best choice for you. `
`Listen to your Onii-chan's words and believe everything. `
`...Can you do that?" `
`"......I don't know." `
`"That's good enough. `
`Believe whatever you want to. `
`That's also a choice you can make." `
`"...If I don't believe Onii-chan, `
`...will I wake up from this dream...?" `
`"That won't happen. `
`So don't worry." `
`For some reason, Ange was suspicious of her brother...and scared of him. `
`Her wish was to remain on that island on that day, together with her family, forever. `
`...She was afraid that, once she got her two miraculous days, `
`...her brother might tell her to be satisfied with that and return to 12 years in the future all alone. `
`"I already told you. `
`...There is no right decision. `
`You can go, or you can stay. `
`That's for you to decide. `
`And you don't need to make your decision right now." `
`"And no one will force me to make either choice...?" `
`"Of course." `
`"And Onii-chan won't tell me...to go back to the future...?" `
`"...There is a choice your Onii-chan wants you to make. `
`Even so, Onii-chan wants to respect your decision and let you reach it of your own accord, `
`regardless of what it happens to be." `
`"And I just told you. `
`I've already made my choice." `
`"And I just told you. `
`Now isn't the time to choose." `
`"When will it be time?" `
`"The key will tell you." `
`The large, gold key hung from Ange's neck. `
`Her small hand held it tightly... `
`...At that moment, she noticed a book lying on the chapel's altar. `
`The book had a lock on it and was sealed, so that it could not be read without a key. `
`Ange looked between the key hanging at her chest and the book on the altar. `
`"......Will this key unlock that book?" `
`"Don't touch that book." `
`His sudden, forceful response made Ange flinch. `
`Battler, realizing he had scared Ange, softened his expression. `
`"Come on, let's go. `
`...I'm inviting you to come back to October 4th, 1986." `
`"Okay." `
`Battler held out his hand, and Ange gripped it tightly. `
`Then, they started walking. `
`A brilliant light lay beyond the chapel's door. `
`That blinding light peeked in through the cracks around the door. `
`...The brother and sister began to walk through to the other side... `
`{a:c: `
`Welcome back, Ange. `
`This will be the last time.} `
`{a:c: `
`I'm opening this game board one last time...for you...} `
