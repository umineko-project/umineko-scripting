`{f:5:Eva} had broken the magic circle around the key beforehand after all. `
`By the time Battler and Ange reached it, it was falling apart like the sand in an hourglass. `
`They tried punching and kicking it to make it break faster, but nothing they did hastened the process. `
`"...It looks like she broke it a while ago, `
`...but it'll probably take some time before it's gone..." `
`"Just a bit longer, I think. `
`...If we could just buy time for five minutes..." `
`Judging by the speed the magic circles were crumbling and the general appearance of the whole scene, it looked like it would be over soon. `
`However, right now, could even five minutes be considered "soon"? `
`They turned around. `
`...Beyond the bookshelf ravine...was a universe. `
`Even for Battler, who had seen Beato's fights many times over, `
`the battle between {f:5:Lambdadelta} and {f:5:Bernkastel} was so mind-defying that he couldn't think of a single word to describe it. `
`When he finally managed to find a word, it was "a universe". `
`Each time a battle between {f:5:Lambdadelta} and {f:5:Bernkastel} unfolded, a universe was created between the pair of them. `
`Big Bangs would take place, universes would be created, galaxies beyond number would be born and erased, born and erased. `
`Then, just when it seemed that a Big Crunch had occurred and that the universe had met its demise, there would be another Big Bang, and another universe would be created. `
`It was like watching gods playing. `
`The two witches created and destroyed worlds over and over again, `
`almost as though two Creators were fighting to prove that their universe was the right one. `
`If you let your guard down in the slightest, ...then just watching this would steal your soul. That's how it felt. `
`"...We'll be able to get the key back any second now. `
`...Then, it'll be possible to go back to the Golden Land with the Fragment {f:5:Lambdadelta} gave us, right...?" `
`"Go back as soon as you get the key. `
`I can't leave {f:5:Lambdadelta} on her own." `
`"You're going to jump into that fight?!" `
`"I can't leave her on her own." `
`"............" `
`"Their fight may defy common sense. `
`...However, they're perfectly and evenly matched. `
`So, `
`...if anyone jumps in, even a single weak Human like me, ...something might break." `
`A perfect balance maintained by two great powers can easily break by adding even a little strength to one side. `
`However, actually rushing in there to add that little bit of strength would be literally suicidal. `
`Like a moth flying into a furnace. `
`It might burn up before it even reaches it. `
`"Once you get the key, go straight back to the Golden Land. `
`......We don't know how long they can hold out, remember?" `
`"...I can't go back alone, ...not when everyone is fighting." `
`"That's right, this is your fight. `
`So fight. `
`...I know you regret not dying with everyone else, but you've got to overcome that feeling and live in the future. `
`That's what you decided to do, right?" `
`".........!" `
`Ange had no words to respond with. `
`......Her brother and everyone else would probably die. `
`So, she wanted to die in the same place and at the same time as everyone else. `
`However, that could not be allowed, and she mustn't wish for it. `
`She had already made up her mind. `
`She had sworn...to live in the future, without turning back to look at everyone's deaths. `
`"When you get back to the Golden Land, show the key to Beato. `
`Beato will show you two doors. `
`...Then, she'll give you an easy puzzle and tell you to open one of them. `
`...That's...the last game on my game board." `
`"......Two...doors..." `
`"Of the two, one will lead you to the future. `
`...Don't worry. `
`I'm sure you won't choose the wrong one now. `
`Also, once you go through it, don't turn back until the door closes." `
`"Why can't I turn back?" `
`"When the door closes, you won't be able to see our fate anymore. `
`...In other words, we'll be shut inside the cat box." `
`"A fate inside a cat box...has endless truths." `
`"That's right. `
`We might've lost pathetically, or we might've made a miraculous comeback and survived. `
`In other words, if you, the Witch of the Future, are sent into the future without witnessing the end of our conflict, we'll still have a chance at victory." `
`"However, if you keep on looking at us, you'll see when we get annihilated. `
`That'll put the odds of our defeat at 100%. `
`So, to give us a miraculous victory, you must not turn back once you go through that door! `
`Got it?!!" `
`"...Y-Yeah..." `
`"So, I'll go and help {f:5:Lambdadelta}. `
`If you go back to the Golden Land after seeing me walk off like a hero, that's how my story will end for you." `
`"...The end of your battle will be sealed in the cat box. `
`...So, you certainly won't "lose"." `
`"Exactly. `
`So don't look back. `
`You'll have the key soon. `
`You've got to go back to the Golden Land like your life depends on it. `
`...So, real quick, I have one message for the "you" of the future. `
`Don't forget it, and engrave it into your heart!" `
`"Okay, ......okay...!!" `
`"...No matter what happens, never abandon the hopes that keep you alive. `
`All of us are always behind you. `
`...If you just believe, we can even speak to you! `
`Believe it! `
`If one thing is certain, it's that miracles happen when you believe!" `
`At that moment, {f:5:Lambdadelta} and {f:5:Bernkastel} were wrapped in a massive explosion. `
`Surely, one of them had delivered a powerful blow. `
`There were no further explosions, ...so that strike must have decided the match... `
`When the smoke clears, ...who will be left standing...? `
`The magic circle sealing the key still needed several minutes to dissolve... `
`"......Are you...still there...? `
`My beloved...{f:5:Lambdadelta}...?" `
`All that came into sight...was {f:5:Bernkastel}. `
`There was no answering voice from {f:5:Lambdadelta}. `
`If this was a sign of her victory, it did not cause {f:5:Bernkastel}'s expression to grow any brighter. `
`"......Too bad, Lambda. `
`...And I thought we'd be able to build a universe together. `
`...It's too bad, really too bad." `
`...{f:5:Bernkastel} was still focusing all her nerves on the battle. `
`So, she took no notice of Battler and Ange by the key. `
`...However, she would probably notice soon. `
`And then, there would be nowhere to run. `
`The last section of the magic circle was starting to fade away. `
`However, almost cruelly, the final circle went slower than the rest... `
`Seeing that, any hopes that it would dissolve in a minute, or maybe a few dozen seconds, `
`...were crushed absolutely. `
`Battler readied himself. `
`"...Well, this fight probably won't work out as well as the last one, `
`...but it looks like I'm up now." `
`"Onii-chan..." `
`"You're great, Ange. `
`I'm proud that you didn't try to stop me." `
`With tears still pouring down her face, ...Ange lovingly rubbed her cheek against the hand that had been patting her head. `
`"......I've got to gather the kitties again. `
`...I thought Battler would be with her, but I don't see him for some reason. `
`...After all, one guy like him would be about as annoying as a pebble in my shoe." `
`The smoke cleared completely, ...and they saw a huge cloud of candy bits floating around, ...like it was {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s corpse. `
`A star-shaped cookie bounced off of {f:5:Bernkastel}'s head. `
`It was missing one of its points, giving it a lonely feeling. `
`"......{f:5:Lambdadelta}. `
`...Live with me. `
`...We'll become a single universe, with you inside me." `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} chewed the cookie...and swallowed it. `
`"This way, we'll always be together...... `
`I love you, Lambda." `
`{a:c: `
`"Me too, Bern."} `
`{f:5:Bernkastel}'s stomach suddenly swelled like a balloon. `
`The bulge rose from her stomach to her throat, then exploded like a firework from her mouth. `
`From {f:5:Bernkastel}'s mouth spewed fireworks, sparks, fragments of candy. `
`"You really should fix those habits you've had since you were a cat. `
`......Here's a hint: if you find a piece of candy lying on the ground somewhere, don't pick it up and eat it." `
`"Lam...gugaaah, dah, ggaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!" `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} doubled over even more, still spitting up an exploding firework. `
`The birth of a small universe from that sweet had hit her directly from the inside of her stomach. `
`Even {f:5:Bernkastel} couldn't withstand that. `
`As {f:5:Bernkastel} repeatedly vomited fireworks so violently that it seemed her guts would spill out, her body flickered in and out of existence, and she glared at {f:5:Lambdadelta} with a terrifying expression. `
`Her body was flickering because she had taken so much damage that even maintaining her form was now difficult. `
`"How slovenly, Bern. `
`Your body's falling apart." `
`"*cough*, *cough*cough*, uuuggghhh, ...Lambdaaaaaaaaaaaa, *cough*!!" `
`"I sort of felt like losing for a bit. `
`......But I changed my mind. `
`If I became a single universe with you, `
`you wouldn't whisper to me of your love anymore." `
`"......True. `
`...I'm not the type to give food to a fish I've already caught." `
`"I know. `
`That's why you shine so beautifully. `
`...You'll lead someone on, but never actually dote on them, just like a proud queen of cats." `
`"I'll turn you into a cardboard box and make you my scratching post!!" `
`"And I'll make you a shamisen, get bored after plucking one string, then put you in a cupboard and let the dust pile up on you!!!" `
`The goat tsunami had swallowed up everything, but sea spray was still flying about. `
`The reefs resisted the ocean that was trying to cover them...and were smashing waves left and right. `
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory and the Inquisitors of Heresy specialized in close-range combat and were rapidly building a mountain of corpses. `
`The witches fought hard too, but they would have preferred to fight at a distance if they could. `
`Illusions alone wouldn't be enough. `
`In these battle conditions, all of the Humans were thrust right into the center of the fight. `
`Everyone in the Ushiromiya family displayed a fighting spirit equal to the witches and guarded their backs. `
`Even Humans are not powerless. `
`They have guns. `
`If the goats supported fantasy, they could use these as the ultimate anti-magic weapons. `
`If the goats supported mystery, they could use these in a much more obvious way. `
`Those .45 Long Colt bullets delivered fatal wounds to each and every goat they struck. `
`"Just die already!! `
`How long are you going to resist? Give up and sink, Ushiromiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!" `
`"Telling an Ushiromiya to sink makes him fight all the harder!! `
`Little girl, you have no idea what the Ushiromiya family is!!" `
`"You were dead even before 1986, weren't you?!! `
`It's about time you stopped moving, gramps!!" `
`Erika's razor-sharp scythe buried itself in Kinzo's chest. `
`It dug straight into his heart, but the daring smile on Kinzo's face didn't even falter. `
`"Hoh, ...was my death ever witnessed by anyone outside the cat box? `
`I am indestructible...indestructible!!" `
`A punch containing the entirety of Kinzo's last spark of life sent Erika flying. `
`"Father, Father, are you okay?!!" `
`"Overcome my corpse!! `
`The Ushiromiya family never turns back!!" `
`As Erika tried to deliver the finishing blow, Krauss stepped in between them, blocking the way. `
`"...I will be your opponent in Father's place." `
`"Oh? `
`If it isn't the incompetent investing expert. `
`It's pretty impressive how you managed to find all the worst bets, losing your money so quickly." `
`"And yet, even I remember to tie my shoes." `
`"Huh?" `
`Erika tried to look down at her feet, ...but what she saw was Krauss's left fist. `
`"?!?!" `
`Krauss's left uppercut made Erika float in the air. `
`Not by magic, but by the simple laws of physics. `
`For an instant, Erika saw the moon... `
`"Maybe I was incompetent as an investor!! `
`However, any of my college friends will attest to my talent as a boxer!! `
`I will not allow you to discredit every part of the Ushiromiya family, little girl!!" `
`"Y-You...damn small fry!!!" `
`"...Kanon is an illusion... `
`An illusion created by a lonely Jessica..." `
`"At the school festival, `
`I introduced Kanon-kun to everyone!! `
`Saku, and Hina, and everyone else!! `
`All of my friends can testify to that!! `
`Don't make assumptions about our relationship based on your own imagination!!" `
`Jessica's body blow made the goat's massive body cave in. `
`"Splendidly done, Milady! `
`To think that you could wield such power in a tight spot like this...!" `
`"Well of course. `
`After all, I'm thinking I don't really care if I die. `
`...This is the first time we've worked together, with you at my back. `
`Too bad it isn't cutting the cake...!" `
`Jessica laughed embarrassedly. `
`...She looked even more relaxed than she had on stage at the school festival. `
`"We have plenty to cut here besides cake." `
`"You always try to sound so cool...!" `
`"But that's what I like about you!!" `
`The massive bodies that rushed at them, trying to deny their relationship and their very existence, had two choices: be sliced or be struck. `
`Each time one of those bodies hit the floor, it became proof that the two of them existed. `
`"...Shannon is an illuuuuuuusion! `
`George is an anti-social shut-in! `
`Their love itself is an illusion and doesn't exiiiiiiist!!" `
`"George-sama, look out!!!" `
`The goat's log-sized fist buried itself in George's face. `
`This was the middle of a massive, confused battle. `
`There was no way to dodge an unexpected attack like that. `
`"......?!?!" `
`"...An anti-social shut-in, huh? `
`......Very well. `
`Say what you wish about me." `
`George had indeed been hit with a fist right to the center of his face. `
`However, he didn't bend over backwards. Not even an inch. `
`The goat started to wonder what it was he had hit. `
`Hadn't he punched a Human made of flesh...? `
`It was as though...he had slammed his fist into a steel wall, ...and it was his fist that was hurting... `
`However, ...the goat was too scared to move his fist from George's face. `
`After all, if he did, ...the expression on that face would probably be too terrifying. `
`George...pressed his hand against that fist. `
`"You probably could get testimony from my old classmates from school. `
`...Yes, I was an anti-social person. `
`...However, there's one more thing that they'll tell you, something far more important." `
`George was only grabbing the goat's massive fist in his tiny hand. `
`However, that fist was being crushed as though it had a vise around it... `
`Even though the other hand was tiny, ...the goat couldn't even move its fist. `
`"...Ushiromiya George never fought for himself, no matter what happened to him. `
`...He was a coward, who ran away from all threats. `
`...Everyone will tell you that. `
`...However, they won't tell you that he never got into a fight." `
`I accepted the fact that someone as pathetic as me would be bullied. `
`"However!! `
`Never `
`have I let anyone `
`provoke or challenge `
`anyone who treated someone as pathetic as me... `
`like a friend!!!!" `
`The goat's broken teeth flew through the air. `
`George's furious feet split the heavens. `
`"...Sh-Shannon approached George for his money, and..." `
`A goat's filthy finger touched Shannon's back. `
`That finger...exploded and boiled away. `
`"My love for George-san is true and pure. `
`...George-san must have kept all the letters I wrote him. `
`Read those, and you'll have your proof." `
`"...Y-You can write anything in a letter... `
`...The contents of a letter are no proof of true lo..." `
`A blazing red light charred the goat's entire body. `
`...Shannon slowly turned around, her face full of rage and contempt. `
`"Pitiful spectator, ignorant of love. `
`You have no right to read a mystery, much less a person's heart. `
`...Disappear...!!" `
`An absolute barrier rose up around Shannon, burning up the goats around her with its flames. `
`"Kihihihi! `
`Yeah, maybe we are dead. `
`But that doesn't give anyone the right to criticize us! `
`No one can deny the love Maria and Mama shared...!!" `
`Maria smiled, showing her teeth, and performed her job without even looking at her hands. `
`Then, she tossed the fully loaded rifle straight up into the air. `
`"......Come and get some." `
`Rosa, who stood back-to-back with Maria, caught it without turning around. `
`No, that wasn't all. `
`Maria had passed the gun to her mother perfectly without even looking back. `
`Rosa's head was pointed at the ground...as she stroked the frigid trigger with her index finger. `
`"If any of you doubt my love for my daughter, ...step forward." `
`The crowd of goats, cowed by Rosa's ferocity, ...didn't get any closer to her. `
`"Then I'll deny it. `
`...Being the serial cheater you are, you were always off playing around with some man and leaving Maria all alone!!" `
`"Nothing like that is written anywhere in Maria's diary. `
`Kihihihihi." `
`"Y-You should know better than anyone else...!! `
`Rosa didn't love you! `
`She was a crappy mother who regretted even giving birth to you!!!!" `
`Erika was peering at the unfeeling moon, ...the taste of metal in her mouth. `
`For a moment, she didn't realize what was happening. `
`Was that cold feeling on her back...the ground? `
`Huh? `
`...Why am I...lying down...? `
`And wasn't the moon full? `
`Why isn't it now...? `
`Come to think of it, ...my teeth...hurt. `
`...There's something cold...and hard there. `
`Then, she figured it out. `
`She was lying sprawled on the ground, with a gun barrel shoved into her mouth. `
`And the thing splitting the moon...was the angry king of wolves protecting its child. `
`"......Gahah......" `
`The gun barrel exploded inside her mouth, shattering her medulla oblongata. `
`...But it was only her afterimage. `
`"What a terrifying woman you are. Are you really Huma-, ......" `
`Erika, who had escaped death at the last moment by leaving an afterimage, `
`...found a metallic flash right before her eyes, which had been there even before she reappeared. `
`The fountain pen went right through Erika's eye, crushing it. `
`Of course, that was another afterimage. `
`However, when Erika escaped and reappeared somewhere else, a heel was already there waiting for her... `
`From the goats' perspective, `
`...several afterimages of Erika seemed to be appearing at once, ...all of which were pierced by Rosa at the same time... `
`"...If you say that again, I'll have to get serious." `
`"Mama's really strong, kihihihihihihihi!!" `
`"...Wh-What the hell..." `
`And so, Erika couldn't reappear anymore. `
`At the very least, not within Rosa's range of attack. `
`Erika put a lot of distance between her and Rosa, reappearing in midair. `
`"...What...are these people?! `
`What...the hell?!! `
`......?!?!" `
`Erika's animal instincts made her turn her head slightly to the side just in time. `
`Where her head used to be, there was an odd shower of sparks. `
`It wasn't magic. `
`It was a real physical phenomenon caused by lead smashing against lead. `
`To think that two bullets shot from different angles...could have flown with impossible precision at where her head once was, `
`...so that both of them hit and bounced off each other like billiard balls. `
`"...Aw, so close." `
`"Sorry about that. `
`We're big fans of the whole "take out the boss first" strategy, you see." `
`"Clay pigeons are our specialty. `
`Flying along in a straight line probably isn't a good idea." `
`The two of them spun their rifles in exactly the same way at exactly the same time, reloading them in a manner that put old westerns to shame, `
`then pointed them back up at where Erika was in the sky. `
`"...Y- `
`You monsteeeeeeeeeeeers!!" `
`Once again, their accurate shots plunged through the forehead of Erika's afterimage, bouncing off each other like billiard balls with a shower of sparks. `
`This time, Erika appeared far behind them. `
`She had to admit it. `
`She had been forced to escape to a place outside the range of those guns fired by Humans. `
`Then, the light from the moon was blocked. `
`The place she had fled to so rapidly exploded, sending chunks of rubbish flying. `
`A massive long sword had been plunged into the ground. `
`...It was Dlanor's. `
`"...Oh... `
`If it isn't my old friend...!" `
`"............" `
`She had dodged by a hair, ...but this bulky, brutal longsword was more of a cannonball shaped like a sword than something for cutting with. `
`Even though she dodged it, the blast of air pressure made her eardrums throb. `
`Dlanor was serious. `
`She seriously intended to smash Erika to bits. `
`"What's with the scary face?!! `
`Can't you try and act a bit, I don't know, cuter?!" `
`"...Do you find this {f:5:enjoyable}? `
`Destroying people's dreams and {f:5:illusions}?" `
`"Of course it's enjoyable! `
`What do you expect an intellectual rapist to do?!" `
`"You are an {f:5:evildoer}. `
`...And yet, I used to believe you were the sort of evil worthy of {f:5:sympathy}." `
`"I never asked for your sympathy." `
`"...Not cutting you down immediately upon our {f:5:meeting}... `
`That sin of mine is what brought this day to {f:5:pass}!!" `
`Dlanor's hair bristled with rage. `
`The sight this expression on one of her old friends...pinned Erika to the spot. `
`"My {f:5:friend}, `
`...allow me to free you before you can {f:5:suffer}. `
`I will not let you bear any further {f:5:sins}!!!" `
`"Whoa, ...wai-, .........!!!" `
`The force of anger that welled from Dlanor's whole body struck Erika. `
`Or rather, the swirl of blasting wind from Dlanor's massive longsword sent her flying. `
`The cannonball with a blade repeatedly cracked the ground just after Erika leapt away. `
`So, it almost looked as though Erika was jumping backwards, smashing the earth beneath her with each jump. `
`"Dlanor......" `
`"...Friend of {f:5:mine}, `
`rest in {f:5:peace}!!!" `
`The great longsword split the air again, pulverizing the ground. `
`However, this time, Erika was nowhere to be seen. `
`...Where did she escape to? `
`Erika had broken the barrier of the Golden Land, landing on a ship whose bow was barely in sight. `
`...Practically speaking, she had run away. `
`Fully aware of this, Erika howled, her face contorted with humiliation. `
`Her shoulders heaved with her breathing, ...and she even forgot to fix her hair... `
`The scythe fell from her hand and landed with a clank to the floor. `
`That sound brought her back to her senses. `
`"Stupid goats!! `
`What are you standing around staring for?!! `
`Open Gun Ports!! `
`Load Concept Negation Explosive Rounds!! `
`Disregard Aiming Procedures, just fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiire!!!" `
`The warships that had flown into the Golden Land opened their gun ports one after another, and then they all fired at once in a scattered mess of cannonballs. `
`The hundreds of explosive rounds they fired would negate the concept of any thing or person they touched, smashing them into little bits and setting them ablaze with flames. `
`The battlefield full of writhing goats became a fiery hell. `
`A cannonball smashed the arbor. `
`The once-beautiful garden maze was burned down bit by bit, and the fleeing gold butterflies were wrapped in flames, burning into nothingness like little scraps of paper. `
`This was no longer a battlefield where two sides fought for victory. `
`It was just a confused, hellish pot of boiling water. `
`The Golden Land...was being torn apart. `
`The once-beautiful rose garden was filled with explosion craters, and its rose petals were scattered about without pity. `
`There were flying bits of flesh, blood, fangs, jaws. `
`Shrieks and half-crazed screams. `
`And even amidst this hellish swirl, the goats and the dead continued to fight. `
`As seen from atop the boats, ...this was hell, without a doubt. `
`"All ships!! `
`Drop anchoooooooors!!" `
`When Erika yelled, the goats on the boats ran around frantically, and one by one, massive anchors hanging by chains were thrown from the ships' bows down into the earth below. `
`Those anchors smashed through not only the ground, but the bottom of the Golden Land itself, digging in with their wedge-shaped tips. `
`"Erikaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!" `
`"Oh, {f:5:Beatrice}-san!! `
`This battle's so huge, it had me worried! `
`I thought I might not be able to find you before the whole thing ended!" `
`{f:5:Beatrice} landed on the front tip of the warship, facing off against Erika, who stood on the bow. `
`"You will not be forgiven! I'll finish you myself right here!!!" `
`Beato jabbed with her pipe. `
`It transformed into a beautifully intricate golden longsword. `
`"Very well, that's just what I'd hoped for. `
`Let's settle this." `
`Erika threw her scythe up into the air. `
`When it returned to her hand, it had become a sword similar to Beato's. `
`The nearby goats crowded around Erika, trying to support her. `
`"You stay out of this. `
`All of you need to start lifting the anchors! `
`Tear up the Golden Land by its roots!!" `
`Aye aye, sir! `
`The goats bowed and rushed to their posts. `
`Several dozen ships had lowered their anchors, digging into the base of the Golden Land. `
`Soon, they were going to try and pull them up, ...tearing the Golden Land to pieces. `
`"Come, Erikaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!! `
`I'll give you the honor of my final duel!!" `
`Beato raised her sword, bowed in the ancient fashion, and waited for her opponent. `
`Erika kicked off her shoes violently and slowly walked up to the tip of the boat barefoot. `
`Then, in accordance with Beato's rules, she bowed back. `
`It was a duel on the prow of a ship that pierced the sky. `
`Below, the crowd of goats was being blasted away by the indiscriminate cannonballs, burned up and crushed in the panorama of this world's end. `
`By now, it would be stupid to wonder whether anyone from the Ushiromiya family was still all right. `
`Yes, it truly was the end of this world. `
`The end of the Golden Land. `
`Ground to dust, filled with flames. `
`The golden rose garden was burning spectacularly, with bits of fire and golden splashes flying about. `
`The ground creaked as fissures ran through it. ...Through to the base of the Golden Land. `
`All of the ships started pulling up their anchors at once. `
`Crowds of mighty goats used all of their monstrous strength to lift them. `
`The anchors that dug into the Golden Land's base...spread cracks throughout the entire Golden Land. `
`Not just the ground, but the air itself was filled with cracks, and shards of gold fell down everywhere. `
`The Golden Land's end was adorned with the flames of hell and streaking gold fragments, with fiery red and ephemeral gold. `
`Atop the boat's prow, Beato and Erika looked down on this, their swords crossed and sparks flying between them. `
`"Now there's one hell of a sight to see!! `
`Don't you think it's fitting?! `
`The perfect final chapter for your tale...!!" `
`"The Golden Land may meet its end. `
`I may perish as well. `
`However, no one can erase the fact that we were here!! `
`Ange reached the answer! `
`The Witch of the Future has a mission and hope...and will soon set off on a new journey!! `
`We have already succeeded...!! `
`Too bad for you, Furudo Erikaaaa!! `
`This battle ends with our victory!!!" `
`This was a duel between the master of the illusion called the Golden Land and the witch who controlled truth. `
`The earth split behind them. `
`The Golden Land was torn up. `
`The cat box known as the Golden Land was ripped apart, and the nothingness below peeked out through the cracks. `
`The scrambling crowd of goats fell through the gaps and were swallowed by the sea of nothingness. `
`...Beato's friends were among them. `
`They helped each other, lent a hand to each other, unwilling to sacrifice anyone until the final moment. `
`Still, ...what a romantic and fragile illusion is the end of the world. `
`The ground shattered and sank. `
`It fell apart into the ocean of nothingness. `
`None could survive. `
`None could be saved. `
`This was...destruction. `
`As the comrades-in-arms fell into the sea of nothingness, they looked up one last time...and prayed. `
`They prayed that the master of the Golden Land would leave proof that the Golden Land had indeed existed. `
`However, Beato didn't look down at them. `
`They wouldn't have wanted her to. `
`"This is our Golden Land!! `
`I am the Endless and Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}, and I am here!! `
`We may fall, but we will not be defeated!! `
`You shall become living proof! `
`I'll carve the proof of our existence into your chest!!" `
`"So long, {f:5:Beatrice}!! `
`This marks the end of that stupid endless game!! `
`Fall into hell, you illusion!!!!" `
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} and {f:5:Bernkastel}'s fight to the death had passed through its phase as a dynamic clash of fireworks...and was now a clash that was quiet and motionless. `
`...These two witches, who possessed power on an entirely different level, may have been truly equal in strength. `
`The battle could only be resolved by mutual consent, if one of them lost interest or found some reason for wanting to lose. `
`Since both were putting their all into the fight without yielding a bit, they were absolutely and completely equal... `
`"...{f:5:Lambdadelta}... `
`...I'm glad...to have you as a friend..." `
`"Dammit, just a bit longer...! `
`Just fall apart already, stupid magic circle...!" `
`Battler got irritated and punched the magic circle, but there was nothing he could do except continue to watch over it. `
`After all, the only way to dissolve it was by waiting. `
`However, the pair of them still felt relief, if only a little. `
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} really was strong. `
`Even in a battle this spectacular, she fought on an even footing. `
`No, ...if you considered how confident each side looked, she seemed to have a slight advantage in Battler's eyes. `
`She would probably manage to buy them enough time. `
`Ange would take the key and return to the Golden Land. `
`They just had to endure a bit longer... `
`......However, they had no way of knowing what {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s fate would be after this. `
`She had disobeyed the Senate, the highest-level witches in existence. `
`...Something brutal probably awaited her. `
`However, even knowing this, Ange had to step forward into the future, without looking back. `
`...That was the single duty given to her, the Witch of the Future. `
`"......Onii-chan, ...what's that...? `
`Something's coming towards us from a long way away." `
`"...?! `
`Crap, ...are they enemy reinforcements...?!" `
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} and {f:5:Bernkastel} were glaring at each other, so they didn't notice. `
`Heading towards them from the distance...were several emerald green glints. `
`That light proved that they were enemies. `
`"But there's only a few of them. `
`...They won't be a match for {f:5:Lambdadelta}." `
`"............" `
`All of the cats so far seemed like fish in a school, `
`giving the impression that they'd be terrifying as a group, but not much of a problem by themselves. `
`However, there was something different about the lights approaching them now. `
`......They were approaching in a beautiful, ordered formation, like a constellation. `
`Battler quickly realized that this was something new... `
`"...My miko, `
`isn't it about time to prepare the key...?" `
`Just by her tone, Battler was able to tell how great a witch this was. `
`The black cats that surrounded her in a graceful and systematic constellation... `
`were all wearing large capes with elegant designs. `
`...It looked as though great overlords from many worlds had been transformed into cats, leaving only their capes untouched. `
`What Battler imagined was quite true. `
`That was exactly what had happened. `
`These were the overlords from many worlds that formed {f:5:Featherine}'s personal guard. `
`Their bodies took the form of cats merely as a sign of respect to their master, who took the form of a human. `
`These were entirely different from the pack of wild cats that served {f:5:Bernkastel}. `
`"...Auaurora... `
`...Oh, is it that time already...?" `
`"When holding a party, it's important to keep your guests waiting for a fitting amount of time. `
`...It is, however, not something I am particularly fond of." `
`As she said this, her eyes flicked to {f:5:Lambdadelta}. `
`The latter bowed hurriedly. `
`Though {f:5:Lambdadelta} grinned, she was also sweating, her brow furrowed with tension. `
`"......How long it has been, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}?" `
`"It's a pleasure to see you, `
`Great Lady {f:5:Aurora}..." `
`"...This is no place to entertain one of your position. `
`...Did you get lost on the way to the party...? `
`If so, allow me to guide you there myself." `
`"...Th-That would be an honor, Great Lady {f:5:Aurora}..." `
`{f:5:Featherine Augustus Aurora}. `
`...The legendary Great Witch. `
`It is said that she surpassed the level of witches, becoming a Creator, `
`...and that, upon reaching this forbidden plane, she was cursed with a deadly ailment. `
`However, in life, she once turned her pet cat into a witch. `
`They say that this second witch wanders the sea of Fragments endlessly, searching for any Fragment that can revive her master from the pits of death called boredom, if only for a moment. `
`...And so, the cat revived her master. `
`Revived the sacred witch who had reached heights none should reach... `
`Just as witches look down at and mock Humans from a higher world, calling them pieces on a game board... `
`So she looks down at and mocks the realm of witches from an even higher world, calling them pieces on a game board. `
`...If a witch's strength is measured by the height of the world they are capable of reaching... `
`Then she was like a witch come back from the realm of the gods, one who had touched the highest, forbidden heights and survived. `
`Was there any chance of winning against her? `
`No. `
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} was unable to choose either victory or defeat by her own will. `
`"My miko, `
`would you mind playing with your friend some other time...and getting back to work now? `
`...Prepare the key." `
`"......Okay..." `
`"*cackle*cackle* `
`The simple, naive way cats forget their errand partway is their true charm. `
`...Don't you think so, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}...?" `
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} didn't say anything, but hung her head low. `
`...From this position, it seemed that the key's seal would dissolve at any second. `
`However, {f:5:Bernkastel} would probably find Battler and Ange before that. `
`Once they got their hands on the key, they could leave this place immediately. `
`...Of course, this was assuming that they did so before {f:5:Bernkastel} and {f:5:Featherine} found them. `
`......{f:5:Bernkastel}...mustn't be allowed to move from this spot. `
`"...Looks like game over, Lambda." `
`"........." `
`"I am the miko of the Great Witch {f:5:Aurora}... `
`You haven't forgotten that the Witch of Theatergoing bestows her protection upon her Reader mikos, have you...?" `
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} still stood slumped over, without answering. `
`The Witch of Theatergoing gave protection to her Reader mikos. `
`If {f:5:Lambdadelta} attacked {f:5:Bernkastel}, who was {f:5:Aurora}'s miko, `
`......then the Great Witch {f:5:Aurora} would follow her contract, prevent what she considered an attack against herself, and "respond accordingly". `
`"...Let's make a deal." `
`"...What kind of deal...?" `
`"Where is Battler hiding? `
`If you come clean, we'll let all of this slide." `
`"Is the Witch of Miracles afraid of a tiny, little piece like Battler?" `
`"...It's because I'm the Witch of Miracles. `
`...I'll never forget that even a little pebble like him is capable of creating a miracle." `
`"After all, there's a little pebble who got super-promoted into a Witch of Miracles." `
`"I'll ask one more time. Where is Battler?" `
`"........." `
`"...Too bad, Lambda. `
`It looks like that's your answer." `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} turned her back on {f:5:Lambdadelta}. `
`Then, she told her master that she was leaving to prepare the key, ...and she started swimming towards the key room. `
`......If I let her go...any further, ......she'll find Battler and Ange... `
`Battler readied himself. `
`This time, it was his turn to become a sacrifice...... `
`Even though he was nothing more than a single pebble, ...he could still put out an eye. `
`A candy firework exploded right in front of {f:5:Bernkastel}. `
`"......Lambda, `
`...you really are a moron." `
`"...L-{f:5:Lambdadelta}......" `
`"......Now I've done it... `
`...Battler, Ange, `
`...the rest is up to you...!" `
`The cat overlords changed their formation, becoming a ferocious constellation that surrounded {f:5:Featherine}. `
`Then, each drew the most terrifying of magic circles from their respective worlds...and began to chant. `
`"......... `
`...I am slightly confused. `
`...Both by you, my miko, and Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}. `
`...What sort of sideshow is this...?" `
`"......It looks like Lambda wants to stop me from going to get the key." `
`"Hoh. `
`...And what would the point of that be, I wonder?" `
`"If you still don't get the point, `
`...then you must be getting a bit tipsy, {f:5:Featherine}. `
`Looks like you need a pick-me-up." `
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} bluffed as well as she could. `
`Her fingertips were shaking slightly. `
`"......An attack against a miko is considered to be an attack against her master. `
`...You should know this as well as anyone, correct...?" `
`"I know it. `
`...Going by that rule, it looks like the two of us are gonna have to fight." `
`"Hoh. `
`......Have I or my miko caused insult in any way? `
`If so, then please accept my apologies." `
`"But could you tell me one thing? `
`I didn't think you had a miko at the moment. `
`...How long have you had one?" `
`"As for that, `
`...I've got a ton of them already...!! `
`30 or 40, I think. `
`Maybe even more!" `
`"I, {f:5:Lambdadelta}, will handle any fight picked against one of my mikos, no matter who the opponent is...!! `
`All of them are certain that a happy ending will come!! `
`As the Witch of Certainty, I can't abandon people who work hard and believe with certainty like that!!!" `
`"......I can't say I dislike this tale of yours. `
`It would be worthy of my viewing. `
`...However, I am not a spectator at the moment, but a performer. `
`...I know that you are my miko's close friend, so I will give you one warning. `
`......Remove yourself from this stage. `
`I will prepare a special seat for you in my audience seating." `
`"......I've been thinking about which is more interesting: ...your tale, or the one I've been watching." `
`"......And your conclusion?" `
`"Battler's tale is a hundred times better...!! `
`Sorry, but I'll be getting Best Supporting Actress this year!! `
`...Hey, you guys! `
`You'd better vote for me in the last character popularity contest, okay?! `
`At least get me in the top 5! Got it?!" `
`"......Who are you talking to?" `
`As {f:5:Lambdadelta} pretended to joke around, ...she calmly focused on the one weak point she could see. `
`If she had a chance for a single attack, ...then a one-in-a-billion shot at victory existed. `
`It was that horseshoe-shaped memory device floating around {f:5:Featherine}'s head. `
`Without that, she couldn't preserve her own existence. `
`Destroying it was impossible, `
`...but if {f:5:Lambdadelta} could just jar it enough, ...she might be able to make it bug out. `
`At least once in the past, {f:5:Featherine}'s memory device had been damaged, and her personality and appearance had changed. `
`...However, she was aware of that herself...and probably wouldn't let that happen again no matter what. `
`"...Very well, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}. `
`When you've finished your script, feel free to send it in whenever you wish." `
`"The script is simple. `
`...Just one line. `
`'The fantastic, cute {f:5:Lambdadelta}-sama... `
`took out the evil mastermind Auaurora in a single shot!'" `
`"Foolish Lambda. `
`...I never realized how stupid you were." `
`"...The cats need not interfere. `
`...I will personally reward Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} for the courageous tale she has submitted. `
`...You will be granted a fitting tale and a fitting ending for your bravery." `
`"{f:5:Featherine Augustus}...Auauroraaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!" `
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} summoned magical power from her whole body and raised it in a mass above her head. `
`"Forgive me, but..." `
`Then, the world's time stopped. `
`"Your script will not be used. `
`...After all..." `
`Rather than time stopping, ...it was more like the flipping pages of a book had stopped. `
`In this motionless world, ...closely packed letters appeared. `
`"The one writing the rest of the script...is me." `
`It was a tale...that had been written up to this very moment. `
`{e:85:{f:0:"Featherine Augustus...Auauroraaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"}} `
`{e:85:{f:0:Lambdadelta summoned magical power from her whole body and raised it in a mass above her head.}} `
`That was where the paragraph ended. `
`In this frozen world, {f:5:Featherine} sat with her arms crossed. `
`"...How troublesome. `
`...It's been so long since I've written a fight scene. `
`...How annoying to have to suddenly write up a development like this out of the blue..." `
`When I get stuck writing, I try to write in reverse. `
`In other words, instead of starting at the beginning, I start at the end and go backwards from there. `
`That way, it's easier to set up foreshadowing, and I can write the story with my vision for the end in mind. `
`...The only downside is that I have to suddenly start at the climax without setting up the story first. `
`"......In the meantime, `
`I'll start at the end of the fight and go back from there. `
`...Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, `
`this is where you lose to me and die." `
`As {f:5:Featherine} said this, words were added to the massive group of letters that filled the frozen world. `
`However, she was starting from the end, so there was a large gap between the new words and the old ones. `
`"...So, how will you lose to me? `
`...You should probably have a heroic end to suit your bravery. `
`...How about this? `
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} gets blasted away by something, slammed against the bookshelf, `
`and her limbs are snapped off as she dies and disappears into the darkness below. `
`...Yes. `
`Quite a flashy way to go. `
`......Good. For now, that's how your final moments will be." `
`The blanks in the outline {f:5:Featherine} spoke of were being filled up. `
`At the same time, {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s figure was wiped out. `
`After crossing her arms and thinking again, {f:5:Featherine} pointed in a random direction. `
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} appeared, blasted away by "something" and slammed spreadeagled against the bookshelf {f:5:Featherine} had pointed at. `
`"......Well now, I must write up the fierce battle that leads to this end, `
`...but as you can probably tell, I'm a little tipsy at the moment. `
`...I'll fill that part in later, when I have some time to go over it nice and slowly." `
`"...For now, let me off with this. `
`I promise to add in a heroic fight to your liking later on..." `
`{f:5:Featherine} snapped her fingers. `
`...{f:5:Lambdadelta}...had no idea what was going on. `
`Before she could even blink, ...she was suddenly here, being slammed against a bookshelf. `
`"...W...h...a...t......i...s......t...h...i...s..." `
`She couldn't comprehend the "something" that {f:5:Featherine} had killed her with. `
`However, that was only natural. `
`After all, {f:5:Featherine} herself hadn't decided what the "something" was. `
`However, {f:5:Lambdadelta} did understand one thing. `
`She was already dead. `
`Streams of blood dripped from the corners of her mouth. `
`Then, lines of blood appeared on her wrists and ankles, her elbows and knees. `
`She looked like a marionette doll of herself. `
`"......W...h...a...t......k...i...l...l...e...d......m...e..." `
`"Precisely, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}. `
`Let me know if you have any good ideas." `
`"...Y...o...u......m...o...n...s...t...e...r......" `
`Still pinned against the bookshelf, ...{f:5:Lambdadelta} let her head slump. `
`Her wrists, ankles, legs, arms, and neck... `
`each split into a separate part, ...and the marionette shaped like her lost its strings, falling in pieces into the depths below. `
`Nothing remained. `
`It was all swallowed up by the darkness beneath them... `
`"A monster, she says. `
`...Quite a compliment, for one such as I. `
`...*cackle*cackle*cackle* Ahhahahahahahahahahaha." `
`"...L-{f:5:Lambdadelta}..." `
`"Ange, ...don't look. You can't look...!!" `
`Shedding frustrated tears, Ange closed her eyes tight. `
`She must not look. `
`The Witch of the Future...must not accept {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s defeat... `
`"She hasn't kicked it yet! `
`She was brave, and that's all we need to know...!!" `
`"I know...!! `
`I know {f:5:Lambdadelta}...would never lose...!!" `
`*pop* `
`At that moment, there was a slight sound, ...and the golden key that hung in the air...shook. `
`...The seal had finally broken. `
`Battler grabbed at it immediately. `
`However, at exactly the same moment, a magical tremor spread throughout the vast key room. `
`"Wh-What?!" `
`That tremor...seemed to have shaken something inside my pocket. `
`I stuck my hand in...and found that the Fragment {f:5:Lambdadelta} had given us to return to the Golden Land...had shattered. `
`"...D-Dammit, ...Lambda's Fragment is...!" `
`"...You were so close too. `
`Now, there's nowhere to run." `
`"{f:5:Bernkastel}..." `
`"If Lambda had been a little cleverer, she probably could've bought you five more seconds. `
`...Then, you would've taken that key and escaped to the Golden Land. `
`...Looks like the miko suffers too when their master's a fool. `
`Ahhahahahahaha." `
`"......Hoh." `
`{f:5:Featherine} quietly showed her surprise. `
`...To truly surprise her was no easy task. `
`The Witch of Miracles, who boasted that no one could even step on her shadow unless she wished it, ...fell. `
`After taking Battler's right fist to her face, she fell. `
`{f:5:Bernkastel}'s body immediately split into dust and reconstructed itself in front of Battler. `
`As though nothing had happened. `
`However, she was holding her cheek. `
`She couldn't undo the fact that she had been hit. `
`For the first time in a hundred years, she had let someone tread on her shadow without her consent. `
`Her face was gradually filled with shock. `
`And Battler's? `
`...It couldn't be seen. `
`His outstretched right arm was blocking it, so his expression couldn't be seen... `
`"............" `
`"............Wh-What?" `
`"......Take it back." `
`"......T-Take what back......?" `
`She didn't let the next strike hit her. `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} vanished like mist, then reappeared a short distance away. `
`However, Battler only missed by a hair's breadth. `
`Not because she had intentionally made that happen, ...but for real. `
`"......It hurts......it hurts, it hurts......" `
`Finally, she truly began to feel the pain of being punched in the face. `
`For too many years, she had forgotten the very concept of pain. `
`Very slowly, ...it was coming back to her. `
`"It hurts! ...It hurts, it hurts, it hurts...aaaaghghhh!!" `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} writhed in anguish, holding her cheek. `
`That feeling, forgotten for centuries, seemed to be hitting home hard. `
`Battler looked at her. `
`Their eyes met. `
`...Once again, {f:5:Bernkastel} remembered the emotion she had forgotten for hundreds of years. `
`"......Does it hurt?" `
`".........!!!" `
`"The pain you caused by ridiculing my friend......is greater than that." `
`And then, she shuddered. `
`What Battler saw before his eyes...was {f:5:Bernkastel} shuddering for the first time in centuries. `
`To {f:5:Bernkastel}'s eyes, it hadn't even looked like Battler rushing at her and punching. `
`It was as though...she had been sucked towards where he stood with his furious fist raised. `
`When her eyes had opened wide in terror, ...Battler's massive fist had been all that she could see. `
`Of course, he wasn't capable of hitting her. `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} was just like a shadow. `
`True, trying to hit Bern was like enviously trying to hit the reflection of the moon on water with a stone. `
`No matter how often you hit it, you can never smash the moon's reflection. `
`However, Battler hit it. And again. `
`Over and over. `
`To prevent the moon from showing on the water's surface again. `
`A fiercely thrown pebble sent ripples across the water's surface. `
`It broke through the moon's reflection, broke through the water's surface itself, ...leaving even the bottom of the pond bare, ...breaking through everything. `
`His certain willpower...broke through to a miracle. `
`A backwards kick that Battler shot out without even looking behind him...split through empty space. `
`In that space, ...{f:5:Bernkastel} reappeared with a foot in her gut. `
`"Geh......agh......" `
`"...Take back your insults against our brave friend." `
`"Uuh, ......ghh... ...ggggghh......" `
`The Witch of Miracles fell. `
`For the second time, she fell. `
`Once, it would have been a miracle. `
`Things that happen more than once aren't miracles anymore. `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} understood. `
`Battler...was capable of hitting her... `
`Then, she fell, ...was slammed against the floor, ...got up on her hands and knees, and vomited. `
`She threw up violently over and over. `
`Her face was covered with pain and vomit and tears and snot. `
`Then, she looked up at Battler with a furious expression...and howled. `
`And she wasn't howling at Battler. `
`"A-Auaurora...!! `
`Y-Your miko is getting beaten up! `
`What are you standing around watching for?! Take him out!!!" `
`"Forgive me, but I am busy writing Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s final moments right now. `
`...I cannot come to your aid. `
`......Why don't you all give her a hand?" `
`{f:5:Featherine}'s guard, the cat overlords, now formed a different constellation. `
`Then, each drew a magic circle and began chanting. `
`"Aha, ahhahahahahahahahaha!! `
`You know what?! Each one of these cats is the final form of a main character, each from a game like yours!! `
`Every one acted the main part in their heroic tale, and the story of their bravery was given honor, allowing them to become {f:5:Aurora}'s guards!! `
`Each one fought for the very existence of their country, their planet, their universe!!" `
`"What about you?! `
`Ahhahaha, at best, you've just been playing around with your little sister and some imaginary witch!! `
`These main characters are on a totally different level from you!! `
`Eat this and die, take it to the gut, scum!!!" `
`"...O-Onii-chan......!!!" `
`Their many spectacular magical spells depicted the beginning of a universe, the creation of planets, their destruction and the universe's end, all in an instant. `
`After that, not a speck of dust should have remained... `
`However, `
`when the smoke cleared, there was a person standing there. `
`It stood there......with its hands in its pockets...and its head hanging quietly. `
`Its face was in shadows and couldn't be seen. `
`"...Onii-chan......" `
`"What...the hell...?" `
`Battler...seemed to be completely uninjured. `
`Not only were his clothes not burnt, but his hair hadn't even been disturbed. `
`"...Wh-What the hell?!?! `
`Stupid cats, that didn't work at all!!" `
`The cat overlords silently shook their heads, sending a short report to their master. `
`"{ruby:Endless Nine:99.9999999}..." `
`"What...did you say......?" `
`"It seems that no one can interfere with their tale. `
`Forgive me, my miko. `
`It would appear that the cats have reached their limit." `
`"...A-And you call yourselves overlords of many worlds?!! `
`Weren't you all once main characters on different game boards?! `
`And this is the best you can do?! `
`You're pathetic!!" `
`The cats knew. `
`From the very beginning... `
`They had known that they wouldn't be able to do anything with him as the main character of this game board. `
`"...My miko, `
`creating a tale on the game board is a privilege granted only to the Game Master. `
`That has already been established, so I must respect that rule, being the mere writer that I am. `
`I shall return to my position as a spectator." `
`"Y-You useless master...!!!" `
`"......Battler, `
`I apologize for the insults your friend suffered at the hands of my miko. `
`And I see that the right to weave your game belongs to you, the Game Master. `
`You shall weave your own game. `
`That is as it should be." `
`"........." `
`"However, my miko is now a Game Master in your game. `
`...It seems the two of you opened the game board at the same time. `
`It is rare to have two Masters for a single game, but this miracle pleases me. `
`...After all, I can rest assured that this will make for a proper final game for you both." `
`"......Stand up, `
`{f:5:Bernkastel}." `
`"......I see... `
`...So, you're saying that if two Game Masters are going to fight, ...they have to do it by the rules of the game... `
`......*giggle*, ...*giggle*giggle* `
`...Why didn't you just say that in the first place...?" `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} slowly got to her feet and made her body melt away like mist. `
`Then, she appeared in the air once again, facing Battler. `
`"Very well. `
`...I'll fight by the rules of your game board. `
`However, I'm not as easygoing as you all are, so I'll start with a short-tempered, overwhelming puzzle and end this in an instant. `
`Who will be my opponent? `
`I don't mind if you both take me on at once." `
`"Onii-chan, I'll fight too." `
`"......Stay back." `
`"Why...?!" `
`"Watch from there. `
`And this time, ...understand what I wanted to teach you." `
`"......Onii-chan..." `
`"Are you happy with this, {f:5:Aurora}?!" `
`"...I shall be your witness. `
`If you defeat my miko, I promise to return you all to the Golden Land." `
`"*giggle*giggle* `
`Assuming the Golden Land still exists, that is." `
`"I...believe in them." `
`"That's right... `
`Beato...and all the others...won't lose...!" `
`"*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*...!!! `
`In that case, we'd better start with the bad news. `
`...Erika, you can make your report now. `
`Come!" `
`When {f:5:Bernkastel} snapped her fingers, Erika appeared with a bow. `
`"Pardon me for the interruption, my master." `
`"...Sorry, Erika. `
`How inconsiderate of me, to keep you waiting when you came bearing good news." `
`"No problem! `
`Rejoice, my master. `
`I have come to inform you of the complete destruction of the Golden Land!" `
`"...Liar!!" `
`"The Golden Land has been totally destroyed. `
`I'm here to report that it's collapsed and fallen into the sea of nothingness. `
`Not just the Humans, but the Illusions as well have been completely annihilated." `
`"Liar!! `
`I won't believe it!" `
`"...Then allow me to make you believe it. `
`Take this, my master." `
`Erika humbly presented an object wrapped in cloth. `
`It shone with a golden light. `
`"...What's this? `
`A golden apple?" `
`"This is the heart of {f:5:Beatrice}, master of the Golden Land...!" `
`"...B-Beato......!!" `
`"........." `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} pinched it between two fingers, held it aloft, and gazed at it. `
`"...Even like this, it's still beating. `
`...You're so cute, {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`...The game board that you are might be opened again by someone. `
`...You still believe that, don't you...?" `
`"I-It's okay, Onii-chan... `
`We didn't see Beato get defeated...! `
`This is some sort of trick they're using on us. `
`A trick to make us lose our morale...! `
`Or maybe it's a trick of Beato's! `
`She changed herself to pretend that she's been defeated. `
`There's no way that {f:5:Beatrice}...that everyone...that the Golden Land could be destroyed...!!" `
`"*giggle* `
`......*giggle*giggle*giggle* Ahhahahahahahhhahahahaha!! `
`That's true. If the Witch of the Future believes that, you might be able to make it so... `
`...So, let me show you. `
`Look closely, Witch of the Future from 1998." `
`{f:5:Bernkastel}...threw the golden heart into the air like an apple. `
`Then, with the blood-red blade of the scythe that appeared in her hand, ...she split it... `
`{p:1:{f:5:Beatrice} died in October of 1986. `
`Therefore, the Golden Land she created was completely destroyed. `
`Your family that was kept alive in the Golden Land was destroyed along with it. `
`Your father, mother, and of course Battler...will never return to you again...and will never speak your name again.}" `
`".........Ah..." `
`"The Witch of the Future has the power to interpret things how she pleases and overwrite what happened. `
`...However, there is just one fact that she can't overwrite, no matter how much she struggles." `
`"...And that is...death. `
`You cannot overcome any concept of death, be it physical or mental. `
`...It is the single blade of truth with which witches of the past can strike down witches of the future..." `
`"......Ah, ......ah......ah......" `
`"Hang in there, Ange." `
`"......But, ......but......" `
`"You decided to accept it, didn't you? `
`...You decided to live on, even if no one came back alive, ...didn't you...?" `
`"...I know... ...I know, but... ...But...!!!" `
`Even so, ...a tiny sliver of hope...had remained inside Ange's heart. `
`Despite everything, `
`...if she was favored by some miracle, `
`...maybe someone would come home after all. `
`It doesn't matter when. `
`It could be ten years later or fifty years later. `
`It doesn't even matter if they've forgotten my face... `
`I believed that someone might come back someday... `
`...And I decided to live with that tiny hope in my heart. `
`...Even though I accepted everyone's death, ...even though I saw it in the Book of the Single Truth, `
`I still thought......that it wouldn't be so bad...to believe in a miracle, ...just a little...... `
`A miracle you believe in, even though you know it won't happen, ......is hope. `
`So, the witch who knew that miracles don't occur......had ruthlessly torn that hope away. `
`"Don't cry." `
`"I know...!! `
`But, ...but!!" `
`"Even the big brother you're crying to right now...is already dead." `
`"Onii-chan isn't dead, he's here!! `
`Right here!!!" `
`"Don't cry, Ange." `
`"But, ...but!!!" `
`"Don't cry!!!" `
`At Battler's shout, Ange bit back her tears. `
`"Why...does it matter? `
`......What do we of the past mean to you, living in the future? `
`......Ange, `
`what sort of witch were you?" `
`"......Huh?" `
`"Whether we're alive or dead means nothing to you." `
`"Th-That's not true... `
`I want you to live...!" `
`"That's not it!! `
`You can go beyond life and death, right?!!" `
`Ange didn't understand what he was telling her. `
`So, stunned into silence, she frantically considered what her brother might be trying to say. `
`Battler slowly lifted his face...and stared at {f:5:Bernkastel}. `
`"......And...you aren't a witch. `
`......You're a reaper." `
`"That's right. `
`I have the sickle that reaps all hope and miracles. `
`So I must be what you say." `
`"...You're a reaper, who stole away the hope that kept Ange alive... `
`...and lured her towards death." `
`You're the one who threw about truths of the past, stealing the future from Ange's eyes and forcing her to look only at the past. `
`And, you're the one who thrust the hope-crushing Single Truth in front of her, gently pushing her from behind as she, of her own accord, took that step from the skyscraper's roof off into the world of nothingness. `
`"But now, I'll free Ange from the spell that you represent!! `
`Ange won't be trapped by the curse of the past anymore!! `
`She'll step forward into the future!! `
`But not into the emptiness of the abyss that you're trying to lure her into. `
`...Ange will live strong...in the future starting in 1998!!" `
`"Humans are wretched creatures, who walk into the future while staring back into the past!! `
`That's why they easily plummet into pitfalls and flip over like comical fools!!" `
`"Come, {f:5:Bernkastel}!!! `
`A witch of the past like you can't block the radiance of the future!!" `
`"Aha, ahhahahahahahahahaha!!! `
`Yes, let's go, let's follow the rules of your game!! `
`I'll give you some closed room riddles. `
`But, since I'm short-tempered, heavy-handed, and easily bored, I'll give you all of them at once!!!" `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} spread her hands, and it seemed as though a halo or angel wings were spreading out behind her. `
`Each of the countless rays that spread out from her...were the blue streaks of closed room mystery blades. `
`{f:5:Bernkastel}, who had traveled the sea of Fragments for many, many years, had gathered these countless closed room mysteries as souvenirs from all over the place. `
`All of those rays twisted at once...and aimed towards Battler. `
`It was as though infinite giant snakes had turned their heads to stare at him. `
`"......If you fail to shoot down even a single puzzle, `
`then this is goodbye. `
`I'm not as forgiving as Beato, who gave you until October 5 at midnight to give your answer. `
`If you don't answer immediately, you'll die." `
`In other words, this was no "mystery". `
`This wasn't an intellectual game, but a merciless assault. `
`"Die." `
`"......!!!" `
`All at once, hundreds of guided lasers known as mysteries shot at Battler. `
`The complex geometric figure drawn by those blue lasers was nothing but divinely beautiful. `
`Each one was a mystery. `
`Trying to solve each one in this oppressive hailstorm would be like threading a storm of approaching needles. `
`Battler flew freely through this vast space, dodging the beautiful blue streaks of mystery as he shot them down one after another. `
`The entirety of the mystery knowledge he had built up before this day told him the answer to each puzzle. `
`Each time his eyes glowed with the answer, one of the mysteries shattered. `
`However, each mystery was only one out of hundreds. `
`This hardly rose to the level of "opposition" or "resistance". `
`"......Onii-chan, it's impossible...!! `
`Run!!" `
`"There is no unsolvable mystery, ...just like there is no inescapable fate." `
`"Onii-chan...!!" `
`"Watch, Ange. `
`Don't miss what I'm trying to show you..." `
`By now, the bundle of mysteries looked like one giant snake with blue streaming behind it. `
`Battler skillfully dodged it, precisely splitting its many fangs off one by one. `
`...Even though he knew his resistance was useless, like trying to pick up all the grains of sand on a beach one by one. `
`"Not bad. `
`......Classic mysteries were your specialty, right? `
`Then what about twists on the genre? `
`Let's see if you can handle more and more mysteries from all times and places." `
`Even though Battler was still fighting the giant snake, wings appeared behind Bern once more. `
`And......they gave birth to seven more huge snakes. `
`It now looked like a great dragon with seven heads. `
`"Ushiromiya Battler, `
`it's true that you're a very avid reader and an expert on the mystery genre. `
`But you're still young. `
`...There's a limit to how many books and mysteries you could've read. `
`...Learn that this world is filled with countless riddles and tricks that you've never heard of." `
`"...Onii-chan!! `
`You can't do this anymore!!! `
`Please, just run away!! `
`You can't beat {f:5:Bernkastel}!!" `
`Battler's expression remained calm. `
`However, his whole body was covered with sweat, and he was breathing hard. `
`It was clear that he couldn't overcome this onslaught, though Battler himself refused to admit it. `
`Battler wiped away his sweat...and fixed his gaze on the eight snake heads that surrounded him in three dimensions... `
`"...Ange, `
`......you believed that someone from your family would come back some day, `
`lived that way for 12 years, ...and then lost your spirit. `
`For a time, you surrendered to the miracle that refused to happen." `
`"......That's..." `
`"In that case, `
`...if I want to see you off as you try and step forward into the future, `
`...I mustn't surrender to a miracle myself." `
`"That's right. `
`But I'll still harvest your miracles and hopes. `
`All of them, without mercy." `
`What was now an eight-headed dragon...opened its eight jaws. `
`It looked for weak points from all angles, hoping to swallow Battler in a single gulp. `
`He wouldn't be able to dodge any longer. `
`"Ange-san, `
`...if you're expecting a miracle, then I have some bad news for you." `
`"......?!" `
`"Beato has now been completely destroyed, and it's even been announced in red. `
`Do you know what that means?" `
`"........." `
`"Since Beato has been destroyed, the Golden Land has been destroyed as well. `
`...That means that everyone has vanished. `
`In other words, you no longer have any friends who can conveniently show up and save you from this pinch." `
`Beato has been destroyed, and that's been confirmed in red. `
`...Therefore, no one else could come to rescue them. `
`...Even {f:5:Eva} was a resident of the Golden Land. `
`After bravely breaking the key's seal earlier on, she had probably hidden away somewhere. `
`However, now that Beato had been destroyed, ...all of the residents of the Golden Land had met the same fate as ice under the sun... `
`Any faint hopes Ange might have had that {f:5:Eva} was hiding in the shadows, ready to save them from this final pinch, `
`...had been completely crushed from the moment {f:5:Bernkastel} smashed that golden heart... `
`There was no one left to save them from this crisis. `
`She couldn't hope for the appearance of any new factor that might save her brother. `
`And what about Ange herself? `
`She could only watch from where she stood. `
`If I help, will I be able to bring about some kind of miracle...? `
`But I don't know that much about the mystery genre. `
`I've only watched Beato's game Fragments, gathering some basic training on how to fight. `
`At best, I can avoid slowing him down, ...but I can't protect my brother. `
`But...I can't just watch... `
`"O-Onii-chan...!! `
`Let me fight too...!!" `
`"Stay back! `
`...Just...keep watching. `
`...And think." `
`"Think about what...?!!" `
`"Go back to how you felt at the very beginning, ......back when you were six years old, ...when it all started." `
`"...How I felt...when I was six..." `
`"You've lived for 12 years looking for the truth. `
`...But that's not your real, greatest wish." `
`"...My...greatest wish......" `
`"We prepared this final game...to protect that wish and that hope. `
`Unfortunately, you've wasted that chance. `
`...So, you'll have to abandon that hope as you step forward into the future. `
`......But even so, `
`even so, ...if there's strength in your heart, ...you can still have it." `
`"...Have what......?" `
`"Remember... `
`your very first wish. `
`...Even after learning the Single Truth, remember." `
`The Single Truth. `
`Even after learning the heartless truth...that everyone is dead and no one will come home, ...remember. `
`Remember your very first wish. `
`"Onii-chan!!!" `
`There was a cataclysmic flash, as brilliant as the birth of a sun. `
`All of the palely glowing snakes...ran through Battler. `
`He was stained red, surrounded with a cloud of blood. `
`Then, he stumbled, ...and in the end, he looked at Ange. `
`Ange...couldn't say anything in response. `
`The light in Battler's eyes faded, ......and, slowly, ...his body began to fall... `
`It reached the ground...and gently landed like something settling on the ocean floor. `
`Ange rushed toward him...and saw the last expression that would ever cross her dead brother's face. `
`His eyes were opened wide, ...filled with an unwavering determination until the very last second... `
`"......Was Ange-san ever that good at mysteries?" `
`"She's nothing compared to Battler." `
`The waving snakes raised their heads...and surrounded Ange. `
`Ange...had no blades to fight with. `
`She could only cling to her brother's dead face, saying his name over and over. `
`"This is a surprisingly boring ending. `
`......I guess that's checkmate." `
`"............" `
`The eight snake heads......all attacked at once. `
`Ange held her brother's dead face, ...thinking about his final words... `
`My very first wish... It could only be one thing... `
`That everyone......would come home... `
`That fueled my life for 12 years, until I finally wore out and abandoned my own hope. `
`In exchange for the hope I'd abandoned, I began searching for the truth. `
`Then, at the end of the truth, ...I was forced to see a brutal ruthlessness that I didn't need to know about, `
`...and as a result, I was faced with the true despair of knowing that no one would come home. `
`That final hope, ...which I still felt attached to even after abandoning it, was crushed. `
`The Single Truth. `
`If only I didn't know that, ...I might still be able to hold onto that faint hope. `
`But, ......now...... `
`{a:c:You can still have it.} `
`{a:c:If there's strength in your heart, `
`you can still have it.} `
`{a:c:Remember...your very first wish.} `
`".........Gahah, ...ggghh!" `
`Battler was coughing. `
`Impossible. `
`His whole body had been pierced, and he had been completely dead. `
`For him to cough would be too much of a miracle to be possible. `
`"What?!! `
`Why?! `
`Battler died!! `
`So why...why was he revived?!" `
`Battler rose to his feet slowly. `
`Though blood still dribbled from his mouth, his expression was fearless. `
`However, Ange didn't stand up. `
`She kept sitting, her head lowered. `
`"......Well, that was a nice warm-up. `
`...Shall we get started, {f:5:Bernkastel}?! `
`Time for Round 2...!!" `
`"Wh-What in the...why, my master?! `
`The dead can't revive!!" `
`"Impossible!! `
`......{p:1:Battler is dead}!!! `
`How can he revive?!" `
`"......Onii-chan......is alive......" `
`"{p:1:I've used the red truth!! `
`I've announced that Battler died}, right?! `
`So why, how did he come back to life?!?!" `
`"Even if the whole world says he died, `
`......I'll be the one person in the world who believes... `
`...Onii-chan is alive. `
`And, someday, ...he'll come back to me." `
`"That's right. `
`...As long as you hold onto that hope, ...none of your miracles will ever be destroyed!" `
`"...H-How dare you stand before the Witch of Miracles...and claim to understand theeeeeeeeem?!! `
`Uuuuurrrrrgggggggghghh, swallow them, grind them up, `
`erase both siblings noooooooooooooooww!!!" `
`{a:c: `
`You can't erase us.} `
`""Even if the whole world refuses to accept it, miracles will happen if we continue to believe!!"" `
`The eight wriggling snake heads transformed into a massive whale jaw...and swallowed everything. `
`"There will be no miracle!! `
`{p:1:You can't open your heart to anyone who exists!!} `
`So diiiiiiiiiiiie!!!" `
`{a:c: `
`"You're wrong. `
`...Everyone...will protect me."} `
`The cruel whale of mystery that tried to swallow everything...was gouged deeply by a massive wedge. `
`This deeply pounded wedge could only be used by those who had talent and a deep love for mysteries. `
`"That trick's such a clicheeeeeeeee...!! `
`I read and got bored of that one ages ago!" `
`The woman who stood back to back with Battler, launching stakes, ...was very, very clearly... `
`"Beato?!?! `
`How?! `
`{p:1:I announced your death with the red truth!!}" `
`"......And what is this red truth of yours...?" `
`"{p:1:The red truth is absolute!! `
`A perfect truth, which no one can overturn no matter how hard they try!!}" `
`"Even if the whole world gets together... `
`...and denies the truth about my family, `
`...even if that's forced in front of my eyes as the Single Truth, `
`...I won't acknowledge it. `
`After all..." `
`Ange slowly rose to her feet. `
`Around her, ...the shapes of people slowly appeared, and they also rose to their feet. `
`One after another, a whole crowd of them. `
`They were...Ange's family, her relatives. `
`Everyone from Rokkenjima. `
`That wasn't all. `
`Everyone from the Golden Land and all of the Illusions appeared and, following Ange's lead, they rose to their feet. `
`Then, all of them glared at {f:5:Bernkastel}. `
`"Even if the whole world denies my hope, I won't abandon it. `
`I won't abandon my certain hope that everyone's alive. `
`...And, I've found something. `
`......I've found...how I'll live as a witch." `
`"......Y-You... ...Weren't you just a Witch of the Future...? `
`Just a powerless witch who could only shed tears of regret for the past...?!" `
`"I'm the Golden Witch, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}. `
`...I am the Golden, the Endless, `
`and the Witch of Resurrection." `
`"......You've found it, haven't you, Ange?" `
`"Yeah. `
`Thanks, Onee-chan. `
`...After all those long years, I've finally found it." `
`"I always knew you'd be able to find it." `
`"Thanks, Onii-chan. `
`...I've understood... `
`what your last game was trying to show me." `
`"Disappear, stupid delusions!!! `
`I can't... `
`I can't accept something like thiiiiiiiiiiis!!!" `
`"Everyone will be with me for eternity. `
`No matter how many times people try to kill them with the red truth, `
`...I'll reject it. `
`Everyone will be revived for me no matter how many times it takes. `
`......I am {f:5:Ange}, Witch of Resurrection!! `
`Your red truth can't lay a finger on my world!!!" `
`"Uuurrrggggaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaggghhh!!!" `
`Ange--or rather, Ange and her family and her friends--all fired off golden streaks at once. `
`They were the same as the marks left by {f:5:Bernkastel}'s great snakes. `
`However, the glow inside these...was gold. `
`Then, they wriggled, combined into one single mass, and transformed into an eagle that now had two wings. `
`It wasn't one-winged anymore. `
`Thanks to Ange's absolute willpower, the golden eagle had gained the wing it needed to fly into the future. `
`Those spread wings......made {f:5:Bernkastel} and the whale shrink back. `
`"The Ushiromiya eagle never looks back." `
`"And it never gives up...!!" `
`The golden eagle easily swallowed the blue whale with its wings, grinding it to bits. `
`And it didn't let the whale's master escape either. `
`It was now {f:5:Bernkastel}'s turn to run. `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} didn't fight the golden eagle. `
`She couldn't. `
`In this world of Ange's, where even the red truth couldn't hurt anyone, what sort of attack could affect her? `
`She frantically ran this way and that, throwing one wedge of red truth after another at the Ushiromiya family. `
`{a:c: `
`{p:1:Ushiromiya Kinzo is dead}. `
`{p:1:Ushiromiya Krauss is dead}. `
`{p:1:Ushiromiya Natsuhi is dead}.} `
`She repeated this over and over again, ......but no one fell down. `
`Ange wouldn't accept it, so they couldn't pierce anyone. `
`"...Th-This is... `
`Is this sort of Endless Nine even possible...?! `
`E-Even the red truth...doesn't work?!! `
`Just what is this gold truth?!! `
`What kind of gold truth could defeat red truth...?!!!" `
`"A believing heart. `
`...This is "our" consensus. `
`...Your red truth can't pierce any part of the truth that we all acknowledge and share." `
`"......So long, {f:5:Bernkastel}! `
`...This time, it's really checkmate." `
`"I-I......won't accept something like this, `
`I woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooon't!!!" `
`The massive golden eagle...finally swallowed {f:5:Bernkastel} whole. `
`It then slammed into the vast ceiling, ...and there was an incredible explosion accompanied by an earthquake. `
`From the cracked ceiling, along with many falling chips, ...a single black cat plummeted...and slammed against the floor. `
`Erika ran up to it, repeatedly calling out to her master, hugging it. `
`Then, she realized that it was still breathing, and simultaneous expressions of relief and shock rose to her face. `
`"...Don't worry. `
`I won't let you lay a finger on my truth, but in the same way, I won't lay a finger on your truth." `
`"...She looks like a wet mop." `
`"Call it a good scolding, free of charge." `
`"Beato, `
`don't act too cozy with my big brother. `
`I still haven't accepted your relationship, got it?" `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`It was quite bold of you to revive me, fool! `
`But it's too late. My charming subordinates and I shall torment you until the day you die!! `
`And I'll make you watch Battler flirt with me every day!! `
`Wah?!" `
`"Oh, that's pretty convenient. `
`Looks like this resurrection magic has an off switch." `
`"Wha......wai......An......!!" `
`Beato kept appearing and disappearing like a lightbulb turning on and off. `
`Ange seemed to be enjoying herself. `
`"Waaaaaaah, Battleeeeeeeer, Ange's being mean!" `
`"Go easy on her, Ange." `
`"Sure. `
`If you say so, Onii-chan." `
`"Ange, you're incredible!! Uryu-!!" `
`"Ange-sama!! `
`Congratulations on becoming a Witch of Resurrection!! `
`This way, we'll all...be with you forever!" `
`"Yeah, that's right. `
`We're all here. `
`...The anti-magic toxin doesn't matter one bit. `
`You'll be with me for all eternity." `
`"Nice, Ange. `
`Well said!!" `
`Everyone surged forward, squishing Ange. `
`They tried tossing her into the air, but dropped her onto her butt, and everyone laughed. `
`Ange looked a bit resentful, but when her brother lent her a hand, she got up and joined the circle of smiles... `
`A quiet applause greeted them. `
`{f:5:Featherine}, their witness, had acknowledged their victory and was clapping for them. `
`"...Splendidly done, `
`Lady {f:5:Ange Beatrice}. `
`...In celebration of this miracle, I bestow upon you the title of Lady. `
`The tale you weaved was quite entertaining." `
`"............" `
`"There is no need to be so hostile. `
`I am congratulating you." `
`{f:5:Featherine} smiled serenely. `
`Then, the cat overlords broke their positions in their constellation and lined up behind her. `
`It was clear that this was not only a peaceful action, but part of a solemn ceremony. `
`"You have defeated my miko. `
`And I thank you for sparing her life. `
`......As you can see, she was my cute pet cat, who never ceased to save me from boredom. `
`If she died, boredom would overcome me as well." `
`The true strength of this being, who referred to {f:5:Bernkastel} as a pet cat, had already been made clear during her fight with {f:5:Lambdadelta}. `
`Even so, Ange spoke. `
`"...I...won't forgive you for killing {f:5:Lambdadelta}." `
`"My, that doesn't sound like the words of a Witch of Resurrection. `
`Can you not revive her whenever you wish?" `
`"Huh? `
`I can revive her...?!" `
`"It's okay! `
`I'm sure that Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} has been revived somewhere, thanks to your power. There's no need to worry." `
`"Indeed. `
`She has already been moved to the audience seating I prepared for her. `
`Do not fear. `
`I shall take good care of her." `
`"Really?! `
`That's...wonderful..." `
`Ange finally relaxed and let the tension leave her whole body. `
`"Well now. `
`...Battler, `
`you are now the sole Game Master of your final game." `
`"......True. `
`That cat of yours looks like she's out of the running." `
`"Perhaps you should carry on with the final ceremony of your game... `
`...My miko is as forgetful as a cat, but she can sometimes be as persistent as one. `
`I suggest getting it over with quickly." `
`"......Yeah. `
`...Okay, I'll follow your advice there." `
`"I shall be your witness and record a detailed account of it all." `
`"The final...ceremony... `
`...So, even this game...is about to end." `
`Battler nodded silently. `
`Then, he stepped out from the crowd and motioned for Ange to follow him. `
`As Ange passed by each member of the Ushiromiya family, they cheered her on, giving her words of encouragement. `
`Battler took out the golden key and handed it to Ange. `
`It now had the same glint it had possessed when he had first given it to her. `
`Then, two doors appeared out of thin air on either side of them. `
`They had a stately design, ...making the importance of this choice clear. `
`"...Am I supposed to pick one without any hints?" `
`"Of course not. `
`I'll give you a hint. `
`By now, it should be an easy puzzle. `
`A simple puzzle with two answers. `
`And you'll choose your answer by opening one of the doors." `
`"I see... `
`Okay. `
`So, this is a continuation of that Halloween party. `
`I fell asleep during that party, didn't I? `
`I'm glad to finally wrap that up properly." `
`"Beato, `
`come forward." `
`"*cackle*cackle* `
`After all, you fell asleep before you got to my puzzle. `
`I'm glad I now have a chance to tell it." `
`"Sorry about that. `
`It sounds like it'll be pretty tough." `
`"Uryu-! `
`You'll be fine, Ange!" `
`"Kihihihihihi, I wonder about that." `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`Prepare yourself. It's a tough one!" `
`"...Calm down, Ange. `
`It's an easy puzzle. `
`......Don't you remember the first thing your brother told you, ...about how to choose the best possible option...?" `
`"........." `
`"Battler, you're giving too many hints. `
`This is the triumphant return of Lady {f:5:Ange}, Witch of the Future. `
`All you have to do is watch over her." `
`"...True. `
`Then I'll hand it over to Beato. `
`...I'm counting on you." `
`"Indeed. `
`......Then let us begin." `
`"...O-Okay." `
`Ange gulped, then stared up at the witch's face. `
`The witch held out her {p:42:left hand}, bringing it close to Ange's face. `
`Then, she slowly spread her fingers. `
`"Look carefully at my palm. `
`I'm not hiding anything, correct?" `
`"...Yeah. `
`There's nothing there." `
`"Watch closely. `
`I'll make a fist, `
`...and then stretch out my index finger." `
`She stretched out her index finger and held it right in front of Ange's eyes. `
`"Watch the tip of my finger closely. `
`Ready? It'll be fast." `
`The witch rapidly lifted her index finger high into the air, pointing at the heavens. `
`Just as Ange looked up to see the finger raised high, it swung down as though trying to dodge her gaze. `
`In that manner, `
`...up, `
`down, `
`left, `
`right, `
`then left again, as though Ange was playing a game of Acchi Muite Hoi. `
`Ange, feeling as though she'd lose if she couldn't keep up with the fingertip, swung her face this way and that, looking serious. `
`The witch's hand moved faster and faster. `
`Ange didn't lose track of it. `
`Then, after the high pointing finger was swung down all of a sudden, `
`...the index finger curled up again, and the hand was held in a simple fist. `
`"............" `
`"Ready? `
`I'm going to open my hand..." `
`The witch slowly opened her {p:42:right fist}...... `
`And there......was a cutely wrapped candy. `
`"Got it?" `
`"Yeah." `
`"Was this a trick or magic? `
`That is my puzzle for you." `
`"Go ahead, Ange. `
`...Give your answer. `
`Is this a trick or magic...?" `
`I...know. `
`I know what the answer is. `
`"If your answer is "magic", open this door. `
`If it's "a trick", then open that door." `
`I had already decided upon my answer. `
`"This is my answer." `
`I walked over to the door that represented the answer I had chosen. `
`Then, I put the golden key into the keyhole...and turned to face everyone. `
`"The Ushiromiya eagle never looks back." `
`"...That's right. `
`Sorry." `
`I gripped the key tightly and twisted. `
`Then, the key and the door flashed brilliantly...and slowly faded away. `
`Beyond the door...was a strangely-colored space. `
`If I step into this, ...I'll reach the future I chose. `
`Before taking that single step, ...I spoke without turning back. `
`"The Ushiromiya eagle never turns back. `
`...So I won't turn around, but I'll say this! `
`Thank you, everyone. `
`But this isn't goodbye! `
`I'll always be with you all!!" `
`"Yeah. `
`You won't turn back. `
`But we'll always be standing behind you." `
`"...That's not what I mean!! `
`Despite it all, I still believe. `
`I'm positive...that everyone will come back!!" `
`"......Ange..." `
`"That is good. `
`...Ange, `
`I look forward to the day when we all meet again." `
`"Ange, my adorable granddaughter. `
`We may be away for some time. `
`...Here, don't forget this. `
`It's your prize from that quiz party." `
`A gold butterfly flew over my shoulder, landed on my palm, and turned into a scrubbing brush. `
`A gold butterfly flew over my shoulder, landed on my palm, and turned into a can of mackerel. `

`A gold butterfly flew over my shoulder, landed on my palm, and turned into a {f:5:Beatrice} doll. `
`"......This was lying next to me when I woke up on the sofa, wasn't it? `
`......This was...my prize." `
`"Take it back to the future with you, and treasure it." `
`"Thanks, ...everyone." `
`"......Maybe I should've taken this a bit more seriously." `
`I...took a step forward. `
`Forward...into the future. `
`{a:c:I won't say goodbye. `
`{n}So, see you later. `
`{n}We'll always be together.} `
`The wind brushed against my cheek. `
`I slowly opened my shut eyes. `
`...I must have had my eyes closed for a very long time. `
`Even the sparkles below me...seemed blindingly bright. `
`...It was a strange world, with a sea of stars beneath me. `
`The wind was cold. `
`...However, it told me that I had returned to reality. `
`I was standing with one foot outstretched......over that starry sea. `
`How long have I been here? `
`...Time has probably been stopped for me ever since Bern lured me forward, ... `
`when I was about to take that step off the edge. `
`"........." `
`I slowly......pulled my foot back in. `
`Then, I leaned against the fence and sat down. `
`The sky...was far away. `
`But so was the ground. `
`This whole time, I've been in this sad place, so far from both of those worlds. `
`I can't...go to the sky. `
`In that case, I have to return to my world. `
`"And the elevator is probably the way to go. `
`...I've done enough skydiving. `
`...Yeah, there really is no chance. `
`No chance of me jumping down from here and surviving by some miracle." `
`Some Witch of Miracles has already guaranteed with certainty that such a miracle won't occur, after all. `
`Then, I finally noticed them. `
`It was the guards President Okonogi had assigned to me. `
`They were approaching the fence with forced smiles and sweat dripping down their faces, trying not to startle me. `
`That's right. `
`I gave these guys the slip before jumping off, didn't I? `
`"......Did you think I was going to jump?" `
`"W-Well, that's...umm......" `
`"...Sorry. `
`If I jumped, I guess you'd really catch it from Okonogi-san." `
`"Ange-san, ...it's dangerous there. `
`For now, please come back to this side..." `
`"Let me stay here a bit longer. `
`......It's okay. `
`I won't get any sudden ideas. `
`Do any of you have a cell phone?" `
`"Y-Yes..." `
`"I want to talk to Okonogi-san about something. `
`Would you mind calling him?" `
`The guards looked at each other, then rushed to take out their cell phones. `
`They were worried that I might get annoyed and jump off, leaving them to take the blame. `
`"...Th-The president has picked up... `
`......Here..." `
`"Thanks. `
`...Hello, Okonogi-san? `
`......Yeah. `
`Sorry for calling all of a sudden. `
`No, it's excellent news. `
`A bit of an early Christmas present. `
`...I'm giving all of the Ushiromiya group to you. `
`......That's right. `
`In exchange, I have a few things I want." `
`As she gazed down at the sea of stars spread out on the ground below her, Ange spoke. `
`She spoke of how she would live from now on. `
`......Ushiromiya Ange's `
`strange and mysterious adventure...ends here. `
`But my life will continue. `
`After all, there's already something for me to do. `
`I am {f:5:Ange Beatrice}, witch of Mariage Sorcière. `
`"Ushiromiya Ange just fell from here and died. `
`...I am the witch, {f:5:Ange}. `
`...I'll live. `
`As a witch." `
`"And so, your game ends." `
`As Ange opened the door and vanished from sight, ...the residents of the Golden Land disappeared as well. `
`Afterwards, only Battler could still be seen. `
`He had now done everything he could for Ange... `
`"...Close the door. `
`...Wasn't there some rule to be followed when closing this door?" `
`"Yes, that's right. `
`...The rule said that you needed two people to close it." `
`"Hey, Aunt {f:5:Eva}." `
`"I told you to stop talking to me like I'm an old lady!" `
`The two of them stood to the left and right of the door that Ange had vanished through. `
`"Ange, `
`...find happiness in your future." `
`"After all, we'll always be with you." `
`Then, the two of them held their hands out in front of them. `
`As they did, a door popped into existence and closed. `
`Then, the door itself faded away... `
`"...And now, we have completed our role." `
`"Yeah. `
`...This marks the end of the pieces' purpose." `
`"You have worked hard, both of you. `
`...And with this, I shall clean up your game board and put it away." `
`Slowly, ...the world melted. `
`At a glance, it looked as though the City of Books was starting to fall apart. `
`But that wasn't it. `
`Battler and {f:5:Eva}'s world...was being cut off from the City of Books. `
`The world broke apart bit by bit, and the ceiling would probably fall in soon. `
`"This is goodbye, `
`Battler-kun." `
`"Yeah. `
`...See you later. And, someday, `
`I'll leave Ange in your hands, Aunt Eva." `
`"At least at the end, try calling me {f:5:Eva} onee-san, would you?" `
`"............" `
`"See you later, Erika. `
`Somewhere, someday." `
`"......Both Ange and I were Witches of Truth. `
`...So...just what was the difference between us?" `
`"......Yeah, what could it be?" `
`"I...was a witch who endured and withstood the truth, `
`...but I turned my back on that truth. `
`...However, even after she learned the truth, she continued to believe in her own truth. `
`......If she was a true Witch of Truth, `
`...then what kind of witch was I?" `
`"That's right. `
`......You...aren't a witch." `
`"............" `
`"After all, you're the detective." `
`"......... `
`......<Good>. `
`...I'd forgotten." `
`"We'll meet again, someday. `
`...Wherever there's a crime, the detective's sure to be there, right?" `
`"Yes. `
`When another crime occurs in the Ushiromiya family, `
`I promise to appear." `
`"So long, great detective." `
`"So long, my rival. `
`I look forward to the day when the two of us can cross blades again." `
`Those...were the final words the two ever spoke to each other. `
`A terrible roar and a cloud of dust blew by, covering everything. `
`...And then, everything vanished. `
`Nothing remained. `
`Battler and {f:5:Eva} were both gone. `
`The City of Books was wrapped in silence. `
`"......It's all...over." `
`"Yes, `
`Great Lady {f:5:Aurora}." `
`"...Take care of my pet cat. `
`...Now, I shall go too. `
`There are some things that must be cleaned up in this world as well." `
`When Hachijo made her announcement, `
`everyone fell silent, thinking they had misheard her. `
`Before too long though, the crowd exploded with a shower of questions about what she meant by this. `
`"Th-That's...too cruel...!!" `
`"You can't do that after dragging us along this far!!" `
`"Madam Hachijo, we have come from far and wide to see it, yes?! `
`How can you...do this now?!!" `
`"......I will say it again. `
`I've changed my mind. `
`Ushiromiya Eva's diary will not be made public." `
`"A-A fraud, this is all a fraud...!!" `
`"Was it really Ushiromiya Eva's diary? `
`Are you sure it wasn't a fabrication you created?!" `
`"You think you can get away with something like this?!! `
`Show us the book!!!" `
`"Children of men can be so hideous. `
`...Neither you nor I have the right to read what lies in there. `
`...However, now that I think of it, this has been quite an entertaining show. `
`Children of men who disturb the sleep of the dead and spread rumors for their own entertainment can be quite amusing, at times like this. `
`......Let us go, Bern. `
`I have had my share of entertainment for the night..." `
`A black cat jumped onto Hachijo's shoulder, `
`and she disappeared off to the side of the stage, the Book of the Single Truth in her arms. `
`Only the angry yells of the massive crowd remained... `
`And so, ...the people began to lose interest in Ushiromiya Eva's diary, `
`...doubting whether it had even truly existed. `
`Though the weekly magazines were in an uproar over the scam Hachijo Tohya had pulled, `
`some began to openly wonder if the Rokkenjima mystery itself was an indiscreet desecration of the dead. `
`I don't think a little thing like this will allow Rokkenjima to rest in peace. `
`However, it did create an atmosphere where people were slightly more hesitant to openly show interest in the Rokkenjima mystery. `
`An unopened cat box is eternal. `
`Rokkenjima will probably never find peace. `
`However, ......even so, compared to how it was before, ...life will surely be easier. `
`......Because, as the years pass, ...the dust will slowly pile up on it where it lies in the depths of oblivion. `
`At the bottom of the deep sea known as the depths of oblivion, ...the cat box of the witches will probably get slowly buried as the years pass. `
`{f:5:Featherine}...threw a single golden rose into that sea. `
`An offering to let the cat box rest in peace. `
`With the tale of that golden rose, ...let us mark the end of this long story. `
`In the darkness, there was a massive roar and an earthquake. `
`When it passed, ...dawn began to rise over the endless night... `
`"Where am I......?" `
`"We're in the wreckage of an old submarine base. `
`Don't you remember...?" `
`"It's where it all started." `
`"*cackle*cackle* `
`The place where we first met, two generations ago." `
`"Hahaha. `
`Sounds pretty romantic if you put it that way." `
`Battler and Beato...could be seen in the ruins of Rokkenjima's underground submarine base. `
`The cave's mouth opened to the sea, and the gentle sound of the waves drifted in along with the cries of the seagulls. `
`It seemed that the typhoon, which had closed off the island for two days, ...had finally gotten bored and gone away. `
`Beato went down to the shore and lifted up a large sheet. `
`Beneath it...was a motorboat. `
`Of course, it wasn't from the time of the war. `
`It was modern. `
`"Pile this up on the boat. `
`Careful, it's heavy." `
`"Whoa. `
`This is a gold ingot. `
`I thought they all got buried." `
`"I thought something like this might happen, `
`so I snuck this one out beforehand." `
`The single heavy gold ingot was dropped into the boat. `
`I'm not sure how much this is worth by itself, but it must be quite a lot. `
`"Have you ever driven a motorboat before?" `
`"You're joking, right?" `
`"It's easy. `
`I'll teach you." `
`She wasn't used to this, but after several mistakes, Beato finally got the engine started. `
`"If you go out that way and hop from island to island, you'll see Niijima before too long. `
`Then, you can just land on a sandy beach." `
`"...Aren't you coming?" `
`"I cannot. `
`...I am the master of the Golden Land. `
`I cannot leave this place." `
`"What's to be gained from staying?" `
`"What's to be gained from going?" `
`"Let's live." `
`"......I cannot. `
`I have already committed countless sins in countless worlds. `
`The number of lives I have taken, the number of sins I have committed...is far too great." `
`"But you haven't committed any sins in our world." `
`"No, ......that is not true." `
`"............" `
`"Go. `
`Go while I'm still in a good mood. `
`Otherwise, I may seal the island in a storm again." `
`Battler suddenly spun around. `
`When Beato turned around to see what was going on, her body was suddenly lifted into the air. `
`"Then `
`I'll take you back as a souvenir from the Golden Land." `
`"L-Let go...! `
`Th-This isn't safe...!!" `
`"C'mon, don't freak out. `
`Listen carefully, {f:5:Beatrice}." `
`"Wh-What...?" `
`"I'm going to kidnap you." `
`".........Ba..." `
`As Battler quietly gazed at her with serious eyes, Beato was lost for words. `
`"If you've sinned, `
`then I've sinned as well for making you do it. `
`...So, let's carry your cross together." `
`"...Battler......" `
`"As long as I live, `
`...I'll carry your cross. `
`...Let's leave the Golden Land. `
`You and me, together." `
`Beato was now too shocked to say anything at all. `
`Then, tears poured from her eyes, and she covered her face. `
`Battler gently set her down on the boat. `
`He undid the mooring ropes. `
`...Now, there was no longer anything tying this boat to the island. `
`"Let's go." `
`Controlling the boat as Beato had taught him, Battler slowly guided it out... `
`When they passed out of the dimly lit cavern, they were immediately struck by the bright rays of the sun and surrounded by a crowd of white seagulls. `
`As the seagulls flew this way and that, ...the feathers they dropped in the water seemed to celebrate the boat's departure. `
`The brilliant sunlight told them that they were now free of the island's curse. `
`...The sky, now freed from the seal of the typhoon, seemed too bright to be real. `
`Feeling hot, Battler took off his jacket. `
`...It was swept away by the wind and danced through the sky. `
`However, instead of panicking, Battler just smiled as he watched it go. `
`Beato also watched it go. `
`...No, she watched the island go. `
`Rokkenjima...and the Golden Land she had spent a thousand years in. `
`"Will I......be able to live...?" `
`"You will. `
`...You won't have a magical butler, but there's all sorts of useful stuff out there. `
`...There's no end to the things you couldn't find on Rokkenjima. `
`I'll...show you what the world's like." `
`"......Will I...be able to live...?" `
`Beato repeated the same words again. `
`Battler knew what she meant. `
`However, no matter what answer he gave, he wouldn't be able to resolve her problem now. `
`...However, there was a way to resolve it. `
`Time...and the heart. `
`Little by little, bit by bit. `
`Like a chain being cut by falling drops of water, ...he would have to sever the curse of the island gradually, ...over a long period of time. `
`It might take a long, long time. `
`However, someday, ...she will be free. `
`That's what I believe. `
`"I am a sinful witch, who toyed with hundreds of deaths on that island. `
`...Your world...is too brilliant for me." `
`"No, you will live." `
`I answered immediately and forcefully. `
`"If you think you need to atone for hundreds of sins, then keep on living and living. `
`Live as hard as you can, ...with everything you've got. `
`That's the only way you can atone." `
`"......Is that...truly the only way to atone for my sins?" `
`"That's right. `
`And you'll definitely be able to do it someday. `
`Trust me." `
`".........Battler......" `
`"Come on, don't look at me with those teary eyes. `
`It's embarrassing..." `
`"*cackle*cackle*... `
`Forgive me. `
`Then, at the very least, `
`...would you close your eyes?" `
`"...Wh-Why should I...? Hey, your face is pretty close..." `
`"Foolish man... `
`You ought to be cursed for taking the witch away from the Golden Land. `
`......That's why you must close your eyes. `
`...I-It's...embarrassing for me too." `
`As soon as Battler shut his eyes... `
`Soft lips...covered his. `
`Then, they slowly drew back. `
`He tried to open his eyes, but just got slapped. `
`"Don't look, I told you not to look at my face!!" `
`"C-Come on, what's there to lose...?!" `
`"You have no delicacy! `
`Don't open them, not yet!! `
`Why? `
`B-Because I want to kiss you again...!!" `
`The next kiss...was on his earlobe. `
`"H-Hey, quit it...! `
`Now this is getting really embarrassing...!" `
`He knew he'd get hit again if he opened his eyes, so he resisted with his eyes still shut. `
`Then, after sighing and tickling his ear, `
`Beato spoke in her usual cheerful, bullying voice. `
`"Sorry, Battler. `
`I'm a terrible, atrocious witch." `
`"Yeah, I know. `
`You're an evil, cruel witch." `
`"And so, I cannot atone for my sins. `
`After all, I'm the sort of witch who can cackle over hundreds of deaths...!" `
`"Y-You're really something, you know that...? `
`But you wouldn't be you otherwise." `
`He accidentally opened his eyes. `
`...And when he did, ...the witch was nowhere to be seen. `
`The Golden Witch had vanished...like a dream or an illusion. `
`...And...so had the single ingot they had carried with them. `
`A black luxury car was parked at the rear entrance of the skyscraper. `
`Men wearing suits were packing a heavy-looking attache case into its trunk. `
`"Let me handle all the rest. `
`We'll take care of all the complicated details." `
`"I'm counting on you. `
`Aunt Eva trusted you more than anyone, `
`so I'm sure she's glad this is all in your hands now." `
`Out of the building...came Ange and President Okonogi. `
`Ange's expression...was peaceful. `
`It was hard to imagine that this was the same person who had always looked so dark in Okonogi's eyes. `
`"...In her later years, the company president was very ill. `
`I imagine that she said some fairly harsh things to you, `
`...but I don't believe she truly meant them." `
`"I know. `
`Even I said things I shouldn't have on my bad days." `
`".........You've changed." `
`"You think so?" `
`"...I thought you'd never forgive the president as long as you lived." `
`"You're the one who taught me, Okonogi-san." `
`"I did? `
`Did I say something?" `
`"Without love, the truth cannot be seen." `
`"Did I really say something that pretentious? `
`Hehhahahahahahahaha." `
`"It's been a long journey. `
`...It really has been a long journey, all just to understand what you told me that day." `
`Of course, Okonogi understood. `
`He understood that, in her heart, this had been a long and profound journey. `
`"Contact me when you decide on a new home and account. `
`I won't let you want for anything." `
`"Any problems with the Sumadera family?" `
`"Leave that to me. `
`We have your power of attorney as our rallying point. `
`Thanks to that, the Ushiromiya group is a united front. `
`...Because of what you did, Ange-chan, the business built by the former president has been protected. `
`I truly believe she'd be joyful at your decision." `
`"I'm just pushing all the hard stuff on you." `
`When the great President Ushiromiya Eva passed away, the Ushiromiya group was shaken. `
`There was no clear successor, so the group had been in danger of splitting. `
`After that, everyone had been waiting to hear what Ange would say, since she had inherited a large portion of the group's stock. `
`...However, Ange had shown no interest in any of this...and had gone around talking about things like selling all their assets and donating everything to some charity, `
`which had shaken the group even further. `
`There had even been a chance that an outsider, such as the Sumadera family, would interfere and destroy the Ushiromiya group. `
`As disturbing as it may seem, `
`some had wished for the source of all this trouble, Ange, to disappear... `
`...However, Ange had undergone a change of heart, deciding to do what was best for the Ushiromiya group that Eva had built up, `
`and the worst-case scenario had been avoided. `
`Okonogi had been named as Ange's legal guardian. `
`By simply giving him her trust, Ange now had in him the most reliable ally possible. `
`Okonogi himself had certain plans he could carry out based on the knowledge that Ange trusted him. `
`Okonogi, who had carried great responsibility in the Ushiromiya group thanks to his position as Eva's closest confidant, was the most natural choice to be Eva's successor for the top spot, `
`and thanks in part to his ability, everything had now been wrapped up smoothly. `
`This way, the Ushiromiya group was secure. `
`The Ushiromiya group had been the only thing still tied to the Ushiromiya name other than Ange herself, `
`so she might have thought of it as her final link to her family. `
`"You know, you're free to come back any time you want. `
`We have a chair set aside just for you." `
`"Thanks. `
`Just knowing I have a place to go back to...means I can set off on my journey in peace." `
`"What are you going to do from now on?" `
`"I'm going to become an author." `
`"An author? `
`To write novels?" `
`"It doesn't matter what. `
`It could be novels or picture books. `
`If I have any skill at drawing, maybe I'll do a manga. `
`...What I do doesn't matter. `
`As long as I can share my heart with someone." `
`"...Sounds like you've set a noble task for yourself. `
`I'll be praying for your success." `
`"Thanks. `
`If I manage to publish a book, I'll send you a copy." `
`"I look forward to it." `
`The car's trunk was closed with a clunk. `
`Apparently, all of her luggage had been loaded. `
`"Ah, yes, allow me to introduce you to the driver. `
`He's a protege of mine. `
`He's trustworthy, and you can rely on him for anything. `
`Oh, and he worked as a guard for the old president for many years, so you might recognize him." `
`"...As long as it isn't Amakusa." `
`Achoo! `
`The man walking out of the driver's seat sneezed. `
`"Now that hurts, Lady." `
`"Amakusa, what the hell have you done to her?" `
`"...Well, he was always the most flippant of Aunt Eva's guards. `
`I was hoping for pretty much anyone else." `
`"But he was also the one closest to you, wasn't he?" `
`"...Well, at least listening to him talk can be pretty entertaining." `
`"The boss assigned me to be his contact with you. `
`If you ever get into any sort of trouble, just let me know." `
`"And what if I ask you to go buy me toilet paper?" `
`"Then I'll pick up some tampons too while I'm out." `
`"...See? `
`The guy's a creep." `
`Okonogi guffawed. `
`I got into the back seat. `
`"Stay well, `
`Ange-chan." `
`"I guess this is the last time anyone will call me by that name." `
`"Let me know when you've decided on a new one." `
`Okonogi patted the roof of the car. `
`At that signal, Amakusa honked the horn and removed the hand brake... `
`"So, until you've decided on a new name, I guess I'll be calling you Lady." `
`"That's fine for now." `
`"...Okay. `
`Where are we going? `
`North? South?" `
`"......Any recommendations?" `
`"Why don't we try leaving the main island? `
`I'd suggest Hokkaido. `
`...Huge meadows, giant clouds! `
`A novelist writing stories in a log cabin... Sounds awesome." `
`"Great, let's head south. `
`...I was planning to do the opposite of whatever you said anyway." `
`"Heheh, that's pretty harsh." `
`"I'd like to go someplace hot. `
`A town with a view of the sea." `
`Ange closed her eyes. `
`Things had been pretty crazy lately, and she was tired... `
`"Understood. `
`By the time you open your eyes, we'll be in an unfamiliar land. `
`...But it'll be a warm town with a view of the sea." `
`"Can't wait to see... `
`what you choose." `
`The car got onto the freeway. `
`It was surrounded by the great river of cars heading east and west. `
`By now, no one could tell which of those points was the car she rode in. `
`Starting today, Ushiromiya Ange would change her name and live in a new climate. `
`Changing her name didn't mean that she had given up on being Ange. `
`This was Ange's... `
`No, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}'s mission. `
`{a:c: `
`I am {f:5:Ange Beatrice}.} `
`{a:c: `
`The Golden and Endless Witch of Resurrection. `
`A witch of Mariage Sorcière.} `
`{a:c: `
`The final witch, who is still alive in the future called 1998......} `
`A strong wind blew through my hair. `
`My nose was filled with the smell of the sea. `
`...I must have been standing still for a very long time. `
`This is...a point cutting through the sea. `
`I was standing on the bow of a boat. `
`I was still holding that thing. `
`"...Lady, `
`if you stand around there too long, you'll freeze." `
`"Amakusa...... `
`...So, this is..." `
`Captain Kawabata's face peered out at her. `
`"You can see it now. `
`That's the old Ushiromiya family dock." `
`"Whoo. `
`Not even a trace of it left." `
`"...I see. `
`...So, I've come back here. `
`It's been a really long daydream......no, a long and windy side trip." `
`No matter what sort of tales are woven or written about the past, `
`...they have nothing to do with my tale of the future. `
`I swore to live life looking only at the future, without turning back. `
`If swearing that has a purpose, then this hasn't all been just a daydream. `
`And besides, I've brought many things back with me from that long side trip. `
`Some of those are even immediately useful. `
`"...... `
`...But yeah, this isn't going to do me much good." `
`I threw the scrubbing brush into the ocean. `
`I threw the can of mackerel into the ocean. `
`I threw the memory foam pillow with the One‐winged Crest into the ocean. `
`I threw the old‐type white school swimsuit into the ocean. `
`I threw the fully ripe mango into the ocean. `
`I threw the decorative pine branch into the ocean. `
`I threw the uniform from Angel Mort into the ocean. `
`I threw the signed celebrity photograph of Kinzo into the ocean. `
`I threw the bag that laughs with Kinzo's voice into the ocean. `
`I threw the One‐winged Eagle carp streamer into the ocean. `
`I threw the bouquet of golden roses into the ocean. `
`I threw the music box that had been passed down through the generations into the ocean. `
`I threw the mass‐produced Sakutarou doll into the ocean. `
`I threw the tea set bearing the family crest into the ocean. `
`I threw the pocket watch bearing the family crest into the ocean. `
`I threw the {f:5:Beatrice} corsage into the ocean. `
`I threw the Battler doll into the ocean. `
`I threw the {f:5:Beatrice} doll into the ocean. `
`"...What was that?" `
`"My regrets. `
`...I've shed my old shell." `
`"So, with old Rokkenjima right in front of you, you're having a change of heart?" `
`"...That's not what I meant. `
`I mean I've had enough of being Human." `
`"?" `
`I won't waste that long journey. `
`I now have a new way to live. `
`And that isn't as the Human called Ushiromiya Ange. `
`I am...reborn. `
`"Captain, `
`sorry, but would you mind leaving for a second?" `
`"Hmm? `
`Sure, whatever you say." `
`Captain Kawabata went down into the driver's area. `
`"...What is it, Lady? `
`Why the troubled face?" `
`"I feel like taking a step into a new life." `
`"You already have." `
`"True. `
`...If I could sell off all the Ushiromiya family wealth that's burdening me, maybe donating it to some charity, that would be a huge relief. `
`Then, I'd finally be able to escape from the shell called Ushiromiya Ange." `
`"...... `
`...It seems a waste of all that money. You could do anything you wanted with it." `
`"Who cares? `
`My point is that I don't need it." `
`"......That may be true. `
`...Then again, not everything that you'd be selling off belongs to you exclusively. `
`...For example..." `
`"Are you talking about the Ushiromiya group's stock?" `
`"...That's right. `
`They may be little more than scraps of paper to you, `
`but doing something like that could shatter the whole company... `
`I don't think my boss could bear to have that happen." `
`"Yeah, I know. `
`It's like that for the Sumaderas and President Okonogi alike. `
`There are plenty of people who're in a tough spot because I can do as I please." `
`"......There's no doubt that you're a VIP, Ange-san. `
`Wouldn't it be better to chill out and hide away for now, and just hold off on doing anything flashy...?" `
`"What would be the fastest and most convenient way to prevent this VIP from doing as she pleases, I wonder?" `
`"...Hey, that's a good question...! `
`Well, we could break out the drinks, tell each other our deepest secrets, and..." `
`"Anyone could guess that the final destination of my journey is Rokkenjima. `
`And, right now, Rokkenjima is completely uninhabited. `
`...There's no one there. `
`No one to see or to hear. `
`This is the perfect day for a closed room." `
`"......Well, yeah, that may be true." `
`"The Sumadera family is chasing me. `
`They even managed to barge into President Okonogi's building with perfect timing. `
`...Someone leaked the fact that I was there." `
`"Are you saying my boss sold you out? `
`...Then why would he give you a bodyguard?" `
`"Since he doesn't know what sort of whims I'm going to act on, `
`President Okonogi wants to have both the Sumadera family and me indebted to him. `
`That way, he can sell information about me, let me slip away by a hair, and keep track of my whereabouts, putting both me and the Sumadera family in his debt while keeping a trump card in his hand." `
`"You're definitely overthinking things there..." `
`Amakusa wore a forced smile, trying to smooth things over. `
`"We can be sure that the Sumadera family is chasing me. `
`My actions are being intentionally leaked to them." `
`"Then, we'll bump into each other on Rokkenjima. `
`I will be killed by them. `
`After that, you will kill the Sumadera hit men, `
`and President Okonogi will have a trump card to use in negotiations with the Sumaderas. `
`...If I die, the Ushiromiya group will be stable for the time being. `
`Plus, they'll be able to draw the line with the Sumadera family. `
`On the other side, the Sumadera family itself will be able to neatly do away with Aunt Kasumi, the leader of their overenthusiastic radical faction. `
`...Both sides will finish their bargaining with a draw, and everyone'll be happy." `
`"............Whew. `
`...That's a pretty interesting story you've thought up there." `
`"That golf bag you brought with you... `
`I've had a look at what's inside. `
`Are you planning to start a war or something with all those guns? `
`...But it had a sniper rifle in it. `
`Would a bodyguard who's always by my side really need something like that?" `
`"Well, you never know what might happen..." `
`"Why would a bodyguard, who works best when traveling light, `
`choose to abandon his position for a whole day to get a gun like that, and right before we leave for Rokkenjima?" `
`"......Lady, `
`...you're over-thinking this, okay...?" `
`"When I reach Rokkenjima, `
`...you'll suggest that I go visit the place they died or something, getting me on my own. `
`That's the bait. `
`The bait to lure in Sumadera Kasumi and the others waiting for me on Rokkenjima. `
`After that, you'll use that ridiculously huge gun to round them up. The end." `
`"...Well, what's wrong with rounding them up? `
`Isn't that what a guard's supposed to do?" `
`"In addition to a cutting-edge sniper rifle, you also had a modern German submachine gun." `
`"Those are really handy. `
`No matter how many people the Sumaderas have, I could clean them all up, no trouble..." `
`"There was one more. `
`A handgun. `
`...Even though the sniper rifle and the submachine gun were the best and the newest models, the handgun alone was beat up and old-fashioned. `
`See?" `
`Ange...pulled the handgun out and pointed it at Amakusa. `
`"...C-Cut it out. `
`This isn't funny..." `
`"A handgun is something you're always supposed to have on your person, right? `
`So, why would you go get a second handgun...and such an unusually old one? `
`One theory can explain this. `
`...What if...it's the same kind of gun Sumadera Kasumi and the others are using?" `
`"This is a Tokarev. `
`A gun once used by the Soviet military and which has gotten pretty popular in the Japanese underground. `
`It's exactly the sort of weapon the Sumaderas might be using. `
`...Also, having Sumadera Kasumi die would be convenient for the Sumadera family as well. `
`They could have leaked...no, exchanged information on their end as well. `
`Therefore, it's possible that you knew beforehand that the Sumadera hit men would be using Tokarevs." `
`Amakusa was speechless. `
`Was he speechless because this was all true, or because he was stunned by the determination with which Ange pointed that gun at him? `
`"The plan that you... `
`...no, the plan that all of you made together... `
`It was to use me as bait to lure Sumadera Kasumi to an uninhabited island, setting it up so that both sides appear to finish each other off... `
`That way, everything would be settled nice and neat for both President Okonogi and the Sumadera family." `
`"............" `
`A single line of cold sweat dripped down Amakusa's forehead... `
`With the wind whipping through her hair, Ange spoke coldly. `
`"...Just by the presence of this handgun, `
`see how far Ushiromiya Ange's reasoning has taken her. `
`What do you think, everyone...?" `
`"......You haven't taken the safety off." `
`"I know. `
`...Tokarevs don't have a safety." `
`Amakusa tried to dive behind cover, but he couldn't outrun a bullet. `
`It shot into his gut, making him double over in pain. `
`Ange, who knew that he had a gun hidden in his pocket, then eliminated his chances of a counterattack. `
`Blood spurted from Amakusa's forehead, and he did not close his eyes again. `
`"......There's a perfect, certain way to confirm someone's death without a doctor, and it's the easiest one in the world." `
`"...Y-You......!" `
`Kawabata stuck his head out, and his face went pale when he saw the gruesome scene on the deck. `
`This time, Ange pointed the barrel of the gun at his forehead. `
`"Before we left, you said you needed a bit more time to get the boat ready. `
`However, if you've been bought, `
`then we can say for sure that you were buying time so that Sumadera Kasumi could set up her ambush on Rokkenjima." `
`"......I-I have no idea what you're talking about...!!" `
`"You're a cat box, inside of which is a Kawabata who was bought and betrayed me...and a Kawabata who hasn't betrayed me. `
`...Now then, how can I kill the one who betrayed me?" `
`"S-Stop...!! `
`Don't shoot...!!" `
`"I just have to shoot the whole cat box to death." `
`The boat's owner slumped over backwards...and fell. `
`Then, with a second bullet, she performed a perfect examination of his corpse. `
`She had...survived. `
`Surely, ...she had survived the web-like conspiracy that had been wrapped around her so cleverly. `
`...Ange returned to the bow of the boat, faced the strong winds head on, and peered into the future in front of her. `
`The boat whose owner was gone...headed towards the endless horizon, on and on in a straight line. `
`She prayed that the truth she truly desired to reach lay before her. `
`Then, ...she heard the sound of clapping. `
`The sound of clapping, on a boat where Amakusa and the captain were no more. `
`However, Ange didn't look surprised. `
`She calmly and slowly turned around. `
`"Splendid reasoning, comrade Ange. `
`My fellow Witch of Truth, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}." `
`"...Oh, you're here, Erika." `
`"Anytime someone wants to expose the truth, you'll find me there. `
`*giggle*giggle*." `
`"Hey, Erika." `
`"What...?" `
`The boat had already passed by Rokkenjima. `
`The island's silhouette was now off in the distance. `
`The boat headed towards the endless horizon, ...continuing on its endless journey. `
`The new Witch of Truth announced the beginning of this endless journey to her fellow witch. `
`"......I'll carve out my future in my own way." `
`"Sounds splendid." `
`"At the end, ...will there be a truth for me to find?" `
`"Just what sort of truth could you be looking for, after all this?" `
`"............" `
`"............" `
`"......Hmph. `
`...You're right. `
`I know that the truth isn't worth anything. `
`And there's one more thing I've figured out." `
`"What's that?" `
`"That bewildered look on Amakusa's face when his scheme was exposed. `
`That was pretty good." `
`"*giggle*!" `
`""<Good>!"" `
