`"The day after Christmas isn't Christmas. `
`It couldn't happen." `
`"Heheheh. `
`Too bad. Wrong." `
`"Huh? Why...?!" `
`"Ange-chan, what time of day does a new day start?" `
`"Midnight, at 12:00 AM." `
`"There you go. `
`Isn't it nighttime at midnight?" `
`"...Ah." `
`I see. `
`The first night was just after midnight on December 25th. `
`In other words, the time right after the previous day ended and Christmas began. `
`That would indeed be Christmas Day, and it would be at night. `
`"And then, the morning of the 25th would come, and when the sun sank again, that would be nighttime on the 25th again..." `
`"Exactly! `
`You figured it out." `
`"Hohoho! `
`If only you had figured it out a little faster." `
`Grandfather laughed like Santa Claus. `
`Aunt Eva asked him to count it as a right answer, since I figured it out in the end, but Grandfather shook his head. `
`"Come on...! `
`Don't be such a stingy Grandpa." `
`"Still, now I've figured out how to do it. `
`I'll get the next one right." `
`"Yes, yes. `
`That's the spirit. `
`That's my granddaughter for you." `
`"Thank you, Grandpa! `
`I'm really ready now. `
`I'll start getting a lot of them right!" `
`"Yes. `
`Give it your all. `
`I have a truly splendid present waiting for you." `
`After bowing to Grandfather, I hurried off with Aunt Eva to where everyone else was gathered. `
`"Oh, I see. `
`It is possible...!" `
`"Yeah, that's right. `
`After all, there are two nights in every day." `
`"Right! `
`December 25th starts at 12:00 midnight. `
`Midnight is during the night, so that's the first night. `
`Then, morning comes, and when night falls again, it's still the same day until midnight!" `
`"Exactly. `
`And both of those nights are nights on Christmas Day." `
`"Heheheheh. `
`Am I awesome? Am I awesome...?!" `
`With a delighted smile, Aunt Eva patted my head vigorously. `
`"Wahahaha! `
`Well done, Ange. `
`I tried to make it a hard question, but you solved it like it was nothing." `
`"Congratulations, Ange-sama. `
`...Here is a medal for getting the first question right." `
`Genji-san held out a gold-colored medal. `
`Grandfather smiled at me, urging me to take it. `
`"Th-Thank you!" `
`"Keep up the pace. `
`Well now, that is all for my puzzle. `
`Head over there and ask whomever you choose for a quiz." `
`It was a heavy, gold-colored medal. `
`If I get a lot of these right, my pocket might burst. `
`I'm gonna get so many that I can brag about it to everyone! `
`After bowing to Grandfather, `
`I hurried off with Aunt Eva to where everyone else was gathered. `
`Kinzo watched Ange go `
`with a warm gaze. `
`"Did I make it a bit too easy...?" `
`"No. `
`I think it was just right." `
`"......Genji, `
`have I...managed to act the part of a good grandpa...?" `
`"Of course." `
`"Ange is young. `
`And, she frequently grows sick and is unable to come to Rokkenjima. `
`...She probably won't...remember me well." `
`Young children have their own kind of cruelty. `
`They think of kindness as something they'll naturally receive. `
`And because they think of kindness as only natural, ...they forget about it quickly. `
`"...It is no different from gratitude to one's parents. `
`It will probably take Ange-sama many years before she understands." `
`"Do you think... `
`...she will eventually remember that I was a fun grandpa?" `
`"...Yes. `
`I am certain of it." `
`"..............." `
`Kinzo's expression grew slightly darker. `
`...Eventually, even Ange will get older, and she will probably hear how the public at large regards Ushiromiya Kinzo. `
`The Ushiromiya Kinzo known by the public is completely different from the Kinzo who plays with his grandchildren. `
`When she learns, `
`...will Ange remember the face of Kinzo the tyrant, known of by the world, ...or that gently smiling face? `
`"...I would hope for her to remember my smile, if possible, ...but such a thing is probably too much to ask for." `
`"............" `
`"There's no way around it. `
`That's what children are." `
`"Oh, it's you." `
`"Children just eat up kindness, and it never remains in their memories. `
`By the time 12 years have passed, she will surely learn what a bizarre eccentric Ushiromiya Kinzo was. `
`Your smile is fated to be painted over by that and forgotten." `
`"...Most probably. `
`No matter how much I spoil her, my love will not be rewarded." `
`"However, `
`just as it takes a long time to remember what you owe your parents, `
`...Ange will surely remember someday. `
`...She will remember the smiles you showed her." `
`"Hmph... `
`Let her forget. `
`One smile from her is the greatest parting gift I could ever take with me, when my time comes. `
`This is...the essence of unrewarded love." `
`"I guess grandfathers are always unrewarded." `
`"Oh, but I have been rewarded. `
`With Ange's smile just now to look back upon, `
`I could happily pass on in my sleep tonight. `
`Wahhahahahahahahaha..." `
`With a lonely laugh, Kinzo spun around, setting his cape fluttering. `
`This was all the love he could offer Ange as a grandfather. `
`Part of him wanted to be remembered, but he knew he mustn't wish for that. `
`That was...how unrewarded love worked. `
`After looking at Kinzo's back, Beato stared at Ange's back again. `
`"......Ange. `
`...Even so, please remember it someday. `
`...Remember the smile...that Kinzo once showed you." `
`Okay, whose quiz should I take next? `
`I'm gonna challenge more and more people, get more and more medals for getting them right, and get a wonderful present to show everyone. `
`Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi are over there. `
`They're looking this way and smiling. `
`I'm sure they've thought up some interesting puzzles. `
`There's Uncle Hideyoshi, beckoning for me to come over. `
`He's a fun uncle, so I'm sure he's thought up a fun question. `
`Mom and Dad are across from him. `
`They're waving at me, telling me to have lots of fun. `
`...Dad probably knows a lot of really hard questions. `
`He might be tough. `
`Over there is Aunt Rosa and Maria onee-chan. `
`It looks like they're reading a quiz book together, searching for a problem. `
`Every now and then, Maria onee-chan glances over at me, saying "kihihihihi". `
`She can be mean sometimes, so I'm sure her puzzle won't be a nice one. `
`Beyond them are Battler onii-chan, George onii-chan, and Jessica onee-chan. `
`...Battler onii-chan is usually nice, `
`but he sometimes says really mean things, and I think he likes seeing me get confused. `
`...I get the feeling... `
`that he'll give me a really tough problem. `
`Is there anyone who looks like they won't be mean? `
`If I can, I'd like to start with some easy puzzles to warm me up. `
`All the way over there are Genji-san and Doctor Nanjo. `
`I don't think those two will be mean to me. `
`And then there's Shannon and Kanon. `
`Shannon knows about a lot of quizzes and fairy tales. `
`I'm sure she'll give me something unique. `
`Then, we have Gohda-san and Kumasawa-san, who are serving tea. `
`Kumasawa-san might be tough. `
`...I kinda think she'll give me a really confusing problem. `
`...It looks like everyone might be pretty tough. `
`Hmmmmm... `
`"Ange-chan, `
`I've got a good one for ya...! `
`Over here!" `
`Uncle Hideyoshi is calling for me. `
`...What should I do? `
`Should I go? `
`"Do you want to try Uncle Hideyoshi?" `
`"Yeah. `
`The order doesn't matter. `
`After all, I'm gonna challenge everyone." `
`I rolled up my sleeves and headed towards Uncle Hideyoshi. `
`"Wahahahahahaha, here you are. `
`Mine's a tricky one, okay?" `
`"I wonder what sort of question you'll give her. `
`Don't make it too hard, okay?" `
`"It's okay if it's hard. `
`I'll solve it." `
`"Oooh, lookin' pretty confident there...! `
`Okay, here it comes!" `
`After clearing his throat, Uncle Hideyoshi started telling his question... `
`"Mine's a riddle. `
`Listen closely, now. `
`You know the story of {c:86EF9C:Momotarou}, right?" `
`"The boy who floated down a river in a peach?" `
`"That's right. `
`But you know, one day, an apple floated down that river." `
`"An apple??" `
`"Yep! `
`And the next day, a butternut squash floated down it!" `
`"I hate butternut squash." `
`"And then, the next day, some cabbage floated down it! `
`And the next day, a dill pickle did. `
`And the next day, an eggplant floated by. `
`And the day after that, a fig did!" `
`"*giggle* `
`What a strange tale. `
`Did a greengrocer live upstream or something?" `
`"Okay, here's the question. `
`What floated down the river the next day?!" `
`"Huh...?!" `
`"I've got it. `
`Do you get it, Ange-chan?" `
`"I don't get it." `
`"Then I'll give you a hint. `
`There's a pattern to the things that float down the river. `
`Can you guess what the pattern is?" `
`"Wahahahaha! `
`What a huge hint...!" `
`".........I don't...have a clue!" `
`"Wahhahahahahahahaha. `
`Guess that was a bit too hard...!" `
`"I know what floated down the river the day after that. `
`A hassaku orange, right?" `
`"Yep. `
`And the day after that, it was probably an i......i... hmmm... `
`...I can't think of a fruit or veggie that starts with "i"!" `
`I'm not sure I understand. `
`Ah well, too bad. `
`"I know! `
`It's a grapefruit!" `
`"That's right. `
`It wasn't one of the choices, but green beans would have worked too." `
`The names all followed the alphabet. `
`Apple was "a". `
`Butternut squash was "b". `
`Cabbage was "c". `
`It kept going with "d", "e", and "f". `
`So, after "f" comes "g". `
`That's why the answer had to be something that started with "g". `
`"Thanks, Aunt Eva. I got it right thanks to your hint!" `
`"*giggle* `
`You solved it by yourself, Ange-chan. `
`Incredible." `
`"Yep, nice work! `
`Now, here's your medal for gettin' it right...!" `
`Hideyoshi took out a gold-colored medal and placed it on my palm. `
`It felt heavy in my hand. `
`Yeah, this is what victory feels like. `
`I'd better keep it up! `
`"I've got another medal for Eva's puzzle. `
`But I can't think of any more." `
`"Then maybe I should give Ange-chan a puzzle." `
`"Huh? `
`You will?" `
`"Sure. `
`How about a quiz for the princess from her attendant{p:0:♪} `
`I've thought of a fun one, so please, have a go at it!" `
`Aunt Eva smiled brightly. `
`I want to get as many medals as possible, so of course, I want as many chances as I can get. `
`"Okay, I'll have a go at it." `
`"*giggle* That's the spirit. `
`Okay, here it comes." `
`"We've talked about how I love to travel, haven't we?" `
`"Yeah. `
`You said you like traveling overseas a lot." `
`"That's right. `
`So this will be a puzzle about traveling. `
`There was a traveler in a certain place." `
`"A traveler?" `
`"First, the traveler walked five kilometers north." `
`"...Should I write this down on a piece of paper?" `
`"Don't worry. `
`The puzzle isn't that hard, so listening to it will be enough." `
`"The traveler first walked five kilometers north. `
`Then, he walked five kilometers to the east. `
`Then, he walked five kilometers to the south." `
`"......Five kilometers north. `
`Five kilometers east. `
`Five kilometers south. `
`...You mean, like a blocky "n"?" `
`"That's right! `
`So, he'd end up at a spot five kilometers to the east of where he started." `
`"That's what you'd think, right? `
`But, incredibly, this traveler ended up in the exact same spot he started. `
`...Is something so mysterious possible?" `
`"Wahaha, there's no way! `
`His compass must've gone crazy." `
`"Of course it didn't! `
`Heheheheh, do you know, Ange-chan?" `
`"It wasn't because of his compass? `
`...Is this a play on words?" `
`"No, this is a real quiz. `
`For a hint, why don't you try thinking about a globe?" `
`"............I don't get it." `
`I've never traveled overseas at all. `
`There might be some strange place in the world where you could walk in a blocky "n" and get back to where you started. `
`...Like the Bermuda Triangle, or something... `
`"Hmmm... `
`I guess that was a bit too hard for you, Ange-chan." `
`"If you went north, then east, then south, there's no way you'd get back to where you started." `
`"But there is a place. `
`A place somewhere on the Earth's surface. `
`If you have a globe in your house, take a good look at it and think carefully. `
`If you just can't figure it out, try asking your dad, okay?" `
`"Okay, I'll ask him. `
`So tell me the right answer...!" `
`"*giggle* `
`The right answer is a veeery cold place. `
`Where can you find cold places on a globe? `
`Think about it carefully. `
`Once you figure it out, you can try giving this quiz to the other kids in your class. `
`I'm sure they'll all be surprised." `
`Where can you find a cold place? `
`...Hokkaido? `
`I don't think you end up at the start if you go north, east, then south in Hokkaido. `
`...Nnnn. `
`I don't get it. `
`I give up. `
`"Okay, that's all for our puzzles! `
`Go ask one of the others to give you one!" `
`"Let's go! `
`Who should we challenge next?!" `
`If Aunt Eva knows puzzles this hard, I'm sure she must be good at quizzes. `
`If she's with me, I know we'll get lots and lots of medals. `
`Who will I ask next...?! `
`"I got it...! `
`It's a really cold place! `
`Yeah, it must be incredibly cold there!" `
`"Perfect! `
`Ange-chan, you must really be a genius, to get something like that at your age." `
`"If you start at the south pole, then after you go north, goin' east just draws a circle around the south pole. `
`So, anytime you head south again, that just takes you right back to the south pole." `
`"I tried to make it an extra hard puzzle, `
`but Ange-chan was just too good." `
`"Congrats! `
`Here's another medal for ya." `
`I got a heavy, gold-colored medal. `
`All right, I did it...! `
`Aunt Eva and I held up our fists in celebration. `
`"Okay, that's all for our puzzles! `
`Go ask one of the others to give you one!" `
`"Okay! Thank you, Uncle Hideyoshi...!" `
`"Your aunt's really clever...! `
`...With the two of you together, you'll be gettin' medals right and left!" `
`"Yep, that's right!" `
`"Yeah. `
`Let's do our best together, Aunt Eva." `
`I dashed away. `
`Who will I ask next...?! `
`Uncle Hideyoshi waved goodbye, smiling... `
`Hideyoshi and Eva watched as Ange ran off happily, `
`looking for the next quiz. `
`"......Even though that kid can wear such a cute smile... `
`...I...will be the one who takes that away from her..." `
`"Eva......" `
`Eva hung her head. `
`A single tear sparkled in her eye... `
`"Her reaction was only natural, considering how she felt. `
`...But I...wasn't able to see past it and accept her feelings..." `
`"It can't be helped. `
`You're as human as anyone else. `
`Humans tend to be more fragile than you'd think." `
`"Even so, it was my fault...! `
`After all, I already had the experience of bringing up a child, right?! `
`...I should have become her mother. `
`...And yet, I let sadness overwhelm me, ...and I didn't do it at all..." `
`"It can't be helped, I tell you...! `
`Don't think you were the only one at fault...! `
`You shouldn't blame yourself so much!" `
`By now, Eva was unable to hold back her sobs... `
`Large tears dripped down her cheeks as she stared at the ground and shook... `
`"What a sin I've committed... `
`...My sadness was no greater than hers...! `
`And yet, I decided that I was suffering the most, ...so I didn't accept her feelings... `
`...I'm a failure of a mother... `
`I wasn't able...to become a mother for her..." `
`"That's wrong. `
`...You did your best for her, Eva nee-san." `
`"Kyrie-san..." `
`Kyrie and Rudolf were standing behind Eva now. `
`"I know the lengths you went to...to keep the truth from Ange." `
`"...You held out well, Aneki. `
`Guess that daughter of ours really has been a pain, and clueless about how much you suffered." `
`After the accident on Rokkenjima... `
`Eva, the only one who left Rokkenjima alive, adopted Ange, the girl who had been absent and survived. `
`...While they would eventually develop a sad and mutually painful relationship, `
`it wasn't like that at first. `
`Eva tried to show affection for Ange, her last remaining blood relative. She tried to become Ange's new mother. `
`Even as she fought back the sadness she herself felt. `
`However, Ange wasn't able to accept that kindness. `
`She lashed out at Eva, the only one who had returned alive, for stealing her parents away from her. `
`...Eva, understanding the wounds that this little six-year-old girl bore, withstood these attacks. `
`She grit her teeth and poured all of her affection onto Ange, ...affection that went ignored. `
`However, ...the wounds Eva herself bore were also extremely deep. `
`She was never rewarded for her sad efforts, `
`...and the future in front of her grew dark. `
`"You tried to show Ange the same affection you once showed George-kun." `
`"But that...was just for my own satisfaction. ...Ange-chan never felt any of it..." `
`"Ange was the one who couldn't accept it. `
`It isn't your fault." `
`"But who could possibly ask that of Ange-chan when she was just six years old...?! `
`I should've held out much, much longer, until she could understand my feelings...!" `
`"Eva nee-san, `
`I want you to believe one thing." `
`"............" `
`"We...don't blame you in the slightest." `
`"...Kyrie-san......" `
`"Thank you so much...for suffering so long for Ange's sake... `
`...If that kid has a human heart, then I'm sure she'll recognize the affection you showed her someday." `
`"Thank you, Aneki. `
`We'll always be grateful..." `
`"......Isn't that wonderful, Eva...? `
`...Your efforts...haven't gone unnoticed..." `
`"Uuuuu...uwaaaaaaaahhhh......" `
`"How are you doing, Ange-sama? `
`If you wish, I, Gohda, would be pleased to challenge you." `
`"Hohohoho. `
`And I, Kumasawa, have a veeery tricky puzzle for you." `
`"It doesn't matter how hard it is. `
`I'm not alone. `
`I'll solve it with Aunt Eva!" `
`Gohda and Kumasawa offered to challenge me. `
`I'll have to go up against everyone in the end, so it doesn't matter who comes next. `
`I waved at Aunt Eva to hurry up, `
`and she ran toward me. `
`"So, we're challenging this pair next? `
`Who will we start with?" `
`"Okay, ...Gohda-san." `
`"Very well, as you wish. `
`Here is my puzzle." `
`"Hohohohoho. `
`I'll warn you, it's a toughie." `
`"I'll still solve it. `
`I've gotten the knack of it." `
`"You'd better not underestimate Ange-chan. `
`Right?!" `
`"Right!" `
`"My, my. `
`...Well then, being the humble chef that I am, here is a puzzle about food and the kitchen." `
`"We'll fight together this time. `
`If you don't get it, just ask me to lend a hand. `
`I'll give you a hint." `
`"...If I get a hint, does that mean I won't get a medal?" `
`"It won't affect your medals at all, so feel free to ask away!" `
`"I've got it. `
`The hint here...is that the witch got home much later than usual." `
`"...What happens when she gets home later than usual?" `
`"Think carefully. `
`The food is always freshly-made and served at the usual time, right? `
`So, ...what happens when she gets home long after that?" `
`"...I don't get it. `
`Food can't talk." `
`"Well, uh, that's because this is a fairy tale puzzle..." `
`"Hohhohohohohoho... `
`It looks as though she didn't figure it out." `
`The answer I'd chosen at random was wrong, apparently. `
`...Too bad. `
`"Then tell me the right answer, Aunt Eva. `
`You figured it out, right? `
`Tell me!" `
`"All right. `
`The answer is-" `
`"Eva-sama, if you wouldn't mind...! `
`They say recipes and riddle answers are best while they remain secret." `
`"You think so...? `
`Heheheh, I'll have to tell her sometime later when you aren't around, then." `
`"Yeah, it's a promise!" `
`But even if I hear the answer later on, I still got it wrong. `
`Oh well. `
`I'd better pull myself together and take a shot at Kumasawa-san's puzzle. `
`"The ice cream! `
`The witch got back really late, so the ice cream would've melted. `
`So she couldn't eat it!" `
`"Nicely done! `
`See? `
`Ange-chan is a clever girl, isn't she?" `
`"Congratulations, Ange-sama! `
`Very impressive. `
`How quickly you saw through the puzzle that I, Gohda, put all my efforts into...!" `
`"It was totally easy. `
`Aunt Eva's puzzle was harder." `
`"*giggle* Thanks." `
`"Congratulations. `
`This medal is your prize for answering my question correctly." `
`"Thank you!" `
`Okay, that was easy. `
`Now let's take a shot at Kumasawa-san's puzzle. `
`"Looks like I'm up next. `
`Now, let's test Ange-sama with my specially-made, super-hard puzzle. `
`Are you ready?" `
`"How... `
`hard is it?" `
`"Hohohohohohoho. `
`You'll have to wait and see. `
`And now, let the mackerel dessert puzzle begin." `
`"Mackerel dessert...?" `
`"This is Kumasawa-san we're talking about, so you can bet it'll be a strange one. `
`Be careful." `
`"Okay!" `
`"Aunt Eva, do you get it?" `
`"She says you have to change one letter, so the answer's probably some sort of word game. `
`Her choice of words is suspicious to say the least. Try and think of some kind of dessert that you can make by changing a letter in... `
`Ah, I've got it!" `
`"Huh?! `
`What is it? What is it?!" `
`"Forget changing a whole letter... You only need to change one line. `
`In fact, that pretty much gives you the answer." `
`"*bzzzz*. `
`Wrooong." `
`"Huh?! `
`I don't get it! `
`I don't get it at all...!" `
`"Hohohohoho, sorry, but wrong is wrong. `
`Perhaps it was a bit too hard for you, Ange-sama." `
`"Come on, Kumasawa-san. `
`That was a nasty puzzle..." `
`"It doesn't make sense! `
`There's no way you could make a dessert out of mackerel! `
`What's the answer? `
`Tell me!" `
`"Hohohoho, it's no fun if I tell you. `
`If you don't guess it quick, ...then you really will be having mackerel for dessert. `
`Ihihihihihihihihihi..." `
`"Tell me, tell me!" `
`"I'm afraid I must say "no"." `
`Kumasawa smiled cheerily, but remained stubborn. `
`No matter how much I bother her, she probably won't tell me the answer. `
`"That concludes our puzzles. `
`There are probably others waiting for you to challenge them, Ange-sama. `
`Please, on to the next challenge." `
`"We're both rooting for you, Ange-sama." `
`"Okay! `
`I'll keep on trying hard and getting more and more medals!" `
`"That's the spirit. Don't let it get you down. `
`Plenty more chances left!" `
`We rushed away. `
`Okay, who should we take on next...?! `
`"I got it! `
`The letter is "b"! `
`If you change the "b" in Sabara to an "h", you get Sahara!" `
`"Hohohohohoho, `
`that's correct." `
`"The last line said you could make a grand "desert" out of sabara. `
`Not dessert...!" `
`"I figured out a trick in Japanese and English! `
`Am I awesome? Am I awesome?!" `
`"You're so smart, Ange-chan! `
`You deserve a pat on the head...!" `
`"Haha, `
`I like it when you do that." `
`"Just change a single letter, and even mackerel can make a fine desert. `
`Are you starting to see mackerel's true power?" `
`"The day I'm forced to serve a joke like that for dessert, I imagine heads will roll..." `
`"I wouldn't like it either. `
`I like ice cream for dessert." `
`"Ahahahahahaha, of course. `
`By the way, we shouldn't be worried, should we? `
`What about tonight's dessert?" `
`"Ohohohohoho... `
`I can hardly wait to surprise everyone with the mackerel fruit parfait waiting there in the kitchen!" `
`"Nooooooo!!" `
`Everyone burst out laughing. `
`For some time after that, I was tormented by the terrifying image of a parfait neatly topped with mackerel chunks... `
`"What a shame... `
`I tried so hard to stop Ange-sama from getting that prize, but she solved my best riddle like it was nothing." `
`Though she said that, Kumasawa smiled. `
`A gold-colored medal glittered in her wrinkly hand. `
`Ange took it. `
`"Well then, that's all for our puzzles." `
`"Please keep up the pace, get more and more medals, and win that splendid prize from the Master!" `
`"Okay! Thank you. `
`I'll keep it up...! `
`We did it, Aunt Eva!" `
`"Heheheh! `
`Let's keep it up!" `
`We rushed away. `
`Okay, who should we take on next...?! `
`"It seems that all of a sudden, the tiny girl who used to hide and tremble in Kyrie-sama's shadow... `
`has grown to be so bright and cheery..." `
`"...With each passing family conference, one can feel the growth of those youngsters. `
`After just a few years more, Ange-sama will surely learn of love, of makeup, `
`and will eventually grow to become a true lady." `
`"Very true... `
`If she grows normally with the passing time, that is..." `
`A cruel fate... `
`will force the chick called Ange into a lonely future. `
`If an egg isn't warmed, it won't hatch. `
`The egg she is now will not be warmed by anyone, and it will not hatch... `
`"Inside that frozen egg, `
`will Ange-sama have no choice but to face an isolated future...?" `
`"...An eggshell can always be broken from the inside. `
`...A cold shell may be very, very hard, but that doesn't mean it cannot be broken." `
`"Does Ange-sama have the strength to do that?" `
`"Is she capable of achieving that or not...? `
`I hear that question is what this final game is all about." `
`"Perhaps we should have sent her a clearer message. `
`...If the egg cannot be warmed, could we not at least strike it from the outside to make it easier to crack?" `
`"If a chick without the power to break its own shell is forced outside of the egg, `
`it won't be able to withstand the cold winds. `
`Ange-sama will have to find that power and resilience herself." `
`"...But, `
`can we not somehow explain that power and resilience to her?" `
`"Words mean nothing if they are merely given. They must also be accepted. `
`...No matter what we try to give Ange-sama, it will be meaningless unless she accepts it." `
`"......You're right. `
`No matter what we try to tell her, it won't matter unless she listens." `
`"Hohohoho... `
`We can do nothing but watch over her. `
`You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink." `
`"We can do nothing... `
`but pray that Ange-sama chooses a better future for herself." `
`"If Ange-sama does not abandon herself to anger for the sole purpose of distracting herself from her resignation and sadness... `
`If she can just be honest about that one, single wish that she truly desires more than anything else... `
`Then you can be certain that she will make her greatest wish come true." `
`"It is ironic. `
`...Since the very beginning, she has been denying that greatest wish of hers herself." `
`"Laughter brings happiness. `
`Tears bring misfortune. `
`Those who believe will be saved. `
`...People have the power to create their own futures by the strength of their emotions." `
`"I wish we could just let her hear those words..." `
`"Battler-sama is very strict. `
`...He's hoping that Ange will realize it by her own power alone...and is not permitting even words of this nature to be told to her." `
`"...It seems we can do nothing but watch over her." `
`"And so, let us at least pray. `
`Pray that she grasps the world she desires most with her own hands." `
`"Oh, have you selected me?" `
`"Yeah. `
`I'll have to face everyone sooner or later. `
`Right, Aunt Eva?!" `
`"Right! `
`Come on, let's have a puzzle. `
`We'll solve it in a flash!" `
`"Hahahaha. `
`I see, I see. `
`Then it seems I must make it a good one." `
`"Genji, `
`you should give her one as well. `
`A tough one." `
`"As you wish. `
`...In that case, a tough one it shall be..." `
`Whoa. `
`I'd hoped that Genji-san would give me a simple puzzle, but now he's saying it'll be tough. `
`Scary. `
`But I'll beat both of them. `
`I can't let myself get scared. `
`"Then let us start with mine. `
`I am a doctor, `
`so how about an ambulance puzzle?" `
`"The ??? is a number? `
`But emergency is a word. `
`You can't add a number to a word, right?" `
`"That part sounds like some kind of word game. `
`After all, "kyu-kyu-" means emergency, and "kyu-" means nine. If you write two nines together, it looks like 99, doesn't it?" `
`"So, if you add something to 99, you get an ambulance?" `
`"Hmm. Why does some number added to 99 get you an ambulance? `
`......Ah, I've got it!" `
`"Huh, really?! `
`Hey, what is it?!" `
`"I'll give you a hint. `
`You've got a big advantage here that most people around the world don't have. `
`*giggle* Then again, even people from other countries could narrow it down to two answers with a little math." `
`"Huh? ...Nnnnn... `
`...I don't get it..." `
`"Oh, are you having trouble? `
`I thought it was an easy puzzle." `
`It's a bit annoying to hear that about a puzzle I don't get. `
`Still, no matter how annoyed I get, I don't have a clue what the answer is. `
`"Aw, so close. `
`I thought you'd made it pretty far too..." `
`Apparently, Aunt Eva knows the answer. `
`She looks disappointed that I didn't figure it out too. `
`"...Mumumumu...? `
`Ah, yes, I have it! `
`If you subtract two from an ambulance, then add on 60, you can even learn the weather." `
`"Well done, Kinzo-san. `
`It seems I must hand this medal over to you." `
`"Wahahahahahaha. `
`Sorry, Ange. `
`This medal's all mine." `
`"...F-Fine, I don't care." `
`The gold medal passed from Nanjo to Kinzo. `
`That medal was supposed to be mine... `
`It's no use regretting it now. `
`If you subtract two from and add 60 to an ambulance...? `
`How would that tell you the weather...?? `
`"Hmm, what was the number for the weather forecasting service, I wonder?" `
`"......???" `
`Yeah, I don't have a clue. `
`I'll just have to pick myself up and have a go at Genji's puzzle. `
`"20! `
`Emergency sounds like 99, and if you add 20 to that, you get 119. `
`That's the emergency number for ambulances!" `
`"And if you subtract 20 from 130, you get 110. `
`That's the emergency number for calling the police." `
`"Splendid! That is correct. `
`I knew you were a quick thinker, Ange-san." `
`"Oooooooh, well done, Angeeeeeeee! `
`What a wise granddaughter I have!" `
`"Congratulations. `
`This medal belongs to you." `
`At any rate, the gold medal glittering in Nanjo's hand is now mine. `
`Okay, now I'll defeat Genji too and get another one. `
`"Yes, that's the spirit. `
`Let's solve more and more!" `
`"Your turn, Genji-san." `
`"My friend here doesn't speak much, but his knowledge is quite extensive. `
`Even I cannot wait to see what sort of puzzle he whips up." `
`"Now then, Ange-sama, `
`prepare yourself. `
`The puzzle starts now." `
`...I've never heard anyone say "prepare yourself" like that when giving a quiz. `
`I started to get so tense that my stomach began to hurt... `
`"It'll be okay. `
`Hang in there!" `
`Aunt Eva gripped my hand firmly, and my stomachache got a little better. `
`"...Ange-sama, have you learned division?" `
`"Y-Yeah. `
`I learned it in cram school." `
`"Incredible, a six-year-old who knows division?" `
`"Then there should be no problems. `
`Here it comes." `
`This is bad... `
`I did learn division, but I'm not very good at it... `
`"Half of its remaining length burns away each hour, right...? `
`After the first hour, it's burned down by half of 5 centimeters. `
`During the next hour, it burns down half of that remaining length. `
`And during the third hour, it burns down half of that remaining length..." `
`"...I can't really do it without a calculator. `
`Do you know the answer, Aunt Eva?" `
`"Ah, ...I've got it. `
`*giggle* This is a pretty mean puzzle." `
`"Why is it mean?" `
`"This has nothing to do with division. `
`Read through the puzzle again carefully." `
`...Umm, `
`...what was it, again...? `
`"My sincere apologies, but that is incorrect." `
`"Huh?! `
`Why?! `
`I know I did the math right...!" `
`"You see, ...there's no need for math in this puzzle. `
`Yep, he tricked us good this time..." `
`"Wahhahahahahahaha. `
`Too bad, Ange. `
`Did you get it, Nanjo?" `
`"Yes, of course. `
`Division is unnecessary. `
`This was an easy puzzle, one that even Ange-san could have solved." `
`Not only Aunt Eva, but everyone else said that math wasn't needed. `
`And I worked so hard on that division... `
`"That is all for my puzzle. `
`I believe several others are waiting for you to challenge them, Ange-sama. `
`Perhaps you ought to search for the next challenge." `
`"Good luck, Ange-san. `
`I am rooting for you." `
`"That's right. `
`This is no time to get down! `
`Now's our chance to turn things around." `
`"Yeah! `
`I'll try even harder and get lots of medals!" `
`We dashed away. `
`There are still many people waiting to give me puzzles. `
`I have tons of chances to get medals. `
`Okay, who should I challenge next...?! `
`"...After one hour, the 5 centimeters becomes 2.5 centimeters, `
`...and in the next hour, that becomes 1.25 centimeters, `
`...and in the next hour, that becomes 0.625 centimeters..." `
`"............" `
`"Ange-chan. `
`You don't need to use math. `
`Make sure you remember the problem clearly... `
`How long...is the candle when it burns out...?" `
`"Ah! `
`That was a close one...! `
`The candle goes out when it's 1 centimeter long, so the rest doesn't matter!" `
`The flame on this candle dies when the candle is 1 centimeter in length. `
`In other words, it can never get shorter than 1 centimeter. `
`So the right answer is the fifth choice, "About 10mm"...! `
`"That's right...!" `
`"You are correct." `
`"Oooh, splendidly done, Ange! `
`How clever of you, not to be misled!" `
`"I didn't even need division. `
`I almost got tricked...!" `
`"You were pretty mean there, Genji-san. `
`You even asked her if she could do division. `
`That was a trap, right?" `
`"Correct. `
`My humble apologies." `
`"Hahhahahahaha. `
`After all, Genji-san is the sort who can trick you without changing his expression in the slightest." `
`"Congratulations, Ange-sama. `
`This medal is proof that you have correctly solved my puzzle." `
`"Thanks! `
`Heheheh, I got another medal, Aunt Eva...!" `
`"Heheh, nice going!" `
`"I'll get lots more. `
`I'll get a ton, and then Grandfather will give me a great prize!" `
`"Indeed. `
`Give it all you've got, my granddaughter...!" `
`"Good luck, Ange-san. `
`I am rooting for you." `
`"There must be others waiting for you. `
`Perhaps you ought to search for the next challenge." `
`"Okay! Thank you. `
`I'll try even harder now...!" `
`We dashed away. `
`There are still many people waiting to give me puzzles. `
`I have tons of chances to get medals. `
`Okay, who should I challenge next...?! `
`After Ange and Eva left, `
`...Battler, who had been watching their progress, came over. `
`"How is Ange doing?" `
`"Oh, Battler. `
`I am not certain, but she does seem to be enjoying herself." `
`"I heard your puzzle, Genji-san. `
`Even I was almost taken in back there." `
`"You honor me." `
`"Still, it's not quite what I would've expected. `
`Who would've thought that you'd give a trick question like that? `
`I figured you'd make a straightforward, simple puzzle." `
`"Hahahahahahaha. `
`You might expect such a thing from him, silent as he is, `
`...but he is much more of a schemer than he appears." `
`"Very true. `
`If you play a chess match against him, you'll see that right away." `
`"He even fools me, from time to time. `
`He'll trick me right to my face, with that stern, serious expression of his. `
`He has always been like that. `
`And yet, despite the numerous occasions on which he has fooled me in the past, I keep on getting tricked. `
`Wahhahhahahahahahaha." `
`"Come to think of it, `
`...what sort of relationship do you and Genji-san have?" `
`For just an instant, Kinzo glanced at Genji's face. `
`Apparently, he didn't plan on touching on this subject if Genji had any objections. `
`However, Genji spoke as though there was no point hiding it any longer. `
`"...I knew the Master once...in Taiwan." `
`"Wahaha, "knew me", he says...! `
`We were partners in crime, you might say! `
`The two of us were both prodigal sons of rich families. `
`A pair of ruffians who caused their parents nothing but trouble." `
`"Genji-san, a prodigal son...? `
`That's a surprise... `
`So, Genji-san also moved to Taiwan, where he met Grandfather?" `
`"......No. `
`I am a native of Taiwan." `
`"Genji-san was born in Taiwan. `
`...Well, since Taiwan was under Japanese rule before the war, he is still Japanese, of course." `
`"He was a man who hated losing. `
`When we first met, we fought all the time. `
`Once we hit it off, we became the best of friends." `
`"...There was a lot of disorder and conflict after the war. `
`The Master is the one who saved me during that chaotic period. `
`...If I spent the rest of my life trying to repay that debt, it would not be enough to pay it back in full." `
`"......Don't say that, my friend. `
`...If only I had been a little more persuasive, I might have been able to bring your family back with us as well... `
`Because I was so inadequate, I was unable to save anyone but you..." `
`I don't know much about the details of Taiwan's history, `
`but apparently, there was still a lot of chaos there even after the war ended and Japan pulled out. `
`Kinzo, predicting this chaos before it happened, `
`worked out a way for Genji and his family to escape. `
`However, Genji's family possessed great wealth in Taiwan. `
`They were unable to abandon it, and they decided to remain there. `
`This wealth had been built up thanks to their close relationship with the Japanese-run government of Taiwan. `
`The new regime after the war wasn't likely to welcome them with open arms. `
`Much mayhem and confusion followed. `
`And Genji was the only one who escaped harm. `
`...I don't know what happened to make this man, whom Kinzo just called a troublesome prodigal son, `
`change so drastically to become the person he is today. `
`It was a story of friendship between the two of them, `
`...and there could be hardly any point in an unrelated person sifting through history books to interpret it however they pleased. `
`They had been good friends since long ago, and they owed each other their lives. `
`Though the troubled times tossed them about, their friendship held firm for decades... `
`Genji's role is now that of the butler, `
`...but when they're alone in the study, they sometimes share a drink and think back on the days of their youth. `
`...And they're still that way today. `
`Leaving Kinzo and Genji to reminisce, Battler walked off on his own. `
`It would be rude to ask for any more detail, and he didn't need to know. `
`Kinzo and Genji had been friends since long, long ago. `
`That was something he already knew. `
`"What do you think? `
`Do you want to challenge Aunt Natsuhi and Uncle Krauss next?" `
`"Yeah. `
`Let's beat them!" `
`"Hahahaha. Very well, we'll play along." `
`"The two of us have prepared some formidable puzzles for you." `
`"Should I go first? `
`Or you?" `
`"I will start." `
`"Very well." `
`"Listen closely to what I'm about to say. `
`White black white black white ???? black white black white black white." `
`"Huh? `
`White black white black...huh??" `
`"I'll say it once more. `
`White black white black white ???? black white black white black white. `
`...What does the "????" stand for?" `
`This is...a really hard one. `
`White black white black white ???? black white black white black white. `
`It looks like the white and black are alternating, but the "????" is between a white and a black. `
`Is it...gray?? `
`Is it that easy...? `
`"Th-This is a surprisingly hard one, coming from you, Natsuhi nee-san..." `
`Aunt Eva was groaning. `
`Apparently, this one's really tough. `
`"I-Is it really so hard...?" `
`"...There's a chance that some people won't understand, if they haven't had the right experiences." `
`"Eva-san aside, I think Ange-chan would have seen it a lot at school and kindergarten..." `
`"Wh-What the heck? I don't have a clue!!" `
`Is it a problem that I could get easier than Aunt Eva...? `
`...It's hard. `
`"The hint for this one is probably what Natsuhi nee-san said, about something you might see in a school or kindergarten. `
`...Do you know what it is, Ange-chan?" `
`"No, I'm stuck." `
`"See, even Ange-chan says she's stuck! `
`Give her at least a little hint." `
`"I-I see. `
`Then, a hint... `
`They may be different colors, but you get a beautiful sound no matter which you push." `
`"A beautiful sound...? `
`Are these black and white things something that make sounds?" `
`"Black and white things that make a sound when you push them...?" `
`"......I don't get it." `
`"I give up too. `
`...It seems even you know some pretty hard puzzles, Natsuhi nee-san." `
`"Hahahaha. `
`It's the sort of puzzle that brings out one's upbringing. `
`Perhaps it was a bit too hard for you." `
`"Wh-What did you saaaaaaay...?!" `
`"...Aunt Natsuhi, `
`could you tell me the answer?" `
`"The answer is...a keyboard." `
`"A keyboard? `
`Like on a piano?" `
`"That's right. `
`The blacks and whites are the pattern of colors on a keyboard. `
`In which case, you must already know the right answer." `
`Aunt Natsuhi smiled at me, but I don't really remember what a keyboard looks like. `
`...Nnng, too bad. `
`I'd better have a go at Uncle Krauss's puzzle and redeem myself. `
`"Ready? `
`It's Nii-san's turn now. `
`We'll solve it in a flash and teach him a lesson, okay?" `
`"That black and white thing...is a keyboard! `
`Like a piano!" `
`"Ah, ...is that it?! `
`It's a keyboard?!" `
`Something that can be found in kindergartens and schools, which is covered with a line of white and black things. `
`It's an instrument. `
`Like a keyboard on a piano or a melodica. `
`"The first two black keys are between "do", "re", and "mi". `
`The set of three black keys are between "fa", "so", "la", and "ti"..." `
`"It started "white black white black white ???? black", so...the three white ones are "do", "re", and "mi"..." `
`"There is no black key between "mi" and "fa". `
`So, "fa" comes right after "mi"!" `
`"And since the question mark comes after "mi", the right answer is "fa". `
`...In other words-" `
`""The right answer is white!"" `
`"Correct. `
`I thought it might have been a bit too hard, but you did well." `
`"Splendidly done, you two. `
`Go ahead, Natsuhi." `
`"Congratulations, Ange-chan. `
`Here's my medal for you." `
`"All right! `
`Aunt Eva, I got another one!" `
`"Things are moving along nicely. `
`Next up is Nii-san's puzzle. `
`Let's solve it in a flash and teach him a lesson, okay?" `
`"How interesting. `
`Looks like it's time you were taught a lesson." `
`"Stop it, Aunt Eva! Don't make him mad! `
`You'll make the puzzle harder!" `
`"Heheheheheheh. `
`If there's anyone you have to blame, it's Eva! `
`Now, take this brain-twister! `
`Here's a puzzle about the tenants of a skyscraper I've invested in." `
`"I don't know anything about this skyscraper, `
`so there's no way I could know..." `
`I know what's on floors 1, 2, and 14, so the answer must be somewhere on one of the other floors. `
`There's no doubt about that. `
`"Heheheheh. `
`Do you give up?" `
`"I-I won't give up, kiii!! `
`So, you're saying that Murakoshi Publishing Co., Ltd. is on this floor X?!" `
`"Yes, floor X. `
`But not the Xth floor." `
`"It's the same either way, isn't it...?" `
`"...Ah. `
`............" `
`Aunt Eva suddenly stumbled on something. `
`Then, she started counting on her fingers, starting from the first floor... `
`"I've got it, Ange-chan...! `
`Try saying them aloud, starting from the first floor...! `
`There's only one that fits!" `
`"Huh? `
`Wh-What do you mean...?" `
`"...I don't get it." `
`"It's "floor X", not "the Xth floor". That's the trick." `
`"That's right. `
`Though, in a way, the answer is right there in the question." `
`"What do you mean...?" `
`"For example, let's take floor 7. `
`You'd call that "the seventh floor", right? `
`But you wouldn't call floor 3 "the threeth floor", would you?" `
`"Precisely. `
`From floor 1 to floor 4, there's only one floor that does not end in "th"." `
`"A...Ah......" `
`By this point, even I had figured out the answer. `
`If only I'd paid a bit more attention to the way Uncle Krauss said the question... `
`"Hahahahahahaha. `
`Too bad. `
`Looks like I'll be keeping this medal." `
`"The third floor!" `
`"Mgh..." `
`"Well done, you got it...! `
`Ignoring the first and the second, there's only one floor that does not end in "th", ...the 3rd floor." `
`"Yeah! `
`The third floor fits, but the other ones are the "somethingth" floors." `
`"...N-Nicely done... `
`Even I didn't figure that out until I had the answer given to me..." `
`Apparently, Uncle Krauss once had this puzzle shown to him, and he wasn't able to answer it right. `
`He looked a bit downcast to see a kid like me solve it. `
`...For some reason, he looked even more mortified to see that Eva had solved it. `
`How strange. `
`"Come on, now. `
`Let's see that medal." `
`"This medal is a mark of Ange-chan's intelligence. `
`I mustn't let you have it, Eva." `
`"Heh, sore loser...!" `
`"Thank you, Uncle Krauss. `
`Am I incredible?!" `
`"Very much so. `
`You're a more flexible thinker than your uncle. `
`I am proud to have you as a niece." `
`"That's all for our puzzles." `
`"I do hope you enjoyed them." `
`"I did! `
`Thank you, Aunt Natsuhi and Uncle Krauss!" `
`"I hope you can enjoy all the tricky questions, without worrying about your medal count too much." `
`"We all hope that this becomes a wonderful night, just for you." `
`"We really are enjoying ourselves." `
`"Yeah! `
`We're having a lot of fun!" `
`Krauss and Natsuhi smiled at them as they dashed away. `
`"Oh, it's you, Natsuhi. `
`How did your puzzles go?" `
`"We did the best we could, `
`...but I'm not sure how much they enjoyed them." `
`On the other side of the room, Ange and Eva were counting the medals they had gathered so far. `
`Ange and Eva. `
`...It was such an unexpected pairing, but they looked like they were having a great time. `
`"...A future parent and child, unrelated by blood. `
`Watching them like this, they look just like a normal parent and child." `
`"Yes, they do. `
`...Bonds between people are nurtured by the heart. `
`Ties of blood do not bond as strongly." `
`After saying this, `
`...Natsuhi bit back her own words and stared at the floor. `
`"What's wrong?" `
`"...I was just...surprised that I would dare to say such words..." `
`"...... `
`...You don't need to worry about me." `
`"Because I rejected you, ...you met a painful fate in so many worlds... `
`...All of that is my responsibility..." `
`"I understand how you felt. `
`...Unable to become pregnant, you were forced to feel shame for many years. `
`In that situation, any woman would be shocked if they were handed a baby whose parentage they didn't even know, ...and then told to adopt them." `
`"...That was no reason... `
`for me to push you off a cliff..." `
`"True. `
`You will have to carry that cross for the rest of your life." `
`"...Yes. `
`I am prepared to do so..." `
`"In that case, the suffering you must endure will come from the cross you bear. `
`Not from me." `
`"You don't...despise me...?" `
`"Don't make that dejected face. `
`...No, perhaps it's the other way around. `
`As long as you continue making that dejected face, I will feel no desire to punish you. `
`As long as you continue to carry that cross, `
`I will feel no desire to hate you." `
`"Do you mean...that you don't hate me...?" `
`"To tell the truth, I did hate you. `
`I hated your guts. `
`I hated you so much, I wanted to hang up a pillow with your picture on it and use it as a punching bag!" `
`"But, as I watched you, that feeling faded away. `
`...You regretted and lamented. `
`And I'm sure you'll never forget that feeling for as long as you live." `
`"How could I forget...? `
`...After all, I'm a murderer..." `
`"Your cross is a heavy one, doubtless. `
`I can feel compassion for you now. `
`I'm serious. `
`After all, Kinzo was the one at fault, right? `
`It's his fault for having an illegitimate child in the first place! `
`And the way he forced that child on you was even worse! `
`He should at least have been able to avoid hurting you by saying `
`"Please take care of this poor child", instead of "You can't give birth, so adopt this kid". `
`Men! That Kinzo...!" `
`"............" `
`"I no longer hate you. `
`Doesn't that make the cross you bear feel any lighter?" `
`"No. `
`...I still don't know how I can make up for what I did to you." `
`"Then let's do it this way. `
`Hold out your arms." `
`"...H-Huh? `
`L-Like this...?" `
`As Natsuhi spread her arms uncertainly, `
`Beato leapt forward and hugged her tight. `
`"...U-Umm, `
`...th-this is a little..." `
`"I'll never say this again, so let me say it once. `
`...After all, I never had a chance to meet my mother." `
`Still hugging Natsuhi, Beato spoke in a whisper. `
`She spoke those words that she would certainly never say again... `
`"Thank you for worrying so much for my sake. `
`...But I really don't hate you anymore. `
`Please, believe that, `
`......Mother." `
`"...{f:5:B}-{f:5:Beatrice}......" `
