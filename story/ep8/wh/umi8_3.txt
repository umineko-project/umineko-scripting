`The VIP room was filled with the sweet smell of pumpkin tea... `
`and packed with smiles and laughter. `
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`Simply splendid. `
`I am glad to see you in such high spirits...!" `
`"I could say the same for you. `
`What idiot said you're reaching your last years?" `
`"I just borrow a bit of cheer from you. `
`Once I return to my study, I will be little more than a withering, senile old man." `
`"Enough with your lies! `
`Give it up and swear that you'll be living it large until you're a hundred." `
`"Same here. I haven't seen you for six years, but I was surprised to see how little you'd changed." `
`"Wahahahaha, you little brat. `
`So, it seems you've learned flattery during these past six years! `
`Sorry to disappoint you, but you're hardly a fair judge in the matter. `
`I have grown quite old indeed." `
`"I'll bet a thousand yen that Kinzo's still doing great when he turns a hundred." `
`"Yeah, me too. `
`Grandfather won't be any different when he's a hundred." `
`"Wahhahahaha! `
`Don't think you'll get any more presents for complimenting me!" `
`Kinzo laughed cheerily. `
`Beato, who sat next to Battler, was also laughing merrily. `
`Ange stood all alone by the window, `
`...staring at the others and trying to figure out what sort of relationship the witch of the portrait and her grandfather had. `
`There was a knock on the door. `
`"Is that you, Genji? `
`Come in!" `
`"...Pardon the intrusion. `
`Krauss-sama and Natsuhi-sama are here." `
`"Father...oh, and Battler-kun's here too." `
`"It has been some time, {f:5:Beatrice}-san. `
`Has there been any news?" `
`"I'm just the way I used to be. `
`Come on, have a seat. `
`And Ange, why are you standing by the window like that? `
`Come over here and sit down." `
`"Ange, come over here." `
`"...I'll just watch from here." `
`Ange grasped the candy she had gotten from Beato tightly, `
`and with a gaze that was still wary, she continued to stare. `
`Genji offered her a chair, but Ange just shook her head. `
`"Let her do as she pleases. `
`Come, Krauss, Natsuhi, and have a seat as well." `
`"...Is it something important? `
`I guess Ange and I should leave." `
`"Hey, if you leave, who's going to back me up here...?! `
`Kinzo, you don't mind if Battler stays, do you?" `
`"I have nothing to hide. `
`I care not." `
`However, he had called Krauss and Natsuhi to the VIP room to meet {f:5:Beatrice}, the Golden Witch. `
`It was hard to imagine that Kinzo wanted to have a casual conversation... `
`After Kinzo said he didn't mind, Beato also asked Battler to stay, so he decided to do so. `
`In order to avoid getting in the way of their conversation, Battler stood up from the sofa and walked over to Ange's window. `
`When the big brother finally came back to Ange, she clung to his waist, as though determined not to let him go away again. `
`"Oh, I see. `
`That must be why Ange doesn't like me." `
`"Huh? What do you mean? `
`Ange doesn't dislike you, does she?" `
`"*cackle*cackle* `
`You really don't understand women, Battler." `
`Beato smiled at Ange, but the latter turned to look the other way... `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`Even a young woman is a woman nonetheless." `
`When Beato stopped laughing, the conversation switched gears. `
`Why on earth did Kinzo summon Krauss and Natsuhi to the VIP room, and what was he going to talk about? `
`Everyone fell automatically silent. `
`"Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}, `
`each and every day, I remember the debt the Ushiromiya family owes from when it was saved from the brink of destruction." `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`Yeah, you'd better thank me." `
`"Well, it's actually your grandmother he's thanking." `
`"Shut up, you." `
`"No, it comes to the same thing. `
`All of that gold has been lent to the Ushiromiya family for three generations. `
`And without cost." `
`"...We truly...cannot be grateful enough." `
`"Gold bars are the same as bricks to me. `
`I had nowhere else to put them, so it was a relief to have Kinzo hold onto them." `
`"Whoa. `
`I'd like to say that just once before I die." `
`"......Is the Golden Witch...a rich person...?" `
`"Hmm? `
`Well, yeah. `
`After all, she just went and lent Grandfather 10 tons of gold." `
`"Precisely. `
`I've been borrowing it for several decades, always promising to return it someday. `
`It is a debt I will never be able to fully repay." `
`"The Head Family has never forgotten its gratitude. `
`Isn't that right, dear?" `
`"Of course. `
`If the {f:5:Beatrice}s hadn't kindly lent it to us for three generations, `
`the Ushiromiya family would have fallen long ago. `
`Even someone as shrewd as Father couldn't have done anything without funds to start with." `
`"By now, my money is making money, and the gold that made up my original funds can sleep in peace. `
`......Krauss, `
`do you know what I am about to say?" `
`Since the moment Krauss had been summoned here, he had guessed what Kinzo was hinting at now. `
`All things borrowed must be returned someday. `
`That day had finally come. `
`"...Yes, I understand, `
`Father." `
`"{f:5:Beatrice}, `
`I do not have many years ahead of me. `
`In fact, `
`...this may be the last family conference that we will attend together." `
`"How faint-hearted you sound. `
`You must be joking." `
`Beato alone laughed. `
`She looked at Battler, so he laughed along with her, but Kinzo and the others remained silent. `
`Apparently, there existed some major concerns about Kinzo's health... `
`"Of course, I do not intend to die as soon as next year. `
`However, I don't believe I can make any certain promises about meeting you again. `
`I never make promises I cannot keep." `
`"If you say it so proudly like that, I'm in no position to disagree. `
`...Are you serious about this?" `
`"{f:5:Beatrice}, `
`I want to make amends. `
`And I must do it while I am still in high spirits. `
`For that reason, I made a decision today." `
`"...What's Grandfather talking about...?" `
`"Quiet. `
`...Grandfather is...about to talk about something very important." `
`By now, even Battler understood what Kinzo was about to propose. `
`Beato probably realized it too... `
`At one time, the Ushiromiya family had ruled the skies like an eagle, ...before being crushed by the Great Kanto Earthquake. `
`The eagle had one of its wings torn off, and it crawled in the mud, on the point of death. `
`Then, they were saved by the Golden Witch's golden miracle. `
`Under the Golden Witch's protection, the eagle had nursed its wounds for many years. `
`And now, finally, it was time for the eagle to leave the nest the witch had provided... `
`"I will return all of the gold `
`that your grandmother lent me. `
`...Krauss, you have no objections, correct? `
`That gold did not belong to the Ushiromiya family in the first place." `
`"Of course. `
`I have no objections whatsoever." `
`"Are you sure, Krauss? `
`You're an investor, aren't you? `
`You could always do with more money, right? `
`Didn't you want Kinzo to hand the gold over to you?" `
`"Hahahaha... `
`Yes, now that you mention it, it's hard to deny what you say. `
`However, the contract was always between you and Father, and the gold was yours to begin with." `
`"My husband is the Successor, after all. `
`Just as Father rebuilt the family in one generation, `
`I am sure my husband will make the family thrive in his. `
`And this is something the two of us will do together." `
`"Hmm, well said. `
`Yes, that's the spirit." `
`"...So, letting go of 10 tons of gold leaves you with no regrets? `
`I must say, that is quite impressive. `
`What can a witch do against an opponent who cannot be swayed by the golden magic?" `
`"I will return the gold to you, `
`but the Ushiromiya family will always be supremely indebted to {f:5:Beatrice}, the Golden Witch." `
`"............" `
`They would return the gold once lent by the Golden Witch. `
`It was both simple and clear. `
`However, the expression worn by the Golden Witch herself was slightly lonely. `
`Ange couldn't understand why this was. `
`"...After all, if you're returning it, I cannot simply say "I don't want it, take it back". `
`Ah, well." `
`Beato rose from the sofa. `
`Then, she walked up to the window and looked down at the rose garden waving in the wind. `
`"Krauss, `
`I have also decided to present you and the others with my inheritance while I still live." `
`"F-Father..." `
`"When I die, you will not only be busy with the funeral, but I imagine that you will have Eva and the others at your throats over the inheritance issue. `
`If all is divided now, the funeral will be less trying for you. `
`...Krauss, write this down. `
`And Genji, please be our secretary. `
`I will now lay out the distribution of my assets." `
`Kinzo immediately began explaining how the inheritance would be split up. `
`Battler, realizing that he shouldn't be listening in on this conversation, `
`walked over to where Beato was loitering by the window... `
`"Hey, rich person. `
`If you've got too much gold on your hands, I'd be happy to lighten the load." `
`"Gold...would be more useful if you turned it into firewood and used it to cook a stew." `
`"What's the matter? `
`You're looking a bit bored." `
`"So, this day has finally come. `
`...I do feel a bit lonely." `
`"...You do?" `
`"My magic revived the Ushiromiya family and created Rokkenjima. `
`...And now, it seems the Ushiromiya family no longer has any need for the power of my gold. `
`It has taken flight, leaving the nest of my magic behind." `
`"True. `
`...That's how it's turned out." `
`"I have called Rokkenjima the witch's island, `
`...my island." `
`"...Yeah." `
`"And now, Rokkenjima is returning the gold to me. `
`...The day has come...for Rokkenjima to awaken from my magic." `
`"...... `
`...That's true." `
`"I...knew that this would be the last game. `
`...However, now that we've reached this point, even in a manner such as this, ...it's surprisingly painful." `
`"You're the type of person who looks totally carefree, but who's actually full of lingering attachments and regrets." `
`"The cruel and obstinate ones are usually the quickest to grow attached...and then to feel lonely." `
`"That's right. `
`That's the kind of person you are." `
`"...It was...a game for you and me." `
`"It was fun. `
`A great game you polished to perfection during those six years..." `
`"I once likened it to eternal torture for the both of us." `
`"...Eternity...is happiest when you can still believe that it's eternal. `
`But all things must end. `
`And we have to be aware of that." `
`"So, we must not avert our eyes." `
`"Just as the sun always rises, `
`there's no sun that doesn't set." `
`"............" `
`Of course, Ange didn't have the slightest idea what her brother and the witch were talking about. `
`...However, even as young as she was, she could feel that the pair had spent an incredibly long time together... `
`and that they understood each other so well that they might as well be a married couple... `
`Then, `
`Beato noticed her reaction. `
`"......Ange, `
`at one point, the two of us wove games for each other. `
`However, that time is now over. `
`This game has been made, not for our sake, but for yours." `
`They were speaking in riddles again. `
`Grasping the key that hung by her chest, Ange looked at her brother's face... `
`"We need to show you the contents of the cat box of this day. `
`...That key I gave you is for opening it." `
`"...What do you mean...by cat box...?" `
`"He means this day." `
`"With the miracle of magic, `
`I've brought you to the day you wanted to reach so much. `
`......You must continue telling the story of this day, as the final witch." `
`"Does that mean...that I mustn't remain here...?" `
`Ange's tone was slightly tense. `
`She understood what her brother meant, and it made her frown. `
`"Just how long have I suffered, wishing that I could return to the Rokkenjima of 1986... `
`And now, I've finally made it here! `
`So why are you chasing me out...?! `
`You said I could decide for myself!" `
`"That's right. `
`I did say that." `
`"I'm not leaving. `
`And please, stop trying to spoil me with this strange, made-up game...! `
`I want to know the truth of this day!!" `
`"She's a moody girl, be it 12 years in the future or in the past." `
`"Shut up. I didn't ask you...! `
`And what the hell do you think you're doing here...?! `
`Didn't the Golden Witch come here to perform her resurrection ceremony?! `
`Didn't you appear on the island with a crash of thunder and try to offer up 13 people as sacrifices?! `
`Why are you acting so happy and casual?! `
`It doesn't make sense!" `
`"You're the one that doesn't make sense. `
`What are you thinking? `
`Do you want me to be a murderer?" `
`"You wrote it down in a tale, sealed it in a message bottle, and threw it into the sea! `
`Two of those were discovered later on...! `
`Both of them were stories of cruel serial murders!" `
`"What a shame that only two of them made it to shore...! `
`How sad that "Land", my greatest masterpiece, was never seen by human eyes." `
`"I've been wanting to ask this for a while, but what's up with those message bottles?" `
`"As I was working out the details for my game against you, I began creating those tales along the way. `
`Once I realized that I could create endless different tales out of the same game board, it really started to get fun...!" `
`"So, you wrote them down, hoping that I'd read them someday." `
`"Precisely! `
`They were so good, I just couldn't bear to wait for your return...! `
`Inspired by Agatha Christie, I tried sealing them in bottles and throwing them into the ocean. `
`Mysterious, don't you think?!" `
`"Don't mock me...!!! `
`Those were your plans for the crime! `
`You used the location of the hidden gold to fan up discontent between the family members... `
`as you planned your brutal serial murders...!!" `
`"Sheesh, `
`is that what I've become in the year 1998? `
`...Well, I guess I can't blame them, *cackle*cackle*." `
`"Huh?! `
`What's with the sudden change of character...?!! `
`Is this some scheme to make me let my guard down?! `
`I'm not gonna be fooled so easily, {f:5:Beatrice}! Onii-chan!! `
`You want to make me surrender and say that witches exist, don't you?! `
`You think I'll fall for that...?! `
`I'll find the truth without your help!" `
`"Even though that truth is all around you right now? `
`You once called yourself Gretel, but it seems the name Mytyl would be more fitting." `
`"Enough!!!" `
`Ange tried to slap Beato's cheek. `
`However, the difference between their heights was so great that Beato dodged before the hand could reach her. `
`"Stupid... `
`Stupid...! `
`I won't accept it... `
`I'll never...acknowledge this farce as the truth...!!" `
`After Ange yelled those words, her eyes grew cloudy. `
`They cleared up almost immediately. `
`By that time, she had already gone back to her six-year-old self... `
`"......You're right, Ange. `
`This is the sin I left behind, ...and the reason for this final tale's existence." `
`".........?" `
`As Ange stared blankly, uncomprehending, Beato gently patted her head. `
`"Indeed. `
`This tale is a farce. `
`Of course it isn't the truth. `
`...However, `
`there is something that he feels he must tell you. `
`...Something he's so determined to convey that he went to such lengths." `
`"Beato, `
`I'm already showing her. `
`I don't want to force it on her." `
`"I see." `
`"...I don't understand what you're saying. `
`...I'm sleepy." `
`"True. `
`We should probably go take a nap." `
`"Kinzo, `
`must I remain here longer?" `
`"My apologies, but I must ask you to stay for just a bit. `
`...Moving on, Krauss, `
`the continued support of the Fukuin House should be viewed as your responsibility as the Ushiromiya Family Head..." `
`"...What a pain. `
`Forgive me, Battler. `
`It seems I cannot go with you. `
`...Genji, `
`would you mind taking these two to the guesthouse?" `
`"As you wish. `
`...Battler-sama, Ange-sama, please follow me." `
`"Thanks. `
`...See you later, `
`Beato." `
`"Of course! `
`I have a mountain of things I wish to discuss with you. `
`And I'd like to have some time alone tonight. `
`We must act the part of a married couple every now and then...!" `
`"Wh-What do you mean, act the part of a married couple? `
`Ihihi...!" `
`Because Ange had gotten so bored, she had grown very sleepy. `
`It would probably be best for her to take a quick nap. `
`Battler walked through the windy rose garden, pulling her by the hand. `
`When he questioned their guide, Genji, ...he learned that the old servant had known beforehand of Kinzo's desire to return the gold to Beato... `
`and settle the inheritance problem early. `
`"...The Master decided to start preparations early for his final task in this world, the ending of his life." `
`"Most people don't think much about what happens after they die... `
`...Haah. `
`Guess Grandfather just lives on a whole different scale." `
`"Today marks the start of a new flight, when the Ushiromiya family will depart from the Golden Witch's patronage." `
`"...That's true. `
`Heheh, that's a pretty cool way to say it." `
`Apparently, a grand Halloween party was to be held tonight, `
`and Gohda and the others had been ordered to start getting ready for it. `
`However, it wouldn't just be a party. `
`It would be a ceremony to mark the return of {f:5:Beatrice}'s gold. `
`At the start of dinner, Grandfather would make the announcement, `
`and the three generations of {f:5:Beatrice}s would be thanked for their gift to the family with a round of applause. `
`Apparently, this was what they had planned. `
`"Are we still keeping this secret from Dad and the others?" `
`"Technically, it is a secret. `
`...However, the Master did not suddenly begin thinking in this way today. `
`He has considered this day many times over many years, and has even discussed certain matters with his children. `
`I doubt that any will be surprised to hear this night's announcement." `
`"Apparently, my old bastard's been running all over the place trying to get money for his company. `
`I guess he'll be dancing around when he hears that Grandfather's giving him his part of the inheritance early. `
`A nice present for him." `
`"I rather think the great responsibility is what will spur him on. `
`...Ever since Rudolf-sama left the island, he has succeeded splendidly. `
`However, his success so far has been supported by the Master's wealth." `
`"...And now that he's suddenly getting his inheritance money, he'll have to keep going by his own strength alone in the future. `
`...Heheh, that's some nice pressure for him." `
`"The siblings must have suffered for decades because of their father's excess of success and ability. `
`...Simply having a parent who is too successful can be a great burden to a child." `
`"And tonight, `
`...they'll be leaving the nest, truly becoming adults for the first time." `
`"It seems the Master plans to call this night a gold-returning ceremony. `
`...However, he originally intended to call it a living funeral." `
`"Sounds pretty depressing, having a funeral while you're still alive. `
`I'll admit that calling it a day to start a new journey and leave the nest fits the Ushiromiya family much better." `
`"......Onii-chan, ...I'm sleepy..." `
`"Look, we're almost to the guesthouse. `
`Do you want to go to Mom's room? `
`Or to the cousin room?" `
`"I don't care... `
`...I'll...sleep until dinner..." `
`Ange, still holding her brother's hand, crouched down and looked as though she was about to fall asleep. `
`Battler lifted her up and carried her. `
`As she felt the warmth and safety of her brother's back, Ange drifted off into sleep... `
`What happened that day...? `
`Just what on earth happened on October 4th and 5th, 1986? `
`Because of the massive size of the Rokkenjima Explosion Accident, the time of the explosion was known almost exactly, down to the minute. `
`That time was... `
`October 5, 24:00. `
`The sheer improbability of that round number proved that the accident had been produced by artificial means. `
`Later on, the following statements were collected from individuals who knew Ushiromiya Kinzo when he was alive. `
`During his lifetime, Ushiromiya Kinzo built a clock rigged to blow up the island at exactly 24:00. `
`This clock was apparently inside his secret study. `
`When he felt mentally cornered and wanted to think up a brilliant plan, `
`he would activate that device and use the tension of the approaching midnight to bring some flash of inspiration to him. `
`While Ushiromiya Kinzo still lived, this was only thought of as a tall tale about this eccentric man, `
`...but the fact that the Rokkenjima Explosion Accident occurred at exactly 24:00 supported the story... `
`"...It sounds crazy." `
`"He must have hoped to gain some sort of mystical power from those short periods of madness. `
`If we call this his source of high-output mental power, the story isn't that difficult to swallow." `
`Professor Ootsuki spoke passionately. `
`Witch Hunters. `
`Enthusiasts who treat the mad fantasy surrounding Rokkenjima as their plaything. `
`Ange had no reason to love these people, who embellished the deaths of her family just for the fun of it. `
`How ironic it was to Ange, who wanted to know what happened that day, `
`that such people knew more about that island than anyone else. `
`"If someone used that device, the island would be blown away without a trace. `
`......There would be nothing left. `
`No matter what had happened there, they could erase it." `
`"Theories that Ushiromiya Eva was the ringleader of some conspiracy sprang up very early on. `
`However, no one was able to explain how she set off such a massive explosion." `
`"And the rigged clock proves that such a thing was possible..." `
`"Correct. `
`We can theorize that Ushiromiya Eva, fully aware of the timing and expected radius of the explosion, took refuge in Kuwadorian." `
`"...To get all of the family wealth to herself, `
`she killed everyone...and used the explosion to remove all evidence..." `
`"That idea provides the most logical explanation for the Rokkenjima mystery. `
`It also conforms with the fact that Eva never spoke to anyone about the events of that day." `
`Where was that rigged clock, and how did Eva find it? `
`Several forgeries have speculated on this matter. `
`There's no need for me to waste time thinking about it. `
`Eva activated the clock device, hid in Kuwadorian to escape the blast, `
`and was therefore the only one to survive. `
`That was everything, the answer, which eloquently told the whole story. `
`...When Eva first adopted me, `
`our relationship wasn't that bad at all. `
`I asked her several times. `
`What happened that day? `
`Every single time she answered, it was to say that she didn't remember. `
`But, ...well, she must have been flustered at the time. `
`The very first time I asked, she answered like this: `
`"I can't...tell you about it." `
`It was a slip of the tongue. `
`She knew what had happened that day. `
`And she left this world without telling even a bit of the truth. `
`She sealed the truth in a cat box... `
`and left this world, taking the key with her. `
`There can be only one answer. `
`She was behind everything. `
`She got to keep all of the family wealth to herself and became super-rich. `
`And afterward, she lamented the fact that her beloved son would never inherit any of what she had created, ...and she cursed me. `
`...Just remembering that old bitch makes me want to vomit. `
`What happened that day? `
`That's what I want to know. `
`It's my only goal, ...the one reason I'm still alive. `
`However, later on, I had to come to grips with the fact that my goal was an abstract one. `
`After all, though I don't know what happened that day... `
`If it's a question of "who" did the crime... `
`That's already clear. `
`Ushiromiya Eva. `
`She's the culprit. `
`That has never changed since the beginning. `
`That's right. `
`I'm not trying to find out what happened that day. `
`I'm trying to find out what Ushiromiya Eva did that day. `
`If I can reveal that, then I can expose Eva's evil, even though she's already dead. `
`That is...my true goal. `
`The police also suspected that the accident might be a crime, and they did investigate. `
`However, no matter how much they inspected the crater that had once been Rokkenjima, they didn't find anything at all. `
`The public and the Witch Hunters cornered Eva with several bits of circumstantial evidence, but not a single bit of physical evidence was found... `
`Though Eva was only the merest fraction of a shade away from guilty, they were unable to expose her crime... `
`My goal isn't anything as vague as learning what happened that day... `
`It's to expose the crime Ushiromiya Eva committed that day...and to have my revenge. `
`I haven't been able to expose Ushiromiya Eva's crime, so people are acting as though the events on the island were all done by some bizarre Golden Witch. `
`Defeating the Golden Witch means exposing Ushiromiya Eva's sin. `
`I won't forgive Ushiromiya Eva. `
`I'll certainly...certainly...... `
`Hate her and take revenge for my family. `
`That is Ushiromiya Ange's one and only reason for living... `
`"Hahhahahaha. `
`If she knew you hated her that much, the President would probably be rolling around laughing in the next world." `
`"...Shut up. `
`I'll expose that old bitch's crime. `
`...I won't accept that it was a perfect crime, with all traces blown away. I'll never do that." `
`"In other words, this journey of yours is a journey to take revenge for your family." `
`"Got a problem with that?" `
`"You must be joking. `
`It's great to know that you have a purpose in life." `
`"...Could you turn that off?" `
`"Oh? `
`You don't like M. Zakki?" `
`Amakusa turned the radio off. `
`The dull sound of the engine became the BGM that filled the car. `
`"Is it really so strange? `
`Fighting for revenge." `
`"Not really. `
`Out on the front, I met people who live for that reason over and over." `
`"...You've been on battlefields many times as a mercenary, right?" `
`"Well, I've seen a few." `
`"So, are people who fight to take revenge for their families... `
`strong?" `
`"No doubt about it. `
`...Some people'll even strap bombs to themselves and commit suicide to take revenge for their families. `
`Humans are more than capable of dying for vengeance." `
`"...That's right. `
`I could do it too." `
`"Have you heard of child soldiers?" `
`"You mean kids who fight like soldiers?" `
`"That's it. `
`Kids who've lost their parents and have nowhere to go sometimes get picked up by groups of armed insurgents and become soldiers. `
`...They get a gun thrust in their hands, and they're taught how to take revenge. `
`...But in the end, children are expendable. `
`Anyone can be a soldier in a battlefield if they can pull a trigger." `
`"Are you trying to say that I'm like that?" `
`"Revenge can be a reason for living. `
`It can also give you the strength to become a soldier. `
`...Like a miracle, it can turn a girl who could do nothing but sob over her parents' corpses into a soldier, almost overnight. `
`...Nothing gives you more power than revenge." `
`"I guess so. `
`And that's what I'm like." `
`"Do you know about the child soldier problem?" `
`"No." `
`"Child soldiers who are given guns and taught how to take revenge...make that their reason for living. `
`Well, that's not exactly right. `
`It becomes their reason for firing their guns. `
`......But revenge is something that never ends. `
`At some point, they no longer have any reason to keep shooting." `
`"...What do you mean?" `
`"They once shot for revenge. `
`But, eventually, they keep on shooting for no reason at all." `
`"You mean they forget about taking revenge?" `
`"When revenge is impossible, they eventually get tired of it and forget their original goals. `
`When that happens, they have nothing except their guns. `
`Eventually, they'll keep shooting just so they can eat." `
`"...You're saying that child soldiers who started using guns for revenge... `
`end up as bandits or something?" `
`"After all, they've never even gone to school, and they haven't been taught any useful skills as far as employment goes." `
`They only learned how to shoot guns. `
`And they were only ever praised when they killed the enemy. `
`"Eventually, your reason for living stops being revenge...and becomes the means you once used to take revenge. `
`...It's sad, really." `
`"Are you saying that I'll eventually get tired of revenge, and... `
`...uh, what would it be in my case?" `
`"You'll get tired of exposing the truth, `
`and you'll eventually become a person who can do nothing but hate Ushiromiya Eva." `
`"Well, that's true already. Got a problem with it?" `
`"Hyahha...! `
`Come to think of it, that's right." `
`I'm not sure what Amakusa is trying to say. `
`Probably something annoying. `
`So I'm not interested. `
`"...Revenge is pointless. `
`Is that what you're trying to say?" `
`"You still have a long life ahead of you, Lady. `
`With your youth, you could do anything. `
`...I get the feeling that this journey might be a waste of that precious youth." `
`"It's none of your business. `
`...I've already jumped once, remember? `
`Off that huge skyscraper." `
`"And you only barely made it out of that alive." `
`"Back then, `
`I died. `
`So, I'm already a ghost. `
`And my only purpose is to expose the truth of that day, to take revenge on my family's enemy." `
`"...Sheesh. `
`That's an iron will you've got there, Lady." `
`"There's no way a flippant man like you could understand how I feel." `
`After that, Amakusa was forced to shut his mouth. `
`He shrugged, but Ange didn't see. `
`Even so, Amakusa spoke once more. `
`"On the first day we started this journey, `
`...you said something. `
`You said you wanted to know what happened on that island that day." `
`"It's the same now. `
`What's changed?" `
`"Now, you're saying that you want to know what happened on that island that day `
`so you can expose Ushiromiya Eva's crime." `
`"And isn't that exactly the same?" `
`"...Well, that's true, but..." `
`"I'm tired, so I'll sleep now. `
`Would you mind staying quiet for a bit? `
`Tell me when we get there." `
`"Roger that." `
`I wasn't particularly tired, really. `
`I just said that because I didn't like talking about this. `
`"Don't become one. `
`A child soldier." `
`Ange, who had decided to feign sleep, ignored him. `
`But Amakusa kept talking. `
`He wanted to make sure she heard at least this much. `
`"You started on a journey to learn the truth. `
`It's becoming more and more a journey of revenge. `
`...A journey to have revenge by exposing the truth. `
`But, as you know, there's nothing left on Rokkenjima. `
`There aren't even any traces left. `
`...Exposing the truth might not be a picnic." `
`...I know what Amakusa's trying to say. `
`The police searched the scene so thoroughly just after the crime, and even they weren't able to find any physical evidence proving that Ushiromiya Eva was the culprit. `
`And a full 12 years have passed since then. `
`...If the truth could be discovered by a girl like me, waving wads of cash around to pick up a bit of info from those who were somehow related to the incident, `
`then someone would have exposed the truth long ago. `
`I might not be able to reach the truth. `
`If so, ......then my first desire, my desire to expose the truth, will probably fade away. `
`After that, only my hatred for Eva will remain. `
`Just like those child soldiers, who forget their original purpose and live just to shoot. `
`I'll forget my original purpose...and live just to hate. `
`I'll do nothing but despise Ushiromiya Eva, ...but my goal, exposing the truth for revenge, will be gone, `
`...so hating Ushiromiya Eva will become my whole life. `
`...Is there any difference between shooting for revenge and shooting to live? `
`When you pull the trigger, someone dies either way. `
`And what about my case? `
`Is there any difference between hating Eva as I expose the truth...and hating Eva after I've given up? `
`There's no difference. `
`In the end, whether I find the truth or not, I'll just keep on cursing Eva, over and over, until I die. `
`......What a crappy life. `
`But now, ...that's all I have left. `
`Ushiromiya Eva stole my family. `
`So, I'll take revenge. `
`...By exposing her crimes and showing the world. `
`...My consciousness was slowly drifting away into sleep... `
`Why is Onii-chan showing me such a bizarre Rokkenjima...? `
`Is this supposed to be the truth? `
`Enough with this farce. `
`Why is even Onii-chan trying to hide the truth from me? `
`I'm trying to find it so that I can avenge him and the others. `
`...Or would Onii-chan say the same thing as Amakusa? `
`That revenge is meaningless, so I should stop? `
`Is that why...he's speaking in riddles, trying to make everything more confusing...? `
`...That's none of his business. `
`I'm not just trying to take revenge for their sakes. `
`I'm doing it for my sake too. `
`After all, that's the only reason I'm still alive. `
`Taking revenge...is my reason to live. `
`......... `
`I don't have a clue... `
`what Onii-chan is thinking. `
