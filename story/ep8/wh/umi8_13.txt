`The Book of the Single Truth was sealed in crystal by Battler. `
`Until this seal is undone, I can't even stick the key in the keyhole. `
`"...You can remove this, `
`right?" `
`"Of course." `
`They were in a vast, dimly-lit space. `
`To sum it up in a phrase, ...it was like a trench in the ocean floor. `
`No, that's not quite right. `
`It was...a library. `
`However, the number of books and the height of the shelves vastly surpassed all of those that existed in the world of humans. `
`If height is the measure of greatness, `
`...then the gods must surely be giants taller than mountains. `
`This place appeared to be a library big enough and grand enough for such gods. `
`Each individual book was no larger than those from the human world. `
`However, the shelves holding them stood like the walls of a valley...or rather a deep-sea ocean trench. `
`So, ...Ange and the others looked like little more than a few small butterflies who had wandered into this vast library. `
`...Like miniscule deep-sea fish swimming about all alone in an ocean pit. `
`"This is more like ice than a seal. `
`...If you just steal it away from Battler and put it under the rays of the sun, it will fade away by itself as time passes." `
`"Isn't there some way to just smash it open?" `
`"...Do you thaw your frozen fish by smashing it with a hammer?" `
`"Sorry, I was always terrible in cooking class." `
`"...Kitties, `
`thaw this seal." `
`When {f:5:Bernkastel} whispered, from the dark ocean pit deep below them, `
`...several emerald green glints appeared and gathered like a school of fish. `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} threw the Book of the Single Truth down to them, and only after several seconds passed, the school of fish seemed to gather around it and carry it away. `
`Those few seconds made it clear just how deep this bookshelf trench went. `
`Ange was once again dumbfounded by this unimaginably vast and godly library... `
`"We can just let them handle the rest." `
`"...And you really will let me see what's inside?" `
`"If that is your wish, I'll grant it. `
`And, of course, I won't be able to read it myself without that key of yours." `
`Ange silently gripped the golden key in her pocket... `
`This journey has been so long...and so strange. `
`In search of the truth from 12 years ago, I left my home, ...met President Okonogi, met Amakusa... `
`...And, at some point, that adventure became wrapped in the Illusion of the Witch. `
`However, here I am. `
`Ushiromiya Eva's diary is here. `
`The truth inside it is sitting right before me. `
`"Rest for a while. `
`...Even I don't have enough free time to spend it all with you." `
`"...Well, I'm not really tired." `
`"Erika, `
`...serve Ange some tea or something." `
`"Yes, my master!" `
`Erika popped into existence out of nowhere and bowed to her master. `
`"......{f:5:Bernkastel}, `
`if you're planning to use me to steal both the key and the book, ...you won't get off easy." `
`"H-How dare you say such a thing to my master?!" `
`"Sorry. `
`After my long experience with witches, I've decided not to trust normal words." `
`"...Very well. `
`I'll promise it with the red truth. `
`{p:1:When the seal on the Book of the Single Truth is dissolved, you, Ange, will be the first to read it.} `
`...Is that good enough for you?" `
`For some time, Ange considered the witch's words, searching for some sort of trap hidden within them... `
`There's no guarantee greater than a witch's red truth. `
`Ange understood this well enough. `
`If she started to doubt even this red truth, ...there would be nothing left to trust in this entire world. `
`If she began to suspect even this, ...then even the truth would no longer be truth. `
`"...Is there something more you want?" `
`"Nn... `
`...No, I'm fine." `
`If she wanted to read the Book of the Single Truth, she would need {f:5:Bernkastel}'s assistance. `
`Ange finally realized that she had nothing to gain by complaining more and annoying this witch further... `
`"...Once you've dissolved the barrier, call me right away." `
`"Of course. `
`I also want to read it as soon as possible. `
`I'll call for you at once." `
`Bern spun away from them, then vanished into the dark bookshelf trench. `
`Ange saw a school of emerald green fish appear and follow behind {f:5:Bernkastel}. `
`...Could those be her familiars? `
`As she stared at the emerald lights that resembled some sort of deep-sea fish, Ange was poked from behind. `
`"Let's go, `
`comrade Ange." `
`"...You're creeping me out, so please just call me Ange." `
`"Then you can call me Erika-sama." `
`"...Let's get going, comrade Erika." `
`The pair began to swim in the direction Erika indicated. `
`"Swim" seemed a better word for it than "fly". `
`"...Just what is this place? `
`It's way too big to be called a library." `
`"It's not like you'll be able to remember its name, so why not just call it the Library?" `
`"I'll decide what I can or can't remember. Tell me." `
`"It's "the Great Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating's Noble City of Carefully Selected Books"." `
`"...Yeah, the Library works fine." `
`"Knew you'd say that." `
`The City of Books. `
`Yeah, the name fits. `
`The bookshelves on either side of this canyon are skyscrapers. `
`If I think of those emerald green lights flowing beneath us as headlights on a highway, then this really does seem like a city of books. `
`"These aren't normal books, are they?" `
`"That's right. `
`Each volume is packed with an ensemble play. `
`...They look like books from here, but if you open one up, you'll find a whole world inside." `
`"...So, even our long tale is only one of these." `
`"Great witches who live on a far, far higher plane than we do are hardly any different from a Creator, or God. `
`...From their perspective, our little tale is worth little more than a single book, if it's even worth that." `
`From a theatergoer's perspective, our individual lives are hardly worth anything at all. `
`If they're recording an entire world in a single volume, ...then my life probably isn't even worth a single line. `
`"But we're the main characters. `
`...I am, and so are you." `
`"That's right. `
`Even if the tale of the gods doesn't mention us, `
`...we're always the main characters in the stories we write for ourselves. `
`......Becoming aware of that fact is the first thing that separates witches from Humans." `
`They were on a balcony, which was really a room-sized section that had been dug out of the bookshelf, with no guardrail along the cliff. `
`It didn't go in very deep, so it looked like a room that had been cut in half. `
`It was filled with the tools of everyday life, as though this was Erika's hidden house. `
`"My master has ordered me to serve you some tea, `
`so if you don't feel like drinking, I'll have to pour it into you with a funnel." `
`"...If you try, I'll have to serve you some matcha." `
`"Matcha?" `
`"...Nothing. Just talking to myself." `
`Ignoring Erika as she made tea, ...Ange looked down upon the bizarre, otherworldly scene below. `
`Until Erika finished getting the tea ready, the scene held Ange's gaze like it was sucking out her soul... `
`"This might sound strange, coming from me." `
`"...What?" `
`"You actually made a deal to throw away your life to learn the truth, huh? `
`That's impressive." `
`"...I had nothing to gain from life. `
`It was easy for me to trade away the time I had left." `
`"My master really does take to idle whims. `
`To think she would make a contract for the meaningless life of a powerless girl." `
`"......Heh." `
`Ange chuckled, not bothering to argue. `
`That was exactly right. `
`How incredible that {f:5:Bernkastel} would lend her power to a worthless life that was trying to throw itself away. `
`"Well, my master is the witch who controls miracles. `
`...So, it makes sense that she'd appear even for a worthless girl like you." `
`"Good point. `
`...Even if {f:5:Bernkastel} hadn't appeared, I still would've taken that step off the edge that day." `
`"...You really are a cheap and easy woman, aren't you?" `
`"Well then, just how much are you worth?" `
`"Me?! `
`Hahaha, ahahahahahahahahahaha..." `
`The way Erika cackled was disturbing. `
`Still, Ange realized that this was her way of answering the question. `
`People don't become witches of their own choosing. `
`If they're capable of living, all people want to live their lives as Humans. `
`...When something comes along to trip up that life, ...that's when the road to living as a witch opens. `
`Even Furudo Erika, who calls herself the Witch of Truth, must be like this. `
`The two Witches of Truth, sitting here drinking tea without even looking at each other, ...are exactly the same. `
`"I...like exposing the truth." `
`"I know that." `
`"I like exposing secrets, then watching those people turn pale as they wonder how I figured it out. `
`...That's when I know I've reached the truth, and it's a moment of ecstasy." `
`"There's something seriously wrong with you." `
`"Well then, what does the truth mean to you?" `
`"............" `
`Ange was about to give an immediate answer, but she bit back her words. `
`Then, she gulped, not knowing how to respond. `
`After all, to Ange, the truth itself was the goal. `
`At first, it was out of hatred. `
`Could Ushiromiya Eva, the sole survivor of Rokkenjima, be the culprit behind everything? `
`She hated Eva, but she had no proof that her aunt was the culprit, and of course, Eva never talked about what happened on that island. `
`...So, at first, "the truth" meant proof that Eva was the culprit, in Ange's eyes. `
`However, that feeling withered away with Eva's death. `
`Now that Eva was dead, even if Ange did find some kind of proof, ...it wouldn't mean anything. `
`So, eventually, the truth Ange wanted to find...became nothing more than the simple desire to know what happened on that island that day. `
`However, one thing was obvious. `
`Even if she did find out the truth, ...that wouldn't bring any of her family back to her. `
`"...It might not mean anything at all." `
`"You're going to expose the truth your beloved Onii-chan is hiding, even though it's meaningless? `
`You're the one who's not making sense." `
`Erika laughed mockingly. `
`Ange laughed too, as though she agreed. `
`"And so, `
`my own truth became my goal. `
`...Maybe you could even call it my reason for living." `
`"So, once you do reach the truth, there won't be any point or purpose to you living anymore, right?" `
`"That's right. `
`So, I'll die. `
`...Hasn't it been long enough? `
`I've already lived 12 years too long. `
`Don't I at least deserve to have a witch appear and grant my wish in my final moments?" `
`"...Or, to put it simply, you're just tired of life. `
`Does that sum it up?" `
`"Yeah. `
`So, both my reason for living and my very existence...are completely meaningless. `
`...That's why this goal of finding the Book of the Single Truth has put a little sparkle back into my life, now that it's nearly over. `
`...At least on that score, I'm grateful to {f:5:Bernkastel}." `
`"I see. `
`...Battler wants you to live, so he hid the goal line that would lead you to death. `
`...I think I pity Battler-san for the first time. `
`After all, you can't choose your little sister." `
`"............" `
`Sorry, Onii-chan. `
`I'm...tired of life. `
`For 12 whole years... `
`I've been living off nothing but the illusion that someone might come home someday. `
`Just let me find peace already. `
`Finding the truth of that day...is how I've chosen to mark the end of my life. `
`For 12 years, I've believed in a miracle, but there was no miracle... `
`I won't...believe in miracles anymore... `
`"...The Book of the Single Truth, huh? `
`Of course, I'm also dying to find out what's in it, `
`but from what I hear, it doesn't sound like the truth inside is something spectacular enough to mark the end of your life with." `
`"Yeah. `
`...At first, I hoped there would be something earth-shattering in it. `
`But now, ...I've calmed down, I guess you could say." `
`"Any truth searched for by a worthless person is bound to be worthless. `
`It'll probably make for a fitting end to your worthless life." `
`"...Yeah. `
`I'm...sure it will." `
`Ange was already starting to realize something. `
`Regardless of Eva's reason for staying silent... `
`......The real events of that day...probably weren't anything earth-shattering. `
`Some sort of malfunction made the bomb in that secret underground base explode. `
`Yes. `
`...It was just...an accident. `
`But, ...the public already believed that some sort of conspiracy surrounded the events of that day, so that's what they expected. `
`Eva was a suspect herself, so of course no one would believe her claim that nothing strange happened. `
`...Naturally, Ange didn't believe her either. `
`In that case, ...shutting up like a clam would be better than the alternative. `
`It was hardly surprising...that Eva chose to say nothing. `
`"...Right now, I don't feel any sense of accomplishment. `
`...I just feel...sort of worn out and listless." `
`"Being able to withstand the truth is what makes someone a Witch of Truth. `
`...Comrade Ange, `
`it looks like you don't possess that strength after all. `
`If you did, you wouldn't be thinking about dying." `
`"...... `
`...You're right. `
`...I've dreamed that someone might come back for 12 years. `
`...I've just used {f:5:Beatrice}'s cat box to shut away the truth, denying it for all that time." `
`"...When you read the Book of the Single Truth, `
`I wonder what'll happen to you." `
`"Who knows. `
`...Won't {f:5:Bernkastel} carry out the contract by slicing my head off with a scythe or something? `
`Or will I be turned into chunks of meat again? `
`...Maybe I'll get some salt and pepper this time." `
`"...... `
`...I see, so that's where the chunks of meat thing came from." `
`"Did you say something?" `
`"Nope, nothing at all. `
`Anyway, would you like some more tea?" `
`"<No, thank you.>" `
`Ange listlessly gazed down from the balcony with no handrail, `
`...down into the darkness of the abyss at the bottom of the bookshelf ravine...no, the gap between the bookshelf skyscrapers. `
`...From the beginning until the end of my journey, I haven't taken a single step away from this spot. `
`This journey of mine, not even a single step long, ...will end soon... `
`"...Um, what are those lines of lights flowing around at the bottom?" `
`"Oh, those? `
`Probably a group of guests coming to the Great Lady {f:5:Aurora}'s party." `
`"Guests...?" `
`"Great Witches from the Senate, Voyager witches who are trying to escape boredom in their endless travels, `
`powerful witches who have woken from century-long sleeps, as well as witches who control the future world and noble witch hunters. `
`It seems she's planning to hold a grand party tonight." `
`"...What, is it a birthday party or something?" `
`"From what I've heard, while the Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}, the Endless Witch, is an outsider among witches, `
`she's also the genius who created "{f:5:Beatrice}'s cat box" out of her formidable magical compendium, an endless factory capable of producing endless tales. `
`...From my point of view, she's just stupid and a weak finisher, but in the world of great witches, she's apparently pretty famous." `
`"So this is {f:5:Beatrice}'s birthday party?" `
`"My master says she'll be holding a dinner party with {f:5:Beatrice}'s guts. `
`...After all, it's only natural, right? `
`The cat box was only able to generate infinite tales because there was no Single Truth. `
`...However, tonight... `
`the Single Truth will be revealed, thanks to your key. `
`And that means the cat box will be opened. `
`Really, it's no different from slicing open her chest as she still lives and tearing out what's inside." `
`"...Everyone in that huge crowd that looks like a packed freeway is going to one dinner party? `
`...I'm not sure what's stronger, my shock at how famous {f:5:Beatrice} is, or my revulsion at those sleazebags." `
`"For you, the Book of the Single Truth is nothing more than an end. `
`......However, for all of those enjoying the mystery of Rokkenjima, this is an event that can't be missed." `
`"I see. `
`......So, that's a crowd of those goats who were chewing Onii-chan's game board apart." `
`Ange's analogy was an accurate one. `
`The crowd far, far below them...was made up of nobles wearing beautiful outfits and goat masks. `
`They were all so intent on tearing the guts out of {f:5:Beatrice}'s cat box that they couldn't even hide the drool trickling from their mouths. `
`Those gluttonous goat nobles, who derived pleasure from the violene of exposing the truth, were in a line of cars heading towards the meeting place. `
`"...Looks like this is the end for {f:5:Beatrice} and the cat box." `
`"...Beato and the others have holed up in the Golden Land, the last remnants of the game board. `
`Battler and Beato have strengthened their defenses and have destroyed the first wave, but they won't be able to stop the second. `
`...My master has given me an armada capable of destroying the very concept of defensive measures. `
`The Golden Land's ramparts are as good as gone." `
`"......Those goats who appeared all over the island... They're the personification of random opinions in the future, and all of them want this island's tale to be a tragedy." `
`"That's right. `
`Those goats keep getting born from the sea of the internet. `
`That first wave was just the riffraff. `
`The second wave will be entirely different. `
`It's made up of the best of the best, elite goats selected from the crowd that are capable of denying all the cowering pieces one by one. `
`In total, they number in the hundreds of thousands. `
`...A hundred thousand people to deny the existence of a few dozen hiding on an island." `
`"...Looks like...this is it for Onii-chan too." `
`"Are you sure you're ready? `
`You understand that Ushiromiya Battler died in 1986, ...and that this man is an illusion created by the cat box?" `
`"......Yeah. `
`...I understand." `
`Regardless of whether he's my real brother or an illusion... Regardless of whether he's who I'd like him to be or not... `
`The Battler who created this game board for my sake...will die. `
`No, I'm just going to accept the fact that he already was dead, so it's not like he's actually going to die...... `
`Ange thought to herself. `
`Shouldn't performing her brother's last rites...be her responsibility? `
`This was her final trial, which she had assigned to herself. `
`All of those people down on the game board...were the personification of Ange's naivety. `
`By denying the existence of all of them, wouldn't she finally be able to accept the truth? `
`......... `
`No, that's not right. `
`...I'm not being honest, even with myself. `
`That bizarre Halloween party may have been an illusion, ...but that didn't make it any less heartwarming. `
`...Onii-chan said it himself. `
`True, that Halloween party may have been an illusion. `
`However. `
`He was trying to use that party to tell me something... `
`......... `
`"About that second wave..." `
`"My master has appointed me to be their commander. `
`...Leave it to me, Ange-san. `
`My master isn't so malicious that she'd make you dirty your own hands." `
`"............" `
`Yes, that might be kind of her. `
`...These are...my lingering attachments we're talking about. `
`I should be grateful to {f:5:Bernkastel}. `
`If she really were cruel, `
`she would probably have ordered me to take charge of the second wave and execute my own family. `
`"Comrade Ange, `
`you're a Witch of Truth, aren't you?" `
`"...... `
`...That's right. `
`...Probably." `
`"Then accept the truth, okay? `
`Finally, after 12 years, the Single Truth lies before you." `
`"...... `
`...I'll just sit around here until {f:5:Bernkastel} breaks the seal." `
`"You'll probably be summoned as a guest for the party. `
`...We've got a mirror, so maybe you should wipe the sleep from your eyes." `
`"And maybe you should shave before heading out to battle." `
`It floated there in the empty air. `
`...The door to the Golden Land. `
`At its base, there was nothing except some floor tiling about as thick as a rug, so it was fairly hard to imagine that this was Kinzo's study. `
`...By this point, all of the game board except the Golden Land had been eaten away, leaving only this door floating in a sea of nothingness... `
`There were two shapes in front of that door. `
`They were Battler...and Beato. `
`They may not have been literally covered with wounds, but they definitely seemed to be dead tired. `
`Battler, leaning against the door, seemed to have finally caught his breath. `
`Beato was also sitting against the door, letting her legs dangle gracelessly. `
`Could the battle against that force really be called a battle? `
`It was more like a mere pushing contest on the increasingly small bit of ground that remained. `
`...They had wanted to protect at least Kinzo's study no matter what. `
`And, the only fruit of their desperate struggle was the thin bit of flooring that they were sitting on now. `
`Those goats fell into the abyss whenever they had nowhere to stand. `
`So now, with so much of the floor gone, there was no way for them to attack anymore. `
`If Battler thought this, his naive hopes were quickly crushed. `
`"...Looks like we're surrounded." `
`"They probably plan to gather their forces and crush us in a single stroke..." `
`Stretching across the ocean horizon that surrounded the door at their backs... `
`...was an encirclement of countless large sailing ships. `
`As they could clearly see, the decks of those ships were packed with goats, `
`with some of the more foolish and overeager ones spilling over the edges into the emptiness below. `
`"Dang... `
`I've gone through a lot of crazy stuff in your games, `
`...but being surrounded by pirate ships is definitely a first for me." `
`"...They probably do possess the strength to break through the Golden Land's perimeter. `
`Those cannons are no bluff. `
`Doubtless, they will be able to use those to smash through this door and pour in." `
`Along the sides of each ship were several open gun ports, each with a cannon pointing at the door. `
`If this many ships all around them fired all of those at once... `
`...There was no point trying to imagine what would happen next. `
`Battler and Beato grimaced and hung their heads. `
`"...How long will the Golden Land perimeter hold out against those cannons?" `
`"I do not know. `
`...However, since they are still awaiting reinforcements after amassing that many soldiers, ...I doubt the barrier will break that easily." `
`"True. `
`I can't think of any other reason to delay your attack without even sending terms for surrender..." `
`"I hope we can take advantage of this time they give us." `
`"...Time is always the ally of the weaker side. `
`After all, we can always hope for a miracle." `
`"Though it might just lead us further into despair." `
`At that moment, something small and hard hit Battler in the forehead. `
`"...Ow! `
`The heck is this? Konpeitou...?!" `
`"It's me! `
`I know where Bern and the others are!" `
`The candy was {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s transformed body. `
`She was the only one of their allies capable of crossing the sea of Fragments. `
`"Spectacular! `
`That's the Great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} for you!" `
`"They can see us here. `
`Let's talk inside. `
`...This is starting to get messy." `
`"Got it. `
`...Is anyone there?!" `
`When Battler knocked on the door, it opened, and Shannon and Kanon came into view. `
`"You called for us?" `
`"My apologies, but we need you two to keep a lookout." `
`"Leave it to us." `
`"...When they begin their attack, don't worry about fighting them. `
`Escape to the Golden Land as soon as they start. `
`Don't worry about closing the door." `
`"But that means..." `
`"They're planning to ignore the door and smash the Golden Land directly. `
`Making a last stand here won't do anyone any good." `
`"...I understand." `
`"We'll take care of things here, so go inside and work on a counterattack." `
`"We shall. `
`We're counting on you." `
`Battler and Beato traded places with Shannon and Kanon and returned to the Golden Land. `
`A gentle rain poured down over the Golden Land's rose garden. `
`...The weather here reflected the hearts of those inside it. `
`The quietly falling raindrops spoke for the pain felt by those who could do nothing but hide here, waiting for the enemy's final assault... `
`When they returned to the arbor, that piece of konpeitou flew out of Battler's pocket, `
`jumped onto the table, and returned to its original form. `
`"I haven't had a thrill like this for years! `
`Hard to believe I'd find myself in such a tense situation, even after becoming a witch." `
`"Let's get down to business...! `
`Where the heck are Ange and {f:5:Bernkastel}...?!" `
`"They're in the City of Books." `
`"...I've heard of it. `
`...They say it's a place where great witches—travelers of the sea—store countless Fragments in the form of books." `
`"You mean the Great Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating's Noble City of Carefully Selected Books, yes?" `
`"The Great Lady {f:5:Aurora} is the ruler of the City of Books. `
`Indeed, that would be a fitting place for those two to go." `
`"Nice going, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}. `
`...Hard to believe you could pick out that spot so quickly from all the other possible hiding places." `
`"Actually, it was pretty easy. `
`...I didn't even have to search, since they're advertising it as loud as they can. `
`They're planning a huge party to celebrate the announcement of a great secret. The secret to the cat box of the Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}, the Endless Witch." `
`"......Hmph. `
`I see, they haven't been delaying their attack because they await reinforcements, but because the party has not yet begun." `
`"So, in this party, they plan to use Ange's key and reveal the contents of the Book of the Single Truth?" `
`"You've got it. `
`{f:5:Aurora} hasn't held an event like this for ages, and she's gathering VIP guests from all over the place. `
`...The Book of the Single Truth will probably be the party's final showpiece." `
`"...That means we still have a shot at taking Ange and the key back." `
`"Time-wise, that may be true. `
`However, there's a really simple and obvious problem." `
`"What?" `
`"The City of Books is a sacred realm under the supervision of the Senate. `
`It's protected by a holy barrier. `
`Only a witch of the Senate can enter it." `
`"...Have they invited any non-Senators to the party?" `
`"They have. `
`It looks like they're being given special "invitations", which allow them to enter the sacred realm for a limited time. `
`"...Invitations." `
`"My, my, ...now this could be interesting." `
`"That's what I thought...! `
`However, there's a strict policy on punctuality, so these invitations automatically become useless unless you present them before the party begins! `
`And, I'm afraid to say...that the party started a short while ago." `
`"In other words, it's too late to try stealing an invitation from a guest who's running late." `
`"That's right. `
`...So, what do we do now?! `
`Could someone get me popcorn? `
`I'd like some candy flavor this time!" `
`"As an outsider, I hate to barge into this conversation, ...but we seem to have no options left." `
`"...We're already done for, aren't we..." `
`"Can't we do anything except sit here until they attack?! `
`There must be something we can do...!" `
`"That's right. `
`...There is just one thing we can do." `
`"...What's that?" `
`"We can keep on strugglin' for each second of survival...and hope for a miracle." `
`"A miracle...?!" `
`"So, we're stuck defending the Alamo." `
`"Surrender isn't an option. `
`...We can only hold out as long as we can, waiting for a miracle." `
`"...Uryu-. `
`What kind of miracle?" `
`"There is a chance, maybe one in a million, `
`...that Ange will change her mind for some reason and come back." `
`"...Hmph. `
`With a probability such as that, it truly would be a miracle." `
`"We are here to await Ange-san's return." `
`"Yes. `
`...This right here is the only place Ange-san can call home. `
`So, we must defend it to the last minute, waiting for her to come back." `
`"Awaiting the return of one's master is a servant's duty...! `
`N-N-N-Now that we are here, I, Gohda, am prepared for whatever may come...!" `
`"......Battler-sama, `
`all of us are prepared." `
`"We of the Chiester Sisters Imperial Guard will fulfill our oath and remain by the Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}'s side until the bitter end!" `
`"45 here, no problems! `
`I will fight until the end." `
`"...Finally, a fitting place to die nyeh. `
`...No problems from 410 nyeh." `
`"The Seven Sisters of Purgatory will stay with {f:5:Beatrice}-sama and Battler-sama until it's all over!!" `
`The six younger sisters also showed their resolve with their eyes. `
`"Eiserne Jungfrau `
`will serve until the {f:5:end}." `
`"The former SSVD's got your back too." `
`"...And I ask that you lend us your power as well." `
`"Me?! `
`No way. `
`Didn't I just give you some excellent intel? `
`I think I've done more than my fair share, don't you?" `
`"How do you know that Ange-chan is in the City of Books?" `
`"I saw her with my own eyes, of course. `
`I never trust anything unless I see it for myself." `
`"Which means you're qualified to enter this sacred realm called the City of Books, right?" `
`"......Indeed. `
`The Great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} is a witch of the Senate, after all." `
`"{f:5:Lambdadelta}..." `
`"...What's with you guys? `
`...You aren't gonna tell me to do more work, are you...?" `
`"My, what an unexpected development...!" `
`"Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} is the only one who can enter the City of Books!" `
`"Could that possibly mean..." `
`""That this is Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s time to shine?!!"" `
`"Enough kidding around! Are you people crazy? `
`...You're telling me to go, all by myself, `
`and sneak into there one more time, `
`and then bring Ange back out here?!" `
`The several dozen people surrounding {f:5:Lambdadelta} all nodded in unison. `
`"How stupid can you be?! `
`If I save Ange, I'll be crashing the great {f:5:Aurora}'s party, get it?! `
`I'd have the whole world as my enemy! `
`And what's in it for me?! Nothing, obviously! `
`There's nothing you could possibly offer me `
`that'd be worth getting on the bad side of {f:5:Aurora} and her monster friends...!" `
`"You'll get to see a happy ending, where {f:5:Aurora} and {f:5:Bernkastel}'s schemes are crushed, `
`Ange comes back, and everyone makes peace with one another." `
`"...What do you say, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}? `
`There could be no greater thrill. `
`...If you pulled off such a marvelous feat, you would be able to forget your illness for a thousand years, would you not?" `
`"We're begging you, {f:5:Lambdadelta}...!! `
`Lend us your power!!" `
`Please, please, we're begging you! `
`Help us save Ange...! `
`Everyone surrounded {f:5:Lambdadelta}, `
`asking for her help. `
`"Please, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}...!! `
`Only you can do this...!!" `
`"Give us your strength!! `
`I'll show you the greatest of tales!! `
`And you'll get to see it from the front row!! `
`So please, lend us your strength!!" `
`"Shut uuuuuuuuuuuup!! `
`Shut the hell uuuuuuuuuuuuuup!!!" `
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} leapt to her feet and crushed the cup of popcorn in her hands. `
`Sweet, candy-flavored popcorn flew all over the place, hitting everyone in the face. `
`It might have looked funny. `
`...However, no one laughed. `
`{f:5:Lambdadelta}'s face was filled with a rage that none of them had seen before. `
`"Please, stop getting the wrong idea! `
`I'm a spectator, ...a spectator!! `
`I'm just a guest who was invited by Beato to come and watch this game! `
`So why should I risk my life for you people?! `
`You think you'll get a happy ending if Ange comes back?! `
`Are you really that stupid?! `
`Bern and her forces will come sweeping through here, mad with rage, and wipe us all out!" `
`"There's only one reason I'm here, `
`and that's because Lion over there said I'd get to see an interesting show!!" `
`"Yeah, and now I'm sure I'll get to see a sublimely interesting tale very soon...! `
`A sad, sad tragedy as you fight desperately against Bern's forces and get wiped out one by one! `
`Oh, I'm sure you'll each get one last time to shine as you're torn apart!" `
`"If I just wait a little, I'll get to see all that, won't I? `
`Pretty soon, all of you will be dead!! `
`But not me! `
`I'm a spectator, a guest!! `
`There's absolutely no reason for me to die with you!!!" `
`......No one was able to say a word. `
`In the still silence, where there was no sound except that of the rain, ...even {f:5:Lambdadelta} finally hung her head in dismay. `
`"......I'm sorry. `
`I'm totally lame, aren't I? `
`...Sure, if I stood up right now and said "Leave it to me", my popularity would surge and I'd probably make it into the top 3 in the next character ranking contest. `
`......But still, `
`...unlike the rest of you, ...I'm not "a character who appears in the story". `
`...I can't die. `
`...It's like it's midnight, and you're telling me that the climax of the show is coming up next. `
`But tomorrow's Monday, and I've got early cleaning duty at school...! `
`We live in completely different worlds...!! `
`And so, ...and so... `
`......Haaaah......" `
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} staggered as though dizzy, ...then plopped down into a chair. `
`Then, she became expressionless like a doll, just staring at a single point in space, silently... `
`"...Sorry." `
`Battler softly apologized. `
`However, {f:5:Lambdadelta} remained expressionless. `
`"...It's not fair for us to force you to risk something on your own, `
`not when we haven't yet exhausted all our options." `
`"............" `
`"We'll fight here and defend this spot until the last moment. `
`...We'll believe in the miracle of Ange choosing us over the Single Truth. `
`...If we weren't prepared to do that, we could hardly ask you to give up your life along with the rest of us." `
`Battler rose from his seat and span around. `
`"...Battler..." `
`"I'll switch places with the pair outside. `
`...When the enemy comes, I want to be in the front lines. `
`That's the fastest and most direct way I can show {f:5:Lambdadelta} my determination." `
`"............" `
`"I shall go as well. `
`Teacher, please find Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} some more popcorn." `
`"...Beato..." `
`"I know Ange will return. `
`Without belief, even miracles that might have occurred will not. `
`You can't win a lottery unless you buy a ticket." `
`Beato also stood up and followed Battler. `
`"...Everyone, `
`let's do what we can to prepare for the fight." `
`"Yeah. `
`It'd be stupid to just sit around here doing nothing...!" `
`"Good point. `
`Let's at least give 'em a good show at the end." `
`"......We've got to make sure there's a place Ange-chan can call home." `
`"We should hold a strategic conference {f:5:too}." `
`"Yeah. `
`We have furniture, weapons, demons, and inquisitors on our side. `
`There's got to be some way for these mismatched forces to cooperate." `
`"Let's go, little sisters. `
`Break time is over." `
`"Chiester Troops, rise." `
`The Humans and Illusions all rose to their feet and left the arbor. `
`Afterwards, only {f:5:Lambdadelta} remained, still staring blankly at a point in empty space... `
`"That black tea smells nice. `
`Is it instant? Or from a tea bag?" `
`"...Oh, would you like some too, comrade {f:5:Eva}? `
`We're out of cups, so you'll have to use a funnel." `
`A gold butterfly drifted onto the balcony and turned into {f:5:Eva}. `
`"How's {f:5:Bernkastel} doing? `
`Will it be a while longer before she breaks the seal on the Book of the Single Truth...?" `
`"That's what I came to talk about. `
`She says the seal has been broken." `
`"............" `
`"Congratulations. So, the time has finally come. `
`...The period to mark the end of your life." `
`"Take the key and go to Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}. `
`...One of her cat familiars will guide you." `
`Two emerald sparkles flew in. `
`They were the green, glinting eyes of a black cat. `
`The cat flicked its tail elegantly, with the dignity of a high-class attendant. `
`"...Got it. `
`Then, I'll be back in a bit." `
`Ange rose from her seat. `
`She did it casually, as though she really was just heading out for a short trip. `
`However, her lips would probably never touch her half-finished cup of tea again... `
`"We weren't together long, but I enjoyed it. `
`Getting to learn what disgust for your own kind is like was an enlightening experience." `
`"Same here. `
`...Next time we meet, you'll have to teach me the trick to making tea this terrible." `
`"...Are you happy? `
`Now, you'll finally get to learn that secret I've been hiding from you these past 12 years." `
`"I'm happy. `
`...Yeah, now I can understand how Erika feels. `
`...It's like I'm taking a shot back at you, exposing the secret that you kept until your death." `
`"And is it a good feeling?" `
`"...Well, it's better than nothing." `
`Ange nodded towards the black cat to let it know that she was ready. `
`The cat nodded back in a refined manner, indicated that it wanted Ange to follow, and leapt from the balcony. `
`Without turning back, Ange followed it, jumping out into the air as though swimming... `
`{f:5:Eva} watched her go. `
`An expression of ridicule and scorn...failed to cross her face... `
`"Good luck, Ange. `
`......This is the path you've chosen. `
`You aren't six years old anymore. `
`You're 18. `
`...Choose how to live your own life." `
`"......What an overprotective aunt you are." `
`"I'm going to watch the ceremony. `
`What about you?" `
`"It's almost time to begin the attack, so I'm heading for the ships. `
`......I've got to go pick up Beato's corpse. `
`Everyone at the party can have her guts, `
`but I get to keep her skin, so let's stuff and mount it." `
`"So, even Rokkenjima's tale, which was wrapped in a veil of mysteries, is about to meet its end." `
`"......Which means it's also the end for you. I mean, you are a piece from there, right?" `
`"A piece is all I am. `
`The role of a piece is to remain faithful to its role until the game ends. `
`...It's not a piece's place to worry about what happens after the game is over." `
`"True. `
`...And it's the same for me. `
`...Let's both enjoy this time while we have it. `
`Well then, allow me to take my leave." `
`"Later. Good luck with your work." `
`After exchanging elegant bows, the two witches vanished at the same time. `
`Nothing remained except some half-finished tea cups and the aroma of the tea itself... `
`One after another, luxury cars stopped in front of a high-class hotel in the city, and guests began to step out of them. `
`"Hey, Professor Ootsuki...!" `
`"Oh, what a surprise! `
`I haven't seen you since the last convention!" `
`All of the guests gathered here were very rich and cultured. `
`A single hobby tied all of them together. `
`They were Witch Hunters. `
`Like-minded people who enjoyed exploring various interpretations of the Rokkenjima mystery. `
`"Still, I wonder if it's really true. `
`To think that this diary of Ushiromiya Eva's actually exists...!" `
`"True, true, I have heard the rumors myself. `
`This is that legendary secret diary, which Ushiromiya Eva hid away just before her death...! `
`It is said that she recorded the details of Rokkenjima's truth in there. `
`Just like that fable of the king with the donkey's ears. `
`Humans are tragic creatures, incapable of keeping truly silent regarding secrets only they could know." `
`"Wahahahahahahahaha. `
`From what I've heard, a collector from Dubai offered to buy it for ten million dollars...!" `
`"Incredible...! `
`More evidence of the fascination that the Rokkenjima mystery is capable of stirring!" `
`Conversations like this were breaking out passionately all over the place. `
`Furthermore, it wasn't just guests who were allowed to enter. `
`The press was also there in force. `
`The Rokkenjima mystery was such a large movement that it became a social phenomenon at one point. `
`Though it had died down slightly in recent years, it was still a topic fiercely debated across the internet. `
`It was hardly any surprise that the discovery and eminent release of Ushiromiya Eva's diary, which contained the truth of that mystery, had caused an uproar. `
`And on top of all that, the mysterious Forger Itouikukuro was to appear publicly for the first time. `
`In fact, it seemed that Itouikukuro and Hachijo Tohya, the up-and-coming mystery novelist, were the same person. `
`Of course, this meant that Hachijo Tohya would also be appearing in public for the first time. `
`Though she was thought to be a male author, the fact that she was actually a mysterious woman author alone was enough to cause a stir. `
`Before the diary unveiling party, a press conference was held in one of the rooms of the hotel. `
`"...Indeed. `
`I am Hachijo Tohya." `
`"Madam Hachijo, we now know that in your previous book signings, you were so determined not to show yourself that you even used a body double, `
`so what has caused you to change your mind and appear before us this time...?!" `
`"The legend of the Rokkenjima witch has given birth to endless tales. `
`...Considering the weight of such a legend's demise, `
`and being the mere writer that I am, I felt obligated to show myself as a sign of respect." `
`"As a Forger, you announced on the web that you had reached the truth! `
`Does that mean you've already read the contents of that diary?!" `
`"...And, very soon, those contents will be revealed to everyone." `
`"Pardon me for asking, `
`but is there any guarantee that the contents of this diary are the truth? `
`One might view it as nothing more than a personal account from a single deceased person." `
`"Not at all. `
`I guarantee it. `
`{p:1:The truth is recorded in this diary.}" `
`A stir passed through the crowd, and the room was suddenly filled with camera flashes. `
`"This ends Madam Hachijo's interview...! `
`Allow us to express our deep gratitude towards all members of the press for coming on this day! `
`And now, we would like to move on and allow you to take photos of Madam Ushiromiya Eva's diary." `
`A hotel worker pushed forward a cart covered by a veil. `
`Then, after looking to Hachijo for approval, he removed the veil. `
`There lay...Ushiromiya Eva's diary. `
`The Book of the Single Truth sat there, waiting for its seal to be released. `
`Hachijo held it to her chest and laughed enigmatically. `
`Camera flashes came from everywhere, making the Book of the Single Truth glint... `
`"And that is all for now! `
`If you would all please move to the assembly hall...!" `
`Still holding the diary, Hachijo left the press conference room, escorted by men from the hotel. `
`Until she went through a door that said "Authorized Personnel Only", `
`the journalists continued to surround her and ask questions, hoping to gather just one more comment. `
`When the door slammed shut, ...the world twisted. `
`The hotel employees became black cats wearing capes. `
`Hachijo had turned into {f:5:Featherine}... `
`"Things are getting pretty crazy out there. `
`...Did you enjoy it?" `
`"...How tiring. `
`...Still, that went well. `
`And yet, this diary truly is heavy." `
`{f:5:Featherine} tossed the diary, and {f:5:Bernkastel} caught it. `
`"I will rest in one of the waiting rooms." `
`"You're going to be up again pretty soon. `
`There's no time to rest." `
`"...In that case, call it a short break so that I can properly enjoy this long-awaited excitement." `
`"I need to borrow that book. `
`I promised Ange that I'd show her first." `
`"I see. `
`In that case, do as you please." `
`{f:5:Featherine} left, followed by her cat attendants. `
`After watching her until she was out of sight, {f:5:Bernkastel} disappeared as well. `
`Like Erika's room, {f:5:Bernkastel}'s was a balcony without a handrail, dug out of a bookshelf cliff. `
`Ange had been kept waiting for some time, but she had waited patiently, looking down at the world below her... `
`{a:c: `
`"...I'm late, aren't I? `
`Sorry about that."} `
`After {f:5:Bernkastel} appeared, the black cats gave a bow and vanished. `
`"Here you go. `
`I've brought it with me. `
`The Book of the Single Truth." `
`"...... `
`...Can I touch it...?" `
`"Do as you like." `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} set it on the table and beckoned Ange forward. `
`Slowly, ...Ange approached it. `
`"So, ...this is Aunt Eva's diary..." `
`"That's right. `
`...Inside it, you'll find the Single Truth that you wanted. `
`...You do have the key, right?" `
`"Yes. `
`Right here." `
`Ange took the key out, looked at it there on her palm, then gripped it tightly. `
`Even the heavy lock that held the diary so securely...was fated to be swept aside easily as soon as Ange readied herself... `
`"I won't rush you. `
`You don't have to open it until you're ready." `
`"This...includes the truth of what happened at midnight on October 5, 1986, right?" `
`"......Yes. `
`It has everything that you wanted to know so much, you offered up your life." `
`In that instant, two Anges appeared inside of her, taking control of her body at the same time. `
`On the one hand, she knew that she had already paid a great price to learn the truth. `
`This part of her gripped the key, wanting to avoid a second of hesitation that might lead her to refuse to learn the truth now, `
`at the final moment, with the Book of the Single Truth right before her. `
`On the other hand, `
`...a feeling as though she was betraying the brother and family who watched over her warmly...made her bite her lower lip. `
`However, though she shook, she could do nothing but watch as her right hand slowly brought the key towards the lock. `
`"........." `
`"............" `
`What am I hesitating for...? `
`Inside this diary is the final destination of my sad, painful, 12-year-long journey. `
`Wasn't 12 years enough? Do I want to keep living that way...? `
`That brother is an illusion created by my heart. `
`...My naive hope that a miracle might still occur. `
`If I put my two options on a scale, then the path I should choose is clear. `
`Slowly, ...I pushed the key into the lock...and twisted... `
`The lock opened with a click, ...and at the same time, it felt as though a crack ran through the key in my hands. `
`Maybe a part of that intricate design had fallen off. `
`I couldn't tell where it was broken just by glancing at it. `
`However, for some reason, its golden glint seemed dulled somehow. `
`"...It's because you've made your choice with that key. `
`A bit of magic has disappeared." `
`"What kind of magic?" `
`"Didn't Battler tell you? `
`He said you couldn't hand that over to anyone else. `
`...That magic, which "left the decision to you", has just fulfilled its role and disappeared. `
`That key is just a key now. `
`It can't do anything but lock and unlock that diary." `
`"...I see. `
`Then, I guess I have no more use for Onii-chan's key." `
`"Can I have it? `
`Once you've read the diary, I'll lock it up again. `
`Opening that lock will be a big part of tonight's ceremony, it seems." `
`"...I see. `
`Do whatever you want." `
`I don't give a damn what happens after I find the truth. `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} slid the key from where it lay on the table and put it into her pocket. `
`"Go ahead, then. `
`...Before the courage that led you here fades." `
`"........." `
`I lifted up Aunt Eva's now unlocked diary. `
`The lock was unset. `
`Even the hinge had been released by now. `
`...Nothing stands in the way of me opening to the pages within... `
`I thought of taking a deep breath. `
`However, I decided against it. `
`...I prepared myself for this long ago. `
`It'd be so stupid to fuel my reluctance further. `
`I opened it. `
`Violently, ruthlessly. `
`I knew...that this was the right way to open to the pages that held the truth. `
`As soon as the cover was opened, ...a brilliant light poured out, and my mind went hazy. `
`The truth was sent to my mind directly, without letters or words... `
`Tell me...what happened that day...on Rokkenjima... `
`My consciousness returned gradually. `
`Nothing was written in the open book before me. `
`Of course. `
`This was...my own blank and empty notebook. `
`I was at school, just sitting idly with my notebook open. `
`The world had stopped. `
`The hands on the clock had stopped too. `
`In that case, the auditorium should have been filled with silence. `
`However, I could hear a small commotion. `
`In this world of suspended time, ...I could see dark shapes sneaking about in the shadows of the unmoving students. `
`They were...students with goat heads. `
`They were sneaking glances at me from behind the frozen students, whispering something to each other. `
`I know. `
`I can hear them. `
`Everybody...everybody knows. `
`One after another, students with goat heads grew out of shadows all over the room. `
`They slipped around all the students stopped in time...and gathered around me. `
`Then, they all jeered out something in unison, and, as if they knew I could hear, showered me with giggles and gossip and sneers. `
`However, nothing that came from the goats' mouths reached my ears as words. `
`This was a world without letters or words, ...so no words reached me. `
`However, their emotions and meanings did reach me. `
`So, I knew what it was they were saying. `
`And then, when I was able to visualize it... `
`One after another, the goats opened their massive jaws, showing their fangs that dripped with saliva, `
`...and came forward to bite me. `
`Time was stopped for me. `
`I was aware, but I could not move. `
`...That wasn't literally true. `
`However, I was pretending that I couldn't hear, ...so I couldn't move. `
`The goats bit me all over my body, leaving their fang marks, licking me. `
`Maybe they didn't like the taste of my clothes. `
`Taking advantage of the fact that I couldn't move, ...they chewed through my clothes one by one. `
`Over and over again, ...the goats stuck their tongues, their jaws, their fangs into my naked body. `
`I was covered with drool and bitten all over. `
`Bright red teeth marks were left behind as sharp fangs pierced my skin, leaving trails of blood. `
`They licked up that blood like real goats, ...hurting and humiliating me. `
`As I hung my head, one of the goats pulled on my hair, forcing me to look up, and spoke. `
`They didn't say it with concepts, but with words I could hear. `
`However, they weren't words of the human world. `
`They were a witch's words. `
`The red truth, which signifies truth that is certain. `
`"This is...{p:1:the truth of the Rokkenjima incident!!}" `
`"......I won't accept it." `
`"It doesn't matter if you accept it or not!! `
`This is the truth!! `
`{p:1:After all, *********, ******************!! `
`*********************************!!!}" `
`"...I won't accept it, I won't! ...I won't accept a truth like that...like that..." `
`"{p:1:Whether you accept it or not, that doesn't change the truth!! `
`After all, this is the Single Truth, proven in reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeddd!!}" `
`*giggle*giggle* ...Heheheheheheheheh, hahhahahahahahahaha...!! `
`Who cares about the truth?! So stupid, so pointless...! `
`I'm the one who gets to decide if that's the truth or not, right? `
`Even if it's red truth, I won't acknowledge it, won't forgive it, definitely won't accept it...!! `
`"The red truth is absolute?! `
`Who for?! `
`It's absolute for you guys, right? `
`Not for me!! `
`I won't let you contaminate my truth with yours!!" `
`"......Ange, calm down. `
`You're the one who wanted to know, right?" `
`"Hahahaha, ahhahahahahahahaha!! `
`My truth is that Aunt Eva's the culprit!! `
`Aunt Eva killed everyone!! `
`Everything's her fault!! `
`Dad and Mom and Onii-chan and all the others are just victims...!! `
`It's no one's fault, no one's fault...!! `
`Of course it isn't, of course it isn't!!" `
`—Your aunt will always be on your side, Ange-chan. `
`"Hahahaha, ahhahhahahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`Yeah, I get it now, I know what you meant! `
`Heheheheheh, ahhahahahahahahahahahahah!! `
`That's right, Aunt Eva, you're the culprit, you're the culprit!! `
`It's the world that's messed up and broken for not realizing that...!! `
`I'm the right one, I'll deny the red truth, deny the whole world...!!!" `
`"......I see. `
`...In that case, try writing a red truth only you can write. `
`...But how is it possible for a Human to write with red truth?" `
`"It is possible!! `
`There's a red ink that only Humans can write with!!" `
`Ange-san, please calm down. `
`"I'm the right one!! The world's wrong!! `
`I'll write it!! `
`I'll record the truth with the real red truth!! `
`Hahahahahahahah, ahahahahahahahaha!!" `
`20, requesting urgent support on the roof!! `
`Ange-san!! `
`Hold on!! `
`Please think this over, look ooooooooout!!! `
`"<Goodbye, Ange. Have a nice day.>" `
`"I'll write it out! This is my blood-red truth!! `
`I'll never accept the truth of your woooooooooooooooorld!!!" `
`Ange's body went past the edge of the balcony. `
`The air, which she had once been able to swim through, was now completely merciless for some reason. `
`Ange's body...plunged straight into the darkness below. `
`"........." `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} just watched the scene play out in silence... `
`Behind her, men in black suits rushed up to the fence, clutching it and screaming... `
`"...T-Twenty...! `
`...A-Ange-san...j-jumped off...!" `
`"Damn, ...I can't see her from here..." `
`"Q-Quickly, investigate the ground area...!! `
`It's no use, there's no way...!!" `
`"M-Maybe she was caught by that safety net...! `
`L-Let's make sure...!" `
`What fools. `
`If you jumped straight down from this height, ...do you really think such a flimsy safety net could possibly save you...? `
`"As the Witch of Miracles, I, {f:5:Bernkastel}, guarantee that such a miracle certainly won't occur. `
`......*giggle*giggle*giggle*, ...hahhahahahahahahahahaahahaha!!" `
`Ange's body...fell from the skyscraper-like bookshelf and slammed against the floor of the City of Books. `
`Looking down from {f:5:Bernkastel}'s balcony, which was as high as a skyscraper's roof, `
`...did it look like a lovely red pressed flower? `
`No. You couldn't see it at all. `
`Just like how the death of a single lonely girl who rejected the world...didn't matter to anyone in the world. `
`She probably died instantly. `
`It was only natural. `
`She had fallen straight down from this height, after all. `
`...Is it even conceivable that she wouldn't die instantly after something like that? `
`The index finger on the right hand of her corpse stuck out, as though it was tracing something. `
`Could it be that, by some impossible miracle, she really had escaped an instant death? `
`And could the red blood that had drained from her at the moment of her death...have been the ink that drew her own personal red truth? `
`However, no one would ever be able to tell what she had written. `
`After all, ...the red blood pouring from her corpse had run over it all. `
`"......Even this...was one of your choices, `
`...Ange." `
`{f:5:Eva} was looking down at the beautiful flower of blood radiating from Ange's corpse. `
`"...I tried to keep you alive. `
`...However, you never tried to live in the future that began after the age of six. `
`...And so, after 12 years, you've finally returned to where you started." `
`The eyes on Ange's corpse...were closed. `
`...However, there was no way of knowing if this was a peaceful thing. `
`Eventually, the corpse began to melt away. `
`At the end, it had become a messy lump of flesh, with only a few parts recognizable as human. `
`...It was hardly surprising. `
`How else would she look after falling from that height...and slamming against the asphalt? `
`"You managed to die. `
`...However, `
`this doesn't mean that everyone will be waiting for you in heaven. `
`...After all, you reached this place by rejecting all of those in heaven. `
`...<See you in hell.> `
`No, that's probably where we are right now. `
`...So long, Ange." `
`"Ah, {f:5:Eva}. `
`Perfect timing." `
`"Did you call for me, my master?" `
`"Clean up this scrap meat for me, if you wouldn't mind. `
`I'm going to take this back." `
`In {f:5:Bernkastel}'s hands were the key, which had lost its magic when Ange made her decision, and the Book of the Single Truth, which had been locked up again. `
`"As you wish, my master." `
`After looking down one more time, {f:5:Bernkastel} vanished. `
`Once she had gone, {f:5:Eva} summoned some cat familiars and ordered them to clean up. `
`The black cats gathered Ange's flesh and scattered limbs and threw them into a tin bucket. `
`...Even in this miserable form... `
`Ange's soul...was still living. `
`Perhaps "living" is a poor description. `
`She...was unable to die. `
`From now on, forever. `
`She would drift along in the deepest depths of oblivion, covered by the dust of oblivion, until she finally...disappeared. `
`She continued to question herself. `
`What did the truth mean to her? `
`What was right, and where was the place she could call home...? `
`As her flesh began to cool, even the energy to ask these questions...began to fade... `
`Eventually, ...she would forget her everyday memories, and even the reason why she was suffering. `
`However, there was one thing she would never forget. `
`That was...the anguish. `
`From this point forth, ...she would suffer endlessly without even knowing why. `
`By the time the cats finished flinging her corpse into the bucket and dumping it into the sea of nothingness, `
`...Ange had forgotten even her own name...... `
`...What's this sound I keep hearing? `
`Yes, it must be......the sound of rain... `
`In that case, what are those two bright lights coming towards me? `
`...I don't know. `
`However, they came at me with a screeching sound...and stopped right in front of me. `
`A blaring noise came at me over and over. `
`Whatever's shining those bright lights...is threatening me. `
`It's probably telling me to get out of the way. `
`However, I was incapable of moving even a finger... `
`There was sound...and a car door opened. `
`Car. `
`...Door. `
`Apparently, I was lying on asphalt under the pouring rain. `
