`"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!! `
`Fall, fall, faaaaaaaaaaalllll!!!" `
`Once again, Captain Kawabata's ferryboat to Rokkenjima cut across the sea in perfect form. `
`Yes. `
`The tale of October 4th, 1986...always begins with Battler's screams. `
`But this time, one thing was different. `
`There was another yell alongside Battler's. `
`Battler was screaming. `
`The other was...laughing? `
`"Fall, fall, faaaaaaallll!! `
`Nooooooooooooooooooooooo...!!" `
`"Fun, fun, fuuuuuunnn!! `
`*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!" `
`"Battler's face looks funny!! `
`*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*!!" `
`Alongside the big brother, who was grasping at the handrail and screaming in a way no one that age should scream, `
`was the little sister, also grasping the handrail and jumping about like it was a ride at an amusement park. George and the others just couldn't hold in their laughter at the difference. `
`"I guess Battler-kun hasn't changed much these past six years. He's as energetic as ever." `
`"Plus, Ange and Maria look more cheery than usual this year." `
`"Could this be the first time we've had all five cousins together?" `
`"Oh, is it? `
`I get it. `
`That explains why it's noisier this year than any year before." `
`"G-George-anikiiiiiiiii!! `
`This is way too fast, right?! `
`I'm begging you, ask the driver to slow down before it's too laaaate!!" `
`"Kihihahahahahahahaha! `
`This is too fast? Battler's so pathetic!" `
`"I wanna go faster!! `
`Faster, faster! `
`*giggle*giggle*!!" `
`"Any faster than this, and I'll fall right off the boat!! `
`Will that make you happy?! `
`I'm gonna faaaaaaaaaaaalllll!!!" `
`"Hahaha. `
`Going by popular vote, I'd have to say that Battler-kun's proposal is-" `
`"Rejected! `
`Ahahahahahahaha." `
`"Look out, Onii-chan. Look, you're gonna fall! `
`Ahhahahahahahahaha!!" `
`"Scaredy-cat Battler needs to be punished!! Tickle time! `
`Kihihihihi-!!" `
`"W-Wait, stop, Maria!! `
`You too, Ange! `
`N-Noooooooooooooooooooo!!" `
`"Thank goodness. `
`I was worried about Ange's health, but..." `
`"It'd be too sad to leave her behind at home. `
`I'm glad we decided to bring her anyway." `
`"Wasn't she very sick shortly before you left?" `
`"She was all better this morning. `
`Kids can be so incredible sometimes." `
`"She's the kind of person whose health takes a hit when she's stressed! `
`It's not that strange for people like that to get all better when the big day finally comes." `
`"She must really have been looking forward to playing with all five of the cousins together." `
`"Hohoho. `
`Just watching them play together makes you feel charged with energy, doesn't it?" `
`The adults smiled as they watched the children play around. `
`Ange, who had gotten very sick, and who everyone had thought would be absent, made a miraculous recovery. `
`Thanks in part to her strong desire to join in, she had come along to the family conference with the others. `
`And so... `
`For the first time ever, all five cousins were gathered together. `
`October 4th, 1986, became a day like no other. `
`The kids dashed up the path leading from the harbor to the rose garden. `
`They were probably so charged up that even walking was too boring for them. `
`"Wahhahahaha! `
`See that?! `
`First place!" `
`Battler was the first one to reach the rose garden, which was the goal. `
`Apparently, he was trying to make up for the dishonor he had suffered on the boat by proving his superiority on land. `
`A short while later, Ange and Maria reached him in a dead heat. `
`"I'm second!! `
`I'm faster than Ange, uu-uu-uu-!!" `
`"No, you aren't! Maria onee-chan cheated!! `
`I'm second!!" `
`The three year gap between Ange and Maria was large, especially since both of them were growing kids. `
`It was only natural that Maria was faster, but Ange seemed to be complaining about a shoulder bump at the start line. `
`Maria onee-chan cheated, so she gets last place! `
`Teacher always says you get last place if you cheat! ...Protested Ange. `
`"Come on, no need to fight. `
`Still, both of you really are fast...!" `
`"It's been a long time since I've run that much... `
`Ah, the breeze feels so nice." `
`"Are you out of shape, George-aniki? `
`You know, anyone who has to run the race-to-make-it-before-the-bell every day gets strong legs by default." `
`"In other words, being a fast runner is proof that you sleep in a lot." `
`"Onii-chan always sleeps in! `
`He didn't wake up today either, so I had to wake him up! `
`Right?!" `
`"A stomp followed by a flying elbow. `
`And that body-plex from the top rope at the end there just about finished me." `
`"That sounds more likely to put you in an eternal sleep..." `
`"Sounds fun! `
`I wanna do it too!" `
`"I'll bet Onii-chan sleeps in tomorrow too! `
`We'll wake him up together this time, okay?! *giggle*giggle*!" `
`"...I'd recommend against staying up too late tonight." `
`Finally, the adults came into sight. `
`The cousins waved at them, urging them to hurry up. `
`Ange and Maria were so excited that they could hardly wait. `
`Just by having all five cousins together... `
`Just by adding Ange into the group... `
`Look at how energetic this day has become. `
`"Excuse me. `
`The family members have arrived." `
`"So, they made it. `
`I must let Father know." `
`"Are they all in the guesthouse now?" `
`"Yes. `
`They will meet you here after they have set down their luggage." `
`"Understood. `
`Kanon, please show them the way. `
`Shannon, quickly get some tea ready." `
`""As you wish, Madam."" `
`"Father. It's me, Krauss. `
`It's about time for you to get ready." `
`After Krauss knocked on the door, it opened from the inside. `
`"Oh, Doctor Nanjo. `
`How is Father doing?" `
`"No need to worry. `
`He's changing as we speak. `
`I think he's just a little nervous." `
`"Who are you calling nervous?!! `
`Nooo, I cannot find my favorite One-Winged necktie pin! `
`How many times must I tell Natsuhi? `
`My possessions must never be moved without my approval...!" `
`Apparently, Kinzo had been running around for some time, just because he couldn't decide on a tie and a tie pin. `
`Kinzo, who felt that the dignity of the Family Head must always be preserved, usually made a big deal about the Head's attire being equally dignified. `
`"...Will he make it in time?" `
`"Do you think you could give us a little longer? `
`We'll come down as soon as he's ready." `
`"Understood. `
`I'm counting on you, Doctor Nanjo. `
`...Father, `
`I must say, that necktie pin looks splendid on you." `
`"This necktie pin, you say?! This pin?!! `
`The family conference is held but once a year! `
`There shall be no compromise! I must have 'that' necktie pin!! `
`Where is it, ...where?!!" `
`"Kinzo-san, you already looked in that drawer five seconds ago... `
`Besides, you own several splendid necktie pins. `
`Is it not stylish to select something fitting to match fate's whims?" `
`"Hmmmmmm, you think so? `
`So, I don't need to use the One-Winged Eagle pin...? `
`Hmmmmm..." `
`As Krauss watched Nanjo calm Kinzo down, `
`he started finding it hard to believe that this doctor wasn't his own mother. `
`Well, it was always like this. `
`He always makes a fuss when no one's looking, but when the time comes, he makes his decision with pride. `
`After asking Nanjo to come down by lunch at the latest, Krauss snuck out of the study... `
`"What do you think? A splendid aroma, is it not?! `
`And a unique one, as well!" `
`"I've never had pumpkin tea before... `
`That little touch of sweetness makes it delicious." `
`As one step in preparing the tea for the guests, Gohda let Shannon try a bit first. `
`Until then, Shannon had thought it would be outrageous for a servant such as herself to drink the same thing as the family and their guests. `
`However, according to Gohda, that kind of thinking was a mistake. `
`"One must not serve something if one does not know the taste beforehand. `
`...For example, when you visit a restaurant and a dish you've never heard of catches your eye, `
`what are you likely to ask the waiter? `
`'How does this dish taste', correct?" `
`"I see... `
`So, if the waiter says that he's never eaten it before, that would seem a bit odd..." `
`"Precisely. `
`As a matter of course, anyone serving their customers must be deeply acquainted with the taste of the tea and food they serve." `
`"Hohohoho. `
`And, you'll always feel happier serving a sort of tea that you've tried and enjoyed for yourself." `
`"That's right. `
`After tasting tea this delicious, I can't wait to let everyone else try it." `
`"And because of that! `
`We servants must be very familiar with the tastes of all sorts of foods. `
`That's why 'sampling' food whenever I can is part of my job description, ...hohoho." `
`"It's a perk as well as our job. `
`Do you understand?" `
`"Yes!" `
`"...Everything is proceeding smoothly. `
`Are there any problems with the tea?" `
`"Oh, Genji-san, you must try some as well. `
`Seeing as it's almost Halloween, I decided to make some pumpkin tea." `
`"Later, perhaps. `
`The family will be arriving at the mansion very soon. `
`...It looks as though the children will be joining in." `
`"Yes sir. `
`The cups are ready to go as well." `
`At that moment, the kitchen's extension line started to ring. `
`Genji, who was standing right beside it, swiftly picked up the receiver before the second ring. `
`Shannon and the others always thought Genji looked like a samurai when he did this. `
`"...Understood. `
`Take care when guiding them." `
`After giving that short response, Genji set the receiver down. `
`"That was Kanon. `
`The relatives will be here shortly. `
`The children are with them. `
`Shannon, Kumasawa, go to serve them. `
`Gohda, hurry up with that tea." `
`"""Yes sir!""" `
`The family conference. It was the largest event of the year for the servants. `
`They were all excited and determined to make it through together once again this year. `
`"Krauss-sama, `
`I have led the relatives here." `
`"Oho, there you are. `
`Were there any troubles on your trip here?" `
`"Nii-san, you've been doing pretty well for yourself lately, haven't you? `
`Isn't it about time you bought a private jet?" `
`"Wahahahaha. `
`After all, no one was in the plane but the family, as usual!" `
`"I'm glad `
`Ange-chan made it. `
`I was so worried when I heard she was too sick to come." `
`"Thanks for your concern. `
`She suddenly got all better this morning." `
`"My tummy ache went away! `
`I rubbed my tummy clockwise!" `
`"Uu-uu-! `
`That's a magical ritual to heal tummy aches!" `
`"Now, Maria, quiet down..." `
`"Oh, is that Battler-kun...?! `
`You've grown so big!" `
`"It's been six years, hasn't it? `
`You've grown splendidly." `
`"Well, ...ihihi. `
`I do keep getting bigger, at least..." `
`"Can't really say that about his guts though!" `
`"I'm just happy to learn that he's still the same old Battler-kun." `
`Wahhahahahahahahaha. `
`Battler may be bigger, but he's still Battler. `
`"This brat's always been terrified of falling off planes and boats and stuff." `
`"That must be Asumu-san's blood, right?" `
`"When he was a kid and we went to theme parks, we always went on some of the wilder rides. `
`That's probably what did it." `
`"Don't they have height restrictions for those?" `
`"No, I don't mean that kind. `
`You know those paddle boats and teacup rides, right? `
`Looks like we took those a bit too rough back in the day." `
`"You've always gone a bit overboard on rides like that, Rudolf nii-san." `
`"I see... `
`Poor Battler-kun." `
`"Haha, poor Battler-kun indeed." `
`"Still, it's comforting, in a way. `
`Even after all this time, nothing says 'Battler-kun' like a fear of riding things." `
`"Onii-chan isn't scared of riding things. `
`He's just scared of falling off them!" `
`"Faaall, faaall!! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!!" `
`"Hey, stop running around...! `
`Maria! You're one of the big cousins now, right? `
`Set a good example!" `
`"Pardon me. `
`I've brought some tea for everyone." `
`A pleasant aroma followed Shannon as she came into the room, pushing a serving cart. `
`Even Ange and Maria, who had been running around in circles, sat down obediently when they heard that drinks were here. `
`"By the way, what's Dad doing?" `
`"He should be down here soon. `
`He's been rushing about all morning trying to choose a tie." `
`"You mean, all that about choosing 'an attire suitable for the Family Head'?" `
`"Father's always been picky about ties, hasn't he?" `
`"It's just something he has a passion for. `
`Staying stylish is a good thing." `
`"And yet, he always shows up wearing the same tie in the end." `
`The family members burst out laughing. `
`The sweet scent of Gohda's specially-made pumpkin tea spread throughout the parlor, and the calm atmosphere grew more cheery and excited. `
`"Look, Mama! Look, Mama! `
`It's a pumpkin cookie! For Halloween!!" `
`"Oh, that's right. `
`This sweet scent is kabocha, isn't it?" `
`"That's right. `
`Today, we have some special pumpkin-flavored tea for you to try. `
`It really is delicious, so I suggest you try some without sugar first." `
`"Nee-san, `
`watch your sleeve." `
`"Wow, `
`so kabocha tea actually does exist. `
`Gohda-san really did his homework." `
`"Delicious. `
`This is excellent. `
`You can taste the kabocha's natural sweetness." `
`"Kabocha tea, huh? `
`Still, kabocha always tastes best in tempura!" `
`"Uu-! `
`It's 'pumpkin', not 'kabocha'!" `
`"Yeah, pumpkin is different from kabocha! `
`This is pumpkin!" `
`Maria was apparently speaking in English, but Ange, being normal, was not. Maria seemed to think the English word was more fitting for Halloween, `
`but it looked like Ange thought kabocha and pumpkins were entirely different things. `
`Everyone laughed, but Ange, not knowing why she was being laughed at, cocked her head to one side discontentedly. `
`Just when it looked like she was about get in a bad mood and start grumbling, Maria started teaching her a 'cookie game', and Ange immediately became engrossed with that distraction. `
`Then, the sound of approaching footsteps drifted in from the hallway. `
`When the relatives realized whose footsteps those must be, they straightened up. `
`Those quick footsteps stopped for a moment just outside the parlor door. `
`...As though someone was taking a deep breath and setting up a dramatic pause. `
`Then, the door exploded open as Kinzo yelled out loud, with Genji and Nanjo standing behind him. `
`"<Hhhhhhappy Halloween!! `
`And trick-or-treeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaat!!>" `
`"""<Trick-or-treeeeat>!!""" `
`The cousins shouted it back. `
`The adults returned the greeting too, looking embarrassed and refusing to meet his gaze. `
`Ange alone stood there with her mouth open, `
`unable to comprehend what had just happened. `
`"Welcome, my grandchildren!! `
`If you don't give me a treat, I shall trick yooooou!!" `
`"Go ahead, Maria." `
`"Happy Halloween, Grandfather!! `
`I got you a really incredible one this year! You'll be surprised!!" `
`Maria picked up a present that had been hidden behind a sofa. `
`Come to think of it, all of the relatives were now holding similar packages. `
`"Come on, Ange, you too. `
`Give this to Grandfather." `
`Kyrie handed Ange a neatly-wrapped present. `
`"Ooooooh, Mariaaaaaaaaa, you're always so thoughtful!! `
`Grandpa's so happyyyyyyyyyy!!" `
`As Kinzo took Maria's present, a smile broke out across his face, and he rubbed his cheek up against it. `
`"...Master, `
`your dignity." `
`"Nngg... O-Oh, that's right. `
`...You have pleased your grandfather greatly, my granddaughter. `
`In return for the treat you have given me, I promise not to trick you at all this coming year." `
`"Now it's your turn, Grandfather!! `
`If you don't give me a treat, I'll prank you!!" `
`"Indeed, I'm well aware. `
`Genji...!" `
`"Here." `
`Genji fished through something that looked like Santa Claus's sack and pulled out a present addressed to Maria, `
`handing it over to Kinzo. `
`"Heeere you go, Mariaaa!! `
`Here's a present from meeeeeee!! `
`I'm warning yoooou, it's so cuuuuute!! `
`Such a waste to give it up to you{p:0:♪}" `
`"......Master. Dignity." `
`"Nnngggyyyyhhhh... `
`Th-This is a present from the Ushiromiya Family Head to Maria... `
`It is a...cute...nnnggg, *cough*cough*. `
`An item worthy of the Ushiromiya family's dignity and grace. `
`T-Take good care of it..." `
`"Thank you, Grandfather!! `
`I love you!! `
`*kiss*kiss*!" `
`"N-Nngggwoooooooohhhhh...!! `
`Ooohhh, Mariaaaaaaa, my adorable granddaughter!! `
`*kiss*kiss*!!!" `
`"............" `
`By this point, even Genji had to give up on Kinzo's dignity. `
`Still, the dignity of the Family Head had lasted a full ten seconds longer than usual this year. `
`"Happy Halloween, Grandfather. `
`This is from me." `
`"Happy Halloween. This one's mine. `
`I hope you like it." `
`"Oooooh, George, Jessica, `
`I must thank you once again this year. `
`I'm...so happy..." `
`With tears streaming down his face, Kinzo hugged George and Jessica. `
`"Oh, and Battler too. `
`...I'm so glad you've returned to the family. `
`...It's been lonely without you, these six years..." `
`"...Well, ...um, anyway, `
`...Happy Halloween. `
`Not sure if you'll like it though..." `
`"Don't worry, ...don't worry, Battler... `
`I know you have things you want to say, things you want to ask. `
`...But now is not the time." `
`"Grandfather..." `
`"I am...glad that you have returned to the Ushiromiya family... `
`...It makes me feel...happy..." `
`Slowly, ...Kinzo moved forward and hugged Battler. `
`Battler drew back at first, but then he understood Kinzo's feelings and hugged him back. `
`Ange watched this scene play out, ...shocked. `
`Was Ushiromiya Kinzo...always this kind of person...? `
`"Ange, `
`you're up." `
`"Go on, give it to Grandfather." `
`"...Ah, ...okay." `
`Ange...didn't have a clue what was going on. `
`She took the present her mother had given her...and walked forward timidly. `
`...Kinzo's face, which had looked so cheery a second ago, `
`suddenly became stern as soon as Ange stepped forward. `
`No, it didn't 'become' stern. `
`That expression...was the one always worn by the Kinzo inside Ange's mind. `
`This was Ushiromiya Kinzo. `
`He was fickle, short-tempered, and always wore a stern expression on his face. `
`...This was the most terrifying person in the Ushiromiya family... `
`"............" `
`"............" `
`It felt as though the world went suddenly quiet, and it only did it when I stepped forward. `
`...Why? `
`Why only for me? `
`But, ...isn't this how it should be? `
`Isn't this the Ushiromiya Kinzo I expect? ...The Ushiromiya Kinzo I understand...? `
`I was like a puppet carrying a tea tray. `
`I walked forward, bewildered, with the present held out in front of me, ...and stopped in front of Kinzo. `
`Without letting his expression change in the slightest, `
`Kinzo slowly reached out and touched the present... `
`"AAAAAaaaaannnggeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!" `
`In an instant, Ange was caught in a firm embrace, present and all. `
`Kinzo's white beard rubbed against her cheek. `
`"Grandpa...Grandpa is so happyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!! `
`I'm so glad to be blessed with such lovely grandchildren!! `
`I feel happyyyyyyy!! `
`So happy the tears just won't...just won't stoooooooooooop!!" `
`"...Master, your nose is running. `
`...That...and your dignity." `
`"Oh, Genji, forgive me!! `
`I...alwa{0}n{0}t{0}h{0}f{0}n{0}h{0}h{0}h{0}hnnn... `
`*sniffle*!!" `
`he didn't look like he could possibly be anyone other than a kindly grandpa overcome with tears at his grandchildren's gifts. `
`"Thank you, Ange. `
`I heard that you chose to come even though you weren't feeling well at all... `
`I'm so glad...! `
`Here, this is for you." `
`He pressed a large gift box to Ange's chest. `
`...She finally realized that all of Kinzo's presents were wrapped differently and in boxes of different sizes. `
`"I wonder what he got you, Ange. `
`I hear that Grandfather always personally chooses what he'll give each one of us. `
`Pretty incredible, with all these people." `
`"......He picks them himself. `
`...Every year. `
`........." `
`He does... `
`what every year? `
`He picks... `
`what himself? `
`This bizarre ceremony happens...every year. `
`The cousins were all happily chattering about what their Halloween presents would be this year. `
`Maria came up to Ange and suggested that they compare the weights of their presents, `
`but for some reason, Ange just stared blankly. `
`After that, the adults also handed their presents to Kinzo one by one, `
`receiving a gift in return, along with considerate words about their health and questions about how they'd been doing recently. `
`Then, after watching to see that all exchanges had been completed, Gohda appeared... `
`and announced that lunch was ready. `
`"Ah, is it ready...?! `
`Come, ladies and gentlemen! `
`Let us enjoy the splendid lunch that Gohda has prepared for us. `
`Quickly, to the dining hall!" `
`"This way, everyone. `
`Follow me." `
`"We will carry your presents to your rooms in the guesthouse." `
`"Please, feel free to leave them here as you leave for lunch." `
`The relatives stood up, leaving their presents where they lay on tables and sofas, and followed Kinzo out of the parlor. `
`...Only Ange remained standing there, stunned, `
`...as she clutched the present Kinzo had given her... `
`Gohda's lunches had never betrayed expectations before. `
`When Hideyoshi said that these meals were the only reason anyone ever came to these family conferences, everyone laughed and nodded. `
`The delicious food caused conversations to erupt all over the room. `
`You've gotten so big. `
`How have you been lately? `
`Pretty good. `
`It was a fun meal, with everyone asking each other about the latest and laughing together. `
`The Ushiromiya family sat at meals in a specific ranked seating order, `
`so the adult siblings, the cousins, and the spouses all sat in groups. `
`So, conversations sprung up naturally. `
`Ange had withdrawn slightly from the cousins' chat and was looking around the dining hall. `
`...What are Kinzo and the adult siblings doing? `
`Their conversation seemed to be peaceful and fun. `
`Most of the time, the siblings were mothers or fathers of their own households. `
`However, when they gathered together by themselves in front of Kinzo, that burden was lifted from their shoulders, `
`and they became young and bright as though they'd gone back to being kids again. `
`Rudolf, who was usually an easygoing father who nonetheless had a sense of dignity, `
`became so bright and cheery in this group that it almost looked like there was another Battler. `
`Even Kinzo looked peaceful and relaxed. `
`He didn't say a word about money or the inheritance. `
`In fact, he didn't even insult his children or call them incompetent. `
`He just looked like a happy old man, genuinely pleased to have his whole family together for the only time this year. `
`The group of spouses was just as harmonious. `
`The mothers kept bringing up problems with education and household matters, as well as family health issues. `
`Hideyoshi and Nanjo happily joined in on their conversation. `
`And what about the cousins? `
`...There was no way such an enjoyable meal with such a fun group of friends could fail to be raucous. `
`Maria was in her element, showing off her knowledge of Halloween trivia. `
`George and Jessica would nod in understanding, Battler would say something stupid, and Maria would laugh at him. `
`If I wanted, I could easily join in on that conversation, `
`and if the dessert caught my attention, I could easily slip out of the conversation too. `
`It was...happiness, both fun and natural. `
`...It felt like waking up from a daydream to be greeted by the rays of the springtime sun. `
`"According to the weather report, we can expect a big storm sometime tonight." `
`"It's supposed to be a typhoon. `
`Looks like we'll be stuck here for more than one night again." `
`"I do not mind in the least. `
`You may stay here as long as you wish. If it would mean seeing my adorable grandchildren's faces more, I would pray for rain every day." `
`"Give us a break. We do have work to get back to." `
`"Why don't you leave the island, Father? `
`That way, you could see your grandchildren whenever you wanted." `
`"Hahhahaha, true. `
`Living on a remote island may have a sense of majesty, but haven't you had your fill of it?" `
`"...It's too noisy in the city. `
`I much prefer a quiet island, with no one on it but my family. `
`I like it here." `
`"But on Rokkenjima, if something happens, it would take some time for a doctor to arrive." `
`"I agree. `
`At your age, I think you should at least consider moving to Niijima." `
`"...I am old now. `
`I want to live in peace, surrounded only by my family. `
`...And I am satisfied. `
`I have this island to make that dream of mine come true." `
`"Father..." `
`"Hmm... `
`It seems I've gotten you all down. `
`Ladies and gentlemen, this ends Gohda's lunch. `
`Grandchildren, it will probably be raining constantly starting tomorrow. `
`Now is your last chance to see clear skies. `
`Why not enjoy the flowers and then take a walk on the beach?" `
`"That sounds good. `
`Okay, everyone. `
`Let's go." `
`"Uu-! `
`I wanna see the flowers and walk on the beach! `
`We can collect shells, and collect glass too!" `
`"Collect glass? `
`That, uh, sounds a bit dangerous...!" `
`"Fragments of glass get washed by the waves and become round, beautiful gems, which drift to shore. `
`Did you forget, Battler? `
`Remember how we used to pick them up together?" `
`"Oh... Were those glass fragments? `
`I always thought they were just pretty stones." `
`"Have you ever seen a glass gem, Ange?!" `
`"...No." `
`"Then let's go!! `
`I'll show you!! `
`Let's go, let's go! `
`But the first to see them gets to keep them! `
`I'm gonna get them all!" `
`"Heheh, in that case, I'm not gonna lose either. `
`Let's see who can find the prettiest, biggest glass gem!" `
`"All right! `
`At times like this, why not be a kid?! `
`I'm not gonna lose either!" `
`"Then we'll head down to the beach." `
`"Indeed. `
`Take it easy and enjoy your time together, grandchildren." `
`The cousins rose from their seats and noisily left the dining hall. `
`Maria grabbed Ange's hand and dragged her along. `
`However, Ange's expression was vague and absentminded, the opposite of Maria's full smile... `
