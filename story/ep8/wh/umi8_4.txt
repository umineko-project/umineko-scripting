`Outside, the rain had started to pour down hard. `
`However, inside the cousin room, it was loud and cheery. `
`It could have been raining spears, and no one would have paid any attention. `
`"Ihihiii!! `
`Full house!! `
`Take that!" `
`"Whoa. `
`You weren't bluffing...!" `
`The cousins were all bursting with energy, sitting in a circle on the bed. `
`"And I thought Battler always had crap in his hands every time he acted tough...!" `
`"Of course, I've been losing all this time just to make you think that! `
`Ushiromiya Battler, the man who loses strategically to win in the end! Ihihi!" `
`"Uu-, Battler's incredible...! `
`All my coins have disappeared again." `
`"I'll give you some of mine. `
`Let's crush Battler together, okay?!" `
`With just a deck of cards, the cousins could enjoy themselves for hours and hours. `
`They were so engrossed that the occasional thunderbolt hardly even registered as static in the background. `
`"I'm starting to get hungry. `
`I wonder if dinner's ready yet." `
`"Who knows. `
`It should be ready soon. `
`Gohda-san and the others really went all out for tonight." `
`"Heheh, which means we've got a lot to look forward to. `
`Is this to celebrate my long-awaited return?" `
`"I heard from Shannon just now that it's going to be a Halloween party. `
`They'll set up a buffet in the hall. `
`Sounds incredible." `
`"A Halloween party?! `
`Incredible, incredible, uu-uu-uu-!!" `
`"Hmm? `
`Yeah, who is it?" `
`There was a knock, the door opened, and Ange was there. `
`She had been sleeping in her parents' room. `
`"Hey, Ange! `
`So, you woke up." `
`"Umm, they said it's time for dinner, so we have to go to the mansion. `
`They said to get ready." `
`"Uu-uu-uu-!! `
`Food, fooood!! `
`I'm hungry!!" `
`Perhaps because she was the hungriest, Maria celebrated more vigorously than anyone else. `
`She jumped up happily and hopped off the bed. `
`As the others all clambered off the bed and started putting their shoes on, Kyrie and Rudolf came into view. `
`"Hey, brats. `
`Time for food, so get ready." `
`"It looks like today will be extra special. `
`I can't wait to see it." `
`"Uu-!! I know! `
`It's a Halloween party!" `
`"...A Halloween party?" `
`"KIhhihihihihi! `
`I know, and Ange doesn't. `
`Kihhihihihi." `
`"Mom, what's a Halloween party?" `
`"Who knows? `
`We'll have to go and see for ourselves." `
`"Everyone ready? `
`It's about time to go." `
`"Is everyone here? `
`Please follow me." `
`"Maria, over here. `
`Your collar's crooked." `
`"Ah, I'm starving. `
`The food is the best part of these family conferences. `
`Are you starving too, Ange-chan?" `
`Eva smiled at Ange. `
`"...Yeah. `
`I'm starving." `
`"Ange. `
`That's "I'm hungry", right?" `
`"*giggle* Don't worry about it. `
`Yeah, I'll bet you're starving. `
`My stomach's rumbling too." `
`"Okay, let's get out of here. `
`Looks like the wind's blowing hard outside. `
`Make sure you don't lose your umbrellas." `
`"Everyone, please take an umbrella." `
`"Here's your umbrella, Ange-chan." `
`"Thanks, Aunt Eva." `
`"*giggle* `
`...Ah, girls really are so cute. `
`Come over to play at your aunt's house one of these days. `
`It's a promise, okay?" `
`"...It looks like Aunt Eva's taken a liking to Ange." `
`"Yep. `
`Apparently, Mother really wanted a daughter." `
`"Ah, I've heard that too. `
`I think she adored me too, when I was little." `
`"My Mama said she really wanted a son, uu-!" `
`"If your kid grows up happily, it doesn't matter if they're a boy or a girl. `
`Maria is my precious, precious gift from God." `
`When they got outside, the wind was fairly strong. `
`Eva, who had really hit it off with Ange, offered to share an umbrella with the little girl. `
`It was hard to tell what they were chatting so excitedly about, but they seemed to be getting along splendidly already. `
`Battler opened his umbrella as he watched this. `
`His little sister was cute when she clung to him, but she was just as cute and adorable when looking up at someone else with a happy smile. `
`The wind and rain were strong, but even this must have been the perfect spice to heighten their anticipation of the coming meal... `
`Thanks to some festive decorations, the main hall had been remade into the scene of a Halloween party. `
`The Ushiromiya family always took meals in the dining hall. `
`This was the first time I'd ever seen a buffet-style party set up in the main hall. `
`"Yo, Battleeer! `
`Hey, Maria! Long time no see...!" `
`"Beato!! `
`Happy Halloween! `
`Trick-or-treat...!!" `
`"*cackle*cackle* `
`I have some candy for you, but now is not the time. `
`After all, it's just before a meal." `
`"*giggle* `
`Thank you, {f:5:Beatrice}-san. `
`I see you're looking as beautiful as ever." `
`"You too, Rosa! `
`You certainly don't look old enough to be a mother. `
`Wahaha!" `
`"Have you been drinking? `
`Your ears are looking pretty red there." `
`"Hmm? `
`Well, after you left, uhihi-! `
`Kinzo said he'd bought this rare drink, so I couldn't help but sample a bit...! `
`Wahahahahaha!" `
`"And this coming from a person who tells little kids not to eat candy before a meal..." `
`"Pardon me. `
`{f:5:Beatrice}-sama, the Master is calling for you." `
`I saw Kinzo beckoning from over by the portrait. `
`"Good grief. `
`When it comes to ceremonies, that man is always so obsessed with form." `
`"It's probably about that ceremony for the gold's return. `
`This is a huge turning point for the Ushiromiya family. `
`You'd better go and play along." `
`"It does make one feel a bit lonely though." `
`"This won't change the fact that you're the Ushiromiya family alchemist." `
`"Perhaps. `
`Then I'll be back shortly. `
`See you later, okay? `
`According to Genji, today's party has a bit of a theme to it. `
`You'd better look forward to it...!" `
`"You make it sound like you did any of the work." `
`"Wahhahahaha, you're another one who obsesses too much over details...! `
`Later!" `
`"...Onii-chan, is something going to happen today? `
`Is it a special day...?" `
`It looked as though even Ange had picked up on that much. `
`She seemed to be getting tense for no reason. `
`"This is a special day for the Ushiromiya family. `
`But it doesn't have anything to do with you personally, so you should just relax." `
`"Okay. `
`...Ah, that's right. Hey, hey, did you know? `
`I just heard a huge secret from Aunt Eva...! `
`Even Maria onee-chan doesn't know, but I'll tell you!" `
`"Ooh? `
`So, what's this secret?" `
`"Okay, okay! `
`I heard that if you get an almond in yours, you win...!" `
`"Win? `
`Is this like a lottery or something?" `
`"Hmmmmmmmmmm... `
`Anyway, if you get an almond, you win!" `
`Ange puffed out her cheeks. `
`Apparently, she wanted to be praised for sharing this exciting secret. `
`But just knowing that almonds win doesn't really explain much. `
`"Okay, got it. `
`Thanks for letting me in on that major secret." `
`"Nnnnnnng, you're mean, Onii-chan! `
`And I even told you my secret!" `
`Ange, her cheeks still puffed out, headed back to where Aunt Eva was. `
`They really are getting along well. `
`Well, I guess I have no problem if it's her aunt. `
`If it was some guy from her class, I don't care if they're in elementary school, it's not happening! `
`No playing with the opposite sex without Onii-chan's approval! `
`At that moment, Genji-san's voice rang out. `
`The chatter gradually subsided, and the rain outside once again became apparent. `
`"Ladies and gentlemen, I ask for your silence." `
`Silence filled the room. `
`All of the relatives seemed vaguely aware that tonight's festivities consisted of more than a Halloween party. `
`Battler already knew. `
`This was a ceremony to mark the return of the gold, from Kinzo to {f:5:Beatrice}, which had been borrowed for so many years. `
`Now, that fact was being announced by Kinzo himself. `
`He spoke of how this gold had not only restored the Ushiromiya family, but brought it to a level of wealth it had never before experienced. `
`He spoke of how he would finally return this gold to {f:5:Beatrice}, the one who had saved the Ushiromiya family. `
`Kinzo personally handed an ingot, decorated with a bright red ribbon, to {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`"......This is the debt we owe to three generations of {f:5:Beatrice}, the Golden Witch. `
`The Ushiromiya family will never forget it." `
`"Sheesh. `
`If you've nowhere to put it, I'll be happy to take it off your hands." `
`"...{f:5:Beatrice}-sama." `
`"N-Nnng, *cough*cough*." `
`It was hard to imagine Beato, of all people, getting admonished by Genji. `
`I couldn't help but laugh. `
`"I am {f:5:Beatrice}, the Ushiromiya family alchemist. `
`Tonight, I acknowledge the end of the loan contract for the 10 tons of gold. `
`...Now, several decades following my grandmother's generation, `
`the time has come for the eagle that lost one wing to fly once more. `
`I will watch over that eagle, and I pray for its prosperity in all generations to come." `
`Applause filled the hall. `
`Though she'd managed to make such a dignified speech for once, as soon as it was over, she stuck her tongue out and leered at us. `
`I guess that's about the limit to how long Beato can stay serious. `
`"By passing her name on through the generations, {f:5:Beatrice}, the Golden Witch, may live for thousands of years. `
`Therefore, even her descendants shall be {f:5:Beatrice}, and all shall be alchemists to this family. `
`The descendants of the Ushiromiya family will praise {f:5:Beatrice} for her gratitude forevermore, and this will be passed on through the generations. `
`...This family will always be indebted to {f:5:Beatrice}, and she will always be our family, tied by a noble bond." `
`"...Let those who acknowledge this show their recognition with their applause." `
`After Genji's words, the relatives all looked at each other, then started applauding at once. `
`"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. `
`...{f:5:Beatrice}, `
`you are a member of the Ushiromiya family. `
`And that is a bond more sacred than one of blood." `
`"Wahaha, of course lending money is more important than being a blood relation." `
`"...{f:5:Beatrice}-sama." `
`"Nngyhh, nnn...!" `
`After that, Kinzo's longwinded speech continued. `
`Tonight, Kinzo would retire as the Ushiromiya Family Head. `
`Then, he announced that he would reveal the distribution of his inheritance. `
`A stir of excitement spread across the siblings in money trouble when they heard that they wouldn't have to wait for Kinzo's death to get their shares. `
`"I am aware that each of you is in trouble with money. `
`This should be enough to resolve all of those problems. `
`...But do not grow complacent. `
`This is my inheritance, given to you before my death. `
`In the past, though I have been strict, I have always watched over you." `
`"However, beginning tonight, your father will cease to provide support of that kind. `
`...I shall watch on as you take flight, as though watching down upon you from the heavens. `
`No longer will I interfere. `
`...You may live however you please." `
`"...D-Dad..." `
`"Father..." `
`"We understand... `
`...We will certainly...take flight on our own." `
`"Here and now, all of us siblings swear to work together... `
`to make the Ushiromiya family even more prosperous." `
`"That's right...! `
`If we stick together, nothin' can stand in our way...!" `
`Hideyoshi laughed, but Genji admonished him. `
`However, he could understand why they were so happy. `
`...So far, the siblings had quarreled ruthlessly over the inheritance. `
`However, this evening, `
`...the inheritance had been neatly split apart, and they no longer had any need to scheme for money. `
`In other words, the siblings no longer had any reason to squabble with each other anymore. `
`On the contrary, this was a time for them to join hands and help each other become more and more prosperous. `
`Eva and Rosa were sniffling, with tears in their eyes. `
`...And so was Rudolf. `
`Perhaps now, ...despite their ages, `
`...they had finally left the nest for real. `
`Tonight, the eagles of the Ushiromiya family would leave Rokkenjima, the nest weaved from the witch's magic, and go their separate ways. `
`With their own power and determination. `
`It made Kinzo think. `
`If only I had done this from the start... `
`...If he had settled the inheritance problem himself, there would have been no need for his children to quarrel at all. `
`Instead, he had acted in a sullen manner and left the problem to them, which had resulted in their strained relationships. `
`Yes. `
`It was all his responsibility. `
`And now, the intertwining bonds had been released. `
`It was as though an invisible rope had been wrapped around Kinzo's body. `
`That rope was now gone, and he felt a sense of release he hadn't experienced for many years... `
`The four siblings stepped forward, and before Kinzo, they swore to all support Krauss, the new Head, and lead the family to greater prosperity. `
`Their faces sparkled with an unexpected youthfulness. `
`It was only natural. `
`After all, none of the four had made such a natural-feeling promise since the time they were kids. `
`As the vibrancy of their youth returned to them, the siblings made a promise once again. `
`When Krauss finished his announcement, a friendly applause filled the hall. `
`The cousins... `
`and the servants too... `
`...joined in on the applause that continued on and on. `
`Ange...watched this, dumbfounded. `
`...The four siblings were supposed to have quarreled with each other constantly since they were kids. `
`And they were supposed to have pointlessly locked swords with Kinzo's inheritance as their goal, their worries over money spurring them on. `
`...Thanks to this ceremony, even the world of "truth", the world I acknowledge, ...has been rewritten. `
`Were they actually friendly towards each other, or did they quarrel all the time like I believe? It doesn't matter. `
`...Either way, right here, right now, all of those problems have been resolved. `
`I mustn't believe. `
`...This is just...Onii-chan's farce. `
`Even though I knew that fact, `
`...when I watched Dad and the others hugging each other, with teary smiles on their faces, ...I couldn't help but feel something warm welling up in my eyes. `
`"I won't believe... `
`...This is all...Onii-chan's farce..." `
`"What will you have to see...what will you have to hear... `
`before you'll let yourself believe...?" `
`"...Red. `
`......If you say it with the red truth..." `
`"Is everything that can't be said in red a lie?" `
`"...I won't believe... `
`...This is...just..." `
`Ange looked at the floor and fell silent. `
`As the Game Master, Battler was able to use the red truth. `
`However, that rule only exists on a witch's game board. `
`In the world of Humans, red truth...doesn't exist. `
`People see things, hear things, `
`...and when they believe that something is worth believing, they accept it as a red truth. `
`Unless Ange accepts it, no kind of truth can become truth. `
`Battler wanted her to realize this. `
`There was no point in using the red truth, a rule of this game, to force the truth on her. `
`Ange would have to use her own power, her own heart... `
`To accept the truth as truth. `
`The decision was Ange's. `
`No one could force her to decide either way. `
`So, there was nothing wrong with Ange declaring this scene to be a farce. `
`But if so, ...then what about the hot tears dripping down Ange's face? `
`...Ange would have to think that through herself, without anyone telling her... `
`After one sniffle and a rub of her eyes, Ange let the six-year-old version of herself take control of her piece. `
`What followed was a harmonious, fun stretch of time. `
`Beautifully adorned dishes were brought in one after another, and champagne corks were loosened with pleasant sounds. `
`Several small tables were set here and there, each with its own theme. `
`That was where the fun lay in this stand-up buffet party, as the guests wandered from table to table, pondering what they should eat first. `
`This sort of performance was where Gohda's genius shone through. `
`The hotel that let him go should've regretted ever having done so. `
`Of course, a stand-up buffet would probably be a tiring affair for the middle-aged. `
`So, chairs had been set up as well. `
`However, each time a new dish was brought into the hall, they could get up to look, wandering through the tables however they pleased. `
`This way, they could each bump into a new group of people, then mingle elsewhere when that group melted apart. `
`People are interesting. `
`As the members in each group changed, so did the topic of conversation. `
`The bustling Halloween party played out like a colorful kaleidoscope. `
`The origami chains decorating the walls brought back youthful memories. `
`Those would help anyone enjoy themselves like they were kids again... `
`Even to Ange, it was like a dream. `
`She chatted happily with her cousins. `
`She also chatted with her aunts and uncles. `
`Beato showed her several tricks that she called magic. `
`Maria said they were magic, Ange said they were tricks, and the night grew even more lively. `
`The two young girls were so fired up that the adults decided to show some tricks they knew, shocking both of the kids utterly. `
`Eventually, they each started showing tricks to the others, asking if they'd ever seen this one or that one before, `
`and it became a party of magic, just perfect for Halloween. `
`In addition to magic tricks, several quizzes, riddles and games popped up, reminding everyone of their childhood days. `
`Even the servants who were serving food got dragged into the groups, and the whole hall was filled with chatter. `
`To Ange, young as she was, every single magic trick, quiz, and riddle was an entirely new experience. `
`They stimulated her intellectual curiosity, and she couldn't contain her excitement. `
`Add in the wide variety of delicious foods and drinks she could choose from, and it was like being in a dream. `
`Ange felt a floaty sensation, as though she was walking on a cloud... `
`"Ange, ...did you drink some of this?! `
`This is Daddy's drink!" `
`"...I wanted to try some adult grape juice too. `
`So it's okay." `
`"Your face is looking a little red there. `
`Are you feeling all right?" `
`"She only had a bit, so I think she'll be fine..." `
`"...I'll be fine. `
`I'm not a kid... `
`...*hic*..." `
`"*giggle* `
`Ange-chan, drink this one, okay? `
`That stuff your dad drinks is nasty, so don't try any more, got it?" `
`"That's right! `
`If you drink bad stuff, you'll end up as a bad adult too. Ihihi!" `
`"I'm not gonna be a bad adult! `
`I'm gonna be a princess!" `
`"That's right. `
`Ange is our princess." `
`"Yep. `
`She's our family's princess." `
`"I agree. `
`You'd better come over to my house to play sometime...! `
`We'll have lots of fun!" `
`"Okay. `
`Thanks, Aunt Eva...!" `
`Everyone's being really nice. `
`It almost feels like I've become a real princess. `
`I feel so great, I could almost believe that this whole celebration was being held for my sake. `
`Battler stood outside that group of people. `
`As he watched Ange smiling happily from the distance, he smiled too. `
`"...When she smiles like that, she really lives up to her name. `
`It's so sad." `
`"I agree. `
`It really is a smile fit for an angel." `
`"I hope that smile comes from the real Ange...and not just the piece." `
`"...Even if it doesn't, she's watching this. `
`And she can think it through herself." `
`"This game between you and Ange really is overflowing with affection. `
`So much that it's irritatingly slow for me." `
`"And what's wrong with that? `
`There's no one to get in her way. `
`No obstacles or tactics or anything else to worry about." `
`"That's right. `
`This game...is no longer a battle." `
`"Now that you mention it, this is cleaning up. `
`...Cleaning up after our game." `
`"......I'll never be able to make up for the sin I did to her...through my careless actions." `
`"We have to take responsibility for our game. `
`We'll make up for our sins together. `
`...That's why we're showing Ange this final game." `
`"Do you think...that Ange will be able to use that key the right way...?" `
`"...Of course, I've thought about forcibly dragging her in the direction we think is right." `
`"Such an attempt would probably have been meaningless. `
`...When you're forced to make a decision, it's hard to accept that it was truly a correct one, no matter how much time passes." `
`"Exactly. `
`...Ange has to think and choose for herself. `
`Even if she doesn't make the decision we view as the correct one, ...I think we should respect it." `
`"...Hmmm. `
`...You are the Game Master. `
`I cannot argue with you anymore. `
`I will simply watch on and enjoy this night." `
`"This game is really significant for Ange. `
`But for us, it's kind of like a party after the show." `
`"It's almost time. `
`But, are you sure? `
`Ange might get the wrong idea again, right?" `
`"It'll be fine. `
`In fact, this is necessary. `
`...Just like how you appeared in the way you did. `
`And everyone else too." `
`"......Hmmm. `
`Then let us enjoy this final celebration with the others. `
`After all, all of them have acted their parts so well in this long game." `
`That instant, the sound of someone clapping for attention rang out. `
`"Your attention, everyone. `
`Please gather...And now, for today's special event...!" `
`Gohda had been the one clapping. `
`Everyone gathered together, wondering what was going on. `
`On the serving cart in front of him was a large, sliced, chocolate cake. `
`"As the highlight of tonight's Halloween party, I have prepared this Sachertorte for you all. `
`As you can see, it was made specially for the Ushiromiya family, and bears the crest of the One-Winged Eagle in chocolate!" `
`The stupendous cake drew a gasp of admiration from all present. `
`"What a splendid cake...! `
`A perfect highlight for the party." `
`"Oh, no. `
`It's not just the cake. `
`Tonight's cake has a little secret. `
`...Master, I ask that you explain that secret to everyone!" `
`"Very well. `
`This is a bit of a game. `
`One slice of this cake will be used to select the winner." `
`"It's got an almond in it...!" `
`Ange shouted happily. `
`Kinzo looked at her and nodded. `
`"In just one slice of this cake, there is a single almond. `
`The one who chooses that piece shall become tonight's king." `
`"Whoo! `
`It's been a long time since I played the king game...!" `
`"I'm guessing the subject matter was a bit different when you played it..." `
`"Hahhahahahahahaha. `
`So, what happens to the person who becomes the king?" `
`"The king gets to name one wish. `
`Then, we shall all try to grant it together." `
`"Oooh! `
`Sounds interesting...!" `
`"Uu-. `
`Kings are boys. `
`Girls can't be kings." `
`"If a girl wins, they get to become the princess." `
`"The almond! `
`The one with the almond wins! `
`Right? Right?!" `
`"Ahahahaha, that's right. `
`You're incredible, Ange." `
`"In times like this, luck can tell you somethin' about a man. `
`Can't let myself lose now!" `
`"Hold up there. `
`Let's let the smallest kids choose first." `
`"Good idea. `
`Ange-chan, you can go first." `
`"Hey, you're the big cousin now, Maria! `
`Let Ange-chan go first." `
`"Uu-uu-uu-! `
`But what if Ange wins, uu-!" `
`"I am gonna win! `
`The almond wins, the almond wins!" `
`"It seems we old fogies must hope that leftovers are lucky today." `
`"If we're going by age, I guess that means Kinzo's last." `
`"Wahhahahahaha, but weren't you a thousand years old?" `
`"N-Nooooooooo!!" `
`Everyone burst out laughing. `
`Her real age was unknown, but she claimed to be 19 years old. `
`In front of Ange lay a large cake, split into several pieces. `
`Just one of those pieces was the winner. `
`"Well then, Ange-sama, `
`which piece would you like? `
`Whichever you choose, it will be ever so delicious." `
`"No way. `
`I only want the winning one." `
`"Well then, you'll have to try and guess right on the first shot. `
`Go ahead, pick one." `
`Battler pushed Ange's small back towards the table with the cake. `
`"......Which one...should I take...?" `
`The chocolate cake was cut into 15 pieces. `
`...I wanna pick the one with the almond and become the princess! `
`One of them has an almond. Which could it be...? `
`I get to choose first, ...but it sort of feels unfair. `
`I mean, it is, isn't it? `
`My chances of getting the right one are one in 15. `
`There's no way I'll get it. `
`And then, when Maria onee-chan goes after me, she has a one in 14 chance of picking the winner. `
`The next person has a one in 13 chance, then a one in 12 chance, ...and the last person...will win for sure?? `
`"Onii-chan, this isn't fair...! `
`It's harder for the person who goes first...!" `
`Everyone laughed. `
`Apparently, there was something wrong with my calculations, but I still didn't like it. `
`"Then let us start this contest of luck with Ange-sama. `
`Please, feel free to make your selection...!" `
`"...Okay! `
`Okay...!!" `
`If I have to pick one out of so many, there's no way I'll win. `
`...But for some reason, tonight, it feels like I might actually win after all. `
`I have no reason for feeling this way, but when I'm in a good mood, Lady Luck always brings me fortune. `
`"Have you decided yet?" `
`"Yeah. `
`......I've decided. `
`This one's...the winner." `
`I concentrated on my fingertip...and pointed at one of the 15 slices. `
`The slice I chose was... `
`"...This one!" `
`"This one? Are you sure?" `
`"I've made up my mind. `
`I want this one...!" `
`When he asked me whether I was sure, I felt a little uneasy. `
`Still, at times like this, it's better to stick with your instincts. `
`It was one of the few bits of philosophy that this young girl had learned from her few life experiences. `
`Gohda took the chosen slice, put it on a plate with a fork, and handed it to Ange. `
`"I go next!! `
`Uu-uu-, which should I take?!" `
`It was Maria's turn next. `
`She was excited, determined to be the winner. `
`I walked away from that group, all by myself. `
`...I was struck by a temptation to quickly cut the cake open and check for an almond inside. `
`However, I stopped myself. `
`If I check my piece first, my chance of winning is one in 15. `
`However, if I wait for some other people to check their slices, then when I see that they've lost, my chances will go up, if only slightly. `
`In other words, instead of searching for the almond right away, `
`my chances will go up if I wait for some other people to lose. `
`But if someone picks a winner while I'm sitting around here, the chances of my slice being a winner will go to zero. `
`It'll be tough to calculate the right moment. `
`I need to wait just long enough for as many losers to show up as possible. `
`My chances of winning are highest if I can check my piece immediately before someone else wins. `
`Yeah, that's the trick to winning this game! `
`...... `
`......??? `
`What a strange thought. `
`...It feels like I'm missing something?? `
`Even though no one else can touch the cake that's sitting in front of me... `
`The almond inside it will appear or disappear depending on whether or not the other people win or lose. `
`......?? `
`I was in such a good mood that I felt dizzy, and I couldn't figure out what was wrong with my theory. `
`But I did realize that something was strange. `
`...There is always just one truth inside a cat box. `
`No matter what happens outside the box, ...it shouldn't be able to shake the truth inside. `
`And yet, ...I'm being shaken about by events outside the cat box, trying to use those to change the way I observe the box's contents. `
`............ `
`I don't even know what I'm saying. `
`Another me inside me is trying to say that, ...but it's too hard for me to understand. `
`I feel like I'm drifting... `
`I got so cheery and excited that, even though I'm not sleepy, my mind feels hazy. `
`Maybe it's 'cause I drank Dad's adult drink... `
`In the end, even though I chose the first piece, I decided to check it last. `
`After I've seen that everyone else has lost, my chances of winning will be 100%. `
`...I tried to find the contradiction in my thinking, but I didn't really get it, so I stopped. `
`It's much better to have a 100% chance than a one in 15 one, so I decided to bet on that. `
`I couldn't wait to open this precious treasure chest, `
`but I waited for everyone else to choose their pieces and check them. `
`"How is it going? `
`Has anyone found a winner?" `
`"Uu-! `
`Mine didn't have one." `
`"I lost too. `
`Guess I'll have to give up on being the princess...!" `
`"Even if you lose, this Sachertorte really is beautiful and delicious. `
`It's such a good decoration, it's almost a shame to eat it." `
`"How about you? `
`Got the almond?" `
`"No, not me either. `
`What about you, Hideyoshi nii-san?" `
`"Mine's a loser too. `
`Looks like I've used up all my luck with my company and my wife." `
`"What exactly do you mean by that?" `
`"What about you, Doctor Nanjo?" `
`"I'm checking it now. `
`Games like this can truly can be fun, every now and then." `
`"Indeed. `
`Sometimes, a simple test of luck, without any strategy or tactics, can be quite entertaining. `
`What about you, Beato?" `
`"Where's the liar who said leftovers would be lucky?! `
`Grrrrrrrr...!" `
`"What about you, Ange? `
`Was there an almond in yours?" `
`"I'm checking now..." `
`"Oh, you still haven't touched yours?" `
`I had been following my own personal probability theory, `
`but I didn't think I could explain it well to Onii-chan, so I didn't mention it to him. `
`I wonder if there's an almond in here. `
`If I win, I'll be tonight's princess. `
`...I'll be happy if I win, but even if I don't, it'll still be a really fun night, so that's okay. `
`It got put on hold when this cake game started, but before then, everyone was having a lot of fun trading tricks, quizzes, and riddles. `
`This game is fun too, but I want to play like that again soon. `
`......Huh? `
`"What's up, Ange? `
`......Oh?" `
`I lifted up that tiny thing with my fork and stared at it, then showed it to my brother. `
`"This...is an almond, right...?" `
`"Wh-Whoa!! `
`Ange got it! `
`That's awesome...!" `
`At the same time, a stir rose up in the other corner of the room. `
`"I got one, I won...!" `
`"Hoh! `
`So Eva won...!" `
`"My, my! `
`Congratulations, Eva-sama...!!" `
`"That's wrong!! `
`I won! `
`Mine has the almond!!" `
`I held the almond high and shouted across the room. `
`The crowd around Eva split, and everyone stared at me, surprised. `
`I was surprised too. `
`The thing in her hand was, without a doubt, an almond... `
`"What the heck...? `
`What's going on here...?" `
`"Gohda. `
`There seem to be two almonds, ...so are they both winners?" `
`"But...that shouldn't have..." `
`"Does this mean that one of the two winners made a mistake...?" `
`"Ange-sama's is clearly an almond. `
`...How about your end, Kanon-kun?" `
`"Eva-sama's is clearly an almond." `
`"Hohhohohohohoho. `
`Then it seems that they both win." `
`"......Master." `
`"Heheheheheheh...! `
`What an odd occurrence. `
`What's all this, Gohda?" `
`"Ah, umm, ...well, ...it seems we've had a little mistake... `
`Uh, ...perhaps they should do rock, paper..." `
`"Come now, don't be stingy. `
`It just means that two almonds have appeared to signify the queen and the princess." `
`"Precisely. `
`Let's have them both be winners." `
`"Ah, well, but..." `
`Gohda was hesitant. `
`Actually, he had prepared a single special dessert for the king. `
`It had been decorated in a way that made it hard to split for two people. `
`So, it wasn't convenient for there to be two kings. `
`When Eva heard Gohda mumbling something to this effect, she shrugged and laughed. `
`"In that case, let's have Ange-chan be the princess." `
`"The princess? `
`I'm the princess...?!" `
`"I'll be your attendant. `
`That works, right?" `
`Of course it worked. `
`Ange had been worried that Eva would be declared the winner, since she had spoken up first. `
`So, she hadn't even dreamed that Eva would give it up to her. `
`"But, are you sure...? `
`You won too." `
`"It's okay. I get to be your attendant. `
`Come, princess. `
`What wish do you want granted...? `
`Let's hear it." `
`"I've...already chosen my wish..." `
`"Oh. `
`And what is it? `
`Won't you tell your aunt?" `
`I want this fun time to keep on going. `
`...Forever. `
`The young me spoke for the desire in my heart. `
`"...Wh-What we were doing before this was fun, so I'd like to keep doing it!" `
`I get the feeling that the nuance has changed. `
`Still, that was unmistakably my wish. `
`"What we were doing before this? `
`...Oh, you mean those tricks and quizzes?" `
`"Yeah!" `
`"Then let's do this. `
`Listen up, everyone. `
`This is an order from your princess. `
`Remember how much fun we were having earlier? `
`Let's all entertain Ange-chan with tricks and quizzes." `
`"Hold up there. `
`I've already used up all my magic tricks." `
`"Then let's do quizzes and riddles." `
`"So, we just need to entertain Ange-chan with quizzes?" `
`"We can all present quizzes for our princess to enjoy." `
`"I see. `
`Understood." `
`"Wahahaha! `
`Yes, how intriguing. `
`Then, Ange, let us do it this way. `
`Everyone will give you a quiz or a riddle, and you can try to solve them. `
`Each time you succeed, I will give you a medal." `
`"A medal?" `
`"He probably means some sort of commemorative medallion. `
`If you get a lot of puzzles right, you'll get a lot of medals." `
`"Hohohohohoho. `
`Just gathering medals is a tad boring, don't you think?" `
`"Yes. `
`Depending on the number of medals you collect, I shall give you a fantastic present...! `
`Well, do you suddenly feel fired up?!" `
`"It sounds amazing. `
`So, there's even a prize...!" `
`"*giggle* `
`Isn't that great, Ange?" `
`"...Y-Yeah...!" `
`Everyone gathered around me, smiling, as they thought about what sort of puzzle they'd give. `
`They're all thinking about me, so that they can play with me. `
`Just the feel of having that all to myself almost made me explode with joy at becoming the princess. `
