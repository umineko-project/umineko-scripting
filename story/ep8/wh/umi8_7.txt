`"Who should we get a puzzle from next?" `
`"What about those two?" `
`"Shannon-chan and Kanon-kun? `
`Sure, it looks like they'll put up a good fight." `
`"Do you need something, Eva-sama and Ange-sama?" `
`"...Don't be stupid, Nee-san. `
`They're asking us for puzzles." `
`"Ah, m-my apologies!" `
`Shannon was as absentminded as ever. `
`However, Kanon looked extremely calm, and would probably have a well-polished puzzle ready. `
`"Ummm, uhhhhh......" `
`"...*sigh*. `
`Okay, I'll go first. `
`Use that time to think up a puzzle, Nee-san." `
`"O-Okay. Sorry..." `
`"So, if I'm buying time for Nee-san to think up a puzzle, I'll have to make one tricky enough to keep you stumped for a while." `
`"Heheheheh, you've got guts, kid. `
`Let's have it, shall we? `
`Show us the hardest one you've got!" `
`"Don't provoke him! `
`I want a easy one!" `
`"Now that I have Eva-sama's permission, allow me to present an insanely difficult puzzle." `
`"Leave this to me. `
`I'll solve it!" `
`"The number of coins are really different, and kind of weird." `
`"Wait a second, Kanon-kun! What are you thinking?! `
`There's no way she'll be able to get this one, right?!" `
`"This is just to buy time until Nee-san can think up a question, so forgive me." `
`"Th-Thank you...! `
`I've thought of a question...!" `
`"...Understood. `
`Now then, Eva-sama and Ange-sama, `
`I'll give you a hint. `
`......Copper is 29, silver is 47, and gold is 79. `
`That's the hint." `
`"That's just what you said in the question...! `
`That's not a hint!" `
`"...Copper is 29? `
`Silver is 47?? `
`......Oh, so that's it!" `
`"Huh? `
`You got it?! `
`I get it too! `
`Platinum is better than gold, so the prize must be more than 79 gold coins!" `
`"That's wrong. `
`With these rules, the platinum prize is probably worth less than the gold prize. `
`Isn't that right?" `
`"...It is as you say. `
`It seems you've already found the answer." `
`"This puzzle is impossible for Ange-chan. `
`You'd need to have gone to middle school at the very least. `
`I'll answer! `
`Is that all right, Ange-chan?" `
`"S-Sure. `
`I'll leave it to you...!" `
`"Incorrect." `
`"Aaaaaaaahhh, sorry, I messed up!! `
`If only I'd taken science class more seriously!" `
`"What do you mean? `
`I don't get it." `
`"The number of gold coins is the atomic number for each element. `
`Copper is 29, silver is 47, and gold is 79. `
`I can't remember what number platinum was...!!" `
`"I don't have a clue what you're talking about." `
`"You! `
`What kind of problem do you think you're giving Ange-chan?! `
`Can't you put a little more thought into your puzzles?!" `
`"You did give me permission to show her the hardest one I've got." `
`"...That's right. `
`You said it yourself. `
`That's why we got a puzzle that was too hard for me." `
`"Nnggggggggggghhhh...!! `
`...S-Sorry, Ange-chan..." `
`Aunt Eva clenched her hands together, grimacing. `
`It was just too hard, and I didn't have a clue... `
`"......Correct." `
`"Awesome, Aunt Eva! `
`Why?! `
`Why is it 78 coins?! `
`If platinum is better than gold, then why does gold get more coins?!" `
`"The number of coins you get is always the same as the atomic number of the prize. `
`Copper is 29, silver is 47, and gold is 79. `
`And, by the way, platinum is 78. `
`So, the platinum prize gets you 78 gold coins." `
`"...A-Aunt Eva, you're incredible!!" `
`Dad once told me that Aunt Eva was an enthusiastic studier, and really, really smart even back when she was in school. `
`Even George onii-chan, her son, is smart, so Aunt Eva must really be incredible. `
`"Still, that was a pretty nasty riddle to choose. `
`You should have at least given one that Ange could understand." `
`"You did give me permission to show her the hardest one I've got." `
`"...That's right. `
`You said it yourself. `
`That's why we got a puzzle that was too hard for me." `
`"Nnggggggggggghhhh...!! `
`I-Is it my fault? `
`Sorry, Ange-chan... `
`But look, we got a medal, so please forgive me." `
`We got another medal. `
`Just how many have we gotten so far? `
`But we still have a lot left to get. `
`Next up is Shannon. `
`"Mine isn't that hard, so you can relax." `
`"After all, you managed to think it up." `
`"Y-You're making fun of me...! `
`Then do you want to have a go at it too, Kanon-kun?" `
`"Bring it on." `
`"It sounds like you'll be able to understand it this time, Ange-chan. `
`I'll stick to giving hints again." `
`"Okay, I'll do my best. `
`I'll solve it. `
`Another medal for me." `
`"Let's go then. `
`Listen carefully..." `
`"I don't get it. `
`What do the letters mean...?" `
`"...Could it be the first letter of each word?" `
`"That's what I thought at first. `
`White chocolate starts with "W", pepper jack starts with "P", and anchovy starts with "A". `
`But then, `
`how do you explain lemonade being "O"?" `
`"Heheheheheheheh. `
`Do you get it?" `
`"Don't you have any more hints for me?" `
`"I do. `
`I'll teach you the letters for some other foods. `
`First, walnut cake is "W". `
`Albacore tuna is an "A". `
`For "P", how about picante potatoes? `
`Iced green tea can be an "I". `
`Heheheheheheheh......" `
`"It really does sound like the first letter is the key... `
`But then how do you explain black coffee being "I"......?" `
`"......I love "W" foods. `
`Cream cakes are "W", right?" `
`"That's right." `
`"So, `
`it isn't the first letter after all..." `
`"What's going on? `
`What is this "W" group? `
`White chocolate and walnut cake, right? `
`Are these desserts? `
`Treats? `
`"A" is anchovy pizza and albacore tuna? `
`"P" is picante potatoes and piri piri chicken curry, and "I" is coffee and green tea? `
`Just what are these groups??" `
`"......I sort of get it, but I sort of don't. `
`......It's a little annoying." `
`"One last hint. `
`Have you ever had lemonade to drink?" `
`"I have. `
`I thought it was just going to be sweet, so I was really surprised. `
`I'll never drink it again." `
`"...Ah, ...I've got it! `
`Ange-chan, thank you. `
`Thanks to you, I've probably figured it out!" `
`"Giving up? `
`What about you, Kanon-kun?" `
`"...I don't get it. `
`...I think I almost do, but..." `
`"Yeah. `
`I almost know what all the groups mean, but I can't figure out that last step." `
`"It's...tastes, right?" `
`"Yes, that's right. `
`Have you figured it out now, Ange-sama and Kanon-kun?" `
`"I don't get it! `
`What is it, Aunt Eva? `
`Tell me!" `
`"Everything in the "W" group is sweet, right? `
`So, what about the "A" group? `
`The "P" group?" `
`".........I see, so that's what it was... `
`Not bad, coming from you, Nee‐san..." `
`"Why don't you try saying "sorry for making fun of you"? `
`If you don't, I'll make all your meals "O" and "I"." `
`"‘O’ is one thing, but eating "I" all the time would be awful." `
`In the end, Kanon caved under the threat of "I" cooking and was forced to apologize to Shannon. `
`Ange was still confused. `
`No point thinking about it anymore. `
`I've got to pull myself together and take a shot at the next one. `
`"See, Ange-chan? `
`Think about the tastes of all these foods! `
`How does white chocolate taste?" `
`"Sweet." `
`"And what about anchovy pizza?" `
`"Salty." `
`"Then how about piri piri chicken curry? `
`And black coffee?!" `
`"......I see, so that's what it is......" `
`"Piri piri is spicy. `
`Coffee is bitter. `
`......So what is it? `
`Do the letters match the tastes?" `
`"That's right! `
`The second letter of "sweet" is "W". `
`The second letter of "salty" is "A", "spicy" is "P", and "bitter" is "I"! `
`So, what does lemonade taste like?" `
`"Sour!" `
`"Exactly! `
`And the second letter of "sour" is... "O"! `
`So the answer for lemonade is "O"!" `
`"Nice job. `
`You got it right, Eva-sama and Ange-sama." `
`"Aunt Eva, you're so awesome!!" `
`"We had to work together to solve that one. `
`It's a team effort." `
`"And here is my medal. `
`Please take it." `
`"All right, I got another medal! `
`Thanks!" `
`"You didn't get it, did you, Kanon-kun? `
`I'll bet it was hard." `
`"...Not bad, coming from you, Nee-san..." `
`"Why don't you try saying "Sorry for making fun of you"? `
`If you don't, I'll make all your meals "O" and "I"." `
`""O" is one thing, but eating "I" all the time would be awful." `
`"I wanna eat "W" all the time!" `
`"Careful, you'll get cavities. `
`But if you ever come to my house to play, I'd be more than willing to share." `
`"Yay!! `
`I love you, Aunt Eva!!" `
`In the end, Kanon caved under the threat of "I" cooking `
`and was forced to apologize to Shannon... `
`"That's all for our puzzles. `
`Did you enjoy them...?" `
`"Yeah. `
`Thanks!" `
`"It seems the others still have some brain-twisters waiting for you. `
`Please be careful." `
`"Good point. `
`Everyone left looks like they'll be a challenge." `
`"But we'll win! `
`We can do it if we work together...!" `
`"That's right. `
`Let's combine our wits and move on!" `
`"Goodbye. `
`And good luck." `
`Shannon and Kanon returned to the kitchen with the serving cart. `
`The dining hall was filled with such an exciting and fun atmosphere, `
`but out here in the corridor, one was reminded of the fierce winds and the rain. `
`But, they were satisfied with this. `
`The whole point of this noisy farewell party was to forget the loneliness of the rain for just a little bit. `
`"...So, we've reached the end of this long game..." `
`"I feel relieved. `
`...Finally, we won't have to be toys for anyone else. `
`...I'd like to be quietly forgotten, to get covered with dust and vanish." `
`"You're wrong. `
`We aren't going to vanish like that." `
`"............" `
`"In the world locked inside the cat box, our future will continue, unknown to anyone." `
`"...You're right. `
`...Sorry. `
`That's a world that even we can't know about, ...so I forgot." `
`"Just what kind of future will we make for ourselves in the cat box world?" `
`"I don't know. That's why it's called a cat box." `
`"......Good point." `
`"Don't you have any regrets, Nee-san? `
`...About George-sama, for instance?" `
`"........." `
`"Receiving that ring is all you can do for George-sama. `
`As for marriage, living together, and all the rest..." `
`"Our future inside the cat box is what will make all that come true, isn't it? `
`...I'm not the only one. `
`It's the same for you, right? `
`What about a future for you and Milady Jessica?" `
`"...I'm..." `
`"I could break off my engagement with George-sama, then leave the island and disappear. `
`That future is also possible for me. `
`In that world, you wouldn't have to hesitate for my sake. ...You could enjoy your youth to the fullest with Milady." `
`"...If you gave up on your engagement with George-sama, that sort of world might be possible." `
`"So, `
`...since it's a cat box, `
`the world where I spend my life with George-sama and the world where you spend your life with Milady can both exist at the same time." `
`"...It's a world where any contradicting dreams can exist at once." `
`"That's the world we'll be put away in as pieces. `
`...So, there's no need to be lonely, no need to be sad. `
`...Even though the "me" here right now can only observe the part where I accept George-sama's ring." `
`The other "me" who lives in the cat box, in a world I cannot witness, `
`will surely build a happy life in the future... `
`The cat box is such a strange thing, a place where any pieces and toys and dreams can be kept. `
`It's no cage sealing us in. `
`On the contrary, being inside the cat box means being free from everything in countless worlds... `
`"A world where we're freed from everything, and yet where all of our wishes come true. `
`...However, the "me" in that world won't be the "me" here and now. `
`...That's a bit depressing." `
`"...Hey, Kanon-kun." `
`"Yes...?" `
`"Let's do it." `
`"...Do what?" `
`"Let's have a duel." `
`"......Are you sure?" `
`"We both wish we'd settled this much sooner. `
`And yet, we've put it off until the last moment, just before the game is going to end." `
`"...Sure. `
`...The game is nearly over anyway. `
`Now, at the very end, `
`...it's time for us to settle things by ourselves." `
`"That way, we'll be able to see our future before we're put away in the cat box." `
`"...Sure. `
`Let's do it. `
`...How will we decide it? `
`A coin? `
`Or with pistols again...?" `
`"Ummm, `
`...in that case, why don't we have our own quiz tournament?" `
`"...Huh? `
`...You're really getting into this." `
`"Okay, then... `
`First question-" `
`"Kihhihihihihihihi! `
`I'm gonna give Ange a reeeeally hard one! `
`I'll trick her with my extra-hard puzzle and make sure she neeever gets my medal!" `
`"I'll solve it. `
`I'll definitely solve it...!" `
`As soon as Maria and Ange crossed gazes, they started fighting. `
`The two girls so close in age were really good friends, but they also fought a lot. `
`Especially when they were opponents in a game. `
`"Maria-chan probably knows tons of different quizzes. `
`This should be interesting. `
`Let's have it." `
`"Kihhihihihi, not now. `
`I'm the star, so I'll go after Mama!" `
`"Really? `
`You're sure it's okay for me to go first?" `
`"Yeah!" `
`"Then let's begin. `
`Ready? `
`Heheheheheh." `
`"Hmmmm... I guess you don't need a hint for this one." `
`"*giggle* You're right. `
`I made it for Ange-chan. `
`It's probably a bit too easy for you, Nee-san." `
`"An hour is 60 minutes, and it takes 8 minutes for each round trip..." `
`"Good luck. `
`I know you can solve it. `
`I won't give you a hint this time." `
`"Huh? `
`Why is that wrong...?!" `
`"Heheh, sorry about that. `
`I guess that was a little mean." `
`"The key to the puzzle is the part about how many can she "carry out"." `
`...Oh. `
`Looks like I made a pretty simple mistake. `
`I've been taking on so many tricky riddles, I've gotten a bit too tense. `
`"That's all for my puzzle. `
`Now, for the one you've been waiting for. `
`Good luck with Maria's puzzle!" `
`"8 ingots...!" `
`"Heheh, are you sure? `
`It takes eight minutes to carry each ingot to the surface, right? `
`8x8 is more than 60." `
`"That's right. `
`But the question was "How many can she carry out of the room?" `
`Rosa only has to take one step out of the room to "carry it out"." `
`"Nice going, Ange-chan...! `
`All those puzzles have really warmed you up good." `
`"That's right. `
`To do 7 trips, you need 8X7=56 minutes. `
`There are only 4 minutes left. `
`However, you can make it back to the underground room in 3 minutes, then "carry out" the eighth ingot in the last minute." `
`"Kihihihihihihi... `
`Not bad, Ange! `
`Nice one, uu-." `
`"I'm not gonna lose to you, Maria onee-chan!" `
`"Congratulations. `
`Here's my medal. `
`Now you can try the puzzle Maria picked out just for you." `
`"So, it's finally my turn. `
`Kihihihihi, you took so long on Mama's easy puzzle that I got a little worried. `
`There's no way you'll ever solve this one!" `
`"I've got Aunt Eva with me, and we'll solve it together!" `
`"Kihihihihihi, impossible, impossible, impossible! `
`Even Aunt Eva can't solve this one! `
`Wolves and Sheep puzzles are incredibly hard...!" `
`From her handbag, `
`Maria pulled out a "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle Book" that was worn-out, well-used, and had a majestic feel to it, like a grimoire. `
`"You know what a Wolves and Sheep puzzle is, right?" `
`"I know. `
`You show me those all the time." `
`"They're puzzles about using a boat to take everyone from one shore of a river to another." `
`"They usually have a few bizarre rules. `
`When there's wolves and sheep, you can't let the number of wolves on either shore get bigger than the number of sheep, right?" `
`"Yeah, that's right! `
`Send a boat back and forth, moving everyone to the other side while making sure that there are never more wolves than sheep...!! `
`But the ones with just wolves and sheep are the simplest, easiest, plainest beginner's basic practice puzzles...!" `
`"When you get to the higher levels, you have many things other than wolves and sheep. `
`It's pretty clever." `
`"...Should we write this down on a piece of paper?" `
`"Good idea. That'll definitely make it easier for you to sort out your thoughts." `
`"*sigh* ...Sounds like this puzzle will be a handful." `
`"There's no way you're getting my medal, Ange! `
`Kihihihihihihi!!" `
`"I won't lose. I'm not gonna lose!!" `
`"W-Wait a second... `
`Who ever heard of a puzzle with such complicated rules?!" `
`"Did you only know about the ones with wolves and sheep? `
`It's got lots of complicated puzzles that you've got to deal with in different ways! `
`See? `
`You don't get it either, right, Ange?! `
`Kihihihihihi!" `
`"Please, give me a hint!" `
`"You have to organize your thoughts carefully. `
`Only the three humans can row the boat. `
`Then, you have to memorize all the things to look out for. `
`When the peasant is away, you can't leave his wife with the shepherd. `
`When both the peasant and his wife are away, you can't leave the shepherd with the meat. `
`When the shepherd is away, you can't leave the sheep with the veggies. `
`You also need someone to watch the cow, but any of the humans can do that. `
`Still, I guess the meat is the real key to the whole thing." `
`"...Ah, I see. `
`You can't put it on the boat again once you take it off, but that doesn't mean you can only take it across once." `
`"That's right. `
`The veggies really can make only one trip, so once you've sent them across, you can't get them back. `
`But as long as you don't take the meat off the boat, you can take it back and forth as much as you want." `
`"...It's so complicated. `
`Even after thinking about it, I don't get it at all..." `
`"We'll have to write it down and sort out our ideas. `
`Do you want a pen and paper too, `
`Ange-chan?" `
`"Impossible, impossible! You'll never solve it! `
`If only you'd just give up. `
`Thinking is a waste of time for the incompetent! `
`Kihihihihihihihihi...!" `
`"Can this really be solved? `
`Don't tell me there's actually some contradiction that makes it unsolvable..." `
`"Uuu---? `
`Who knows? `
`Kiiihihihihihihi!" `
`"Kihihihihihihi!! `
`Wrong! `
`You can't even do this one?! `
`You suck, Ange, kihihihihihihihihihi, `
`ouch!" `
`"Maria! `
`Show some manners!" `
`I thought so hard before getting that answer, but Maria onee-chan just burst out laughing. `
`The laughter broke off when Aunt Rosa hit her, but then she was grinning again. `
`"I don't get it at all. What was the difficulty level for this one...?" `
`"Just about 20 picarats, I guess? `
`Lots of the puzzles in this book are much, much harder!" `
`I don't know what a pica-thing is, `
`but apparently, even this puzzle doesn't count as a hard one for Maria onee-chan... `
`I hung my head dejectedly. `
`Maria onee-chan kept on laughing until Aunt Rosa smacked her again. `
`"This really is a nasty problem. Can it really be solved? `
`Is there some trick to it, like throwing things into the river without using the boat, `
`or making the cow eat the vegetables so that they can be carried as one passenger...?" `
`"Well, who knows? `
`If that's as far as you can go, maybe you should give up, right...?" `
`"This one's really hard! `
`Even Mama couldn't solve it! `
`But I solved it on my first try!" `
`"So, do you get it? `
`How many trips does it take to get every person across?" `
`"This isn't a cheap trick or a riddle, right? `
`There's no way you can solve this straightforwardly, right?!" `
`"No, that's not true. `
`I'm sure you'll get it Nee-san, smart as you are. `
`How many trips does it take to get every person across?" `
`"I've got it. `
`Three trips." `
`"...Huh? `
`Three?! `
`How...?!" `
`"It's easy. `
`The peasant and his wife get on the boat, then the wife gets dropped off on the other side in the first move. `
`Then, the peasant takes the boat back across in the second move. `
`Then, he crosses with the shepherd in the third move." `
`"But what about the cow and the sheep?! `
`What about the meat and the vegetables?!" `
`"But Aunt Eva, it said to take every person across, right? `
`Those other things aren't people." `
`"Huh? Ah......" `
`As Aunt Eva's mouth flopped open, Aunt Rosa started applauding. `
`After clicking her tongue, Maria onee-chan joined in. `
`"That's right. `
`The question just asks how many moves it would take to move each person across. `
`The animals and luggage never had anything to do with it." `
`"They only got it because you kept saying "every person" over and over again, Mama. `
`Uu!" `
`Aunt Rosa had probably said it so much as a sort of hint. `
`Without that, even I wouldn't have figured it out. `
`"Come on. `
`I was totally taken in. `
`That was a mean question!" `
`"Go on, Maria. `
`Give Ange-chan her medal." `
`"Uu-uu-uu-..." `
`Whining like a unhappy dog, she reluctantly handed the medal over. `
`I grabbed it and started jumping around like a happy dog. `
`As Maria onee-chan smiled at me from behind, ...her face was bright, just like a big sister's. `
`"That's the end of our riddles. `
`Let's play again sometime, okay?" `
`"Next time, I'll have a really nasty puzzle that's even harder...! `
`One so hard that even I couldn't solve it!" `
`"No way! `
`I'm not playing with Maria onee-chan anymore...!!" `
`"*giggle* `
`Look, Ange-chan. `
`Your parents are waving at you, so let's go. `
`See you later, Rosa." `
`"Sure. `
`Later, Ange-chan. `
`There aren't too many people left with puzzles for you. `
`Keep it up until the end. `
`And make sure you keep cheering her on, Nee-san." `
`"Of course. `
`We got all these medals by working together, right?" `
`"Yeah!" `
`We dashed away. `
`Dad and Mom are waving at me from over there. `
`I'm sure they've thought up some mean problems. `
`Still, they have to be easier than Maria onee-chan's...! `
`I hate Maria onee-chan! She's such a meanie! `
`"Uryu-. `
`You bullied her too much with that puzzle..." `
`"Well, I wanted to play with Ange a lot. `
`If it was an easy one, she'd solve it right away, right?" `
`"You really love Ange, don't you?" `
`"I hate her. `
`She made fun of you and called you a stuffed animal." `
`Maria pouted as she said this, but her expression didn't match her words at all. `
`"I hope Ange finds happiness." `
`"I'm sure she will. `
`After all, look at all the people here wishing for her happiness. `
`And now, Battler is the Game Master, and he's set up this final game just for Ange. `
`...After all this, there's no way she won't be happy." `
`"...Still, even though anyone can make happiness appear, you can only ever grasp it for yourself." `
`"That's right. `
`That kid is really bad at finding Fragments of happiness. `
`Even though we tried to teach her how, she's been covering her ears for 12 full years. `
`...This game might be much harder for Ange than Battler thinks." `
`"...I'm sure Ange will find happiness." `
`"Yeah. `
`...If she really does enjoy herself at this party, `
`that itself might be the greatest lesson we can teach her now." `
`Ange is the girl who doesn't believe and says that everything is a trick, no matter what magic is shown to her... `
`12 years in the future, that girl will become the last person to inherit {f:5:Beatrice}'s name. `
`"At one point in time, that kid understood my white magic." `
`"Yeah. `
`And she understood me too." `
`"She even summoned all of the Seven Sisters and understood magic itself. `
`...And yet, she still can't use magic on herself." `
`"Let us believe. `
`Just as Battler did once, in the past." `
`"...Beato." `
`"It is easy to cast magic on others. `
`And believing in other people's magic is not so difficult. `
`The hardest thing is casting magic on yourself." `
`"Is that...something Ange can do...?" `
`"She can. `
`Even Battler managed to understand magic. `
`Of course his little sister will be able to do the same." `
`"You're right. `
`...There are some kinds of magic that we can only see when we're kids. `
`...And there are some that only adults can understand. `
`Right now, Ange is between the two of those." `
`"She's lost the magic of children, but she has yet to understand the magic of adults. It's the most painful period of one's life." `
`"It's so sad...that she didn't have anyone close to her at a time like that..." `
`"That's not true. `
`We're always by that kid's side. `
`She just doesn't believe it." `
`Ange, please, realize that quickly. `
`There are so many people smiling at you from behind, watching over you. `
`If you just turn around, we'll be able to smile so much more...and talk to you so much more. `
`......You're {f:5:Ange Beatrice}, the final witch of Mariage Sorcière. `
`"Even if you aren't able to do the right thing in the end, `
`...I pray that you can at least enjoy yourself tonight..." `
`Have fun, Ange. `
`So long. `
`The time we spent together feels so long, yet so short. `
`Even so, for me, those memories are eternal... `
`"How's it going, Ange? `
`Did you get a ton of medals?" `
`"I wonder how many it is now!" `
`"Me too. `
`Let's count them later, okay?!" `
`"It seems you've been given quite a few puzzles already." `
`"Yeah. `
`Once I get your puzzles, I think only the cousins are left." `
`"Is that so, huh? `
`All right. `
`Time to take a shot at Mom and Dad's puzzles! `
`I'll warn you, they're gonna be hard!" `
`"Everyone says the same thing, but we just keep on solving them!" `
`"Yeah! `
`We'll get those medals together!" `
`"*giggle* `
`That's the spirit. `
`Okay, I guess I'll go first." `
`"Ah, it's a classic liar puzzle. `
`Those are the ones I'm best at." `
`"Don't you mean lying is what you're best at?" `
`Wow. `
`I didn't think Dad's ears could stretch that far. `
`"Only one of them is speaking the truth. `
`And both of the others are lying. `
`So, if you find an answer where two of them are telling the truth, it's wrong." `
`"...I don't really get it. `
`I want some more hints." `
`"That's all for my hint. `
`If you want more, try talking to Aunt Eva." `
`"Aunt Eva!" `
`"Rika is the key. `
`Rika says that Miyoko is a liar. `
`So, if Miyoko is speaking the truth, then Rika is a liar, and if Miyoko is lying, then Rika is speaking the truth. `
`...In other words, since that pair contradicts each other, we know that one of them is lying and one is telling the truth." `
`"That's Eva nee-san for you. `
`Exactly. `
`In liar games like this one, when you see a pair that contradicts each other, you know that one of them must be telling the truth. `
`Neither of them is Satoko, so she's already confirmed as a liar. `
`...*giggle* Looks like the answer's already popped up." `
`"Ummm, ......???" `
`"Too bad, but that's not it." `
`"I guess Ange's still too little for that one." `
`"Am not! `
`I just made a little mistake! `
`I'll get it right next time. So, one more...!" `
`"Aw, and you were so close too..." `
`"Then you can make up for it with my puzzle. `
`Okay, let's try another one of those liar games. `
`Will you be able to get it this time?" `
`"Rika!" `
`"That's right! `
`Nice job, Ange-chan! `
`Hard to imagine such a smart girl being related to that dolt of a father!" `
`"Yeah, sorry for being a dolt. `
`Nice going, Ange! `
`Did you think of all the combinations?" `
`"Yeah. `
`If Miyoko is the oldest, then what Satoko says is true. `
`Only the oldest person is supposed to tell the truth, so that doesn't make sense." `
`"That's right. `
`Then what if Satoko is the oldest?" `
`"If she is, then Rika would be telling the truth when she says Miyoko is a liar, which doesn't work. `
`So, Rika has to be the oldest." `
`"Good job. `
`Here's my medal for you. `
`Congrats." `
`"Thank you, Mom!" `
`"Rudolf is up next. `
`I wonder what sort of puzzle he has for us." `
`"Well, guess I'll do a liar puzzle too. `
`Let's crank it up a notch this time..." `
`"They're all wearing masks, ...and except for Miyoko, we can't tell if they're lying or telling the truth. `
`...This one's hard." `
`"No, it isn't. `
`I've already figured it out. `
`This is even easier than the one your mom gave a second ago." `
`"Why?" `
`"You can't trust the two who aren't Miyoko, so you first need to figure out who Miyoko is. `
`Miyoko doesn't lie, right?" `
`"Yeah. `
`Miyoko doesn't lie." `
`"So, start off by figuring out who Miyoko is, then read through the puzzle again. `
`I'm sure you'll see it at once." `
`"Just think about who Miyoko is... `
`Okay, I've got it." `
`"You really do whatever Eva nee-san tells you." `
`"Yeah. `
`Aunt Eva is nice and smart, and I like her. `
`So I do what she tells me!" `
`"Next time we try to feed Ange eggplant and bell peppers, we'll need to ask her to lend a hand." `
`"*giggle*giggle*..." `
`"Toooo bad!! `
`That's wrong." `
`"Huh?! `
`I got it wrong? I got it wrong?!" `
`"Later on, try thinking it over with Aunt Eva. `
`I'm sure you'll figure it out soon." `
`"Think about it. `
`Miyoko speaks the truth, right? `
`So, is it possible for someone to be Miyoko if they say the person next to them is Miyoko?" `
`Miyoko speaks the truth. `
`So, she should say that she is Miyoko. `
`She wouldn't say that someone else was Miyoko. `
`...Once you realize that, it's probably easy to figure out who Miyoko is. `
`I've figured out the knack of it, but too late. `
`Too bad... `
`"I know who Miyoko is. `
`She's on the left. `
`After all, the girls in the middle and on the right both say that someone else is Miyoko. `
`If they were Miyoko, they couldn't lie and say that someone else was Miyoko." `
`"That's right. `
`Miyoko is supposed to be honest. `
`So, once someone says that someone else is Miyoko, they can't be her." `
`"So, since the middle one and the right one aren't Miyoko, the left one automatically is. `
`And since Miyoko speaks the truth, then it's also true that the kid on the right is Satoko." `
`"Which means that the only kid left, the one in the middle, is Rika. `
`Perfect!" `
`"You solved it like it was nothing! `
`Ange, you really are smart like your Mom!" `
`Dad rubbed my cheek and hugged me. `
`"That's all for our puzzles." `
`"Listen up, Ange. `
`Life will lead you through countless puzzles. `
`...Aunt Eva is here to help you now, so it's okay to rely on her. `
`However, you'll have to solve most problems in life by yourself. `
`When that happens, you must remember the advice you've gotten from those who have helped you in the past." `
`"Okay. `
`I get it." `
`"...Eva nee-san, `
`take care of Ange." `
`"Yes, of course." `
`Even though the cousins were the only ones who hadn't given us puzzles, `
`Mom spoke as though I was leaving on a long, long trip. `
`...Weird. `
`"Let's go, Ange-chan. `
`The game will be over soon." `
`"I wonder what Grandpa will give us for getting all these medals...!" `
`"Me too. `
`Still, we've already gotten many things that are far more wonderful than that prize." `
`"What do you mean...?" `
`"We've all had a lot of fun talking to you like this, Ange-chan." `
`"......? `
`I don't get it. `
`You're weird." `
`"I'm sorry. `
`Let's go then. `
`Now, all that's left are the cousins and {f:5:Beatrice}, I guess." `
`"What is it? `
`Why did you tell me to come over here? `
`......Is it something to do with Ange?" `
`"No, that's not it. `
`............" `
`Rudolf put a cigarette in his mouth and toyed with his lighter. `
`...Though he should have done this easily, he somehow managed to mess up several times. `
`"I...wanted to take this to my grave. `
`...No, to hide it away in a cat box. `
`If I just kept my mouth shut until tomorrow night, I'd be able to do that. `
`It'd be easy." `
`"............" `
`"I...might be killed tonight. `
`...That's what I wanted to talk about." `
`"...I knew it. `
`I knew you were hiding something." `
`"Did you? `
`Guess I still need more practice." `
`"......If it isn't about Ange, then who is it about? `
`You aren't talking about Asumu-san, right...?" `
`"It's about Battler." `
`"...It comes to the same thing. `
`I've tried to behave as an adult towards Battler-kun, right? `
`Even though he's Asumu's son, I've tried to treat him the same as Ange. `
`I do think of him as a child in our family, so don't worry." `
`"He's not just a kid in our family. `
`He's my kid and yours." `
`"I'm sorry, but you'll have to let me draw the line there." `
`"You don't get it. `
`He's my kid...and yours." `
`"......What?" `
`"You didn't have a stillbirth. `
`Asumu did. `
`...Back then, when I was double-timing the two of you, I got myself stuck and couldn't find a way out..." `
`"You don't...mean..." `
`"...Asumu and I were married. `
`You and I were cheating. `
`Then, Asumu had a stillbirth, and you gave birth. `
`...My head was a mess with it all." `
`The sin Rudolf committed when his mind was at its most chaotic... `
`...was to switch the two babies. `
`"I was even better off financially back then. `
`I was young, and I didn't give a damn about what lengths I went to. `
`...I threatened the hospital while slapping them with money...and switched your kid with Asumu's." `
`If Kyrie had a child, Rudolf would have to maintain two households. `
`However, if Kyrie had a stillbirth and the child who survived was Asumu's, that would settle everything. `
`...The stillbirth might even have given him a chance to break off his relationship with Kyrie. `
`...It was a grave sin, one that simply couldn't be forgiven as an act of youthful enthusiasm and immaturity. `
`"......That's why...I should be apologizing to all three of you. `
`...I forced Asumu to raise a kid that wasn't hers. `
`...That woman wasn't anywhere near as generous and accepting as she looked. `
`...There's a chance she figured it out. `
`...However, she raised Battler, who loved her as a mother, with all the affection she had." `
`And in Kyrie and Battler's cases, ...he had to atone for an even greater sin. `
`He stole every moment of everyday family life that they should have shared as mother and son. `
`Until this very day, Kyrie had believed that Battler was Asumu's child. `
`Though she had acted kindly towards him on the surface, she had always kept a distance in her heart between herself and Asumu's son. `
`Finally, ...Rudolf's conscience had been unable to bear seeing her like that. `
`"...But, ...I..." `
`Kyrie sank into a crouch, unable to speak. `
`"...Feel free to curse me. `
`In fact, I couldn't complain if you killed me where I stand. `
`That's how horrible my sin against you is. `
`...This is the secret I wanted to confess before the cat box closes over us." `
`"Battler...kun......" `
`"I'm so sorry, Kyrie. `
`...And to you, Battler......" `
`"Come to think of it, we've already gone through a ton of puzzles." `
`"Yeah. `
`Now, there's only George onii-chan, Jessica onee-chan, Battler onii-chan, and {f:5:Beatrice} left." `
`"Oh, they're finally here." `
`"We could hardly wait. `
`Thought you might have forgotten about us." `
`Finally, we challenged George onii-chan and Jessica onee-chan. `
`"Sorry to keep you two waiting. `
`So, did you think up some incredibly hard ones for us?" `
`"We decided to give you one puzzle together." `
`"My, my, even one riddle from this pair sounds challenging." `
`"It's a special puzzle we made just for Ange-chan, so good luck." `
`"I'll solve it. I'll definitely solve it!" `
`"Okay, then let's go. `
`Jessica-chan, let's set them out." `
`"There you go." `
`They placed three small, colorful, cubic boxes on the table. `
`"Two of these are traps! `
`The other has a medal inside." `
`"Ange-chan, do you think you can guess which one has the medal in it...?" `
`"Not without a hint. `
`That would just be luck!" `
`"That's right. So far, this is just a test of luck with three choices. `
`In other words, your odds of winning are one in three." `
`"George, `
`this isn't a quiz. `
`It really is just a test of luck." `
`"The puzzle comes later. `
`Let's continue." `
`"Okay, Ange. `
`Which of these has a medal inside, do you think? `
`Just say the first one that pops into your head." `
`A red box, a blue box, and a green box. `
`There's no way to know which one it's in. `
`...This really is...a test of luck. `
`In a way, this is even worse than a hard puzzle. `
`After all, if you solve a hard puzzle, you'll always be right. `
`...But in the very beginning, I picked the almond with a 1 in 15 chance. `
`Compared to that, a 1 in 3 chance is 5 times easier to get. `
`There's no point worrying about it. `
`Might as well test my luck again. `
`"Then, ......this one." `
`"The red box? `
`Then let's set this box right in front of you. `
`...Wouldn't it be great if there was a medal inside? `
`So, let's start with a little warm-up. `
`What's the probability of the medal being inside that red box?" `
`"1 in 3." `
`"That's right. `
`If this really is a simple test of luck." `
`"Heheheheh. `
`Are you sure, Ange? `
`Are you aaabsolutely sure you're happy with that red box? `
`After all, we're gonna make you open it in a second. `
`...If it's a trap, it'll be reeeally scary." `
`Jessica onee-chan grinned threateningly. `
`"Are you happy with the red box? `
`...The medal might be in the blue box or the green box. `
`Do you want to change your mind?" `
`It's not fair for them to scare me like that, not after I've already made my choice. `
`And I know. `
`All of the boxes have the same probability of having a medal in them. `
`Whether I try to open the red box or change my mind and try the blue or green boxes, the probability will be the same. `
`So, stick with your first choice is my motto. `
`I'll stay with this red box. `
`I won't change my mind. `
`"I'm happy with the red box. `
`I'll bet on it!" `
`"That's the spirit. `
`But seriously, the traps are terrifying. `
`Why don't we show you just how scary they are?" `
`Jessica onee-chan laughed creepily, then opened the green box. `
`And then, `
`*bang*! `
`Pumpkin monsters and ribbon came flying out of the box. `
`...It scared me a little. `
`...No, that's a lie. `
`It scared me a lot... `
`If that came flying out of the box I opened, right at my face, I might fall to my knees and start crying... `
`"Ange, are you sure you want the red box...? `
`Something really scary might come flying out, okay...? `
`Are you sure you don't want to switch to the blue box...?" `
`"I'm not scared! `
`I'll stick with the red box!" `
`"Hahahahaha, you're going a bit overboard, Jessica-chan. `
`So, one of the boxes is now gone, and there's only two left. `
`This is where the puzzle starts, Ange-chan." `
`"You mean, which box is the medal in?" `
`"We have the red box that's been sitting in front of you the whole time, and the blue box here in front of me. `
`Which has a higher probability of having a medal inside it? `
`That's the puzzle." `
`"Even though we don't know what's inside, there are two boxes, so there's a 50-50 chance of the medal being in either. `
`...They're both the same, aren't they?" `
`"...I thought that too. `
`Still, that would make the answer too obvious, wouldn't it? `
`I wonder if there's some trick here..." `
`Or, that itself might be the trick, and the obvious answer could be the right one. `
`It might be one of those classic puzzles that trips you up by making you think too hard and suspiciously. `
`"...... `
`I have two questions for you two. Is that okay?" `
`"Go ahead." `
`"Who do these three boxes belong to? `
`You, Jessica-chan?" `
`"Well, yeah." `
`"In other words, you know which colors are traps, right?" `
`"Yeah, of course." `
`"Thanks. `
`And now for my second question. `
`A second ago, you opened one of the boxes to show us how scary the traps were. `
`Would you have done that no matter which of the boxes Ange-chan chose?" `
`"That's right. `
`I figured giving her a bit of a scare would make for a nice psychological warfare tactic." `
`"Thanks. `
`Those hints will be enough." `
`"Hints? `
`Huh...??" `
`I'm completely lost. `
`How were Aunt Eva's questions just now hints...? `
`"Sorry. `
`That's wrong." `
`"What?! `
`...Wh-Why?!" `
`We started with three boxes. `
`When they set the red box in front of me, the odds of there being a medal inside were, obviously, one in three. `
`At the same time, the odds for the blue box were one in three, as were the odds for the green box. `
`Jessica onee-chan opened the green box, so there were then only two boxes left, and the odds became 50-50. `
`So, ...why was I wrong...??? `
`"...It was you George, wasn't it? `
`You thought this puzzle up. `
`Did the Monty Hall problem even exist in 1986?" `
`"Nope, not until 1990. `
`It's a puzzle that already exists in Ange-chan's world, so I thought it'd be okay to use it." `
`"George nii-san ran me through the answer, but I was totally lost. `
`...Anyway, I don't get the details, but in this case, `
`the odds of the blue box having the medal are about twice the odds of the red box having it." `
`Twice the odds? `
`...Even if there was a difference, I thought it'd be a tiny one. `
`...Probability is hard. `
`Didn't Onii-chan once say that people who don't get probability should never go gambling? `
`...I guess I'll never gamble for the rest of my life... `
`Aunt Eva nodded and patted my head encouragingly... `
`"Oh. `
`...The odds are better for the blue box!" `
`"Hmmm. `
`And why is that?" `
`"Well, ...I-I just sorta..." `
`"Think back to the 15 slice cake that you found the almond in. `
`If there was only one almond, the odds of winning were 1 in 15, right?" `
`"Yeah. `
`1 in 15." `
`I figured that out when the cake first appeared. `
`I'd thought that waiting for a lot of people to get wrong ones would make my chances for winning higher. `
`But, in the end, no matter when I ate my slice, the odds were still 1 in 15. `
`"Still, Ange-chan, `
`what if the servants were also having cake, `
`and it started with 20 slices?" `
`"......Huh? `
`...What...?" `
`"This is a party, right? `
`It's not fair that the servants don't get any cake, don't you think? `
`So, let's say it was originally a 20 slice cake. `
`The servants took out 5 slices, then redecorated it as a 15 slice cake and let you choose a slice. `
`If so, what would your chances of choosing the right slice be?" `
`If there really were 20 slices, `
`......then the chances would be 1 in 20. `
`"However, the servants know where the almond is, so they chose 5 slices for themselves that had no almonds. `
`In other words, they removed 5 losing slices. `
`That would mean your chances of winning were 1 in 15, not 1 in 20." `
`"...They took out losing slices, so the odds would obviously go up." `
`"Just now, Jessica-san did the same thing. `
`Jessica-chan removed one of the two boxes you didn't choose. `
`In other words, the odds that the remaining box you didn't choose was the winner went up a bit, right...?" `
`"Ahahahahahahahah, ...I sort of get it, but not really..." `
`If you remove a losing box, it's only natural that your chances of getting the right one go up. `
`And just now, Jessica onee-chan removed a losing box "from the pair of boxes I didn't choose". `
`So, doesn't it make sense that my odds of winning with "those boxes" went up...? `
`"...Now I'm getting confused..." `
`"Actually, you really are incredible, Ange-chan. `
`Even though you're only six, you're trying to understand posterior probability, a concept in probability theory. `
`Probability really is interesting. `
`I'm sure you'll like it when you get into high school and college. `
`Go and enjoy studying it all you can." `
`My little head was already filled to the brim. `
`Bewildered, I had to beg Aunt Eva for an explanation. `
`Aunt Eva wore a bitter smile too. `
`I'll bet she doesn't really get it herself. `
`As we felt a sense of connection through this failure, we happily grasped the medals we had wrangled out of them... `
`"Ange-chan, `
`could you come over here for a second?" `
`"......? `
`What is it, George onii-chan?" `
`George onii-chan and Jessica onee-chan were calling to me from the window. `
`Aunt Eva was talking with Mom and the others, and since it looked like they'd be a while, I went over to George onii-chan and Jessica onee-chan. `
`"What?" `
`"It looks like the quiz tournament is almost over." `
`"Yeah. `
`There's only Battler onii-chan and {f:5:Beatrice} left. `
`...I'm starting to get sleepy." `
`It's probably because of that adult drink I swiped from Dad. `
`I've felt floaty ever since I drank that. `
`...That floaty feeling keeps getting stronger, and I've been feeling sleepy for a while now. `
`I gave a huge yawn. `
`"Sleepy?" `
`"...Yeah. `
`If I had a sofa, I'd probably fall asleep." `
`"I see. `
`...Then I guess it's almost time for this party to end." `
`"......?" `
`...The party will end if I fall asleep? `
`But I just wanted to take a nap while everyone else kept having fun. `
`"Was our puzzle just now a hard one?" `
`"...Yeah. `
`I still don't really get it. `
`...And, ...I'm sleepy..." `
`"It's called posterior probability. `
`That's what we call it when the probability of something changes because we learn or fail to learn some piece of information." `
`"............" `
`Did George onii-chan call me all the way over here to lecture me on math...? `
`...For some reason, I feel even sleepier now. `
`"So, `
`if we have one almond in ten slices of cake, our chances of getting it are 10%. `
`...But what if "we learn" that those ten pieces were chosen at random from a hundred pieces?" `
`"You'd think that the probability went from 1 in 10 to 1 in 100, right...?" `
`"Absolutely nothing has changed about your slice of cake. `
`...Depending on whether you know or don't know a certain fact, `
`the probability of your slice being a winner changes. `
`Doesn't that sound strange?" `
`"...That sounds hard, so I don't wanna think about it..." `
`"Ange, `
`please, just listen until the end." `
`Jessica onee-chan's voice grew a bit stern. `
`As young as I was, ...I couldn't understand what all this was supposed to mean to me. `
`"There's only one thing I want to tell you. `
`So please, don't forget this." `
`"...What?" `
`"In the future, `
`various bits of information will affect the slice of cake in your hands. `
`...By learning about those, the insides of your slice might change. `
`Sometimes, they'll change into things you want. `
`...But, most likely, almost all of the changes will be bad ones." `
`"The truth is always right there in your hands, Ange. `
`...Don't you think it's stupid to let it change around just because you hear other people talking? Just because they think the truth should be one thing or another?" `
`"The truth inside of you has been in your hands since the beginning. `
`...The nature of that truth...is actually something you decide for yourself. `
`...You change it yourself depending on what you hear...and what you refuse to listen to." `
`"You probably don't get what we're saying. `
`But you have to understand. `
`Even if you can't understand when you're 6 years old, I'm sure you will once 12 years have passed." `
`"............" `
`With very serious expressions on their faces, they grasped my shoulders as they spoke. `
`...I don't know what they're trying to tell me. `
`"The truth that lies in your hands is not unchangeable. `
`You'll be interfered with in many ways that'll make it change. `
`...So, if the truth in your hands is really important to you..." `
`"You need to protect it yourself. `
`Don't forget it." `
`"............" `
`"Next is Onii-chan and {f:5:Beatrice}'s puzzles, and then I'm done." `
`"Ah, really? `
`Even though there were so many of us, it looks like it's finally over." `
`"How was it? `
`Did you enjoy tonight's party...?" `
`"Yeah. `
`It was fun. `
`But I think I'm a bit sleepy." `
`"...That's no surprise, `
`considering how much we've been running around." `
`I rubbed my eyes. `
`I must've gotten really excited. `
`But whenever I get excited, I'm always tired afterwards. `
`Right now, I'd rather have a sofa to lie on than medals. `
`"I've got a special puzzle just for you, ...but are you sure you want it? `
`If you're sleepy, you can stop now." `
`"No. `
`I've come this far, so I'll keep going... `
`......*yaaawn*..." `
`Onii-chan and Beato laughed at my yawn. `
`"Looks like it's time to call it a day..." `
`"Indeed. `
`Ange, `
`let us leave my puzzle for later. `
`It's too difficult to be solved by one with eyes as sleepy as that." `
`"......No way. `
`...I've...come this far, and... `
`...I also want...Onii-chan's medal......" `
`I'm just so...so sleepy... `
`............ `
`Ange drifted over to a chair in the corner of the room and plopped down onto it. `
`Then, she closed her eyes and sat there like a doll. `
`It didn't take long before the cute sound of her breathing in her sleep could be heard... `
`When she saw that Ange was finally asleep, Beato spoke softly. `
`"Quiet please, everyone. `
`...Ange fell asleep." `
`When she spoke, the peaceful clatter that filled the room fell silent. `
`Everyone looked down into Ange's sleeping face. `
`Each of them wore an affectionate gaze, as if they'd just watched a baby finally drift to sleep. `
`"...Did Ange-chan have a good time?" `
`"But of course. `
`...The feeling might not be so strong now, `
`but one day, she will surely remember tonight's party and understand how fun it was." `
`"...You're right." `
`"...It was fun for us too, getting to play with Ange-chan." `
`By this point, everyone was standing in a wide circle around Ange as she slept. `
`Now that the guest of honor was asleep, ...this Halloween party had reached its conclusion... `
`"So long, my granddaughter. `
`...I was so pleased to have this chance to play with you again after 12 years. `
`...It matters not if you forget everything about me. `
`Remember me as an arrogant despot. `
`...But, every now and then, just try and remember how much I adored you." `
`"She will remember. `
`...Ange-san, `
`you have a long life ahead of you. `
`Even after 12 years, there is still much for you to experience. `
`I pray that you find this life meaningful and worthwhile." `
`"...You are the final grandchild and daughter of the Ushiromiya family. `
`All of us pray for your happiness." `
`"Ange-chan, `
`stay well. `
`...Happiness isn't something you find, it's something you make. `
`And in fact, memories work the same way." `
`"True. `
`...There are some things that we only truly understand when we think back on them years later." `
`"Make sure you remember my pretty face every now and then. `
`Just havin' you remember us is the greatest memorial service we could ever have." `
`"Oh, come on. `
`It's not like we're dying. `
`We're just going to the inside of the cat box, ...the other side of the curtain." `
`"That's right. `
`It's not even a curtain. `
`It's just like we are now. `
`Ange-chan's there sleepin' away. `
`The rest of us are right by her side, watchin' over her. `
`We'll always be with her." `
`All of them still wore warm smiles, but the sound of sniffling came from several places throughout the room... `
`This party wasn't only for the girl who wasn't able to be here this day. `
`It was also for all those people who weren't able to meet her here, `
`...who never had the chance to say goodbye... `
`"Ange, `
`live life strongly. `
`...Our blood flows through your veins. `
`That'll definitely bring you strength." `
`"...Eva nee-san, `
`take care of our daughter. `
`...She's not honest with herself, and she'll often be selfish and short-tempered. `
`She might be a pain all the time, but..." `
`"I'll make sure...she finds happiness. `
`As long as she wants it herself..." `
`"Ange-sama, ...it's okay if you forget my face. `
`But please, at least remember the taste of my cooking...!" `
`"Hohhohohohohohohoho. `
`And I won't ask you to remember old Kumasawa. `
`But please, at least remember the taste of mackerel juice." `
`Someone said "When'd you feed her that?!" and everyone laughed wryly. `
`"Her face looks so cute, sleeping there like that. `
`...She looks like an angel, just like her name." `
`"She's not an angel, she's a witch. `
`Ange's the final witch, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}." `
`"I wonder if that magic will bring her happiness." `
`"Will she become a white witch or a black witch? `
`...That's for Ange to choose. `
`I've shown her both sides." `
`"I'm sure a painful life lies ahead for you. `
`You'll probably believe that you're all alone in this world. `
`...But we will always be there right behind you, cheering you on. `
`Don't forget that..." `
`"Ange, `
`...don't forget. `
`Your self, your happiness, your fate... `
`These are all things you create for yourself. `
`Only you can choose them. `
`No one else can give you them, and no one else can hide them from you. `
`...Don't forget that." `
`"I'm sure your message reached her." `
`"...I hope so." `
`"I'm certain the tale of the two of us will help Ange-sama understand." `
`"......Yeah." `
`"Don't you have anything to tell her, George-sama?" `
`"...I've already said all I wanted with that box puzzle." `
`"Will that puzzle teach her something?" `
`"I don't know. `
`But I do know that she's wise. `
`I'm sure she'll learn something from it." `
`"...Ange-sama, `
`I pray that you're guided along the right path as you move towards the future." `
`One by one, they stepped forward and said words of farewell to Ange. `
`Then, finally, Battler and Beato walked forward... `
`"Ange, `
`...were you able to remember everyone, at least a little bit?" `
`Of course, Ange didn't answer in her sleep. `
`But Battler continued. `
`"It's true that the Ushiromiyas are a strange family. `
`We're super-rich, and that's given rise to all sorts of rumors and stories. `
`...However, that's all speculation made by people outside the island." `
`"...No one will blame you for forgetting these kind memories, young as you were. `
`But even so, you must remember. `
`...It is not a sin to forget. `
`...But to not remember again...is a sin." `
`"All of us... `
`...were really happy to have you at this party. `
`Right, everyone?" `
`Everyone nodded at Battler's words. `
`Everyone knew about the merciless and lonely life that awaited her. `
`It was no longer possible for them to heal those wounds. `
`If there was one thing they could do... `
`...It was to make her remember what a kind, fun family she once had. `
`...To remind her that, both today and into the future, they would always care for her and watch over her. `
`"It goes without saying... `
`that this is an illusion. `
`You cannot come to Rokkenjima on October 4th, 1986. `
`This whole party we shared was all a magical illusion, created by the Game Master, Battler." `
`"But you've remembered, right...? `
`You've remembered the truth... `
`...about how kind everyone was, and how much of a blast we all had at the family conferences, right...?" `
`Ange breathed softly in her sleep. `
`Who knows...if those words truly reached her...? `
`"Aunt Eva." `
`"............" `
`"...Take care of her." `
`"Do you...really think...that I deserve to become her mother...?" `
`"I do. `
`...Even though your own sadness was so unbearable, `
`...you tried so hard to be a mother for Ange." `
`"But, in the end......" `
`"It's okay. `
`...Ange, listen carefully." `
`Battler grasped Ange's hand, then took Eva's hand and joined the two hands together... `
`"...We know that a tragic fate leads to a future where you two hurt each other. `
`...It's a sad thing for Ange...and just as sad for Aunt Eva. `
`...It would've been cruel to ask you to open your heart to her. `
`Likewise, it would've been cruel to ask Aunt Eva to keep on overcoming her sadness after being rejected." `
`"...Neither of you `
`is at fault." `
`"Even so, we have no right to tell you to forgive her. `
`...So, we won't. `
`...Just try and understand. `
`It doesn't matter how long it takes, how far into the future it happens. `
`Just try and understand Aunt Eva. `
`And, every once in a while, ......remember us." `
`"I concur. `
`And, every once in a while, remember this merry, cheerful, attractive paragon of a woman, and chant my name in praise three times every day." `
`The relatives smiled bitterly, apparently disagreeing with some of that last bit. `
`Eva softly stroked Ange's cheek and spoke one last time. `
`"...It's okay if you don't forgive your aunt. `
`...But... `
`it's true that I don't hate you. `
`...At least understand that..." `
`Eva wiped her eyes and slowly stood up. `
`Hideyoshi held her shoulder, and Rudolf and Kyrie gathered around her too. `
`"...Genji-san, `
`would you mind carrying Ange to somewhere she can lie down?" `
`"As you wish. `
`...Shall I take her to the guesthouse?" `
`"It would be a little too sad to leave her there all alone." `
`"You're right. `
`...Could you carry her to a sofa in the parlor? `
`That way, she'll be able to come back if she wakes up and feels like joining in again." `
`Genji gently lifted Ange up and carried her towards the parlor. `
`Everyone continued to watch over her as she left... `
`"Shannon, Kanon. `
`In the end, how many medals did Ange gather?" `
`"...She didn't get any medals." `
`"...She got 1 medal." `
`"...She got 2 medals." `
`"...She got 3 medals." `
`"...She got 4 medals." `
`"...She got 5 medals." `
`"...She got 6 medals." `
`"...She got 7 medals." `
`"...She got 8 medals." `
`"...She got 9 medals." `
`"...She got 10 medals." `
`"...She got 11 medals." `
`"...She got 12 medals." `
`"...She got 13 medals." `
`"...She got 14 medals." `
`"...She got 15 medals." `
`"...She got 16 medals." `
`"...She got 17 medals." `
`"Hmm, I see. `
`...Then place this by her pillow." `
`"Yes, `
`as you wish." `
`Genji carried Ange to the parlor and set her down on the sofa. `
`Shannon quietly laid a warm blanket on top of her. `
`Kanon placed a message card by her pillow, along with that thing Kinzo had handed them. `
`The message card read as follows: `
`{a:c:We'll all be with you, always. `
`{n}{nobreak:{m:-5:—}—}From the whole Ushiromiya family} `
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a scrubbing brush. `
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a can of mackerel. `
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a memory foam pillow with the One-winged Crest. `
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......an old‐type white school swimsuit. `
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a fully ripe mango. `
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a decorative pine branch. `
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a uniform from Angel Mort. `
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a signed celebrity photograph of Kinzo himself. `
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a bag that laughs with Kinzo's voice. `
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a One‐winged Eagle carp streamer. `
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a bouquet of golden roses. `
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a music box that was passed down through the generations. `
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a mass‐produced Sakutarou doll. `
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a tea set bearing the family crest. `
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a pocket watch bearing the family crest. `
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a {f:5:Beatrice} corsage. `
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a Battler doll. `
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a {f:5:Beatrice} doll. `
`Ange, mumbling in her sleep, held it tightly against her cheek. `
`"Let us go. `
`We mustn't wake her." `
`"Nee-san." `
`"...Yeah. `
`......?" `
`Shannon thought she saw something glittering silver near Ange's eye... `
`The servants left and closed the parlor door. `
`As Ange slept, she was wrapped up in the soft sound of the rain. `
`Surely, she was reliving that fun evening once more in her dreams... `
