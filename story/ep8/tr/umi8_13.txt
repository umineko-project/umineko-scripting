`The Book of the Single Truth, sealed in crystal by Battler.`
`Until I undo this seal, I can't even stick the key in the keyhole.`
`"......You can remove it, right?`
` This seal."`
`"Of course."`
`They were in a vast, dimly‐lit space.`
`To sum it up in a phrase, ......it was like a trench in the ocean floor.`
`No, that's not quite right.`
` It was......a library.`
`However, the number of books and the height of the shelves vastly surpassed all of those that existed in the world of humans.`
`If height is the measure of greatness,`
` ...then the gods must surely have been giants taller than mountains.`
`This place appeared to be a library big enough and grand enough for such gods.`
`Each individual book was no larger than those from the human world.`
`However, the shelves holding them stood like the walls of a valley......or a deep‐sea ocean trench.`
`So, ......Ange and the others looked like little more than a few small butterflies who had wandered into this vast library.`
`......Like minuscule deep‐sea fish swimming about all alone in an ocean pit.`
`"This is more like ice than a seal.`
` ......If you just steal it away from Battler and put it under the rays of the sun, it will fade away by itself as time passes."`
`"Isn't there some way to just smash it open?"`
`"......Do you like to thaw your frozen fish by smashing it with a hammer?"`
`"Sorry, I was always terrible in cooking class."`
`"......Kitties,`
` thaw this seal."`
`When {f:5:Bernkastel} whispered, from the dark ocean pit deep below them,`
` ......several emerald‐green glints appeared and gathered like a school of fish.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} threw the Book of the Single Truth down to them, and only after several seconds passed, the school of fish seemed to gather around it and carry it away.`
`Those few seconds made it clear just how deep this bookshelf trench went.`
`Ange was once again dumbfounded by this unimaginably vast and godly library...`
`"We can just let them handle the rest."`
`"......And you really will let me see what's inside?"`
`"If that is your wish, I'll grant it.`
` And, of course, I won't be able to read it myself without that key of yours."`
`Ange silently gripped the golden key in her pocket...`
`This journey has been so long, and so strange.`
`In search of the truth from twelve years ago, I left my home, ......met President Okonogi, met Amakusa...`
`......And, at some point, that adventure became part of a witch illusion.`
`However, here I am.`
`Ushiromiya Eva's diary is here.`
`The truth written inside it is sitting right before me.`
`"Rest for a while.`
` ......Even I don't have enough free time to spend it all with you."`
`".........Well, I'm not really tired though."`
`"Erika.`
` ......Serve Ange some tea or something."`
`"Yes, my master!"`
`Erika popped into existence out of nowhere and bowed to her master.`
`".........{f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` If, by any chance, you're planning to use me and steal both the key and the book, ......you won't get off easy."`
`"H‐how dare you say such a thing to my master?!"`
`"Sorry.`
` After my long experience with witches, I've decided not to trust normal words."`
`"......Very well.`
` I'll promise it with the red truth.`
` ......{p:1:When the seal on the Book of the Single Truth is dissolved, you, Ange, will be the first to read it}.`
` ......Is that good enough for you?"`
`For some time, Ange considered the witch's words, searching for some sort of trap hidden within them...`
`There was no greater guarantee than a red truth given by a witch.`
` Ange understood this well enough.`
`If one did start to doubt even this red truth, .........there would be nothing left to trust in this entire world.`
`If one began to suspect even this, ......then even the truth would no longer be truth.`
`"......Are you still unsatisfied about something?"`
`"Nn.........`
` ......No, I'm fine."`
`She would need {f:5:Bernkastel}'s help if she wanted to read the Book of the Single Truth.`
`Ange finally realized that she had nothing to gain by complaining more and annoying this witch further...`
`"......Once you've broken the seal, call me right away."`
`"Of course.`
` I also want to read it as soon as possible.`
` I'll call for you at once."`
`Bern spun away from them, then vanished into the dark bookshelf trench.`
`Ange saw a school of emerald‐green fish appear and follow behind {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` ......Could those be her familiars?`
`As she stared at the emerald lights that resembled some sort of deep‐sea fish, Ange was poked from behind.`
`"Let's go,`
` comrade Ange."`
`"......You're creeping me out, so please just call me Ange."`
`"Then you can call me Erika‐sama."`
`"......Let's get going, comrade Erika."`
`The pair began to swim in the direction Erika indicated.`
`"Swim" seemed a better way to describe what they were doing than "fly" would have.`
`".........Just what is this place?`
` It's way too big to be called a library."`
`"It's not like you'll be able to remember its name, so why not just call it the library?"`
`"I'll decide what I can or can't remember. Tell me."`
`"It's "the Great Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating's Noble City of Carefully Selected Books"."`
`"......Yeah, "the library" works fine."`
`"Knew you'd say that."`
`The City of Books.`
`Yeah, the name fits.`
`The bookshelves on either side of this canyon are skyscrapers.`
`If I think of those emerald‐green lights flowing beneath us as headlights on a highway, then this really does seem like a city of books.`
`"These things aren't just books, are they?"`
`"That's right.`
` Each volume is packed with an ensemble play.`
` ......They look like books from here, but if you open one up, you'll find a whole world inside."`
`".........So, even our long tale is only one of these."`
`"Great witches who live on a far, far higher plane than we do are hardly any different from a god or Creator.`
` ......From their perspective, our little tale is worth little more than a single book, if that."`
`From the theatergoer's perspective, our individual lives are hardly worth anything at all.`
`If they're writing down an entire world in a single volume, ......then my life probably isn't even worth a single line.`
`"But we're the main characters.`
` ......I am, and so are you."`
`"That's right.`
` Even if the tale of the gods doesn't mention us,`
` ......we are always the main character in the story we write for ourselves.`
` .........Becoming aware of that fact is the first thing that separates witches from {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s."`
`They were on a balcony, which was really a room‐sized section that had been dug out of the bookshelf, with no guardrail along the cliff.`
`It didn't go in very deep, making it look like a room that had been cut in half.`
`It was filled with the tools of everyday life, as though this was Erika's hidden house.`
`"My master has ordered me to serve you some tea,`
` so if you don't feel like drinking, I'll have to pour it into you with a funnel."`
`".........If you try, I'll have to serve you some matcha."`
`"Matcha?"`
`"......Nothing. Just talking to myself."`
`Ignoring Erika as she made tea, ......Ange looked down upon the bizarre, otherworldly scene below.`
`Until Erika finished getting the tea ready, the scene held Ange's gaze like it was sucking out her soul......`
`"This might sound strange, coming from me."`
`"......What?"`
`"You made a deal to throw away your life to learn the truth.`
` That's quite something."`
`".........I had nothing to gain from life.`
` It was easy for me to trade away the time I had left."`
`"My master really does take to idle whims.`
` To think she would make a contract for the meaningless life of a powerless girl."`
`"........................Heh."`
`Ange chuckled, not bothering to argue.`
`That was exactly right.`
`How incredible that {f:5:Bernkastel} would lend her power to a worthless life that was trying to throw itself away.`
`"Well, my master is the witch who controls miracles.`
` ......So, it makes sense that she'd appear even for a worthless girl like you."`
`"Good point.`
` .........Even if {f:5:Bernkastel} hadn't appeared, I would've still taken that step off the edge that day."`
`"............You really are a cheap woman, aren't you?"`
`"Well then, just how much are you worth?"`
`"Me?!`
` Hahaha, aha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha......"`
`The way Erika cackled was disturbing.`
`Still, Ange realized that this was her way of answering the question.`
`People don't become witches of their own choosing.`
`If they're capable of living, all people want to live their lives as {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.`
`......When something comes along to trip up that life, ......that's when the road to living as a witch opens.`
`Even Furudo Erika, who calls herself the Witch of Truth, must be like this.`
`The two Witches of Truth, sitting here drinking tea without even looking at each other, ......are exactly the same.`
`"I...like exposing the truth."`
`"I know that."`
`"I like exposing secrets, then watching those people turn pale as they wonder how I figured it out.`
` ......That's when I know I've reached the truth, and it's a moment of ecstasy."`
`"There's something seriously wrong with you."`
`"Well then, what does the truth mean to you?"`
`"................................."`
`Ange was about to give an immediate answer, but she bit down her words.`
`And once she did, not knowing the right way to respond, no further words came.`
`After all, to Ange, the truth itself was the goal.`
`At first, it was out of hatred.`
`Could Ushiromiya Eva, the sole survivor of Rokkenjima, be the culprit behind everything?`
`She hated Eva, but she had no proof that her aunt was the culprit, and of course, Eva never talked about what happened on that island.`
`......So, at first, in Ange's eyes, "the truth" meant proof that Eva was the culprit.`
`However, that feeling withered away with Eva's death.`
`Now that Eva was dead, even if Ange did find some kind of proof, ......it wouldn't mean anything.`
`So, eventually, the truth Ange wanted to find......became nothing more than the simple desire to know what happened on that island that day.`
`However, one thing was obvious.`
`Even if she did find out the truth, ......that wouldn't bring any of her family back to her.`
`"......It might not mean anything at all."`
`"You're going to expose the truth your beloved Onii‐chan is hiding, even though it's meaningless?`
` You're the one that's not making sense."`
`Erika laughed mockingly.`
`{n}Ange laughed too, as though she agreed.`
`"And so,`
` truth to me became my goal.`
` ......Maybe you could even call it my reason for living."`
`"So, once you do reach the truth, there won't be any point or purpose to you living anymore, right?"`
`"That's right.`
` So, I'll die.`
` ......Hasn't it been long enough?`
` I've already lived twelve years too long.`
` Don't I at least deserve to have a witch appear and grant my wish in my final moments?"`
`"............To put it simply,`
` you're just tired with life—does that sum it up?"`
`"Yeah.`
` So, my reason for living, my very existence, and everything else is meaningless.`
` ......That's why this goal of finding the Book of the Single Truth has put a little sparkle back into my life, now that it's nearly over.`
` ......At least on that score, I'm grateful to {f:5:Bernkastel}."`
`"I see.`
` ......Battler wants you to live, so he hid the goal that would let you die.`
` ......I think I pity Battler‐san for the first time.`
` After all, you can't choose your little sister."`
`".........................................."`
`Sorry, Onii‐chan.`
`I'm...tired of life.`
`Twelve whole years.`
`I've been living off nothing but the illusion that someone might come home someday.`
`Just let me find peace already.`
`Finding the truth of that day...... I decided I'd use that to mark the end of my life.`
`For twelve years, I've believed in a miracle, but there was no miracle...`
`I won't......believe in miracles anymore.........`
`"......The Book of the Single Truth.`
` Of course, I'm also dying to find out what's in it,`
` but from what I hear, it doesn't sound like the truth inside is something spectacular enough to mark the end of your life with."`
`"Yeah.`
` .........At first, I hoped there would be something earth‐shattering written in it.`
` But now......I guess I've cooled on it."`
`"Any truth searched for by a worthless person is bound to be worthless.`
` It'll probably make for a fitting end to your worthless life."`
`".........Yeah.`
` I'm...sure it will."`
`Ange was already starting to realize something.`
`Regardless of why Eva decided not to talk about what happened...`
`......the real events of that day.........probably weren't anything earth‐shattering.`
`Some sort of malfunction made the bomb in that secret underground base explode.`
`Yes.`
` ......It was just...an accident.`
`But......the public believed, and hoped, that some sort of plot surrounded the events of that day.`
`Eva was a suspect herself, so she could claim that nothing strange had happened until she was blue in the face, and no one would believe her.`
`......Of course, this included Ange.`
`In that case, ......shutting up like a clam would just make things easier.`
`It was hardly surprising......that Eva chose to say nothing.`
`"......Right now, I don't feel any sense of accomplishment.`
` ......I just feel...sort of worn out and listless."`
`"Being able to bear the truth is what makes a witch a Witch of Truth.`
` .........Comrade Ange.`
` It looks like you don't possess that strength after all.`
` If you did, you wouldn't be thinking about dying."`
`"...........................`
` ......You're right.`
` ......For twelve years, I've clung on to the hope that someone might come back.`
` ......I've just used {f:5:Beatrice}'s cat box to shut away the truth, denying it for twelve years."`
`"......When you read the Book of the Single Truth,`
` I wonder what will happen to you."`
`"Who knows.`
` .........Won't {f:5:Bernkastel} carry out the contract by slicing my head off with a scythe or something?`
` Or will I be turned into chunks of meat again?`
` ......Maybe I'll get some salt and pepper this time."`
`"..............................`
` ......I see, so that's where the chunks of meat thing came from."`
`"Did you say something?"`
`"Nope, nothing at all.`
` Anyway, would you like some more tea?"`
`"No thank you."`
`Ange listlessly gazed down from the balcony with no handrail,`
` ......down into the darkness of the abyss at the bottom of the bookshelf ravine... no, the gap between the bookshelf skyscrapers.`
`......From the beginning until the end of my journey, .........I haven't taken a single step away from this spot.`
`This journey of mine, not even a single step long, ......will end soon.........`
`"......Um, what are those lines of lights flowing around at the bottom?"`
`"Oh, those?`
` Probably a group of guests coming to the great Lady {f:5:Aurora}'s party."`
`"Guests...?"`
`"Great Witches from the Senate, Voyager witches who are trying to escape boredom in their endless travels,`
` powerful witches who have woken from century‐long sleeps, as well as witches who control the future world and noble witch hunters.`
` It seems she's planning to hold a grand party tonight."`
`"......Is it a birthday party or something?"`
`"From what I've heard, while the great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}, the Endless Witch, may be an outsider among witches,`
` she's also the genius whose formidable magical system of magic resulted in the creation of "{f:5:Beatrice}'s cat box", the endless factory capable of producing endless tales.`
` ......From my point of view, she's just stupid and a weak finisher, but in the world of great witches, she's apparently pretty famous."`
`"So this is {f:5:Beatrice}'s birthday party?"`
`"My master says she'll be holding a dinner party with {f:5:Beatrice}'s guts.`
` ......After all, it's only natural, right?`
` The cat box was only able to generate infinite tales because there was no Single Truth."`
`".........However, tonight,`
` the Single Truth will be revealed, thanks to your key.`
` And that means the cat box will be opened.`
` Really, it's no different from slicing open her chest as she still lives and tearing out what's inside."`
`".........Everyone in that huge crowd which looks like a packed freeway is going to one dinner party?`
` .........I'm not sure what's stronger, my shock at how famous {f:5:Beatrice} is, or my revulsion at those sleaze‐bags."`
`"For you, the Book of the Single Truth is nothing more than an end.`
` .........However, for all of those enjoying the mystery of Rokkenjima, this is an event that can't be missed."`
`"I see.`
` .........So, that's a crowd of those goats who're chewing Onii‐chan's game board apart."`
`Ange's analogy was an accurate one.`
`The crowd far, far below them......was made up of nobles wearing beautiful outfits and goat masks.`
`They were all so intent on tearing the guts out of {f:5:Beatrice}'s cat box that they couldn't even hide the drool trickling from their mouths.`
`Those gluttonous goat nobles, who derived pleasure from violently exposing the truth, were in a line of cars heading towards the meeting place.`
`".........Looks like this is the end for {f:5:Beatrice} and the cat box."`
`"......Beato's group has holed up in the Golden Land, the last leftovers from the game board.`
` Acting as gatekeepers, Battler and Beato have destroyed the first wave, but they won't be able to stop the second.`
` ......My master has given me an armada capable of destroying the very concept of defensive measures.`
` The Golden Land's ramparts are as good as gone."`
`".........Those goats who appeared all over the island... They're the personification of random opinions in the future, and all of them want the island's tale to be a tragedy."`
`"That's right.`
` Those goats keep getting born from the sea of the internet.`
` That first wave was just the riffraff.`
` The second wave will be entirely different.`
` It's made up of the best of the best, elite goats selected from the crowd that are capable of denying all the cowering pieces one by one.`
` In total, they number in the hundreds of thousands.`
` ......A hundred thousand people to deny the existence of a few dozen hiding on an island."`
`"......Looks like......this is it for Onii‐chan too."`
`"You're ready, though, aren't you?`
` You understand that Ushiromiya Battler died in 1986, ......and that this man is an illusion created by the cat box."`
`"............Yeah.`
` ......I understand."`
`Regardless of whether he's my real brother or an illusion, ......regardless of whether he's who I'd like him to be or not,`
` ......the Battler who created this game board for my sake...will die.`
`No, it just means that I'll accept the fact of his death, so it's not like he's going to die now......`
`Ange thought to herself.`
`Shouldn't performing the last rites for her brother......be her responsibility?`
`This was her final trial, which she had assigned to herself.`
`All of those people down on the game board......were the personification of Ange's naivety.`
`By denying the existence of all of them, .........wouldn't she finally be able to accept the truth?`
`.................................`
`No, that's not right.`
` ......I'm not being honest, even with myself.`
`Even if it's all an illusion, .........it wouldn't make that bizarre Halloween party any less heartwarming.`
`......Onii‐chan said it himself.`
`That Halloween party may have been an illusion.`
`However...`
`{n}He was trying to use that party to tell me something.........`
`........................`
`"About that second wave......"`
`"My master has appointed me to be their commander.`
` ......Leave it to me, Ange‐san.`
` My master isn't so malicious that she'd make you dirty your own hands."`
`".............................."`
`Yes, that might be kind of her.`
`.........These are...my lingering attachments we're talking about.`
`I should be grateful to {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`If she really were cruel,`
` she would probably have ordered me to take charge of the second wave and execute my own family.`
`"Comrade Ange.`
` You are a Witch of Truth, aren't you?"`
`".....................`
` ......That's right.`
` ......Probably."`
`"Then let's accept the truth, okay?`
` Finally, after twelve years, the Single Truth lies before you."`
`".....................`
` ......I'll just sit around here until {f:5:Bernkastel} finishes breaking the seal."`
`"You'll probably be summoned as a guest for the party.`
` ......We've got a mirror, so maybe you should wipe the sleep from your eyes."`
`"And maybe you should shave before heading out to battle."`
`It floated in the empty air.`
`{n}...The door to the Golden Land.`
`One or two square meters of tiled floor still remained in front of the door, scarcely enough to remind a person that this had once been Kinzo's study.`
`......By now, all of the game board except the Golden Land had been eaten away, leaving only this door floating in a sea of nothingness......`
`There were two figures in front of that door.`
`It was Battler......and Beato.`
`They may not have been literally covered with wounds, but they definitely seemed to be dead tired.`
`Battler, leaning against the door, seemed to have finally caught his breath.`
`Beato was also sitting against the door, letting her legs dangle gracelessly.`
`Could the battle against that force really be called a battle?`
`It was more like a mere pushing fight on the increasingly small bit of ground that remained.`
`......They had wanted to protect at least Kinzo's study no matter what.`
`And, the only fruit of their desperate struggle was the tiny bit of flooring that they were sitting on now.`
`Those goats fell into the abyss whenever they had nowhere to stand.`
`So now, with so much of the floor gone, there was no way for them to attack anymore.`
`If Battler thought this, his naive hopes were quickly crushed.`
`".........Looks like we're surrounded."`
`"So, their plan was to gather their forces and crush us in a single stroke..."`
`Stretching across the horizon surrounding the door at their backs...`
`......was an encirclement of countless large sailing ships.`
`As they could clearly see, the decks of those ships were packed with goats,`
` with some of the more foolish and overeager ones spilling over the edges into the emptiness below.`
`"Dang...`
` I've gone through a lot of crazy stuff in your games,`
` ......but being surrounded by pirate ships is definitely a first for me."`
`"......They probably do possess the strength to break through the Golden Land's perimeter.`
` Those cannons are no bluff.`
` Doubtless, they intend to use those to smash through this door and pour in."`
`Along the sides of each ship were several open gun ports, each with a cannon pointing at the door.`
`If all the ships surrounding them were joined by even more, and all of those ships fired all of their cannons at once...`
`......There was no point trying to imagine what would happen next.`
`Battler and Beato grimaced and hung their heads.`
`"......How long will the Golden Land perimeter hold out against those cannons?"`
`"I do not know.`
` ......However, since they are still awaiting reinforcements after amassing that many, ......I doubt the barrier will break that easily."`
`"True.`
` I can't think of any other reason to delay your attack without even sending terms for surrender..."`
`"I hope we can take advantage of this time they give us."`
`"......Time is always the ally of the weaker side.`
` After all, we can always hope for a miracle."`
`"Though it might also give us more time to wither in despair."`
`At that moment, something small and hard hit Battler in the forehead.`
`"......Ow!`
` The heck is this? Konpeitou candy...?!"`
`"It's me!`
` I know where Bern and the others are!"`
`The konpeitou candy was {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s transformed body.`
`She was the only one of their allies capable of crossing the sea of fragments.`
`"Spectacular!`
` That's the great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} for you!"`
`"They'll be able to see us here.`
` Let's talk inside.`
` ......It's getting crazy out there."`
`"Got it.`
` ......Is anyone there?!"`
`"When Battler knocked on the door, it opened, and Shannon and Kanon came into view.`
`"You called for us?"`
`"My apologies, but we need you two to keep a lookout."`
`"Leave it to us."`
`"......When they begin their attack, don't worry about fighting them.`
` Escape to the Golden Land as soon as they start.`
` Don't worry about closing the door."`
`"But that means......"`
`"They're planning to ignore the door and smash the Golden Land directly.`
` Making a last stand here won't do anyone any good."`
`"......I understand."`
`"We'll take care of things here, so go inside and work on a counterattack."`
`"Indeed.`
` We're counting on you."`
`Battler and Beato traded places with Shannon and Kanon, returning to the Golden Land.`
`A gentle rain poured down over the Golden Land rose garden.`
`{n}......The Golden Land's weather reflected the hearts of those inside it.`
`The quietly falling raindrops spoke for the pain felt by those who could do nothing but hide here, waiting for the enemy's final assault......`
`When they returned to the arbor, the konpeitou flew out of Battler's pocket,`
` jumped onto the table, and returned to its original form.`
`"I haven't had a thrill like this for years!`
` Hard to believe I'd get put in a tight spot like this even after becoming a witch."`
`"Let's get down to business...!`
` Just where are Ange and {f:5:Bernkastel}...?!"`
`"The City of Books."`
`"......I have heard of it.`
` ......They say it's a place where all kinds of fragments, collected by great witches who travel the sea, are recorded and stored in the form of books."`
`"Indeed, the Great Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating's Noble City of Carefully Selected Books."`
`"So, the great Lady {f:5:Aurora} is the ruler of the City of Books.`
` Truly a suitable place for her."`
`"Nice going, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` ......Hard to believe you could pick out that spot so quickly from all the other possible hiding places."`
`"Actually, it was pretty easy.`
` ......I didn't even have to search, since they're advertising it as loud as they can.`
` They're planning a huge party where they'll unveil the secret to the cat box of the Endless Witch, the great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`".........Hmph.`
` I see, so they haven't been delaying their attack because they await reinforcements, but because the party hasn't begun yet."`
`"So, in this party, they plan to use Ange's key and reveal the contents of the Book of the Single Truth?"`
`"You've got it.`
` {f:5:Aurora} hasn't held an event like this for ages, and she's gathering VIP guests from all over the place.`
` ......The Book of the Single Truth will probably be the party's final showpiece."`
`"......So that means we still have a shot at taking Ange and the key back."`
`"Time‐wise, that may be true.`
` However, there's a really simple and obvious problem."`
`"What?"`
`"The City of Books is a sacred realm under the supervision of the Senate.`
` It's protected by a holy barrier.`
` Only a witch of the Senate can enter it."`
`"......Aren't there any invitees who aren't members of the Senate?"`
`"Yeah, there are.`
` It looks like they're being given special "invitations", which allow them to enter the sacred realm for a limited time.`
`"......Invitations."`
`"My, my, ......now this might be interesting."`
`"That's what I thought too...!`
` But it turns out there's a strict policy on punctuality, and these invitations automatically become useless unless you present them before the party begins!`
` And, I'm afraid to say the party started a short while ago."`
`"In other words, it's too late to try stealing an invitation from a guest who's running late."`
`"That's right.`
` ......So, what do we do now?!`
` Could someone get me popcorn?`
` I'd like a nice candy flavor this time!"`
`"As an outsider, I hate to barge into the conversation, ......but we seem to have no options left."`
`".........We're already done for, aren't we..."`
`"Can't we do anything except sit here until they attack?!`
` There must be something we can do...!"`
`"That's right.`
` ......There is just one thing we can do."`
`".........What's that?"`
`"We can keep on strugglin' for each second of survival...and hope for a miracle."`
`"A miracle...?!"`
`"So, we're stuck defending the Alamo."`
`"We cannot surrender.`
` ......Our only option is to hold out as long as we can, waiting for a miracle."`
`"......Uryuu.`
` What kind of miracle?"`
`"Ange could change her mind...for some reason.`
` ......There is a chance, maybe one in several million, that she comes back."`
`"......Hmph.`
` With a probability such as that, it truly would be a miracle."`
`"We are here so that we can await Ange‐san's return."`
`"Yes.`
` ......Ange‐san has nowhere to call home except where we are right now.`
` So, we must defend this place to the last minute, waiting for her to come back."`
`"Awaiting the master's return is the duty of a servant...!`
` N‐n‐n‐now that it has come to this, I, Gohda, am prepared for what may come...!"`
`".........Battler‐sama.`
` All of us are prepared."`
`"We of the Chiester Sisters Imperial Guard will fulfill our oath and remain by the great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}'s side until the bitter end!"`
`"45 here, no problems!`
` I shall fight until the end."`
`"......Finally, a fitting place to die nyeh.`
` ......No problems from 410 nyeh."`
`"The Seven Sisters of Purgatory will stay with {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama and Battler‐sama until the finish!!"`
`The six younger sisters also showed their resolve with their eyes.`
`"Eiserne Jungfrau...`
`will serve until the {f:5:end}."`
`"The former SSVD's got your back too."`
`".........And please, lend us your power as well."`
`"Me?!`
` No way.`
` Didn't I just give you some excellent intel?`
` I think I've done more than my fair share, don't you?"`
`"How do you know that Ange‐chan is in the City of Books?"`
`"I saw her with my own eyes, of course.`
` I never trust anything unless I see it for myself."`
`"Which means you're qualified to enter this sacred realm called the City of Books, right?"`
`"............Indeed.`
` The great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} is a witch of the Senate, after all."`
`"{f:5:Lambdadelta}......"`
`"......What's with you guys?`
` .........You aren't gonna tell me to do more work, are you...?"`
`"My, what an unexpected development...!"`
`"Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} is the only one who can enter the City of Books!"`
`"And could that possibly mean...?!"`
`""That this is Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s time to shine?!!""`
`"Enough kidding around! Are you people crazy?`
` ......You're telling me to go, all by myself,`
` and sneak into there one more time,`
` and then bring Ange back out here?!"`
`The several dozen people surrounding {f:5:Lambdadelta} all nodded in unison.`
`"How stupid can you be?!`
` If I were to save Ange, that'd mean crashing the great {f:5:Aurora}'s party, get it?!`
` I'd have the whole world as my enemy!"`
`"And what's in it for me?! Nothing, obviously!`
` There's nothing you all could possibly offer me...`
`that'd be worth getting on the bad side of {f:5:Aurora} and her monster friends...!"`
`"You'll get to see a happy ending, where {f:5:Aurora} and {f:5:Bernkastel}'s schemes are crushed,`
` Ange comes back, and everyone makes peace with one another."`
`"......What do you say, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}?`
` There could be no greater thrill.`
` ......If you pulled off such a marvelous feat, you would be able to forget your illness for a thousand years, would you not?"`
`"We're begging you, {f:5:Lambdadelta}...!!`
` Lend us your power!!"`
`Please, please, we're begging you!`
` Help us save Ange...!`
` Everyone clamored for {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s help.`
`They surrounded her and begged for her assistance.`
`"Please, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}...!!`
` Only you can do this...!!"`
`"Give us your strength!!`
` I'll show you the greatest of tales!!`
` You'll get to see it from the front row!!`
` So please, lend us your strength!!"`
`"Shut uuu{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}up!!`
` Shut the hell uu{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}up!!!"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} leapt to her feet and crushed the cup of popcorn in her hands.`
`Sweet, candy‐flavored popcorn flew everywhere and pieces stuck to everyone's face.`
`It may have been a hilarious sight.`
`......However, no one laughed.`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta}'s face was filled with a rage that none of them had seen before.`
`"Could you please stop getting the wrong idea?!`
` I'm a spectator! A spectator!!`
` I'm just a guest who was invited by Beato to come and watch this game!"`
`"So, why I am supposed to risk my life for you people?!`
` You think you'll get a happy ending if Ange comes back?!`
` Are you really that stupid?!`
` Bern and her forces will come sweeping through here, mad with rage, and wipe us all out!"`
`"There's only one reason I'm here,`
` and that's because Lion over there said I'd get to watch an interesting show!!"`
`"Yeah, and now I'm sure I'll get to see a sublimely interesting tale very soon...!`
` A sad, sad tragedy as you fight desperately against Bern's forces and get wiped out one by one!`
` Oh, I'm sure you'll each get one last time to shine as you're torn apart!"`
`"If I just wait a little, I'll get to see all that, won't I?`
` Pretty soon, all of you'll be dead!!`
` But not me!`
` I'm a spectator, a guest!!`
` There's absolutely no reason why I should agree to die with you!!!"`
`.........No one was able to say a word.`
`In the still silence, with no sound except that of the rain, ......even {f:5:Lambdadelta} finally hung her head in dismay.`
`".........Sorry.`
` I'm totally lame, aren't I?`
` ......Yeah, if I stood up right now and said "leave it to me", my popularity would surge and I'd probably make it into the top three in the next character popularity contest."`
`"............But still,`
` ......unlike the rest of you, ......I'm not "one of this story's characters".`
` ......I can't die.`
` ......It's like it's midnight, and you're telling me that we're almost at the best part.`
` But tomorrow's Monday, and I've got early cleaning duty at school...!`
` We live in completely different worlds...!!`
` That's why...... You can't, like......`
` ........................haaaah..............."`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} staggered as though dizzy, ......then plopped down into a chair.`
`Then, she became expressionless like a doll, just staring at a single point in space, silently......`
`".........Sorry."`
`Battler softly apologized.`
`{n}However, {f:5:Lambdadelta} remained expressionless.`
`"......There's still more we can do on our own.`
` So it's not fair to put pressure on you alone to risk something."`
`"...................................."`
`"We'll fight here and defend this spot until the last moment.`
` .........We'll believe in the miracle of Ange choosing us over the Single Truth.`
` ......If we aren't prepared to do that, we're in no position to ask you to give up your life alongside us."`
`Battler rose from his seat and spun around.`
`"......Battler..."`
`"I'll switch places with the pair outside.`
` ......When they come, I want to be in the front lines.`
` That's the fastest and most direct way I can show {f:5:Lambdadelta} my determination."`
`"................................."`
`"I shall go as well.`
` Master, please find Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} some more popcorn."`
`"......Beato..."`
`"I know Ange will return.`
` If we don't believe, even a possible miracle will not bear fruit.`
` You can't win a lottery unless you buy a ticket."`
`Beato also stood up and followed Battler.`
`"......Everyone,`
` let's do what we can to prepare for the fight."`
`"I agree.`
` Nothing stupider than just sitting around here...!"`
`"Good point.`
` If we're reaching the end, let's put on a good show."`
`".........We've got to make sure there's a place Ange‐chan can call home."`
`"And we should hold a strategic {f:5:conference}."`
`"Yeah.`
` We have furniture, weapons, demons, and Inquisitors.`
` Must be some way for these mismatched forces to cooperate."`
`"Let's go, little sisters.`
` Break time is over."`
`"Chiester Troops, rise."`
`The {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s and the fantasy creatures all rose to their feet and left the arbor.`
`Afterwards, only {f:5:Lambdadelta} remained, still staring blankly at a point in empty space......`
`"That black tea smells nice.`
` Is it instant? Or from a tea bag?"`
`"......Oh, would you like some too, comrade {f:5:Eva}?`
` We have no more cups, so you'll have to use a funnel."`
`A gold butterfly drifted onto the balcony and turned into {f:5:Eva}.`
`"How's {f:5:Bernkastel} doing?`
` Will it be a while longer before she breaks the seal on the Book of the Single Truth...?"`
`"That's what I came to talk about.`
` She says the seal has been broken."`
`".............................."`
`"Congratulations. So, the time has finally come.`
` ......The period to mark the end of your life."`
`"Take the key and go to Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` ......One of her cat familiars will guide you."`
`Two emerald sparkles flew in.`
`{n}They were the green, glinting eyes of a black cat.`
`The cat flicked its tail elegantly, with the dignity of a high‐class attendant.`
`"......Got it.`
` Then, I'll be back in a bit."`
`Ange rose from her seat.`
`She did it casually, as though she really was just heading out for a short trip.`
`However, her lips would never touch her half‐finished cup of tea again...`
`"We weren't together long, but I enjoyed it.`
` It was a very enlightening experience, to learn what disgust for your own kind feels like."`
`"Same here.`
` ......Next time we meet, you'll have to teach me the trick to making tea this terrible."`
`"......Are you happy?`
` Now, you'll finally get to learn that secret I've been hiding from you these past twelve years."`
`"I am happy.`
` ......Yeah, now I can understand how Erika feels.`
` ......It feels like I've taken a shot back at you, exposing the secret that you kept until your death."`
`"And is that a good feeling?"`
`".........Well, it's better than nothing."`
`Ange nodded towards the black cat to let it know that she was ready.`
`The cat nodded back in a refined manner, indicated that it wanted Ange to follow, and leapt from the balcony.`
`Without turning back, Ange followed it, jumping out into the air as though swimming...`
`{f:5:Eva} watched her go.`
`An expression of ridicule and scorn...was not the one that crossed her face...`
`"Good luck, Ange.`
` .........This is the path you've chosen.`
` ......You aren't six years old anymore.`
` You're eighteen.`
` ......Choose how to live your own life."`
`"...............What an overprotective aunt you are."`
`"I'm going to watch the ceremony.`
` What about you?"`
`"It's almost time to begin the attack, so I'm heading for the ships.`
` ......I've got to go pick up Beato's corpse.`
` The guts will go to the party.`
` I get to keep her skin, so let's stuff and mount it."`
`"So, this is the end to the mysterious tale of Rokkenjima."`
`".........Which means that it's also the end for you. I mean, you are a piece from there, right?"`
`"A piece is all I am.`
` The role of a piece is to remain faithful to its role until the game ends.`
` ......It's not a piece's place to worry about what happens after the game is over."`
`"True.`
` ......And it's the same for me.`
` .........Let's both enjoy this time while we have it.`
` Well then, allow me to take my leave."`
`"Later. Good luck with your work."`
`After exchanging elegant bows, the two witches vanished at the same time.`
`Nothing remained except some half‐finished tea cups and the aroma of the tea itself......`
`One after another, luxury cars stopped in front of a high‐class hotel in the city, and guests began to step out of them.`
`"Hey, Professor Ootsuki...!"`
`"Oh, what a surprise!`
` I haven't seen you since the last convention!"`
`All of the guests gathered here were very rich and cultured.`
`A single hobby tied all of them together.`
`They were the Witch Hunters.`
`Like‐minded people who enjoyed exploring various interpretations of the Rokkenjima mystery.`
`"Still, I wonder if it's really true.`
` It's hard to believe that Ushiromiya Eva's diary actually exists...!"`
`"It really is. I had heard rumors of it myself.`
` A secret diary said to have been hidden away by Ushiromiya Eva just before her death...!`
` Rumor has it that she wrote the details of Rokkenjima's truth in there.`
` It reminds me of that fable of the king with the donkey's ears.`
` Humans truly are tragic creatures, incapable of keeping quiet about a secret even if no one else could possibly learn of it."`
`"Waha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha.`
` From what I've heard, a collector from Dubai offered to buy it for ten million dollars...!"`
`"Incredible...!`
` More evidence of the fascination that the Rokkenjima mystery is capable of stirring!"`
`Conversations like this were breaking out passionately all over the place.`
`Furthermore, the guests weren't the only ones pouring in.`
`{n}The press was also there in force.`
`The Rokkenjima mystery had created such a large movement that, at one time, it became a social phenomenon.`
`Though that had died down slightly in recent years, it was still a topic fiercely debated across the internet.`
`It was hardly any surprise that the discovery and imminent release of Ushiromiya Eva's diary, which contained the truth of that mystery, had caused an uproar.`
`And on top of all that, the mysterious Forger Itouikukuro was to appear publicly for the first time.`
` In fact, it seemed that Itouikukuro and Hachijo Tohya, the up‐and‐coming mystery novelist, were the same person.`
`Of course, this meant that Hachijo Tohya would also be appearing in public for the first time.`
`The fact that she was actually an enigmatic female author, despite having been thought to be male, would have been enough to cause a stir on its own.`
`Before the diary unveiling party, a press conference was held in one of the rooms of the hotel.`
`"......Indeed.`
` I am Hachijo Tohya."`
`"We now know that in your previous book signings, you went to the lengths of using a double to avoid appearing in public.`
` What has caused you to change your mind and appear before us this time...?!"`
`"The legend of the Rokkenjima witch has given birth to endless tales.`
` ......Considering the weight of such a legend's demise,`
` and being the mere writer that I am, I felt obligated to show myself as a sign of respect."`
`"As a Forger, you announced on the web that you had reached the truth!`
` Does that mean you have already read the contents of that diary?!"`
`".........And, very soon, those contents will be revealed to everyone."`
`"Pardon me for asking,`
` but is there solid proof that the contents of this diary are the truth?`
` It seems that some are claiming it to be no more than the personal account of a single deceased person."`
`"That is not the case.`
` I guarantee it.`
` {p:1:The truth is written in this diary}."`
`A stir passed through the crowd, and the room was suddenly filled with camera flashes.`
`"This ends Hachijo's interview...!`
` Allow us to express our deep gratitude to all members of the press for coming today!`
` And now we would like to move on and allow you to take photos of Madam Ushiromiya Eva's diary."`
`A hotel worker pushed forward a cart covered by a veil.`
`Then, after looking to Hachijo for approval, he removed the veil.`
`There lay.........Ushiromiya Eva's diary.`
`{n}The Book of the Single Truth sat there, waiting for its seal to be broken.`
`Hachijo held it to her chest and laughed enigmatically.`
`Camera flashes came from everywhere, making the Book of the Single Truth glint......`
`"And that is all for now!`
` If you would all please move to the assembly hall...!"`
`Still holding the diary, Hachijo left the press conference room, escorted by men from the hotel.`
`Until she went through a door that said "No Entry Unless Authorized",`
` the journalists continued to surround her and ask questions, hoping to gather just one more comment.`
`When the door slammed shut, .........the world twisted.`
`The hotel employees became black cats wearing capes.`
`Hachijo had turned into {f:5:Featherine}...`
`"Things are getting pretty crazy out there.`
` ......Did you enjoy it?"`
`"......It was tiring.`
` ......Though not a bad experience.`
` I must say, though, this diary truly is heavy."`
`{f:5:Featherine} tossed the diary, and {f:5:Bernkastel} caught it.`
`"I will rest in one of the waiting rooms."`
`"You're up again pretty soon.`
` There's no time to rest."`
`"......In that case, call it a short break so that I can properly enjoy this long‐awaited excitement."`
`"I need to borrow that book.`
` I promised Ange that I'd show her first."`
`"I see.`
` In that case, do as you please."`
`{f:5:Featherine} left, followed by her cat attendants.`
`After watching her until she was out of sight, {f:5:Bernkastel} disappeared as well.`
`Like Erika's room, {f:5:Bernkastel}'s was a balcony without a handrail, dug out of a bookshelf cliff.`
`Ange had been kept waiting for some time, but she had waited patiently, looking down at the world below her...`
`{a:c:`
`"......I'm late, aren't I?`
` Sorry about that."}`
`After {f:5:Bernkastel} appeared, the black cats gave a bow and vanished.`
`"Here you go.`
` I've brought it with me.`
` The Book of the Single Truth."`
`".....................`
` ......Can I touch it...?"`
`"Do as you like."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} set it on the table and beckoned Ange forward.`
`Slowly, ......Ange approached it.`
`"So, ......this is Aunt Eva's diary......"`
`"That's right.`
` ......Inside it, you'll find the Single Truth that you wanted.`
` ......You do have the key, right?"`
`"Yes.`
` Right here."`
`Ange took the key out, looked at it there on her palm, then gripped it tightly.`
`Even that heavy lock that held the diary so securely...was fated to be swept aside easily as soon as Ange readied herself...`
`"I won't rush you.`
` You don't have to open it until you're ready."`
`"......In here, there's the truth of what happened on October 4th and 5th, 1986, right?"`
`"...............Yes.`
` Everything that you offered up your life in the hope of learning is there."`
`In that instant, inside of Ange, two Anges appeared, taking control of her body at the same time.`
`On the one hand, she knew that she had already paid a great price to learn the truth.`
`This part of her gripped the key, wanting to act quickly to prevent the moment of hesitation that might lead her to refuse to learn the truth now,`
` at the final moment, with the Book of the Single Truth right before her.`
`On the other hand,`
` ......a feeling that she was betraying the brother and family that watched over her warmly made her bite her lower lip.`
`However, though she shook, she could do nothing but watch as her right hand slowly brought the key towards the lock.`
`"................................."`
`"......................................."`
`What am I hesitating for...?`
`Inside this diary, there's the final destination of my sad, painful, twelve‐year‐long journey.`
`Was twelve years not enough of that? Do I want to keep living that way...?`
`That Onii‐chan, and all those others—those are all illusions created by my heart.`
` ......My naive hope that a miracle might still occur.`
`If I put my two options on a scale, then the path I should choose is clear.`
`Slowly, ......I pushed the key into the lock.........and twisted...`
`The lock opened with a click, ......and at the same time, it felt as though a crack ran through the key in my hands.`
`Maybe a part of its intricate design had broken off.`
`{n}I couldn't tell where it had broken just by glancing at it.`
`However, for some reason, its golden glint seemed dulled somehow.`
`"......It's because you've made your choice with that key.`
` A bit of magic has disappeared."`
`"What kind of magic?"`
`"Didn't Battler tell you?`
` He said you couldn't hand that over to anyone else.`
` ......That magic, which "left the decision to you", has just fulfilled its role and disappeared.`
` That key is just a key now.`
` It can't do anything but lock and unlock that diary."`
`".........I see.`
` Then, I guess I have no more use for Onii‐chan's key."`
`"Can I have it?`
` Once you've read the diary, I'll lock it up again.`
` Opening that lock will be a big part of tonight's ceremony, it seems."`
`"......I see.`
` Do whatever you want."`
`I don't give a damn what happens after I find the truth.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} slid the key from where it lay on the table and put it into her pocket.`
`"Go ahead, then.`
` .........Before the courage that led you here fades."`
`"................................."`
`I lifted up Aunt Eva's now unlocked diary.`
`The lock was open.`
` Even the hinge had been released by now.`
`......There was no longer anything standing in the way of me opening to the pages within...`
`I thought of taking a deep breath.`
` However, I decided against it.`
`......I prepared myself for this long ago.`
`So stupid to fuel my reluctance further.`
`I opened it.`
` Violently, ruthlessly.`
`I knew...that this was the right way to open to the truth that awaited me inside.`
`As soon as the cover was opened, ......a brilliant light poured out, and my mind went hazy.`
`The truth was sent to my mind directly, without letters or words......`
`Tell me......what happened that day............on Rokkenjima......`
`My consciousness......returned gradually.`
`Nothing was written in the open book before me.`
`Of course.`
` This was......my own blank and empty notebook.`
`I was at school, just sitting idly with my notebook open.`
`The world had stopped.`
`The hands on the clock had stopped too.`
`In that case, the auditorium should have been filled with silence.`
`However, I could hear a small commotion.`
`In this world of suspended time, ......I could see dark shapes sneaking about behind the unmoving students.`
`They were.........students with goat heads.`
`They were sneaking glances at me from behind the frozen students, whispering something to each other.`
`I know.`
` I can hear them.`
`Everybody...everybody knows.`
`One after another, students with goat heads slipped out from every conceivable hiding place.`
`They slipped around all the students stopped in time...and gathered around me.`
`Then, they all jeered out things in an endless stream, and, possibly aware that I could hear, showered me with giggles and sneers and comments amongst themselves.`
`However, nothing that came from the goats' mouths reached my ears as words.`
`This was a world without letters or words, ......so no words reached me.`
`However, their emotions and meanings did reach me.`
`So, I knew what it was they were saying.`
`And then, when I was able to visualize it, .........this happened...`
`One after another, the goats opened their massive jaws, showing their fangs that dripped with saliva,`
` ......and came forward to bite me.`
`Time was stopped for me.`
`{n}I was aware, but I could not move.`
`......Literally, that wasn't true.`
`However, I was pretending that I couldn't hear, ......so I couldn't move.`
`The goats bit me all over my body, leaving their fang marks, licking me.`
`Maybe they didn't like the taste of my clothes.`
`Taking advantage of the fact that I couldn't move, ......they chewed through my clothes one by one.`
`Over and over again, ......the goats stuck their tongues, their jaws, their fangs into my naked body.`
`I was covered with drool and bitten all over.`
`Bright red teeth marks were left behind as sharp fangs pierced my skin, leaving trails of blood.`
`They licked up that blood like real goats, ......hurting and humiliating me.`
`As I hung my head, one of the goats pulled on my hair, forcing me to look up, and spoke.`
`This time, it wasn't conceptual, but words I could hear.`
`However, they weren't words of the human world.`
` They were a witch's words.`
`The red truth, which signifies absolute truth.`
`‘This is...{p:1:the truth of the Rokkenjima incident}!!’`
`"............I won't accept it."`
`‘It doesn't matter if you accept it or not!!`
` This is the truth!!`
` {p:1:After all, *********, ******************!!`
` *********************************}!!!’`
`"......I won't accept it, I won't! ......I'll never accept a truth like that, ......never......"`

`Who cares about the truth, so stupid, so pointless...!`
`{n}I'm the one who gets to decide if that's the truth or not, right?`
`Even if it's red truth, I won't acknowledge it, won't permit it, and I definitely won't accept it...!!`
`"The red truth is absolute?!`
` Who is it absolute for?!`
` It's absolute for you guys, right?`
` It's not absolute for me!!`
` I won't let you contaminate my truth with yours!!"`
`".........Ange, calm down.`
` You're the one who wanted to know, right?"`
`"Hahahaha, ah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!`
` My truth is that Aunt Eva's the culprit!!`
` Aunt Eva killed everyone!!`
` Everything's her fault!!`
` Dad and Mom and Onii‐chan and all the others are just victims...!!`
` It's no one's fault, no one's fault...!!`
` How could it be? How could it be?!"`
`― Your aunt will always be on your side, Ange‐chan.`
`"Hahahaha, ah{0}hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!`
` Yeah, I get it now, I know what you meant!`

` That's right, Aunt Eva, you're the culprit, you're the culprit!!`
` It's the world that's messed up and broken for not realizing that...!!`
` I'm the right one, I'll deny the red truth, deny the whole world...!!!"`
`".........Oh?`
` ......In that case, try writing a red truth that only you can write.`
` ......But how is it possible for a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} to write with red truth?"`
`"It is possible!!`
` There's a red ink that only {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s can write with!!"`
`Ange‐san, please calm down.`
`"I'm the right one!! The world's wrong!!`
` I'll write it!!`
` I'll write the truth with the real red truth!!`
` Haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah, aha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"`
`20, requesting urgent support on the roof!!`
`Ange‐san!!`
` Wait!!`
` Don't be hasty, look ooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ouuuut!!!`
`"<Goodbye, Ange. Have a nice day.>"`

` I'll never accept the truth of your woo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}orld!!!"`
`Ange's body went past the edge of the balcony.`
`The air, which she had once been able to swim through, was now completely merciless for some reason.`
`Ange's body......plunged straight into the darkness below.`
`"................................."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} just watched the scene play out in silence......`
`Behind her, men in black suits rushed up to the fence, clutching it and screaming...`
`"T‐......this is 20......!`
` ......A‐......Ange‐san......j‐jumped off...!"`
`"Damn, ......I can't see her from here..."`
`"Q‐quickly, investigate the ground area...!!`
` It's no use, there's no way...!!"`
`"M‐...maybe she was caught by that safety net...!`
` L‐let's make sure...!"`
`What fools.`
`If you jumped straight down from this height, ......do you really think such a flimsy safety net could possibly save you......?`
`"As the Witch of Miracles, I, {f:5:Bernkastel}, guarantee that such a miracle certainly won't occur.`
` .........*giggle*giggle*giggle*, ......hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}haha!!"`
`Ange's body......fell from the skyscraper‐like bookshelf and slammed against the floor of the City of Books.`
`Looking down from {f:5:Bernkastel}'s balcony, which was as high as a skyscraper's roof,`
` ......could it have looked like a lovely, red pressed flower?`
`It couldn't have looked like anything.`
`In the same way that the death of a single lonely girl who rejected the world and died alone......wouldn't leave an impression on any of the world's people.`
`She probably died instantly.`
`It was only natural.`
` She had fallen straight down from such a height, after all.`
`......Is it even conceivable that she wouldn't die instantly after something like that?`
`The index finger on the right hand of her corpse was stuck out as though it had traced something.`
`Could it be that, by some impossible miracle, she really had escaped an instant death?`
`And in her final moments, ......using the ink of the red blood draining from her, could she possibly have written her own personal red truth?`
`However, no one would ever be able to tell what she had written.`
`After all, ......the red blood pouring from her corpse had run over it all.`
`"............Even this...was your decision,`
` .........Ange."`
`{f:5:Eva} was looking down at the beautiful flower of blood radiating from Ange's corpse.`
`"......I tried to give you a chance to live.`
` ......But you never truly made an effort to live in the future that began after the age of six.`
` .........And so, after twelve years, you've finally returned to where you started."`
`The eyes on Ange's corpse...were closed.`
`......However, there was no way of knowing if this was a peaceful thing.`
`Slowly, the corpse began to break down.`
`By the end, it had become a messy lump of flesh, with only a few parts recognizable as human.`
`......It was hardly surprising.`
`How else would she look after falling from that height......and slamming against the asphalt?`
`"You managed to die.`
` ......However,`
` this doesn't mean that everyone will be waiting for you in heaven.`
` ......After all, you reached this place by rejecting all of those in heaven.`
` .........<See you in hell>.`
` No, that's probably where we are right now.`
` .........So long, Ange."`
`"Ah, {f:5:Eva}.`
` Perfect timing."`
`"Did you call for me, my master?"`
`"Dispose of this scrap meat for me, if you wouldn't mind.`
` I'm going to put this back."`
`In {f:5:Bernkastel}'s hands was the key, which had lost its magic when Ange had made her decision, and the Book of the Single Truth, which had been locked up again.`
`"As you wish, my master."`
`After looking down one more time, {f:5:Bernkastel} vanished.`
`Once she had gone, {f:5:Eva} summoned some cat familiars and ordered them to clean up.`
`The black cats gathered Ange's flesh and scattered limbs and threw them into a tin bucket.`
`.........Even in this miserable form...`
`{n}Ange's soul......was still living.`
`Perhaps "living" is a poor description.`
`She...was unable to die.`
` From now on, forever.`
`She would drift along in the deepest depths of oblivion, covered by the dust of oblivion, until she finally......disappeared.`
`She continued to question herself.`
`What did the truth mean to her?`
`{n}What was right, and where was the place she could call home......?`
`As her flesh began to cool, even the energy to ask these questions...began to fade...`
`Eventually, ......she would forget her everyday memories, and even the reason why she was suffering.`
`However, there was one thing she would never be able to forget.`
`That was...the anguish.`
`From this point forth, ......she would suffer endlessly without even knowing why.`
`By the time the cats finished flinging her corpse into the bucket and dumping it into the sea of nothingness,`
` ............Ange had forgotten even her own name.........`
`.........What's this sound I keep hearing?`
`Yes, it must be............the sound of rain...`
`In that case, what are those two bright lights coming towards me?`
`......I don't know.`
`However, they came at me with a screeching sound...and stopped right in front of me.`
`A blaring noise came at me over and over.`
`Whatever's shining those bright lights...is threatening me.`
`{n}It's probably telling me to get out of the way.`
`However, I was incapable of moving even a finger......`
`There was a sound......of a car door opening.`
`Car.`
` ......Door.`
`Apparently, I was lying on asphalt under the pouring rain.`
