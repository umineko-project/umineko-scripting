`I saw a figure, apparently the driver, open an umbrella and come towards me...`
`".........Is this your garden?"`
`The figure questioned me.`
`{n}Of course, I couldn't answer it...`
`"......If it is, then I must apologize.`
` Yes, on a day with such fine weather, anyone would want to take a nap in such a lovely garden as this.`
` ......And yet, unless my memory fails me..."`
`The figure crouched down and looked into my face.`
` .........It was a woman.`
`"This is a public highway you're sleeping on.`
` Do you want to become roadkill?`
` ......Or maybe you already are roadkill.`
` Well now, which one is it?"`
`I......clenched my chest.`
`I felt I needed to answer somehow and establish communication.`
`So, after a lot of effort, ......I managed to let a short groan escape my lips.`
`"......I see.`
` So you aren't roadkill yet."`
`And that.........was how I met Ikuko.`
`"......The body is in a very frail condition.`
` Also, it is probable that there will be memory defects.`
` We won't know for sure until the CT scan, but brain damage is also a possibility."`
`"It's lucky that damage is all we have to deal with.`
` Spend much longer in a spot like that, and things would likely have been much worse."`
`"......True.`
` In any event, I recommend getting this checked at a large hospital."`
`"Thank you, Doctor.`
` .........Please keep this off the record.`
` It may not be much, but here's some money for your troubles."`
`"I see no reason to speak of this needlessly, but...`
` ......No, no, I couldn't possibly accept that much..."`
`In the end, the doctor took the money and swore to keep quiet about the matter.`
`Eventually, Hachijo returned.`
`"Oh, you've been awake.`
` How do you feel...?"`
`I nodded weakly, letting her know that it wasn't so bad for now.`
`......But...where is this place?`
`{n}A room I have absolutely no memory of, ......in a house I don't remember at all.`
`{n}And, first and foremost, here's a woman that I've never seen......`
`"To start off, let me introduce myself.`
` I'm Hachijo Ikuko.`
` I don't mind if you address me in a friendly manner as Ikuko, or if you prefer to call me Hachijo‐san and keep things more formal."`
`......Hachijo.........Ikuko.`
`"The Hachijo family owns a lot of land and is well known in these parts.`
` ......Unlike my accomplished brothers, I'm what you might call a little eccentric.`
` After I got into a bit too much mischief than was good for me, my parents finally ran out of patience and kicked me out.`
` I'm now confined to this house."`
`"......As a hobby, I like to read detective novels...and also to write them.`
` My age...is a single woman's secret.`
` My heart is that of a girl, but I'm approaching the point where calling myself one would be increasingly absurd.`
` Heheheheh."`
`With the haze my mind was in, it was extremely hard to make out what she was talking about.`
`However, ......I was able to pick up on the fact...that she was trying to talk to me cheerfully.`
`"......So, what's your name?"`
`..................My......name......`
`..............................`
`Logically, I know that, being a human, I must have a name.`
`And, I do have the feeling that I did indeed have a name.`
`......However, no matter how hard I tried to remember what it was, it just made my head hurt...`
`"Is there anything you can remember besides your name...?"`
`".........................................."`
`Who......am I......?`
`My head...`
`...no, even my heart was a mess of torn flesh,`
` ......and I couldn't remember a thing, ......not even who or what I was...`
`But I must remember.`
`I had some kind of purpose......or maybe a mission.`
`In order to remember that, .........I first have to remember who I am.`
`Who am I......?`
` What is my name......?`
` Where was I born......and what was my birthday......?`
`I need to remember something, anything............`
`.......................................`
`"...............Age......"`
`"Age?`
` *giggle*.`
` That's my little secret."`
`".........Eighteen..."`
`"I look like I'm eighteen...?!"`
`"......I'm............eighteen............"`
`"O‐oh, so that was your age...!`
` Well now, I thought you were being a bit too flattering.`
` Hahahaha."`
`When I asked myself how old I was, the number "eighteen" floated into my mind.`
`To be honest, I didn't really feel eighteen.`
`......My mind felt much younger than that, ......and my pathetic body felt much older.`
`"I see.`
` So you're eighteen.`
` And that's all you can remember."`
`I nodded weakly.`
`I never knew that knowing nothing about yourself could make you feel so powerless.`
`"In that case, until you remember your name,`
` let's give you the name "Tohya", written with the characters for "eighteen".`
` ......Hachijo Tohya.`
` What do you think?`
` Yeah, that sounds pretty cool.`
` Yes, I must say I've impressed myself very much with that one."`
`Hachijo......Ikuko gave a satisfied laugh.`
`From then on, I took the name Hachijo Tohya.`
`My inability to move my body was apparently due to a traffic accident.`
`On that day, I had been hit by a car, and Ikuko had picked me up from where I lay on the street.`
`If she hadn't hit the brakes...`
`She probably would've driven straight onwards, thinking she'd run over a dead dog or something.`
`......Later on, I—perhaps rudely—suspected that the one who hit me might have been Ikuko herself,`
` but when I saw her completely undamaged front bumper, I gave up on that theory.`
`Hachijo Ikuko lived in a small but lovely mansion on the top of a small hill, in a village with a view of the sea.`
`She also owned the hill behind her and was more than capable of enjoying the four seasons in privacy.`
`As time passed slowly, my rehabilitation continued, and my ability to move improved little by little.`
`However, ......it seemed I really had suffered some form of brain damage.`
`Finding out who I was.........looked like it would be a very difficult task.`
`In the beginning, when I couldn't bear not knowing my identity, my head often hurt so much it felt as though it would explode.`
`......However, as I slowly accepted the fact that I was a new person, with the new name of Hachijo Tohya,`
` ......the headaches became less frequent.`
`The whole time, ......no memories returned to me except the fact that I had been eighteen.`
`However, I was unable to remember any more, unable even to be sure that eighteen was my true age,`
` ......and eventually, I stopped trying to remember my former self.`
`"Good morning, Tohya.`
` That was quite the storm last night. Were you able to sleep well?"`
`".........I had some trouble falling asleep.`
` So, I decided to read your manuscript."`
`"My, my.`
` How far did you manage to get?"`
`"I finished it."`
`"......Now there's a surprise.`
` You managed to read through all that in a single night?"`
`"I was surprised too.`
` ......Once I got into it, I'd finished before I knew it.`
` ......It was like I was just skimming it, ......or maybe like I was reading each page in a glance......"`
`"It sounds like you have some talent at speed reading.`
` ......So, how was it?`
` What did you think of it?"`
`"I liked it a lot.`
` Still, if you don't explain that part about the ocean currents a bit more clearly, it might be a little unfair for the reader...`
` Oh, but I thought it was great that you had the foreshadowing with the ring right there at the beginning."`
`".........After I finished, I had to go back to the beginning and slap myself for being so easily tricked.`
` I think that feeling's the best part of a detective novel."`
`"...................................."`
`"......Um, ......did I say something to offend you?`
` ......If I did, I apologize."`
`"Of course not! Why are you apologizing...?!`
` I'm just shocked, that's all.`
` The pertinence of your remarks is commendable...`
` It seems you must also have some talent as a critic or a detective novel writer."`
`...............A detective novel...writer.`
` ......A critic.`
`{n}........................`
`From across the fog of oblivion...`
`...I seem to remember myself fighting and arguing about......mysteries, ......or something like that.`
`That way of fighting, which I must have learned in the past.........sent a surge of excitement through me.`
`......Mystery.`
` ......Fighting......`
` My head......hurt.........`
`I accepted a painkiller and swallowed it with fresh water brought up from the well.`
`Who am I......really.........?`
`......But no matter how much I thought, I couldn't remember.`
`I was told that the frequency of my headaches could be lessened by brain surgery, but also that there was no guarantee that it would do my memory any good.`
`Ikuko said that she would let me have surgery if I wanted it.`
`However, I refused.`
`Even if I can't remember it, ......the real me is still there, sleeping inside my head.`
`I was scared......that the surgery might harm that "me" somehow.`
`By now, I've gotten used to dealing with headaches.`
`......As long as I don't force myself to remember the past, the headaches don't torment me every day.`
`So, ......bit by bit, I became free of the headaches...and got used to my new life as Hachijo Tohya......`
`Gradually, my interest shifted from myself to Ikuko.`
`Hachijo Ikuko.`
`A very strange woman.`
`First off, she was apparently the daughter of a very well‐off family, just as she had said.`
`However, she was considerably eccentric,`
` and the "various mischievous incidents" she spoke of had apparently gotten her within an inch of being disowned.`
`As a result, she had been given this house, and had been ordered to live here quietly and alone.`
`She had never been a particularly social person, so she happily accepted this new state of affairs,`
` living however she pleased with servants to take care of her.`
`She had no friends.`
` No one ever came to visit.`
`Besides me, the only one she ever talked to was Bern, an old black cat she kept as a pet.`
`I didn't know her real age.`
`She didn't seem to be too old to marry yet, but she wasn't likely to meet anyone new leading an isolated life like this.`
`Despite her insistence that she just hadn't met anyone worth the trouble, I felt as though she'd already given up on marriage.`
`Her everyday life changed very little.`
`She would either read through the many detective novels that were brought to her, or else write detective novels herself.`
`At first, I thought she was some novelist at a private retreat, plugging away at a new book.`
`However, the manuscripts she finished just ended up clipped together in a pile.`
`With me as the sole exception, it didn't look like she gave them to anyone else to read.`
`A novelist is someone who writes novels for other people to read.`
`So, I figured you could hardly call her a novelist when she kept writing novels no one would ever read.`
`"......Ikuko‐san, why don't you ever show these to anyone?"`
`"I show them to you.`
` Only the better ones, of course."`
`"Haven't you ever thought of sending one to some publishing company?`
` ......It's a shame for things to be this way, when your works are so interesting."`
`"My works can't stand up against the pros.`
` I sent one in once, but it was absolutely no good.`
` I understand my position.`
` This is just an amateur's pastime."`
`"I don't think "amateur" is a fitting word for someone who's so well‐versed in detective novels from all times and places across the world."`
`"Being a big eater doesn't mean you'll make a good cook.`
` Reading every detective novel you can get your hands on provides no guarantee of being a good detective novelist.`
` That's how it is.`
` That's why this is nothing more than a pastime."`
`"......Is it really fun to write novels that you won't show to anyone?"`
`"It used to be.`
` ......Once."`
`"What about now?"`
`"I like getting to hear your opinions.`
` .........At any rate, I've finished writing the chapter.`
` I'll go make some tea, so would you mind reading it again and sharing your thoughts with me?"`
`Saying this with a smile, Ikuko thrust a pile of manuscript paper at me.`
`When it comes to detective novels, reading and writing are the same.`
`{n}It's boring if you just do it by yourself.`
`You only get something really precious when you share the world with someone else.`
`........................Headache.`
`"Tohya?`
` ......Are you okay?`
` I'll go get some headache medicine."`
`"I'm fine.`
` I'm more interested in this manuscript.`
` I can't wait for the new chapter."`
`The seasons passed.`
`Together with Ikuko, in this town whose name I didn't even know,`
` I spent my days debating detective novels and talking about ideas for new plots.`
`At a glance, they may have appeared to be stale and unproductive days.`
`However, ......I found satisfaction with my new life as Hachijo Tohya.`
`"......And so, the curtain closes on the strange tale of Kurokubi Island.`
` .........The End."`
`With a dramatic flourish of her fountain pen, Ikuko signified that her manuscript was now complete.`
`"What do you think...?!`
` I tried using your plot to make Tsujiko's tragic love scene at the end a bit more moving."`
`"I think it's very good......`
` I think the last farewell is sad enough to make it moving as a story, not just a reasoning puzzle."`
`"......That's thanks to your plot.`
` ......Compared to this work, everything I've written before now is worth little more than scrap paper.`
` ......Even as I was writing it, I was excited to be the first person in the world who got to read it.`
` ......I've never felt that before."`
`"I just mentioned some ideas.`
` You're the one who turned them into such a fascinating story, Ikuko‐san."`
`Before I knew it, she had roped me in as well, and I too had dipped my toe into the world of detective novel writing.`
`......Apparently, the old me had possessed some knowledge of mysteries and detective novels and the like.`
`And my talent seemed to be of a fairly unorthodox kind.`
`I turned famous mysteries from across the world on their head, always looking to twist those ideas into something new.`
`However, a few ideas aren't enough to make a book.`
`No meal is complete if all you can do is chop up vegetables.`
`It was thanks to Ikuko's writing, a skill she had built up over many years, that my ideas were transformed into a work of fiction.`
`This first work that we had authored together, "The Strange Tale of Kurokubi Island", had brought out the best of our individual quirks,`
` ......and, though I hate to brag, it had turned into a masterpiece that we could show to anyone without shame.`
`"Hello?`
` Please bring us some champagne.`
` ......Bring a glass for yourself as well.`
` This is the best work ever created within these walls.`
` Let's celebrate."`
`Ikuko called for some champagne over the internal phone line.`
`Joined by the servant who happened to be working that day and the cat Bern, we raised our glasses high and toasted our accomplishment.`
`".........Ikuko‐san.`
` I have an idea, if you don't mind."`
`"Let's hear it.`
` There is never a wrong time for your ideas, as long as I'm not in the shower or on the can...!"`
`"Why don't we try submitting our book?`
` ......I've never read something this interesting before.`
` I'm sure lots of other people will want to read it."`
`"......You think so?`
` I tried once in the past, thinking the same thing, but the result was......"`
`"I believe in your talent, Ikuko‐san.`
` ......What about you?"`
`"Of course, I believe in your talent."`
`"Then it's decided.`
` ......To Ikuko‐san's big debut."`
`"To Tohya's big debut!"`
`We clinked our glasses once more.`
`{n}The evening wore on.........`
`We must've had way too much to drink.`
`Before I knew it, I must have passed out on the sofa.`
`There was a blanket covering me.`
` ......Ikuko‐san must've put it there.`
`The lights were out in the study, but it wasn't dark.`
`{n}The computer's monitor was glowing.`
`Outside, it had started to rain.`
`{n}......It reminded me of the day Ikuko‐san found me and took me in.`
`Because of that, ......whenever it rains, I find myself wondering who I was, ......and I usually get headaches.`
`So, I wasn't sure whether the pain was because of the rain or because I drank too much.`
`"......Ikuko‐san.`
` Turn on the lights.`
` ......Using a computer in the dark is bad for your eyes."`
`"Oh, did I wake you up?"`
`"No, I slept well.`
` Thanks to that, I feel refreshed."`
`I turned on the light and looked out through a gap in the curtains.`
`{n}......As I'd thought, it was the sort of pouring rain that always reminded me of that day.`
`"It's raining pretty hard out there.`
` The wind looks pretty strong too.`
` I hope the rain gutters don't get clogged with leaves again."`
`"......I just had them cleaned the other day, so they should be fine for a while."`
`Her answer sounded a little abstracted.`
`{n}Apparently, her attention was absorbed by the computer.`
`"You've been pretty hooked by that computer lately, Ikuko‐san.`
` Did you find an interesting article or something?"`
`".........It may be a bit juvenile, but it's still pretty interesting.`
` ......You know, that Rokkenjima incident."`
`"......Rokkenjima.........?"`
`"I told you about the Rokkenjima mystery a few days ago, remember?`
` It's been really huge on the net lately.`
` The discussions, theories, and especially the Forgeries have been quite entertaining.`
` ......The "Forgeries" are stories with the premise that further message bottles signed by Ushiromiya Maria existed and washed up on one of the nearby islands......"`
`Only too happy to share her knowledge of the subject, Ikuko continued her explanation at length.`
`......However, ......a huge bell was clanging inside my head.`
`The noise was so great that I thought my head would split open.`
`Unable to tell what was the floor and what was the ceiling, ......I crumpled and clutched at my head...`
`"Tohya......are you okay...?!"`
`"......My head.........hurts....................."`
`The Rokkenjima Explosion Accident.`
`{n}The many disquieting rumors surrounding it.`
`The scheming of the relatives after Ushiromiya Kinzo's vast wealth and the hidden gold......`
`And the truth?`
`Ushiromiya Eva, the sole survivor, said nothing.`
`Eventually, the granddaughter, Ushiromiya Ange, who escaped harm because she was absent on that day, would inherit everything......`
`Ange, ......Ange... ............Ushiromiya...Ange............`
`......I am...Ushiromiya...............`
` Ggghh......`
`No good...my head is......splitting......`
`An incomprehensible scene pierced my eyelids from the inside like a blade of light.`
`Just what......am I looking at......?`
`Who......are these people......calling to me.........but not by the name Tohya...?`
`......Who............am I.........?`
` Who are these people......?`
` What is............this memory.........?`
`Help me, Ikuko.........`
` .........Someone else's memory............is hurting me.........`
`My...head's......splitting.....................`
`{a:c:......I can hear the sorrowful sound of wind......`
`{n}And......that must be rain.`
`{n}......Who......am I, again...?`
`{n}I am......Ushiromiya......}`
`{a:c:`
`"Ange! ......Ange...!!"}`
`{a:c:`
`"Please, please say something...!!"}`
`{a:c:Voices...`
` Voices calling to me}.`
`{a:c:Dad......and Mom......}`
`{a:c:......It can't be them......}`
`{a:c:In 1986, ......on Rokkenjima,{n}......Mom and Dad......}`
`"......Ange, hang in there...!`
` Can you hear Daddy's voice...?!"`
`"Please, say something!! Ange!!"`
`......Mom, Dad......`
`{n}I'll......say it out loud......`
`.........Mom......Dad.........`
`"Ange...!!`
` Ange, thank goodness......!!"`
`I could feel my body being lifted up firmly......and hugged roughly.`
`......Mom and Dad......were hugging me......`
`My eyelids had been open for a while now.`
`{n}I could feel the light slowly returning to my eyes.`
`Just like your eyes get used to the dark, ......my eyes got used to the light, ......and bit by bit, the scene around me came into view.`
`However, it was an unusual sight, which seemed to be very far away.`
`My body......was being hugged by Mom and Dad.`
`Dad was sniffling, his face covered with tears.`
`There were tears in Mom's eyes too as she hugged me tight.`
`It was......so strong that it hurt a bit.`
`I was......the bad kid, who wasn't obedient, who always had an excuse, ......and who always tried to do the opposite of what her parents said.`
` .........That was why......they were holding me tight, .........to make sure I didn't head down the wrong path......`
`As my eyes adjusted, I could see other people besides my parents.`
`Everyone was there.`
` George onii‐chan, Jessica onee‐chan, Maria onee‐chan.`
`My uncles and aunts.`
`......Even Sakutarou.`
` ......And then, there was the witch {f:5:Virgilia}, and Ronove, and...............`
`"...............Where............"`
`"You were fortunate.`
` ......By chance, we found you drifting in the waves of the sea of emptiness.`
` ......You were in a terrible state.`
` ......It took much time to make you remember your true form."`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice}...`
` ............So, this is......"`
`"The Golden Land.`
` ......Your whole family has been waiting here for you to return."`
`"......We knew you would come home."`
`Did I.........come home because I was supposed to...?`
`......Didn't I............return to the form I was meant to have, ......and then...............`
`"No, you did come home."`
`"That's right.`
` You made it back here because you wanted to come home to us."`
`".........Dad, ......Mom...`
` .........I..............."`
`"You don't need to say anything.`
` .........You've been on a great and terrible journey, haven't you?`
` ......You took that journey all by yourself..."`
`"You understand now, don't you?`
` You won't forget again?"`
`I understand, ......Dad...`
`"......This is...a place you can always call home..."`
`"............I know..."`
`When I gave that answer, Mom and Dad hugged me again.`
`Hot tears fell onto my face.`
`They were Mom and Dad's tears......`
`"............‘All right’......might not be the best way to put it.`
` ......But I'm so glad.`
` Glad you came home."`
`"......Aunt.........Eva......"`
`"Feel free to hate me as much as you want.`
` ......But give your Mom and Dad a million kisses.`
` ......Give a kiss to everyone who cared about you so much."`
`"Aunt...... ............Eva............."`
`".........And say "I'm home" to your other mother."`
`Mom gave me a push from behind, ............and I stumbled forwards.`
`Towards my...other mother.`
`".........Eva...... ...............Mom............"`
`"......Ange‐chan..............."`
`"If only............I'd called you that on that day,`
` .........I might never have messed up......`
` ......We might have been able......to create a new world together......"`
`"It's in the past now.`
` ......You've come home.`
` .........You don't need to say anything else..."`
`"Mom......`
` ............Mom.................."`
`"Welcome home, Ange‐chan...`
` ............You're my precious daughter......"`
`"Mom......`
` ............You were always, ......to the very end, .........the one looking out for me the most............"`
`The two of them hugged each other quietly, ......burying their faces in the other's shoulders and sobbing.`
`The truth...wasn't worth anything at all.`
`In the first place, ......the truth is always in the past.`
`The point of the future isn't to learn what happened in the past.`
`What really matters...is whether I truly live and prosper in the truth that is "the now".`
`How can there be any truth......in a life not truly lived?`
`Back when I only ever tried to see the truth of the past, I was nothing more than a ghost trapped in that past.`
`Since that time, I haven't lived a single day.`
`......Now, I truly understand.`
`This is what.........real truth is.........`
`"I will......live......`
` ......And I've remembered how much everyone loved me......"`
`Because I was young and selfish, I didn't even remember until now.`
`The kind grandpa who always spoiled me.`
`The entertaining aunts and uncles.`
`All of the kind and gentle servants.`
`......It was always...warm.`
`And yet, because I was young and cruel, I never even tried to retain any of those memories.`
`Everyone was distorted by my irresponsible imagination, ......and I completely forgot how things were......`
`Now, I can remember clearly, and I understand.`
`It's true that the Halloween quiz party itself was an illusion.`
`We never did anything like that.`
`......But there were all kinds of other fun things we {i:did} do when the relatives gathered,`
` .........things that were no more or less fun than that party.........`
`Then, ......for the first time since the start of the game...`
`...I went up to each and every one of them......to greet them, thank them, and apologize.`
`To thank Grandpa for always pampering me.`
`To thank my aunts and uncles.`
`To thank the cousins for always playing with me even though I was so selfish.`
`......And to thank the creatures of fantasy......and apologize to them.`
`I think I said something horrible to Sakutarou once, in the past.`
`And to Maria onee‐chan too.`
`"......Maria onee‐chan, you really were a witch, weren't you?"`
`"I've always been a witch.`
` ......You approached that level yourself once, didn't you?"`
`"No.`
` I never really understood.`
` ......I felt sorry for you and your magic.`
` ......I could {i:only} feel sorry for you...`
` .........So, ......I couldn't pick up a fragment of happiness, couldn't even find one.`
` .........You told me that yourself once, Onee‐chan......"`
`"......It can't be helped.`
` It takes two to create a universe.`
` ......I had Beato, but you were all alone."`
`"No.`
` ......If only I could have called Aunt Eva "Mom", there would have been two of us.`
` ......I'm sure I'd have been able to create a new world with the same magic you used, Maria onee‐chan."`
`".........All of it is my fault.`
` The message bottles I threw into the sea for fun caused a distortion in your future and wore you down.`
` ......I bear responsibility for that."`
`"......Yeah, seriously.`
` It's all because of your message bottles.`
` Because of those, people started copying you and making Forgeries, ......growing the story into something crazy."`
`However, the message bottles thrown into the sea by Beato did not name a specific person as the culprit.`
`......One of the Forgers wrote a plausible Forgery that had Ushiromiya Eva as the culprit, ......which spread like wildfire...`
`I should've known better than anyone that it couldn't possibly be true, ......but even I accepted it in the end.`
`"............It isn't your fault, Beato.`
` ......No matter how many people around me had their baseless suspicions,`
` ......there should've been only one truth inside me.`
` And yet, so easily, ......I abandoned my warm memories of all of you,`
` ......and surrendered my heart to them."`
`"No, no.`
` If I had not thrown the message bottles, future Rokkenjima would never have become a flourishing ground for such bizarre misconceptions.`
` I bear responsibility for it all."`
`"......True.`
` That's right, it really is your fault after all."`
`"Mgh.`
` ......It's a little irritating to hear you say it so boldly.`
` ......I changed my mind, you have your share of the blame as well!"`
`"........................`
` ......Yeah, you're right.`
` You were at fault, and so was I.`
` ......Still, it'd be stupid for us to attack each other.`
` ......After all, I'm a witch of the future.`
` You're a witch of the past.`
` ......I should be using that magic to build my future.`
` ......We both bear responsibility in some way,`
` but neither of us has the right to blame the other."`
`".........I knew you could do it, Ange.`
` I knew you'd be able to understand Mariage Sorcière's teachings."`
`"You're right.`
` ......As the final member of Mariage Sorcière, ......it's my responsibility to pass on your magic."`
`"My magic can make everyone happy."`
`"Indeed...!`
` You have both pure magic and wicked magic at your fingertips...!"`
`".........That's true.`
` Magic can change completely depending on your heart.`
` ......You can't use magic properly without the proper guidance.`
` ......And proper magic can guide people to happiness."`
`"It is a wonderful thing...`
` .........Bringing people happiness is the sole reason that witches wield magic.`
` ......I am very pleased that we were finally able to pass on this lesson to the last in the line of Endless Witches..."`
`"Sorry for failing to pass it down myself at all."`
`"Witch of the Future, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}.`
` ......I hereby retract your expulsion from Mariage Sorcière."`
`"Uryuu!`
` I knew Ange would come back...!"`
`"Congratulations, Ange‐sama!"`
`"......Back in the days when I traveled together with you all, I remember thinking I understood all this...but I didn't.`
` ......I'm sorry.`
` I'm really sorry......"`
`"Witches cannot create a universe unless there are two.`
` ......In the future, you will be alone. ......Will you really be okay...?"`
`"Yeah, I'll be okay.`
` ......I'm not alone anymore.`
` ......I'll...live.`
` ......With everyone.`
` And I'll live in the future.`
` I swear to keep living, so that I can pass on the magic of Mariage Sorcière."`
`"Maria onee‐chan's magic has saved me too.`
` .........There are a lot of people out there who need magic.`
` Teaching it the right way and saving as many people as I can...`
`...is my mission as the final witch of Mariage Sorcière."`
`"Will you truly be able to do so...?"`
`"Of course. I have the power to do it.`
` There's the golden magic that my predecessor, {f:5:Eva Beatrice}, spent so much time building.`
` I've inherited all of that. Right?"`
`"*giggle*.`
` ......If only my health had held out a little longer, I was planning to spend all of it on myself."`
`*giggle*, ......aha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha.`
`As Ange laughed, tears poured from her eyes again.`
`Everyone surrounded Ange with their kind, warm smiles......`
`Battler stood alone in the rose garden maze, letting the rain quietly fall on him......`
`After searching for some time, Ange found him.`
`"............Onii‐chan........."`
`".............................."`
`Ange, who was feeling guilty, sensed anger in her brother's expression.`
`So, ......she thought he was going to hit her.`
`She shut her eyes tight.`
`However, her brother touched her softly.`
`He patted her head gently.`
`".........See?"`
`".................."`
`"The truth......wasn't anything important, was it?"`
`".........No, it wasn't.`
` ......Even though you were here, ......waiting for me to come home in such a......warm world......`
` .........I had my back turned......the whole time......"`
`"You learned the truth."`
`"...............Yeah..."`
`"So, any hopes you had of someone miraculously surviving and coming back......have been crushed.`
` ......However, you now have a new mission and a new hope to help you live in the future."`
`"......You kept those precious hopes safe for me.`
` ......And I opened the box with my own hands and let them all escape.`
` ......It turned out worse than Pandora's box.`
` ......A truth I didn't need to know flew out of the box, along with all my hopes, ......leaving nothing inside but empty space..."`
`"That's okay.`
` ......It's open now, and that's that.`
` An empty box isn't so bad—it's a clean slate, a fresh start.`
` And anyway, if you're harboring false hopes, sometimes it's better just to pull out the thorn."`
`Battler laughed heartily.`
`{n}Then, with that same smile on his face, he told her.`
`"We're already dead."`
`"...............Yeah."`
`"You've lived twelve years on the hope that we might still be alive.`
` Not anymore.`
` That's over and done with."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......I know.`
` Starting now, ......I'll step forward into a new life."`
`"Beato put Rokkenjima in the cat box.`
` The next witch, Auntie Eva, guarded the lid of that cat box her whole life.`
` ......The witch after that was you, and you opened that lid, ......but so what?`
` Why does the truth of the past matter?"`
`".........Yeah.`
` ......From now on, I'll truly live.`
` And I'll make my own personal truth prosper."`
`"Good luck,`
` final witch of Mariage Sorcière.`
` ......I've read Maria's grimoire.`
` It's a great book, with some really good stuff written in it."`
`"Even the Bible needs a translator.`
` So, Maria's grimoire probably needs one too.`
` ......You will be that translator.`
` ......You've got to teach it to kids who are in the position you once were.`
` That's your mission as the new Witch of the Future."`
`"......Yeah."`
`"I'm...gone.`
` But I'll always be behind you, watching over you."`
`"I know.`
` ......And not just you.`
` Everyone else too..."`
`".........We all love you......and we'll love you forever and ever.`
` Don't forget that......"`
`"......I won't...`
` .........Never......never ever..............."`
`Ange leapt into Battler's chest......and sobbed.`
`{y:0:Human}{n:0:Human}s are sad creatures, who can "learn" but not "unlearn".`
`She had already learned.`
`It was a cruel, terrifying, merciless thing, ......capable of destroying even the miracle called hope.`
`......However, there was still one tiny fragment left gripped in her hand.`
`Her family's...love.`
`If Ange could just remember that love and hold on to it tightly.........then she could surely live on...`
`She could stop herself from taking that single step into nothingness......`
`"Besides... The Rokkenjima cat box hasn't yet been opened completely.`
` ......You've just taken a peek at what's inside.`
` So now...you must be the lid yourself."`
`"And, this time, you'll be the one to protect everyone inside the cat box.`
` Me and Dad and Kyrie‐san, the cousins and the uncles and the aunts.`
` Grandfather and the servants.`
` ......And all of the fantasy people."`
`"...............Yeah.`
` ......This time......I have to......protect everyone........."`
`{a:c:`
`"Then shouldn't you hurry up a bit?"}`
`From the other side of a rose bush came the sound of popcorn being eaten.`
`......It was {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
`"I'm pretty sure you know this,`
` ......but Bern is just about to hold a big party for the Book of the Single Truth.`
` She's gathered beings from heaven and from hell, from the spirit world and from parallel worlds.`
` If she announces what's in that book in a place like that, it'll all be too late, won't it?"`
`".........I'm...going.`
` ......I gave {f:5:Bernkastel} that key.`
` It's my responsibility.`
` I'll go and bring it back."`
`"The City of Books, is it?`
` But there's no way for us to get in.`
` There's a barrier around that place."`
`"......She gave me this.`
` With it, I can come and go as I please.`
` .........What an idiot.`
` She forgot to collect it when she threw me away."`
`Ange fished through her pocket, and there was a jingling sound.`
`It was a bell with a blue ribbon tied to it.`
`".........That's it.`
` One of those temporary entry passes that you get when you turn in your invitation.`
` As long as you have that, at least one of you will be able to get into the City of Books.`
` Well, as long as someone takes you across the sea of fragments first."`
`"{f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` Take me to the City of Books."`
`"......Ange."`
`"This is my way of taking responsibility.`
` .........I'll see that the Book of the Single Truth isn't made public."`
`".........Are you serious?`
` That place is a den of monsters among monsters.`
` Now that you've lost Bern's protection, you'll be weaker than a fly.`
` You'll be smushed and that'll be the end of you."`
`"Ah—"`
`The bell was stolen from Ange's hands.`
`"{f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` I'll go there.`
` ......I just need you to take me and send me on my way.`
` I'm an empty creature anyway, unable to exist outside the cat box.`
` Ange, on the other hand, has to live on into the future.`
` And you're also a person with a future.`
` ......So I'll go.`
` I have nothing to lose."`
`"No! This is my responsibility, my way of making up for what I did!`
` If I don't do it myself, the future won't change at all, and I won't be able to save the cat box of the future...!"`
`Ange tried to snatch the bell from Battler's hand, but Battler had no intention of giving it up.`
`The two of them were grimly serious, but from the sidelines, it just looked like an ordinary squabble between two close siblings.`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} watched this conversation and shrugged.`
`......If she just had to take either one of them to the City of Books, she wouldn't have to make any enemies, and there was no risk to her.`
`All she cared about was which one would make the story more interesting.`
` Nothing else.`
`But then, she finally noticed.`
`"Hold on.`
` ......Hold on a sec, you two. Hold on!"`
`"What's your problem?! Save it for later!!"`
`"We're having an important sibling discussion here!"`
`"Okay, first off,`
` let go of each other.`
` ......Battler's holding the bell now, right?`
` Jump, Battler."`
`"......Jump?`
` Like this?"`
`Jingle jingle.`
`"You next, Ange.`
` Try jumping."`
`"......Why me as well...?"`
`Jingle jingle.`
`"Huh......?`
` ......Why......?"`
`If Battler was holding the bell, where did that sound come from......?`
`Ange hurriedly searched through her pockets.`
`When she did, ......another blue‐ribboned bell came out of a different pocket than the first one.`
`"These are......the same, aren't they...?"`
`"......No way......`
` Why are there two?`
` I was only given one of them!"`
`"I don't know why.`
` But the point is, you've got two bells that'll get you into the City of Books.`
` Therefore, I don't have to sit here and watch the two of you play with each other anymore."`
`The pair of them gripped their bells and looked at each other.`
`"From the very beginning,`
` this game has belonged to the two of you.`
` ......There's just been a slight change in who the opponent is."`
`"......This game isn't a competition between you two.`
` It's a fight over the cat box, with you two who want to close the lid on one team, ......and Bern who wants it opened on the other.`
` Ange has moved from Bern's team to Battler's team.`
` That's all there is to it."`
`"{f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` Take us to the City of Books."`
`".........I hope you know I'm just taking you there!`
` After that, I'm done being anything but a spectator!`
` I'm just gonna be sitting nearby and watching, to see exactly how you fight, what you do, and how Bern is going to make mincemeat out of you both...!"`
`"{f:5:Lambdadelta}...... Thank you!"`
