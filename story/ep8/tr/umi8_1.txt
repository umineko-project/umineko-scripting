`"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!`
` Gonna fall, gonna fall, gonna faaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aalllll!!!"`
`Once again, Captain Kawabata's ferryboat to Rokkenjima cut across the sea in perfect form.`
`Yes.`
` The tale of October 4th, 1986, always begins with Battler's screams.`
`But this time, one thing was different.`
`{n}There was another person's yell alongside Battler's.`
`Battler was screaming.`
`{n}The other was...laughing?`
`"Gonna fall, gonna fall, gonna faaaaaaallll!!`
` Nooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooo...!!"`
`"Fun, fun, fuuuuuunnn!!`
` *giggle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"Battler looks funny, Battler looks funny!!`
` *giggle*, *giggle*giggle*!!"`
`Alongside the big brother, who was grasping at the handrail and screaming in a way that no one his age should,`
` was the little sister, also grasping the handrail and jumping about like it was a ride at an amusement park. George and the others just couldn't hold in their laughter at the difference.`
`"Even after six years, Battler‐kun's still just as energetic as I remember him."`
`"Ange and Maria look more lively than usual this year, too."`
`"Could this be the first time we've had all five cousins together?"`
`"Oh, is it?`
` Well, then, yeah!`
` This year's gonna be more lively than ever before."`
`"G‐George‐anikiiiiiiiii!!`
` Don't you think this is way too fast?!`
` I'm begging you, ask the captain to slow down before it's too laaaate!!"`
`"Kihiha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!`
` You call this fast? Battler, you're a wimp! You're a wimp!"`
`"I wanna go faster!!`
` Faster, faster!`
` *giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"Any faster than this, and your onii‐chan's gonna fall right off the boat!!`
` Is that what you want?!`
` I'm gonna faa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaalllll!!!"`
`"Hahaha.`
` Well, the votes have been counted, and Battler‐kun's proposal to lower the speed is—"`
`"Rejected, it looks like!`
` Aha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha."`
`"Look out, Onii‐chan. You're gonna fall, you're gonna fall!`
` Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"`
`"Battler needs to be punished for his cowardice!! Tickle time!`
` Kihihihihiii!!"`
`"W‐wait, stop, Maria!!`
` You too, Ange!`
` N‐nooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooo!!"`
`"Thank goodness for that.`
` I was worried about Ange's health, but she looks just fine."`
`"It would've been too sad to leave her behind at home.`
` I'm glad we decided to bring her anyway."`
`"Wasn't she very sick shortly before you left?"`
`"She was all better this morning.`
` Kids can be so incredible sometimes."`
`"I'll bet she's the type to get sick when she's stressed or overexcited!`
` It's not that strange for people like that to get all better when the big day finally comes."`
`"She must really have been looking forward to playing with all five of the cousins together."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` Just watching them play together makes one feel charged with energy, doesn't it?"`
`The adults smiled as they watched the children play around.`
`Ange had gotten very sick. For a time, everyone had expected that she would be absent, but she had made a miraculous recovery.`
`Thanks in part to her strong desire to join in, she had come along to the family conference with the others.`
`And so...`
`For the first time ever, all five cousins were gathered together.`
`{n}October 4th, 1986, became a day like no other.`
`The kids dashed up the path leading from the harbor to the rose garden.`
`They were probably so charged up that even walking was too boring for them.`
`"Wahhahahaha!`
` See that?!`
` First pla~ce!"`
`Battler was the first to leap across the finish line that was the entrance to the rose garden.`
`Apparently, he was trying to make up for the dishonor he had suffered on the boat by proving his superiority on land.`
`A short while later, Ange and Maria reached him in a dead heat.`
`"I'm second!!`
` I'm faster than Ange, uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"No, you aren't! Maria onee‐chan cheated!!`
` I'm second!!"`
`The three‐year gap between Ange and Maria was large, especially since both of them were growing kids.`
`It was only natural that Maria was faster, but Ange seemed to be complaining about a shoulder bump at the start line.`
`Maria onee‐chan cheated, so she gets last place!`
` Teacher always says you get last place if you cheat! ...Protested Ange.`
`"Come on, no need to fight.`
` Geez, you're both so fast...!"`
`"It's been a long time since I last ran like that......`
` Ah, the breeze feels so nice."`
`"Are you out of shape, George‐aniki?`
` You know, anyone who runs the daily "race to beat the bell" gets strong legs automatically."`
`"In other words, being a fast runner is proof that you sleep in."`
`"Onii‐chan always sleeps in!`
` He didn't wake up today either, so I had to wake him up!`
` Right?!"`
`"A stomp followed by a flying elbow.`
` And that body press from the top rope at the end there just about finished me."`
`"After a wake‐up like that, it sounds like you'd never get up again..."`
`"Sounds fun!`
` I wanna do it too, I wanna do it too!"`
`"I'll bet Onii‐chan sleeps in tomorrow!`
` We'll wake him up together this time, okay?! *giggle*giggle*!"`
`"......I'd recommend against staying up too late tonight."`
`Finally, the adults came into sight.`
`The cousins waved at them, urging them to hurry up.`
`{n}Ange and Maria were so excited that they could hardly wait.`
`Just by having all five cousins together...`
`{n}Just by adding Ange into the group...`
`Look at how energetic this day has become.`
`"Excuse me.`
` The family members have arrived."`
`"They made it here safely, then?`
` I must let Father know."`
`"Are they all in the guesthouse now?"`
`"Yes.`
` They will come here to meet you after they have set down their luggage."`
`"Understood.`
` Kanon, please guide everyone.`
` Shannon, quickly get some tea ready."`
`""As you wish, Madam.""`
`"Father. It's me, Krauss.`
` It's about time for you to get ready."`
`After Krauss knocked on the door, it opened from the inside.`
`"Oh, Doctor Nanjo.`
` How is Father doing?"`
`"No need to worry.`
` He's changing as we speak.`
` I think he's just a little nervous."`
`"Who are you calling nervous?!!`
` Nnhh, I cannot find my favorite One‐winged necktie pin!`
` How many times must I tell Natsuhi?`
` My possessions must never be moved without my approval...!"`
`Apparently, Kinzo had been in a panic for some time over the simple matter of choosing a tie and tie pin.`
`Kinzo, who valued the dignity of the family head above all else, always made a big deal about being appropriately attired.`
`"......Will he make it in time?"`
`"Do you think you could give us a little longer?`
` We'll come down as soon as he's ready."`
`"Understood.`
` I'm counting on you, Doctor Nanjo.`
` ......Father.`
` That necktie pin you have there looks splendid on you as well."`
`"The necktie pin "I have there"?!! Is {i:that} your suggestion?!!`
` The family conference is held but once a year!`
` Mgggh, there shall be no compromise! I must have that specific pin!!`
` Where is it, where, where?!!"`
`"Kinzo‐san, you already looked in that drawer five seconds ago......`
` Besides, you own several splendid necktie pins.`
` It would be stylish to select one befitting this auspicious occasion."`
`"Hmmmmmm, you think so?`
` So, I don't need to use the One‐winged Eagle pin...?`
` Hmmmmm......"`
`As Krauss watched Nanjo calm Kinzo down,`
` he began to wonder why this doctor wasn't his mother.`
`Well, it was always like this.`
`He always makes a fuss when no one's looking, but when the time comes, he makes his decision with pride.`
`After asking Nanjo to come down by lunch at the latest, Krauss snuck out of the study...`
`"What do you think? A splendid aroma, is it not?!`
` And a unique one, as well!"`
`"I've never had pumpkin tea before...`
` That little touch of sweetness makes it delicious."`
`Before serving the tea to the guests, Gohda served some to Shannon.`
`Until then, Shannon had thought it would be outrageous for a servant such as herself to drink the same thing as the family and their guests.`
`However, according to Gohda, that kind of thinking was a mistake.`
`"One must not serve something if one does not know the taste beforehand.`
` ......For example, when you visit a restaurant,`
` what are you likely to ask the waiter if a dish you've never heard of catches your eye?`
` "How does this dish taste", correct?"`
`"I see...`
` If the waiter says that he's never tried it, that would seem a bit odd......"`
`"Precisely.`
` As a matter of course, anyone serving their customers must be deeply acquainted with the taste of the tea and food they serve."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` And you'll always feel happier serving a sort of tea that you've tried and enjoyed for yourself."`
`"That's right.`
` After tasting tea this delicious, I can't wait to let everyone else try it."`
`"And because of that!`
` We servants must be very familiar with the tastes of all sorts of foods.`
` So if you ever catch me stealing a little nibble, that's all part of my job description... Hoh‐hoh‐ho."`
`"It's both a perk and a part of the job.`
` Do you understand?"`
`"Yes!"`
`"......Everything is proceeding smoothly.`
` Are there any problems with the tea?"`
`"Oh, Genji‐san, you must try some as well.`
` Seeing as it's almost Halloween, I decided to make some pumpkin tea."`
`"Later, perhaps.`
` The family will be arriving at the mansion very soon.`
` ......It looks as though the children will be with them."`
`"Yes sir.`
` The cups are ready to go as well."`
`At that moment, the kitchen's extension line started to ring.`
`Genji, who was standing right beside it, swiftly picked up the receiver before the second ring.`
`Shannon and the others always thought Genji looked like a samurai when he did this.`
`"......OK.`
` Take care when guiding them."`
`After making that short response, Genji set the receiver down.`
`"That was Kanon.`
` The relatives will be here shortly.`
` The children are with them.`
` Shannon, Kumasawa, go to serve them.`
` Gohda, hurry up with that tea."`
`"""Right away!"""`
`The family conference—the largest event of the year for the servants.`
` Their morale was high, and they were all full of determination to make it through another year by banding together.`
`"Pardon the interruption.`
` The relatives are here."`
`"Oho, you made it.`
` Did you have any difficulties en route?"`
`"Nii‐san, you've been doing pretty well for yourself lately, haven't you?`
` Isn't it about time you bought a private jet?"`
`"Wahahahaha.`
` It was another flight with only us Ushiromiyas on board!"`
`"Ange‐chan,`
` isn't it lucky that you could come?`
` I was so worried when I heard that you might be too sick to make it today."`
`"Thanks for your concern.`
` She suddenly got all better this morning."`
`"My tummy ache went away!`
` I rubbed my tummy clockwise!"`
`"Uu‐uu!`
` That's a magic charm to heal tummy aches!"`
`"Now, Maria, quiet down..."`
`"Oh, is that Battler‐kun...?!`
` You've grown so big!"`
`"It's been six years, hasn't it?`
` You've grown splendidly."`
`"Well, ......ihihi.`
` I do keep getting bigger, at least..."`
`"Can't really say that about his guts though!"`
`"Yep, it's nice to know he's still the same old Battler‐kun."`
`Everyone laughed.`
` No matter how big his body grew, Battler would always be Battler.`
`"This brat's always been terrified of falling off planes and boats and stuff."`
`"Would that be Asumu‐san's blood?"`
`"I'm pretty sure I know what did it.`
` It's probably because we made him ride all those wild rides in amusement parks when he was little."`
`"Aren't there height restrictions to stop children from riding those things?"`
`"Ah, no, not those.`
` I'm talking about teacup rides, paddle boats, all that kind of stuff, you know?`
` Looks like we took those a bit too rough back in the day."`
`"You've always gone a bit overboard on rides like that, Rudolf nii‐san."`
`"Oh, dear, I see......`
` Poor Battler‐kun."`
`"Haha, poor Battler‐kun indeed."`
`"Still, it's comforting, in a way.`
` That fear of riding things shows he's still the Battler‐kun we all know so well."`
`"Onii‐chan isn't scared of riding things.`
` He's scared of falling off them!"`
`"Gonna faaall, gonna faaall!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Hey, stop running around...!`
` Maria! You're one of the big cousins now, right?`
` Be a good example!"`
`"Pardon me.`
` I've brought some tea for everyone."`
`A pleasant aroma followed Shannon as she came into the room pushing a serving cart.`
`Even Ange and Maria, who had been running around in circles, sat down obediently when they heard that drinks were here.`
`"By the way, what's Dad doing?"`
`"He should be down here soon.`
` He's been rushing about all morning trying to choose a tie."`
`"You mean, all that about choosing an attire suitable for the family head?"`
`"Father's always been picky about ties, hasn't he?"`
`"It's just something he has a passion for.`
` Staying stylish is a good thing."`
`"And yet, he always shows up wearing the same tie in the end."`
`The family members burst out laughing.`
`The sweet scent of Gohda's specially made pumpkin tea spread throughout the parlor, and the calm atmosphere grew more cheery and excited.`
`"Look, Mama! Look, Mama!`
` It's a pumpkin cookie! For Halloween!!"`
`"Oh, that's right.`
` This sweet scent is kabocha, isn't it?"`
`"That's right.`
` Today, we have some special pumpkin‐flavored tea for you to try.`
` It really is delicious, so I suggest you try some without sugar first."`
`"Nee‐san, your sleeve.`
` Be careful."`
`"Wow,`
` I've never even heard of something like kabocha tea...`
` How does Gohda‐san find this stuff?"`
`"Delicious.`
` This is excellent.`
` You can taste the kabocha's natural sweetness."`
`"Kabocha tea, huh?`
` Still, kabocha always tastes best in tempura!"`
`"Uu!`
` It's not "kabocha", it's "pumpkin"!"`
`"Yeah, pumpkin is different from kabocha!`
` This is pumpkin!"`
`Maria seemed to be complaining about the difference of nuance between the Japanese and English words,`
` but it looked like Ange thought kabocha and pumpkins were entirely different things.`
`Everyone laughed, but Ange cocked her head to one side discontentedly, not understanding what was so funny.`
`Just when it looked like she was about to get in a bad mood and start grumbling, Maria started teaching her a "cookie game", and Ange immediately became engrossed with that distraction.`
`Then, the clomping sound of approaching heavy footsteps could be heard from the hallway.`
`Having a pretty good idea of whose footsteps they were, the relatives straightened their backs.`
`Those quick footsteps stopped for a moment just outside the parlor door.`
`......As though someone was taking a deep breath and setting up a dramatic pause.`
`Then, as the door exploded open, Kinzo—with Genji and Nanjo standing behind him—yelled out loud.`
`"<Hhhhhhappy Halloween!!`
` And trick or tree{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aat!!>"`
`"""<Trick‐or‐treeeeat>!!"""`
`The cousins shouted it back.`
`{n}The adults returned the greeting too, looking a little embarrassed.`
`Ange alone stood there with her mouth open,`
` unable to comprehend what had just happened.`
`"Welcome, my grandchildren!!`
` If you don't give me a treat, I shall prank you!!"`
`"Go ahead, Maria."`
`"Happy Halloween, Grandfather!!`
` I got you a really incredible one this year! You'll be surprised!!"`
`Maria picked up a present that had been hidden behind a sofa.`
`All of the other relatives were suddenly holding similar packages as well.`
`"Come on, Ange, you too.`
` Give this to Grandfather."`
`Kyrie handed Ange a neatly wrapped present.`
`"Ooooooh, Mariaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa, you're always so thoughtfu{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}ul!!`
` Grandpa's so happyy{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}yyy!!"`
`As Kinzo took Maria's present, a smile broke out across his face, and he rubbed his cheek up against it.`
`".........Master.`
` Your dignity."`
`"Nngg...o‐oh, that's right.`
` ......You have pleased your grandfather greatly, Maria.`
` In return for the treat you have given me, I promise not to prank you this year."`
`"Now it's your turn, Grandfather!!`
` If you don't give me a treat, I'll prank you!!"`
`"Yes, splendid.`
` Genji...!"`
`"Here."`
`Genji fished through something that looked like Santa Claus's sack and pulled out a present addressed to Maria,`
` handing it over to Kinzo.`
`"Heeere you go, Maria~!!`
` Here's a present from your grandpa!!`
` I'm warning yoooou, it's verr{-}r{-}r{-}r{-}rry cuu{-}u{-}u{-}ute!!`
` It's almost a waste to give it up to you{p:0:♪}"`
`".........Master. Dignity."`
`"Nnngggyyyyhhhh...`
` Th‐this is a present from the Ushiromiya family head to Maria...`
` It is a...cute......nnnggg, *cough*cough*...`
`a‐an item worthy of the Ushiromiya family's dignity and grace.`
` T‐take good care of it......"`
`"Thank you, Grandfather!!`
` I love you!!`
` Kiss‐kiss‐kiss!"`
`"N‐nngggwoooooooohhhhh...!!`
` Ooohhh, Mariaa{-}a{-}a{-}aaa, my cute little granddaughter!!`
` Kissie kissie kissieee~~~~~!!!"`
`"........................"`
`By this point, even Genji had to give up on Kinzo's dignity.`
`Still, the dignity of the family head had lasted a full ten seconds longer than usual this year.`
`"Happy Halloween, Grandfather.`
` This is from me."`
`"Happy Halloween. This one's mine.`
` I hope you like it."`
`"Oooooh, George, Jessica,`
` I thank you for yet another year.`
` I'm, ......I'm so happy..."`
`With tears streaming down his face, Kinzo hugged George and Jessica.`
`"Oh, and Battler too.`
` ......I'm so glad you've returned to the family.`
` ......It's been lonely without you, these past six years..."`
`"......Well, ......um, anyway...`
` .........Happy Halloween.`
` Not sure if you'll like it though..."`
`"Don't worry...... Don't worry, Battler......`
` I know you have things you want to say, things you want to ask.`
` ......But now is not the time."`
`"Grandfather......"`
`"I am......glad that you have returned to the Ushiromiya family......`
` ......It makes me feel......happy......"`
`Slowly, ......Kinzo moved forward and hugged Battler.`
`Battler drew back at first, but he then understood Kinzo's feelings and hugged him back.`
`Ange watched this scene play out......shocked.`
`Was Ushiromiya Kinzo............always this kind of person......?`
`"Ange.`
` You're up."`
`"Go on, give it to Grandfather."`
`"............Ah, .........okay."`
`Ange......didn't have a clue what was going on.`
`She took the present her mother had given her......and walked forward timidly.`
`......Kinzo's face, which had been looking so cheery a second ago,`
` seemed to become much sterner the moment Ange stepped forward.`
`No, it hadn't "become" stern.`
`That expression.........was the one always worn by the Kinzo inside Ange's mind.`
`This {i:was} Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
`He was fickle, short‐tempered, always with a stern expression on his face.`
` ......The most terrifying person in the Ushiromiya family...`
`"..........................."`
`"................................."`
`It felt as though the world had gone suddenly quiet, and it had only done it when it was my turn to step forward.`
`......Why?`
` Why only for me?`
`But, even so, ......isn't this the way it should be?`
`{n}Isn't this the Ushiromiya Kinzo I expect? ...The Ushiromiya Kinzo I understand......?`
`I was like a puppet carrying tea.`
`{n}I walked forward, bewildered, with the present held out in front of me, ......and stopped in front of Kinzo.`
`Without letting his expression change in the slightest,`
` Kinzo slowly reached out and touched the present......`
`"MmmmmAAAAAaaannnggeeee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eee!!!"`
`In an instant, Ange was caught in a firm embrace, present and all.`
`{n}Kinzo's white beard rubbed against her cheek.`
`"Grandpa......Grandpa is so happyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!`
` I'm so glad to be blessed with such lovely grandchildren!!`
` I feel happyyyyyyy!!`
` So happy the tears just won't...just won't stooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oop!!"`
`".........Master, your nose is running.`
` ......That...and your dignity."`
`"Oh, Genji, forgive me!!`
` I...alwa{0}n{0}t{0}h{0}f{0}n{0}h{0}h{0}h{0}hnnn...`
` *honkkkk*!!"`
`As the old man blew his nose, he didn't look like he could possibly be anyone other than a kindly grandpa overcome with tears at his grandchildren's gifts.`
`"Thank you, Ange.`
` I heard that you chose to come even though you weren't feeling well at all...`
` I'm so glad...!`
` Here, this is for you."`
`He pressed a large gift box to Ange's chest.`
`......She finally realized that all of the presents given out by Kinzo were wrapped differently and in boxes of different sizes.`
`"I wonder what he got you, Ange.`
` I hear that Grandfather always personally chooses what he'll give each one of us.`
` Pretty incredible, with all these people."`
`".........Every year...`
` ......He picks them himself...`
` ............"`
`He does...`
`what every year?`
`{n}He picks...`
`...what himself?`
`This bizarre ceremony happens......every year.`
`The cousins were all happily chattering about what their Halloween presents would be this year.`
`Maria came up to Ange and suggested that they compare the weights of their presents,`
` but for some reason, Ange just stared blankly.`
`After that, the adults also handed their presents to Kinzo one by one,`
` receiving a gift in return, along with considerate words about their health and questions about how they'd been doing recently.`
`Then, after watching to see that all exchanges had been completed, Gohda appeared...`
` and announced that lunch was ready.`
`"So, it is ready...!`
` Come, ladies and gentlemen!`
` Let us enjoy the splendid lunch that Gohda has prepared for us.`
` Quickly, to the dining hall!"`
`"This way, everyone.`
` Follow me."`
`"We will carry your presents to your rooms in the guesthouse."`
`"Please, feel free to leave them here as you leave for lunch."`
`The relatives stood up, leaving their presents where they lay on tables and sofas, and followed Kinzo out of the parlor.`
`......Only Ange remained standing there, stunned,`
` ......as she clutched the gift box Kinzo had given her...`
`Never once had Gohda's lunches betrayed expectations.`
`When Hideyoshi said that the lunches were the only reason anyone ever came to these family conferences, everyone laughed and nodded.`
`Delicious food has a way of keeping conversation flowing.`
`You've gotten so tall.`
` How have you been lately?`
` Oh, you know, not bad.`
`It was a fun meal, with everyone asking each other about the latest and laughing together.`
`The Ushiromiya family sat at meals in a specific ranked seating order,`
` so the adult siblings, the cousins, and the spouses all sat in groups.`
`That made it even easier for conversation to flow smoothly.`
`Ange had withdrawn slightly from the cousins' chat and was looking around the dining hall.`
`......What are Kinzo and the adult siblings doing?`
`Their conversation seemed to be peaceful and fun.`
`Most of the time, the siblings were mothers or fathers of their own households.`
`However, when they gathered together by themselves in front of Kinzo, that burden was lifted from their shoulders,`
` and they became young and bright as though they'd gone back to being kids again.`
`Rudolf, who was usually an easygoing father but one with a sense of dignity,`
` became so bright and cheery in this group that it almost looked like there was another Battler.`
`Even Kinzo looked peaceful and relaxed.`
`He didn't say a word about money or the inheritance.`
`In fact, he didn't even insult his children or call them incompetent.`
`He just looked like a happy old man, genuinely pleased to have his whole family together for the only time this year.`
`The group of spouses was just as harmonious.`
`Their conversation jumped from topic to topic on motherly issues like their children's education, the running of the household, and family health.`
`Hideyoshi and even Nanjo happily joined in.`
`And what about the cousins?`
`......There was no way that such a fun dinner table with such a fun group of friends could fail to be raucous.`
`Maria was in her element, showing off her knowledge of Halloween trivia.`
`George and Jessica would nod in understanding, Battler would say something stupid, and Maria would laugh at him.`
`If I wanted, I could easily join in on the conversation,`
` and I could easily slip out of it too by shifting my attention to the dessert.`
`It was......happiness, both fun and natural.`
`......It felt like I was enjoying a pleasant doze in the rays of the springtime sun.`
`"According to the weather report, we can expect a big storm sometime tonight."`
`"It's supposed to be a typhoon.`
` Looks like we'll be stuck here for more than one night again."`
`"I do not mind in the least. You may stay here as long as you wish.`
` If it would mean seeing the faces of my precious grandchildren more often, I would pray for rain every day."`
`"Give us a break. We do have work to worry about."`
`"Why don't you leave the island, Father?`
` That way, you could see your grandchildren whenever you wanted."`
`"Hahhahaha, true.`
` Living on a remote island may have a sense of majesty, but haven't you had enough of it?"`
`"......It's too noisy in the city.`
` I much prefer a quiet island, with no one on it but my family.`
` I like it here."`
`"But on Rokkenjima, if something happens, it would take some time for a doctor to arrive."`
`"I agree.`
` At your age, I think you should at least consider moving to Niijima."`
`"......Yes, I am old.`
` I want to live in peace, surrounded only by my family.`
` ......And I am satisfied.`
` I have this island to make that dream of mine come true."`
`"Father......"`
`"Hmm......`
` It seems I've gotten you all down.`
` Ladies and gentlemen, Gohda's lunch is now complete.`
` Grandchildren, it will probably be raining constantly starting tomorrow.`
` Now is the only time that you'll have clear skies.`
` Why not go to enjoy the roses and then take a walk on the beach?"`
`"That sounds good.`
` Okay, everyone.`
` Want to go?"`
`"Uu!`
` I wanna see the roses and walk on the beach!`
` We can collect shells, and collect glass too!"`
`"Collect glass?`
` That, uh, sounds a bit dangerous...!"`
`"Fragments of glass get washed by the waves and become round, beautiful gems, which drift to shore.`
` Did you forget, Battler?`
` Remember how we used to pick them up together?"`
`"Oh...... Were those pieces of glass?`
` I always thought they were just pretty gems."`
`"Have you ever seen a glass gem, Ange?!"`
`"......No."`
`"Then let's go!!`
` I'll show you!!`
` Let's go, let's go!`
` But the first to see them gets them!`
` I'm gonna get them all!"`
