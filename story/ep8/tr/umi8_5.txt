`I became the Halloween party princess,`
` and the tournament of quizzes and riddles just for me began.`
`It looks like I get a medal for each puzzle I get right.`
`If I get a lot, I'm supposed to get a wonderful prize from Grandfather.`
`Okay, here I go.`
`"Who should I start with?"`
`"I don't think it matters.`
` Start with whomever you like."`
`"I'd better think up a killer puzzle while I have the chance."`
`"Maria, didn't you have a quiz book in your bag?"`
`"Uu! I do!`
` Kihihihihihi, I'm gonna bully Ange with a mean one...!"`
`Maria onee‐chan laughed with an evil smile.`
`Looks like everyone's going to try and bully me.`
` I'm sure they'll think up some really hard questions.`
`"Don't worry, I'll lend a hand."`
`"Really...?"`
`"Of course.`
` After all, I'm the princess's attendant.`
` So, let's give it our all together and get a huge pile of medals."`
`"Okay...!"`
`"Come now, Ange‐sama.`
` Start wherever you want.`
` I, Gohda, am ready to challenge you whenever you please."`
`"Whoa, not so fast.`
` The honor of the first audience with the princess belongs to me.`
` Ange, begin with my challenge...!"`
`"O‐okay!"`
`I suddenly got tense, and my stomach began to feel tight.`
`Then, Auntie Eva gently held my hand.`
`"It'll be alright.`
` Let's do this together!"`
`"O‐......okay!"`
`"Then let us begin, Ange.`
` This is a story about December 25th, Christmas Day."`
`"Christmas...?"`
`Even though it was October, he suddenly started talking about Christmas.`
`{n}Is he going to ask what day Christmas is?`
`I know that.`
` It's December 25th.`
`"On Christmas Day,`
` a woman looked up at the night sky and said,`
` "Eventually, the night will end, and morning will come.`
` Wouldn't it be wonderful if, after the sun sinks and it becomes night once more, it could be Christmas again?"`
` Then, the man beside her said,`
` "Okay,`
` I'll make your dream come true for you."`
` Is such a thing possible...?"`
`"The day after Christmas is the 26th, a normal day.`
` That's impossible."`
`"...Still Christmas, even after the sun rises......`
` Oh, I've got it."`
`"Huh? How?!`
` How can the day after Christmas be Christmas again?!"`
`"Wahhahahahaha.`
` Think about it for yourself, Ange."`
