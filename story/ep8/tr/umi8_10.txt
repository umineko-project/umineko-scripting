`"Somebodyyyyyyyyy!!`
` Is anyone there?!`
` Onii‐chaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}an!!`
` Waaaaaahh!!"`
`Ange flew out of the guesthouse, sobbing.`
`Was there anyone still alive on this island?`
`When she checked the cousins' room earlier, it had been completely empty.`
`However, she remembered that she hadn't seen Battler's body, or George's, or Maria's.`
`What she didn't know was whether this meant they were safe...or whether she was about to be reunited with them as corpses.`
`"Where are you guys?!`
` Where aaaare youuuuu?!!`
` Answer meee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eee!!"`
`She dashed around through the rain.`
`Where was she going?`
` Nowhere in particular.`
`The lost little sister dashed around in circles, searching for her brother.`
`Drenched with rain and all alone......`
`.........Eventually, I thought I heard my brother's voice from beyond a bush.`
`No, it wasn't just his voice.`
` I heard George onii‐chan's and Maria onee‐chan's voices too.`
`I called out at the top of my lungs, but they didn't answer.`
`But it's okay now.`
` They're right there.`
` Just on the other side of the fence.`
`I could even faintly see them through the fence.`
`When I ran around the fence, I found myself standing in front of a shed or something.`
`It must be a shed to store tools for the rose garden.`
`The three of them were standing in front of the shed.`
`"Onii‐chan...!!"`
`I cried out, but my voice didn't reach them.`
`{n}Even though I yelled so loudly?`
`Something felt very wrong about all this.`
`......When people hear a voice, even when they pretend not to have heard it, their bodies tend to show some sign that they've noticed.`
`However, there was no trace of that in the three of them.`
`Even though I was screaming so loud, .........it truly wasn't reaching their ears.`
`The instant I understood that, ......my dash towards them slowed and came to a halt.`
`Though we appeared to be in the same world, .........we were actually in different worlds entirely.`
`It was like a TV.`
` Or was it more like ghosts...?`
`I could see them clearly, ......but as far as they were concerned, I didn't exist.`
`......After all, look.`
`Even if I stand right in front of them, ......their eyes can't see me.`
`If I try and touch them, will I really be able to?`
` ......What if my hand just goes right through...`
`I was so scared at the thought......that I could do nothing but stand there in shock, even though I was so close to them...`
`"Dammit...!!`
` I don't have a clue anymore...!`
` Someone must have snuck in from outside the island after all!!`
` And that person massacred the Ushiromiya family!"`
`"......No matter how much we lock ourselves in, someone always gets killed.`
` ......Uu! It's the work of a witch after all!"`
`"Everyone, calm down...!`
` Let's calm down and think.`
` ......No one exists on this island except those with a direct relation to the Ushiromiya family."`
`"That doesn't make sense...!`
` After all, we've just seen several murders that'd be impossible for any one of us!"`
`"......Well, that's true......`
` But is it really?`
` Maybe we've just missed something."`
`"Missed something?"`
`"For example......`
` .........That's right, maybe someone was playing dead!`
` Since we're the only ones on this island, the culprit must be one of us.`
` That would mean that someone we thought was dead was actually faking...!"`
`"But Aniki, that's impossible!`
` Every one of the corpses was checked by someone!`
` There's no way any of them were faking!"`
`"I don't want to think about it,`
` ...but what if those corpse inspections......were also faked?"`
`".........Uu...?"`
`"What I'm getting at is this.`
` There were multiple culprits from the start.`
` One plays dead, and the other lies and confirms that the first culprit died.`
` Then, the culprit who played dead keeps on committing crimes,`
` creating the illusion that some stranger has snuck onto the island...!"`
`"Do you......still suspect someone in the Ushiromiya family of being the culprit?!"`
`".........Doctor Nanjo was killed.`
` ......Since he was killed, it's probably safe to say that he wasn't a culprit.`
` And, we can consider the examinations performed by a doctor like him to be the most reliable."`
`If so, then we can probably assume that the people whose death Nanjo checked were almost certainly dead.`
`Who did Nanjo check?`
`Genji's corpse.`
`{n}Krauss and Natsuhi's corpses.`
`{n}Shannon's corpse.`
`{n}Gohda and Kumasawa's corpses.`
`"Think back to the beginning and the bodies in the dining hall.`
` Of those six victims, Doctor Nanjo only inspected Genji‐san."`
`"......But didn't the rest of us check the others?"`
`"Yes, but Doctor Nanjo didn't actually inspect them himself."`
`"What are you talking about?!`
` How the hell could our parents have survived after being killed like that?!"`
`"Anyway, what do you think you're saying, George‐aniki?!`
` Wouldn't that mean one of our parents is the culprit?!`
` That's insane!!"`
`"They were killed right at the beginning, and so many of them...!`
` How can you go calling our parents culprits on top of that?!`
` I won't let anyone, not even you, suspect and slander our parents after they've been killed like that...!!"`
`".........S‐.........sorry......"`
`"......I know my Mama was really dead.`
` So, does that mean George onii‐chan's parents or Battler's parents were the culprits?"`
`"Let's stop with that, Maria‐chan......`
` I must have lost it a bit just now..."`
`"George onii‐chan wouldn't kill Shannon."`
`"That's enough...!`
` None of us would kill our family, right?!!"`
`"So, I don't think George onii‐chan would lie and say his parents were dead, not if they were really alive.`
` .........There's no way you would help out in a crime if Shannon was going to be killed."`
`Calmly, ......as though answering a quiz or a puzzle, Maria spoke to George.`
`Then, with a blank look on her face, she turned to Battler and spoke.`
`".........Battler, you saw your mom and dad's corpses, right?"`
`"Yeah, I saw them!!`
` We all saw them right?!`
` Those pitiful, blood‐stained......!!"`
`"I think you're lying."`
`"Huh?!`
` Where the hell did that come from?!!"`
`"Because that way, it all makes sense.`
` ......Back in the dining hall, your parents weren't dead.`
` One of them killed Aunt Natsuhi and Uncle Krauss, locked the door from the inside, and waited in that room.`
` ......The other one took over the murders after that."`
`"......To break open the locked room of the guesthouse, they needed to have an accomplice inside.`
` That was you.`
` ......That explains everything."`
`"E‐enooooooooooooough!!!"`
`"S‐stop it, Battler‐kun...!`
` You too, Maria‐chan...!"`
`"Finally, all the pieces fit together in the Wolves and Sheep puzzle in my head.`
` .........The culprits are Battler's family.`
` Uu.`
` ......Am I right?"`
`"Wh‐what are you talking abooooooooout?!!!"`
`{a:c:`
`"Correct."}`
`The voice came from behind Ange.`
` She spun around, surprised.`
`......There, covered in blood, ......yet wearing cheery expressions, ......were Rudolf and Kyrie.`
`"Uncle Rudolf, Auntie Kyrie, .........I, I'm so glad you're sa—"`
`After saying that much, George realized what the words meant, and his face twisted into an expression of shock and horror.`
`Maria wasn't surprised.`
` However, she showed no joy at having her answer proven correct.`
`And as for Battler...`
`......Ange...saw it.`
`A terrible expression...that she would never forget as long as she lived.`
`It was...a demon's smile.`
`A hideous demon that she'd never be able to look at again twisted its face in a foul grin, and the truly horrible thing was...`
`...that she saw it......on her brother's face......`
`Rudolf and Kyrie lifted up the guns they had been holding behind them.`
`The barrels were pointed at the foreheads of George, who was staggering backwards, and Maria, who was grinning as though she didn't care what happened.`
`There was a flash of lightning and a crack of thunder.`
` Nothing more could be heard.`
`Then, as George and Maria were snapped around by that roar, ......the strings holding them were snipped.`
`The two dolls fell into puddles with a splash...and stopped moving......`
`"......D‐......Dad... ......Mom........."`
`All of this occurred right before Ange's eyes...`
`"Heh...ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"`
`"Eheheheheheh, haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"`
`"Ihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"`
`Ange, who stood stunned beside them, wasn't visible to their eyes.`
`They guffawed, overcome with laughter.`
` Then, right in front of Ange, they started joking and complimenting each other on their kills so far.`
`The three hideous faces......the faces of her family......made Ange want to cry and vomit at the same time, and she felt as though she would suffocate.`
`Ange dashed away, covering her mouth.`
`She wanted to escape the disgusting laughter coming from her beloved family as soon as possible.`
`Then, she slipped and fell face‐down in a puddle of mud.`
`Ange didn't try to get up.`
`In fact, she instead chose to cover her ears to block out the disgusting laughter that she could still hear.`
`As she did, .........from the shadows of the fences and bushes in this inky‐black rose garden, ......several dark things slipped into sight.`
`"...............?!?!"`
`Ange looked around herself in surprise.........to see that eerie black shapes had appeared from all over the garden...and were slowly surrounding her.`
`It was.........a crowd of people with goat heads.`
`Their outfits were all different.`
`Some wore suits, while others were dressed casually.`
` However, all of them were covered with darkness, and all of them had goat heads.`
`Ange, bewildered, accidentally let her hands fall from her ears.`
`By now, she couldn't hear that disgusting laughter.`
`However, in its place, ......she could hear the words spoken by the goats.`
`‘............Kyrie and Rudolf are the culprits.’`
`‘Battler is the culprit...... Battler is the culprit......’`
`‘......Battler culprit theory.`
` Battler's family culprit theory......’`
`As the goats continued to mumble in eerie voices, ......they surrounded Ange and began to draw nearer.`
`They all pressed around her, each of them speaking of Ange's family as the culprits......`
`.........At first, everyone had joined in on the Eva culprit theory.`
`The sole survivor from Rokkenjima had gotten almost all of the wealth to herself, so the theory was only natural.`
`Why was Ushiromiya Eva the only one who escaped to Kuwadorian?`
` And why did she refuse so stubbornly to talk about what happened that day?`
`It was decided that the Eva culprit theory explained all of this.`
`However, when Eva died of illness, and people learned that all the vast wealth she had created by unscrupulous means would go to Ange,`
` public opinion—or rather, the Forgers—created a new culprit theory and spread it around.`
`This was.........the "Rudolf's family culprit theory".`
`If it was normal for everyone to come to the family conferences, why was Ange the only one who didn't come this time?`
`Did Rudolf's family have some reason for not bringing the young Ange with them?`
`They did take Battler, but he wasn't Kyrie's son.`
`Then, when it was revealed in some magazines that Kyrie's family had close ties to a massive gangster organization, all eyes suddenly gathered on Kyrie herself.`
`Then, the truth was also laid bare about how Rudolf had made a killing out of fraudulent business practices,`
` and almost immediately, the couple became thought of as the most suspicious people on the island.`
`Hideyoshi and Eva's company might have been rough, but at least it had operated within the law.`
`However, the more Rudolf's company was investigated, the more dirt was dug up.`
`Furthermore, trouble surrounding some party tickets from the time Rudolf and Kyrie were students was also testified to.`
` It was clear that they were far more suspicious than Eva's family.`
`And so, in a flash,`
` ......the "Rudolf's family culprit theory" expelled the other conspiracy theories, including the Eva culprit theory, and reigned as the greatest of them all.`
`......It wasn't really because it was more plausible than the Eva culprit theory.`
`They had just gotten bored of the old theory and wanted a new sensation......`
`The goats seemed to bend and undulate.`
`The sky rapidly turned white, ......becoming a ceiling lit by fluorescent lamps.`
`The goats had changed completely, .........becoming the shapes of girls......wearing goat masks.`
`All of the girls were wearing the same clothes.`
`It was a uniform.`
` ......The uniform of Saint Lucia Academy.`
`‘......Did you hear the real culprits were Rudolf and Kyrie?’`
`‘Oh, I heard that!`
` Yeah, I knew there was something suspicious about them leaving their kid behind!’`
`‘Didn't Ushiromiya Eva say herself that she was being poisoned to death?!`
` Isn't it obvious who was behind that?!’`
`‘Must be nice for her. She gets her whole family's riches all to herself, right?’`
`‘I always knew the "Rudolf's family culprit theory" was right!’`
`‘I always thought there was something strange about Ushiromiya‐san!’`
`‘We always thought she was weird, *snicker*snicker*.’`
`‘*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*.’`
`‘Rudolf and Kyrie did it.’`
`‘Wasn't Battler part of it too?’`
`‘Rudolf's family culprit theory!’`
`‘Rudolf and Kyrie were the culprits!’`
`‘They tried to get the family wealth all to themselves, but they failed at the hands of Eva—’`
`‘But in the end, Ushiromiya Ange gets everything anyway, doesn't she?’`
`‘Rudolf and Kyrie are the culprits, of course!’`
`‘Rudolf's family culprit theory!’`
`‘Rudolf and Kyrie and Battler did it!’`
`‘Rudolf and Kyrie and Battler did it!!’`
`‘They're saying your family did it, Ushiromiya‐san!’`
`‘What do you think of that?`
` Come on, tell us!’`
`‘But in the end, you get all the family wealth to yourself, don't you?!’`
`‘Even at the end, Ushiromiya Eva never told you anything, right?!’`
`‘I always knew there was something wrong with that girl!’`
`‘This also explains why Eva hated you so much!’`
`‘Hey, hey, say something, tell us what you think!’`
`‘She really is a creepy kid, isn't she?’`
`‘At least say something about what you think of the theory, you sicko!!’`
`A blade of air swept over me as I crouched down, holding my head.`
`In a flash, the illusion of the goat‐headed girl students who were surrounding me shattered.`
`......I was curled up in a puddle in the rainy rose garden, surrounded by goats.`
`But then, those goats were also sliced in half, and the upper halves slid to the side.`
`It was like seeing a master swordsman slicing through a stick of bamboo.`
`{a:c:`
`"This way......!"}`
`The voice came from......that black cat.`
`{n}The black cat with the bell that had guided me here.`
`Incredible that it can talk......`
`{n}But that doesn't matter now.`
` I dashed after it.`
`The goats shrank back.`
`A hole opened up in the encirclement.`
` The black cat dashed through it.`
`As I hurried through after it, the goats began to chase after me.`
`Countless heavy footsteps thundered behind us.`
`"Wh‐......where are we running to, {nobr:Mr. Cat}...?!"`
`The cat ignored my stupid question.`
`Where are we running to?`
`{n}It's obvious.`
` As far away as we can make it.`
`However, there were an unbelievable number of goats.`
`It wasn't just the group chasing us.`
` There were probably goats hiding throughout the rose garden, and everywhere we went, a group of them would appear and block our path.`
`Each time we bumped into them, we ran down a different path in this maze of a rose garden.`
`So, I didn't even know which direction we were running in anymore.`
`It couldn't be that we're......just running around in circles inside a massive crowd of goats, could it...?`
`When we ran into the arbor once more, I learned that my fears were justified.`
`The four paths that led from the arbor were all blocked by a crowd of goats.`
`{n}Of course, the path we had come down was also blocked by our pursuers.`
`There was nowhere to go to, nowhere to return to.`
` ......We were finally...trapped......`
`"M‐Mr. Cat, ......what should we do? W‐we're surrounded......!!"`
`"........................"`
`With a defensive posture, the black cat glared at the goats that surrounded us.`
`It's...all over for us......`
`At that moment, I found myself floating in the air.`
`A massive arm, large enough to crush my entire head, had grabbed my collar from behind.`
`Before I could even think to cry out, ......I saw, right in front of my face, a pair of strangely glowing red eyes, and a massive mouth with jagged teeth and a foul breath.`
`The mouth......opened wide...`
`...and, writhing as though it was a separate creature, ......a disturbing tongue stuck itself out.`
`Then, ......it spat words at me.`
`‘.........Rudolf, Kyrie, and Battler are the culprits......`
` ......Rudolf and Kyrie played dead, and Battler lied when he inspected them......`
` Then, one of the parents carried out the murders until the second twilight and hid under the bed in Natsuhi's room.`
` ......Battler killed Shannon, and then assisted in the murders in the guesthouse.`
` ......The other parent carried out the guesthouse murders......`
` This is......the truth............’`
`Then, ......that gaping, smelly mouth......slowly began to close over Ange's head......`
`"Counter.`
` ......{p:2:It's possible to form a logical theory other than the "Rudolf's family culprit theory".}"`
`A blue flash......sliced off the top of the mouth that was trying to eat Ange's head, sending it flying.`
`I fell into a puddle, along with the goat that was still grasping my collar, though there was nothing left of it above its jaw.`
`Without any hesitation, ......the goats stretched out their thick arms, as though this was their chance to snatch this prey for themselves...and they rushed towards me.`
` All of them spoke in unison.`
`‘{p:2:Everything except the Rudolf's family culprit theory is impossibllle...`
` ......Absolutely impossibllle}...!!’`
`"{p:1:It's possible to form a logical theory other than the Rudolf's family culprit theory}.`
` {p:2:For example, a theory with George's family as the culprits is possible}."`
`A red flash and a blue line became blades of wind that passed over my head,`
` flew at the goat that had tried to pick me up, and sliced both its arms off like a knife through butter.`
`I think the next goats dashed, not towards me, ......but towards the black cat that was protecting me from behind.`
`As I sat on my butt, staring up at the rainy night's sky,`
` ......the massive goats were in the air right above me, fighting the black cat...or someone.`
`‘{p:2:The "George's family culprit theory" is impossiiible!`
` George can't kill Shan{-}n{-}n{-}n{-}n{-}non!!`
` So he can't be a culprit, and he can't faaaake when checking corpses}!!!’`
`"{p:1:No, it is possible.`
` A "culprit" is defined as "one who murders".`
` It never says that they have to murder someone who appears in the story.`
` ......In other words,`
` if George committed murder outside the island sometime before this crime, he could be a "culprit" without killing anyone on the island, and it would be possible for him to lie}."`
`The deep‐red curves cut by the swings bit into the goat.`
`Its massive body was knocked into the air......became a bundle of roughly seven logs of flesh, and was thrown into the rose bushes.`
`This time, the terrible force of the attack shocked the goats.`
` They faltered, shook, stepped back.`
`......Finally, I understood.`
`That red slice.`
` ......It had come from a weapon that could draw red trails—no, it had also drawn blue trails just a second ago—`
`a massive scythe that could speak both types of truth, red and blue, at will.`
`I looked up at the sky, ......then let my head hang down backwards.`
`There was no black cat there.`
`It was a girl......holding a large scythe......`
`"How's that?`
` A deduction like this is trivial for Furudo Erika."`
`A stir passed through the crowd of goats as they acknowledged the presence of this girl who called herself Erika.`
`It was clear that her mere existence here was potent enough to unsettle them.`
`Clutching me in her arms, Erika leapt into the air and landed as light as a feather on top of the arbor.`
`Then, she let go of me and, still wielding her scythe, made an elegant curtsy to the crowd of goats surrounding us.`
`"This is probably the first time most of you have met me.`
` Allow me to introduce myself!`
` Hello and good day!`
` I'm Furudo Erika, the detective!"`
`"......Let's have the blockheads who can only think of the Rudolf's family culprit theory step down!`
` If anyone thinks they can counter my argument, please feel free!`
` Naturally, I welcome the challenge!!"`
`The goats all howled at once.`
` It seemed to be a cry of shock, of fear, or possibly of wonder.`
`The goats surrounded the arbor, chattering, but not moving any closer.`
`None of them had the courage to stand against this detective, this Witch of Truth called Furudo {f:5:Erika}...`
`"......Good grief.`
` All those thousands, and this is the best you can do?`
` None of you has the courage to fight Furudo Erika in a battle of words?"`
`"......Too bad.`
` Let's put an end to this.`
` Then again, I am the great Furudo Erika.`
` .........I don't have the time to waste on countering all you blockheads one by one.`
` I'll let her clean up the rest.`
` .........You're up!!"`
`When Erika cried out, red cracks opened in the dark night's sky.`
`They looked like the spiderweb‐shaped fissures that appear when a glass window has been struck hard.`
` ......No, it actually was a spiderweb, colored blood‐red.`
`"......*giggle*giggle*, ......kyaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha......!"`
`A laugh, ......a witch's laugh, rang out through the spiderweb‐covered world.`
` It sounded somehow familiar to Ange...`
`And there, ......standing above the spiderweb,`
` ......gazing down on the goats who must have looked like ensnared little bugs, was the witch.`
`"You forget me, .........and you call {i:him} the ruler of Rokkenjima......?`
` You forget me, and you think Rudolf is the culpriiiit...?`
` Kyahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!!"`
`It was the witch who lurked inside of Eva—a witch of the future, who would one day call herself an Endless Witch after the cat box closed over this world.`
`"Who dares speak of the murders of this island without involving {f:5:Eva Beatrice}?!`
` How impertinent!`
` On this island, who lives and who dies is totally up to me!!`
` All the wealth and gold is mine!!`
` Everything about October 4th and 5th in 1986 is mine to do with as I please!`
` It all belongs to me, {f:5:Eva Beatrice}!!"`
`{f:5:Eva} swung her one‐winged staff at the crowd of foolish goats beneath her and sentenced them to death.`
`The spiderweb ceiling covering the heavens plummeted, and more spiderwebs seeped out of the ground at the goats' feet.`
`Then, the webs from above and below met, and thousands upon thousands of goats were caught in their grasp.`
`Then, as {f:5:Eva} swung her staff, it swirled.`
` Around and around, like egg yolk being mixed in a bowl.`
`Eventually, it was all packed into a massive, blood‐red lump of goo.`
`The moans of goats drifted out from inside.`
`That entire crowd had been compressed into a meatball a few meters across.`
`"So, you morons doubt that I'm the culprit?!!"`
`"Reaching the Eva culprit theory and giving up there is good enough for the likes of you."`
`"Why don't you just get crushed and disappear fore{f:5:va}aa?!?!"`
`Squelch.`
`No other word could do that sound justice.`
`After sucking in all of those goats, the spider web ball vanished into thin air with a squelch.`
`After that, there wasn't even a trace left.`
`{n}Only the nighttime scenery of the rose garden remained, silent but for the sound of the falling rain......`
`{f:5:Eva} drifted down from the sky.`
`"Your aunt will always be on your side, Ange‐chan.`
` ......I'll never let anyone insult your family."`
`"A‐......Aunt Eva............"`
`I knew I should be grateful.`
`And yet, ......it really wasn't easy for me to believe that Aunt Eva was my ally.`
`{f:5:Eva} realized that too.`
`"Don't worry.`
` I'm not doing this because I want to be thanked.`
` But I'll always be on your side.`
` ......See you later."`
`She giggled, spun around, and vanished...`
`Now that she had already left, I started to regret not saying even a thank you...`
`So, ......I figured I should at least thank the other person who had saved me.`
`"......Thanks......for saving me...`
` Who......are you...?"`
`I already knew her name.`
`What I was really asking......was why she had saved me.`
`"I'm Furudo Erika, the detective.`
` .........And I'm also a witch."`
`"......A witch...?"`
`"A Witch of Truth.`
` ......A witch who searches for the Single Truth.`
` And......you're the same, aren't you?"`
`"..........................."`
`Those two days...October 4th and 5th, 1986.`
`I was so desperate to know what happened......that I took a step off the roof of that skyscraper,`
` ......drifted through several witch games and fragment worlds, and abandoned myself to this long journey with no rewards.`
`All I want......is to know what happened that day.`
`All I want......is the Single Truth of that day.`
`"Looking for something like that is what makes someone a Witch of Truth.`
` So, you're just the same as me.`
` ......That's why I came to save you."`
`"......I...want to know.`
` ......Just what happened on that day?`
` No one will tell me! No one knows...!`
` But I know something happened that day!"`
`"I'd give up anything to learn what that was...!`
` That's the one thing I need to know no matter what, even if it kills me...!`
` So tell me!`
` Do you know the answer?!`
` What happened on this island?!"`
`"......To a Witch of Truth,`
` is the truth something that is {i:given}?`
` If I told you that such‐and‐such was the truth, would you really just accept whatever I said...?"`
`"No, ......I wouldn't........."`
`"What did Battler‐san show you today?"`
`......Today, ............Onii‐chan showed me a bizarre Halloween party.`
`It may have been heart‐warming......and a lot of fun, but...`
`It definitely......wasn't the truth.`
`"Didn't Battler‐san show you that saying it was the truth?"`
`"It isn't.`
` ......That couldn't......be the truth!"`
`"Sometimes, other people will try to mislead us by claiming they know the truth.`
` ......But a real Witch of Truth must continue to pursue the Single Truth without being led astray.`
` That's why you can't accept the fake truth that Battler‐san's trying to force on you.`
` ......You care about finding the one real truth more than anything."`
`"..................Yeah..."`
`Onii‐chan......is trying to muddy the waters.`
`I've felt that this whole time.`
`Even though he knows everything about what happened that day, ......he won't tell me anything at all.`
`How is he any different from Aunt Eva,`
` who mocked me and refused to tell me anything, even until the very moment of her death?`
`......Why won't Onii‐chan tell me?`
`{n}..............................`
`"............Why...?"`
`"........................"`
`"Why......won't he tell me?!"`
`The dam inside my heart burst.`
`"Why won't Onii‐chan......tell me what really happened?!!`
` Why? Why...?!!`
` I'm the only one who doesn't know!!`
` No one's telling me the truth!!`
` Tell me!!`
` Tell me what happened that day, Onii‐chan!!`
` Onii‐chaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aan!!!"`
`I cried out at the rainy night sky.`
`Hot tears poured from my eyes, but they were covered by the cold rain that beat against me, so no one other than me would know that they were tears.`
`......No one would know my pain and sadness.`
`I'm.........always the only one left out......all alone......`
`"Someone, tell me!!!`
` Tell me what happened that day!!!"`
`"......No one can tell you.`
` .........After all, truth is something you can only grasp on your own."`
`"Where is the truth?!`
` How can I find it?!`
` Everyone's hiding it! They won't tell me!`
` I'll grasp it myself...!`
` So please, just tell me where the truth is hidden...!"`
`{a:c:`
`".........Very well.`
` I can tell you."}`
`As that voice rang out, the world bent and swirled.`
`{n}After blinking several times, ......I realized that the world had become a sea of stars.`
`No, that's not quite right.`
` There are stars up there in the sky, but those lights below me aren't stars.`
`They're lights from building windows, street lights, car lights.`
`......I was floating in the dark sky............over a city lined with skyscrapers.`
`".........I can't tell you what the truth is.`
` ......However, if it's a question of how the truth can be reached,`
` ......I can show you the way."`
`"You.................."`
`Various bad memories are jumping out at me from the back of my mind.`
`......That's right.`
` I was chained in place in that strange theater thing......and forced to watch a repulsive fragment where Mom and Dad committed murder......`
`"......I never said that what you saw was the truth."`
`"B‐but you used the red to......"`
`"You yelled out and interrupted, and stopped me from saying any more.`
` ......This is all truth "of a sort, but not necessarily true". That's what I was about to say."`
`".........Just how far are you willing to go to mock me......?"`
`"......I apologize.`
` But I did want to test you."`
`"Test me how?"`
`"I wanted to see if you were ready to accept the truth, no matter what it may be."`
`".............................."`
`"......The truth can betray you sometimes.`
` In fact, there are times when it shows itself as the thing you desire least."`
`"......That fragment I showed you...`
`was probably the worst one imaginable for you.`
` ......However, you aren't fit to reach the truth unless you have the strength and the courage to withstand it, even if it's something like that."`
`".................."`
`I have no comeback.`
`Finding the truth is my goal.`
` I just want to know what happened on that island on that day.`
`......I don't think of myself as wanting to hear only the facts that are pleasing to me.`
`......Have I really been prepared.........to face the bloody, unbearable truth that's probably waiting there for me...?`
`.........If I find the truth, ......it'll mean having to confront my family's tragic end directly......and accept it as it is.`
`And accepting that...`
`.........means abandoning any faint hope for that convenient miracle,`
` ......the idea that one of them might have survived somehow......and might return even though twelve years have passed.`
`Even though I know a miracle like that would be completely ridiculous,`
` ......if I'm honest with myself, I have to admit that the faint hope it brought me has given me comfort these past twelve years.`
`......I want to know the truth.`
` But I want one of them to come back.`
`Those two wishes contradict each other.`
`By learning the truth, ......I'll be forced to accept that no one's coming home......`
`"............The truth is always cruel.`
` At times, it can even cut down your hopes.`
` .........Most of the time, {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s don't realize the costs of learning the truth.`
` ......I simply wanted to see if you had the necessary resolve."`
`I must choose between my two contradicting wishes.`
`Will I find the truth...`
`...and abandon my optimistic hopes for my family's return?`
`Or will I give up on the truth...`
`...and keep waiting for the family that's never actually going to come back,`
` .........deceiving my numb self forever with the childish illusion my brother provided for me?`
`"...............Tell me, Ange.`
` ......Are you truly determined to learn the truth......?"`
`"..............................`
` .........I am."`
`"And your resolve will not falter?"`
`"It won't."`
`After hearing my immediate reply, {f:5:Bernkastel} stared at me.`
`Are those expressionless eyes of hers......measuring my resolve?`
`Now that my brother has even gone to the lengths of becoming a Game Master to cover up the truth...`
`...the only thing I can rely on in my search for the truth is the path that {f:5:Bernkastel} can show me...`
`".........Deep in your eyes...`
`...I see the glint of one who seeks the truth."`
`"Will you tell me?!`
` Will you show me the way that leads to the truth...?!"`
`"Yes.`
` .........I'll guide you.`
` Did you forget, Ange?`
` ..........I am your guardian, am I not...?"`
`When did I last hear {f:5:Bernkastel} use that word?`
`......That's right.`
` At the very beginning, I met her in this future world and became a witch, with her as my guardian.`
`............That's when I become the {f:5:Beatrice} of 1998, the one who could defeat the {f:5:Beatrice} of 1986...`
`"You are the {f:5:Beatrice} of 1998.`
` ......{f:5:Ange Beatrice}.`
` ......I became your guardian and recognized you as a witch.`
` However, you aren't an Endless Witch like Beato."`
`".........A Witch of Truth."`
`"That's right.`
` .........You're like Erika.`
` A Witch of Truth, who will seek the Single Truth, undeceived by any illusions."`
`"As a Witch of Truth, ......{f:5:Ange Beatrice}.........has the power to reach the Single Truth, right...?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......However, up until now, you have been unable to use this power.`
` Do you know why?"`
`"......I do now.`
` .........Even as I sought the truth, ......I unconsciously resisted finding it out."`
`"Exactly.`
` ......Finding the truth was your goal,`
` ......but at the same time, you were unconsciously afraid that learning the truth would mean losing that miracle of your family coming back.`
` ......So, you didn't have what it took to stretch your hand out to the Single Truth."`
`".................................`
` ......You're completely right......`
` I have to admit......that I was naive..."`
`I must admit it.`
`......My entire family is dead.`
`And with recognition of that fact,`
` ......I must expose why they died, and who was behind it.`
`"......Thanks.`
` .........The fragment you showed me in that dark theater......was there to open my eyes."`
`"Many, many games have gone by, waiting for you to become a true Witch of Truth.`
` ......But I think there was a purpose for all of it.`
` ......After all, now, in this final game, you have become a Witch of Truth."`
`".........Tell me.`
` ......What happened on that island that day?`
` ......I won't ask you to tell me that directly.`
` So guide me.`
` What can I do to reach the truth...?!"`
`"It's a bit too chilly here.`
` .........Let's move."`
`"To where?"`
`"To a place better for drinking tea."`
`Massive applause filled the hall.`
`It was applause in honor of a good fight.`
` Applause in honor of {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`"Yes, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}'s game was another splendid one!"`
`"We're going to reveal her game board to all of you, so have a go at it.`
` It's pretty awesome!"`
`"......But you solved it in the end all the same."`
`"A game that no one can solve isn't a game.`
` The main point is whether it was fun or not."`
`"It was fun!`
` I guarantee it."`
`"Same here.`
` At first, I thought there was no way anyone could solve it, but the way you can use one confirmed purple statement after another to narrow down the suspects made for a nice puzzle."`
`"Come, everyone! Gather around, gather around!"`
`"Just what sort of game is Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}'s mystery?!"`
`""That's for you to find out for yourselves!!""`
`Objects resembling chessboards were set out on several tables.`
`Crowds gathered around each, looking down with interest.`
`"Hohoh, it's like a logic puzzle."`
`"Quite an orthodox one, don't you think?"`
`"So this is what a witch's game is like."`
`"Hmm.`
` Looking at it like this, it's just a game.`
` ......But for the pieces, it's a massive series of crimes."`
`"Pu ku ku.`
` Indeed it is."`
`"It would not do to waste such a rare gift from Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` Let us take this opportunity to enjoy {f:5:ourselves}."`
`"Still, this is a tough one......`
` It almost makes you wonder if it was even made to be solvable, doesn't it...?"`
`"You can't get anywhere unless you start by believing it was made to be solvable.`
` ......A battle of wits can't begin until you trust the questioner that the problem can be solved."`
`"And we'll guarantee that it can.`
` Come on, have a go at it...!"`
`With Battler's encouragement, discussions over {f:5:Bernkastel}'s mystery game began at each table.`
`The mix of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s and fantasy creatures in heated discussion was truly a sight to behold.`
`Beato and {f:5:Bernkastel} sat in a chair far off from the discussions.`
`"Would you like some tea?"`
`"Any kind of calming black tea for me.`
` With milk, if you don't mind."`
`"As you wish.`
` ......Is there anything you need, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}?"`
`"......Please add some dried plums to some black tea.`
` ......That's the trick to making terrible tea drinkable."`
`"*cackle*!`
` Come now, don't sulk.`
` We're honestly complimenting your game for being such a fun one."`
`Since she had emerged victorious in the game {f:5:Bernkastel} had put all her heart into, the look on Beato's face was positively gleeful.`
`"......I'm not sulking.`
` My face just looks this way."`
`"When I manage to spot Bern's own kind of warmth in that expression of hers,`
` I feel like I've climbed to the pitch‐black top of a snowy mountain and found the most beautiful star."`
`"......Well, sorry for having an eternally frosty face."`
`"How difficult it is to compliment Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` No matter what you say, she always takes it in a bad way."`
`"That's okay.`
` She's the kind who'll think about it for hours later on."`
`"Hohoh, the type who lies in bed thinking about it and hugging her pillow."`
`"Yep, that's Bern, that's totally Bern."`
`Beato and {f:5:Lambdadelta} giggled together.`
`{n}{f:5:Bernkastel} shrugged and looked away...`
`"Seriously though,`
` this really was a fun, puzzling game."`
`"Was it?`
` .........Thanks."`
`"Even though you could've made it unsolvable,`
` you really did make it to be solved.`
` ......That's not something you can do unless you plan on enjoying a fair game."`
`"......I like games where I win no matter what.`
` Games that I might lose are just a pain."`
`"Later, I'd like to switch sides and try another one.`
` I'll make a puzzle, and we'll see if you can solve it.`
` A game for you to win against me."`
`".............................."`
`"Of course, I'll use all the know‐how I've picked up in my fights with Beato to make it super‐hard.`
` I'm gonna be aiming to win two in a row...!"`
`"............Both you and Beato.`
` ......You have such an interesting way of thinking."`
`"How's that?"`
`"......A game is just a means to decide who wins and who loses, right?`
` When you create one, your own victory should be your highest priority.`
` ......So, why would you go to all the trouble of making a game you might lose...?"`
`"What fun is there in a game that you always win?`
` That's not even a game."`
`".............................."`
`"Victory and defeat.`
` It's fun because you're taking part in a fair competition, balanced between those two outcomes.`
` A game isn't a fight.`
` It's communication.`
` You enjoy the process.`
` And if you manage to win, well, that's just an added bonus."`
`".........Finally.`
` ......Finally, I clearly understand the difference between how all of you think and how I think."`
`"What difference?"`
`"For you, this is communication.`
` ......It isn't for me."`
`"The world you live in must be pretty savage."`
`"...............And what about you?`
` ......Wasn't it the same for you, until you understood Beato's game?`
` ......An eternal game is eternal torture.`
` ......Have you already completely forgotten about that pain you suffered...?"`
`".....................`
` ......There were days I did think that.`
` ......But the game is over now.`
` At the end of a game, I don't complain about stuff that's in the past.`
` What happens on the field stays on the field."`
`"That.........is the critical difference between you and me, I think.`
` ......Your eternal torture was something you could laugh off and forget.`
` ......Mine wasn't nearly so trivial.`
` ......That's all there is to it."`
`"......I don't know your history.`
` ......It sounds like you had it rough."`
`"Hmph.`
` ......To think I'm getting sympathy from a {i:promoted piece}. I must be losing my touch."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel}, sipping the black tea that Genji had brought her, gazed up at the ceiling with a faraway look.`
`Battler may not have known her history,`
` ......but even he was able to understand a bit of how she felt.`
`".........Are you...`
`being tortured by someone right now?"`
`"Are you kidding?`
` .........I'm as free as can be.`
` I'm not bound by anyone's shackles."`
`"Then that's a good thing, isn't it?`
` At least things are better for you now."`
`"............True.`
` It's much better now than it once was.`
` ......Though I am on this long, endless journey to escape from boredom."`
`"Then, at the very least, your encounters here should have been a good thing for you."`
`"Indeed.`
` ......Even the taste of defeat has driven boredom away from me for a time."`
`No, no.`
` Battler was shaking his head and laughing.`
`"......We're friends who've enjoyed fighting in a fair game."`
`"So.........?"`
`"If your days are filled with nothing except running away from boredom,`
` ......feel free to drop by our place every now and then.`
` We'd love to welcome a friend.`
` And we'll spare no effort in setting up all the entertainment needed to help a friend escape from boredom."`
`"You think you can prepare entertainment interesting enough to help {i:me}, the great {f:5:Bernkastel}, escape boredom for even a night...?"`
`"I do.`
` That's what it means to be a friend."`
`".............................."`
`"We won tonight's game.`
` So, the next time you come, we'll switch sides.`
` This time, we'll entertain you with one of our games."`
`"......Of course, we don't intend to let you win easily.`
` We'll challenge you to a devilishly twisted logic game!`
` It won't be something you can solve in a night.`
` It'll be good enough to make you stay for months, wracking your brains over it."`
`".........You would entertain the great {f:5:Bernkastel} as a friend......?"`
`"Yeah, we would."`
`"......Hmph......`
` .........After talking with you,`
` even this dried plum tea is starting to taste sickly sweet.`
` What a pain."`
`"I heard from Beato.`
` Sounds like this dried plum tea stuff is one of your favorites.`
` Next time, we'll toss some high‐class dried plums covered in gold leaf into your tea, so make sure you come again."`
`".........If you really plan to do that, I suggest you find some better tea to start with.`
` ......Tea like this doesn't inspire me to pay you a second visit."`
`"Ah, come on.`
` Guess you drink high‐grade black tea all the time.`
` Alright, then next time, why don't you invite us to somewhere we can drink some of this high‐quality tea?"`
`"..................Me......invite you?`
` ............*giggle*, ............aha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha."`
`"It's only fair, right?`
` We've treated you.`
` Now it's your turn."`
`"Yes, it would be only fair."`
`"So, let's have the game be fair too.`
` Let's switch sides and start a new game.`
` I'm looking forward to it.`
` We won this time, but who knows about the next...?!"`
`".........That's some confidence you have there.`
` And yet, I'm afraid you're mistaken on one point."`
`"What's that?"`
`"My game isn't over yet.`
` ......I wonder who will win in the end."`
`After taking one more sip of her black tea, {f:5:Bernkastel} set her cup on the table, wearing a thin smile.`
`"......The tea here's far too sweet to drink.`
` ......Thank you, Genji.`
` Take this away, please."`
`"As you wish......"`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} asked for her tea to be taken away after taking only two sips.`
`Battler smiled, realizing that this was just {f:5:Bernkastel}'s way of being shy.`
`....................................`
`Battler.`
` ......Why are you smiling with such a foolish, carefree face...?`
`If you really think this final game will be nothing but a happy epilogue...`
`...then I'll have to invite you all to a proper game for bringing this tale to a close.`
`Battler.`
` You forget things too easily.`
`Don't you remember in whose hands lie the key to this final game......?`
`The inside of my nose itched.`
`I'd never regained consciousness to a smell before.`
`Slowly, I opened my eyes.`
`......Wait, when did I lose consciousness in the first place?`
`I don't remember going to sleep or falling unconscious.`
`That's right.`
` ......{f:5:Bernkastel} invited me to come to a place better for drinking tea......`
`......That's when my memory gets hazy.`
` And, since the smell of black tea is what woke me up...`
`"...............Where am I......?"`
`"Auaurora's study.`
` ......I hate to admit it, but her taste in tea really is excellent."`
`I was sitting on what appeared to be a sofa in a dimly lit study.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} sat across from me.`
` ......And right before my eyes was a beautiful cup filled with steaming hot tea.`
`".........Isn't............this place............"`
`I remembered.`
`{n}I've been here before.`
` ......Wasn't it.........`
`{a:c:`
`"How pleasant it is to see you again, child of man."}`
`......Yes, that voice.`
` Just hearing it brings back memories.`
`"Long time no see,`
` .........my master."`
`"I didn't think I would get the chance to welcome you into my study again.`
` ......To think that that game of yours is still continuing."`
`"......It won't be continuing much longer.`
` This is the end, the true final game."`
`This was the study of {f:5:Featherine Augustus Aurora}.`
`The majestic Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating.`
`......Once in the past, I was summoned by her and ordered to be her Reader, or miko.`
`"Don't tell me you want me to Read again..."`
`"I wasn't the one who called you here.`
` ......My miko brought the two of us together."`
`"For what reason...?"`
`"Isn't it obvious?`
` ......To show you the path that leads to the truth."`
`"You'll show me the way, {f:5:Featherine}?"`
`".........I am the Witch of Theatergoing.`
` ......Though I dislike interfering with the actors on the stage."`
`"So, between Battler's boring play...`
`and my exciting one that manipulates the branches of fate, which would you rather watch?`
` ......I know you can't stand even a minute of boredom."`
`"Pft, ......heheheheheheheh."`
`As {f:5:Featherine} rocked her rocking chair, she looked up at the ceiling and chuckled.`
`She clearly holds some key to the truth I seek.`
`".........And yet, you are literally the one holding the key.`
` ......I can do nothing but tell you where to find the keyhole. Child of man."`
`I don't remember saying anything out loud, but {f:5:Featherine} answered my question as though I had.`
`......Come to think of it, that's right.`
`{f:5:Featherine} can read the thoughts of a mere child of man like me as easily as she can hear me speak.`
`Well, I guess that'll help us get to the point quicker...`
`"Onii‐chan gave me this key.`
` But he just said something about how I'd know how to use it when the time was right—he didn't tell me what it's actually for.`
` ......Do you two know?`
` What is this key for?`
` Onii‐chan said it was something very precious."`
`"Explain, my miko."`
`"No way.`
` You explain."`
`"......You demand that your master explain?"`
`"You've got to participate on the stage every now and then.`
` Otherwise you'll just go senile all the faster."`
`"My, my......`
` And yet, the memory of my long‐overdue appearance on the stage when Ange was Reader should have been enough to last me a few more centuries."`
`"Tell me.`
` ......What is this key?"`
`"A physical manifestation of the decision you are to make.`
` ......This tale, this game...`
`...will end by asking you to make a certain decision.`
` What you hold there is the act of your decision embodied in the form of a key."`
`"The physical manifestation......of my decision......"`
`"Exactly.`
` Ultimately, Battler is probably planning to put you in front of two doors, both of which can be opened by the key.`
` Then, he'll ask you to choose which door to open.`
` He must have told you that much, right?"`
`"..................He didn't tell me anything at all.`
` ......He just kept saying things like "you'll know when the time comes".`
` ......No one will tell me anything. ......Not Onii‐chan, not anyone..."`
`"Battler probably wants to respect a decision that you make by your own free will."`
`"But Ange.`
` ......You should've at least started to figure it out by now, right?"`
`"......Figure what out?"`
`"There's an answer Battler wants you to choose, isn't there......?"`
`Those words......made my heart jump in my chest.`
`......I've been thinking that.`
`Onii‐chan is clearly trying......to distance me from the truth,`
` to gloss over it with a vague tale that's almost like a daydream.`
`At the 1986 family conference...`
`...everyone had a wonderful time as they faded away.`
`Everyone is smiling down on you from heaven,`
` so you don't need to feel alone, even in 1998.`
` So give it your all and live on by yourself.`
`......I get the very strong sense that Onii‐chan is intending to end it just like that.`
`And every time I ask him about it,`
` he dodges the issue and says something about how the decision will be mine in the end.`
`"That's right.`
` It may appear that Battler is giving you a fair choice,`
` ......but he's actually scheming to get you to choose one of the two answers.`
` .........You've already seen the farce of a tale that he's using to do that, right?"`
`......That unbelievably bizarre Halloween party.`
`Everyone so strangely friendly that it was almost sickening.`
`I've already seen more than enough of that tale, so sickly sweet it makes me want to vomit,`
` where Ushiromiya Kinzo showered me with affection, where his children swore to support each other, ......where everyone was filled with happiness and hope.`
`"......He's trying to trick me with those chummy scenes......so he can keep me away from the truth.`
` .........He's such a...coward..."`
`"Certainly, he might be called a coward from your perspective.`
` But remember.`
` If you are a player in this game and Battler is the Game Master, ......what does that mean?"`
`"In the past, Battler was a player and Beato was the Game Master.`
` And they each fought for their own respective truths.`
` .........So, what is it this time?"`
`"......I'm a player......and Onii‐chan's the Game Master."`
`Could it be......that I've misunderstood everything from the very beginning?`
`Onii‐chan said he'd tell me what happened that day,`
` ......so I was under the impression that I'd learn everything if I followed him.`
`.........How would that be any different than, say,`
` Onii‐chan accepting everything Beato said about the crimes being the work of a witch?`
`What a......stupid mistake I've been making......`
`"......This game.........has always been a fight between me and Onii‐chan......?"`
`"I'm surprised you participated in the game without realizing that."`
`"......................................."`
`"Battler really is sly.`
` He just started up the final game without letting you realize that simple fact.`
` ......Well, it was the same back in Beato's games.`
` Battler was drawn into her game before he knew what was happening.`
` Before he even knew how to fight.`
` .........That's why I taught him how."`
`"It's exactly the same now.`
` ......You were forced to start this game before you understood anything about it, and I've come to tell you the truth.`
` To tell you who you're fighting against, and for what."`
`"......................................."`
`I was......too shocked to speak.`
`And finally, ......I realized what I needed to accomplish in this game.`
`I've always been passive.`
`I was sure that Onii‐chan would tell me everything,`
` ......so I naively thought I just had to believe whatever he said...`
`"No.`
` ......That was wrong."`
`This game is a battle...`
`......between me, the one who wants to reach the truth, ......and Onii‐chan, who wants to trick me and chase me out into a 1998 where I'm all alone...`
`All this time, ......I've kept on saying that Onii‐chan was foolish and naive,`
` .........and now I see that I was more naive than anyone else...`
`Despite this, {f:5:Bernkastel} didn't sneer at me.`
`On the contrary, ......she looked at me with that cold gaze, as if to say "so you've finally taken the first step".`
`".........Now do you understand?`
` Your own purpose......and the purpose of that key."`
`I gripped the key that Onii‐chan had hung around my neck...`
`and for a while, I shook with an emotion that even I couldn't understand.`
`Now that I know Onii‐chan tricked me, it would be easy to hate him.`
`{n}But hating him would be missing the point.`
`After all, ......this is a game between me and him.`
`Onii‐chan has done nothing but make the optimal moves to win against me.`
`......If games aren't just a playful way to communicate,`
` ......if they're the process that decides who wins and who loses...`
`...then there can be no fair games.`
`The best strategy is obviously to hit your opponent with a sneak attack and defeat them before they even know what's going on, never even telling them the rules......`
`......In that sense, .........Onii‐chan hasn't done anything wrong.`
`He's......using that sickly sweet illusion to trick me.........and force me out into a lonely future......`
`They'll be the only ones having a good time in the cat box, and I'll be the only one chased out.`
`"..................Thank you.`
` ......I'm grateful.`
` I think I've finally been able to truly open my eyes."`
`"Please, don't hate Battler.`
` After all, one‐sidedly tricking the opponent is what Game Masters do."`
`"......I know.`
` Onii‐chan took the best option from his position.`
` That's all there is to it.`
` ............So, I need to make the best possible moves from my position."`
`My goal is now clear.`
`October 4th and 5th, 1986.`
`{n}What happened on Rokkenjima that day.`
`I need to tear off the veil covering the truth.`
` Nothing more, nothing less. `
`"............Onii‐chan gave me this key......probably because he wants me to put it into the keyhole of his choosing.`
` ......That's why he keeps showing me this sentimental illusion.`
` But I won't be fooled anymore.`
` ......I'll open the door I want to open."`
`"Certainly, this is more my kind of tale than one with an Ange who does whatever Battler says."`
`"In that case, I really will hand things over to you now.`
` ......Tell Ange.`
` Tell her where the keyhole that leads to the truth is."`
`"Tell me.`
` Where is the keyhole?!"`
`".........Very well.`
` Have a seat first of all.`
` I will bring it over right now."`
`When {f:5:Featherine} rose from her rocking chair, ......my vision seemed to twist and bend.`
`......What? Some kind of interference?`
`Why now, when {f:5:Featherine}'s about to show me something important,`
` .........is my head......getting......suddenly......`
`I dug my fingernails into my knees, clenching my teeth to keep from losing consciousness.`
`However, ......the world just kept twisting more and more......`
`Except for the feel of the sofa beneath me, I couldn't sense anything at all......`
`"Missy?"`
`".........Huh?"`
`"It looks like she's here."`
`The door opened.........and Hachijo Tohya appeared.`
`......What's going on?`
`This isn't the world of witches......but the world of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s...?`
`I was sitting on a sofa...and Amakusa was behind me.`
`..............................`
`......There's no need to feel confused.`
`{f:5:Featherine} and Hachijo Tohya are the same being.`
`To her, the difference between the two worlds is a trivial thing.`
`To put it in the words of that lover of theatergoing, ......it's like having a slightly different background behind the stage.`
`So, there was no reason for me to feel hesitant.`
`"......Should I call you Hachijo this time?"`
`"How complicated names are.`
` ......Even though both of us are still here, just like before,`
` you have to wonder what to call me."`
`"......True.`
` Calling you {f:5:Featherine} would be a bit rude to you now.`
` ......To an actor, the names of the parts they play are only temporary."`
`"Precisely, child of man."`
`"{f:5:Featherine}??"`
`Amakusa's eyes went wide as he wondered what I was suddenly talking about.`
`{n}I ignored him and continued.`
`"......So, what are you going to show me?"`
`As I spoke, my eyes were caught by that heavy‐looking object she held under her arm.`
`At a glance, it looked like an encyclopedia with a fancy binding...`
`"Do you know what this is?"`
`As {f:5:Featherine} spoke, she set the heavy object on the table.`
`My first thought......was of a grimoire.`
`The heavy book had a mysterious, mystical feel to it, like something Maria onee‐chan might carry around.`
`And the most remarkable feature of it......was the large, sturdy lock that held it shut.`
`Why would someone go so far to keep people from reading a book......?`
`"Why don't you take it and observe the back?"`
`".........The back...?"`
`I flipped the heavy book over on my lap.`
`And, as soon as I saw it, I gave a small gasp.`
`"............EVA...`
`......USHIROM...... Ushiromiya...`
` ......Ushiromiya Eva!"`
`Without a doubt, those words were written there in English letters.`
`"What is this...?`
` Aunt Eva's......diary...?"`
`"Could this be......that rumored..."`
`"Do you know something about this...?!"`
`"Just a rumor.`
` ......They say that President Eva had a secret diary, and that she always kept it locked up.`
` ......They say she took it with her everywhere she went... At least, that's what I heard from some of the other bodyguards."`
`"......A secret......diary...`
` And why is that here......?"`
`"It was in the hospital room where Ushiromiya Eva passed away."`
`This diary was hidden behind her bed.`
`So, it remained in that room for some time after her death before it was found.`
`It was probably someone who worked for the hospital, or else a patient or their family, who happened to find it.`
`......Of course, by that time, there was a huge movement dedicated to the Rokkenjima mystery.`
`A locked diary found in the hospital room where Ushiromiya Eva spent her last moments...`
`...would be absolutely priceless.`
`The discoverer probably handed it over in secret to one of the "Witch Hunters", who would be able to accurately determine its worth.`
`Luckily, the Witch Hunters who got their hands on this book were all noble and upright people.`
`Not content to boorishly destroy the lock and reveal the truth,`
` ......they simply satisfied themselves with the fact that the truth of that day slumbered just on the other side of this mysterious lock.`
`Thanks to that, ......Eva's diary has remained undamaged to this very day...`
`"It is already known that Natsuhi, wife of Krauss, the eldest son of Kinzo,`
` sealed all of her complaints and repressed feelings by writing them down in a diary, which she treated like a sort of charm."`
`"......So, Aunt Eva did the same thing?"`
`"It's possible, at least.`
` ......Unlocking the hinges of this diary would be a pain even if you did have a key.`
` It's sealed up tight like a corset."`
`Amakusa was right.`
`This wasn't a diary made to be casually opened and reminisced over.`
`......It's probably safe to assume that this diary was used to forget things by writing them down and sealing them away, just like Ushiromiya Natsuhi's.`
`And on top of that, Eva brought it with her into her hospital room, then hid it behind the bed without telling anyone about it...`
`".........Don't tell me that diary contains...`
` ......Are you saying Aunt Eva wrote down what happened that day...?"`
`"By reading its contents, you will probably learn everything.`
` ......However, we don't know where the key that unlocks it is."`
`I jumped.`
`Then, I looked down at my chest.`
`{n}That's where my brother hung that key......`
`"Huh?`
` I‐......it's gone!`
` Th‐......the key's gone...!"`
`"......What's wrong, missy?`
` What key?"`
`"It's been hanging from my neck the whole time, hasn't it?!"`
`"......I never noticed it.`
` You had a key hanging from your neck...?"`
`I understood almost immediately.`
`In the world of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, I haven't found the key.`
`The "me" with the key......is on the game board in the world of witches.`
`"Make me the "me" with the key!`
` I'm going to unlock this diary."`
`{f:5:Featherine} lifted a finger, spun it around, and the world twisted again.`
`When I returned to {f:5:Featherine}'s study, the key faded back into existence, hanging from my neck.`
`But at the same time, ......the diary on my lap faded out of existence.`
`"Where'd the diary go?!"`
`"It should exist somewhere on the game board.`
` Since it is one of the keyholes you are to be given, it must exist somewhere."`
`"Did Onii‐chan hide it somewhere...?"`
`"......Since Battler is trying to make this a game between you and him,`
` it probably isn't completely hidden."`
`"What do you mean...?"`
`"Even if Battler thinks of it as a king that mustn't be taken,`
` there would be no game unless it existed somewhere on this board."`
`"In other words, .........it's somewhere in the Ushiromiya mansion...?"`
`"Or, you may already have been given an opportunity to witness it.`
` ......Like how a swindler has already hidden a trap in microscopic letters on the first page of a contract you sign."`
`"......If Battler follows the rules of mystery as the Game Master,`
` .........‘clues must be shown’,`
` so the choice that leads to Battler's defeat must also have been shown."`
`".........Ange.`
` Try and remember.`
` ......You should have seen Eva's diary already in Battler's world."`
`In that instant, .........from the back of my mind...`
`......drifted the very first scene of this final game.`
`In the chapel...`
`......A book lying on the altar, a book with a lock on it......`
`As soon as I showed interest in that book, ......my brother suddenly got serious and told me not to touch it......`
`"That.........was Aunt Eva's diary........."`
`"That's right.`
` Ushiromiya Eva's diary.`
` The Book of the Single Truth, with the truth of that day written inside it."`
`"......The Book...of the Single Truth......`
` And is the truth really written inside it?`
` After all, there's a chance that it's just something Aunt Eva—"`
`"I'll give it to you in red truth.`
` ......{p:1:Ushiromiya Eva's diary, the Book of the Single Truth,`
` has written within it the truth of Rokkenjima during October 4th and 5th, 1986}."`
