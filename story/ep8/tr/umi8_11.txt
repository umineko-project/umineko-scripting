`The discussions over {f:5:Bernkastel}'s reasoning game were getting heated at each of the tables.`
`At some point, each table had started competing to see which could solve it first.`
`"{f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` Haven't Ange and Erika arrived yet?"`
`"......They should be here any moment.`
` Wanna make a bet on who arrives first?"`
`"I can understand Erika being late, but what about Ange?`
` ......Just what kind of pit did you toss her into this time?"`
`"How rude.`
` She was sitting on a sofa sipping tea."`
`"Hopefully the sort of tea you drink suits Ange's tastes."`
`"Hahaha, good point."`
`"How rude.`
` That tea would suit anyone's tastes.`
` ......Erika would even lick the last drop of my tea from the bottom of a miso soup pot."`
`"......How does miso soup come into this picture...?"`
`"Now that you mention her, ......Erika...!`
` This will be a long awaited reunion."`
`"Yeah, come to think of it.`
` Can't wait to see how long it'll take her to solve {f:5:Bernkastel}'s game."`
`"......This sort of game is what that kid's best at.`
` She'll probably read it from start to finish three times, then just say the answer right away."`
`"Probably.`
` I look forward to seeing her give the correct answer immediately with that smug look on her face."`
`"Come now, this is Erika we're talking about.`
` She'll probably pull out some twisted logic and say that it was possible for someone other than Battler's family."`
`"Good point.`
` In fact, I'd like to hear her proud, twisted logic even more than the right answer."`
`Apparently, Battler and Beato were looking forward to their reunion with Erika.`
`......They had already dueled with Erika in two separate games.`
`But now, there was no distinction between foes and allies.`
`They truly wanted to welcome her to this "after‐show party" as a friend...`
`"Still, it's a bit unexpected."`
`".........What is?"`
`"You know.`
` It's surprising that you'd let Ange go this easily."`
`Making sure that Battler and the others couldn't see her face, {f:5:Lambdadelta} sniggered.`
`"Is it really so surprising...?"`
`"Of course it is.`
` I thought that, being you, you'd torture Battler with one tough puzzle after another before releasing her,`
` .........or that you'd at least try to give Ange some weird ideas and have her turn the game around in the end."`
`"..........................."`
`"And I thought I knew you better than anyone else in the world.`
` So embarrassing that I was wrong."`
`"......I'm sure it is.`
` But don't worry.`
` ......You obviously do know me better than anyone else in the world."`
`"Y‐......yeah, of course!`
` After all, I love, adore, and understand you more than any other person in the universe{p:0:☆}"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} was flustered by {f:5:Bernkastel}'s apparently friendly words, which were very rare, coming from her.`
`"......Battler‐sama.`
` Pardon me for interrupting your conversation.`
` Ange‐sama has returned."`
`"Oh, she's back?!`
` Great.`
` So, is she okay...?"`
`"It seems that she was soaked by the rain, but Kumasawa is bringing her a towel now."`
`When Battler heard this, he breathed a sigh of relief.`
`Then, he turned to face {f:5:Bernkastel}, showing her a forced smile as though apologizing for still suspecting her just a little.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} showed no reaction, and simply continued to wear a blank expression with a slight smile.`
`"Ange‐sama has returned."`
`".........I'm back."`
`"Battler!`
` Ange's back...!"`
`"Ange...!`
` Wonderful. I was worried."`
`"........................"`
`Ange stared at Battler as he dashed towards her with a relieved smile.`
`Her expression seemed somehow indifferent.`
`"......That Battler.`
` Looks like he thought I had you hanging by chains in a cave or something."`
`"N‐no, no.`
` I didn't think you'd go that far."`
`".........I was just having some tea at the house of one of {f:5:Bernkastel}'s friends.`
` It was delicious."`
`"Were there any dried plums or miso soup in it...?!"`
`"..............................`
` ......Why would there be?"`
`As Ange spoke bluntly, she walked right past her brother and exchanged a few whispered words with {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`"What is it, Battler?"`
`"Huh? Oh, nothing......`
` Nothing at all."`
`If he said that his little sister being cold to him had left him feeling forlorn, Beato would either laugh at him or scratch him.`
`After all, Ange was a girl at a tender age.`
`She might be in a bad mood for reasons that a man like him couldn't understand.`
`......Taking note of this, and having satisfied himself that Ange was okay, he made to walk away.`
`"Battler.`
` ......Ange is calling for you."`
`"Huh?`
` Oh, sorry."`
`"I've been trying to get your attention for a while.`
` Don't ignore me."`
`"......I wasn't really ignoring you.`
` ......What's going on with you, anyway?`
` You've looked like you're in a bad mood for a while now."`
`"I imagine {f:5:Bernkastel} gave her something strange to drink and pretended it was just a rare sort of black tea.`
` Hyah{0}hyah{0}hya!"`
`"......I have no business with you.`
` Back off for a bit, would you?`
` I want to talk to Onii‐chan alone."`
`"Come, come, I may not look it, but I am the wife of the territory lord...!`
` When it comes to Battler, I am far more—"`
`"......Sorry, Beato.`
` Would you mind leaving for just a bit?"`
`By now, Battler had realized that Ange's issue was more than just a slight bad mood.`
`Beato puffed out her cheeks as though she wanted to say something back.`
` However, she just let out a sigh and walked away...`
`"................................."`
`"......Is this okay?"`
`"It is.`
` After all, this game is between me and you, right?`
` I'm the player.`
` You're the Game Master.`
` ......No matter how many pieces get between us, in the end, it's still a direct battle between you and me."`
`"......Well, it's true that I'm the Game Master, but it's not like I'm fighting against you or anything.`
` This final game was held so you could be invited to the Rokkenjima of 1986."`
`"Games are played to decide who wins and who loses.`
` It's not called a game unless you have foes and allies.`
` ......Don't try to trick me."`
`"What......are you talking about, all of a sudden...?"`
`"You had me totally fooled.`
` At first, I actually thought you'd take me to that day in 1986.`
` ......But that wasn't true!"`
`"This has all been a farce you created, hasn't it?!`
` You're using this sentimental tale to dodge the issue and leave me confused!`
` You're trying to chase me out into a lonely future with nothing but this lukewarm happiness as a parting gift!`
` There's just one thing I've been after since the beginning!`
` What happened on Rokkenjima that day?!"`
`"And the only answer you gave me was this game!`
` This sentimental party of illusions!!`
` Your answer to my question is beyond clear at this point!`
` I want the truth!!`
` And you have no intention of telling me!"`
`"Ange, ......listen, you've got it wrong—"`
`"Don't try and trick me!!`
` I know now that this game is the final fight between me and you!`
` Me, searching for the truth of that day!`
` And you, trying to hide that truth behind an illusion!!"`
`"It's exactly the same!`
` The setup is no different than those fights between you and Beato!`
` It wouldn't have been much longer before I was chased out of the gameboard with everything still vague and fuzzy because of you!"`
`"Well, sorry, but I've already figured out that this game is a battle.`
` Don't think you'll trick me so easily anymore!"`
`Ange's shouting tore apart the peaceful atmosphere.`
`The family members and the residents of fantasy gulped and watched the scene, wondering what was going on......`
`Beato tried to run up to Battler, but he motioned for her to stay back.`
`"......What is it you want?"`
`"There's only one thing I've ever wanted!`
` The truth of Rokkenjima in 1986.`
` That's all I'm looking for!!"`
`"The truth is sealed within the cat box.`
` ......It can't be reached by someone outside the cat box like you."`
`"Is that why you're trying to palm me off with this sentimental illusion?!"`
`"Yes, this is an illusion.`
` However, I wanted you to remember this fun atmosphere, ......the harmony within your family.`
` .........It's not about what happened on that island that day.`
` I wanted you to remember the warmth of these family conferences, a warmth you forgot about."`
`"That's just an illusion you're trying to impose on me!`
` I reject that and deny it completely!!"`
`"The truth of 1986 doesn't exist.`
` The cat box is empty inside.`
` ......You're looking for something that isn't there."`
`"......Hmph.`
` I won't be tricked anymore.`
` .........The truth of that day does exist.`
` ......It was written down by the sole survivor and preserved to this very day!"`
`Battler's expression faltered for just an instant, and Ange didn't miss it.`
`So he was hiding it after all.`
`Onii‐chan...has been hiding the Book of the Single Truth from me...!!`
`"Aunt Eva...!`
` For the first time since your death, I'd like to express my gratitude.`
` ......Because you wrote down what happened that day, you gave me one last chance at learning the truth...!"`
`"A‐......Ange‐chan, you have to listen to me...!`
` Everything I wrote in that diary is nonsense, so it doesn't......"`
`"There's no point trying to deceive me.`
` Your diary has the truth of that day written in it!`
` It's already been proven with the red truth!"`
`"......A‐absurd.`
` Who could possibly use the red truth besides Battler, the Game Master...?!"`
`"..............................`
` ......It's Auaurora, isn't it?"`
`"That's right.`
` ......The "Book of the Single Truth" exists in 1998, the world of the future.`
` Who else could perform the crucial role of confirming its contents with the red truth...?"`
`"I heard everything from {f:5:Bernkastel}!!`
` I've been fooled by you long enough!!`
` I don't want some sentimental illusion.`
` I want the real truth!!"`
`"And no matter how hard you try to cover it up in 1986, I can expose it in 1998!!`
` After all,`
` you are the {f:5:Beatrice} of 1986, Onii‐chan, ......and I am the {f:5:Beatrice} of 1998!!"`
`A cyclone rose up around Ange.`
`It was a golden swirl of gold butterflies.`
`{n}Just like the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}......`
`"I am {f:5:Ange Beatrice} of 1998, the final Golden Witch!!`
` No witch of the past can defeat a witch of the future!!"`
`The cyclone of gold broke apart, and as gold leaves scattered across the room, .........the final witch, who would inherit {f:5:Beatrice}'s name in the future, appeared.`
`"{f:5:Ange}......{f:5:Beatrice}............"`
`"You are the Golden and Endless Witch.`
` I'm not!`
` I'm the Witch of Gold and Truth!`
` No illusion can stand in my way!!"`
`"Your boring party is over, Onii‐chan!`
` Now it's time for my party to start!!`
` I've even readied a game to liven things up!`
` You're up, Aunt Eva."`
`"Huh...?!"`
`When Ange snapped her fingers, she vanished among a swirl of gold butterflies.`
`In her place in the middle of the cyclone, a girl wearing a dress appeared, bowing modestly......`
`"You......!"`
`"......That's pretty rude, you know?`
` ......Inviting everyone to the party except me."`
`"You're.........{f:5:Eva}.........!!"`
`"The sole survivor of Rokkenjima.`
` And a witch of the future, the Golden and Endless Witch from 1986 to 1998!!"`
`"In the world of the future, Battler‐kun, your sappy illusion is more fragile than a flake of snow on a lake!`
` Okay, let's have some fun!!`
` Come, try to remember, {i:all of you}... Remember your endless theory‐making!!"`
`When {f:5:Eva} held her hand to the heavens, light gathered there and took the form of a bottle.`
`Yes, a bottle.`
` A glass bottle with no label.`
`There was no alcohol inside.`
` ......Sealed within it was a fragment that let off a pale, sinister light.`
`"B‐Battler!! This is bad!!`
` She must not smash that bottle!!"`
`"It's showtime!!!"`
`The bottle was slammed against the floor and smashed to pieces.`
`As soon as the fragment within it touched the outside air, it flashed white and burst.`
`......At first, it seemed that nothing had happened. `
`However, {f:5:Eva} grinned at them before becoming a cloud of butterflies and vanishing.`
`Come to think of it, {f:5:Bernkastel} was gone as well.`
`"What did she do...?!"`
`"......It was probably a fragment she brought back with her from the world of the future.`
` ......Perhaps we could call it the contents of the cat box in the future."`
`"So, what does that mean?!`
` What now?!"`
`At that moment, they heard a tremendous hiss.`
`{n}It was as though large chunks of hail had started falling everywhere.`
`An earthquake accompanied that noise, and the whole mansion groaned.`
` Dust began to fall from the ceiling.`
`At the same time, it seemed as though the curtain‐covered window glowed with a pale light.`
`"Wh‐what on Earth is going on...?"`
`"Kyrie, look outside!`
` What the hell is that?!"`
`Everyone rushed to a window in response to her voice.`
` Of course, Battler and Beato went too.`
`Then, they drew the curtains, looked at the scene outside, ......and were stunned into silence.`
`".........How......beautiful......"`
`Kinzo's words spoke for the first impression felt by all who looked out the windows.`
`"......Not all beauty is benign."`
`"They always say that beauty has thorns nyeh."`
`Though everyone found the scene beautiful, ......it gave them all an ominous feeling.`
`Outside the window, ......countless small objects, crystal fragments glowing pale blue, lay strewn about everywhere like fallen hail.`
`The word "fantastical" perfectly summed up the scene that lay before them in the glowing rose garden......`
`"......Just now, I saw something move over there...!"`
`"H‐hey, is there someone over there?!`
` Wait, huh...?!"`
`"......A, a person...just grew out of that glowing fragment...!"`
`"Seven Sisters of Purgatory, battle formation!!"`
`With those words of Lucifer's, everyone finally realized that they were surrounded by "danger"...`
`One by one, the countless fragments shook and burst, ......and large, dark bodies rose up from inside each.`
`They were...giants with goat heads.`
`One after another, they appeared from the insides of broken fragments.`
`The realization that the countless fragments lying all over the rose garden were responsible for the blue glow covering the entire area......sent a wave of cold terror rushing over all present.`
`"45! Wide‐area surveillance!"`
`"......M‐my radar's filled with white!`
` We're either being jammed, or......or the vast number of readings is making a count of enemy numbers impossible!!"`
`Even as she said this, the glowing rose garden outside the window was filling with giant goats.`
`The fragments carrying the goats weren't just in the rose garden...... They were spread evenly across the entire island.`
`......Not just the rose garden, ......but the entire area around the mansion had to be half‐covered with goats by now...`
`".........For your attention."`
`"Know that we are completely surrounded."`
`"Yeah, we noticed......"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihi.`
` What'll you do now, Battler...?"`
`"Only one thing to do with uninvited guests, and that's show them the door.`
` ......Who are these people?`
` I'm guessing these aren't your minions, right, Beato?"`
`"......The goat forms they hold are probably just imitations of the pieces on this game board."`
`"They aren't Riiche's or Lia's minions.`
` ......This is something worse."`
`"......I {f:5:see}.`
` ......A manifestation of the messages within the {f:5:bottles}."`
`"Messages within the bottles?`
` Beato's message bottles?"`
`"No.`
` ......These fragments are delusions from the people of the future."`
`"......Endless possibilities are hidden within the cat box.`
` ......Because of that, those outside the box can imagine the insides to be any one of an infinite number of things.`
` ......It would seem those endless delusions are the true nature of these creatures."`
`"Wh‐what will those goats do to us, I wonder..."`
`"It doesn't look like they're coming to give us a handshake and a pat on the back."`
`"......Those people......`
` .........They're lowlifes, making up and passing around stories, imagining the tragedies that might have unfolded for us on this island...`
` ......They found it so interesting that I never talked about the truth......that they kept on creating tragedies one after another for their own enjoyment......"`
`"I see.`
` .........So, they're fragments of the future, containing delusions about the 1986 cat box......"`
`"In the future world, any and all interpretations can and do {f:5:exist}.`
` Unless we deny them, each will be able to call their own views the truth, and they will remain on this {f:5:island}."`
`"Ahhahahahahahaha!`
` What a fix we're in!"`
`"Looks like we're surrounded and fighting for our lives!"`
`"Hmm, what are they doing...?"`
`"Th‐they're eating... They're eating something...!"`
`"......They're eating......the roses...?!"`
`The squirming crowd of goats was busily doing something.`
`If you looked closely, you could see them sticking their heads into the rose bushes and munching away.`
`And it wasn't just the rose bushes.`
`Light poles, the bricks of the flower beds, ......and even the stone paving itself—they were biting all of it.`
` Almost as if they were trying to eat up the whole island.`
`"No.`
` ......They aren't just eating..."`
`"If they aren't eating, then what are they doing...?!"`
`".........What they are doing is not eating.`
` They are eroding, shaving away.`
` ......Shaving away the game board itself."`
`"They're......eating the game board...?!"`
`"In the future world, everyone believes that we were swallowed up by tragedy today!`
` ......That's why "they" won't accept a truth where we enjoy ourselves in peace...!"`
`"......Truths of the past are inferior to truths of the future.`
` ......The merciless future fangs and jaws of those goats......refuse to accept our truth and are eroding it, replacing it with "the truth they wish to see"."`
`"D‐......dammit...`
` ......This is our truth...!`
` It's not for those people in the future, who have nothing to do with us anyway, to rewrite as they please...!"`
`The garden outside the window was now filled with too many goats to count, all chewing away.`
`This repulsive scene stole the words from everyone's lips......`
`......They weren't just stunned into silence.`
`There was just no point in making a fuss and letting the goats know for no reason.`
`No point in letting them know......that there was plenty of prey waiting in this bright, warm room, ......prey that was softer and more satisfying to chew than roses or bricks......`
`"Th‐that goat there, he's looking at us...!"`
`"......Silence. Don't make a fuss."`
`"......I‐it's coming this way...`
` ......Isn't this bad......?"`
`They saw one of the newly born goats head slowly towards their window.`
`There was already a huge swarm of them in the garden, so it was no surprise that, when one of them looked around for new prey, it would see the light from this window.`
`Its immense, eerie body slowly approached.`
`As it grew closer, they could finally see its disturbing form clearly.`
`The eyes blazed, and yet were still cold, ruthless, and reptilian.`
`The cruel fangs and jaw could tear apart and crush anything.`
`Any fangs that could chew through brick would hardly have a problem chewing through {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s...`
`Its massive body had to be taller than the windows themselves......`
`And......it was lumbering towards this window......`
`"This window...isn't made out of special Ushiromiya bulletproof glass, by any chance, is it?"`
`"......I doubt even bulletproof glass would stop that thing."`
`"W‐waah...!!`
` It's coming, it's coming! It's running towards us!!!"`
`"......For your attention:`
` know that this window shall not be breached."`
`The power of Cornelia's seal formed a shield around the glass.`
`The goat was blown back, unable even to touch the glass because of this power.`
`Its weight made the earth tremble.`
` They could feel that clearly, even inside.`
`......But that tremor had also drawn the attention of the nearby goats.`
`A pack of goats started shuffling closer, ......and then, realizing that they were in competition for this new prey, the pack quickly broke into a thundering charge.`
`The window protected by Cornelia's seal would probably be safe.`
` However, there were many windows in the great hall.`
`For the first time, those windows became a source of terror instead of sunlight and a lovely view.`
`"Gertrude!"`
`"......For your attention: know that this window shall not be breached."`
`Getrude sealed another window.`
`{n}The goats trying to break in through that one were thrown back.`
`But at the same time, those inside the building heard the terrible crash of a third window being shattered.`
`Scattering fragments of glass everywhere, the massive goats broke through the window frame and entered the building.`
`"W‐waaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"G‐get back! Everyone get back!"`
`‘......On the first twilight......sacrifice the six...............’`
`Those words really were coming from the goat's mouth.`
`{n}Along with steaming, foul breath.`
`However, it didn't get a chance to say any more.`
`Forehead, neck, shoulder,`
` chest, side, gut, knee—the stakes of the Seven Sisters buried themselves in deep one after another.`
`"What rough, unappetizing flesh for piercing!"`
`"I just couldn't bear to gobble up any more of these...!"`
`Several other windows shattered one after another, and goats squeezed their way in through the window frames.`
`Their mouths were still stuffed with the bricks they had just been snacking on.`
`Each time they chewed, it made a ghastly sound like bones being crushed...`
`"......We will repel {f:5:them}."`
`"Chiester Troops, prepare for close‐range combat!"`
`"Hold up.`
` ......You start firing away and we'll have all the other goats coming to join the party."`
`"......Let's fall back to the second floor.`
` If we can seal the staircase, that'll buy us some time."`
`"Everyone, upstairs.`
` ......Hurry!"`
`After sniffing noisily as though scanning the smells around them,`
` the goats started chewing on whatever chairs, tables, or curtains were close by.`
`The goats would chew anything to bits, as long as it was near them.`
`If the others were careful not to attract the goats' attention, they would be able to escape from this place......`
`The {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s ran on ahead up to the second floor, while the fantasy creatures, who were used to fighting, guarded the rear.`
`The goats were completely absorbed by their all‐consuming feast in the hall.`
`......Even the portrait of {f:5:Beatrice}, which might have been called the symbol of the whole Ushiromiya family, had now been brutally chewed up...`
`"Battler, the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s have all taken refuge on the second floor...!"`
`"Good.`
` Dlanor, seal all the staircases."`
`"Gertrude and Cornelia will handle {f:5:it}.`
` However, they need more {f:5:time}."`
`Loud beating sounds—whether that could be called "knocking" was unclear—and sounds of shattering glass could be heard from all parts of the mansion.`
`"......Well now, ladies and gentlemen.`
` It's time for work."`
`"Seven Sisters of Purgatory, right here!`
` Let's go, you lowlifes!`
` Tonight, it's all‐you‐can‐eat!!"`
`"Chiester Troops, halt all external tasks.`
` Cancel automatic updates, accept no data, take no prisoners!"`
`"Eiserne Jungfrau of the Seventh {f:5:District}.`
` By the territory lord's order, carry out your {f:5:duty}."`
`"......I'll lend a hand.`
` Lion, you're in the way.`
` Go up to the second floor."`
`"But Will...!"`
`"Leave this to us and go.`
` ......You have your own job to do. Protect your family."`
`"I, ......I understand.`
` ......Everyone, stay safe......"`
`The mansion was filled with the sounds of bashing, crushing, smashing, and chewing.`
`The goats and their wave of destruction were drawing steadily closer......`
`"......Lord {f:5:Battler}.`
` Gertrude and Cornelia have finished sealing the other {f:5:staircases}.`
` The large staircase here is the only one that {f:5:remains}."`
`"The other staircases are tiny, so they went fast.`
` On the other hand, this staircase is huuuge.`
` Looks like you'll have your hands full buying time."`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} spoke as though it was someone else's problem.`
`It only took a glance at her face to see that she had no intention of lending a hand.`
`Even so, Beato didn't scold her.`
`......This was a game between Battler and Ange.`
` {f:5:Lambdadelta} was only a theatergoer who had been invited.`
`"......Don't think badly of me.`
` ......Even I'd die if I was torn apart by nothingness.`
` Sorry, but I think I'll stick to being an observer."`
`"That's what you've always been.`
` .........Though it is a shame that we can't ask for your help."`
`"......Nah, she's being nice.`
` Doesn't want to steal our show."`
`"Heheh.`
` Sure, let's say that's the reason."`
`As a Voyager witch, {f:5:Lambdadelta} could retreat from this game board of Battler's if she wanted to.`
`In other words, she was the only one who wasn't in trouble now.`
`"See you later.`
` ......I think I'll watch this game between you and Bern 'til the end.`
` ......I'll be rooting for you."`
`"As you munch on popcorn?"`
`"Of course.`
` I think I'll have some soy‐sauce butter flavor today."`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} vanished with a pop.`
`As soon as she did, a black hole opened up in midair, and Gaap fell out of it.`
`"Battler, Riiche.`
` Could you come here for a second?`
` You should probably see this."`
`"......Right now?"`
`"Yes."`
`"Let's go.`
` ......Everyone, we're counting on you to hold this position...!"`
`When Gaap snapped her fingers, a large hole opened up under Battler and Beato, swallowing them both.`
`When it spat them back out again, .........they were in an inky‐black sky.`
`Both of them were floating in the night sky.`
` They could see Rokkenjima far beneath them.`
`And, as soon as they realized this, ......they shuddered.`
`"......Th‐this is............!!"`
`"It's not a crowd.`
` ......It's a sea."`
`It was no longer a crowd of goats, but an entire sea of them.`
`Just as Rokkenjima poked out from the ocean,`
` the mansion was now poking out from a sea of goats.`
`"......People in the future really are amazing.`
` ......Just how many of them have imagined the tragedy on this island?"`
`"They're nothing more than worthless drivel from outside the cat box...!`
` Let's clean this place up...!!"`
`"Now look over there.`
` ......It's hard to tell, but look at the shoreline."`
`"......The shoreline...?"`
`"It's easiest to see near the harbor.`
` Look closely.`
` .........See it......?"`
`"D‐don't tell me...?!"`
`"......Yeah, ......you're probably right.`
` ......They're......eating it.`
` ......Eating the whole island......"`
`"Come, try to remember, fragments of the future!!`
` Why don't you just chew up all the ostentation, all the illusions, all the fantasy, forever?!"`
`As {f:5:Eva} yelled this to the heavens, hovering above the raging sea, ......hail fell down with a pale glow.`
`Each one was a bottle with no label and a fragment inside.`
`They poured onto the island, smashing into bits and scattering the fragments inside them everywhere.`
`Every now and then, one of those fragments would split in two, then split in two again,`
` and every single one of those fragments burst and gave birth to a massive goat.`
`To say it was like bamboo shoots springing up after the rain would be a vast understatement.`
`The goats writhed about like bubbling, boiling water in a pot.`
`They ate away at everything they saw.`
`They didn't just eat the harbor, but the trees and rocks, the entire coastline itself.`
` Hundreds, thousands, ...no, tens of thousands of goats continued to eat...`
`They were chewing away at every bit of Rokkenjima, ......of this final game that Battler had prepared......`
`"Ahhahahhahahahahaha!!`
` Too bad, Battler‐kun!`
` The future wants a tragedy on this island...!`
` Even Ange wants the truth!`
` We'll just chew up all the ostentation, illusions, and fantasy for them!!"`
`By now, Battler and the others had to admit it.`
`The future wanted a tragedy.`
`{n}Even if the truth of this island had been a gentle, peaceful thing.`
`{n}The future didn't want that.`
`The truth they wanted...was painting over the past.`
`"......The past is such a fragile thing.`
` Even the cat box is being chewed apart."`
`"Just who are these people......?`
` ......Are they really so determined to throw us into a tragedy...?"`
`"That's all I wanted to show you.`
` .........Hopefully, this'll be useful for making a strategic decision."`
`"Yeah, thanks.`
` Thanks to that, I feel just awful now."`
`"Then let's go to the study next, if you don't mind.`
` {f:5:Goldsmith} wants to talk to you."`
`Gaap snapped her fingers, and another black hole swallowed them up and spat them out in the study.`
`"Owowowowow...`
` Gaap, if you're gonna drop me, at least do it on a bed."`
`"......Grandfather, we're in trouble. There's absolutely nowhere left to go...!"`
`"I know.`
` And even waiting out the storm from here is not an option."`
`"Ronove and the others should be able to buy us some time, but that's all."`
`If they just holed up in the mansion and fought from there, it would only be a matter of time before the swarm of goats got them.`
`Trying to repel a few of the goats who barged into the mansion...`
`would be like using a cup to bail water from a boat with a hole in it.`
`"We could fight defensively for a while, but then it would only be a matter of time..."`
`"We need to think of something while we fight.`
` ......Can we escape?!`
` Where to?!`
` Is there any way for us to leave the game board?!"`
`"Outside the game board is outside of our territory.`
` Only a Voyager witch could leave it."`
`Only {f:5:Bernkastel} and {f:5:Lambdadelta} could do it.`
`However, there was no way {f:5:Bernkastel} would help.`
`Even {f:5:Lambdadelta} had already announced that she would be an observer instead of lending a hand.`
`"So, there's nowhere left to run."`
`"No, there is just one place."`
`"Where?!"`
`"The Golden Land."`
`"I see......`
` Is that our only option now...?!"`
`"Indeed.`
` The Golden Land is the most impenetrable place on this game board.`
` If we wish to escape, it's that or nothing."`
`"These things are eating the cat box itself.`
` For all we know, at any moment, they could start chewing away at the Golden Land as well."`
`"............Nn, ...what should we do, Battler...?!"`
`"Not hesitate. We're retreating.`
` ......If we take too long to make a decision, even that road will be closed to us.`
` Let's evacuate everyone.`
` How can we open the door to the Golden Land?!"`
`"I just have to open it.`
` ......However, an immense cloud of the anti‐magic toxin is emanating from that crowd of goats.`
` It will take some time to open the door."`
`"So, we've only got to protect this study with our lives until the door's open.`
` Just have to keep doing what we've been doing."`
`"There's one more problem.`
` ......The door to the Golden Land cannot be shut unless two people close it from the outside."`
`"Two from the outside...?`
` What do you mean...?"`
`As soon as he said this, Battler realized.`
`{n}This must be an agreement made between the three witches who are one...`
`"Normally, there's no need to go to the trouble of shutting the door...`
` We can't do that this time, though."`
`"......Only you and Beato can fulfill the role of shutting the door."`
`"Me, the territory lord, and Beato.`
` It does seem to be the safest choice."`
`"Indeed.`
` If it's just the two of us, we might even be able to protect ourselves."`
`"Okay, open the door...!"`
`Beato waved her pipe, leaving a golden trail behind as she sliced the air vertically.`
`Then, the gap of the door to the Golden Land appeared.`
` It looked like nothing more than a thin golden string hanging from the ceiling.`
`If you looked closely, you could see that the string was getting thicker, very slowly.`
`The door to the Golden Land certainly was opening, but so slowly that you couldn't even tell if you weren't careful.`
`At this rate, it would probably take quite some time before it grew big enough to let a person through......`
`"Grandfather, Gaap, we'll need you to be our inner line of defense!"`
`"Yes, there may be goats climbing up the outer walls...!"`
`"Very well.`
` My rifle is hungry for some prey!"`
`"Understood.`
` It'll be fun dropping those things into the Abyss."`
`A giant was sliced at an angle, split into two parts, ......then fell to the floor, showering it with filthy dark blood and guts.`
`"Splendidly {f:5:done}."`
`"......I'll let you have the next one."`
`Countless massive goats, which had forced their way in from rooms and windows all across the mansion, wandered about in search of something to chew.`
`Several of the goats noticed the group of people huddled around the staircase and lumbered closer, but they were pulverized by merciless attacks.`
`Ronove's shields easily halted the charging of the goats, and {f:5:Virgilia}'s magic spears pinned the giants against the walls.`
`Dlanor's and Will's blades also sliced the goats effortlessly in two.`
`The pinpoint strikes of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory could pierce the vitals of and finish off any opponent, no matter how large.`
`The Chiester Sisters were holding their own too.`
`One shot from their high‐caliber firearms blasted so many goats to bits that you couldn't count the kills with both hands.`
`They would have been more than a match for a limited number of opponents.`
`However, they weren't just up against a crowd, but an entire sea.`
`It was like a pebble trying to face the approaching waves of a stormy sea......`
`"Hurry on that gun barrel replacement! Requesting cover from the Purgatory troops!"`
`"You run out of bullets and you're nothing but rabbits.`
` Laaame!"`
`"I don't wanna hear that from a bunch of seven paperweights that can only kill one person at a time nyeh."`
`"Yeah, keep them coming!!`
` Don't let us get bored!!"`
`The hall was filled with the corpses of massive goats.`
`As if in fear of this sight, the goats that came in one after another formed a wall, keeping their distance.`
`"......Perhaps they think they're no match for us."`
`"I wish that were {f:5:true}.`
` ......But it seems to be little more than wishful {f:5:thinking}."`
`"What're those guys doing...?`
` They're looking at us......and whispering to each other."`
`"Apparently, they have enough intelligence to talk with each other and cooperate."`
`The goats were surrounding them at a distance and whispering to each other.`
`Then, they nodded at each other as though deciding something, and the whole group stirred.`
`......What are they doing?`
` It almost looks like they're lining up in a different order......`
`"The enemy is changing its formation...!`
` It appears that the individuals with greater destructive power are being gathered in the front lines!"`
`"And so what? Let's go!!"`
`""""""Yes, Onee‐sama!!""""""`
`"Wait! Something's wrong...!"`
`Lucifer took aim at one of them, going for its forehead.`
`The other six sisters followed her lead, trying to pierce the vital organs all over the creature's body.`
`However, there was no sound of pierced flesh.`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory were knocked back, unable to cause even the smallest wound.`
`"Wh‐what?!`
` What just happened?!"`
`"......Those guys are talking about something."`
`The goats kept whispering the same thing, over and over, as they slowly approached the Seven Sisters.`
`All of them whispered unanimously.`
`‘......All fantasy......is fictional......’`
`‘.........The Seven Sisters of Purgatory......are personifications of stakes for ceremonial sacrifices, mere creatures of fantasy......’`
`‘......They're actually paperweights...... ......They're actually paperweights......’`
`As they whispered curses that denied the Seven Sisters' existence, the goats lumbered closer.`
`"Get back, Purgatory troops!!`
` We'll cover you!"`
`"It's time you learned a lesson, goats!!"`
`The golden bows of the Chiester troops mowed down the wall of goats with a shower of bright golden bullets.`
`Some of the goats were torn to pieces, but some of them seemed completely unaffected.`
`Then, the goats who were uninjured all whispered as one.`
`‘.........The Chiester Sisters Imperial Guards...have Maria's rabbit dolls as their vessels......’`
`‘.........They're actually rabbit dolls...`
` Maria's imagination, fantasy, fictional beings.........’`
`‘......All of the crimes can be explained by mystery......`
` All fantasy is irrelevant......’`
`"Looks like—"`
`"We've got lots of people who won't accept the existence of magic!"`
`"And that means?!"`
`"No magical attacks will have any effect on them!"`
`"D‐does that mean all of our attacks will be completely useless?!"`
`"......{ruby:Endless Nine:99.9999999}...nyeh.`
` ......If they don't accept that we exist, our attacks can't hurt them nyeh."`
`"Is that possible...?!"`
`"We'll have to test it."`
`Ronove stepped forward, stamped on the floor twice, and a red barrier rose up in front of him.`
`The crowd of goats dashed into it with a terrifying force.`
`While some goats were blown away by it, several of them slipped right through the magical barrier.`
`‘......Ronove is a creature of magic, a creature of fiction......’`
`‘.........Genji is Ronove's vessel...`
` An imaginary version of Genji......’`
`"I see, ......so even my attacks will not affect some of them."`
`There was no longer any point in {f:5:Virgilia} trying out her own magic spear.`
`Some of the goats must also have decided that her existence was fictional as well, and she would no longer be able to hurt them.`
`......All of these great demons, great witches, ......high‐level furniture, and weapons,`
` ......were overcome with fear of the crowd that surrounded them, a crowd that would not be affected by any of their attacks...`
`"...Wh‐what are we going to do......?!"`
`"......W‐we'll keep fighting until the end.`
` You do not have permission to die in battle...!"`
`‘.........Fantasy is all fiction...... Fantasy is all fiction......`
` ......Fantasy is......all......fii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}ictioon!!!’`
`A shriek from one of the goats became a signal for the wall of them to break.`
`They pushed forward with gaping mouths and foul breath, each trying to reach their prey first, trying to return these fictional creatures to nothingness.`
`"Look out...!!"`
`{f:5:Virgilia} leapt in front of and held several of the Seven Sisters, who had fallen on their butts, overpowered by the ferocity of the approaching goats.`
`However, even {f:5:Virgilia} was a fictional creature to these goats.`
`They could chew through her like cotton candy.`
`"Madam, quickly...!!"`
`Ronove threw himself at the oncoming goats.`
`Even he would be chewed apart easily.`
` Knowing this, Ronove leapt forward.`
`"......Even if my magic no longer functions,`
` ......I am still the fiercely passionate and loyal man I always was.`
` ......And furthermore, did you expect that I would simply sit by and watch a lady die?"`
`‘.........Ronove is fantasy...... Ronove is fantasy......’`
`Ronove slammed his right fist into the side of a goat's face.`
`As soon as he pulled it back, he swung his left leg into the goat's gut, then spun around into a reverse roundhouse that caught the goat again.`
`".....................Hmph."`
`Ronove knew.`
` ......He could do less damage than a mosquito bite against those who didn't accept his existence.`
`This was what it meant to face an anti‐magic defense of {ruby:Endless Nine:99.9999999}...`
`‘.........Ronove is fantasy......a fiction......an illusion......!!’`
`The goat swung its log‐like fist with a sound like a storm.`
`Ronove dodged by a hair.`
`......If he had been an instant slower, the massive arm would have crushed his head like glass.`
`"Ronove...!!`
` Stop this, run...!!"`
`"I, Ronove,`
` cannot help but rise to the challenge when I see a lady in a pinch.`
` A bad habit of mine."`
`Ronove grinned and tried to act tough.`
`He had already abandoned everything.`
`There was nothing he could do here and now...except become a shield to buy time.`
`He had already chosen to abandon his life for this.`
`‘......Ronove is fantasy...... He cannot be real... He cannot be real......’`
`‘.........Those of fantasy do not exist...... Do not exist......’`
`‘......Fantasy is all...pukespittle...pukespittle......’`
`The goats kept coming, trying to feast on Ronove.`
`None had any pretensions of making this a one‐on‐one fight.`
`{n}Nothing mattered except chewing apart fantasy.`
` Even just a nibble.`
`As they gnashed those ruthless jaws and fangs, they gathered around Ronove......`
`"......Ggh.........!"`
`Ronove's foot hit something, and he stumbled.`
`In the same instant, several massive arms reached out and lifted him up.`
`"R‐Ronove‐samaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`"What are you doing, Chiesters? Shoot them!!"`
`".........We would've done that already if it'd have any effect nyeh......"`
`"Everyone, please stand back.`
` ......I should be able to buy you some time as they savor my flesh.`
` However, I think they'll find that Ronove has quite a few little bones in him."`
`An elbow rammed itself into the massive, hideous jaws that were trying to chew Ronove's head.`
`Of course, the goat did moan, but that did nothing but deprive just one goat of his right to the first bite of Ronove's head.`
`Many jaws opened wide,`
` ......trying to crush him and throw him down into those heartless stomachs, which would permit no heartwarming fantasies to exist......`
`‘.........I won't accept fantasy... Won't accept......’`
`‘......Explaining everything with mystery is possible...... Possiblllle......’`
`‘Fantasy is pukespittlllllle, everything is mysteryyyyyyyy...!!’`
`All of the many arms lifting Ronove up were sliced off.`
`The Seven Sisters used this chance to fly forward and grab Ronove, dragging him back.`
`".........Which of you......mentioned {f:5:mystery}?"`
`"Is Dlanor's blade effective?!"`
`"I see, if the opponents are calling it a mystery...!"`
`Blood‐red longsword in hand, Dlanor slowly walked forward.`
`Behind her walked Will, tapping his back with his black blade.`
`"......Well, if you don't think it's a fantasy,`
` ......then let's hear what your theories are."`
`"I cannot wait to hear your {f:5:opinions}."`
`The crowd of goats stepped back.`
`Though they had been so vicious against the fantasy creatures, they stepped back when faced with this pair wielding swords of mystery.`
`"......There have been a great many locked room murders on this game {f:5:board}.`
` Choose whichever you please, and we will parry all of your {f:5:attacks}."`
`"No.`
` ......We don't have to defend anything."`
`"......{f:5:Indeed}.`
` .........A mystery is always the source of the {f:5:challenge}.`
` ......Why should we be forced to play {f:5:defense}?"`
`"Do you guys get it yet?"`
`{a:c:You are the ones in the hot seat now.}`
`Blue truth cut the goats apart.`
`That blue truth dwelt within each and every one of the riddles in Beato's games so far.`
`What about the locked room with the chain, first game, second twilight?`
`{n}What about the locked room of the chapel, second game, first twilight?`
`{n}What about the trick to killing Nanjo, third game, ninth twilight?`
`There was no end to the blades.`
`The countless riddles {f:5:Beatrice} left behind became blades, "challenges" that tore the goats apart.`
`If they wanted to deny fantasy, ......they would have to make a counterargument.`
`They would have to deal with every single trick as a mystery.`
`However, although the goats spoke words of anti‐fantasy, most of them had prepared no answer for the mystery.`
`Well, every now and then, there was a goat who did have an answer.`
`‘......S‐someone outside the Ushiromiya family was hiding on the island, and......’`
`"Knox's 1st! It is forbidden for the culprit to be anyone not mentioned in the early part of the {f:5:story}!!"`
`‘......There were multiple culprits all working separately, and it just happened to look like a single culprit......’`
`"Van Dine's Rule #12.`
` There must be but one true culprit."`
`‘......Y‐you mean...everything but that is......f‐...forbidden......?!’`
`"Boring, right? To have a genre like that.`
` Personally,`
` I think mysteries should be more flexible."`
`‘......The Ten Knox Commandments......and the Twenty Van Dine Rules......a‐...are behind the times......’`
`‘The definition of the mystery genre is......changing with the era......I think...’`
`"Tch.`
` They're getting rebellious."`
`"Perhaps we are behind the {f:5:times}."`
`"In that case, let's see if you have any theories that can satisfy us."`
`".........{f:5:Come}!!"`
`The whole crowd of goats charged them.`
`In their fangs, each of them carried theories to crush Beato's locked rooms.`
`The bodies of these goats were different than the ones who had become corpses so easily just now.`
`They had mystery‐style answers to several locked rooms.`
`So, it would take several blade hits to deal them a fatal wound.`
`However, Beato had left many blades behind.`
` All of them were exceedingly sharp.`
`So, the pair of Inquisitors didn't think of this as a desperate battle.`
`This was mystery.`
`The goal of a mystery is to use all your imagination and knowledge to challenge each of its riddles head on.`
`Doing this is the greatest enjoyment of the mystery genre.`
`So they laughed.`
` Both Will and Dlanor laughed.`
`With smiles of admiration at the theories the goats had put everything they had into, they countered with blades from all the locked rooms.`
`The crowd of goats was no longer an encirclement, but a great wave threatening to swallow the pair up.`
`And yet, the pair repelled the enemy without giving an inch.`
`They resisted firmly, cutting through the tsunami of wailing goats.`
`It was like an ice‐breaking ship knocking a path through a frozen sea.`
`‘......They entered the locked room through a hidden passage that no one else could use, and......’`
`"Knox's 3rd! It is forbidden for hidden passages to {f:5:exist}!!"`
`‘......After the hidden passage was used, it was welded shut and became unusable, so no hidden passages existed at the time of the inspection...’`
`"Knox's 8th! It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not {f:5:presented}!!"`
`‘......These are all fake murders, and no one is actually dead......`
` So, all locked rooms were constructed by the so‐called victims......’`
`"?!"`
`Dlanor hesitated for just an instant.`
`After all, this clichéd and simple theory managed to get around both Beato's locked rooms and the Knox Decalogue.`
`Dlanor saw nothingness inside the goats' massive jaws......`
`‘.........Nngghkkk............kk.........!!’`
`"Van Dine's Rule #7.`
` It is forbidden to have a crime without a corpse."`
`Surely, the jaws of that goat had closed over Dlanor's head.`
`However, the upper and lower jaw were no longer connected, ......so the upper half slid off to the side.`
`"Look like even the great Knox never forbade fake murders."`
`"There are many splendid mysteries besides {f:5:murder}."`
`The goats didn't give the pair enough time to have a nice, long chat about mystery.`
`The next massive figure immediately enveloped them.`
`Will's blade drew a diagonal slash across its chest, but it only cut through its clothes, leaving no wound.`
`"............?!`
` The Twenty Wedges don't work on this one."`
`Dlanor also hit it with her longsword, but still, it just cut its clothes without leaving a mark on its body.`
`Could it be that this goat......`
`had a theory that didn't violate Knox or Van Dine......?!`
`‘......Knox and Van Dine are meaningless......`
` All locked rooms can be undone by a single solution......`
` .........Because......’`
`In an attempt to stop the goat from saying any more, Will and Dlanor hit it with blades from every locked room, as well as stakes from the Ten Commandments and the Twenty Rules, but none of it had any effect.`
`Slowly, the goat clenched its massive fists together, ......and raised them up high.`
`‘......Because, .........because......!!’`
`"Will...!!!"`
`With a roar, Will slammed into the goat giant with his body.`
`Though its massive bulk bent back slightly, Will was still leaping into a deathtrap.`
`However, if he hadn't done so, he wouldn't have been able to protect Dlanor.`
`The goat grabbed Will.`
`{n}It lifted him up and held him high in the air.`
`It was like a little kid showing off his favorite toy and waving it around...`
`"Let's hear your theory.`
` .........If I'm to hear a great theory before I die, it'll be a fitting end for me."`
`‘......Van Dine and Knox are useless for making theories......’`
`"Gyagg......gghh....gghhh......!"`
`The goat's massive hands closed on Will like a vise.`
`{n}All the bones in Will's body creaked.`
`"......Let's hear...your theory.`
` ......Guh, ......aah......"`
`‘There is no need...for a theory......’`
`".........What...?"`
`‘Because...making theories for any of {f:5:Beatrice}'s games...is a waste of time......’`
`"What do you mean......gggyahh......!"`
`‘......This isn't an orthodox mystery, so thinking about it is just a waste of time...`
` I won't accept {f:5:Beatrice}'s games......as a mystery...`
` ......There are no answers to the tricks.`
` ......It's all, all......just an illuuuuusion......’`
`"......................................."`
`‘.........?!?!’`
`"......Thinking.........is just a waste of time......?"`
`‘...Gg.........gwhh—’`
`Will's head was lowered, so his face couldn't be seen.`
` However, the arm of the goat holding him was shaking.`
`The embrace of those log‐sized arms with superhuman strength......was being slowly pushed away by Will's shaking arms......`
`".........Thinking is just a waste of time......?`
` You say that......and call yourself a mystery fan......?"`
`‘Gwah...ooh..................’`
`".........Mystery is like chivalry.`
` You fight with the noble rules that you've created, with pride in the stance you've taken.`
` ......Is it worth being a coward if it'll help you win? Does losing make the whole fight meaningless if you fought with everything you had?`
` ......It isn't about winning and losing, ...it's about applauding the will to fight even in the most dire circumstances..."`
`‘...Guh, ghh, ghh, .........gggg......!!!’`
`The goat's arms were now spread wide, and it looked as though Will was now the one pushing it back.`
`Will's face was covered in shadow and couldn't be seen.`
`".........People like you, ......who call themselves mystery fans even though they never even try to solve it like a mystery.......`
` You're the ones I really can't stand!!!"`
`Will slammed his forehead into the goat's now unprotected head.`
`"If you call yourself a mystery fan, be proud to join a battle of wits!!`
` If you call yourself a mystery fan, it's about time you realized!`
` Giving up is nothing to brag abo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}out!!!"`
`Will headbutted the goat over and over again.`
`His forehead was gushing blood, torn apart by the goat's fangs, but he kept on headbutting.`
`Van Dine and Knox may be behind the times.`
`{n}The mystery genre does progress with time, just like the world around it.`
`However, there's one thing that must never change.`
`That is...pride.`
`What is a knight proud of?`
`{n}Not victory.`
`{n}He's proud of the courage that lets him stand up to anyone without fear.`
`Will couldn't forgive the kind of coward who could turn tail from a fight and then brag about it.`
`People who call themselves mystery fans but who have no pride were the only ones Will just couldn't bear.`
`The goat, unable to put up with this anymore, threw Will down to the floor.`
`Then, he lifted his fists again, determined to crush Will to pieces this time.`
`"Bring it!`
` You probably will beat me to a pulp,`
` but that'll be no victory for you.`
` ......You'll destroy your own pride with your own hands!!"`
`‘......Pointless, pointless......`
` ......This is no mystery, so why make theories? ......Thinking is just a waste of time, useless, useless, useless, die, die, die......’`
`A fist like a cannonball swinging down towards him......was the very last thing Will saw before he shut his eyes.`
`{a:c:`
`"If you stop thinking—"}`
`"......!"`
`"In this game, that means you lose."`
`Battler smashed his fist into the goat's mouth......and smashed teeth bounced off the celling.`
`"{f:5:Battler}‐sama...!"`
`"If you stop thinking, it means you've given up on the story being a mystery.`
` Which means......as far as you're concerned, this game is a fantasy."`
`Battler lifted up his arm.`
` Realizing this was a signal, Lucifer and Chiester00 jumped.`
`"If you've stopped thinking, you don't deserve to be an actor on the stage.`
` Stop trying to sound smart, go sit in the audience, and stuff your mouth with popcorn."`
`The goat lifted his fist again, then swung it down at Battler like a hammer.`
`"......If you've surrendered to fantasy!!"`
`"That just makes you another target nyeh...!"`
`"It's the same as acknowledging that we exist......"`
`"Begin recognition of hostile elements...!!`
` Mark all targets vulnerable to magical attacks in our HMDs!!"`
`"Kids who surrender to fantasy get to deal with us!!"`
`"......And if you have a theory, we will hear it {f:5:out}."`
`"We'll welcome those people with open arms.`
` ......Out of respect for them, we won't hold anything back!"`
`"Oh, but it would seem that this is {f:5:Battler}‐sama's time to shine."`
`".........While I would like to listen to all your favorite theories, both mystery and fantasy,`
` ......this isn't your game right now.`
` ......No matter how much you future fragments try to deny us, this is no time for me to be defeated......"`
`A golden glint gathered in Battler's hand.`
`It was so bright that the whole hall was bathed in gold.`
`Golden butterflies flitted about, as though the whole hall was being swallowed up by the Golden Land.`
`Battler lifted......his golden longsword high.`
`".........Feel free to challenge Beato's game as a mystery or a fantasy.`
` I welcome it.`
` But know this. ......I'm not gonna let you deny this final game of mine.`
` ............Feel the shame of your indiscretion...of impugning the honor of those who have passed away."`
`A slice of the golden longsword flooded the hall with a sea of golden light.`
`Then, the whole group of goats filling the hall with noise turned into clouds of gold butterflies and scattered.`
`......Even so, only about a hundred of them had been wiped out.`
`Before long, the massive crowds of goats outside would probably come pouring in like seawater through a hole in the bottom of a ship.`
`"......Just a bit longer until the seal is finished.`
` Sorry, but I'll have to ask you to hold out here a bit longer."`
`"Of course, Lord {f:5:Battler}!"`
`"Otherwise, we wouldn't get to show off!"`
`"You know, you two could try fighting just a little."`
`"But—"`
`"We're—"`
`""Just the MCs!!""`
`Their excessively blunt refusal drew a few strained smiles.`
`{n}However, it had lessened the tension in the room just a bit.`
`"{f:5:Battler}‐sama, leave this to us!"`
`"We won't allow the corrosion to proceed any further!"`
`"And not one of us will be left behind."`
`"Of {f:5:course}.`
` We are all precious pieces on Lord {f:5:Battler}'s game {f:5:board}."`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory, the Chiester Sisters troops, and everyone else nodded forcefully.`
`"Yeah.`
` I'm counting on all of you...!!`
` We'll definitely protect this final game I made for Ange!!"`
`"They're managing to hold their ground down below!"`
`"The door to the Golden Land is still opening slowly.`
` It will still take some time though."`
`"There you have it.`
` We'd better start buying some time ourselves...!"`
`The sea of goats that covered the ground below them was jostling about more and more.`
`......By now, even the sea surrounding the island had disappeared.`
`The horizon was gone, ......and the chewed up island was now floating on an eerie emptiness like space.`
`The goats that flooded the edges of Rokkenjima seemed to be spilling off the sides.`
`"Looks like that's it for this game board......"`
`"As long as there's a Game Master and pieces,`
` the game board can always be laid out again.`
` As long as you have two people together, you can create any sort of game."`
`"......True. ........................ Where on Earth is Ange...?"`
`"Where did you hide it?"`
`"That's right, ......the chapel...!`
` What's happened to the chapel?!"`
`"It's still there...!"`
`The chapel looked like a white building floating in the pitch‐black sea of goats.`
`......Yes.`
` This was strange.`
`There was no way those goats, who consumed everything, would go out of their way to avoid just the chapel.`
`"That's where Ange is...!"`
`Outside the chapel was a sea of goats.`
`Very soon, the earth around the chapel would be eaten away, and it would probably end up floating on nothingness.`
`The rampage of the goats, as they devoured everything and chanted the tragedy they imagined with one voice, truly made a lot of noise.`
`However, none of that reached the inside of the chapel.`
`Ange finally broke the magic seal on the entrance and stepped inside......`
`The seal was supposed to be unbreakable by anyone.`
`However, in the face of {f:5:Ange Beatrice}, Witch of Truth, the one who sought the truth and could sweep aside all forces that prevented her from finding it,`
` no barrier was absolute...`
`"....................................`
` ......There it is."`
`A single book, tightly locked, rested on the altar.`
`{n}It was the hidden diary that Ushiromiya Eva had written in even in her later years.`
`The Book of the Single Truth.`
`......It was the one {f:5:Featherine} had shown her in the world of 1998.`
`This time, I have the key.`
`I gripped the gold key that sat in my pocket, ......the key Onii‐chan gave me.`
`As I approached the altar, I saw that the Book of the Single Truth was wrapped in a strange bending of the light.`
`".........So, this is that seal of the Game Master that {f:5:Bernkastel} talked about."`
`The Book of the Single Truth was sealed in something like a crystal.`
`{n}It was a seal made by the Game Master's authority.`
`This was on a different level than the breakable magic seal on the chapel door.`
`No matter how Ange used her power as a Witch of Truth, this couldn't be broken by anyone except the Game Master.`
`......However, this time, Battler wasn't the only Game Master.`
`"Hmph.`
` ......So sorry, Onii‐chan.`
` {f:5:Bernkastel} is also a Game Master.`
` ......I just need to take it with me and have her break the seal."`
`Ange slowly approached the altar......`
`"......Will Ange really do as you say?"`
`"This is my little sister we're talking about, ......so yeah, probably not."`
`"Then what will we do?"`
`"Looks like we've got nothing to go on but brute force...!"`
`At that moment, a fierce impact hit the pair of them.`
`Beato was flung away, and Battler was sealed inside a massive crystal that extended up to the heavens.`
`"Damn, what the hell is this?!!"`
`"Battler...!! Gghh, what is this?!"`
`It was a barrier, a massive cage of crystal.`
`Battler was shut inside a crystal cage like a tower, so large that you had to look up to see the top.`
`"Beato, I need you to take care of Ange...!"`
`"What will you do?!`
` Can you break this from the inside all by yourself?!`
` Is this.........a locked room barrier?!`
` Who could have—"`
`".........There's only one person who'd challenge me with a locked room.`
` ......Looks like our final guest has finally arrived."`
`"You don't mean........."`
`"Go, and take care of Ange...!"`
`Beato left Battler to handle this on his own and headed for the chapel.`
`{n}Battler took a deep breath, then smiled daringly......`
`"......I've been waiting.`
` ......Was it boring in that depths of oblivion place?"`
`The answer was a laugh.`
`......Yeah, that's right.`
` That laugh is enough.`
`"Looks like you're doing well."`
`".........It wasn't boring.`
` ......After all, I believed."`
`"I'll bet you did.`
` ......I believed too."`
`Battler flung off the cape of the territory lord.`
`It would only get in the way.`
`And, it would be a rude way to welcome his final guest.`
`"Those dark depths.`
` ......Just the perfect place to think up mysteries to challenge you with when we next met."`
`"So, this crystal cage is the ring for our duel.`
` A chain deathmatch with nowhere to run."`
`"......Now that you mention it,`
` we're always fighting over locked rooms with chains."`
`"Then let's use that.`
` Make it a real chain deathmatch."`
`"I'm prepared, but what about you?"`
`"......I am.`
` ......I told you, didn't I?`
` I believed too."`
`At the same time, they both brandished their mysteries, sealing the other in a chained locked room.`
`"Come, Furudo Erikaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa!!!"`
`"Entertain me, Bwattleer‐shwa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aann{-}n{-}n{-}nn!!!"`
`At the same time, they were both sealed inside a locked room locked with a chain.`
`Of course, it was easy to set and unset the chain from the inside.`
`However, stepping into their opponent's chained room would be difficult.`
`They were fighting to the death with two chain locked rooms at once.`
`There could be no better locked‐room duel for this pair, who had battled with theories concerning chained rooms so often.`
`"{p:2:Furudo Erika committed suicide, died in an accident, died of illness, died by some reason other than homicide}!!"`
`"{p:1:It wasn't a suicide, it wasn't an accidental death, it wasn't a death by illness! I really was killed by you, Battler‐san}!!!"`
`"{p:2:It was a murder committed by slipping poison gas through the crack of the door, by filling the room with water and drowning you, by sucking the oxygen out of the room and making you suffocate}!!"`
`"{p:1:There was no poison gas, there was no drowning, there was no death by suffocation}!!"`
`"Hahahaha, ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!`
` A locked room murder with poison gas? Death by drowning? Suffocation?!`
` *giggle*giggle*, aha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"`
`"Crazy, right? It's funny, isn't it?"`
`"<Good>!!`
` {p:2:Ushiromiya Battler committed suicide, he died in an accident, he died by illness}!!`
` Time for me to test your locked room!"`
`"Red truth!!`
` {p:1:Ushiromiya Battler was stabbed to death!!`
` Let's say the weapon was a knife, stuck right into his back}!!"`
`"<Good>!!`
` Nothing beats a classic locked room!!"`
`"Then why don't you try it too?!"`
`"I'll take that challenge with the red truth!!`
` {p:1:Furudo Erika was stabbed to death!`
` The weapon was a knife, stuck right in her back}!!"`
`"Interesting!!`
` I'll tear your locked room to bii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}its!!"`
`".........What's this supposed to be?"`
`"Battler is busy at the moment with other business.`
` For now, I shall be your opponent."`
`Beato had sealed the chapel with a locked room barrier.`
`Unless that riddle was smashed with blue truth, Ange wouldn't be able to leave the chapel.`
`After shrugging impatiently, Ange finally faced Beato.`
`"Is this the first time I've fought you directly......?"`
`"Oh, is it now...?`
` Very well, let's see what you've got.`
` However, Battler isn't here at the moment.`
` .........When he's not around, I sometimes forget to hold back."`
`"What a coincidence.`
` I feel the same."`
`"{p:1:I killed you inside a perfect locked room, with windows, doors, and all other methods of entry or exit blocked}!!"`
`"Okay, I'll play along with your game. Repetition requested!!!"`
