`Two silhouettes could be seen in the chapel.`
`{n}A big brother...and his little sister.`
`The big brother who would never return from that day twelve years in the past, and the little sister who waited all alone twelve years in the future.`
`However, the big brother knew everything, understood everything.`
`{n}And the little sister knew nothing, understood nothing.`
`So, no matter how much time passed, the little sister remained as the girl she had been twelve years before.`
`She remained a six‐year‐old girl forever......`
`Her sobs into her big brother's chest finally subsided......`
`She quietly waited for his next words.`
`After patting her head gently, the big brother fished around inside his shirt pocket.`
`Then, ......he took something out.`
`"Are you listening, Ange?`
` Take good care of this."`
`".........What is it...?`
` .........A key...?"`
`Battler took a large key attached to a necklace out of his pocket, then held it out to Ange.`
`It was large enough to cover Battler's entire palm,`
` and little Ange probably wouldn't even be able to wrap her hand all the way around it.`
`The key glittered gold and had a beautiful, intricate design.`
`Its weight alone made it clear that this key was something very important.`
`Battler put the necklace around Ange's neck.`
`"This precious key is yours alone, Ange."`
`"What's it for......?"`
`"The time to use it will come soon.`
` When it does, you'll have to decide for yourself.`
` ......Understand?"`
`......Of course, she didn't have a clue what Battler was talking about.`
`But she did realize that he was telling her to take good care of this key.`
` So, Ange nodded, at least in response to that part.`
`In her hand, the key had felt heavy.`
` However, now that it was around her neck, it felt as light as an ordinary necklace.`
`How strange.`
`"Okay, let's go."`
`"Where......?"`
`She had been sure that her brother was about to sit down.`
`Just a second ago, he had said that he'd tell her what happened on Rokkenjima that day.`
`She had thought that he would tell her here......`
`"On that day, on that island...`
` What happened?"`
`"Weren't you about to tell me that, Onii‐chan...?"`
`"Oh, I will.`
` I'll tell the story and let you listen.`
` ......However, it might be the kind of thing you can't really feel if you just hear about it from someone else."`
`".........What do you mean...?"`
`"What you really want...isn't to know what happened on that island on that day."`
`......So, ......he does understand, after all.`
`What happened on that island that day?`
`Trying to answer that question was all I was capable of, so I wished for nothing more.`
`......But, if I could...`
`I'd......want to go there.`
`To that island.`
` On that day.`
`To Rokkenjima, on that day I couldn't go... To the Ushiromiya family mansion.`
`Mom and Dad.`
` All my cousins, all my relatives.`
` And...everyone else.`
`I want to go back......to that island on that day.`
`So, I've always remained the way I was on that day.`
`{n}My heart and soul stopped, stuck as a six‐year‐old's forever...`
`"......I want to go back there."`
`"I know."`
`"Mom, Dad, Onii‐chan.`
` Everyone.`
` .........I want to go......to where everyone is......"`
`"That's why......I've decided to invite you there."`
`".........Huh...?"`
`"I'm the Game Master now.`
` Only those who know everything about the game board can open it up and invite pieces in.`
` ......So, I'll invite you to come to the game board."`
`"You'll......take me to Rokkenjima......on that day......"`
`"That's right.`
` I'll invite you to the Rokkenjima of 1986."`
`"Will I be able to see them?`
` Everyone......?"`
`"Of course."`
`"Even though......my memory is vague, ......and I can't remember anyone's faces clearly..."`
`"You'll remember soon enough.`
` ...And, though it'll be a reunion after twelve years for you,`
` ......it'll only have been a short gap for the rest of us.`
` ......Everyone will welcome you.`
` Everyone will welcome you back from the distant future."`
`"Will I......be able to stay there forever......?"`
`This way, ......I'll be able to be with everyone forever.`
`{n}This is the goal I'm supposed to reach......`
`"Ange, listen to me carefully."`
`But Battler spoke in an admonishing tone.`
`{n}As though warning me that this dream would not be granted...`
`"The Rokkenjima family conference only lasts one night.`
` Although, the typhoon stopped the boat from coming that day, so it went on for one night more."`
`"So, when the typhoon passes, ......I'll have to leave the island again...?"`
`"......Not exactly.`
` The decision is yours, Ange."`
`"........................"`
`"You have to decide that yourself."`
`......I understand, of course.`
`I don't exist on that island on that day.`
`It's a miracle just to be invited there like this.`
`Just the two days before the typhoon passes.`
` Just getting those two days to myself is already the sort of miracle that will never come again.`
`If I'm greedy enough to ask for more, that faint miracle might vanish.`
`......Even though I thought this, my young heart, which was still six years old, wasn't satisfied with that short‐lived miracle...`
`"I don't want to leave."`
`".........I know."`
`"I'll be with everyone forever.`
` I'll stay with my family.`
` Even if you tell me I have to head back, ......I'll stay on Rokkenjima."`
`"You can stay or you can leave, but it's not as though one of those is "the right choice".`
` That's not how it is, Ange."`
`"......Even so, you'll let me choose......?"`
`"Yes.`
` That's what the key is for."`
`Battler touched the glittering key that hung from Ange's neck.`
`"I've...already made my decision."`
`"You don't have to decide now.`
` The time to choose will come soon.`
` ......When it does, you must use your honest heart to choose how you'll use that key."`
`"..........................."`
`"You don't need to listen to anything I tell you.`
` You're free to decide however you like.`
` ............However,`
` if you're a good kid, and if you can trust your big brother..."`
`"......Then what......?"`
`"Then believe everything I tell you."`
`"Believe......everything..."`
`"That will lead to the best choice for you.`
` Listen to my words and believe everything I say.`
` ......Can you do that?"`
`"............I don't know."`
`"That's good enough.`
` Just believe whatever you want to.`
` That's also for you to decide."`
`"......If I don't believe you,`
` ......will I wake up from this dream...?"`
`"That won't happen.`
` So don't worry."`
`For some reason, Ange was suspicious of her brother...and scared of him.`
`Her wish was to remain on that island on that day, together with her family, forever.`
`......She was afraid that, once she got her two miraculous days,`
` ......her brother might tell her to be satisfied with those, and ask her to return to twelve years in the future all alone.`
`"I already told you.`
` ......You can go, or you can stay.`
` There is no right decision.`
` That's for you to decide.`
` And you don't need to make your decision right now."`
`"And no one will force me to make either choice...?"`
`"Of course."`
`"You won't tell me.........to go back to the future......?"`
`".........There is a choice that I want you to choose.`
` ......I want you to reach that decision by yourself.`
` So, though I hope you make a certain choice, I will respect your decision."`
`"And I've already told you.`
` I've already made my choice."`
`"And I told you.`
` Now isn't the time to choose."`
`"When will it be time?"`
`"The key will tell you."`
`The large, gold key hung from Ange's neck.`
`Her small hand held it tightly......`
`.........At that moment, she noticed a book lying on the chapel's altar.`
`The book had a lock on it, and was sealed so that it could not be read without a key.`
`Ange looked between the key hanging at her chest and the book on the altar.`
`".........Will this key unlock that book?"`
`"Don't touch that."`
`His sudden, forceful response made Ange flinch.`
`Battler, realizing he had scared Ange, softened his expression.`
`"Come on, let's go.`
` .........I'm inviting you to come back to October 4th, 1986."`
`"Okay."`
`Battler held out his hand, and Ange gripped it tightly.`
`Then, they started walking.`
`A brilliant light lay beyond the chapel's door.`
`That blinding light peeked in through the cracks around the door.`
`......The brother and sister began to walk through to the other side......`
`{a:c:`
`Welcome back, Ange.`
` And after this, that will be it.}`
`{a:c:`
`Just for you, I'll open this game board...{n}......one final time......}`
