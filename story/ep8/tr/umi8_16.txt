`{f:5:Eva} had indeed broken the magic circle around the key beforehand.`
`By the time Battler and Ange reached it, it was crumbling like the sand in an hourglass.`
`They tried punching and kicking it to make it break faster, but nothing they did hastened the process.`
`"......It looks like she broke it a while ago,`
` ...but it'll still probably take some time before it's gone..."`
`"Just a bit longer, I think.`
` ......If we can just buy time for five more minutes......"`
`Judging by the speed the magic circles were crumbling and the general appearance of the whole scene, it looked like it would be over soon.`
`However, as things stood, even if it was just five more minutes, would that be soon {i:enough}?`
`They turned around.`
`......Beyond the bookshelf ravine.........was a universe.`
`Even for Battler, who had seen Beato's fights many times over,`
` the battle between {f:5:Lambdadelta} and {f:5:Bernkastel} was so mind‐defying that he couldn't think of a single word to describe it.`
`When he finally managed to find a word, it was "a universe".`
`With each development in the battle between {f:5:Lambdadelta} and {f:5:Bernkastel}, a universe was created between the pair of them.`
`A Big Bang took place, a universe was created, galaxies beyond number were born and erased, born and erased.`
`Then, just when it seemed that a Big Crunch had occurred and the universe had met its demise, there was another Big Bang, and another universe was created.`
`It was like watching gods playing.`
`The two witches created and destroyed worlds over and over again,`
` almost as though two Creators were fighting to prove that their universe was the right one.`
`If you let your guard down in the slightest, ......then just watching this would steal your soul. That's how it felt.`
`"......We'll be able to get the key back any second now.`
` ......Then, we'll be able to go back to the Golden Land with the fragment {f:5:Lambdadelta} gave us, right...?"`
`"Go back as soon as you get the key.`
` I can't leave {f:5:Lambdadelta} on her own."`
`"You're going to jump into that fight?!"`
`"I can't leave her on her own."`
`"..........................."`
`"Their fight may defy common sense.`
` ......However, they're perfectly and evenly matched.`
` So...`
`......if anyone jumps in, even a single weak {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} like me, .........something might break."`
`A perfect balance maintained by two great powers can easily break by adding even a little strength to one side.`
`However, actually rushing in there to add that little bit of strength would be literally suicidal.`
`Like a moth flying into a furnace.`
`{n}It might burn up before it even reaches it.`
`"Once you get the key, go straight back to the Golden Land.`
` .........We don't know how long they can hold out, remember?"`
`"......I can't go back alone, ......not when everyone is fighting."`
`"That's right, this is your fight.`
` So fight.`
` ......Though you regret not dying with everyone else, you must overcome that feeling and live in the future.`
` That's what you decided to do, right?"`
`".................................!"`
`Ange had no words to respond with.`
`......Her brother and everyone else would probably die.`
` So, she wanted to die in the same place and the same time as everyone else.`
`However, that would not be permitted, and she knew she mustn't wish for it.`
`She had already made up her mind.`
`She had sworn......to live in the future, without turning back to look at everyone's deaths.`
`"When you get back to the Golden Land, show the key to Beato.`
` Beato will show you two doors.`
` ......Then, she'll give you an easy puzzle, and tell you to open one of them.`
` ......That's...the last game on my game board."`
`"......Two...doors......"`
`"Of the two, one will lead you to the future.`
` ......Don't worry.`
` I'm sure you won't choose the wrong one now.`
` Also, once you go through it, don't turn back until the door closes."`
`"Why can't I turn back?"`
`"Once the door closes, you won't be able to see our fate anymore.`
` ......In other words, we'll be shut inside the cat box."`
`"A fate inside a cat box......has endless truths."`
`"That's right.`
` We might've lost pathetically, or we might've made a miraculous comeback and survived.`
` In other words, if you, the Witch of the Future, are sent into the future without witnessing the end of our conflict, we'll still have a chance at victory."`
`"However, if you keep on looking at us, you'll see when we get annihilated.`
` That'll put the odds of our defeat at 100%.`
` So, to give us a miraculous victory, you must not turn back once you go through that door!`
` Got it?!!"`
`"Y‐......yeah........."`
`"So, I'll go and help {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` If you go back to the Golden Land after seeing me walk off like a hero, that's how my story will end for you."`
`"......The result of your battle will be sealed in the cat box.`
` ......So, you can never "lose"."`
`"Exactly.`
` So don't look back.`
` You'll have the key soon.`
` Go back to the Golden Land like your life depends on it.`
` ......So, real quick, I have one message for the you of the future.`
` Don't forget it, and engrave it into your heart!"`
`"Okay, ......okay......!!"`
`"......No matter what happens, never abandon the hopes that keep you alive.`
` All of us are always behind you.`
` ......If you just believe, we can even speak to you!`
` You hear me? Believe!`
` If one thing is certain, it's that miracles happen when you believe!"`
`At that moment, a massive explosion engulfed {f:5:Lambdadelta} and {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`Surely, one of them had landed a powerful blow.`
`There were no further explosions, ......so surely, that strike had decided the match...`
`When the smoke cleared, ......who would be left standing...?`
`The magic circle sealing the key still needed several minutes to dissolve...`
`"..................Are you...still there...?`
` My beloved......{f:5:Lambdadelta}......?"`
`All that came into sight.........was {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`There was no answering voice from {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
`If this was a sign of {f:5:Bernkastel}'s victory, it didn't cause her expression to grow any brighter.`
`"............Too bad, Lambda.`
` ......And I thought we'd be able to build a universe together.`
` ...It's too bad, really too bad."`
`......{f:5:Bernkastel} was still focusing all her nerves on the battle.`
`So, she took no notice of Battler and Ange by the key.`
`......However, she would probably notice soon.`
`{n}And then, there would be nowhere to run.`
`The last circle of the magic circle was starting to fade away.`
`However, almost cruelly, the final circle went slower than the rest...`
`Seeing that, any hopes that it would dissolve in a minute, or maybe a few dozen seconds,`
` ......were crushed absolutely.`
`Battler readied himself.`
`"......Well, this fight probably won't work out as well as the last one,`
` ......but it looks like I'm up now."`
`"Onii‐chan......"`
`"You're great, Ange.`
` I'm proud that you didn't try to stop me."`
`With tears still pouring down her face, ......Ange lovingly rubbed her cheek against the hand that had been patting her head.`
`"............I've got to gather the kitties again.`
` ......I thought Battler would be with her, but I don't see him for some reason.`
` ......After all, one guy like him would be about as annoying as a pebble in my shoe."`
`The smoke cleared completely, ......and they saw a huge cloud of candy bits floating around, ......like it was {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s corpse.`
`A star‐shaped cookie bounced off of {f:5:Bernkastel}'s head.`
`It was missing one of its points, giving it a lonely feeling.`
`".........{f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` ......Live with me.`
` ......We'll become a single universe, with you inside me."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} chewed the cookie...and swallowed it.`
`"This way, we'll always be together........`
` I love you, Lambda."`
`{a:c:`
`"Me too, Bern."}`
`{f:5:Bernkastel}'s stomach suddenly swelled like a balloon.`
`The bulge rose from her stomach to her throat, then exploded like a firework from her mouth.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} coughed up fireworks, sparks, and fragments of candy.`
`"You still haven't gotten out of your old cat habits?`
` .........You know you shouldn't eat snacks you find lying on the ground."`
`"La...mgu...ghkahh{0}khhh{0}khhk...dah...aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhh!!"`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} kept coughing and spitting up exploding fireworks.`
`The birth of a small universe from that sweet had hit her directly from the inside of her stomach.`
` Even {f:5:Bernkastel} couldn't withstand that.`
`As she repeatedly vomited fireworks so violently that it seemed her guts would spill out, her body flickered in and out of existence, and she glared at {f:5:Lambdadelta} with a terrifying expression.`
`Her body was flickering because she had taken so much damage that even maintaining her form was now difficult.`
`"How unbecoming, Bern.`
` Your form is in disarray."`
`"*cough*, *cough*hack*, uuuggghhh, ......Lambdaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ahhhkk, *cough*!!"`
`"I sort of felt like losing for a bit.`
` .........But I changed my mind.`
` If I became a single universe with you,`
` you wouldn't whisper to me of your love anymore."`
`".........True.`
` ......I'm not the type to give food to a fish I've already caught."`
`"I know.`
` That's why you shine so beautifully.`
` ......You'll lead others on, but never fawn on anyone, just like a proud queen of cats."`
`"I'll turn you into a cardboard box and make all your sides my scratching post!!"`
`"And I'll make you a shamisen, get bored after plucking one string, then put you in a cupboard and let the dust pile up on you!!!"`
`The goat tsunami had swallowed up everything, but sea spray was still flying about.`
`The reefs resisted the ocean trying to cover them, smashing waves left and right.`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory and the Inquisitors specialized at close‐range combat, and were rapidly building a mountain of corpses.`
`The witches fought hard too, but they would have preferred to fight at a distance if they could.`
`Just relying on fantasy creatures wouldn't be enough.`
`In these battle conditions, all of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s were thrust right into the center of the fight.`
`Everyone in the Ushiromiya family displayed a fighting spirit equal to the witches and guarded their backs.`
`Even {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s are not powerless.`
` They have guns.`
`If the goats supported fantasy, they could use these as the ultimate anti‐magic weapons.`
`If the goats supported mystery, they could use these in a much more obvious way.`
`Those .45 Long Colt bullets delivered fatal wounds to each and every goat they struck.`
`"You stubborn vermin!!`
` How long are you going to resist?! Will you just...! Lie down and...! Sink into your watery grave!! Ushiromiyaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa!!"`
`"If you tell an Ushiromiya to sink, you'll just make him fight all the harder!!`
` Little girl, you have no idea what the Ushiromiya family is!!"`
`"{i:You} were dead even {i:before} 1986!!`
` It's about time you stopped moving, gramps!!"`
`Erika's razor‐sharp scythe buried itself in Kinzo's chest.`
`It dug straight into his heart, but the daring smile on Kinzo's face didn't even falter.`
`"Hoh, ......and was my death ever witnessed by anyone outside the cat box?`
` I am indestructible...... INDESTRUCTIBLE!!"`
`A punch containing all of Kinzo's last spark of life sent Erika flying.`
`"Father, Father, are you okay?!!"`
`"March over my dead body and onward!!`
` An Ushiromiya never turns back!!"`
`As Erika tried to deliver the finishing blow, Krauss stepped in between them, blocking the way.`
`"......I will be your opponent in Father's place."`
`"Oh?`
` If it isn't the incompetent investing expert.`
` It's pretty impressive how you managed to find all the worst bets and lose your money so quickly."`
`"And yet, at least I remember to tie my shoes."`
`"Huh?"`
`Erika tried to look down at her own feet, ......but what she saw was Krauss's left fist.`
`"?!?!"`
`Krauss's left uppercut made Erika float in the air.`
` Not by magic, but by the simple laws of physics.`
`For an instant, Erika saw the moon......`
`"I may have been incompetent as an investor!!`
` However, any of my college friends will attest to my talent as a boxer!!`
` I will not allow you to discredit every part of the Ushiromiya family, little girl!!"`
`"You...damn......small fryyyyyyy!!!"`
`‘......Kanon is an illusion......`
` An illusion created by a lonely Jessica......’`
`"At the school festival,`
` I introduced Kanon‐kun to everyone!!`
` Saku, and Hina, and everyone else!!`
` All of my friends can testify to that!!`
` Don't make assumptions about our relationship based on your own imagination!!"`
`Jessica's body blow made the goat's massive body cave in.`
`"Splendidly done, Milady!`
` To think that you can wield such power in a tight spot like this...!"`
`"Well, sure I can!`
` That's 'cause, even if I died right now, I think I'd be cool with it.`
` ......This is the first time we've worked together, with you at my back.`
` Too bad it's not cutting the cake...!"`
`Jessica gave a embarrassed grin.`
` ......She looked even more relaxed than she had on the stage at the school festival.`
`"If we can't cut a cake, then let's cut something else."`
`"You always try to sound cool with every thing you say...!"`
`"But I like it that way!!"`
`The massive bodies that rushed at them, trying to deny their relationship and their very existence, had two choices: to be sliced or struck.`
`Each time one of those bodies hit the ground, it became proof that the two of them existed.`
`‘......Shannon is an illuuuuuuusion!`
` George is an anti‐social shut‐in!`
` Their love itself is an illusion and doesn't exiiiiiiist!!’`
`"George‐sama, look out!!!"`
`The goat's log‐sized fist buried itself in George's face.`
`They were in the middle of a tightly packed melee.`
` There was no way to dodge an unexpected attack like that.`
`‘............?!?!’`
`"......An anti‐social shut‐in, is it?`
` .........Very well.`
` Say what you wish about me."`
`George had indeed been hit with a fist right to the center of his face.`
`However, ......he didn't bend over backwards. Not even an inch.`
`The goat started to worry. What exactly had he hit?`
`Hadn't he punched a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} made of flesh......?`
`It was as though......he had slammed his fist into a steel wall......and it was his fist that was hurting...`
`However, ......the goat was too scared to move his fist from George's face.`
`After all, if he did, ......the expression on that face would probably be terrifying.`
`George's hand......knocked that fist away.`
`"You could probably get testimony from my old classmates from school.`
` ......Yes, I was an anti‐social person.`
` ......However, there's one more thing that they'll tell you, something far more important."`
`George was only grabbing the goat's massive fist in his tiny hand.`
`However, that fist was being crushed as though it had a vise around it......`
`Even though the other hand was so tiny, ......the goat couldn't even move its fist.`
`"......Ushiromiya George never fought for himself, no matter what happened to him.`
` ......He was a coward who ran away from all threats.`
` ......Everyone will tell you that.`
` .........However, they won't tell you that he never got into a fight."`
`I accepted the fact that someone as pathetic as me would be bullied.`
`"However!!`
` There were people who took my side in spite of all my flaws!!`
` And when THOSE people were bullied or harassed,`
` NEVER,`
` EVEN ONCE,`
` did I tolerate it!!!!"`
`The goat's broken teeth flew through the air.`
`{n}George's leg split the heavens.`
`‘......Sh‐......Shannon approached George for his money, and......’`
`A goat's filthy finger touched Shannon's back.`
`That finger......exploded and boiled away.`
`"My love for George‐san is true and pure.`
` ......George‐san must have kept all the letters I wrote him.`
` Read those, and you'll have your proof."`
`‘......Y‐......you can write anything in a letter...`
` ......The contents of a letter are no proof of true lo—’`
`A blazing red light charred the goat's entire body.`
`......Shannon slowly turned around, her face full of rage and contempt.`
`"Pitiful spectator, ignorant of love.`
` You have not even the capacity to read the hearts of others, much less a mystery.`
` ......Disappear......!!"`
`An absolute barrier rose up around Shannon, incinerating the goats around her with its intense heat.`
`"Kihihihi!`
` Yeah, maybe we are dead.`
` But that doesn't give anyone the right to criticize us!`
` No one can deny the love Mama and I shared...!!"`
`Maria grinned, showing her teeth, and performed her job without even looking at her hands.`
`Then, she gave the fully loaded rifle a rough toss up into the air.`
`".........Come and get some."`
`Rosa, who stood back‐to‐back with Maria, caught it without turning around.`
`No, that wasn't quite it.`
` Maria's throw had landed the gun directly into Rosa's already outstretched hand in a precise blind exchange.`
`Rosa's head was pointed at the ground......as she stroked the frigid trigger with her index finger.`
`"If any of you doubt my love for my daughter, ......step forward."`
`The crowd of goats, cowed by Rosa's ferocity, ......dared not approach.`
`"Then I will deny it.`
` ......Being the serial cheater you are, you were always off playing around with a man and leaving Maria all alone!!"`
`"Nothing like that is written anywhere in Maria's diary.`
` Kihi{0}hi{0}hihi."`
`"Y‐you should know better than anyone else...!!`
` Rosa didn't love you!`
` She was a total shithead of a mother who regretted even giving birth to you!!!!"`
`Erika peered at the unfeeling moon, ......the taste of metal in her mouth.`
`For a moment, she couldn't make sense of her new situation.`
`Was that cold feeling on her back......the ground?`
`Huh?`
` ......Why am I......lying down......?`
`And wasn't the moon full?`
` Why isn't it now...?`
`Come to think of it, ......my teeth...hurt.`
` ......There's something cold...and hard.`
`Then, she figured it out.`
`She was lying sprawled on the ground, with a gun barrel shoved into her mouth.`
`And the thing splitting the full moon.........was the angry king of wolves protecting its child.`
`"...............gahahk........."`
`The gun barrel exploded inside her mouth, shattering her medulla oblongata.`
`......But it was only her afterimage.`
`"What a terrifying woman you are. Are you really {y:0:Huma}{n:0:huma}—"`
`Having escaped death at the last moment by leaving an afterimage,`
` ......Erika was confronted at her new location by the glint of metal, which had been there even before she reappeared.`
`The fountain pen went right through Erika's eye, crushing it.`
`Of course, that was another afterimage.`
`However, when Erika escaped and reappeared somewhere else, a heel was already there waiting for her......`
`From the goats' perspective,`
` ......several afterimages of Erika seemed to have appeared at once......and all been taken out simultaneously by Rosa......`
`".........If you say that again, I'll have to get serious."`
`"Mama's really strong, kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!!"`
`"............Wh‐......what the hell......"`
`And so, Erika couldn't reappear anymore.`
`{n}At the very least, not within Rosa's range of attack.`
`Erika put a lot of distance between her and Rosa, reappearing in midair.`
`"......What.........are these people?!`
` What......the hell?!!`
` ............?!?!"`
`Erika's animal instincts made her turn her head slightly to the side just in time.`
`Where her head used to be, there was an odd shower of sparks.`
`It wasn't magic.`
` It was a real physical phenomenon cased by lead smashing against lead.`
`To think that two bullets shot from different angles......could have flown with impossible precision at where her head once was...`
`...so that both of them hit and bounced off each other like billiard balls.`
`"......Aw, so close."`
`"Sorry about that.`
` We're big fans of the whole "take out the boss first" strategy, you see."`
`"You know, we're pretty good at clay pigeons.`
` Flying along in a straight line probably isn't a good idea."`
`The two of them spun their rifles in exactly the same way at exactly the same time, reloading them in a way that put old westerns to shame,`
` then pointed them back up at where Erika was in the sky.`
`"Y‐`
`.........you monsteeeeers!!"`
`Once again, their accurate shots plunged through the forehead of Erika's afterimage, bouncing off each other like billiard balls with a shower of sparks.`
`This time, Erika appeared far behind them.`
`She had to admit it.`
` She had been forced to escape to a place outside the range of those guns fired by {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.`
`Then, the light from the moon was blocked.`
`The place that she had fled to so rapidly exploded, sending chunks of rubble flying.`
`A massive longsword had been plunged into the ground.`
` ......It was Dlanor's sword.`
`"......Oh......`
` If it isn't my old friend......!"`
`"...................................."`
`Erika had dodged it by a hair, ......but this bulky, brutal longsword was more of a cannonball shaped like a sword than something for cutting with.`
`Despite the successful dodge, the blast of air pressure made her eardrums throb.`
`Dlanor was serious.`
` She had seriously intended to smash Erika to bits.`
`"What's with the scary face?!!`
` Can't you try and act a bit, I don't know, cuter?!"`
`".........Do you find this {f:5:enjoyable}?`
` Destroying people's dreams and {f:5:illusions}?"`
`"Of course it's enjoyable!`
` What do you expect an intellectual rapist to do?!"`
`"You are an {f:5:evildoer}.`
` ......And yet, I used to believe you were the sort of evil that could be sympathized {f:5:with}."`
`"I never asked for your sympathy."`
`"......Not cutting you down immediately upon our {f:5:meeting}...`
` That sin of mine is what helped bring this day to {f:5:pass}!!"`
`Dlanor's hair bristled with rage.`
`Seeing this expression on the one she had once called a friend......pinned Erika to the spot.`
`"My {f:5:friend}.`
` ......Allow me to free you before you can {f:5:suffer}.`
` I will not allow you to bear any further {f:5:sins}!!!"`
`"Whoa, ......wai— ...............!!!"`
`The force of anger that welled from Dlanor's whole body struck Erika.`
`Or rather, the swirl of blasting wind from Dlanor's massive longsword sent her flying.`
`As Erika took leap after leap backwards to escape the bladed cannonball, it smashed apart the ground in the spots where she had just been.`
`So, it almost looked as though Erika herself was smashing the earth beneath her with each backwards jump.`
`"Dlanor............"`
`"......Friend of mine,`
` rest in {f:5:peace}!!!"`
`Once more, the great longsword split the air and pulverized the ground.`
`However, this time, Erika was nowhere to be seen.`
` ......Where had she escaped to?`
`This time, Erika had broken the barrier of the Golden Land and landed on a ship whose bow was barely in sight.`
`......Practically speaking, she had run away.`
`Fully aware of this, Erika howled, her face contorted with humiliation.`
`Her shoulders heaved with her breathing, ......and she had even forgotten to fix her hair......`
`The scythe fell from her hand and landed with a clank to the floor.`
`{n}That sound brought her back to her senses.`
`"You good‐for‐nothing goats!!`
` What are you standing around staring for?!!`
` Open the gun ports!!`
` Load concept negation explosive rounds!!`
` Don't worry about aiming, just fii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}ire!!!"`
`The warships that had flown into the Golden Land opened their gun ports one after another, then they all fired at once in a scattered mess of cannonballs.`
`The hundreds of explosive rounds they fired would negate the concept of any thing or person they touched, smash them into little bits, and set them ablaze with flames.`
`The battlefield full of writhing goats became a fiery hell.`
`A cannonball smashed the arbor.`
` The once‐beautiful garden maze was burned down piece by piece and the fleeing gold butterflies were drowned in flames, burning into nothingness like little scraps of paper.`
`This was no longer a battlefield where two sides fought for victory.`
`{n}It was just a confused, hellish pot.`
`The Golden Land...was being torn apart.`
`The once‐beautiful rose garden was filled with explosion craters, and its rose petals were scattered about without pity.`
`Flying bits of flesh, blood, fangs, jaws.`
` Shrieks and half‐crazed screams.`
`And even amidst this hellish swirl, the goats and the dead continued to fight.`
`As seen from atop the boats, ......this was, without a doubt, hell.`
`"All ships!!`
` Drop anchoooooooors!!"`
`When Erika yelled, the goats on the boats ran around frantically, and one by one, massive anchors hanging by chains were thrown from the ships' bows down into the earth below.`
`Those anchors smashed through not only the ground, but the bottom of the Golden Land itself, digging in with their wedge‐shaped tips.`
`"Erikaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`"Oh, {f:5:Beatrice}‐san!!`
` What a huge battle this is!`
` I was worried that I wouldn't be able to find you!"`
`{f:5:Beatrice} landed on the front tip of the warship, facing off against Erika, who stood on the bow.`
`"You will not be forgiven! I'll finish you myself right here!!!"`
`Beato jabbed with her pipe.`
`It transformed into a beautifully intricate, long, and golden sword.`
`"Very well, bring it on.`
` Let's settle this."`
`Erika threw her scythe up into the air.`
`When it returned to her hand, it had become a sword similar to Beato's.`
`The nearby goats crowded around Erika, trying to support her.`
`"Stay out of this.`
` Anyway, you all need to start lifting the anchors!`
` Tear up the Golden Land by its roots!!"`
`{i:Aye aye, sir!}`
` The goats saluted and rushed to their posts.`
`Several dozen ships had lowered their anchors, digging into the base of the Golden Land.`
`Soon, they were going to pull them up, ......and try to tear the Golden Land to pieces.`
`"Come, Erikaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!`
` I'll give you the honor of my final duel!!"`
`Beato raised her sword, bowed in the ancient fashion, and waited for her duel opponent.`
`Erika kicked off her shoes violently and slowly walked up to the tip of the boat barefoot.`
`Then, in accordance with Beato's rules, she bowed back.`
`A duel on the prow of a ship that pierced the sky.`
`Below, the crowd of goats was being blasted away by the indiscriminate cannonballs, burned up and crushed in the panorama of this world's end.`
`Even thinking about who among the Ushiromiya family was still all right......was now ridiculous.`
`Yes, it truly was the end of this world.`
` The end of the Golden Land.`
`Ground to dust, filled with flames.`
`The golden rose garden was burning spectacularly, the air filled with a shower of burning sparks and gold dust.`
`The ground, the base of the Golden Land, creaked as fissures ran through it.`
`All of the ships started pulling up their anchors at once.`
` Crowds of strong goats used all of their monstrous strength to lift them.`
`The anchors that dug into the Golden Land's base......spread cracks throughout the entire Golden Land.`
`Not just the ground, but the air itself was filled with cracks, and shards of gold fell down everywhere.`
`The Golden Land's end was adorned with the flames of hell and streaking gold fragments, with fiery red and ephemeral gold.`
`Atop the boat's prow, Beato and Erika looked down on this, their swords crossed and sparks flying between them.`
`"Now there's one hell of a sight to see!!`
` Don't you think it's fitting?!`
` The perfect final chapter for your tale...!!"`
`"The Golden Land may meet its end.`
` I may perish as well.`
` However, no one can erase the fact that we were here!!`
` Ange reached the answer!`
` The Witch of the Future has a mission and hope, and will soon go off on a new journey!!`
` We have already succeeded...!!"`
`"Too bad, Furudo Erikaaaa!!`
` This battle ends with our victory!!!"`
`A duel between the master of the illusion called the Golden Land and the witch who controlled truth.`
`The earth split behind them.`
` The Golden Land was torn up.`
`The cat box known as the Golden Land was ripped apart, and the nothingness below peeked out through the cracks.`
`The scrambling crowd of goats fell through the gaps and were swallowed by the sea of nothingness.`
`......Beato's friends were also among them.`
`They helped each other, stretched out hands to each other, intending to hold on to everyone to the very end.`
`......But that is such a fragile fantasy, and what romantic optimism it is to embrace it......at the end of the world.`
`The ground shattered and sank.`
` It fell apart into the ocean of nothingness.`
`None could survive.`
` None could be saved.`
`{n}This was...destruction.`
`As the friends fell into the sea of nothingness, they looked up one last time...and prayed.`
`They prayed that the master of the Golden Land would leave proof that the Golden Land had indeed existed.`
`However, Beato didn't look down at them.`
` They wouldn't have wanted her to.`
`"This is our Golden Land!!`
` I am the Endless and Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}, and I am here!!`
` Though we may fall, we will not suffer defeat!!`
` You will become living evidence!`
` I'll carve the proof of our existence into your chest!!"`
`"So long, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` This marks the end of your execrable endless game!!`
` Fall into the depths of hell, you illusion!!!!"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} and {f:5:Bernkastel}'s fight to the death had passed through its phase as a dynamic clash of fireworks, and was now a clash that was quiet and motionless.`
`......These two witches, who possessed power on an entirely different level, may have been truly equal in strength.`
`The battle could only be resolved by mutual consent, if one of them lost interest or found some reason for wanting to lose.`
`Since both were putting their all into the fight without yielding a bit, they were absolutely and completely equal......`
`"......{f:5:Lambdadelta}......`
` ......I'm glad...to have you as a friend..."`
`"Dammit, just a bit longer...!`
` Just fall apart already, stupid magic circle...!"`
`Battler got irritated and punched the magic circle, but there was nothing he could do except continue to watch over it.`
`After all, the only way to dissolve it was by waiting.`
`However, the pair of them still felt relief, if only a little.`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} really was strong.`
`{n}Even in a battle this spectacular, she fought on an even footing.`
`No, ......if you also took confidence into account, she seemed to have a slight advantage to Battler's eyes.`
`She would probably manage to buy them enough time.`
`{n}Ange would take the key and be able to return to the Golden Land.`
`They just had to endure a bit longer...`
`.........However, they had no way of knowing what {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s fate would be after this.`
`She had disobeyed the Senate, the highest‐level witches in existence.`
` ......A brutal fate probably awaited her.`
`However, even knowing this, Ange had to step forward into the future, without looking back.`
`......That was the single duty given to her, the Witch of the Future.`
`".........Onii‐chan, ......what's that...?`
` Something's coming towards us from a long way away."`
`"......?!`
` Crap, ......are they enemy reinforcements...?!"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} and {f:5:Bernkastel} were glaring at each other, so they didn't notice.`
`Heading towards them from the distance......were several emerald‐green glints.`
`That light showed that they were enemies.`
`"But there's only a few of them.`
` ......They won't be a match for {f:5:Lambdadelta}."`
`".............................."`
`All of the cats so far seemed like fish in a school,`
` giving the impression that they'd be terrifying as a group, but not much of a problem by themselves.`
`However, there was something different about the lights approaching them now.`
`.........They were approaching in a beautiful, ordered formation, like a constellation.`
`Battler quickly realized that this was something formidable......`
`".........My miko.`
` Isn't it about time to prepare the key...?"`
`Just by her tone, Battler was able to tell just how great a witch this was.`
`The black cats that surrounded her in a graceful and systematic constellation...`
`were all wearing large capes with elegant designs.`
`......It looked as though great overlords from many worlds had been transformed into cats, leaving only their capes untouched.`
`What Battler imagined was quite true.`
` That was exactly what had happened.`
`These were the overlords from many worlds that formed {f:5:Featherine}'s personal guard.`
`Their bodies took the form of cats merely as a sign of respect to their master, who took the form of a human.`
`These were entirely different from the pack of wild cats that served {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`"......Auaurora...`
` ......Oh, is it that time already...?"`
`"Keeping the guests waiting in anticipation is an important factor when holding a party.`
` ......It is, however, not something I am particularly fond of."`
`As she said this, her eyes flicked to {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
`The latter bowed hurriedly.`
`Though {f:5:Lambdadelta} grinned, she was also sweating with a brow furrowed with tension.`
`"............How long it has been, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}."`
`"A pleasure to see you...`
` Great Lady {f:5:Aurora}......"`
`"......This is no place to entertain one such as yourself.`
` ......Did you get lost on the way to the party...?`
` If so, allow me to guide you there myself."`
`"Th‐......that would be an honor, Great Lady {f:5:Aurora}......"`
`{f:5:Featherine Augustus Aurora}.`
` ......The legendary Great Witch.`
`It is said that she transgressed the limits of a witch, becoming a Creator,`
` .........and that, upon reaching this forbidden plane, she was cursed with a deadly ailment.`
`However, in life, she once turned her pet cat into a witch.`
`They say that this second witch wanders the sea of fragments endlessly, searching for any fragment capable of reviving her master from the pit of death called boredom, if even for a moment.`
`......And the cat did revive her master.`
`{n}Revived the sacred witch who had reached heights none should reach......`
`Just as witches look down from a higher world and sneer at {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, calling them pieces on a game board...`
`...so {i:she} looks down from a world higher still and sneers at the territories of witches, calling {i:them} pieces on a game board.`
`......If a witch's strength is measured by the height of the world they are capable of reaching...`
`...then she was like a witch come back from the realm of the gods, the one who had touched the highest, forbidden heights and survived.`
`Was there any chance of winning against her?`
`No.`
`Not only could {f:5:Lambdadelta} not choose to win, she couldn't choose to lose either.`
`"My miko.`
` Would you mind playing with your friend some other time, and getting back to work now?`
` .........Prepare the key."`
`".........Okay..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` The simple, naive way cats forget their errand partway through doing it is their true charm.`
` ......Don't you think so, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}......?"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} didn't say anything, but hung her head low.`
`......From this position, it seemed that the key's seal would dissolve at any second.`
`However, {f:5:Bernkastel} would probably find Battler and Ange before that.`
`Once those two got their hands on the key, they could leave this place immediately.`
` ......But that was only if {f:5:Bernkastel} and {f:5:Featherine} didn't find them first.`
`.........{f:5:Bernkastel}......couldn't be allowed to move from this spot.`
`"......Looks like that's game, Lambda."`
`".............................."`
`"I am the miko of the Great Witch {f:5:Aurora}, remember...?`
` You haven't forgotten that the Witch of Theatergoing bestows her protection upon her Reader mikos, have you......?"`
`Still keeping her head lowered, {f:5:Lambdadelta} gave no answer.`
`The Witch of Theatergoing gave protection to her Reader mikos.`
`If {f:5:Lambdadelta} attacked {f:5:Bernkastel}, who was a miko,`
` .........then the great {f:5:Aurora}, in accordance with her contract, would take that as an attack against herself, and "respond accordingly".`
`"......Let's make a deal."`
`"......For what...?"`
`"Where is Battler hiding?`
` If you come clean, we'll let all of this slide."`
`"Is the Witch of Miracles afraid of a tiny, little piece like Battler?"`
`"......It's because I {i:am} the Witch of Miracles.`
` ......I won't forget that even a little pebble like him is capable of creating one."`
`"It was a little pebble that got a big break as the Witch of Miracles, after all."`
`"I'll ask one more time. Where is Battler?"`
`"......................................."`
`"......Too bad, Lambda.`
` It looks like that's your answer."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} turned her back on {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
`Then, she told her master that she was leaving to prepare the key, ......and she started swimming towards the key room.`
`............If I let her go...any further, ............she'll find Battler and Ange......`
`Battler readied himself.`
` This time, it was his turn to become a sacrifice.........`
`Even though he was nothing more than a single pebble, ......he could still put out an eye.`
`A candy firework exploded right in front of {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`".........Lambda.`
` ......You really are a moron."`
`"L‐......{f:5:Lambdadelta}........."`
`"..................I've done it now......`
` ......Battler, Ange.`
` ......The rest is up to you...!"`
`The cat overlords changed their formation, becoming a ferocious constellation that surrounded {f:5:Featherine}.`
`Then, each drew the most terrifying of magic circles from their respective worlds...and began to chant.`
`".................................`
` ......I am slightly confused.`
` ......My miko, and you too, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` ......What sort of sideshow is this...?"`
`".........It looks like Lambda wants to stop me from going to get the key."`
`"Hoh.`
` ......And what would the point of that be, I wonder?"`
`"If you're having trouble understanding {i:that},`
` ......then you must be getting a bit tipsy, {f:5:Featherine}.`
` Looks like you need a pick‐me‐up."`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} acted as tough as she could.`
` Her fingertips were shaking slightly.`
`"............An attack against a miko is considered to be an attack against her master.`
` ......You should know this as well as anyone, correct...?"`
`"I know it.`
` ......That's the rule that says I'm gonna have to pick a fight with you guys."`
`"Hoh.`
` .........Have I or my miko caused insult to a miko of yours?`
` If so, then please accept my apologies."`
`"But will you not tell me?`
` I don't believe you have a miko at the moment.`
` ......How long have you had one?"`
`"As for that......`
` I've got a ton of them...!!`
` Thirty or forty, I think.`
` Maybe even more!"`
`"I, {f:5:Lambdadelta}, will handle any fight picked against one of my mikos, no matter who the opponent is...!!`
` All of them are certain that a happy ending will come!!`
` As the Witch of Certainty, I can't abandon people who put their faith in certainty and work hard to achieve their goals!!!"`
`".........Your tale would not be a disagreeable one.`
` It would be worthy of my viewing.`
` ......However, I am not a spectator at the moment, but a performer.`
` ......I know that you are my miko's close friend, so I will give you one warning.`
` .........Remove yourself from this stage.`
` I will prepare a special seat for you in my audience seating."`
`"............I've been thinking about which is more interesting—your tale, or the tale I've been watching."`
`"......And your conclusion?"`
`"Battler's tale is a hundred times better...!!`
` Sorry, but I'll be getting Best Supporting Actress this year!!`
` ......Hey, you guys!`
` You'd better vote for me in the last character popularity contest, okay?!`
` At least in the top 5! Got it?!"`
`"............Who are you talking to?"`
`As {f:5:Lambdadelta} pretended to joke around, ......she calmly glared at the one weak point.`
`If she had a chance for a single attack, .........then a one‐in‐a‐billion shot at victory existed.`
`That horseshoe‐shaped memory device floating around {f:5:Featherine}'s head.`
`{n}Without that, she couldn't preserve her own being.`
`Destroying it would be impossible,`
` ......but if {f:5:Lambdadelta} could just jar it a little, ......she might be able to make it bug out.`
`At least once in the past, {f:5:Featherine}'s memory device had been damaged, and her personality and appearance had changed.`
`......However, she was aware of that herself, ......and probably wouldn't let that happen again no matter what.`
`"......Very well, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` When you've finished your script, feel free to send it in whenever you wish."`
`"The script is simple.`
` ......Just one line.`
` "The fantastic, cute {f:5:Lambdadelta}‐sama...`
`took out the evil mastermind Auaurora in a single shot!""`
`"Foolish Lambda.`
` ......I never realized how stupid you were."`
`"......The cats need not interfere.`
` ......I will personally reward Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} for the courageous tale she has submitted.`
` ......You will be granted a fitting tale and a fitting ending for your bravery."`
`"{f:5:Featherine Augustus}......Auaurora{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aa!!!"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} summoned magical power from her whole body and raised it in a mass above her head.`
`"Forgive me, but—"`
`And then, the world's time stopped.`
`"Your script will not be used.`
` ......After all..."`
`Rather than time stopping, ......it was more like someone had stopped flipping the pages of a book.`
`In this motionless world, ......closely packed letters appeared.`
`"The one writing the rest of the script...will be me."`
`They were the tale that had been written up to this very moment.`
`{e:85:{f:0:"FEATHERINE AUGUSTUS......Auauroraa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa!!!"}}`
`{e:85:{f:0:LAMBDADELTA summoned magical power from her whole body and raised it in a mass above her head.}}`
`That was where the paragraph ended.`
`In this frozen world, {f:5:Featherine} sat with her arms crossed.`
`"......How troublesome.`
` ......It's been so long since I've written a fight scene.`
` ......After such a development, how vexing it is to be suddenly handed the pen......"`
`When I get stuck writing, I try to write in reverse.`
`In other words, instead of starting at the beginning, I start at the end and go backwards from there.`
`That way, it's easier to set up foreshadowing, and I can write the story with my vision for the end in mind.`
`......The only downside is that it is surprisingly difficult to write the climax without having set up the story first.`
`".........For lack of a better idea,`
` I'll start at the end of the fight and go back from there.`
` ......Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta},`
` having suffered defeat at my hands, you draw your last breath."`
`As {f:5:Featherine} said this, words were added to the massive group of letters that filled the frozen world.`
`However, she was starting from the end, so there was a large gap between the new words and the old ones.`
`"......So, what will your defeat look like?`
` ......You should probably have a heroic end to suit your bravery."`
`"......How about this?`
` You get blasted away by......something or other, slammed against a bookshelf,`
` your limbs snap off, and then, having perished, you fall into the darkness and disappear.`
` ......Yes.`
` Quite a flashy way to go.`
` ..........Good. For now, that's how your final moments will be."`
`The blanks were being filled up with the outline {f:5:Featherine} spoke of.`
`At the same time, {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s figure was wiped out.`
`After crossing her arms and thinking again, {f:5:Featherine} pointed in a suitable direction.`
`Spreadeagled against the bookshelf {f:5:Featherine} had pointed at, reappeared {f:5:Lambdadelta}, who had slammed into it after "something or other" blasted her there.`
`".........Well now, I must write up the fierce battle that leads to this end,`
` ......but as you correctly surmise, I'm a little tipsy at the moment.`
` ......I'll fill that part in later, when I have some time to go over it nice and slowly."`
`"......For now, let this be enough.`
` I promise to add in a heroic fight to your liking later on......"`
`{f:5:Featherine} snapped her fingers.`
`......{f:5:Lambdadelta}......had no idea what was going on.`
`Before she could even blink, ......she was suddenly here, slammed against a bookshelf.`
`"......W...h......a...t.........i...s......t...h...i...s............"`
`She couldn't comprehend {i:what} it was that {f:5:Featherine} had killed her with.`
`However, that was only natural.`
`After all, even {f:5:Featherine} herself hadn't decided.`
`However, {f:5:Lambdadelta} did understand one thing.`
`She was already dead.`
`Streams of blood dripped from the corners of her mouth.`
`Then, lines of blood appeared on her wrists and ankles, her elbows and knees.`
`She looked like a marionette doll of herself.`
`".........W...h......a...t.........{0}k...{0}i...{0}l......{0}l...{0}e...{0}d.........{nobr:m......e}......"`
`"Precisely, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` Let me know if you have any good ideas."`
`"......Y...o......u.........{0}m...{0}o...{0}n...{0}s...{0}t...{0}e......{0}r........."`
`Still pinned against the bookshelf, ......{f:5:Lambdadelta} let her head slump.`
`Her wrists, ankles, legs, arms, ......and neck.`
`Each of those broke off as separate parts, ......and the marionette shaped like her lost its strings, falling in pieces into the depths below.`
`Nothing remained.`
`It was all swallowed up by the darkness beneath them......`
`"A monster, she says.`
` ......Quite a compliment, for one such as I.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha."`
`"......L‐......{f:5:Lambdadelta}......"`
`"Ange, ......don't look. You can't look......!!"`
`Ange closed her eyes tight, shedding bitter tears.`
`She must not look.`
`The Witch of the Future......must not accept {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s defeat...`
`"She hasn't kicked it!`
` She was brave, and that's all there is to it...!!"`
`"I know...!!`
` That {f:5:Lambdadelta}......would never lose...!!"`
`Pop.`
`At that moment, there was a slight sound, ......and the golden key that hung in the air...shook.`
`......The seal on the key had finally broken.`
`Battler grabbed it immediately.`
`However, at exactly the same moment, a magical impulse shook the entire vast space of the key room.`
`"Wh‐what?!"`
`That impulse...seemed to have shaken something inside my pocket.`
`I stuck my hand in......and found that the fragment {f:5:Lambdadelta} had given us to return to the Golden Land......had shattered.`
`"......D‐dammit, ......Lambda's fragment...!"`
`"......You were so close too.`
` Now, there's nowhere to run."`
`"{f:5:Bernkastel}......"`
`"If Lambda had been a little cleverer, she probably could've bought you five more seconds.`
` ......Then, you would've taken that key and escaped to the Golden Land.`
` ......Looks like the miko suffers too when the master's a fool.`
` Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha."`
`"............Hoh."`
`{f:5:Featherine} quietly showed her surprise.`
`......To truly surprise her was no easy task.`
`The Witch of Miracles, who boasted that no one could even step on her shadow unless she wished it, ......fell.`
`After taking Battler's right fist to her face, she fell.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel}'s body immediately split into dust and reconstructed itself in front of Battler.`
` As though nothing had happened.`
`However, she was holding her cheek.`
`{n}She couldn't undo the fact that she had been hit.`
`For the first time in a hundred years, she had let someone tread on her shadow without wishing it.`
`Her expression gradually filled with shock.`
`And Battler's?`
`.........It couldn't be seen.`
`His outstretched right arm was blocking it, so his expression couldn't be seen......`
`"................................."`
`".........Wh‐.........what?"`
`"...............Take it back."`
`"T‐.........take what back.........?"`
`She didn't let the next strike hit her.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} vanished like mist, then reformed a short distance away.`
`However, Battler had only missed by a hair's breadth.`
`Not because she had intentionally made it so, ......but for real.`
`".........Ow... .........Ouch, ouch........."`
`Finally, she truly began to feel the pain of being punched in the face.`
`Too many years had caused her to forget the very concept of pain.`
`Very slowly, ......it was coming back to her.`
`"Ow! ......Owowow! ......Owwwww!!"`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} writhed in anguish, holding her cheek.`
`{n}The feeling forgotten for centuries seemed to be hitting home hard.`
`Battler looked at her.`
` Their eyes met.`
` ......Once again, {f:5:Bernkastel} remembered an emotion she had forgotten for hundreds of years.`
`".........Does it hurt?"`
`"...............!!!"`
`"The pain of your words ridiculing my friend.........is greater than that."`
`And then, a shudder.`
`What Battler saw before his eyes......was {f:5:Bernkastel} trembling with fear for the first time in centuries.`
`To {f:5:Bernkastel}, it didn't even look like Battler was rushing at her to deliver another punch.`
`It was as though......she was being sucked towards where he stood with his furious fist raised.`
`As her eyes opened wide in terror, ......Battler's massive fist filled her vision.`
`Of course, he wasn't capable of hitting her.`
` {f:5:Bernkastel} was just like a shadow.`
`It was true that trying to grasp her form was meaningless, akin to growing envious of the moon reflected on the water and trying to hit it with a stone.`
`You cannot smash the moon on the water's surface simply by throwing stones at it.`
`However, Battler threw. And threw.`
` Over and over.`
` Determined never to allow the moon to appear there again.`
`Fiercely thrown pebbles tore the water's surface.`
` They smashed the moon's reflection, splitting apart the water's surface itself, ......leaving even the bottom of the pond bare, ......breaking through everything.`
`And that certain and absolute willpower...broke through to a miracle.`
`A backwards kick that Battler shot out without even looking behind him...drove into empty space.`
`In that space......{f:5:Bernkastel} reappeared with a foot in her gut.`
`"Geh.........hagh....................."`
`"......Take back your ridicule of our brave friend."`
`"Uuh, ............ghh......ggggghh..........."`
`The Witch of Miracles fell.`
` For the second time, she fell.`
`Once would have been a miracle.`
` Things that happen more than once......aren't miracles anymore.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} understood.`
` Battler...had her fully grasped......`
`Then, she fell, ......slammed against the floor, .........struggled up onto her hands and knees, and vomited.`
`She threw up violently over and over.`
`{n}Her face was covered with pain and vomit and tears and snot.`
`Then, she looked up at Battler with a furious expression.........and howled.`
` And she wasn't howling at Battler.`
`"A‐Auaurora...!!`
` Y‐your miko is getting beaten up!`
` What are you standing around watching for?! Take him out!!!"`
`"Forgive me, but I am busy writing Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s final moments right now.`
` ......I cannot come to your aid.`
` ............Why don't you all give her a hand?"`
`{f:5:Featherine}'s guard, the cat overlords, now formed a different constellation.`
`Then, each drew a magic circle and began chanting.`
`"Ahah, ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!`
` You know what these are?! Each one of these cats is the final form of a main character, each from a game like yours!!`
` Every one acted the main part in their heroic tale, and the story of their bravery was given honor, allowing them to become {f:5:Aurora}'s guards!!`
` Each one fought for the very existence of their country, their planet, their universe!!"`
`"What about you?!`
` Ahhahaha, at best, you've just been playing around with your little sister and some imaginary witch!!`
` These main characters are on a totally different level from you!!`
` Eat this and die, take it to the gut, you pukespittle scum!!!"`
`"O‐..................Onii‐chan.........!!!"`
`The many spectacular magical spells displayed the beginning of a universe, the creation of planets, then their destruction and the universe's end, all in an instant.`
`After that, not a speck of dust should remain......`
`However,`
` when the smoke cleared, there was a person standing there.`
`It stood there...............its hands in its pockets......and its head hanging quietly.`
`Its face was in shadows and couldn't be seen.`
`"......Onii‐chan..............."`
`"What......the hell......?"`
`Battler...seemed to be completely uninjured.`
`Not only were his clothes not burnt, ......his hair hadn't even been disturbed.`
`"Wh‐......what the hell?!?!`
` Stupid cats, that didn't work at all!!"`
`The cat overlords silently shook their heads, sending a short report to their master.`
`"{ruby:Endless Nine:99.9999999}..."`
`"What......the...............?"`
`"It seems that no one can interfere with their tale.`
` Forgive me, my miko.`
` It seems the cats have reached their limit."`
`"......A‐and you call yourselves overlords of many worlds?!!`
` Didn't you all use to be main characters in some game board?!`
` And this is the best you can do?!`
` You're pathetic!!"`
`The cats knew.`
`They had known from the very beginning.`
`{n}If this man before them was the main character of this board, ......they wouldn't be able to interfere.`
`"......My miko.`
` Creating a tale on the game board is a privilege extended only to the Game Master.`
` ......Since that right has been asserted, I, being the mere writer that I am, must respect it.`
` I shall return to my position as a spectator."`
`"Y‐you useless master...!!!"`
`"...............Battler.`
` I apologize for the ridicule your friend suffered at the hands of my miko.`
` And I see that the right to weave your game belongs to you, the Game Master.`
` You will weave your own game.`
` That is as it should be."`
`"......................................."`
`"However, my miko is also a Game Master in your game at the moment.`
` ......It seems the two of you opened the game board at the same time.`
` It is rare to have two Masters for a single game, but this miracle pleases me.`
` ......After all, I can rest assured that this will make for a proper final game for you both."`
`".........Stand up,`
` {f:5:Bernkastel}."`
`"............I see...`
` ......So, you're saying that if two Game Masters are going to fight, ......they should do it by the rules of the game...`
` .........*giggle*, ......*giggle*giggle*.`
` ......Why didn't you just say that in the first place......?"`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} slowly got to her feet and made her body melt away like mist.`
`Then, she appeared in the air once again, facing Battler.`
`"Very well.`
` ......I'll fight by the rules of your game board.`
` However, I'm not as patient as you all are, so I'll start with a short‐tempered, overwhelming puzzle and end this in an instant.`
` Who will be my opponent?`
` I don't mind if you both take me on at once."`
`"Onii‐chan, I'll fight too."`
`"............Stay back."`
`"Why...?!"`
`"Watch from there.`
` And this time, ......understand what I wanted to teach you."`
`".........Onii‐chan......"`
`"How's that?! {f:5:Aurora}!"`
`"......I will be your witness.`
` If you defeat my miko, I promise to return you all to the Golden Land."`
`"*giggle*giggle*.`
` Assuming the Golden Land still exists, that is."`
`"I.........believe in everyone."`
`"That's right...`
` Beato...and everyone else......won't lose...!"`
`"*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*...!!!`
` In that case, it's better that we start with the bad news.`
` .........Erika, you can make your report now.`
` Come!"`
`When {f:5:Bernkastel} snapped her fingers, Erika appeared with a bow.`
`"Pardon me for the interruption, my master."`
`"......Sorry, Erika.`
` I shouldn't have kept you waiting when you came bearing good news."`
`"No problem!`
` Rejoice, my master.`
` I have come to report the complete destruction of the Golden Land!"`
`"......Liar!!"`
`"The Golden Land has been totally destroyed.`
` I'm here to report that it has collapsed and fallen into the sea of nothingness.`
` Not just the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, but the fantasy creatures as well have been completely annihilated."`
`"Liar!!`
` I won't believe it!"`
`"......Then allow me to convince you.`
` Take this, my master."`
`Erika humbly presented an object wrapped in cloth.`
`It shone with a golden light.`
`"......What's this?`
` A golden apple?"`
`"This is the heart of {f:5:Beatrice}, master of the Golden Land...!"`
`"B‐......Beato.........!!"`
`".............................."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} grabbed hold of it, held it aloft, and gazed at it.`
`"......Even like this, it's still beating.`
` ......You're so cute, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......The game board that you are might be opened again by someone.`
` ......You still believe that, don't you......?"`
`"I‐it's okay, Onii‐chan...`
` We didn't see Beato get defeated...!`
` This is some sort of tactic they're using on us.`
` A tactic to make us lose our morale...!`
` Or maybe it's a tactic of Beato's!`
` She changed herself to pretend that she's been defeated.`
` There's no way that {f:5:Beatrice}...that everyone...that the Golden Land......could be destroyed......!!"`
`"*giggle*.`
` .........*giggle*giggle*giggle*, ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha!!`
` True, if the Witch of the Future believes that, she might be able to make it so...`
` .........So, let me show you.`
` Watch closely, Witch of the Future from 1998."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel}......threw the golden heart into the air like an apple.`
`Then, with the blood‐red blade of a scythe that appeared in her hand, ......she split it......`
`"{p:1:{f:5:Beatrice} died in October of 1986.`
` Therefore, the Golden Land she created was completely destroyed.`
` Your relatives, kept alive in the Golden Land, were destroyed along with it.`
` Your father, mother, and of course Battler...will never return to you again, and will never speak your name again}."`
`".....................Ah......"`
`"A Witch of the Future has the power to interpret things how she pleases and rewrite what happened.`
` ......However, there is just one fact that she can't overwrite, no matter how much she struggles."`
`"......And that is...death.`
` You cannot overturn any notion of death, be it physical or mental.`
` ......It is the single blade of truth with which witches of the past can strike down witches of the future......"`
`".........Ah, ...............ah, ......ah............"`
`"Hang in there, Ange."`
`"............But, ............but..............."`
`"You decided to accept it, didn't you?`
` ......You decided to live on, even if no one came back alive, ......didn't you......?"`
`"......I know...... ......I know, but... ............I know, but...!!!"`
`Even so, ......a tiny sliver of hope......had remained inside Ange's heart.`
`A hope that despite everything, just maybe,`
` ......if I was blessed with a miracle,`
` .........someone......would come home after all.`
`It wouldn't matter when.`
` It could be ten years later or fifty years later.`
`{n}It wouldn't even matter if they didn't recognize my face......`
`I believed that someone might come back someday......`
` ......And I had decided to live with that tiny hope in my chest.`
`......Even though I had accepted everyone's death for a time, ......even though I had seen it in the Book of the Single Truth,`
` even so, ......I thought.........what's the harm.........in believing in a miracle.........just a little.........?`
`A miracle that you believe in when you know it won't happen.........is hope.`
`And so, the witch who presided over the fact that miracles don't happen.........had ruthlessly torn that hope away.`
`"Don't cry."`
`"I know...!!`
` But, ......but!!"`
`"Even the big brother you're crying to right now......is already dead."`
`"Onii‐chan isn't dead, he's here!!`
` Right here!!!"`
`"Don't cry, Ange."`
`"But, ......but!!!"`
`"Don't cry!!!"`
`At Battler's shout, Ange bit back her tears.`
`"If it's like that, ......then so what?`
` .........What do we of the past mean to you living in the future?`
` .........Ange.`
` What witch were you, again?"`
`".........Huh?"`
`"Whether we're alive or dead means nothing to you."`
`"Th‐that's not true...`
` I want you to be alive...!"`
`"That's not what I mean!!`
` You can cross over life and death, remember?!!"`
`Ange didn't understand what he was telling her.`
`So, stunned into silence, she frantically considered what her brother was trying to tell her.`
`Battler slowly lifted his face......and stared at {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`"............And you...aren't a witch.`
` .........You're a reaper."`
`"That's right.`
` I have the sickle that reaps all hope and miracles.`
` So I must be what you say."`
`"......You're a reaper...who stole away the hope that kept Ange alive...`
`......and lured her towards death."`
`The one who teased Ange with truths of the past, stealing the future from her eyes and making her look only at what was already behind her.`
` And the one...who thrust the hope‐crushing Single Truth in front of her, gently pushing her from behind as she, of her own accord, took that step from the skyscraper's roof off into a world of nothingness.`
`"Now, I'll free Ange from the curse that you are!!`
` No more will her old curses hold her prisoner!!`
` Ange will step forward into the future!!`
` But not into the emptiness of the abyss that you're trying to lure her into.`
` ......She'll step into the future beyond 1998, a place where she will live strongly!!"`
`"{y:0:Human}{n:0:Human}s are wretched creatures, who walk into the future while staring back at the past!!`
` That's why they fail to notice even the most obvious pitfalls, and plummet headfirst into them like comical fools!!"`
`"Come, {f:5:Bernkastel}!!!`
` A witch of the past like you can't block the radiance of the future!!"`
`"Aha, ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!!`
` Then I'll get started, by the rules of your game!!`
` I'll give you some locked‐room riddles.`
` But since I'm short‐tempered, overpowering, and easily bored, I'll give you all of them at once!!!"`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} spread her hands, and it seemed as though a halo or angel wings were spreading out behind her.`
`Each of the countless rays that spread out from her......was the blue‐trailing blade of a locked‐room mystery.`
`They were the countless, endless number of locked‐room mysteries that {f:5:Bernkastel} had amassed, the souvenirs she had brought back from the many places she had visited during her long travels through the sea of fragments.`
`All of those rays twisted at once...and aimed towards Battler.`
`It was as though infinite giant snakes had turned their heads to stare at him.`
`".........If you fail to shoot down even a single puzzle,`
` then this is goodbye.`
` I'm not as patient as Beato, who gave you until October 5th at midnight to give your answer.`
` If you don't answer immediately, you die."`
`In that case, this wasn't "mystery" anymore.`
`{n}This wasn't an intellectual game, but a merciless assault.`
`"Die."`
`"............!!!"`
`All at once, hundreds of guided lasers known as mysteries shot at Battler.`
`The complex geometric figure drawn by those blue lasers was nothing but divinely beautiful.`
`Each one was a mystery.`
` Trying to solve each one in this oppressive hailstorm would be like threading a storm of approaching needles.`
`Battler flew freely through this vast space, dodging the beautiful blue streaks of mystery as he shot them down one after another.`
`The entirety of the mystery knowledge he had built up to this day told him the answer to each puzzle.`
`Each time his eyes glowed with the answer, one of the mysteries shattered.`
`However, that mystery was only one out of hundreds.`
` This hardly rose to the level of "opposition" or "resistance".`
`".........Onii‐chan, it's impossible...!!`
` Run!!"`
`"There is no unsolvable mystery, ......just like there is no inescapable fate."`
`"Onii‐chan...!!"`
`"Watch, Ange.`
` Don't miss what I'm trying to show you..."`
`By now, the bundle of mysteries looked like one giant snake with blue streaming behind it.`
`Battler skillfully dodged it, precisely splitting its many fangs off one by one.`
`Even though he knew it was a useless resistance, like trying to pick up all the grains of sand on a beach one by one.`
`"Not bad.`
` .........Are classic mysteries your specialty?`
` Then what about twists on the genre?`
` Let's see if you can handle more and more mysteries from all times and places."`
`Even though Battler was still fighting the giant snake, wings appeared behind Bern once more.`
`And......they gave birth to seven more huge snakes.`
`It now looked like a great dragon with seven heads.`
`"Ushiromiya Battler.`
` It's true that you're a very avid reader and an expert on the mystery genre.`
` But you're still young.`
` ......There's a limit to how many books and mysteries you could've read.`
` ......Learn that this world is filled with countless riddles and tricks that you've never heard of."`
`"......Onii‐chan!!`
` This isn't possible anymore!!!`
` Please, just run away!!`
` You can't beat {f:5:Bernkastel}!!"`
`Battler's expression remained calm.`
` However, his whole body was covered with sweat, and he was breathing hard.`
`It was clear that he couldn't overcome this onslaught, though he himself refused to admit it.`
`Battler wiped away his sweat......and fixed his gaze on the eight snake heads that surrounded him in three dimensions...`
`"......Ange.`
` .........You believed in the miracle that someone from your family might still be alive,`
` and after living that way for twelve years, ......you lost heart.`
` You gave in and succumbed to the miracle that refused to happen."`
`"..................That's......"`
`"In that case,`
` ......if I'm going to be seeing you off as you try and step forward into the future,`
` ......I can't afford to give in to another miracle."`
`"That's right.`
` But I'll still harvest your miracles and hopes.`
` All of them, without mercy."`
`What was now an eight‐headed dragon......opened its eight jaws.`
`It looked for weak points from all angles, hoping to swallow Battler in a single gulp.`
`He wouldn't be able to dodge any longer.`
`"Ange‐san.`
` ......If you're expecting a miracle, then I have some bad news for you."`
`".........?!"`
`"Beato has now been completely destroyed, and that has even been announced in red.`
` Do you know what that means?"`
`"..........................."`
`"Since Beato has been destroyed, the Golden Land has been destroyed also.`
` ......That means that every last one of them has vanished.`
` In other words, you no longer have any friends who can conveniently show up and save you from this pinch."`
`Beato had been destroyed, and that had been confirmed in red.`
` ......Therefore, no one else would come to rescue them.`
`......Even {f:5:Eva} was a resident of the Golden Land.`
`After helpfully breaking the key's seal ahead of their arrival, she had probably hidden away somewhere.`
`However, now that Beato had been destroyed, ......all of the residents of the Golden Land had met the same fate as ice under the sun...`
`Any faint hopes that {f:5:Eva} was hiding in the shadows, ready to save them from this final pinch...`
`had been completely crushed from the moment that {f:5:Bernkastel} had smashed the golden heart......`
`No longer was there anyone who could save them.`
`There was no hope at all of her brother being saved by any factor not already present.`
`What about herself?`
`...I'm just standing here watching.`
`If I help, will I be able to bring about some kind of miracle...?`
`But I don't know that much about the mystery genre.`
`I only have the most superficial knowledge of how to fight, gleaned from watching Beato's game fragments.`
`I'll have my work cut out just trying not to slow him down, ......so there's no way I'll be able to protect him.`
`But......I can't just watch...`
`"O‐...Onii‐chan...!!`
` Let me fight too...!!"`
`"Stay back!`
` .........Just......keep watching.`
` ......And think."`
`"Think about what......?!!"`
`"Go back to how you felt at the very beginning......back when you were six years old.........when it all started."`
`"......How I felt......when I was six........."`
`"You've lived the last twelve years looking for the truth.`
` .........But that wasn't your real, greatest wish, was it?"`
`"......My......greatest wish........."`
`"We prepared this final game......because we wanted to protect that wish and that hope.`
` But, unfortunately, you wasted it."`
`"......So you'll have to abandon that hope as you step forward into the future.`
` .........But even so,`
` even so, ......if you have strength in your heart, ......you can have it."`
`"......Have what.........?"`
`"Remember.`
` Your very first wish.`
` ............Even after learning the Single Truth, remember."`
`The Single Truth.`
`Even after learning the heartless truth, that everyone is dead and that no one will come home, ......remember.`
`Remember......your very first wish.`
`"Onii‐chan!!!"`
`There was a cataclysmic flash, as brilliant as the birth of a sun.`
`The snakes, glowing pale blue, ......ran through Battler all at once.`
`Battler was stained red, surrounded with a cloud of blood.`
`Then, he stumbled, ............and looked at Ange one final time.`
`Ange...couldn't say anything in response.`
`The light in Battler's eyes faded, .........and, slowly, ......his body began to fall......`
`It reached the ground......and landed gently, like something settling on the ocean floor.`
`Ange rushed toward him......and looked at the final face of her dead brother.`
`His eyes were opened wide, ......filled with an unwavering determination to the very last second...`
`".........Remind me, was Ange‐san particularly good at mysteries?"`
`"She's nothing compared to Battler."`
`The waving snakes raised their heads......and surrounded Ange.`
`Ange...had no blades to fight with.`
`She could only cling to her brother's dead face, saying his name over and over.`
`"This is a surprisingly boring ending.`
` ............I guess this is checkmate."`
`"................................."`
`The eight snake heads.........all attacked at once.`
`Ange held her brother's face, ......thinking about his final words......`
`My very first wish......... That could only be one thing...`
`That everyone.........would come back......`
`That fueled my life for twelve years, until I was so exhausted that I abandoned my own hope.`
`Then, in exchange for the hope I'd abandoned, I searched for the truth.`
`And at the end of the truth, ......I was confronted with something brutal and ruthless that I had no need to know,`
` ......and as a result, I was faced with the true despair of knowing that no one would come home.`
`The final hope, ......which I had abandoned but hadn't been able to let go of completely, was crushed.`
`The Single Truth.`
`If only I hadn't learned it, ......I might still have been able to keep hold of that faint hope.`
`But, ............now............`
`{a:c:You can still have it.}`
`{a:c:If you have strength in your heart,`
` you can still have it.}`
`{a:c:Remember...your very first wish.}`
`"..................Gahah, ......gahhk!"`
`Battler was coughing.`
`Impossible.`
`His whole body had been pierced, and he had been completely dead.`
`{n}For him to cough would be too much of a miracle to be possible.`
`"What?!!`
` Why?!`
` Battler died!!`
` So why, ......why was he revived?!"`
`Battler rose to his feet slowly.`
`Though blood still dribbled from his mouth, his expression was fearless.`
`However, Ange didn't stand up.`
`She kept sitting, her head lowered.`
`".........Well, that was a nice warm‐up.`
` ......Shall we get started, {f:5:Bernkastel}?!`
` Round two...!!"`
`"Wh‐what in the...... Why, my master?!`
` The dead can't revive!!"`
`"Impossible!!`
` ......{p:1:Battler is dead}!!!`
` How can he revive?!"`
`".........Onii‐chan.........is alive........."`
`"{p:1:I've used the red truth!!`
` I've said that Battler is dead}, right?!`
` So how, {i:how} can he come back to life?!?!"`
`"Even if the whole world says he's dead,`
` .........I'll be the one person in the world who believes.`
` ......Onii‐chan is alive.`
` And, someday, ......he'll come back to me."`
`"That's right.`
` ......As long as you don't lose that hope, ......there's no miracle that can be crushed!"`
`"H‐......how dare you stand before the Witch of Miracles, ......and speak of miracles yourse{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}elf!!`
` Uuu{0}u{0}ur{0}r{0}r{0}r{0}rg{0}g{0}g{0}g{0}g{0}g{0}g{0}gh{0}ghh, swallow them, grind them up,`

` You can't erase us.}`
`"Even if the whole world refuses to acknowledge it, the miracle will happen as long as we believe!!"{n}{t}"Even if the whole world refuses to acknowledge it, the miracle will happen as long as we believe!!"`
`The eight wriggling snake heads transformed into a massive whale jaw......and swallowed everything.`
`"There will be no miracle!!`
` {p:1:There exists no one whom you can trust}!!`
` So dii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}ie!!!"`
`{a:c:`
`"There is someone.`
` ......Everyone...will protect me."}`
`The cruel whale of mystery that tried to swallow everything......was gouged deeply by a massive wedge.`
`That deeply pounded wedge could only have been used by someone who had both talent and a deep love for mysteries.`
`"You call that cliché a triiiick...?!!`
` I've read and gotten bored of that one long ago!"`
`The woman who stood back to back with Battler, launching stakes, ......was very, very clearly......`
`"Beato?!?!`
` How?!`
` {p:1:I announced your death with the red truth}!!"`
`".........So what if you did......?"`
`"{p:1:The red truth is absolute!!`
` A perfect truth, which no one can overturn no matter how hard they try}!!"`
`"Even if the whole world gets together......`
`...and denies that my family is still alive,`
` .........even if that's forced in front of my eyes as the Single Truth,`
` ......I won't acknowledge it.`
` After all..."`
`Ange slowly rose to her feet.`
`Around her, ......the shapes of people slowly appeared, and they also rose to their feet.`
`One after another, a whole crowd of them.`
`They were......Ange's family, her relatives.`
` Everyone from Rokkenjima.`
`That wasn't all.`
` Everyone from the Golden Land, all of the fantasy creatures appeared, and following Ange's lead, they rose to their feet.`
`Then, all of them glared at {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`"Even if the whole world denies my hope, I won't abandon it.`
` I won't abandon my unshakable hope that everyone's alive.`
` ......And now, I've finally gotten there.`
` .........This is it. My attitude as a witch."`
`".........Y‐you...... Weren't you just a Witch of the Future...?`
` Just a powerless witch who could only shed tears of regret for the past...?!"`
`"I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}.`
` ......My titles are the Golden, the Endless,`
` .........and the Witch of Resurrection."`
`".........You've reached it, haven't you, Ange?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Thanks, Onee‐chan.`
` ......After all those long years, I'm there at last."`
`"I always knew you could get there."`
`"Thanks, Onii‐chan.`
` ......I understand it now.`
` What your last game was trying to teach me."`
`"Disappear, putrid delusions!!!`
` I can't...`
` I can't accept something like thi{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}is!!!"`
`"Everyone will be with me for eternity.`
` No matter how many times people try to kill them with the red truth,`
` ......I'll reject it.`
` Everyone will come back to me, again and again.`
` .........I am {f:5:Ange}, Witch of Resurrection!!`
` In my world, your red truth can't touch me!!!"`
`"Uuurrrggggaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ag{0}g{0}ghhh!!!"`
`From Ange.........no, from Ange and her family and her friends, several golden streaks shot out at once.`
`They were the same as the marks left by {f:5:Bernkastel}'s great snakes.`
`However, the glow inside these...was gold.`
`Then, they wriggled, combined into one single mass, and transformed into an eagle with two wings.`
`It wasn't one‐winged anymore.`
`Thanks to Ange's absolute willpower, the golden eagle had gained the wing it needed to fly into the future.`
`Those spread wings............made {f:5:Bernkastel} and the whale shrink back.`
`"The Ushiromiya eagle never looks back."`
`"And it never gives up...!!"`
`The golden eagle easily swallowed the blue whale with its wings, grinding it to bits.`
`And it didn't let the whale's master escape either.`
`It was now {f:5:Bernkastel}'s turn to run.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} didn't fight the golden eagle.`
` She couldn't.`
`In this world of Ange's, where even the red truth couldn't hurt anyone, just what sort of attack could have any effect?`
`She frantically ran this way and that, throwing one wedge of red truth after another at the Ushiromiya family.`
`{a:c:`
`{p:1:Ushiromiya Kinzo is dead}.`
`{p:1:Ushiromiya Krauss is dead}.`
`{p:1:Ushiromiya Natsuhi is dead}.}`
`She repeated this over and over again, ......but no one fell down.`
`Ange wouldn't accept it, so they couldn't pierce anyone.`
`"Th‐......this is......`
` Can Endless Nine really do this...?!`
` E‐even the red truth......doesn't work?!!`
` Just what is this golden truth?!!`
` What kind of truth can defeat red truth......?!!!"`
`"A believing heart.`
` ......This is {i:our} consensus.`
` ......Compared to the truth that we all acknowledge and share, your red truth can't hurt anything."`
`".........So long, {f:5:Bernkastel}!`
` ......This time, it's really checkmate."`
`"I, ......I............won't accept this,`
` I woo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}on't!!!"`
`The massive golden eagle......finally swallowed {f:5:Bernkastel} whole.`
`It then slammed into the vast ceiling......and there was an incredible explosion accompanied by an earthquake.`
`From the cracked ceiling, along with many falling chips, ......a single black cat plummeted...and slammed against the floor.`
`Erika ran up to it, repeatedly calling out to her master, hugging it.`
`Then, she realized that it was still breathing, and simultaneous expressions of relief and shock rose to her face.`
`"......Don't worry.`
` I won't let you lay a finger on my truth, and in the same way, I won't lay a finger on your truth either."`
`"...She looks like a wet mop."`
`"Call it a free scolding for her own good."`
`"Beato.`
` Don't act too cozy with my big brother.`
` I still haven't accepted your relationship, got it?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` It was your own foolishness to revive me!`
` It's too late. My charming subordinates and I will be tormenting you until the day you die!!`
` And I'll make you watch Battler flirt with me every day!!`
` Wah?!"`
`"Wow, this is pretty convenient.`
` Looks like this resurrection magic has an off switch."`
`"Wha— ......Wai— .........An— ............!!"`
`Beato kept appearing and disappearing like a lightbulb turning on and off.`
` Ange seemed to be enjoying herself.`
`"Waaaaaaah, Battleeeeeeeer, Ange's being mean!"`
`"Go easy on her, Ange."`
`"Sure.`
` If you say so, Onii‐chan."`
`"Ange, you're incredible!! Uryuu!!"`
`"Ange‐sama!!`
` Congratulations on becoming a Witch of Resurrection!!`
` This way, we'll all...be with you forever!"`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` Everyone.`
` ......The anti‐magic toxin doesn't matter one bit.`
` You'll be with me for all eternity."`
`"Nice, Ange.`
` Well said!!"`
`Everyone surged forward, squishing Ange.`
`They tried tossing her into the air, but dropped her onto her butt, and everyone laughed.`
`Ange looked a bit resentful, but when her brother lent her a hand, she got up and joined the circle of smiles......`
`A quiet applause greeted them.`
`{f:5:Featherine}, their witness, had acknowledged their victory and was clapping for them.`
`"......Splendidly done,`
` Lady {f:5:Ange Beatrice}.`
` ......In celebration of this miracle, I bestow upon you the title of Lady.`
` The tale you weaved was quite entertaining."`
`"................................."`
`"There is no need to be so hostile.`
` I am congratulating you."`
`{f:5:Featherine} smiled serenely.`
`Then, the cat overlords broke their positions in their constellation and lined up behind her.`
`It was clear that this was not only a peaceful action, but part of a solemn ceremony.`
`"You have defeated my miko.`
` And I thank you for sparing her life.`
` .........As you can see, she is my cute pet cat, which I keep to stave off boredom.`
` If she died, boredom would overcome me as well."`
`The true strength of this being, who referred to {f:5:Bernkastel} as a pet cat, had already been made clear during her fight with {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
`Even so, Ange spoke.`
`"......I......won't forgive you for killing {f:5:Lambdadelta}."`
`"My, that doesn't sound like the words of a Witch of Resurrection.`
` Can you not revive her whenever you wish?"`
`"Huh?`
` I can revive her...?!"`
`"It's okay!`
` I'm sure that Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} has been revived somewhere, thanks to your power. There is no need to worry."`
`"Indeed.`
` She has already been moved to the audience seating I prepared for her.`
` Do not fear.`
` She is receiving the red‐carpet treatment."`
`"Really?!`
` That's......wonderful......"`
`Ange finally relaxed and let the tension leave her whole body.`
`"Well now.`
` ......Battler.`
` You are now the sole Game Master of your final game."`
`".........True.`
` That cat of yours will probably retire after that."`
`"Perhaps you should carry on with the final ceremony of your game...`
` ......My miko is as forgetful as a cat, but she can sometimes be as persistent as one.`
` I suggest getting it over with quickly."`
`".........Yeah.`
` ......I'll take that suggestion."`
`"I shall be your witness and write a detailed account."`
`"The final...ceremony......`
` .........So, even this game...is about to end."`
`Battler nodded silently.`
`Then, he stepped out of the crowd and motioned for Ange to follow him.`
`As Ange passed by each member of the Ushiromiya family, they cheered her on, giving words of encouragement.`
`Battler took out the golden key and handed it to Ange.`
`It now had the same glint it had possessed when he had first given it to her.`
`Then, two doors appeared out of thin air on either side of them.`
`They had a stately design, ......making it clear that this was a very important decision.`
`"......Am I supposed to pick one without any hints?"`
`"Of course not.`
` I'll give you a hint.`
` By now, it should be an easy puzzle.`
` A simple puzzle with two answers.`
` And you'll choose your answer by opening one of the doors."`
`"I see......`
` Okay.`
` So this is a continuation of that Halloween party.`
` I fell asleep during that party, didn't I?`
` I'm glad to finally wrap that up properly."`
`"Beato.`
` Come forward."`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` This is your fault for falling asleep before my puzzle.`
` I'm glad I've gotten a chance to tell it."`
`"Sorry about that.`
` It sounds like it'll be pretty tough."`
`"Uryuu!`
` You'll be fine, Ange!"`
`"Kihihihihihi, I wonder about that."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Prepare yourself. It's a tough one!"`
`"......Calm down, Ange.`
` It's an easy puzzle.`
` ............Do you remember what your brother told you at the very beginning, ...about how to choose the best possible option...?"`
`"................................."`
`"Battler, you're giving too many hints.`
` This is the triumphant return of Lady {f:5:Ange}, Witch of the Future.`
` All you have to do is watch over her."`
`"......True.`
` Then I'll hand it over to Beato.`
` ......I'm counting on you."`
`"Indeed.`
` .........Then let us begin."`
`"O‐......okay."`
`Ange gulped, then stared up at the witch's face.`
`The witch held out her {p:42:left hand}, bringing it close to Ange's face.`
`{n}Then, she slowly spread her fingers.`
`"Look carefully at my palm.`
` I'm not hiding anything, correct?"`
`"......Yeah.`
` There's nothing there."`
`"Watch closely.`
` I'll make a fist,`
` ......and then stretch out my index finger."`
`She stretched out her index finger and held it right in front of Ange's eyes.`
`"Watch the tip of my finger closely.`
` Ready? It'll be fast."`
`The witch rapidly lifted her index finger high into the air, pointing at the heavens.`
`Just as Ange looked up to see the finger raised high, it swung down as though trying to dodge her gaze.`
`In that manner, the finger swung...`
`up,`
` down,`
` left,`
` right,`
` then left again, as though Ange was playing a game of Acchi Muite Hoi.`
`Feeling as though she'd lose if she couldn't keep up with the fingertip, Ange swung her face this way and that, looking serious.`
`The witch's hand moved faster and faster.`
` Ange didn't lose track of it.`
`Then, the witch's high pointing finger took a sudden swing downwards,`
` ......and when it stopped, her index finger was curled up, and her hand was held in a simple fist.`
`"..........................."`
`"Ready?`
` I'm going to open my hand..."`
`The witch slowly opened her {p:42:right fist}......`
`And there.........was a cutely wrapped candy.`
`"Ready for the question?"`
`"Yeah."`
`"Was this a trick or magic?`
` That is my puzzle for you."`
`"Go ahead, Ange.`
` ......Give your answer.`
` Is this a trick or magic......?"`
`I...know.`
`I know what the answer is.`
`"If your answer is "magic", open this door.`
` If it's "a trick", then open that door."`
`I had already decided my answer.`
`"This is my answer."`
`I walked over to the door that represented the answer I had chosen.`
`Then, I put the golden key into the keyhole, ......and turned to face everyone.`
`"The Ushiromiya Eagle never looks back."`
`"......That's right.`
` Sorry."`
`I gripped the key tightly and twisted.`
`Then, the key and the door flashed brilliantly......and slowly faded away.`
`Beyond the door...was a strangely colored space.`
`{n}If I step into this, .........I'll reach the future I chose.`
`Before taking that single step, ......I spoke without turning back.`
`"The Ushiromiya eagle never turns back.`
` ......So I won't turn around, but I'll say this!`
` Thank you, everyone.`
` But this isn't goodbye!`
` I'll always be with you all!!"`
`"Yeah.`
` You won't turn back.`
` But we'll always be standing behind you."`
`"......That's not it!!`
` Despite it all, I still believe.`
` I'm positive......that everyone will come back!!"`
`".........Ange......"`
`"That is good.`
` ......Ange.`
` I look forward to the day when we all meet again."`
`"Ange, my adorable granddaughter.`
` We may be away for some time.`
` ......Here, don't forget this.`
` It's your prize from that quiz party."`

`"......This was lying next to me when I woke up on the sofa, wasn't it?`
` ......This was...my prize."`
`"Take it back to the future with you, and treasure it."`
`"Thanks, ......everyone."`
`"......Maybe I should've taken this a bit more seriously."`
`I...took a step forward.`
`Forward...into the future.`
`{a:c:I won't say goodbye.`
`{n}So, see you later.`
`{n}We'll always be together.}`
`The wind brushed against my cheek.`
`{n}I slowly opened my shut eyes.`
`......I might have had my eyes closed for a very long time.`
`{n}Even the sparkles below me...seemed blindingly bright.`
`.........It was a strange world, with a sea of light beneath me.`
`The wind was cold.`
` ......However, it told me that I had returned to reality.`
`I was standing with one foot outstretched.........over the sea of light below me.`
`How long have I been here?`
`......Since the moment I was lured by {f:5:Bernkastel}, just about to take a step off the edge,`
` ......time has probably been stopped for me.`
`"...................................."`
`I slowly.........pulled my foot back in.`
`{n}Then, I leaned against the fence and sat down.`
`The sky...was far away.`
` But so was the ground.`
`This whole time, I've been in this sad place, so far from both of those worlds.`
`I can't...go to the sky.`
`In that case, I have to return to my world.`
`"And the elevator is probably the way to go.`
` ......I've had enough skydiving.`
` I really doubt it'll happen again.`
` There won't be any more miraculous survivals if I jump down from here."`
`After all, some Witch of Miracles has already guaranteed that a miracle like that definitely isn't happening.`
`Then, I finally noticed them.`
`The guards that President Okonogi had assigned to me.`
`They were approaching the fence with forced smiles and sweat dripping down their faces, trying not to startle me.`
`That's right.`
` I got away from these guys before jumping off, didn't I?`
`".........Did you think I was going to jump?"`
`"W‐well, you did look......uh........."`
`"......Sorry.`
` If I jumped, I guess you'd really catch it from Okonogi‐san."`
`"Ange‐san, ......it's dangerous there.`
` For now, please come back to this side..."`
`"Let me stay here just a little longer.`
` .........It's okay.`
` I won't get any sudden ideas.`
` Does one of you have a cell phone?"`
`"Y‐yes......"`
`"I want to talk to Okonogi‐san about something.`
` Would you mind calling him?"`
`The guards looked at each other, then rushed to take out their cell phones.`
`They looked like they didn't want to put me in a bad mood in case I jumped off and left them to take the blame.`
`"Th‐......the president has picked up...`
` .........Here......"`
`"Thanks.`
` ......Hello, Okonogi‐san?`
` ............Yeah.`
` Sorry for calling all of a sudden.`
` No, it's excellent news.`
` A bit of an early Christmas present.`
` ......I'm giving all of the Ushiromiya Group to you.`
` .........That's right.`
` In exchange, I have a few things I want."`
`As she gazed down at the sea of stars spread out on the ground below her, Ange spoke.`
`She spoke of how she would live from now on.`
`.........Ushiromiya Ange's...`
`strange and mysterious adventure......ends here.`
`But {i:my} life will continue.`
`After all, I now have a job to do.`
`I am {f:5:Ange Beatrice}, witch of Mariage Sorcière.`
`"Ushiromiya Ange just fell from here and died.`
` ......I am {f:5:Ange}, the witch.`
` ......I'll live.`
` As a witch."`
`"And so, your game ends."`
`As Ange opened the door and vanished from sight, ......the residents of the Golden Land disappeared as well.`
`Afterwards, only Battler could still be seen.`
`He had now finished doing everything he could for Ange......`
`"......Close the door.`
` ......I believe there was some rule about closing this door?"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` ......The rule said that you needed two people to close it."`
`"Hey, Auntie {f:5:Eva}."`
`"Don't call me that, it makes me feel old!"`
`The two of them stood to the left and right of the door that Ange had vanished through.`
`"Ange.`
` ......Let there be happiness in your future."`
`"After all, we'll always be with you."`
`Then, the two of them held their hands out in front of them.`
`As they did, a door popped into existence and closed.`
`{n}Then, the door itself faded away......`
`"......And now, we have completed our role."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......This marks the end of the pieces' purpose."`
`"You have worked hard, both of you.`
` ......And with this, we shall clean up your game board."`
`Slowly......the world began to crumble.`
`At a glance, it looked as though the City of Books was starting to fall apart.`
`But that wasn't it.`
`Battler and {f:5:Eva}'s world...was being cut off from the City of Books.`
`The world broke apart bit by bit, and the ceiling would probably fall in soon.`
`"This is goodbye,`
` Battler‐kun."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......See you later. And count on it.`
` Take care of Ange, Auntie Eva."`
`"At least at the end, try calling me {f:5:Eva} onee‐san, will you?"`
`"................................."`
`"See you later, Erika.`
` Somewhere, someday."`
`"............Both Ange and I were Witches of Truth.`
` ......So...just what was the difference between the two of us?"`
`"..................I wonder."`
`"I was...a witch who suffered through the truth.`
` ...However, I turned my back from that truth.`
` ......She, on the other hand, was a witch who—even after learning the truth—continued to believe in her own truth.`
` .........If she was the real Witch of Truth,`
` .........then what kind of witch was I?"`
`"If you ask me,`
` ............you...aren't a witch."`
`"..........................."`
`"After all, you're the detective."`
`"........................`
` .........<Good>.`
` ...I'd forgotten."`
`"We'll meet again, someday.`
` ......Wherever there's a crime, the detective's sure to be there, right?"`
`"Yes.`
` When another crime occurs in the Ushiromiya family,`
` I promise to appear."`
`"So long, great detective."`
`"So long, my rival.`
` I look forward to the day when the two of us can cross blades again."`
`Those...were the final words the two spoke to each other.`
`A mighty roar and a cloud of dust blew by, covering everything.`
`......And then, everything vanished.`
`{n}Nothing remained.`
`{n}Battler and {f:5:Eva} were both gone.`
`The City of Books was shrouded in silence.`
`".........It's all...over."`
`"Yes,`
` Great Lady {f:5:Aurora}."`
`"......You will take care of my pet cat.`
` .........Now, I shall go too.`
` There are some things that must be cleaned up in this world as well."`
`When Hachijo made her announcement,`
` everyone fell silent, thinking they had misheard her.`
`Before too long though, the crowd exploded with a shower of questions about what she meant by this.`
`"Th‐that's...too cruel...!!"`
`"You can't do this after dragging us along this far!!"`
`"Madam Hachijo, we have come from far and wide to see it!`
` How can you......do this now?!!"`
`".........I will say it again.`
` I've changed my mind.`
` Ushiromiya Eva's diary will not be made public."`
`"A, a scam, this is all a scam...!!"`
`"Is that really Ushiromiya Eva's diary you're holding?`
` I say you cooked the whole thing up!"`
`"You think you can get away with something like this?!!`
` Show us the book!!!"`
`"Children of man can be so hideous.`
` ......Neither you nor I have the right to read what lies in there.`
` ......However, now that I think of it, this has been quite an entertaining show.`
` I was fortunate enough to witness an amusing side of children of man tonight, as they disturbed the sleep of the dead and promulgated rumors with abandon.`
` .........Let us go, Bern.`
` I have had my share of entertainment for the night..."`
`A black cat jumped onto Hachijo's shoulder,`
` and she disappeared off to the side of the stage, the Book of the Single Truth in her arms.`
`Only the angry yells of the massive crowd remained......`
`And so, .........the people gradually lost interest in Ushiromiya Eva's diary,`
` ......some even doubting whether it had ever existed at all.`
`Though the weekly magazines were in an uproar over Hachijo Tohya's apparently fraudulent claims,`
` there were some who began to voice an opinion that the Rokkenjima mystery itself was an indiscreet desecration of the dead.`
`It wasn't likely that Rokkenjima could rest in peace just because of something like this.`
`However, people became slightly more hesitant to show open interest in the Rokkenjima mystery in public.`
`An unopened cat box is eternal.`
`And so, Rokkenjima will probably never find peace.`
`However, .........even so, compared to how it was before, .........life will surely be easier.`
`.........Because, as the years pass, ......the dust will slowly pile up on it where it lies in the depths of oblivion.`
`At the bottom of the deep sea known as the depths of oblivion, ......the witches' cat box will probably get slowly buried as the years pass.`
`{f:5:Featherine}...threw a single golden rose into that sea.`
`{n}An offering to let the cat box rest in peace.`
`Let us mark the end of this long story......with the tale of that golden rose.`
`In the darkness, there was a massive roar and an earthquake.`
`When it passed, ........dawn began to rise over the endless night......`
`"Where am I............?"`
`"We're in the wreckage of an old submarine base.`
` Do you remember...?"`
`"It's where it all started."`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` The place where we first met, two generations ago."`
`"Hahaha.`
` Sounds pretty romantic if you put it that way."`
`Battler and Beato......could be seen in the ruins of Rokkenjima's underground submarine base.`
`The cave's mouth opened to the sea, and the gentle sound of the waves drifted in along with the cries of the seagulls.`
`It seemed that the typhoon, which had closed off the island for two days, ...had finally gotten bored and gone away.`
`Beato went down to the shore and lifted up a large sheet.`
`{n}Beneath it...was a motorboat.`
`Of course, it wasn't from the time of the war.`
` It was modern.`
`"Pile this up on the boat.`
` It's heavy."`
`"Whoa.`
` This is a gold ingot.`
` I thought they all got buried."`
`"I thought something like this might happen,`
` so I snuck this one out beforehand."`
`The single heavy gold ingot was dropped into the boat.`
`{n}I'm not sure how much this is worth by itself, but it must be quite a lot.`
`"Have you ever driven a motorboat before?"`
`"You're joking, right?"`
`"It's easy.`
` I'll teach you."`
`She wasn't used to this, but after several mistakes, Beato finally got the engine started.`
`"If you go out that way and hop from island to island, you'll see Niijima before too long.`
` Then, you can just land on a sandy beach."`
`"......Aren't you coming?"`
`"I cannot.`
` ......I am the master of the Golden Land.`
` I cannot leave this place."`
`"What's to be gained from staying?"`
`"What's to be gained from going?"`
`"Let's live."`
`".........I cannot.`
` I have already committed countless sins in countless worlds.`
` The number of lives I have taken, sins I have committed......is too great."`
`"But you haven't committed any sins in our world."`
`"No, .........that is not true."`
`"................................."`
`"Go.`
` Go while I'm still in a good mood.`
` Otherwise, I may seal the island in a storm again."`
`Battler suddenly spun around.`
`When Beato turned around to see what was going on, her body was suddenly lifted into the air.`
`"Then,`
` I'll take you back as a souvenir of the Golden Land."`
`"L‐let go...!`
` Th‐this isn't safe...!!"`
`"Enough screaming.`
` Listen carefully, {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"Wh‐what...?"`
`"I'm going to steal you away."`
`"........................Ba......"`
`As Battler quietly gazed at her with serious eyes, Beato was lost for words.`
`"If you have sinned,`
` then it's my sin as well for making you do it.`
` ......So, let's carry your cross together."`
`".........Battler............"`
`"As long as I live,`
` ......I'll carry your cross.`
` .........Let's leave the Golden Land.`
` You and me, together."`
`Beato was now too shocked to say anything at all.`
`Then, tears poured from her eyes, and she covered her face with both hands.`
`Battler gently set her down on the boat.`
`He undid the mooring ropes.`
`......Now there was no longer anything tying this boat to the island.`
`"Let's go."`
`Controlling the boat as Beato had taught him, Battler slowly guided it out......`
`When they passed out of the dimly lit cavern, they were immediately struck by the bright rays of the sun and surrounded by a crowd of white seagulls.`
`As the seagulls flew this way and that, ......the feathers they dropped in the water seemed to celebrate the boat's departure.`
`The brilliant sunlight told them that they were now free of the island's curse.`
`......The sky, now freed from the seal of the typhoon, seemed too bright to be real.`
`Feeling hot, Battler took off his jacket.`
` .....It was swept away by the wind and danced through the sky.`
`However, instead of panicking, Battler just smiled as he watched it go.`
`Beato also watched it go.`
` ......No, she watched the island go.`
`Rokkenjima, ......and the Golden Land she had spent a thousand years in.`
`"Will I.........be able to live......?"`
`"You will.`
` ......You won't have a magical butler, but there's lots of conveniences out there in the world.`
` ......There are all kinds of things you can't find on Rokkenjima.`
` I'll...show you this world of ours."`
`".........Will I......be able to live......?"`
`Beato repeated the same words again.`
`{n}Battler knew what she meant.`
`However, no matter what answer he gave, he wouldn't be able to resolve her problem now.`
`......However, there was a way to resolve it.`
`Time...and heart.`
`{n}Little by little, bit by bit.`
`Like a chain being cut by falling drops of water, ......he would have to sever the curse of the island gradually, ......over a long period of time.`
`It might take a long, long time.`
`{n}However, someday, ......she will be free.`
`That's what I believe.`
`"I am the sinful witch, who toyed with hundreds of deaths on that island.`
` ......Your world...is too brilliant for me."`
`"No, you have to live."`
`I answered immediately and forcefully.`
`"If you think you need to atone for hundreds of sins, then keep on living and living.`
` Live as hard as you can, ......with everything you've got.`
` That's the only way you can atone."`
`"............Is that...truly the only way to atone for my sins?"`
`"That's right.`
` And you'll definitely be able to do it someday.`
` Trust me."`
`"........................Battler........."`
`"Come on, don't look at me with teary eyes.`
` It's embarrassing..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*......`
` Forgive me.`
` Then, at the very least,`
` ......would you close your eyes?"`
`"Wh‐......why should I... Hey, your face is pretty close......"`
`"Foolish man......`
` You ought to be cursed for taking the witch away from the Golden Land.`
` .........That's why you must close your eyes.`
` ......I‐...it's.........embarrassing for me too."`
`As soon as Battler shut his eyes......`
`{n}...soft lips......covered his.`
`Then, they slowly drew back.`
`He tried to open his eyes, but received a quick slap on the cheek.`
`"Don't look, I told you not to look at my face!!"`
`"C‐come on, what's there to lose...?!"`
`"You have no delicacy!`
` Don't open them, not yet!!`
` Why?`
` B‐because I want to kiss you again...!!"`
`The next kiss......was on his earlobe.`
`"H‐hey, quit it...!`
` Now this is getting really embarrassing...!"`
`He knew he'd get hit again if he opened his eyes, so he resisted with his eyes still shut.`
`Beato tickled his ear by softly blowing on it,`
` and then she spoke in her usual cheerful, bullying voice.`
`"Sorry, Battler.`
` I'm a terrible, atrocious witch."`
`"Yeah, I know.`
` You're an evil, cruel witch."`
`"And so, I cannot atone for my sins.`
` I'm the sort of witch who can cackle over hundreds of deaths...!"`
`"Ah, come on...`
` But it's just like you to say that."`
`He accidentally opened his eyes.`
`......And when he did......the witch was nowhere to be seen.`
`The Golden Witch had vanished......like a dream or an illusion.`
`......And...so had the single ingot they had carried with them.`
`A black luxury car was parked at the rear entrance of the skyscraper.`
`Men wearing suits were packing a heavy‐looking attaché case into its trunk.`
`"Let me handle all the rest.`
` We'll take care all of the troublesome work."`
`"I'm counting on you.`
` I'm sure Aunt Eva would be glad to entrust it to you,`
` the person she trusted most."`
`Out of the building...came Ange and President Okonogi.`
`Ange's expression......was peaceful.`
`It was hard to imagine that this was the same person who had always looked so dark to Okonogi.`
`"......In her later years, the company president was very ill.`
` She might have said some fairly harsh things to you,`
` ......but I don't believe that was how she truly felt."`
`"I know.`
` On my bad days, even I say things I shouldn't."`
`"...............You've changed."`
`"You think so?"`
`"......I thought you would never forgive the president as long as you lived."`
`"You're the one who taught me, Okonogi‐san."`
`"I did?`
` Did I say something?"`
`"Without love, the truth cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}."`
`"Did I say something that pretentious?`
` Heh{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha."`
`"It's been a long journey.`
` ......It really has been a long journey, all just to understand what you told me that day."`
`Of course, Okonogi understood.`
`He understood that she had taken a long and arduous journey through her own heart.`
`"Once you've decided on your new address and bank account, get in touch.`
` I won't let you want for anything."`
`"Any problems with the Sumadera family?"`
`"Leave that to me.`
` We have your power of attorney as our rallying point.`
` Thanks to that, the Ushiromiya Group has a united front.`
` ......Because of what you did, Ange‐chan, the business built by the former president has been protected.`
` I truly believe she would be joyful at your decision."`
`"I'm just making you deal with all the hard stuff."`
`The Ushiromiya Group was shaken by the passing of their great president, Ushiromiya Eva.`
`Since there was no clear successor, the group had been in danger of splitting.`
`Amidst this, Ange, who had inherited a large portion of the group's stock, was closely watched to see how she would act.`
`......However, since Ange had shown no interest in any of this, and had gone around talking about things like selling all their assets and donating everything to some charity,`
` the group had grown very shaky indeed.`
`There was even a chance that an outsider, such as the Sumadera family, would step in and destroy the Ushiromiya Group.`
`As disturbing as it may seem,`
` it's a fact that some even wished for the center of all this trouble, Ange, to disappear...`
`......However, because Ange had a change of heart and decided to help do what was best for the Ushiromiya Group that Eva had brought together,`
` the worst‐case scenario had been avoided.`
`Okonogi had been named as Ange's successor.`
`Now that he had Ange's trust, there was no more reliable ally to be had.`
`Okonogi himself had certain plans he could carry out based on the knowledge that Ange trusted him.`
`Okonogi, who had carried great responsibility in the Ushiromiya Group thanks to his position as Eva's closest confidant, was the most natural choice to be Eva's successor,`
` and thanks in part to his ability, everything had now been wrapped up smoothly.`
`This way, the Ushiromiya Group was secure.`
`By now, the Ushiromiya Group was the only thing other than Ange herself to hold the Ushiromiya name,`
` so she might have thought of it as her last tie to her family.`
`"You know, you're free to come back any time you want.`
` We'll have a chair set aside just for you."`
`"Thanks.`
` Just knowing I have a place to go back to, I can set off on my journey in peace."`
`"What are you going to do from now on?"`
`"I'm going to become an author."`
`"An author?`
` To write novels?"`
`"It doesn't matter what.`
` It could be novels or picture books.`
` If I have any skill at drawing, maybe I'll do a manga.`
` ......What I do doesn't matter.`
` As long as I can share my heart with someone."`
`"......Sounds like you've set a noble task for yourself.`
` I'll be praying for your success."`
`"Thanks.`
` If I manage to publish a book, I'll send you a copy."`
`"I look forward to it."`
`The car's trunk was closed with a clunk.`
`{n}Apparently, all of her luggage had been loaded.`
`"Ah, yes, allow me to introduce you to the driver.`
` He's a protégé of mine.`
` He is trustworthy, and you can rely on him for anything.`
` Oh, and he worked as a guard for the old president for many years, so you might recognize him."`
`"......As long as it isn't Amakusa."`
`Achoo!`
` The man walking out of the driver's seat sneezed.`
`"Now that hurts, missy."`
`"Hey, Amakusa, just what have you done to her?"`
`"......Well, he was always the most flippant of Aunt Eva's guards.`
` I was hoping for pretty much anyone else."`
`"But he was also the one closest to you, wasn't he?"`
`"......At least listening to him talk can be pretty entertaining."`
`"The boss assigned me to be his contact with you.`
` If you ever get into any sort of trouble, just let me know."`
`"Can I send you to go buy toilet paper?"`
`"I'll even buy you some feminine hygiene products to go with it."`
`"......See?`
` The guy's a creep."`
`Okonogi guffawed.`
` I got into the back seat.`
`"Stay well,`
` Ange‐chan."`
`"I guess this is the last time anyone will call me by that name."`
`"Let me know when you've decided on a new one."`
`Okonogi patted the roof of the car.`
`At that signal, Amakusa honked the horn and removed the hand brake...`
`"So, until you've decided on a new name, I guess I'll be calling you missy."`
`"That's fine for now."`
`"......Okay.`
` Where are we going?`
` North? South?"`
`"............Any recommendations?"`
`"How about leaving the main island entirely?`
` I'd suggest north to Hokkaido.`
` ......Huge meadows, giant clouds!`
` A novelist writing stories in a log cabin... Sounds awesome."`
`"South it is.`
` ......I'd already decided to do the opposite of whatever you said."`
`"Heheh, that's pretty harsh."`
`"I'd like to go someplace warm.`
` A town with a view of the sea."`
`Ange slowly closed her eyes.`
`{n}Things had been pretty crazy lately, and she was tired......`
`"Roger that.`
` Next time you open your eyes, you'll be in an unfamiliar land.`
` ......But it'll be a warm town with a view of the sea."`
`"Can't wait to see...`
`what you choose."`
`The car got onto the freeway.`
`{n}It was surrounded by the great river of cars heading east and west.`
`By now, no one could tell which of those points was the car she rode in.`
`Starting today, Ushiromiya Ange would change her name and live in a new climate.`
`Changing her name didn't mean that she had given up on being Ange.`
`This was Ange's...`
`{n}...no, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}'s mission.`
`{a:c:`
` I am {f:5:Ange Beatrice}.}`
`{a:c:`
` The Golden and Endless Witch of Resurrection.`
` A witch of Mariage Sorcière.}`
`{a:c:`
` The final witch, who is still alive in the future called 1998.........}`
`A strong wind blew through my hair.`
`My nose was filled with the smell of the sea.`
`......I must have been standing still for a very long time.`
`This is.........a point cutting through the sea.`
`I was standing on the bow of a boat.`
` I was still holding that thing.`
`"......Missy.`
` If you stand around there too long, you'll freeze."`
`"Amakusa.........`
` ......So, this is......"`
`Captain Kawabata's face peered out at her.`
`"You can see it now.`
` That's the old Ushiromiya family dock."`
`"Whoo.`
` Not even a trace of it left."`
`".........I see.`
` ......I've come back here.`
` It's been a really long daydream.........no, a long and windy side trip."`
`No matter what sort of tales are woven and written about the past,`
` ......they have nothing to do with my tale of the future.`
`I swore to live life looking only to the future, without turning back.`
`If that vow I made to myself has any meaning, then this hasn't all been just a daydream.`
`And besides, I've brought many things back with me from that long side trip.`
`Among those, there are even some things that are immediately useful.`
`"...........................`
` ......But yeah, this isn't going to be useful for anything."`
`I threw the scrubbing brush into the ocean.`
`I threw the can of mackerel into the ocean.`
`I threw the memory foam pillow with the One‐winged Crest into the ocean.`
`I threw the old‐type white school swimsuit into the ocean.`
`I threw the fully ripe mango into the ocean.`
`I threw the decorative pine branch into the ocean.`
`I threw the uniform from Angel Mort into the ocean.`
`I threw the signed celebrity photograph of Kinzo into the ocean.`
`I threw the bag that laughs with Kinzo's voice into the ocean.`
`I threw the One‐winged Eagle carp streamer into the ocean.`
`I threw the bouquet of golden roses into the ocean.`
`I threw the music box that had been passed down through the generations into the ocean.`
`I threw the mass‐produced Sakutarou doll into the ocean.`
`I threw the tea set bearing the family crest into the ocean.`
`I threw the pocket watch bearing the family crest into the ocean.`
`I threw the {f:5:Beatrice} corsage into the ocean.`
`I threw the Battler doll into the ocean.`
`I threw the {f:5:Beatrice} doll into the ocean.`
`"......What was that?"`
`"My attachment to the past.`
` .........I was...shedding my old shell."`
`"Turning over a new leaf before stepping onto good old Rokkenjima?"`
`"......Not exactly.`
` I've quit being a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} called Ushiromiya Ange."`
`"Hm?"`
`I won't waste that long journey.`
` I now have a new way to live.`
`And that isn't as the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} called Ushiromiya Ange.`
`I am......reborn.`
`"Captain,`
` sorry, but would you mind leaving for a second?"`
`"Hmm?`
` Sure, whatever you say."`
`Captain Kawabata buried his face in the driver's seat.`
`"......What is it, missy?`
` Why the troubled face?"`
`"I feel like taking a step into a new life."`
`"You already have."`
`"True.`
` ......If I could sell off all the Ushiromiya family wealth that's burdening me, maybe donating it to some charity, that would be a huge relief.`
` Then, I'd finally be able to escape from the shell called Ushiromiya Ange."`
`"...........................`
` ......It seems a waste of all that money. You could do anything you wanted with it."`
`"Who cares?`
` My point is that I don't need it."`
`".........That may be true.`
` ......Then again, not everything that you'd be selling off belongs to you exclusively.`
` ......For example..."`
`"Are you talking about the Ushiromiya Group stock?"`
`".........That's right.`
` They may be little more than scraps of paper to you,`
` but doing something like that could shatter the whole company...`
` I don't think my boss could bear to have that happen."`
`"Yeah, I know.`
` It's like that for the Sumaderas and President Okonogi alike.`
` There are plenty of people who're in a tough spot because I can do as I please."`
`"............There's no doubt that you're a VIP, Ange‐san.`
` Instead of doing something dramatic, wouldn't it be better to keep your head down at this point...?"`
`"What would be the fastest and most convenient way to prevent this VIP from doing as she pleases, I wonder?"`
`"......Hmm, what would be the best way...?!`
` Well, we could break out the drinks, hash things out, and..."`
`"Anyone could guess that the final destination of my journey is Rokkenjima.`
` And, right now, Rokkenjima is completely uninhabited.`
` ......There's no one there.`
` No one to see or to hear.`
` Today is perfect weather for a locked room."`
`".........Well, that may be true."`
`"The Sumadera family is following me.`
` They even managed to barge into President Okonogi's building with perfect timing.`
` ......Someone leaked the fact that I was there."`
`"Are you saying my boss sold you out?`
` ......Then why would he give you a bodyguard?"`
`"Since he has no idea what I might decide to do at any given moment,`
` President Okonogi wants to have both me {i:and} the Sumadera family indebted to him.`
` And if he sells information about me, lets me escape by a hair, and keeps track of my whereabouts, he can have both me and the Sumadera family in his debt while keeping a trump card in his hand."`
`"You're definitely over‐thinking things there......"`
`Amakusa wore a forced smile, trying to smooth things over.`
`"The Sumadera family is absolutely following me.`
` My actions are being intentionally leaked to them.`
` We will bump into each other on Rokkenjima.`
` I will be killed by them.`
` After that, you will kill the Sumadera hitmen,`
` and President Okonogi will have a trump card to use in negotiations with the Sumaderas."`
`"......If I die, the Ushiromiya Group will be stable for the time being.`
` Plus, they'll be able to give a warning to the Sumadera family.`
` On the other side, the Sumadera family itself will be able to neatly do away with Aunt Kasumi, the leader of their overenthusiastic radical faction.`
` ......Both sides will finish their bargaining with a draw, and everyone'll be happy."`
`"........................Whew.`
` ......That's a pretty interesting story you've thought up there."`
`"The golf bag you brought with you.`
` I've had a look at what's inside.`
` I'm impressed... You could start a war or something with all those guns.`
` ......But one of them was a sniper rifle.`
` Would a bodyguard who's always by my side really need something like that?"`
`"Well, you never know what might happen......"`
`"Why would a bodyguard, who works best when traveling light,`
` choose to abandon his position for a whole day to get a gun like that, and right before we leave for Rokkenjima?"`
`".........Missy,`
` ......you're over‐thinking this, okay......?"`
`"When I reach Rokkenjima,`
` ......you'll suggest that I go visit the place they died or something, getting me alone.`
` That's the bait.`
` The bait to lure in Sumadera Kasumi and the others waiting for me on Rokkenjima.`
` After that, you'll use that ridiculously huge gun to end them all like fish in a barrel."`
`"......Well, what's wrong with being efficient?`
` Isn't that what a guard's supposed to do?"`
`"In addition to a cutting‐edge sniper rifle, you also had a modern German submachine gun."`
`"Those are really handy.`
` No matter how many people the Sumaderas have, I could take them all out, no trouble..."`
`"There was one more.`
` A handgun.`
` ......Even though the sniper rifle and the submachine gun were the best and the newest models, the handgun alone is beat up and old‐fashioned.`
` See?"`
`Ange......pulled the handgun out and pointed it at Amakusa.`
`"C‐......cut it out.`
` This isn't funny......"`
`"A handgun is something you're always supposed to have on your person, right?`
` So, why would you go get a second handgun, and go to the trouble of getting an unusually old one?`
` There's a theory that explains this.`
` ......That is...that it's the same kind of gun Sumadera Kasumi and the others are using."`
`"This is a Tokarev.`
` A gun once used by the Soviet military, which has gotten pretty popular in the Japanese underground.`
` A very likely weapon for the Sumaderas to be using."`
`"......Also, having Sumadera Kasumi die would be convenient for the Sumadera family as well.`
` They could have leaked......no, exchanged information from their side as well.`
` That would make it possible for you to know in advance that the Sumadera hitmen will be using Tokarevs."`
`Amakusa was speechless.`
`Was he speechless because this was all true, or because he was stunned by the determination with which Ange pointed that gun at him?`
`"The plan that you—`
`no, the plan that all of you made together...`
` It was to use me as bait to lure Sumadera Kasumi to an uninhabited island, then manipulate the scene so that it looks as though both sides finished each other off.`
` That way, everything would be settled nice and neat for both President Okonogi and the Sumadera family."`
`"......................................."`
`A single line of cold sweat dripped down Amakusa's forehead...`
`With the wind whipping through her hair, Ange spoke coldly.`
`"......All it takes is the presence of this handgun,`
` and a deduction like this becomes trivial for Ushiromiya Ange.`
` Your thoughts, ladies and gentlemen...?"`
`"............You haven't taken the safety off."`
`"I know.`
` ......Tokarevs don't have a safety."`
`Amakusa tried to dive behind cover, but he couldn't outrun a bullet.`
`It shot into his gut, making him double over in pain.`
`Knowing that he had a gun hidden in his pocket, Ange nipped any possibility of a counterattack in the bud.`
`Blood spurted from Amakusa's forehead. He did not close his eyes again.`
`".........The perfect, easiest way to confirm a death, without even being a doctor."`
`"Y‐.........you............!"`
`Kawabata showed up, all color drained from his face after having noticed the gruesome scene on the deck.`
`This time, it was his forehead at which Ange pointed the barrel of the gun.`
`"You needed time to get the boat ready.`
` That's what you told me.`
` However, if you've been bought, then we can say for sure that you were buying time so that Sumadera Kasumi could set up her ambush on Rokkenjima."`
`".........I, I have no......no idea what you're talking about...!!"`
`"You're a cat box, inside of which is a Kawabata who was bought and betrayed me, and a Kawabata who hasn't betrayed me.`
` ......Now then, how can I kill the part that betrayed me?"`
`"S‐stop...!!`
` Don't shoot......!!"`
`"I just have to shoot the whole cat box to death."`
`The boat's owner slumped over backwards......and fell.`
`Then, with a second bullet, Ange performed a perfect examination.`
`She had......survived.`
`She had now surely escaped......the expertly woven plot to kill her.`
`......Ange returned to the bow of the boat, faced the strong winds head on, and peered into the future in front of her.`
`The boat whose owner was gone...headed towards the endless horizon, on and on in a straight line.`
`She prayed that the truth she truly desired to reach lay before her.`
`Then, ......she heard the sound of clapping.`
`{n}The sound of clapping, on a boat where Amakusa and the captain were no more.`
`However, Ange didn't look surprised.`
`{n}She calmly and slowly turned around.`
`"Splendid reasoning, comrade Ange.`
` My fellow Witch of Truth, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}."`
`"......Oh, you're here, Erika."`
`"Anytime there's someone who wants to expose the truth, I am there.`
` *giggle*giggle*."`
`"Hey, Erika."`
`"What...?"`
`The boat had already passed by Rokkenjima.`
`{n}The island's silhouette was now off in the distance.`
`The boat headed towards the endless horizon, ......continuing on its endless journey.`
`The new Witch of Truth announced the beginning of this endless journey to her fellow witch.`
`".........I'll carve out my future in my own way."`
`"Sounds splendid."`
`"At the end, ......will there be a truth for me to find?"`
`"After all this, just what sort of truth are you looking for?"`
`"......................................."`
`"................................."`
`".........Hmph.`
` ......You're right.`
` I know that the truth isn't worth anything.`
` And there's one more thing I've figured out."`
`"What's that?"`
`"That bewildered look on Amakusa's face when his scheme was exposed.`
` That was pretty good."`
`"*giggle*!"`
`""<Good>!""`
