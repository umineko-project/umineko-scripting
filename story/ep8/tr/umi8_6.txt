`"The day after Christmas isn't Christmas.`
` It couldn't happen."`
`"Heheheh.`
` Too bad. Wrong."`
`"Huh? Why...?!"`
`"Ange‐chan, what time of day does a new day start?"`
`"Midnight, 0:00."`
`"There you go.`
` At midnight, isn't it night outside?"`
`"......Ah!"`
`I see.`
` The first night was just after midnight on December 25th.`
`In other words, the time right after the previous day ended and Christmas began.`
`That would indeed be Christmas Day, and it would be at night.`
`"And then, the morning of the 25th would come, and when the sun sank again, that would be nighttime on the 25th again......"`
`"Exactly!`
` You figured it out."`
`"Hohoho!`
` If only you had figured it out a little faster."`
`Grandfather laughed like Santa Claus.`
`Auntie Eva asked him to count it as a right answer, since I figured it out in the end, but Grandfather shook his head.`
`"Come on...!`
` Don't be such a stingy Grandpa."`
`"Still, now I've figured out how to do it.`
` I'll get the next one right."`
`"Yes, yes.`
` That's the spirit.`
` That's my granddaughter for you."`
`"Thank you, Grandpa!`
` I'm really ready now.`
` I'll start getting a lot of them right!"`
`"Yes.`
` Give it your all.`
` I have a truly splendid present waiting for you."`
`After bowing to Grandfather, I hurried off with Auntie Eva to where everyone else was gathered.`
`"Oh, I see.`
` It is possible...!"`
`"Yep, that's right.`
` After all, there are two nights in every day."`
`"Right!`
` December 25th starts at 0:00 midnight.`
` Midnight is during the night, so that's the first night.`
` Then, morning comes, and when night falls again, it's still the same day until midnight!"`
`"Exactly.`
` And both of those nights are nights on Christmas Day."`
`"Eheheheheh.`
` Am I awesome? Am I awesome...?!"`
`With a delighted smile, Auntie Eva patted my head vigorously.`
`"Wahahaha!`
` Well done, Ange.`
` I tried to make it a hard question, but you solved it like it was nothing."`
`"Congratulations, Ange‐sama.`
` ......Here is a medal for getting the first question right."`
`Genji‐san held out a gold‐colored medal.`
`{n}Grandfather smiled at me, urging me to take it.`
`"Th‐thank you!"`
`"Keep up the pace.`
` Well now, that is all for my puzzle.`
` Head over there and ask whomever you choose for a quiz."`
`It was a heavy, gold‐colored medal.`
`If I get a lot of these right, my pocket might burst.`
`I'm gonna get so many that I can brag about it to everyone!`
`After bowing to Grandfather,`
` I hurried off with Auntie Eva to where everyone else was gathered.`
`As Ange ran off,`
` Kinzo watched her go with a warm gaze.`
`"Did I make it a bit too easy...?"`
`"No.`
` I think it was just right."`
`"............Genji.`
` Have I...managed to act the part of a good grandpa...?"`
`"Of course."`
`"Ange is young.`
` And, she frequently grows sick and is unable to come to Rokkenjima.`
` ......She probably won't...remember me well."`
`Young children have their own kind of cruelty.`
`They think of kindness as something they will naturally receive.`
`And because they think of kindness as only natural, ......they forget about it quickly.`
`".........It is no different from gratitude to one's parents.`
` It will probably take Ange‐sama many years before she understands."`
`"Do you think...`
`......that she will eventually remember that I was a fun grandpa?"`
`"......Yes.`
` I am certain of it."`
`"...................................."`
`Kinzo's expression grew slightly darker.`
`......Eventually, even Ange will get older, and she will probably hear how the public at large regards Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
`The Ushiromiya Kinzo known by the public is completely different from the Kinzo who plays with his grandchildren.`
`When she learns,`
` ......will Ange remember the face of Kinzo the tyrant, known of by the world, ...or that gently smiling face?`
`".........If possible, I would hope for her to remember my smile, ......but such a thing is probably too much to ask for."`
`"................................."`
`"There's no way around it.`
` That's what children are."`
`"Oh, it's you."`
`"Children just eat up kindness, and it never remains in their memories.`
` By the time twelve years have passed, she will surely learn what a bizarre eccentric Ushiromiya Kinzo was.`
` Your smile is fated to be painted over by that and forgotten."`
`".........Most probably.`
` No matter how much I spoil her, my love will not be rewarded."`
`"However,`
` just as it takes a long time to remember what you owe your parents,`
` ......Ange will surely remember someday.`
` ......She will remember the smiles you showed her."`
`"Hmph......`
` Let her forget.`
` One smile from her is the greatest parting gift I could ever take with me, when my time comes.`
` This is...the essence of unrewarded love."`
`"I guess grandfathers are always unrewarded."`
`"Oh, but I have been rewarded.`
` With Ange's smile just now to look back upon,`
` I could happily pass on in my sleep tonight.`
` Wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha......"`
`With a lonely laugh, Kinzo spun around, setting his cloak fluttering.`
`This was all the love he could offer Ange as a grandfather.`
`Part of him wanted to be remembered, but he knew he mustn't wish for that.`
`That was...how unrewarded love worked.`
`After looking at Kinzo's back, Beato stared at Ange's back again.`
`"............Ange.`
` ......Even so, please remember it someday.`
` ......Remember the smile...that Kinzo once showed you."`
`Okay, whose quiz should I take next?`
`I'm gonna challenge more and more people, get more and more medals for getting them right, and get a wonderful present to show everyone.`
`Uncle Krauss and Auntie Natsuhi are over there.`
`They're looking this way and smiling.`
` I'm sure they've thought up some interesting puzzles.`
`There's Uncle Hideyoshi, beckoning for me to come over.`
`He's a fun uncle, so I'm sure he's thought up a fun question.`
`Behind him are Mom and Dad.`
`{n}They're waving at me, telling me to have lots of fun.`
`......Dad probably knows a lot of really hard questions.`
` He might be tough.`
`Over there is Auntie Rosa and Maria onee‐chan.`
`{n}It looks like they're reading a quiz book together, searching for a problem.`
`Every now and then, Maria onee‐chan glances over at me, saying "kihihihihi".`
`She can be mean sometimes, so I'm sure her puzzle won't be a nice one.`
`Beyond them are Battler onii‐chan, George onii‐chan, and Jessica onee‐chan.`
`......Battler onii‐chan is usually nice,`
` but he sometimes says really mean things, and I think he likes seeing me get confused.`
`......I get the feeling...`
`that he'll give me a really tough problem.`
`Is there anyone who looks like they won't be mean?`
`If I can, I'd like to start with some easy puzzles to warm me up.`
`All the way over there are Genji‐san and Doctor Nanjo.`
`{n}I don't think those two will be mean to me.`
`And then there's Shannon and Kanon.`
`Shannon knows about a lot of quizzes and fairy tales.`
` I'm sure she'll give me something unique.`
`Then, we have Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san, who are serving tea.`
`Kumasawa‐san might be tough.`
` ......I kinda think she'll give me a really confusing problem.`
`......It looks like everyone might be pretty tough.`
`{n}Hmmmmm.........`
`"Ange‐chan.`
` I've got a good one for ya...!`
` Over here!"`
`Uncle Hideyoshi is calling for me.`
`{n}......What should I do?`
` Should I go?`
`"Do you want to try Uncle Hideyoshi?"`
`"Yeah.`
` The order doesn't matter.`
` After all, I'm gonna challenge everyone."`
`I rolled up my sleeves and headed towards Uncle Hideyoshi.`
`"Wahahahahahaha, that's the way.`
` Mine's a tricky one, okay?"`
`"I wonder what sort of question you'll give her.`
` Don't make it too hard, okay?"`
`"It's okay if it's hard.`
` I'll solve it."`
`"Oooh, lookin' pretty confident there...!`
` Okay, here it comes!"`
`After clearing his throat, Uncle Hideyoshi started telling his question...`
`"Mine's a riddle.`
` Listen closely, now.`
` You know the story of {c:86EF9C:Momotarou}, right?"`
`"The boy who floated down a river in a peach?"`
`"That's right.`
` But you know, one day, an apple floated down that river."`
`"An apple??"`
`"Yep!`
` And the next day, a butternut squash floated down it!"`
`"I hate butternut squash."`
`"And then, the next day, a cabbage floated down it!`
` And the next day, a dill pickle did.`
` And the next day, an eggplant floated by.`
` And the day after that, a fig did!"`
`"*giggle*.`
` What a strange tale.`
` Did a greengrocer live upstream, or something?"`
`"Okay, here's the question.`
` What floated down the river the next day?!"`
`"Huh...?!"`
`"I've got it.`
` Do you get it, Ange‐chan?"`
`"I don't get it."`
`"Then I'll give you a hint.`
` There's an order to the things that float down the river.`
` Can you guess what order they're in?"`
`"Wahahahaha!`
` What a huge hint...!"`
`".........I don't...have a clue!"`
`"Wahhahahahahahahaha.`
` Guess that was a bit too hard...!"`
`"I know what floated down the river the day after that.`
` A hassaku orange, right?"`
`"Yep.`
` And the day after that, it was probably an i.........i...hmmm...`
` ......I can't think of a veggie that starts with "i"!"`
`I don't really get it.`
` Hmm... oh well.`
`"I know!`
` It's a grapefruit!"`
`"That's right.`
` It wasn't one of the choices, but green beans would have worked too."`
`The names all followed the alphabet.`
` Apple was "a".`
` Butternut squash was "b".`
` Cabbage was "c".`
`It kept going with "d", "e", and "f".`
`So, after "f" comes "g".`
` That's why the answer had to be something that started with "g".`
`"Thanks, Auntie Eva. I got it right thanks to your hint!"`
`"*giggle*.`
` You solved it by yourself, Ange‐chan.`
` Incredible."`
`"Yep, nice work!`
` Now, here's your medal for gettin' it right...!"`
`Hideyoshi took out a gold‐colored medal and placed it on my palm.`
`It felt heavy in my hand.`
` Yeah, this is what victory feels like.`
`I'd better keep it up!`
`"I've actually got one more medal here, I guess for me to give in place of Eva.`
` But I can't think of any more problems."`
`"Then maybe I should give Ange‐chan a puzzle."`
`"Huh?`
` You will?"`
`"Sure.`
` A quiz for the princess from her attendant{p:0:♪}`
` I've thought of a fun one, so please, have a go at it!"`
`Auntie Eva smiled brightly.`
`I want to get as many medals as possible, so of course, I want as many chances as I can get.`
`"Okay, I'll have a go at it."`
`"*giggle*. That's the spirit.`
` Okay, here it comes."`
`"We've talked about how I love to travel, haven't we?"`
`"Yeah.`
` You said you like traveling overseas a lot."`
`"That's right.`
` So this will be a puzzle about traveling.`
` There was a traveler in a certain place."`
`"A traveler?"`
`"First, the traveler walked five kilometers north."`
`"......Should I write this down on a piece of paper?"`
`"Don't worry.`
` The puzzle isn't that hard, so listening to it will be enough."`
`"The traveler first walked five kilometers north.`
` Then, he walked five kilometers to the east.`
` Then, he walked five kilometers to the south."`
`"............Five kilometers north.`
` Five kilometers east.`
` Five kilometers south.`
` ......You mean, like a blocky "n"?"`
`"That's right!`
` You work it out, and he's in a spot five kilometers to the east of where he started."`
`"That should be the case, right?`
` But, incredibly, this traveler ended up in the exact same spot he started.`
` ......Is something so mysterious possible?"`
`"Wahaha, there's no way!`
` His compass must've gone crazy."`
`"Of course it didn't!`
` Eheheheheh, do you know, Ange‐chan?"`
`"It wasn't because of his compass?`
` ......Is this a play on words?"`
`"No, this is a real quiz.`
` For a hint, why don't you try thinking about a globe?"`
`"............I don't get it."`
`I've never traveled overseas at all.`
`There might be some strange place in the world where you could walk in a blocky "n" and get back to where you started.`
`......Like the Bermuda Triangle, or something...`
`"Hmmm......`
` I guess that was a bit too hard for you, Ange‐chan."`
`"If you went north, then east, then south, there's no way you'd get back to where you started."`
`"But there is a place.`
` A place somewhere on the Earth's surface.`
` If you have a globe in your house, take a good look at it and think carefully.`
` If you just can't figure it out, try asking your dad, okay?"`
`"Okay, I'll ask him.`
` So tell me the right answer...!"`
`"*giggle*.`
` The right answer is a ve~ry cold place.`
` Where can you find cold places on a globe?`
` Think about it carefully.`
` Once you figure it out, you can try giving this quiz to the other kids in your class.`
` I'm sure they'll all be surprised."`
`Where can you find a cold place?`
` ......Hokkaido?`
`I don't think you end up at the start if you go north, east, then south in Hokkaido.`
`......Nnnngh.`
` I don't get it.`
` I give up.`
`"Okay, that's all for our puzzles!`
` Go ask one of the others to give you one!"`
`"Let's go!`
` Who should we challenge next?!"`
`If Auntie Eva knows puzzles this hard, I'm sure she must be good at quizzes.`
`If she's with me, I know we'll get lots and lots of medals.`
`Who will I ask next...?!`
`"I got it...!`
` It's a really cold place!`
` Yeah, it must be super cold there!"`
`"Perfect!`
` Ange‐chan, you must really be a genius, to get something like that at your age."`
`"If you start at the south pole, then after you go north, going east just draws a circle around the south pole.`
` So, anytime you go south again, that just takes you right back to the south pole."`
`"I tried to make it an extra hard puzzle,`
` but Ange‐chan was just too good."`
`"Congrats!`
` Here's another medal for ya."`
`I got a heavy, gold‐colored medal.`
`All right, I did it...!`
` Auntie Eva and I held up our fists in celebration.`
`"Okay, that's all for our puzzles!`
` Go ask one of the others to give you one!"`
`"Okay! Thank you, Uncle Hideyoshi...!"`
`"Your auntie's really clever...!`
` ......With the two of you together, you'll be gettin' medals right and left!"`
`"Yep, that's right!"`
`"Yeah.`
` Let's do our best together, Auntie Eva."`
`I dashed away.`
`{n}Who will I ask next...?!`
`Uncle Hideyoshi waved goodbye, smiling......`
`Hideyoshi and Eva watched as Ange ran off happily,`
` looking for the next quiz.`
`".........That kid can wear such a cute smile,`
` ......and I......will be the one who takes it away from her..."`
`"Eva..............."`
`Eva hung her head.`
` A single tear sparkled in her eye...`
`"Her reaction was only natural, considering how she felt.`
` ......But I...wasn't able to see past it and accept her feelings......"`
`"It can't be helped.`
` You're as human as anyone else.`
` It's not easy to put your emotions aside."`
`"Even so, it was my fault...!`
` After all, I already had the experience of bringing up a child, right?!`
` .........I should have become her mother.`
` ......And yet, I let sadness overwhelm me, ......and I didn't do it at all..."`
`"It can't be helped, I tell you...!`
` Don't think you were the only one at fault...!`
` You shouldn't blame yourself so much!"`
`By now, Eva was unable to hold back her sobs...`
`{n}Large tears dripped down her cheeks as she stared at the ground and shook...`
`"What a sin I've committed......`
` .........My sadness was no greater than hers...!`
` And yet, I decided that I was suffering the most, ......so I didn't accept her feelings......`
` .........I'm a failure of a mother...`
` I wasn't able.........to become a mother for her........."`
`"That's wrong.`
` ......You did your best for her, Eva nee‐san."`
`"Kyrie‐san..."`
`Kyrie and Rudolf were standing behind Eva now.`
`"I know how hard you tried to get along with Ange."`
`"......You held out well, Aneki.`
` Guess that daughter of ours really has been a pain, clueless about how much you suffered."`
`After the accident on Rokkenjima...`
`...Eva, the only person to leave Rokkenjima alive, adopted Ange, the girl who had survived the day through her absence.`
`......While they would eventually develop a sad and mutually painful relationship,`
` it wasn't like that at first.`
`As Ange's new mother and last remaining blood relative, Eva tried to shower her with love and affection.`
` Even as she fought back the sadness she herself felt.`
`However, Ange wasn't able to accept that kindness.`
`{n}She lashed out at Eva, the only one who had returned alive, and accused her of stealing her parents away from her.`
`......Eva, understanding the wounds that this little six‐year‐old girl bore, withstood these attacks.`
`{n}She grit her teeth and gave Ange her unconditional love.`
`However, .........the wounds that Eva herself bore were also extremely deep.`
`She was never rewarded for her sad efforts,`
` ............and the future that followed was a sorrowful one.`
`"You tried to show Ange the same affection you once showed George‐kun."`
`"But in the end, ......that was just for my own satisfaction...... Ange‐chan never felt any of it..."`
`"Ange was the one who couldn't accept it.`
` It isn't your fault."`
`"But who could possibly ask that of Ange‐chan when she was just six years old...?!`
` I should've held out much, much longer, until she could understand my feelings...!"`
`"Eva nee‐san.`
` If nothing else, trust me when I say this..."`
`"..........................."`
`"We......don't blame you in the slightest."`
`"......Kyrie‐san..............."`
`"Thank you so much for suffering so long for Ange's sake......`
` .........If that kid has a human heart, then I'm sure she'll recognize the affection you showed her someday."`
`"Thank you, Aneki.`
` We'll always be grateful......"`
`"............Isn't that wonderful, Eva......?`
` ......All of your efforts......have been witnessed......"`
`"Uuuhghuu......uuuuuhhghuu........."`
`"How are you doing, Ange‐sama?`
` If you wish, I, Gohda, would be pleased to challenge you."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` And I, Kumasawa, have a ve~ry tricky puzzle for you."`
`"It doesn't matter how hard it is.`
` I'm not alone.`
` I'll solve it with Auntie Eva!"`
`Gohda and Kumasawa offered to challenge me.`
`{n}I'll have to go up against everyone in the end, so it doesn't matter who comes next.`
`I waved at Auntie Eva to hurry up,`
` and she ran toward me.`
`"So, we're challenging this pair next?`
` Who will we start with?"`
`"Okay...Gohda‐san."`
`"Very well, as you wish.`
` Here is my puzzle."`
`"Hohhohohoho.`
` I'll warn you, it's a toughie."`
`"I'll still solve it.`
` I've gotten the knack of it."`
`"You'd better not underestimate Ange‐chan.`
` Right?!"`
`"Right!"`
`"My, my.`
` ...Well then, being the humble chef that I am, here is a puzzle about food and the kitchen."`
`"We'll fight together this time.`
` If you don't get it, just ask me to lend a hand.`
` I'll give you a hint."`
`"......If I get a hint, does that mean I don't get a medal?"`
`"It won't affect your medals at all, so feel free to ask away!"`
`"I've got it.`
` The hint here...is that the witch got home much later than usual."`
`"......What happens when she gets home later than usual?"`
`"Think carefully.`
` The food is always freshly made at the usual time, right?`
` So, ......what happens when she gets home long after that?"`
`".........I don't get it.`
` Food isn't supposed to talk."`
`"Well, uh, that's because this is a fairy tale puzzle......"`
`"Hohhohohohohoho...`
` It looks as though she didn't figure it out."`
`The answer I'd chosen at random was wrong, apparently.`
` ......Too bad.`
`"Okay, tell me the right answer.`
` You figured it out, right, Auntie Eva?`
` Tell me!"`
`"Alright.`
` The answer is—"`
`"Eva‐sama, if you wouldn't mind...!`
` They say recipes and riddle answers are best while they remain secret."`
`"You think so...?`
` Eheheh, I'll have to tell her sometime later when you aren't around, then."`
`"Yeah, it's a promise!"`
`But even if I hear the answer later on, I still got it wrong.`
`Oh well.`
` I'd better pull myself together and take a shot at Kumasawa‐san's puzzle.`
`"The ice cream!`
` The witch got back really late, so the ice cream would've melted.`
` So she couldn't eat it!"`
`"Nicely done!`
` See?`
` Ange‐chan is a clever girl, isn't she?"`
`"Congratulations, Ange‐sama!`
` Very impressive.`
` How quickly you saw through the puzzle that I, Gohda, put all my efforts into...!"`
`"It was totally easy.`
` Auntie Eva's puzzle was harder."`
`"*giggle*, thanks."`
`"Congratulations.`
` This medal is your prize for answering my question correctly."`
`"Thank you!"`
`Alright, that was easy.`
`{n}Now let's take a shot at Kumasawa‐san's puzzle.`
`"Looks like I'm up next.`
` Now, let's test Ange‐sama with my specially‐made, super‐hard puzzle.`
` Are you ready?"`
`"It's hard?`
` How hard?"`
`"Hohhohohohohoho.`
` You'll have to wait and see.`
` And now, let the mackerel dessert puzzle begin."`
`"Mackerel dessert...?"`
`"This is Kumasawa‐san we're talking about, so you can bet it'll be a strange one.`
` Be careful."`
`"Okay!"`
`"Auntie Eva, do you get it?"`
`"She says you have to change one letter, so the answer's probably some sort of word game.`
` We have to change one letter in "sabara" and see if we can make it into a des—`
`ah, I've got it!"`
`"Huh?!`
` What is it? What is it?!"`
`"Try using each of the letters in place of the "b".`
` In fact, that pretty much gives you the answer."`
`"Bzzzzt.`
` Wronnng."`
`"Huh?!`
` I don't get it!`
` I don't get it at all...!"`
`"Hohhohohoho, sorry, but wrong is wrong.`
` Perhaps it was a bit too hard for you, Ange‐sama."`
`"Come on, Kumasawa‐san.`
` That was a nasty puzzle..."`
`"It doesn't make sense!`
` There's no way you could make a dessert out of mackerel!`
` What's the answer?`
` Tell me!"`
`"Hohohoho, it's no fun if I tell you.`
` If you don't guess it quick, ......then you really will be having mackerel for dessert.`
` Ihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi......"`
`"Tell me, tell me!"`
`"Nope."`
`Kumasawa smiled cheerily, but remained stubborn.`
`{n}No matter how much I bother her, she probably won't tell me the answer.`
`"That concludes our puzzles.`
` There are probably others waiting for you to challenge them, Ange‐sama.`
` Please, on to the next challenge."`
`"We're both rooting for you, Ange‐sama."`
`"Okay!`
` I'll keep on trying hard and getting more and more medals!"`
`"That's the spirit. Don't let it get you down.`
` Plenty more chances left!"`
`We rushed away.`
`{n}Okay, who should we take on next...?!`
`"I got it!`
` The new letter is "h"!`
` If you change the "b" in Sabara to an "h", you get Sahara!"`
`"Hohhohohohoho,`
` that's correct."`
`"The Sahara is a desert,`
` and the last line said you could make a great "desert" out of sabara!"`
`"I figured out a trick in Japanese and English!`
` Am I awesome? Am I awesome?!"`
`"You're so smart, Ange‐chan!`
` You deserve a pat on the head...!"`
`"Nnnn.`
` I like it when you do that."`
`"Just change a single letter, and even mackerel can make a fine desert.`
` Are you starting to see how omnipotent mackerel is?"`
`"The day I'm forced to serve a joke like that for dessert, I imagine heads will roll......"`
`"I wouldn't like it either.`
` I like ice cream for dessert."`
`"Ahahahahahaha, of course.`
` By the way, we shouldn't be worried, should we?`
` What about tonight's dessert?"`
`"Ohohohohoho......`
` I can hardly wait to surprise everyone with the mackerel fruit parfait waiting there in the kitchen!"`
`"Nooooooo!!"`
`Everyone burst out laughing.`
`For some time after that, I was tormented by the terrifying image of a parfait neatly topped with mackerel bits...`
`"What a shame......`
` I tried so hard to stop you from getting that prize, but you solved my best riddle like it was nothing."`
`Though she said that, Kumasawa smiled.`
`{n}A gold‐colored medal glittered in her wrinkly hand.`
`Ange took it.`
`"Well then, that's all for our puzzles."`
`"Please keep up the pace, get more and more medals, and win that splendid prize from the Master!"`
`"Okay! Thank you.`
` I'm going to think even harder next time...!`
` We did it, Auntie Eva!"`
`"Eheheh!`
` Let's keep it up!"`
`We rushed away.`
`{n}Okay, who should we take on next...?!`
`"It seems that all of a sudden, the tiny girl who used to hide and tremble in Kyrie‐sama's shadow...`
`has grown to be so bright and cheery..."`
`"......With each passing family conference, one can feel the growth of those youngsters.`
` After just a few years more, Ange‐sama will surely learn of love, of makeup,`
` and will eventually grow to become a true lady."`
`"Very true......`
` If she grows normally with the passing time, that is..."`
`A cruel fate...`
`...forces the chick called Ange into a lonely future.`
`If an egg isn't warmed, it won't hatch.`
`{n}The egg she is now will not be warmed by anyone, and neither will it hatch...`
`"Inside that frozen egg,`
` will Ange‐sama have no choice but to face that isolated future...?"`
`"......An egg's shell can always be broken from the inside.`
` ......Even if a cold shell is very, very hard, that doesn't mean it cannot be broken."`
`"Does Ange‐sama have the strength to do that?"`
`"Is she capable of achieving that or not...?`
` I hear that question is what this final game is all about."`
`"Perhaps we should have sent her a clearer message.`
` ......If the egg cannot be warmed, could we not at least strike it from the outside to make it easier to crack?"`
`"If a chick too powerless to even break its own shell is forced outside of the egg,`
` it won't be able to withstand the cold winds.`
` Ange‐sama will have to find that power and resilience herself."`
`"......I understand that she needs power and resilience,`
` but can we not somehow explain it to her?"`
`"Words cannot be given. They can only be accepted.`
` ......No matter what we try to give Ange‐sama, it will be meaningless unless she accepts it."`
`"............You are right.`
` No matter what we try to tell Ange‐sama, it won't matter unless she listens."`
`"Hohohoho......`
` We can do nothing but watch over her.`
` You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink."`
`"Ange‐sama must choose a better future for herself.`
` ......We can only pray that she does."`
`"If Ange‐sama does not abandon herself to anger for the sole purpose of distracting herself from her resignation and sadness,`
` ......if she can just be honest about that one, single wish that she truly desires more than anything else,`
` then you can be certain that she will make her greatest wish come true."`
`"It is ironic.`
` ......Since the very beginning, she has been denying that greatest wish of hers herself."`
`"Laughter brings happiness.`
` Tears bring misfortune.`
` Those who believe will be saved.`
` ......People have the power to create their own futures by the strength of their emotions."`
`"I wish we could just let her hear those words......"`
`"Battler‐sama is very strict.`
` ......He's hoping that Ange‐sama will realize it by her own power alone...and is not permitting even words of this nature to be told to her."`
`".........It seems we can do nothing but watch over her."`
`"And so, let us pray, at least.`
` Pray that she grasps the world she desires most with her own hands."`
`"Oh, have you selected me?"`
`"Yeah.`
` I'll have to face everyone sooner or later.`
` Right, Auntie Eva?!"`
`"Right!`
` Come on, let's have a puzzle.`
` We'll solve it in a flash!"`
`"Hahahaha.`
` I see, I see.`
` Then it seems I must make it a good one."`
`"Genji.`
` You should give her one as well.`
` A tough one."`
`"As you wish.`
` ......In that case, a tough one it shall be..."`
`Whoa.`
`I'd been thinking that Genji‐san would give me a simple puzzle, but now he's saying it'll be tough.`
` Scary.`
`But I'll have to beat him at some point.`
` I can't let myself get scared.`
`"Then let us start with mine.`
` I am a doctor,`
` so how about an ambulance puzzle?"`
`"The ??? is a number?`
` But "emergency" is a word.`
` You can't add a number to a word, right?"`
`"That part sounds like some kind of pun.`
` "Kyuu" means "nine", so "Kyuu, kyuu" makes you think "nine, nine", right?"`
`"So, if you add "???" to 99, you get an ambulance?"`
`"Hmm. Why does some number added to 99 get you an ambulance?`
` ............Ah, I've got it!"`
`"Huh, really?!`
` Hey, what is it?!"`
`"I'll give you a hint.`
` The "different kind of vehicle with a red flashing light" is a police car.`
` *giggle*, you're starting to get it now, aren't you?"`
`"Huh? ......Nnnnn......`
`......I don't get it..."`
`"Oh, are you having trouble?`
` I thought it was an easy puzzle."`
`It's a bit annoying to hear that about a puzzle I don't get.`
`Still, no matter how annoyed I get, I still don't have a clue what the answer is.`
`"Aw, so close.`
` I thought you'd made it pretty far too..."`
`Apparently, Auntie Eva knows the answer.`
` She looked disappointed that I hadn't figured it out too.`
`".........Mmmmmhh...`
` Ah, yes, I have it!`
` If you subtract two from an ambulance, then add on 60, you can even learn the weather."`
`"Well done, Kinzo‐san.`
` It seems I must hand this medal over to you."`
`"Wahahahahahaha.`
` Sorry, Ange.`
` This medal's all mine."`
`".........F‐fine, see if I care."`
`The gold medal passed from Nanjo to Kinzo.`
`That medal was supposed to be mine......`
` It's no use regretting it now.`
`If you subtract two from and add 60 to an ambulance...?`
` How would that tell you the weather...??`
`"Hmm, what was the number for the weather forecasting service again?"`
`"............???"`
`Yeah, I don't have a clue.`
`{n}I'll just have to pick myself up and have a go at Genji's puzzle.`
`"20!`
` "Kyuu‐kyuu" sounds like "99", and if you add 20 to 99, you get 119.`
` That's the emergency number for ambulances!"`
`"And if you subtract 20 from 130, you get 110.`
` That's the emergency number for calling the police."{n}{i:(Add 20 to 99 and write it in reverse to get 911, the US number for both.)}`
`"Splendid! That is correct.`
` I knew you were a quick thinker, Ange‐san."`
`"Oooooooh, well done, Angeeeeeeee!`
` What a clever granddaughter I have!"`
`"Congratulations.`
` This medal belongs to you."`
`At any rate, the gold medal glittering in Nanjo's hand is now mine.`
`Okay, now I'll defeat Genji too and get another one.`
`"Yes, that's the spirit.`
` Let's keep on solving them!"`
`"Your turn, Genji‐san."`
`"My friend here doesn't speak much, but his knowledge is quite extensive.`
` Even I cannot wait to see what sort of puzzle he whips up."`
`"Now then, Ange‐sama.`
` Prepare yourself.`
` The puzzle starts now."`
`......I've never heard anyone say "prepare yourself" like that when giving a quiz.`
`I started to get so tense that my stomach began to hurt...`
`"It'll be okay.`
` Hang in there!"`
`Auntie Eva gripped my hand firmly, and my stomachache got a little better.`
`"......Ange‐sama, have you learned division?"`
`"Y‐yeah.`
` I learned it in cram school."`
`"Incredible, a six‐year‐old who knows division?"`
`"Then there should be no problems.`
` Here it comes."`
`This is bad...`
` I did learn division, but I'm not very good at it......`
`"Half of its remaining length burns away each hour, right...?`
` After the first hour, it's burned down to half of {nobr:5 cm}.`
` During the next hour, it burns down to half of that.`
` And during the third hour, it burns down to half of that again......"`
`"......I can't really do it without a calculator.`
` Do you know the answer, Auntie Eva?"`
`"Ah, ......I've got it.`
` *giggle*, this is a pretty mean puzzle."`
`"Why is it mean?"`
`"This has nothing to do with division.`
` Read through the puzzle again carefully."`
`......Umm,`
` ......what was it, again......?`
`"My sincere apologies, but that is incorrect."`
`"Huh?!`
` Why?!`
` I know I did the math right...!"`
`"You see, ...there's no need for math in this puzzle.`
` Yep, he tricked us good this time..."`
`"Wahhahahahahahaha.`
` Too bad, Ange.`
` Did you get it, Nanjo?"`
`"Yes, of course.`
` Division is unnecessary.`
` This was an easy puzzle, one that even Ange‐san could have solved."`
`Not only Auntie Eva, but everyone else said that math wasn't needed.`
`And I worked so hard on that division......`
`"That is all for my puzzle.`
` I believe several others are waiting for you to challenge them, Ange‐sama.`
` Perhaps you ought to search for the next challenge."`
`"Good luck, Ange‐san.`
` I am rooting for you."`
`"That's right.`
` This is no time to get down!`
` Now's our chance to turn things around."`
`"Yeah!`
` I'll try even harder and get lots of medals!"`
`We dashed away.`
`There are still many people waiting to give me puzzles.`
` I have tons of chances to get medals.`
`Okay, who should I challenge next...?!`
`"......After one hour, {nobr:5 cm} becomes {nobr:2.5 cm},`
` ...and in the next hour, that becomes {nobr:1.25 cm},`
` ...and in the next hour, that becomes {nobr:0.625 cm}......"`
`"..........................."`
`"Ange‐chan.`
` You don't need to use math.`
` Make sure you remember the problem clearly...`
` How long......is the candle when the flame goes out...?"`
`"Ah!`
` That was a close one...!`
` The candle goes out when it's {nobr:1 cm} long, so the rest doesn't matter!"`
`The flame on this candle dies when the candle is {nobr:1 cm} in length.`
`{n}In other words, it can never get shorter than {nobr:1 cm}.`
`So the right answer is the fifth choice, "About {nobr:10 mm}"...!`
`"That's right...!"`
`"You are correct."`
`"Oooh, splendidly done, Ange!`
` How clever of you, not to be misled!"`
`"I didn't even need division.`
` I almost got tricked...!"`
`"You were pretty mean there, Genji‐san.`
` You even asked her if she could do division.`
` That was a trap, right?"`
`"Correct.`
` My humble apologies."`
`"Hahhahahahaha.`
` After all, Genji‐san is the sort who can trick you without changing his expression in the slightest."`
`"Congratulations, Ange‐sama.`
` This medal is proof that you have correctly solved my puzzle."`
`"Thanks!`
` Eheheh, I got another medal, Auntie Eva...!"`
`"Heheh, nice going!"`
`"I'll get lots more.`
` I'll get a ton, and then Grandfather will give me a great prize!"`
`"Mm.`
` Give it all you've got, my granddaughter...!"`
`"Good luck, Ange‐san.`
` I am rooting for you."`
`"There must be others waiting for you.`
` Perhaps you ought to search for the next challenge."`
`"Okay! Thank you.`
` I'll try even harder now...!"`
`We dashed away.`
`There are still many people waiting to give me puzzles.`
` I have tons of chances to get medals.`
`Okay, who should I challenge next...?!`
`After Ange and Eva left,`
` ......Battler, who had been watching their progress, came over.`
`"How is Ange doing?"`
`"Oh, Battler.`
` I am not certain of her progress, but she does seem to be enjoying herself."`
`"I heard your puzzle, Genji‐san.`
` Even I was almost taken in back there."`
`"You honor me."`
`"Still, it's not quite what I'd have expected.`
` Who'd have thought that you'd give a trick question like that?`
` I figured you'd make a straightforward, simple puzzle."`
`"Hahahahahahaha.`
` You might expect such a thing from him, silent as he is,`
` ......but he is much more of a schemer than he appears."`
`"Very true.`
` If you play a chess match against him, you'll see that right away."`
`"He even fools me, from time to time.`
` He'll trick me right to my face, with that stern, serious expression of his.`
` He has always been like that.`
` And yet, despite the numerous occasions on which he has fooled me in the past, I keep on getting tricked.`
` Wah{0}hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha."`
`"Come to think of it,`
` .........what sort of relationship do you and Genji‐san have?"`
`For just an instant, Kinzo glanced at Genji's face.`
`Apparently, he didn't plan on touching on this subject if Genji had any objections.`
`However, Genji began to answer the question himself, as though the matter was no longer deserving of secrecy.`
`"......I knew the Master once...in Taiwan."`
`"Wahaha, "knew me", he says...!`
` We were partners in crime, you might say!`
` The two of us were both prodigal sons of rich families.`
` A pair of ruffians who caused their parents nothing but trouble."`
`"Genji‐san, a prodigal son...?`
` That's a surprise......`
` So, Genji‐san, you also moved to Taiwan and met Grandfather there?"`
`"...............No.`
` I am a native of Taiwan."`
`"Genji‐san was born in Taiwan.`
` .........Well, since Taiwan was under Japanese rule before the war, he is still Japanese, of course."`
`"He was a man who hated losing.`
` When we first met, we fought all the time.`
` Once we hit it off, we became the best of friends."`
`"......There was a lot of disorder and conflict after the war.`
` The Master is the one who saved me during that chaotic period.`
` ......If I spent the rest of my life trying to repay that debt, it would not be enough to pay it back in full."`
`".........Don't say that, my friend.`
` ......If only I had been a little more persuasive, I might have saved your family as well...`
` I was too feckless to save anyone but you..."`
`I don't know much about the details of Taiwan's history,`
` but apparently, there was still a lot of chaos there even after the war ended and Japan pulled out.`
`Kinzo, predicting this chaos before it happened,`
` worked out a way for Genji and his family to escape.`
`However, Genji's family possessed great wealth in Taiwan.`
` They were unable to abandon it, and they decided to remain there.`
`This wealth had been built up thanks to their close relationship with the Japanese‐run government of Taiwan.`
`The new regime after the war wasn't likely to welcome them with open arms.`
`Much mayhem and confusion followed.`
` And Genji was the only one who escaped harm.`
`......I don't know what happened to make this man, referred to by Kinzo as a troublesome prodigal son,`
` change so drastically to become the person he is today.`
`That is a story of friendship between the two of them,`
` ......and there could be hardly any point in an unrelated person sifting through history books to argue for their personal interpretation.`
`They had been good friends since long ago, and they owed each other their lives.`
` Though the troubled times had tossed them about, their friendship held firm for decades...`
`Genji's role was now that of the butler,`
` ......but when the two of them were alone in the study, they sometimes shared a drink and reminisced about the days of their youth.`
`......And they're still that way today.`
`Leaving Kinzo and Genji to reminisce, Battler walked off on his own.`
`It would be rude to ask for any more detail, and there was no need to know.`
`Kinzo and Genji had been friends since long, long ago.`
`{n}That information was nothing new.`
`"What do you think?`
` Do you want to challenge Auntie Natsuhi and Uncle Krauss next?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Let's beat them!"`
`"Hahahaha. Very well, we'll play along."`
`"The two of us have prepared some formidable puzzles for you."`
`"Should I go first?`
` Or you?"`
`"I will start."`
`"Very well."`
`"Listen closely to what I'm about to say.`
` White black white black white ? black white black white black white."`
`"Huh?`
` White black white black......huh??"`
`"I'll say it once more.`
` White black white black white ? black white black white black white.`
` ......What does the question mark stand for?"`
`This is......a really hard one.`
`White black white black white ? black white black white black white.`
`It looks like the white and black are alternating, but the question mark is between a white and a black.`
`Is it......gray??`
` Is it that easy...?`
`"Th‐...this is a surprisingly hard one, coming from you, Natsuhi nee‐san......"`
`Auntie Eva was groaning.`
` Apparently, this one's really hard.`
`"I‐is it really so hard...?"`
`"......There's a chance that some people won't understand, if they haven't had the right experiences."`
`"Eva‐san aside, I think Ange‐chan would have seen it a lot at school and kindergarten......"`
`"Wh‐what? Are you saying I'll never get this one?"`
`Is it a problem that I could get easier than Auntie Eva......?`
`......It's hard.`
`"The hint for this one is probably what Natsuhi nee‐san said, about something you might see in a school or kindergarten.`
` ......Do you know what it is, Ange‐chan?"`
`"No, I'm stuck."`
`"See, even Ange‐chan says she's stuck!`
` Give her at least a little hint."`
`"I, I see.`
` Then, a hint......`
` White black white black... They may be different colors, but you get a beautiful sound no matter which you push."`
`"A beautiful sound......?`
` Are these black and white things something that make sounds?"`
`"Black and white things that make a sound when you push them......?"`
`"............I don't get it."`
`"I give up too.`
` ......It seems even you know some pretty hard puzzles, Natsuhi nee‐san."`
`"Hahahaha.`
` It's the sort of puzzle that brings out one's upbringing.`
` Perhaps it was a bit too hard for you."`
`"Wh‐what did you saaaaaaay...?!"`
`"......Auntie Natsuhi.`
` Could you tell me the answer?"`
`"The answer is...a keyboard."`
`"A keyboard?`
` Like on a piano?"`
`"That's right.`
` The blacks and whites are the pattern of colors on a keyboard.`
` In which case, you must already know the right answer."`
`Auntie Natsuhi smiled at me, but I don't really remember what a keyboard looks like.`
`......Aw, too bad.`
`I'd better have a go at Uncle Krauss's puzzle and redeem myself.`
`"Ready?`
` It's Nii‐san's turn now.`
` We'll solve it in a flash and teach him a lesson, okay?"`
`"That black and white thing, ......it's a keyboard!`
` Like a piano!"`
`"Ah, ......is that it?!`
` It's a keyboard?!"`
`Something that can be found in kindergartens and schools, which is covered with a line of white and black things.`
`It's an instrument.`
`{n}Like a keyboard on a piano or a melodica.`
`"The first two black keys are between "do", "re", and "mi".`
` The set of three black keys are between "fa", "so", "la", and "ti"......"`
`"It started "white black white black white ? black", so......the three white ones are "do", "re", and "mi"......"`
`"There is no black key between "mi" and "fa".`
` So, "fa" comes right after "mi"!"`
`"And since the question mark comes after "mi", the right answer is "fa".`
` ......In other words—"`
`""The right answer is white!""`
`"Correct.`
` I thought it might have been a bit too hard, but you did well."`
`"Splendidly done, you two.`
` Go ahead, Natsuhi."`
`"Congratulations, Ange‐chan.`
` Here's my medal for you."`
`"Alright!`
` Auntie Eva, I got another one!"`
`"Things are moving along nicely.`
` Next up is Nii‐san's puzzle.`
` Let's solve it in a flash and teach him a lesson, okay?"`
`"How interesting.`
` Looks like it's time you were taught a lesson."`
`"Stop it, Auntie Eva! Don't provoke him!`
` You'll make the puzzle harder!"`
`"Heheheheheheh.`
` If there's anyone you have to blame, it's Eva!`
` Now take this brain‐twister!`
` Here's a puzzle about the tenants of a skyscraper I've invested in."`
`"I don't know anything about this skyscraper,`
` so there's no way I could know......"`
`I know what's on floors 1, 2, and 14, so the answer must be one of the other floors.`
` There's no doubt about that.`
`"Heheheheh.`
` Do you give up?"`
`"I, I won't give up, kiii!!`
` So Murakoshi Publishing Co., Ltd. is definitely on some floor?!"`
`"Some floor, yes.`
` But not the somethingth floor."`
`"What's the difference...?"`
`"......Ah.`
` ................................."`
`Auntie Eva suddenly stumbled on something.`
`{n}Then, she started counting on her fingers, starting from the first floor......`
`"I've got it, Ange‐chan...!`
` Try saying them aloud, starting from "the first floor"...!`
` There's only one that fits the question!"`
`"Huh?`
` Wh‐what do you mean......?"`
`".........I don't get it."`
`"It isn't on "the somethingth floor", but it is on "some floor". That's the trick."`
`"That's right.`
` Though, in a way, the answer is right there in the question."`
`"What do you mean...?"`
`"For example, let's take the fourteenth floor.`
` "The "fourteenth floor" is the "somethingth floor", right?`
` But "the first floor" isn't the "somethingth floor"... you wouldn't call it "the firTH floor"."`
`"Precisely.`
` And with the first and second floors ruled out, there's only one other that doesn't end in "th"."`
`"A‐......ah........."`
`By this point, even I had figured out the answer.`
`If only I'd paid a bit more attention to the way Uncle Krauss said the question......`
`"Hahahahahahaha.`
` Too bad.`
` Looks like I'll be keeping this medal."`
`"The third floor!"`
`"Mgh..."`
`"Well done, you got it...!`
` Ignoring the first two floors, the only floor that doesn't end in "th" is the third."`
`"Yeah!`
` "The third floor" fits, but all the other ones after that are the "somethingth" floor."`
`"N‐......nicely done...`
` And even I didn't figure it out until I had the answer given to me......"`
`Apparently, Uncle Krauss once had this puzzle shown to him, and he wasn't able to answer it right.`
`He looks a bit bitter that a kid like me was able to solve it.`
`......I think what's really frustrating him is Auntie Eva solving it, not me.`
` Weird.`
`"Come on, now.`
` Let's see that medal."`
`"This medal is a mark of Ange‐chan's intelligence.`
` It's not for you, Eva."`
`"Heh, sore loser...!"`
`"Thank you, Uncle Krauss.`
` Am I awesome? Am I awesome?!"`
`"Very much so.`
` You're a more flexible thinker than your uncle.`
` I am proud to have you as a niece."`
`"That's all for our puzzles."`
`"I do hope you enjoyed them."`
`"I did!`
` Thank you, Auntie Natsuhi and Uncle Krauss!"`
`"I hope you can enjoy all the tricky and interesting questions without worrying about your medal count too much."`
`"We all hope that this becomes a wonderful night, just for you."`
`"We really are enjoying ourselves."`
`"Yeah!`
` We're having a lot of fun!"`
`Krauss and Natsuhi smiled at them as they dashed away.`
`"Oh, it's you, Natsuhi.`
` How did your puzzles go?"`
`"We selected our questions as carefully as we could,`
` ......but I'm not sure how much they enjoyed them."`
`On the other side of the room, Ange and Eva were counting the medals they had gathered so far.`
`Ange and Eva.`
` ......Such an unexpected pairing, but they looked like they were having a great time.`
`"......A future parent and child, unrelated by blood.`
` Watching them like this, they look just like a normal parent and child."`
`"Yes, they do.`
` .........Bonds between people are nurtured by the heart.`
` Ties of blood do not bond as strongly."`
`After saying this,`
` ......Natsuhi bit back her own words and stared at the floor.`
`"What's wrong?"`
`".........I was just...surprised that I would dare to say such words......"`
`"........................`
` ......You don't need to worry about me."`
`"Because I rejected you, ......you met a painful fate in so many worlds...`
` ......All of that is my responsibility..."`
`"I understand how you felt.`
` ......Unable to become pregnant, you were forced to feel shame for many years.`
` In that situation, any woman would be shocked if they were handed a baby whose parentage they didn't even know, ...and then told to adopt them."`
`"......That was no reason...`
`...for me to push you off a cliff..."`
`"True.`
` You will have to carry that cross for the rest of your life."`
`"......Yes.`
` I am prepared to do so..."`
`"In that case, the suffering you must endure will come from the cross you bear.`
` Not from me."`
`"You don't......despise me...?"`
`"Look, don't make that dejected face.`
` ......In fact, no, ......I think I'll say the opposite.`
` As long as you do continue making that dejected face, I will feel no desire to punish you.`
` As long as you continue to carry that cross,`
` I will feel no desire to hate you."`
`"Despite what I did to you, ......you still don't hate me......?"`
`"Oh, I did hate you.`
` I hated your guts.`
` I hated you so much, I wanted to hang up a pillow with your picture on it and use it as a punching bag!"`
`"But, as I watched you, that feeling faded away.`
` ......You regretted and lamented.`
` And I'm sure you'll never forget that feeling for as long as you live."`
`"How could I forget......?`
` ......After all, I'm a murderer........."`
`"You burdened yourself with one hell of a heavy cross, didn't you?`
` I feel compassion for you now.`
` I'm serious.`
` I mean, all of this is really Kinzo's fault."`
`"It's his fault for having an illegitimate child in the first place!`
` And the way he forced that child on you was even worse!`
` Instead of "you can't give birth, so adopt this kid",`
` he should at least have been able to avoid hurting you by saying something like "please take care of this poor child".`
` Men! That Kinzo...!"`
`".............................."`
`"I no longer hate you.`
` Does the cross you bear not feel any lighter for that?"`
`"It doesn't.`
` ......I still don't know how I can make up for what I did to you."`
`"Then let's do it this way.`
` Hold out your arms."`
`"H‐......huh?`
` L‐...like this...?"`
`As Natsuhi spread her arms uncertainly,`
` Beato leapt forward and hugged her tight.`
`"......U‐umm,`
` ......th‐this is a little........."`
`"I'll never say this again, so let me say it once.`
` ......After all, I never had a chance to meet my mother."`
`Still hugging Natsuhi, Beato spoke in a whisper.`
`{n}She spoke those words that she would certainly never say again...`
`"Thank you for worrying so much for my sake.`
` ......But I really don't hate you anymore.`
` Please, believe that,`
` ............Mother."`
`"......{f:5:B}‐.........{f:5:Beatrice}..............."`
