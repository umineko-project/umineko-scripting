`It was the largest banquet hall in this huge hotel.`
`The many guests that filled the room chattered and applauded the person receiving an award trophy on top of the stage.`
`The sign in front said "Biggs Publishing Company Awards Ceremony".`
`"And now, I would like to begin the novel category.`
` The winner...is a novel everyone here will be very familiar with.`
` The story that started a worldwide movement,`
` that continues to grow in leaps and bounds, the fantasy adventure novel...`
`‘Sakutarou's Great Adventure’!"`
`The projector in front of the audience showed a brief summary of the series.`
`It was...a lengthy fantasy adventure novel that was already more than eight installments long.`
`The thrilling fantasy story told of the adventures of Sakutarou, a cowardly vegeta‐lion who makes friends, learns through his experiences,`
` and grows in his search for the One Fragment.`
`The main character's catch phrase, "I'll become the King of the Beasts", was even one of the candidates for the Best Phrase to Come Into Modern Slang Award.`
`In addition to being a thrill to read, the books also contained many messages for children to learn from,`
` earning it high praise as an adventure novel that parents and kids could enjoy reading together.`
`However, it hadn't received praise like this from the beginning.`
`For the first six volumes, it went almost entirely unnoticed,`
` but last year, when foreign translations of the series began, it got its big break and suddenly became a huge topic of conversation.`
`Even before this series, the author had created quite a lot of works,`
` but none of those had achieved any public acclaim.`
`However, after this sudden rise in notoriety, her previous works were being reevaluated one after another.`
`It's probably fair to say that recognition of her works was very late in coming.`
`"Miss Kotobuki...!!`
` Congratulations on your award!"`
`"Your latest, "Sakutarou and the Witch's Island", was truly an excellent read!"`
`Publishing company executives repeatedly showered her with praise.`
`"Sakutarou's Great Adventure".`
`{n}The author's name...was Kotobuki Yukari ({p:0:寿ゆかり}).`
`Nearly all of her royalties were sent to a fund to support needy children,`
` and she herself served as the director at several protective institutions.`
`Some envious people tried to call this "fake charity", but the more that people learned about her, the more those voices withered and died away.`
`Kotobuki Yukari.`
`By now, that name rang loud and clear across Japan.`
`She sat in a chair, cheerfully chatting with the people who came to greet her.`
`Last year, it was discovered that she had developed a small tumor, and after the surgery, her physical strength had dropped sharply.`
`Because of this, even in this stand‐up awards party, she was given a chair and sat down while greeting people.`
`Some people lamented, saying that if only she had been twenty or even ten years younger,`
` ......she might have left her mark in history as one of the greatest authors in the twenty‐first century.`
`It had taken so long for her to receive the praise she deserved......`
`She could no longer be called young.`
`{n}Even so, her determination to write had not wavered in the slightest.`
`The story had gone around that, even during her stay in the hospital, most of her time had been spent typing away.`
`She always said the same thing.`
`{n}That she hadn't finished telling everything she needed to tell.`
`Did she mean that she hadn't fully completed "Sakutarou's Great Adventure"?`
`This is how she answered when this question was asked by a journalist...`
`If, by writing even one more book, I can teach just one more child how to find happiness...`
`Then I will spend the rest of my life to write every book, every page that I can.`
`Because I still haven't fully conveyed the precious teachings I was given......`
`"Miss Kotobuki, congratulations on your award!`
` I hear the movie adaptation has been getting splendid reviews as well!`
` From what I hear, you're set to break records with the best‐selling books of the year!"`
`"Thank you very much for your kind words.`
` It's more than I deserve......"`
`"Oh, I forgot to tell you...!`
` My name is Eks, head of Company X's first editorial department."`
`"It is an honor to meet you...`
` I hope we have a chance to work together sometime..."`
`"......Actually, Miss Kotobuki.`
` ......I, uh, apologize for being abrupt,`
` ......but do you happen to know of...`
`the mystery writer called Hachijo Tohya?"`
`"Hachijo......Tohya...... ......What about her?"`
`She recalled that name for the first time in several decades.`
`{n}She hadn't expected to ever hear it again.`
`"So you do know of Hachijo?`
` I don't suppose you've ever met...?"`
`"No, I have not...`
` I did go to visit once, but I was an unknown back then.`
` And, since I suddenly barged into the publishing company office, it's hardly surprising that I was refused an interview......"`
`"Oh, I didn't know that...!`
` Could it be that you were a fan of Hachijo's work...?"`
`"No.`
` I just wanted to find out what sort of person Hachijo was......"`
`"I see, I see.`
` .......Well, the truth is...about that novelist... ......Hachijo Tohya would like to meet with you discreetly."`
`"........................`
` ......To meet with...me?"`
`"Yes.`
` It would not be a formal interview or anything, just a personal meeting, off the record......`
` If you are interested, we would be delighted to make the arrangements...`
` Oh, and of course!`
` This has nothing to do with work!"`
`.........Hachijo Tohya...wants to meet...Kotobuki Yukari.`
`Just like I realized that Itouikukuro was Hachijo Tohya,`
` ......did she use my name to figure out my identity?`
`The Rokkenjima mystery, which was sometimes called the greatest social phenomenon at the turn of the century.`
`That uproar, which dragged in enthusiasts from across the world,`
` had suddenly subsided after an event held by Hachijo Tohya, where she was going to "unveil Ushiromiya Eva's diary containing the truth".`
`Though she had set up the event herself, she then outrageously disappeared without releasing the contents of the diary, drawing harsh criticism for doing so.`
`However, at the same time, this event resurrected a very, very natural feeling within the public:`
` that all of this was prying into a terrible accident with many victims only for the sake of curiosity.`
`And so, the frenzy surrounding the Rokkenjima mystery faded away quietly...`
`Hachijo Tohya.`
` No, Itouikukuro.`
`She caught the public eye as a Forger of Rokkenjima mysteries.`
`She claimed to have reached the truth, and released groundbreaking works of fiction one after another.`
` She became famous as the driving force behind the Rokkenjima mystery.`
`After realizing that Itouikukuro was Hachijo Tohya, I went to her publishing company to ask for an interview, but I didn't get one.`
`At the time, I despised her.`
`Back in the beginning, I thought she might have used the Rokkenjima mystery as a publicity stunt to advance herself,`
` .........but now I feel a bit grateful to her.`
`If she hadn't refused to show the diary in such an outrageous way,`
` the Rokkenjima cat box might still be the plaything of countless goats.`
`She is indeed a Forger who toyed with the cat box, and I still have an uneasy feeling about her.`
`However, at the same time, she is the one who, practically speaking, allowed Rokkenjima to rest in peace.`
`And......did she really reach the truth or not?`
`How is it that she reached something that {i:even from my perspective} was infinitely close to the truth?`
`Even now, all these years later,`
` .........that's something I'd love to know......if it's possible to find out.`
`"What do you think, Miss Kotobuki......?`
` Of course, this is not an urgent request.`
` I was told to tell you to take your time in making your decision if you wished..."`
`"I understand.`
` ......Does Hachijo Tohya live near the city?"`
`"I was told that a meeting near here would be satisfactory at any time...!"`
`"I see.`
` ......In that case, can I ask you to arrange a meeting for us in a quiet coffee shop next Sunday...?"`
`"Yes, as you wish...!`
` Thank you, thank you very much!`
` I believe Hachijo will be delighted as well...!"`
`"I have one condition."`
`"Yes, whatever you say...!"`
`"I am not going to discuss business, so please refrain from sending anyone from the editing department."`
`"But of course! We will do as you say."`
`"Madam Hachijo and I will meet alone, just the two of us.`
` Can I count on you to keep that promise...?"`
`"Well, as to that.........`
` ......We would, umm, appreciate it if you kept this quiet, but..."`
`"What is it...?"`
`"......Well, the truth is...`
` ......The works of Hachijo Tohya are written by two people.`
` To the outside world, those books were written by a single female author,`
` .......but there is actually a second author, a man...`
` ......The pair of them asked for a chance to meet you......"`
`As soon as I heard that,`
` ......I felt a premonition.`
`......How had Hachijo Tohya, a person with no connections to the Ushiromiya family, managed to write about their private circumstances in such detail?`
`I already felt a premonition of a certain kind of miracle......`
`When I left on my journey, I abandoned the name of Ushiromiya Ange and stepped into a new life.`
`By now, things had settled down, but back when the Sumadera family was still a threat, I wanted to distance myself from that name.`
`......Thanks to that, no one was able to get in touch with the new "me" anymore.`
`However, this year, "Sakutarou's Great Adventure" had caught the public eye.`
` It had made the name of Kotobuki Yukari famous, ......and maybe that name had finally reached his ears.`
`I used to play with a lion stuffed animal called Sakutarou, along with Maria onee‐chan.`
`If those who knew this connected the name Sakutarou with the hint in my own name, ......then it's only natural that they'd figure out who I was.`
`The number of people who could recognize me from this was very, very limited.`
`.........This person was also well‐versed in detective novels, and a man.`
`I could only think of one person who matched.`
`After all, I had learned just how many detective novels he had kept piled up in his room......when going through his personal effects.`
`It was almost the time we had arranged for our meeting.`
`My heart was racing, ......almost like a girl in love for the first time......`
`At precisely the arranged time, I heard the sound of the chime on the door,`
` .........and {i:they} appeared.`
`It was a man sitting on a wheelchair...and a woman pushing him.`
`My eyes immediately fixed on the man in the wheelchair.`
`......And, right away, ......I saw the similarity in his face...`
`He was, unmistakably,`
` ...............my brother.`
`My brother, ......Ushiromiya Battler......`
`When our eyes met, he gave a little bow.`
` I hurried to my feet and bowed back.`
`......It was a somewhat exaggerated and silly way for a pair of siblings to greet each other after several decades apart.`
`......But the miracle I had waited for all these years had become a reality, ......and my mind was now completely blank.`
`"......Are you Kotobuki Yukari?"`
`"Yes, I am...`
` ......And you two must be...Hachijo Tohya."`
`"A pleasure to meet you.`
` Thank you very much for letting us borrow your precious time today.`
` ......My name is Hachijo Ikuko.`
` I am mostly in charge of the actual writing.`
` ......This is Tohya.`
` He mostly handles the drafting."`
`Though the woman who called herself Ikuko was far older than me, she seemed to be unbelievably youthful.`
`It wasn't because she was good with makeup or dressed like a younger woman.`
`It feels strange to say it...`
`There was a strange mystique about her, ......as though she was immortal and never‐aging.`
`Then, I quickly remembered that she had introduced my brother as Tohya.`
`"......Pardon me for asking, ......but are you two married?"`
`"We are not married, but we have been together for a long time."`
`"True. Looking back on it, it really has been a long time......"`
`My brother smiled as he spoke.`
`......When I learned that, at least for him, these long decades hadn't been a period of isolation and loneliness,`
` I felt an incredible sense of peace and relief.`
`I suddenly realized that he was staring into my face just as I had been staring into his.`
`After all, when he saw me last, I was just six years old.`
` It must be hard for him to find any traces he can recognize.`
`However, ......I'm sure he'll recognize something, just the same.`
`We kept stealing glances at each other and looking away, like a couple on a blind date.`
`We were both at an age where outside appearances mattered to us.`
` Even though we both knew, we couldn't let our polite exterior falter.`
`This humorous exchange was extremely embarrassing.`
`......I thought that when fate reunited two people like this, they would hold each other and sob tears of gratitude together.`
`However, it seemed that the reality of it was different......`
`But that's fine.`
`It feels like my heart will explode with happiness......`
`"Let's take our orders.`
` Is coffee okay?`
` What does everyone want?"`
`"I'd prefer something that isn't so bitter.`
` ......How about you, Miss Kotobuki?"`
`"Oh, ......I don't mind...`
` ...I guess I'll have café au lait......"`
`How stiff we're being.`
`Even my brother seemed to be finding it amusing by now.`
`".........Well, then."`
`When she said that, my brother and I fell silent and sat up straight.`
`"Should I start the conversation?`
` Or would you like to be the one to do it, Tohya?"`
`".........I'll do it.`
` I'm the one who pushed so hard for this meeting, after all."`
`As he spoke, he watched me calmly.`
`"I came here today......thinking that you might be a certain person.`
` Her name is Ushiromiya Ange.`
` ......When I read your works and heard your name, I was sure that you were her."`
`"That's right.`
` ......How long it's been since I last used that name.`
` My true name is Ushiromiya Ange......"`
`I gave the exaggerated bow that I'd gotten so used to these long years.`
`......We've both aged, haven't we, Onii‐chan?`
`I whispered this in my heart.`
`Now, it was my turn.`
`With a quick apology, I fished around in my handbag and took out a photo.`
`It was a picture from a trip I'd taken to an amusement park with Battler onii‐chan.`
`I had many other pictures of us having a good time, but this one had the best shot of his face.`
`I looked between him and the photo.`
`{n}There was no longer any room for doubt.`
`"......Mr. Tohya.`
` Your true name is..........Ushiromiya Battler......san, is it not......?"`
`The hands of the clock inside me stopped.`
`I wanted him to answer with a yes...`
`Even though I was already so sure, ......I was still about to burst with the tension.`
`And then, when that instant that seemed far too long ended, my brother answered.`
`"That's right."`
`".............................."`
`Unconsciously, I stared at my brother's face.`
`With unbelievable quickness, he'd acknowledged that he was Ushiromiya Battler.`
`......My eyes immediately filled and overflowed with tears...`
`I took out a handkerchief and wiped them away, but I couldn't hold them back...`
`Onii‐chan was alive after all...`
`So why didn't he come back to me right away?`
`If he had been there during my darkest days, how much it would have meant to me......`
`Normally, the thought would have made me curse my brother, but by now, even that emotion was softened.`
`Because, now that I was faced with the miracle of being reunited with Onii‐chan, ......everything I felt before now fell away with my tears.`
`At this moment, ......I was happy.`
`I wasn't all alone.`
`{n}That belief had kept me going for decades.`
`And, finally, .........I had been rewarded......`
`By now, I couldn't even stop my tears.`
`For some time, I continued to sob and sniffle...`
`Watching this, my brother hung his head apologetically.`
`......Why hadn't he come back to me sooner?`
`{n}It looked as though he was feeling regret for that.`
`But I was sure he must have had some sort of reason.`
`He had probably come here today to tell me about it and apologize.`
`Already, ......just by him introducing himself to me today, ......everything inside of me had been washed clean with tears.`
`"......I'm......sorry......`
` ......I must be......embarrassing you......"`
`"No.`
` It's only to be expected.`
` ......For several decades, you've been waiting all alone, believing that your family would return."`
`"I did believe......`
` .........I believed you would come home.........`
` .........Onii‐chan............"`
`I held out my hand weakly, ......and my brother slowly held his out too.`
`Then, ......I gripped his hand.`
`Regardless of how many long years had passed, .........it was, without a doubt, my brother's hand.`
`Once more, I had to struggle to hold back the tears......`
`"......Aunt Eva avoided the explosion accident by escaping to Kuwadorian.`
` ......How did you escape the accident, Onii‐cha—......nii‐san?"`
`"On that day, ......I escaped through the underground passage."`
`"The one that goes to Kuwadorian?"`
`"I was told that an underground passage led to a hidden mansion on the opposite side of the island.`
` ......However, the place we escaped to was a submarine base, not Kuwadorian."`
`I don't know under what circumstances my brother entered the underground passage on that day.`
`At any rate, he went into the underground passage, split up with Aunt Eva there, and escaped to the submarine base.`
`There, he escaped the explosion...and survived......`
`"From there, I got away on a motorboat.`
` ......However, ......it must have capsized somewhere along the way."`
`"It...must have...?"`
`"......Please forgive him.`
` Tohya suffers from memory loss.`
` His memory from around the time he was drowning in the ocean is hazy."`
`"Could it be......that he forgot he was Ushiromiya Battler for a while...?"`
`"That is correct."`
`......Yes, that explains nearly all of the riddles.`
`My brother escaped from the explosion, but either his boat capsized during his escape from the island, or he fell overboard.`
`Afterwards, he must have drifted somewhere, wandered about half‐conscious, and maybe got into a traffic accident...`
`"On that day, he was lying on the road."`
`"If she had found me even a little later, I probably wouldn't have opened my eyes again."`
`"I believe you suspected that I was the one who hit you for quite some time."`
`"Hey, I've already apologized for that......"`
`This explains pretty much everything.`
`Either because of the time he nearly drowned, or because of the traffic accident, my brother's memory was damaged.`
`His memory must have come back eventually.`
`However, by that time, I had already set foot into my new life as Kotobuki Yukari.`
`Only a handful of people, including President Okonogi, knew where I was.`
`Even if my brother tried to contact me, there was a very good chance that he wouldn't be able to.`
`.........Ironically, the name I had abandoned when I decided to live in the future...`
`had delayed my reunion with my brother for so long.`
`In that sense, I am responsible.`
` I did it to myself.`
`......However, I think I did receive the message that my brother sent me.`
`It was through Itouikukuro.`
`I realized that Itouikukuro, the Forger who claimed to have reached the truth, was actually Hachijo Tohya.`
`And I did request a meeting with her through the publishing company, to question her about why she was so sure she'd reached the truth.`
`However, I wasn't granted a meeting.`
`In the end, I heard nothing from them, and it's taken all these decades for me to meet Hachijo Tohya.`
`......If the publishing company had only passed my message on, we could have been reunited so much sooner.`
`However, at the time, I was just a bourgeois girl who liked to throw money around.`
`Why would they pass on my message when I just barged in with no introduction and demanded to meet the famous and popular Hachijo Tohya?`
`We probably crossed paths several times.`
`If just one of those had worked out, if we had been able to meet...`
`{n}......Just how much would my life have changed?`
`But this was fate.`
`God had decided that a few decades were needed before this sibling reunion.`
`And during that time, my brother became one half of a mystery novelist.`
` I became a writer of adventure novels for children.`
`You could say that we achieved success in society.`
`My brother and I were able to be reunited after becoming successful.`
`Now, I could do nothing but thank God for bringing about this miracle...`
`"Maybe it was God's will that we should be reunited after achieving success as novelists...`
` .........Back then, I was nameless, so I never got through to you.`
` We've met now because we've both become famous as authors...`
` ......I think all of this was God's will......"`
`"We did hear through the publishing company at the time that you wanted to have an interview with us.`
` .........They told us that a fan who had discovered Itouikukuro's true identity wanted to talk, and they asked us for a decision."`
`"......You must've had dozens of fans dying for an interview.`
` You couldn't possibly go to meet all of them..."`
`"No.`
` They let us know that your name was Ushiromiya Ange.`
` ......At the time, I had already realized that Tohya's true name was Ushiromiya Battler, so I thought you should be given a chance to meet him."`
`"I...refused."`
`Those were my brother's words.`
`".........What.........did you say......?"`
`"I refused......because I didn't want to meet you."`
`Once more, my brother spoke clearly.`
`I was completely confused.`
`I could only sit there in shock and silence, waiting for the words that were sure to follow...`
`"......I believe I already mentioned that Tohya suffered from memory loss.`
` ......And then, one day—"`
`"Why did you refuse, when you knew it was me...?"`
`I cut through Ikuko's words and questioned him directly.`
`What reason could my brother have for rejecting me?`
`{n}I couldn't think of anything.`
`That unpleasant feeling brought up long‐forgotten feelings of anger inside me...`
`"You must have known that your little sister was living all alone, being crushed by loneliness.`
` So why...... Why did you refuse to allow me to see you...?"`
`My brother hung his head.`
`It seemed more like he was lost for words than apologetic.`
`Unable to sense that he even felt any compunction about his actions, I questioned him again in an even louder voice.`
`When I asked for an appointment with Hachijo Tohya, Itouikukuro was already famous as a Forger.`
`Why did Itouikukuro's Forgeries reach the truth?`
`It's obvious.`
`My brother, Ushiromiya Battler, explained to her what happened on the island in detail.`
`So, the appearance of Itouikukuro proves that my brother's memory had returned.`
`Therefore, he can't excuse himself by saying that he didn't remember me.`
`In fact, no, ...he isn't trying to make excuses.`
`On the contrary, he's openly saying that he refused to meet me, even though he knew who I was.`
`".........Looking back, ...I regret what I did."`
`"You {i:regret} it...?!!`
` Did you ever try thinking about how I felt?!`
` For decades, ......for most of my life...!`
` Do you realize what feelings I had to live with......?"`
`Various emotions swirled inside of me.`
`{n}I realized that I wasn't in control of them anymore.`
`I could only moan, to prevent myself from saying something I'd regret...`
`"I feel deeply ashamed for doing something so cruel to you.`
` ......That's why I've searched for you ever since then.`
` For your sake and for mine, ......I should have met you much earlier..."`
`".........Then why.........wouldn't you meet me then.........?"`
`"......Miss Kotobuki.`
` ......As I said before, ......his memory has been damaged.`
` It was an aftereffect of the accident."`
`"But his memory came back, didn't it......?!"`
`"......Yes, his memory came back.`
` However, that did not remove the aftereffects of the damage."`
`"I have Ushiromiya Battler's memories.`
` ......However, I can't think of those......can't accept those......as my own."`
`"............Can't think of those.........as your own......?"`
`"......Yes.`
` ......It's true that my memory of my escape from the island is still hazy.`
` However, I've remembered almost everything else."`
`".........Things like how those pink hair ornaments of yours that you treasured so much...were something I won for you at the game corner in that amusement park."`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` They're a treasure from when I was a child.`
` ......I still keep them with me in my handbag..."`
`"I remember a lot more besides that.`
` ......I remember you giving Mother trouble because you hated eating seaweed.`
` I remember that you tried to move it to my plate and trick her.`
` ......And when—"`
`"If you remember that much, .........then why can't you think of those memories as your own...?"`
`"...............That is......the condition I live with.`
` ......I've been to several hospitals, but it didn't do any good.`
` ......You probably can't understand it.`
` You can't know how painful it is to have your mind suddenly fill with the memories of a man you don't know..."`
`It was a terrifying feeling of losing his own identity.`
`The memories of a stranger filled his head, and they threatened to crush and overwhelm him.`
`They were almost certainly his own lost memories.`
`However, .........his brain couldn't accept them as his own.`
`"Those days were painful, terrifying.`
` .........It felt like my mind was being invaded...`
` ............On any given night, after I turned off the lights and went to sleep, maybe "I" would never wake up again.`
` Maybe a different man would wake up the following morning and start living life in my body.`
` ......I can't count the nights that I spent tormented by this fear..."`
`".........He tried several times to convince himself that they were his real memories.`
` ......He told himself that he was Ushiromiya Battler over and over again."`
`"But...nothing worked.`
` ......I am me, ...Hachijo Tohya.`
` ......No matter how much Ushiromiya Battler's memories flow into my mind.`
` ......To me, they're the memories of another person.`
` .........I couldn't accept Ushiromiya Battler........."`
`......As "Ushiromiya Battler" said this, ......he hung his head as his eyes turned red.`
`"............And one day, out of the anguish of being torn between himself and the other self he couldn't accept, in a fit, he............"`
`".........................................."`
`"He was fortunate enough to survive the ordeal, but the injuries he sustained then forced him to spend his life in a wheelchair..."`
`".........How......terrible......"`
`Now I see why he appeared in that wheelchair.`
`And, ......now I know why he refused to meet with me......`
`He was afraid......of me calling him "big brother".`
`He was terrified of meeting me, fearful that the part of himself that wasn't him would grow still further in his mind.`
`"Even so, he fought.`
` .........He felt that, since Ushiromiya Battler was inside him, it was his responsibility to meet you.`
` Thinking that, ......he kept on fighting in the space between his two selves."`
`And then, .........in a fit, he............`
`......After something like that, it was only natural that Ikuko would tell him that he didn't need to remember Ushiromiya Battler anymore.`
`Bit by bit, he tried to forget that he was once "Ushiromiya Battler".`
`Doctor's instructions and medication.`
` With that and Ikuko's diligent care, ......he slowly began to regain his peace of mind......`
`"Even so,`
` .........I...`
`thought that I would have to meet you sooner or later.`
` ......To be honest, I didn't get a wink of sleep last night.`
` .........I was...terrified of meeting you......"`
`"............................................."`
`"If I met you, would I die?`
` ......I was afraid that I would.`
` ......However, here I am, talking to you normally."`
`"......That's why I regret what I did.`
` .........If only.........I could have............met with you earlier......`
` ......You......and the Ushiromiya Battler inside of me.........might not have had to suffer for all those years...`
` ......Just thinking that makes me feel so......sorry.................. ............"`
`As the man who was once Ushiromiya Battler said this, he broke down crying.`
`......I was already......beginning to understand.`
`It really......{i:was} true.`
`{n}Ushiromiya Battler............did die that day.`
`After all, .........didn't the witches say that he was dead so often with the red truth...?`
`.........How pathetic for the Witch of the Future......the Witch of Resurrection......who swore that everyone would be together always......`
`..........................................`
`"......Tohya‐san.`
` Please, raise your head."`
`"............M‐......Miss Kotobuki......"`
`They realized why I had called him Tohya‐san.`
`And by calling {i:this man} by that name, ......I myself felt the agitation in my heart subside a little.`
`"Thank you.`
` .........You must have suffered a lot.`
` ......Thank you so much, Mr. Tohya......"`
`"......Uugh.........uuuuuughhhgh..............uuuu......"`
`".........Thank you,`
` nii‐san.`
` .........Thanks......for pushing yourself so hard to come here today............"`
`Holding hands, ......we brought our foreheads close and cried together for a while.`
`Then, we talked of the old days.`
`He remembered many things vividly, even things that I couldn't remember myself.`
`Each time, they made me cry even harder, and he hung his head apologetically.`
`And once I realized that my tears were hurting him, I just did my best to let him speak, nodding along with a strange look on my face, something between a sob and a smile.`
`.........Even if he isn't Ushiromiya Battler.`
`{n}My Onii‐chan came back to me...`
`Welcome home,`
` .........Onii‐chan.........`
`It had already gotten dark outside.`
`Even though he had come from far away, he was willing to stay as late as this.`
`We left the store.`
`It's probably best......if I don't meet with Mr. Tohya again.`
`It will cause him pain, ......and of course, I'll find myself bound to the past again.`
`Even so, just one more time.`
`{n}There was one place I felt I had to show him.`
`"......Mr. Tohya.`
` ......Would you mind meeting with me just one last time?`
` There's a place I feel I need to show you."`
`".....................`
` ......Sure, I don't mind."`
`From my handbag, I pulled an invitation, which had been printed on a sheet of A4 paper and folded into four.`
`The pair of them unfolded it.`
`"My.`
` Now this looks like a splendid event."`
`".........Come to think of it, you have been involved in a lot of things besides novels, haven't you?"`
`"On that day, would you lend me your time just once more?`
` ......That way, I think both me and my brother will be satisfied.`
` I think...it might also be a chance for you to free yourself from the weight of my brother's memory, Mr. Tohya."`
`"......I......don't believe we have any plans for then.`
` As long as we can get the afterword for the book finished ahead of time."`
`"Okay, Miss Kotobuki.`
` ......We'd be happy to join you."`
`"Thank you, Mr. Tohya........."`
`The cold, October night was a reminder that winter was approaching.`
`......The two people who called themselves Hachijo Tohya visited the city once again by Ange's invitation.`
`A car stopped in front of a large building.`
`Ikuko unfolded the wheelchair with a practiced hand, lent a shoulder to Tohya as he got out of the passenger's seat, and helped him into the chair.`
`".........It looks splendid."`
`"The Gospel House.`
` ......It's my first time coming here, ......but I know it well.`
` I believe it's the institution for children that was funded by the Ushiromiya family."`
`"Madam Ikuko, Mr. Tohya.`
` Allow us to welcome you to the Gospel House."`
`They were welcomed by Ange and some staff members.`
`This was...the Gospel House.`
`A welfare institution for unfortunate children who had lost their parents.`
`This institution was once dependent on the support it received from Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
`However, that support had been interrupted, and the Gospel House had been forced to shut down for a time.`
`Decades had passed.`
` And now, the institution would be revived.`
`Revived by the hand of Kotobuki Yukari.`
`"......It's a pleasure to see you again, Miss Kotobuki.`
` Thank you for your invitation.`
` ......This is from the two of us.`
` It's not much, but I hope the children enjoy it."`
`"That was never the intention behind inviting you here......`
` I feel terrible accepting this......"`
`"Please don't let it concern you.`
` ......The tales of the future are always woven by children.`
` ......After all, without them, the tale of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s will not continue."`
`"Children are treasures.`
` So please, let this be useful."`
`"......Thank you very much.`
` ......We have a form for donations, so if it isn't too much trouble......"`
`The Gospel House had been drastically remodeled in recent years.`
`In the hopes that children would one day be able to remember this as a fun place...`
`Ange had used her own money to massively remodel it into a beautiful establishment.`
`......By now, she had accumulated a lot of wealth as a novelist,`
` but even without that, she had been saving the tens of millions of yen she got from the Ushiromiya Group each year under the name of living expenses.`
`This money had been used generously to help the children.`
`When they came into the entrance hall, a cheerful scene was spread before them.`
`Pictures and crafts created by the children.`
` ......Every corner was filled with things on display.`
`The contrast between this elegant building and the school atmosphere was amusing.`
`The yells and laughter of kids running around drifted in from the distance.`
`".........I imagine that many children first come here hanging their heads in sorrow.`
` To think that they could be here laughing like that......... You really have done something great."`
`"All people can use magic to create their future and find a fragment of happiness.`
` ......This is a witch's school for teaching that magic."`
`"The "Witch's Dormitory" from "Sakutarou's Great Adventure"?"`
`"......Oh, how embarrassing.`
` ......So you've read it too..."`
`"We read straight through it right after our last meeting.`
` ......I really must bow my head, not only to your talent as a writer, but to your warm heart."`
`"How embarrassing......`
` .........This way, straight to the end."`
`Pushing Tohya's wheelchair, we advanced through the corridor and reached the great doors at the end.`
`The happy voices of children came from the other side.`
`Apparently, this was where tonight's party was being held.`
`There were several jack‐o‐lanterns cut out of origami.`
`Tonight...was the Gospel House's Halloween party.`
`"Here you are, Mr. Tohya."`
`"I see, so it's trick‐or‐treat."`
`He was handed a bag filled with candy.`
`A teacher warned him in a small voice...`
`to watch out for rampaging children.`
`"......Children.`
` I haven't had anything to do with them for years."`
`"Please tell the children stories of dreams.`
` We all welcome guests here......"`
`"That's tricky...`
` What should I tell them?"`
`"‘When you're handing in your manuscript, choose your publishing company wisely’?"`
`"‘Don't pay any attention to reader polls.’"`
`"*giggle*giggle*.`
` Then I'll open the doors.`
` The children are waiting."`
`Ange opened the large double doors......`
`"This......place..........................."`
`At the sight of the hall......Tohya opened his mouth in wide‐eyed shock.`
`This was...the great hall of the Ushiromiya mansion.`
`No, that would be impossible......`
`They were clearly in the Gospel House.`
`This hall.........was an exact look‐alike of the one in the Rokkenjima mansion...............`
`"......What a splendid hall."`
`"This is......a replica......of the hall in the Ushiromiya mansion.........on Rokkenjima......"`
`"Yes.`
` ......I've reproduced it as well as my memory would let me.`
` The details might be wrong though."`
`"......No.`
` .........This really is.........the hall of the Ushiromiya family mansion......on that day......"`
`And then, Tohya's eyes fixed......on something at the other side of the room.`
`It was.........a portrait.`
`{n}A portrait of Rokkenjima's other master.`
`"......It's.........exactly the same as my memories........."`
`"The artist hired by Ushiromiya Kinzo to paint the portrait had a photo.`
` ......I had him draw it again based on that."`
`".........................................."`
`I was simply frozen in shock.`
`The long, large table was filled with Halloween party food and surrounded with children stuffing themselves.`
`The teacher said "everyone, we have guests".`
`......The children all looked at us at once, ......then stood up and ran forward......`
`Their broad smiles at the arrival of this long‐awaited guest wrapped me up.`
`The smiles and eyes of the children.........welcomed me.`
`Yeah, .........I know.`
` ......I know......all your faces.........`
`It's been so long, far too long...... I'm finally here, at last......`
