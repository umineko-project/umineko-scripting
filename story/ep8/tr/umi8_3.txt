`The VIP room was filled with the sweet smell of pumpkin tea...`
`and packed with smiles and laughter.`
`"Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha!!`
` Simply splendid.`
` I am glad to see you in such high spirits...!"`
`"I could say the same for you.`
` What idiot said you're reaching your last years?"`
`"I just borrow a bit of cheer from you.`
` Once I return to my study, I will be little more than a withering, senile old man."`
`"Enough with your lies!`
` Give it up and swear that you'll be living it large until you're a hundred."`
`"Same here. I haven't seen you for six years, but I was surprised to see how little you'd changed."`
`"Wahahahaha, you little brat.`
` So, it seems you've learned flattery these past six years!`
` Sorry to disappoint you, but you're hardly a fair judge in the matter.`
` I have grown quite old indeed."`
`"I'll bet a thousand yen that Kinzo's still doing great when he turns a hundred."`
`"Yeah, me too.`
` Grandfather won't be any different when he's a hundred."`
`"Wahhahahaha!`
` Don't think you'll get any more presents for complimenting me!"`
`Kinzo laughed cheerily.`
`{n}Beato, who sat next to Battler, was also laughing merrily.`
`Ange stood all alone by the window,`
` ......staring at the others and trying to figure out what sort of relationship the witch of the portrait had with her grandfather.`
`There was a knock on the door.`
`"Is that you, Genji?`
` Come in!"`
`"......Pardon the intrusion.`
` Krauss‐sama and Natsuhi‐sama are here."`
`"Father—oh, and Battler‐kun's here too."`
`"It has been some time, {f:5:Beatrice}‐san.`
` Has there been any news?"`
`"I'm just the way I used to be.`
` Come, have a seat.`
` And Ange, why are you standing by the window like that?`
` Come over here and sit down."`
`"Ange. Come on over."`
`".........I'll just watch from here."`
`Ange grasped the candy she had gotten from Beato tightly,`
` and with a still wary gaze, she continued to stare.`
`Genji offered her a chair, but Ange just shook her head.`
`"Let her do as she pleases.`
` Come, Krauss, Natsuhi, and sit."`
`"......Is it something important?`
` I guess Ange and I should leave."`
`"Hey, if you leave, who's going to back me up here...?!`
` Kinzo, you don't mind if Battler stays, do you?"`
`"I have nothing to hide.`
` I do not mind."`
`However, he had called Krauss and Natsuhi to the VIP room to meet {f:5:Beatrice}, the Golden Witch.`
`It was hard to imagine that Kinzo wanted to have a casual conversation......`
`After Kinzo said he didn't mind, Beato also asked Battler to stay, so he decided to do so.`
`In order to avoid getting in the way of their conversation, Battler stood up from the sofa and walked over to Ange's window.`
`When the big brother finally came back to Ange, she clung to his waist, as though determined not to let him go away again.`
`"Oh, I see.`
` That must be why Ange doesn't like me."`
`"Huh? What do you mean?`
` I don't really think she dislikes you."`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` You never could understand women, Battler."`
`Beato smiled at Ange, but the latter turned to look the other way...`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Even a young woman is a woman nonetheless."`
`When Beato stopped laughing, the conversation switched gears.`
`Why on Earth did Kinzo summon Krauss and Natsuhi to the VIP room, and what was he going to talk about?`
` Everyone fell automatically silent.`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}, Golden Witch.`
` Each and every day, I remember the debt owed by the Ushiromiya family for the time it was saved on the brink of destruction."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Yeah, you'd better thank me."`
`"Well, it's actually your grandmother he's thanking."`
`"Shut up, you."`
`"No, it comes to the same thing.`
` All of that gold has been lent to the Ushiromiya family for three generations.`
` And for no compensation."`
`"......We truly...cannot be grateful enough."`
`"Gold is no more than a pile of bricks to me.`
` It was a relief to have Kinzo hold onto it, since I had nowhere to put them."`
`"Whoa.`
` I'd like to say that just once before I die."`
`".........Is the Golden Witch...a rich person...?"`
`"Hmm?`
` Well, yeah.`
` After all, she just went and lent Grandfather ten tons of gold."`
`"Precisely.`
` I've been borrowing it for several decades, always promising to return it someday.`
` The debt of gratitude I owe for that favor is now far beyond my ability to repay."`
`"The head family has never forgotten its gratitude.`
` Isn't that right, dear?"`
`"Of course.`
` If the {f:5:Beatrice}s hadn't so generously lent it to us for three generations,`
` the Ushiromiya family would have fallen long ago.`
` Even someone as shrewd as Father couldn't do anything without funds to start with."`
`"By now, my money is making money, and the gold that made up my original funds can sleep in peace.`
` .........Krauss.`
` Do you know what I am about to say?"`
`Since the moment Krauss had been summoned here, he had guessed about the things Kinzo's words now hinted at.`
`All things borrowed must someday be returned.`
` That day had finally come.`
`"......Yes, I understand.`
` Father."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I do not have many years ahead of me.`
` In fact,`
` ......this may be the last family conference that we will attend together."`
`"How fainthearted you sound.`
` You must be joking."`
`Beato alone laughed.`
`She looked at Battler, so he laughed along with her, but Kinzo and the others remained silent.`
`Apparently, there existed some major concerns about Kinzo's health......`
`"Of course, I do not intend to die as soon as next year.`
` However, I don't believe I can make any certain promises about meeting you again next year.`
` Not once have I ever made a promise that I cannot keep."`
`"If you say it so proudly like that, I'm in no position to disagree.`
` ......Are you serious about this?"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I want to make amends.`
` And I must do it while I still have the energy.`
` For that reason, I made the decision to do it today."`
`".........What's Grandfather talking about...?"`
`"Quiet.`
` .........Grandfather is......about to talk about something very important."`
`By now, even Battler understood what Kinzo was about to propose.`
`Beato probably realized it too...`
`At one time, the Ushiromiya family had ruled the skies like an eagle...before being crushed in the Great Kanto Earthquake.`
`The eagle had one of its wings torn off, and it crawled in the mud, on the point of death.`
`Then, they were saved by the Golden Witch's golden miracle.`
`{n}Under the Golden Witch's protection, the eagle had nursed its wounds for many years.`
`And now, finally, it was time for the eagle to leave the nest the witch had provided......`
`"All of the gold that your grandmother lent me,`
` I will return to you.`
` .........Krauss, you have no objections, correct?`
` That gold did not belong to the Ushiromiya family in the first place."`
`"Of course.`
` I have no objections whatsoever."`
`"Are you sure, Krauss?`
` You're an investor, aren't you?`
` You could always do with more money, right?`
` Didn't you want Kinzo to hand the gold over to you?"`
`"Hahahaha...`
` Yes, now that you mention it, it's hard to deny what you say.`
` However, the contract was always between you and Father, and the gold was yours to begin with."`
`"After all, my husband is the successor.`
` Just as Father rebuilt the family in one generation,`
` I am sure my husband will make the family thrive in his.`
` And this is something the two of us will do together."`
`"Hmm, well said.`
` That's the spirit."`
`"......So, you have no regrets in leaving behind ten tons of gold.`
` I must say, that is quite impressive.`
` What can a witch do against an opponent who cannot be swayed by the golden magic?"`
`"I will return the gold to you.`
` However, that will not change the fact that the Ushiromiya family will always be supremely indebted to {f:5:Beatrice}, the Golden Witch."`
`"......................................."`
`To return the gold once lent by the Golden Witch.`
` It was both simple and clear.`
`However, the expression worn by the Golden Witch herself was slightly lonely.`
`Ange couldn't understand why this was.`
`".........I can hardly refuse what is being returned to me.`
` Ah, well."`
`Beato rose from the sofa.`
`Then, she walked up to the window and looked down at the rose garden waving in the wind.`
`"Krauss.`
` I have also decided to present you and the others with my inheritance while I still live."`
`"F‐Father......"`
`"When I die, you will not only be busy with the funeral, but I imagine that you will have Eva and the others at your throats over the inheritance issue.`
` If all is divided now, the funeral will be less trying for you.`
`......Krauss, write this down.`
` And Genji, please be our secretary.`
` I will now lay out the distribution of my assets."`
`Kinzo immediately began explaining how the inheritance would be split up.`
`Battler, realizing that he shouldn't be listening in on this conversation,`
` walked over to where Beato was loitering by the window...`
`"Hey, rich person.`
` If you've got too much gold on your hands, I'd be happy to lighten the load."`
`"Gold...would be no less useful if you turned it to firewood and used it to cook a stew."`
`"What's the matter?`
` You're looking a bit miserable."`
`"So, this day has finally come.`
` .........I do feel a bit lonely."`
`".........You do?"`
`"My magic revived the Ushiromiya family and created Rokkenjima.`
` ......And now, it seems the Ushiromiya family no longer has any need for the power of my gold.`
` It has taken flight, leaving the nest of my magic behind."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......That's pretty much it."`
`"I have called Rokkenjima the witch's island—`
`my island."`
`".........Yeah."`
`"And now, Rokkenjima is returning the gold to me.`
` .........The day has come...for Rokkenjima to awaken from my magic."`
`"...........................`
` ......I guess it has."`
`"I...knew that this would be the last game.`
` ......However, for that subject to be broached, even in a manner such as this, .........is surprisingly hard to handle."`
`"You're the type of person who looks totally carefree, but who's actually full of lingering attachments and regrets."`
`"The cruel and obstinate ones are usually the quickest to grow attached...and then to feel lonely."`
`"That's right.`
` That's the kind of person you are."`
`"............It was...a game for you and me."`
`"It was fun.`
` It's a game you polished to perfection during those six years..."`
`"I once likened it to an eternal torture for the both of us."`
`"......Eternity...is happiest when you can still believe that it's eternity.`
` But all things must end.`
` And we have to be aware of that."`
`"So, we must not avert our eyes."`
`"Just as the sun always rises,`
` there's no sun that doesn't set."`
`"................................."`
`Of course, Ange didn't have the slightest idea what her brother and the witch were talking about.`
`......However, even as young as she was, she could feel that the pair had spent an incredibly long time together...`
`and that they understood each other so well that they might as well be a married couple...`
`Then,`
` Beato noticed her reaction.`
`".........Ange.`
` At one point, the two of us wove games for each other.`
` However, that time is already over.`
` This game has been made, not for our sake, but for yours."`
`They were talking in riddles again.`
`{n}Grasping the key that hung by her chest, Ange looked at her brother's face...`
`"We need to show you the contents of the cat box that is this day.`
` ......That key I gave you is for opening it."`
`"............What do you mean......cat box...?"`
`"He means this day."`
`"You wanted to reach this day so much.`
` Using the miracle of magic, I've brought you here.`
` .........You must continue telling the story of this day, as the final witch."`
`"Does that mean............that I mustn't remain here...?"`
`Ange's tone was slightly tense.`
`{n}She understood what her brother meant, and it made her frown.`
`"Just how long have I suffered, wishing that I could return to the Rokkenjima of 1986...`
` And now, I finally made it here!`
` So why are you chasing me out...?!`
` You said I could decide for myself!"`
`"That's right.`
` I did say that."`
`"I'm not leaving.`
` And please, stop trying to spoil me with this strange, made‐up tale...!`
` I want to know the truth of this day!!"`
`"She is a moody kid, be it twelve years in the future or twelve years in the past."`
`"Shut up. I didn't ask you...!`
` And what the hell do you think you're doing...?!`
` Didn't the Golden Witch come here to perform her resurrection ritual?!"`
`"Didn't you appear on the island with a crash of thunder and try to offer up thirteen people as sacrifices?!`
` Why are you acting so happy and casual?!`
` It doesn't make sense!"`
`"You're the one that doesn't make sense.`
` What are you thinking?`
` Do you want me to be a murderer?"`
`"You wrote tales about it, sealed them in message bottles, and threw them into the sea!`
` Two of them were discovered later on...!`
` Both of them were stories of cruel serial murders!"`
`"What a shame that only two of them made it to shore...!`
` How sad that "Land", my greatest masterpiece, was never seen by human eyes."`
`"I've been wanting to ask this for a while, but what's up with those message bottles?"`
`"As I was working out the details for my game against you, I began creating those tales along the way.`
` Once I realized that I could create endless different tales out of the same game board, it really started to get fun...!"`
`"So, you wrote them down, hoping that I would read them someday."`
`"Precisely!`
` They were so good, I just couldn't bear to wait for your return...!`
` Inspired by those classic works set on isolated islands, I tried sealing them in bottles and throwing them into the ocean.`
` Mysterious, don't you think?!"`
`"Don't mock me...!!!`
` Those were your plans for the crime!`
` You used the location of the hidden gold to fan up discontent between the family members...`
`as you planned your brutal serial murders...!!"`
`"Sheesh,`
` is that how I've become in the year 1998?`
` ......Well, I guess I can't blame them, *cackle*cackle*."`
`"Huh?!`
` What's with the sudden change of character...?!!`
` Is this some scheme to make me let my guard down?!`
` I'm not gonna be fooled, {f:5:Beatrice}! Onii‐chan!!"`
`"You want to make me surrender and say that witches exist, don't you?!`
` You think I'll fall for that...?!`
` I'll find the truth without your help!"`
`"Even though that truth is all around you right now?`
` You once called yourself Gretel, but it seems the name Mytyl would be more fitting."`
`"Enough!!!"`
`Ange tried to slap Beato's cheek.`
`However, the difference between their heights was so great that Beato dodged before the hand could reach her.`
`"Stupid......`
` Stupid......!`
` I won't acknowledge it...`
` I'll never.........acknowledge this farce as the truth...!!"`
`After Ange yelled those words, her eyes grew cloudy.`
`They cleared up almost immediately.`
` By that time, she had already gone back to her six‐year‐old self...`
`"............You're right, Ange.`
` This is the sin I left behind, ...and the reason for this final tale's existence."`
`"...........................?"`
`As Ange stared blankly, uncomprehending, Beato gently patted her head.`
`"Indeed.`
` This tale is a farce.`
` It could not be true.`
` ......Yet, he was prepared to look past that—`
`no, to make it that way on purpose—`
`for the sake of the message that he wants to convey to you."`
`"Beato.`
` I'm already showing it to her.`
` I don't want to force it on her."`
`"I see."`
`"...............I don't understand what you two are talking about.`
` .........I'm sleepy."`
`"You're right.`
` We should probably be going."`
`"Kinzo.`
` Must I remain here longer?"`
`"My apologies, but I must ask you to stay a little longer.`
` ......Moving on, Krauss,`
` the continued support of the Gospel House should be viewed as your responsibility as the Ushiromiya family head..."`
`"......What a pain.`
` Forgive me, Battler.`
` It seems I cannot go with you.`
` ......Genji.`
` Would you mind taking these two to the guesthouse?"`
`"As you wish.`
` ......Battler‐sama, Ange‐sama, please follow me."`
`"Thanks.`
` ......Okay, Beato.`
` I'll see you later."`
`"Of course!`
` I have a mountain of things I wish to discuss with you.`
` And I'd like us to have some time alone tonight.`
` We must act the part of a couple every now and then...!"`
`"Wh‐what do you mean, act the part of a couple?`
` Ihihi...!"`
`Because Ange had gotten so bored, she had grown very sleepy.`
`It would probably be best for her to take a quick nap.`
`Battler walked through the windy rose garden, pulling her by the hand.`
`When he questioned their guide, Genji, ......he learned that the old servant had known beforehand of Kinzo's desire to return the gold to Beato...`
`and settle the inheritance problem early.`
`"......The Master decided to start preparations early for his final task in this world, the ending of his life."`
`"Most people don't think much about what happens after they die...`
` ......Haah.`
` Guess Grandfather's just on a whole different scale."`
`"Today marks the day of a new flight, when the Ushiromiya family will depart from the Golden Witch's patronage."`
`".........That's true.`
` Heheh, that's a pretty cool way to say it."`
`Apparently, a grand Halloween party was to be held tonight,`
` and Gohda and the others had been ordered to start getting ready for it.`
`However, it wouldn't just be a party.`
`It would be a ceremony to mark the return of {f:5:Beatrice}'s gold.`
`At the start of dinner, Grandfather would make the announcement,`
` and the Ushiromiya family would give thanks and applause to the three generations of {f:5:Beatrice}s for their generosity over the years.`
`Apparently, this was what he had planned.`
`"Is this still being kept secret from Dad and the others?"`
`"Technically, it is a secret.`
` ......However, the Master did not suddenly begin thinking in this way today.`
` He has often considered this day for many years, and has even discussed certain matters with his children.`
` I doubt that any will be surprised to hear this night's announcement."`
`"Well, as for my old bastard,`
` he's been running all over the place trying to get money for his company.`
` I guess he'll be dancing with joy when he hears that he's gonna get to unwrap Grandfather's inheritance present early."`
`"I rather think that Rudolf‐sama will be galvanized by a sense of great responsibility.`
` ......He has succeeded splendidly since he left the island.`
` However, his success so far has been supported by the Master's wealth."`
`"......And now that he's suddenly getting his inheritance money, he'll have to keep going by his own strength alone in the future.`
` .........Heheh, in fact, it might actually put pressure on him."`
`"The siblings must have suffered for decades because of their father's excess of success and ability.`
` ......Simply having a parent who is too successful can be a great burden to a child."`
`"And tonight,`
` ......they'll be leaving the nest, truly becoming adults for the first time."`
`"It seems the Master plans to call this night a ceremony to return the gold.`
` ......However, he first intended to call it a living funeral."`
`"Sounds pretty depressing, having a funeral while you're still alive.`
` I'll admit that calling it a day of a new journey and leaving the nest fits the Ushiromiya family much better."`
`"...............Onii‐chan, ......I'm sleepy......"`
`"Look, we're almost to the guesthouse.`
` Do you want to go to Mom's room?`
` Or to the cousins' room?"`
`"I don't care......`
` ......I'll............sleep until dinner......"`
`Ange, still holding her brother's hand, crouched down and looked as though she was about to fall asleep.`
`Battler lifted her onto his back and carried her.`
`As she felt the warmth and safety of her brother's back, Ange drifted off into sleep......`
`What happened that day......?`
`Just what on Earth happened on October 4th and 5th, 1986?`
`Because of the massive size of the Rokkenjima Explosion Accident, the time the explosion occurred was known almost exactly, down to the minute.`
`The time was...`
`...the stroke of midnight on October 5th.`
`The sheer improbability of that time proved that the explosion was produced by artificial means.`
`Later on, the following statements were collected from individuals who knew Ushiromiya Kinzo when he was alive.`
`During his lifetime, Ushiromiya Kinzo built a clock rigged to blow up the island at exactly midnight.`
`This clock was apparently inside his secret study.`
` When he felt mentally cornered and wanted to think up a brilliant plan,`
` he would activate that device and use the tension of the approaching midnight to bring some flash of inspiration to him.`
`While Ushiromiya Kinzo still lived, this was only thought of as a tall tale about this eccentric man,`
` ......but the fact that the Rokkenjima Explosion Accident occurred at exactly midnight supported the story...`
`"......It sounds crazy."`
`"He must have hoped to gain some sort of mystical power from those short periods of madness.`
` If we think of it as being his source of high‐output mental power, the story isn't that difficult to swallow."`
`Professor Ootsuki spoke passionately.`
`Witch Hunters.`
`{n}Enthusiasts who treat the mad fantasy surrounding Rokkenjima as their plaything.`
`Ange had no reason to love these people, who embellished the deaths of her family just for the fun of it.`
`And yet, how ironic it was for Ange, who wanted to know what happened that day,`
` that these people were the ones who knew most about that island.`
`"If someone used that device, the island would be blown away without a trace.`
` ......There would be nothing left.`
` No matter what had happened there, they could erase it."`
`"Theories that Ushiromiya Eva masterminded some kind of plot sprang up very early on.`
` However, no one was able to explain how she set off such a massive explosion."`
`"And the rigged clock proves that such a thing was possible..."`
`"Correct.`
` We can theorize that Ushiromiya Eva, fully aware of the timing and radius of the explosion, took refuge in Kuwadorian."`
`"......To get all of the family wealth to herself,`
` she killed everyone, and used the explosion to remove all evidence..."`
`"That idea gives the most logical explanation for the Rokkenjima mystery.`
` It also conforms with the fact that Eva never spoke to anyone about the events of that day."`
`Where was that rigged clock, and how did Eva find it?`
`Several Forgeries have speculated on this matter.`
` There's no need for me to waste time thinking about it.`
`Eva activated the clock device, hid in Kuwadorian to escape the blast,`
` and was therefore the only one to survive.`
`That was everything, the answer, which eloquently told the whole story.`
`......When Eva first adopted me,`
` our relationship wasn't as bad as it later became.`
`I asked her several times:`
` What happened that day?`
`Every single time she answered, it was to say that she didn't remember.`
`But...well, she must have been flustered at the time.`
`{n}The very first time I asked, she answered like this:`
`"I can't tell you about it."`
`It was a slip of the tongue.`
` She knew what had happened that day.`
`And she left this world without telling even a bit of the truth.`
`She sealed the truth in a cat box...`
`and left this world, taking the key with her.`
`There can be only one answer.`
`She was behind everything.`
`{n}She got all of the family wealth to herself and became super‐rich.`
`And afterward, she lamented the fact that her beloved son would never inherit any of what she had created, ...and she cursed me.`
`......Just remembering that old bitch makes me want to vomit.`
`What happened that day?`
` That's what I want to know.`
`It's my only goal, the one reason I'm still alive.`
`However, later on, I had to come to grips with the fact that my goal was an abstract one.`
`After all, even if I don't know what happened that day...`
`As for {i:who} did the crime—the whodunit—`
`that is already clear.`
`Ushiromiya Eva.`
` She's the culprit.`
`That has never changed since the beginning.`
`Yes.`
` I'm not trying to find out what happened that day.`
`I'm trying to find out what Ushiromiya Eva did that day.`
`If I can reveal that, then I can expose Eva's evil, even though she has already died.`
`That...is my true goal.`
`The police also suspected that a crime might have taken place, and they did investigate.`
`However, no matter how much they inspected the crater that had once been Rokkenjima, they didn't find anything at all.`
`The public and the Witch Hunters cornered Eva with several pieces of circumstantial evidence, but they were unable to find a single piece of physical evidence...`
`...and so, though Eva was only the merest fraction of a shade away from guilty, they were unable to expose her crime......`
`My goal isn't anything as vague as learning what happened that day......`
`It's to expose the crime Ushiromiya Eva committed that day...and to have my revenge.`
`I can't expose Ushiromiya Eva's crime, so people are treating the events on the island as though some bizarre Golden Witch did it all.`
`Defeating the Golden Witch means exposing Ushiromiya Eva's crime for what it was.`
`I won't forgive Ushiromiya Eva.`
`{n}I swear...... I swear............`
`{n}I will hate her and take revenge for my family.`
`That is Ushiromiya Ange's one and only reason for living......`
`"Hahhahahaha.`
` If she knew she was hated that much, the president'd probably be rolling around laughing in the next world."`
`"......Shut up.`
` I'll expose that old bitch's crime.`
` ......I'll never accept that she blew all the evidence away and committed the perfect crime. I refuse."`
`"In other words, this journey of yours is a journey to take revenge for your family."`
`"Got a problem with that?"`
`"You must be joking.`
` It's great to know that you have a purpose in life."`
`"......Could you turn that off?"`
`"Oh?`
` You don't like M.Zakky?"`
`Amakusa turned the radio off.`
`The dull sound of the engine became the BGM that filled the car.`
`"Is there something strange about it?`
` A fight for revenge."`
`"Not really.`
` I've met people who live for that reason many times on the front."`
`"......You've been on battlefields many times as a mercenary, right?"`
`"Well, I've seen a few."`
`"So, are people who fight to take revenge for their families...`
`strong?"`
`"No doubt about it.`
` ......Some people'll even strap bombs to themselves and commit suicide to take revenge for their families.`
` Humans are more than capable of dying for vengeance."`
`"......That's right.`
` I could do it too."`
`"Have you heard of child soldiers?"`
`"You mean kids who fight like soldiers?"`
`"That's it.`
` Kids who've lost their parents and have nowhere to go sometimes get picked up by groups of armed insurgents and become soldiers.`
` ......They get a gun thrust in their hands, and they're taught how to take revenge.`
` ......But in the end, children are expendable.`
` Anyone can be a soldier in a battlefield if they can pull a trigger."`
`"Are you trying to say that I'm like that?"`
`"Revenge can be a reason for living.`
` It can also give you the strength to become a soldier.`
` ......Like a miracle, it can turn a girl who could do nothing but sob over her parents' corpses into a soldier, almost overnight.`
` ......Nothing gives you more power than revenge does."`
`"I guess so.`
` And that's what I'm like."`
`"Do you know about the child soldier problem?"`
`"No."`
`"Child soldiers who are given guns and taught how to take revenge make that their reason for living.`
` Well, that's not exactly right.`
` It becomes their reason for shooting their guns.`
` ............But revenge is something that never ends.`
` At some point, they no longer have any reason for shooting their guns."`
`"......What do you mean?"`
`"They used to shoot for revenge.`
` But, eventually, they keep on shooting for no reason at all."`
`"Because they've forgotten about their revenge?"`
`"When revenge is impossible, they eventually tire of it and forget their original purpose.`
` When that happens, they have nothing except their gun.`
` Eventually, they'll keep shooting just so they can eat."`
`"......You're saying that child soldiers who started using guns for revenge...`
`end up as bandits or something?"`
`"After all, they've never even gone to school, and they haven't been taught any useful skills as far as employment is concerned."`
`They only learned how to shoot guns.`
`{n}And they were only ever praised when they killed the enemy.`
`"Eventually, your reason for living stops being revenge...and becomes the means you used to try and take it.`
` ......It's sad, really."`
`"Are you saying that I'll eventually get tired of revenge, and...`
`...uh, what would it be in my case?"`
`"You'll get tired of exposing the truth...`
`and your life will become entirely devoted to hating Ushiromiya Eva."`
`"Well, that's true already. Got a problem with it?"`
`"Hyahha...!`
` Come to think of it, that's right."`
`I'm not sure what Amakusa is trying to say.`
`{n}Probably something annoying.`
`So I'm not interested.`
`".........Revenge is stupid.`
` Is that what you're trying to say?"`
`"You still have a long life ahead of you, missy.`
` With your youth, you could do anything.`
` ......I get the feeling that this journey might be a waste of that precious youth."`
`"It's none of your business.`
` ......I already jumped, remember?`
` Off a skyscraper."`
`"And you were lucky enough to come out of that alive."`
`"Back then...`
`I died.`
` So, I'm already a ghost.`
` And my only purpose is to expose the truth of that day to take revenge on my family's killer."`
`"......I see.`
` That's an iron will you've got there, missy."`
`"There's no way a flippant man like you could understand how I feel."`
`After that, Amakusa was forced to shut his mouth.`
`He shrugged, but Ange didn't see.`
`Even so, Amakusa spoke once more.`
`"On the first day we started this journey,`
` ......you said something.`
` You said you wanted to know what happened on that island that day."`
`"It's the same now.`
` What's changed?"`
`"Now, you're saying...`
`that you want to know what happened on that island that day so you can expose Ushiromiya Eva's crime."`
`"And isn't that exactly the same?"`
`"......Well, that's true."`
`"I'm tired, so I'll sleep now.`
` Would you mind staying quiet for a bit?`
` Tell me when we get there."`
`"Roger that."`
`I wasn't particularly tired, really.`
`{n}I just said that because I didn't like talking about this.`
`"Don't become one.`
` A child soldier."`
`Ange, who had decided to feign sleep, ignored him.`
`{n}But Amakusa kept talking.`
` He wanted to make sure she heard at least this much.`
`"You started on a journey to learn the truth.`
` It's becoming more and more a journey of revenge.`
` .........A journey to have revenge by exposing the truth.`
` But, as you know, there's nothing left on Rokkenjima.`
` There aren't even any traces left.`
` ......Exposing the truth might not be a picnic."`
`......I know what Amakusa's trying to say.`
`The police searched the scene so thoroughly just after the crime, and even they weren't able to find any physical evidence proving that Ushiromiya Eva was the culprit.`
`And a full twelve years have passed since then.`
`......If the truth could be discovered by a girl like me, waving wads of cash around to pick up a bit of info from those who were somehow related to the incident,`
` then someone would have exposed the truth long ago.`
`I might not be able to reach the truth.`
`If so, .........then my first desire—to expose the truth—will probably fade away.`
`After that, only my hatred for Eva will remain.`
`Just like the child soldiers, who forget their original purpose and live just to shoot...`
`...I will forget my original purpose...and live just to hate.`
`For all my hate of Ushiromiya Eva, ......my revenge of exposing the truth will have been foiled,`
` ......but I will go on hating her anyway, and that will become all there is to my life.`
`......Is there any difference between shooting for revenge and shooting to live?`
`When you pull the trigger, someone dies either way.`
`And what about my case?`
`Is there any difference between hating Eva as I expose the truth...and hating Eva after I've given up?`
`There's no difference.`
`In the end, whether I find the truth or not, I'll just keep on cursing Eva, over and over, until I die.`
`............What a crappy life.`
`{n}But now...that's all I have left.`
`Ushiromiya Eva stole my family.`
`So, I'll take revenge.`
` ......By exposing her crimes and showing the world.`
`......My consciousness was slowly drifting away into sleep......`
`Why is Onii‐chan showing me such a bizarre Rokkenjima...?`
`Is this supposed to be the truth?`
`Enough with this farce.`
`Why is even Onii‐chan trying to hide the truth from me?`
`I'm trying to find it so that I can avenge him and the others.`
`.........Or would Onii‐chan say the same thing as Amakusa?`
`That revenge is meaningless, so I should stop.`
`Is that why......he's speaking in riddles, trying to make everything more confusing......?`
`.........That's none of his business.`
`I'm not just trying to take revenge for their sakes.`
`I'm doing it for my sake too.`
`{n}After all, that's the only thing I'm living for.`
`Taking revenge...is my reason to live.`
`..............................`
`I don't have a clue...`
`...what Onii‐chan is thinking.`
