`Outside, the rain had started to pour down hard.`
`However, inside the cousins' room, it was loud and cheery.`
`It could have been raining spears, and no one would have paid any attention.`
`"Ihihiii!!`
` Full hou~se!!`
` Take that!"`
`"Whoa.`
` You weren't bluffing...!"`
`The cousins were all bursting with energy, sitting in a circle on the bed.`
`"And I thought Battler always had crap in his hands every time he acted tough...!"`
`"Of course, I've been losing all this time just to make you think that!`
` Ushiromiya Battler, the man who loses strategically to win in the end! Ihihi!"`
`"Uu, Battler's amazing...!`
` All my coins are gone again."`
`"I'll give you some of mine.`
` Let's crush Battler together, okay?!"`
`With just a deck of cards, the cousins could enjoy themselves for many hours.`
`They were so engrossed that the occasional thunderbolt hardly even registered as static in the background.`
`"I'm starting to get hungry.`
` I wonder if dinner's ready yet."`
`"Who knows.`
` It should be ready soon.`
` Gohda‐san and the others really went all out for tonight."`
`"Heheh, which means we've got a lot to look forward to.`
` Is this to celebrate my long‐awaited return?"`
`"I heard from Shannon just now that it's going to be a Halloween party.`
` They'll set up a buffet in the hall.`
` Sounds incredible."`
`"A Halloween party?!`
` Wow, wow, uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Hmm?`
` Hello? Who is it?"`
`There was a knock, the door opened, and Ange was there.`
`Ange had been sleeping in her parents' room.`
`"Hey, it's you, Ange!`
` So, you woke up."`
`"Umm, they said it's dinner, so we have to go to the mansion.`
` They said to get ready."`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Food, foo~d!!`
` I'm hungry~~!!"`
`Perhaps because she was the hungriest, Maria celebrated more vigorously than anyone else.`
`She jumped up happily and hopped off the bed.`
`As the others all clambered off the bed and started putting their shoes on, Kyrie and Rudolf came into view.`
`"Hey, brats.`
` Time for food, so get ready."`
`"It looks like today will be extra special.`
` I can't wait to see."`
`"Uu!! I know!`
` It's a Halloween party!"`
`"......A Halloween party?"`
`"Kihhihihihihi!`
` I know, and Ange doesn't.`
` Kihhihihihi."`
`"Mom, what's a Halloween party?"`
`"Who knows?`
` We'll have to go and see for ourselves."`
`"Everyone ready?`
` It's about time to go."`
`"Is everyone here?`
` Please follow me."`
`"Maria, over here.`
` Your collar's crooked."`
`"Ah, I'm so hungry.`
` The food is the best part of these family conferences.`
` Are you hungry too, Ange‐chan?"`
`Eva smiled at Ange.`
`".........Yeah.`
` Starving."`
`"Ange.`
` "Yes, I am", right?"`
`"*giggle*. Don't worry about it.`
` Yeah, I'll bet you're starving.`
` My stomach's rumbling too."`
`"Okay, let's get out of here.`
` Looks like the wind's blowing hard outside.`
` Make sure you don't lose your umbrellas."`
`"Everyone, please take an umbrella."`
`"Here's your umbrella, Ange‐chan."`
`"Thanks, Auntie Eva."`
`"*giggle*.`
` ......Ah, girls really are so cute.`
` Come over to play at your auntie's house one of these days.`
` It's a promise, okay?"`
`"......It looks like Auntie Eva's taken a liking to Ange."`
`"Yep.`
` Apparently, Mother actually would have liked a daughter."`
`"Ah, I've heard that too.`
` I think she doted on me too, when I was little."`
`"My Mama said she actually wanted a son, uu!"`
`"If your kid grows up happily, it doesn't matter if they're a boy or a girl.`
` Maria is my precious, precious gift from God."`
`When they got outside, the wind was fairly strong.`
`Eva, who had now really hit it off with Ange, offered to share an umbrella with the little girl.`
`It was hard to tell what they were chatting so excitedly about, but it seemed that they were already getting along splendidly.`
`Battler opened his umbrella as he watched this.`
`His little sister was cute when she clung to him, but she was just as cute and adorable when looking up at someone else with a happy smile.`
`The wind and rain were strong, but even this must have been the perfect spice to heighten their anticipation of the coming meal......`
`Thanks to some festive decorations, the main hall had been remade into the scene of a Halloween party.`
`The Ushiromiya family always took meals in the dining hall.`
`This was the first time I'd ever seen a buffet‐style party set up in the main hall.`
`"Yo, Battleeer!`
` Hey, Maria! Long time no see...!"`
`"Beato!!`
` Happy Halloween!`
` Trick or treat...!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` I have some candy for you, but now is not the time.`
` After all, it's just before a meal."`
`"*giggle*.`
` Thank you, {f:5:Beatrice}‐san.`
` I see you're looking as beautiful as ever."`
`"You too, Rosa!`
` One would never guess you to be a mother.`
` Wahaha!"`
`"Have you been drinking?`
` Your ears are looking pretty red there."`
`"Hmm?`
` Well, after you left, uhihiii!`
` Kinzo told me he'd come into possession of an unusual drink, and well, a little alcohol never hurt anyone...!`
` Waha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!"`
`"And this coming from a person who tells little kids not to eat candy before a meal..."`
`"Pardon me.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, the Master is calling for you."`
`I saw Kinzo beckoning from over by the portrait.`
`"Good grief.`
` When it comes to ceremony, that man is always so obsessed with form."`
`"It's probably that stuff about a ceremony for the gold's return.`
` This is a huge turning point for the Ushiromiya family.`
` You'd better go and play along."`
`"It does make one feel a bit lonely though."`
`"This won't change the fact that you're the Ushiromiya family alchemist."`
`"Perhaps.`
` Then I'll be back shortly.`
` See you later, okay?`
` According to Genji, today's party has a bit of a twist to it.`
` You'd better look forward to it...!"`
`"You make it sound like you did any of the work."`
`"Wahhahahaha, you're another one who obsesses too much over details...!`
` Later!"`
`"......Onii‐chan, is something going to happen today?`
` Is it a special day......?"`
`It looked as though even Ange had picked up on that much.`
`{n}She seemed to be getting tense for no reason.`
`"This is a special day, for the Ushiromiya family.`
` But it doesn't have anything to do with you personally, so you should just relax."`
`"Okay.`
` ......Ah, that's right. Hey, hey, did you know?`
` I just heard a huge secret from Auntie Eva...!`
` Even Maria onee‐chan doesn't know, but I'll tell you!"`
`"Ooh?`
` So, what's this secret?"`
`"So, yeah!`
` I heard that, if there's an almond in it, you win...!"`
`"Win?`
` Is this like a lottery or something?"`
`"Hmmmmmmmmmm...`
` Anyway, if you get an almond, you win!"`
`Ange puffed out her cheeks.`
` Apparently, she wanted to be praised for sharing this exciting secret.`
`But just hearing that almonds win didn't really explain much.`
`"Okay, got it.`
` Thanks for letting me in on that major secret."`
`"Nnnnnnn, you're mean, Onii‐chan!`
` And I even told you my secret!"`
`Ange, her cheeks still puffed out, headed back to where Auntie Eva was.`
`They really are getting along well.`
` Still, I guess I have no problem if it's her aunt.`
`If it was some guy from her class, I don't care if they're both in elementary school, it's not happening!`
` No playing with the opposite sex without Onii‐chan's approval!`
`At that moment, Genji‐san's voice rang out.`
`The chatter gradually subsided, and the rain outside once again became apparent.`
`"Ladies and gentlemen, I ask for your silence."`
`Silence filled the room.`
`All of the relatives seemed vaguely aware that tonight's festivities consisted of more than a Halloween party.`
`Battler already knew.`
`This was a ceremony to mark the return of the gold, from Kinzo to {f:5:Beatrice}, which had been borrowed for so many years.`
`First off, that fact was announced by Kinzo himself.`
`He spoke of how this gold had not only restored the Ushiromiya family, but brought it to a level of wealth it had never before experienced.`
` He spoke of how he would finally return this gold to {f:5:Beatrice}, the one who had saved the Ushiromiya family.`
`A weighty ingot decorated with a bright red ribbon passed from his hands to hers.`
`".........The debt that the Ushiromiya family owes to the three generations of {f:5:Beatrice}, the Golden Witch,`
` is one that we shall never forget."`
`"Dear me.`
` I've nowhere to put it, but I suppose I can take it off your hands."`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"N‐nnn, *cough*cough*."`
`Despite her status, Beato's remark earned her a surprising warning from Genji.`
` I couldn't help but laugh.`
`"I am {f:5:Beatrice}, the Ushiromiya family alchemist.`
` Tonight, I acknowledge the end of the loan contract for the ten tons of gold.`
` ......Many decades have passed since my grandmother's generation.`
` The time has come for the eagle that lost one wing to fly once more.`
` I will watch over that eagle, and I pray for its prosperity in all generations to come."`
`Applause filled the hall.`
`Though she'd just managed to make such a dignified speech, as soon as it was over, she stuck her tongue out and leered at us.`
`I guess that's about the limit to how long Beato can stay serious.`
`"By passing her name on through the generations, {f:5:Beatrice}, the Golden Witch, may live for thousands of years.`
` Therefore, even her descendants shall be {f:5:Beatrice}, and all shall be alchemists to this family."`
`"The descendants of the Ushiromiya family will praise {f:5:Beatrice} for her gratitude forevermore, and this will be passed on through the generations.`
` .........This family will always be indebted to {f:5:Beatrice}, and she will always be our family, tied by a noble bond."`
`".........Let those who agree show their recognition with their applause."`
`After Genji's words, the relatives all looked at each other, then started applauding at once.`
`"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.`
` .........{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` You are a member of the Ushiromiya family.`
` And your bond to us is more sacred than one of blood."`
`"Wahaha, the relationship between debtor and creditor is indeed more important than blood."`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"Nngyhh, nnn...!"`
`After that, Kinzo's longwinded speech continued.`
`Tonight, Kinzo would retire as the Ushiromiya family head.`
`Then, he announced that he would reveal the distribution of his inheritance.`
`A stir of excitement spread across the siblings in money trouble when they heard that they wouldn't have to wait for Kinzo's death to get their inheritance.`
`"I am aware that each of you is in trouble with money.`
` This should be enough to resolve all of those problems.`
` ......But do not grow complacent.`
` This is my inheritance, given to you before my death."`
`"In the past, though I have been strict, I have always watched over you.`
` However, beginning tonight, your father will cease to provide support of that kind.`
` ......I shall watch on as you take flight, as though watching down upon you from the heavens.`
` No longer will I interfere.`
` ......You may live however you please."`
`"D-.........Dad......"`
`"Father......"`
`"We understand...`
` ......You need have no fear...that we'll take flight on our own."`
`"Here and now, all of us siblings swear to work together...`
`to make the Ushiromiya family even more prosperous."`
`"That's right...!`
` If we stick together, nothin' can stand in our way...!"`
`Hideyoshi laughed, but Genji admonished him.`
`{n}However, he could understand why they were so happy.`
`......So far, the siblings had quarreled ruthlessly over the inheritance.`
`However, this evening,`
` ......the inheritance had been neatly split apart, and they no longer had any need to scheme for money.`
`In other words, the siblings no longer had any reason to squabble with each other anymore.`
`On the contrary, this was a time for them to join hands and help each other become more and more prosperous.`
`Eva and Rosa were sniffling, with tears in their eyes.`
` ......And so was Rudolf.`
`Perhaps now, ......even at their ages,`
` ......they had finally left the nest.`
`Tonight, the eagles of the Ushiromiya family would leave Rokkenjima, the nest weaved from the witch's magic, and go their separate ways.`
` ......With their own power and determination.`
`It made Kinzo think.`
`{n}If only I had done this from the start...`
`......If he had settled the inheritance problem himself, there would have been no need for his children to quarrel at all.`
`Instead, he had acted in a sullen manner and left the problem to them, which had resulted in their strained relationships to each other.`
`Yes.`
` All of that had been his responsibility.`
`{n}And now, he was disentangled.`
`It had been like an invisible rope wrapped around Kinzo's body.`
`That rope had now come loose, and he felt a sense of release he hadn't experienced for many years...`
`The four siblings stepped forward, and before Kinzo, they swore to all support Krauss, the new head, and lead the family to greater prosperity.`
`Their faces sparkled with an unexpected youthfulness.`
`It was only natural.`
` After all, the four of them had not been so naturally united.........since the time they were kids.`
`As the vibrancy of their youth returned to them, the siblings banded together once again.`
`When Krauss finished his announcement, a warm round of applause filled the hall.`
`The cousins...`
`and the servants too...`
`...joined in on the applause that continued on and on.`
`Ange......watched this, dumbfounded.`
`............The four siblings had quarreled with each other constantly since they were kids, ......supposedly.`
`Supposedly, they had pointlessly locked swords with Kinzo's inheritance as their goal, their worries over money spurring them on.`
`......Even the world of "truth", the world I acknowledge, ......has been rewritten by this golden ceremony.`
`Were they actually friendly towards each other, or did they quarrel all the time like I believe? It doesn't matter.`
`......Either way, right here, right now, all of those problems have been resolved.`
`I mustn't believe.`
` .........This is just...Onii‐chan's farce.`
`Even though I knew that fact,`
` .........when I watched Dad and the others hugging each other, with teary smiles on their faces, ......I couldn't help but feel something warm welling up in my eyes.`
`"I won't believe it......`
` .........All of this......is just another part of your farce........."`
`"What will you have to see, what will you have to hear,`
` before you'll let yourself believe...?"`
`".........Red.`
` ............If you say it with the red truth..."`
`"Is everything you can't say in red a lie?"`
`"......I won't believe...`
` ......This is......just........."`
`Ange looked at the floor and fell silent.`
`As the Game Master, Battler was able to use the red truth.`
`However, that rule only exists on the witch's game board.`
`In the world of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, red truth...doesn't exist.`
`People see things, hear things,`
` ......and when they believe that something is worth believing, they accept it as a red truth.`
`Unless Ange accepts it, no kind of truth can become truth.`
`Battler wanted her to realize this.`
`There was no point in using the red truth, a rule of this game, to force the truth on her.`
`Ange would have to use her own power, her own heart,`
` to accept the truth as truth.`
`The decision was Ange's.`
`{n}No one could force her to decide either way.`
`So, there was nothing wrong with Ange declaring this scene to be a farce.`
`But, if so, .........then what was the meaning of the hot tears dripping down Ange's face?`
`......Ange would have to consider that herself, without anyone telling her......`
`After one sniffle and a rub of her eyes, Ange let the six‐year‐old version of herself take control of her piece.`
`What followed was a harmonious, fun stretch of time.`
`Beautifully adorned dishes were brought in one after another, and champagne corks were loosened with pleasant sounds.`
`Several small tables were set here and there, each with its own theme.`
`That was where the fun lay in this stand‐up buffet party, as the guests wandered from table to table, pondering what they should eat first.`
`This sort of performance was where Gohda's genius shone through.`
` The hotel that let him go should probably regret ever having done so.`
`Of course, a stand‐up buffet would probably be a tiring affair for the middle‐aged.`
`So, chairs had been set up as well.`
`However, each time a new dish was brought into the hall, they could get up to look, and wander the tables however they pleased.`
`This way, they could each bump into a new group of people, then mingle elsewhere when that group melted apart.`
`People are interesting.`
` As the members in each group changed, so did the topic of conversation.`
`The bustling Halloween party played out like a colorful kaleidoscope.`
`The origami chains decorating the walls recalled one to one's youth.`
`They would make anyone enjoy themselves as they did when they were kids......`
`Even to Ange, it was like a dream.`
`She chatted happily with her cousins.`
`She also chatted with her aunts and uncles.`
`Beato showed her several tricks that she called magic.`
`Maria said they were magic, Ange said they were tricks, and the night grew even more lively.`
`The two young girls were so fired up that the adults decided to show some tricks they knew, shocking both of the kids utterly.`
`Eventually, they each started showing tricks to the others, asking if they'd ever seen this one or that one before,`
` and it became a party of magic, just perfect for Halloween.`
`In addition to magic tricks, several quizzes, riddles and games popped up, reminding everyone of their childhood days.`
`Even the servants who were serving food got dragged into the groups, and the whole hall filled with chatter.`
`To Ange, young as she was, every single magic trick, quiz, and riddle was an entirely new experience.`
`They stimulated her intellectual curiosity, and she couldn't contain her excitement.`
`Add in the wide variety of delicious foods and drinks she could choose from, and it was like being in a dream.`
`Ange felt a floaty sensation, as though she was walking on a cloud......`
`"Ange, ...you didn't drink this, did you?!`
` This is Daddy's drink!"`
`"......I wanted to try some adult grape juice too.`
` So it's okay."`
`"Your face is looking a little red there.`
` Are you feeling okay?"`
`"She only had a bit, so I think she'll be fine......"`
`"......I'll be fine.`
` I'm not a kid......`
` ......*hic*..."`
`"*giggle*.`
` Ange‐chan, drink this one, okay?`
` Your Dad's drinking a bad drink, so don't try any more, got it?"`
`"That's right!`
` If you drink bad stuff, you'll end up as a bad adult too. Ihihi!"`
`"I'm not gonna be a bad adult!`
` I'm gonna be a princess!"`
`"That's right.`
` Ange is a princess to all of us."`
`"Yep.`
` Ange's this family's princess."`
`"She's a princess to me, too.`
` You'd better come over to my house to play sometime...!`
` We'll have lots and lots of fun!"`
`"Okay.`
` Thanks, Auntie Eva...!"`
`Everyone was being really nice to me.`
`It almost felt like I'd become a real princess.`
`I felt so great, I could almost believe that this whole celebration was being held for my sake.`
`Battler stood outside that group of people.`
` As he watched Ange smiling happily from a distance, he smiled too.`
`".........When she smiles like that, she really lives up to her name.`
` It's so sad."`
`"I agree.`
` It really is a smile fit for an angel."`
`"I hope that smile belongs to the real Ange...and not just the piece."`
`"......Even if it doesn't, she is watching this.`
` And she can think it through herself."`
`"This game between you and Ange really is overflowing with affection.`
` For me, it's almost irritating."`
`"And what's wrong with that?`
` No one to get in her way.`
` No obstacles or tactics or anything else to worry about."`
`"That's right.`
` This game...is no longer a battle."`
`"I'd call it......cleaning up.`
` ......After our game."`
`"............I will never be able to make up for the sin I did to her through my careless actions."`
`"Our game was responsible.`
` We'll make up for our sins together.`
` ......That's why we're showing Ange this final game."`
`"Do you think...that Ange will be able to use that key the right way...?"`
`"......Of course, I've thought about forcibly dragging her in the way we think is right."`
`"Such an attempt may have been meaningless.`
` ......As long as life is, it is hard to accept that a decision you were forced into was truly the correct one."`
`"Exactly.`
` .........Ange must think and choose by herself.`
` Even if she doesn't make the decision we view as the correct one, ......I think we should respect it."`
`"......Hmmm.`
` .........You are the Game Master.`
` It is no longer my place to argue.`
` I will simply watch on and enjoy this night."`
`"This game is very significant for Ange.`
` But for us, it's kind of like a party after the show."`
`"It's almost time.`
` But are you sure?`
` Ange might get the wrong idea again, right?"`
`"It'll be fine.`
` In fact, this is necessary.`
` ......Just like how you appeared in the way you did.`
` And everyone else too."`
`"...............Hmmm.`
` Then let us enjoy this final celebration with the others.`
` After all, all of them have acted their parts so well in this long game."`
`That instant, the sound of someone clapping for attention rang out.`
`"Your attention, everyone. Please gather.`
` And now, for today's special event...!"`
`Gohda had been the one clapping.`
` Everyone gathered together, wondering what was going on.`
`On the serving cart in front of him was a large, sliced, chocolate cake.`
`"As the highlight of tonight's Halloween party, I have prepared this Sachertorte for you all.`
` As you can see, this was made specially for the Ushiromiya family, and bears the crest of the One‐winged Eagle in chocolate!"`
`The stupendous cake drew a gasp of admiration from all present.`
`"What a splendid cake...!`
` A perfect highlight for the party."`
`"Oh, no.`
` It's not just the cake.`
` Tonight's cake has a little secret.`
` ......Master, I ask that you explain that secret to everyone!"`
`"Very well.`
` This is a bit of a game.`
` There's one, tiny thing in this cake that will make you a winner."`
`"It's an almond...!"`
`Ange shouted happily.`
` Kinzo looked at her fondly and nodded.`
`"In just one slice of this cake, there is a single almond.`
` The one who chooses that piece will become tonight's king."`
`"Whoo!`
` It's been a long time since I played the king game...!"`
`"I'm guessing the subject matter was a bit different when you played it..."`
`"Hahhahahahahahaha.`
` So, what happens to the person who becomes the king?"`
`"The king gets to name one wish.`
` Then, we shall all try to grant it together."`
`"Oooh!`
` Sounds interesting...!"`
`"Uu.`
` Kings are boys.`
` Girls can't be kings."`
`"If a girl wins, they get to become the princess."`
`"The almond!`
` The one with the almond wins!`
` Right? Right?!"`
`"Ahahahaha, that's right.`
` You're incredible, Ange."`
`"Times like this are when a man's luck shines through.`
` Can't let myself lose now!"`
`"Hold up there.`
` Let's let the smallest kids choose first."`
`"Good idea.`
` Ange‐chan, you can go first."`
`"Hey, you're the big cousin now, Maria!`
` Let Ange‐chan go first."`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!`
` But what if Ange wins, uu!"`
`"I am gonna win!`
` The almond wins, the almond wins!"`
`"It seems we old fogies must hope that leftovers are lucky today."`
`"If we're going by age, I guess that means Kinzo's last."`
`"Wahhahahahaha, but weren't you a thousand years old?"`
`"N‐nooooooooo!!"`
`Everyone burst out laughing.`
` Her real age was unknown, but she claimed to be 19 years old.`
`In front of Ange lay a large cake, cut so that there was one piece for each of them.`
`Just one of those pieces was the winner.`
`"Well then, Ange‐sama.`
` Which piece would you like?`
` Whichever you choose, it will be ever so delicious."`
`"No way.`
` I only want the winning one."`
`"Well then, you'll have to try and guess right on the first shot.`
` Go ahead, pick one."`
`Battler pushed Ange's small back towards the table with the cake.`
`"............Which one......should I take............?"`
`The chocolate cake was cut into fifteen pieces.`
`{n}......I wanna pick the one with an almond and become the princess!`
`One of them has the winning almond. Which could it be...?`
`I get to choose first, ......but it sort of feels unfair.`
`I mean, it is, isn't it?`
` My chances of getting the right one are 1 in 15.`
` There's no way I'll get it.`
`And then, when Maria onee‐chan goes after me, she has a 1 in 14 chance of picking the winner.`
` The next person has a 1 in 13 chance, then a 1 in 12 chance, ......and the last person......will win for sure??`
`"Onii‐chan, this isn't fair...!`
` The person who goes first has a disadvantage...!"`
`Everyone laughed.`
` Apparently, there was something wrong with my calculations, but it still didn't feel right to me.`
`"Come now, let us start this contest of luck with Ange‐sama.`
` Please, feel free to make your selection...!"`
`"......Okay!`
` Okay......!!"`
`If I have to pick one out of so many, there's no way I'll win.`
`......But for some reason, tonight, it feels like I might actually win after all.`
`I have no reason for feeling this way, but when I'm in a good mood, Lady Luck always brings me fortune.`
`"Have you decided yet?"`
`"Yeah.`
` .........I've decided.`
` This one's...the winner."`
`I concentrated on my fingertip......and pointed at one of the 15 slices.`
`The slice I chose was............`
`".........This one!"`
`"This one? Are you sure?"`
`"I've made up my mind.`
` I want this one...!"`
`When he asked me whether I was sure, I felt a little uneasy.`
`Still, at times like this, it's better to stick with your instincts.`
`It was one of the few bits of philosophy that the young girl had learned from her few life experiences.`
`Gohda took the chosen slice, put it on a plate with a fork, and handed it to Ange.`
`"I go next!!`
` Uu‐uu, which should I take!"`
`It was Maria's turn next.`
` She was excited, determined to be the winner.`
`I walked away from that group, all by myself.`
`......I was struck by a temptation to quickly cut the cake open with my fork and check for an almond inside.`
`However, I stopped myself.`
`If I check my piece first, my chance of winning is 1 in 15.`
`However, if I wait for some other people to check their slices, then when I see that they've lost, my chances will go up, if only slightly.`
`In other words, instead of searching for the almond right away,`
` my chances will go up if I wait for some other people to lose.`
`But if someone picks a winner while I'm sitting around here, the chances of my slice being a winner will go to zero.`
` It'll be tough to calculate the right moment.`
`I need to wait just long enough for as many losers to show up as possible.`
` My chances of winning are highest if I can check my piece immediately before someone else wins.`
`Yeah, that's the trick to winning this game!`
`...........................`
`............???`
`{n}What a strange thought.`
` ......It feels like I'm missing something??`
`Even though no one else can touch the cake that's sitting in front of me...`
`The almond inside it will appear or disappear depending on whether or not the other people win or lose.`
`.........??`
`I was in such a good mood that I felt dizzy, and I couldn't figure out what was wrong with my theory.`
`But I did realize that something was strange.`
`......There is always just one truth inside a cat box.`
`No matter what happens outside the box, ......it shouldn't be able to shake the truth inside.`
`And yet, ......I'm being influenced by events outside the cat box and trying to make them affect my observation of the box's contents.`
`.................................`
`I don't even know what I'm saying.`
`Another me inside me is trying to say that, ......but it's too hard for me to understand.`
`I feel like I'm drifting......`
`I got so cheery and excited that, even though I'm not sleepy, my mind feels hazy.`
`Maybe it's 'cause I drank Dad's adult drink......`
`In the end, even though I'd chosen the first piece, I decided to check it last.`
`After I've seen that everyone else has lost, my chances of winning will be 100%.`
`......I tried to find the contradiction in my thinking, but I didn't really get it, so I stopped.`
`It's much better to have a 100% chance than a 1 in 15 one, so I decided to bet on that.`
`I couldn't wait to open this precious treasure chest,`
` but I waited for everyone else to choose their pieces and check them.`
`"How is it going?`
` Has anyone found a winner?"`
`"Uu!`
` Mine didn't have one."`
`"I lost too.`
` And I wanted to be the princess...!"`
`"Even if you lose, this Sachertorte really is beautiful and delicious.`
` It's such a good decoration, it's almost a shame to eat it."`
`"How about you?`
` Find any almond?"`
`"No, not me either.`
` What about you, Hideyoshi nii‐san?"`
`"Mine's a loser too.`
` Looks like I've used up all my luck with my company and my wife."`
`"What exactly do you mean by that?"`
`"What about you, Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"I'm checking it now.`
` Games like this can truly can be fun, every now and then."`
`"Yes.`
` Sometimes, a simple test of luck, without any strategy or tactics, can be quite entertaining.`
` What about you, Beato?"`
`"Where's the liar who said leftovers would be lucky?!`
` Grrrrrrrr...!"`
`"What about you, Ange?`
` Was there an almond in yours?"`
`"I'm checking now......"`
`"Oh, you still haven't touched yours?"`
`I was following my own personal probability theory,`
` ......but I didn't think I could explain it well to Onii‐chan, so I didn't mention it to him.`
`I wonder if there's an almond in there.`
`{n}If I win, I'll be tonight's princess.`
`......I'll be happy if I win, but even if I don't, it'll still be a really fun night, so that's okay.`
`It stopped when this cake game started, but before then, everyone was having a lot of fun trading tricks, quizzes, and riddles.`
`This game is fun too, but I want to play like that again soon.`
`..................Huh?`
`"What's up, Ange?`
` .........Oh?"`
`I stared at the tiny thing on my fork, then showed it to my brother.`
`"This......is an almond, right...?"`
`"Wh‐whoa!!`
` Ange got it!`
` That's awesome...!"`
`At the same time, a stir rose up in the other corner of the room.`
`"I got one, I won...!"`
`"Hoh!`
` So Eva won...!"`
`"My, my!`
` Congratulations, Eva‐sama...!!"`
`"That's wrong!!`
` I won!`
` Mine has the almond!!"`
`I held the almond high and shouted across the room.`
`{n}The crowd around Eva split, and everyone stared at me, surprised.`
`I was surprised too.`
` The thing in her hand was, without a doubt, an almond...`
`"What the heck...?`
` What's going on here...?"`
`"Gohda.`
` There seem to be two almonds, ......so are they both winners?"`
`"But, .........that shouldn't have......"`
`"Does this mean that one of the two made a mistake...?"`
`"Ange‐sama's is clearly an almond.`
` ......How about your end, Kanon‐kun?"`
`"Eva‐sama's is clearly an almond."`
`"Hohhohohohohoho.`
` Then it seems that they both win."`
`"............My lord."`
`"Heheheheheheh...!`
` What an odd occurrence.`
` What's all this, Gohda?"`
`"Ah, umm, ......well, ......it seems we've had a little mistake......`
` Uh, ......perhaps they should do rock, paper—"`
`"Come now, don't be stingy.`
` It just means that two almonds have appeared to signify the queen and the princess."`
`"Precisely.`
` Let's have them both be winners."`
`"Ah, well, but........."`
`Gohda was hesitant.`
`Actually, he had prepared a single special dessert for the king.`
`It had been decorated in a way that made it hard to split for two people.`
` So, it wasn't convenient for there to be two kings.`
`When Eva heard Gohda mumbling something to this effect, she shrugged and laughed.`
`"In that case, let's have Ange‐chan be the princess."`
`"The princess!`
` I'm the princess...?!"`
`"I'll be your attendant.`
` That works, right?"`
`Of course it worked.`
`Ange had been worried that Eva would be declared the winner, since she had spoken up first.`
`So, she hadn't even dreamed that Eva would give it up to her.`
`"But, are you sure...?`
` You won too."`
`"It's okay. I get to be your attendant.`
` Come, princess.`
` What wish do you want granted...?`
` Let's hear it."`
`"I've.........already chosen my wish......"`
`"Oh.`
` And what is it?`
` Won't you tell your auntie?"`
`I want this fun time to keep on going.`
` ......Forever.`
`The young me spoke for the desire in my heart.`
`"I, ......I want all the fun stuff from before...to keep going!"`
`I get the feeling that the nuance has changed.`
`{n}Still, that was unmistakably my wish.`
`"From before?`
` ......Oh, you mean those tricks and quizzes?"`
`"Yeah!"`
`"Then this is what we'll do.`
` Listen up, everyone.`
` This is an order from your princess.`
` Remember how much fun we were having before this?`
` Let's all entertain Ange‐chan with tricks and quizzes."`
`"Hold up there.`
` I already used up all my material for tricks."`
`"Then let's do quizzes and riddles."`
`"So, we all just have to entertain Ange‐chan with quizzes?"`
`"We can all present quizzes to our princess to entertain her."`
`"I see.`
` Understood."`
`"Wahahaha!`
` Yes, how intriguing.`
` Then, Ange, let us do it this way.`
` Everyone will give you a quiz or a riddle, and you can try to solve them.`
` Each time you succeed, I will give you a medal."`
`"A medal?"`
`"He probably means commemorative medals.`
` If you get a lot of puzzles right, you'll get a lot of medals."`
`"Hohhohohohoho.`
` Just gathering medals is a tad boring, don't you think?"`
`"Yes.`
` Depending on the number of medals you collect, I shall give you a fantastic present...!`
` Well, do you suddenly feel fired up?!"`
`"It sounds amazing.`
` So, there's even a prize...!"`
`"*giggle*.`
` Isn't that great, Ange?"`
`"Y‐......yeah...!"`
`Everyone gathered around me, smiling, as they thought about what sort of puzzle they'd give.`
`They're all thinking about me, so that they can play with me.`
`Just the feel of having that all to myself almost made me explode with joy at becoming the princess.`
