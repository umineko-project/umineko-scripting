`A beautiful glow shone in from the skylight over the grand cathedral. `
`The place was somehow different from the way it had been during the witches' trial. `
`The decorations had changed. `
`The several pleasantly sparkling white ribbons that adorned it were thin like razors, but they trailed beautifully in the air. `
`Flowers were arranged all over in a way that would make any place look cheerful. `
`It was like how a single drop of impure water can spoil an entire cask of wine. `
`Just the presence of those flowers, those ribbons, and the red carpet that ran down the center of the room... `
`made it hard to believe that this was the same place Ushiromiya Natsuhi had been falsely accused of a crime... `
`It had truly become...a wedding chapel. `
`"Love is generous, love is merciful!" `
`"Love does not envy, it does not boast!" `
`These words, spoken by two demons who seemed to be in charge of this gathering, were part of a ceremony for making an oath of love before the eyes of God. `
`Of course, in this wedding celebrated by demons, there was no priest in sight. `
`Instead, there stood the witch who controls miracles. `
`"In sickness and in health. `
`...Yeah, a wife's true job is to be supportive in times of sickness. `
`Isn't that right, Erika?" `
`"...Yes, `
`my master..." `
`"That looks good on you. `
`What a fitting outfit for one who has conquered the bridegroom. `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*." `
`"Heheheheheheheheheh. `
`I'm honored, my master." `
`The bride standing on the carpeted path...was Furudo Erika. `
`...The groom's face couldn't be seen. `
`The bride's outfit certainly was a pure-white wedding dress. `
`Her veil represented both the white of God's blessings...and the white of a demon's cruelty. `
`A great many goat nobles, witches, and demons were gathered for this wedding. `
`If only their heads hadn't been those of goats, `
`it would probably have seemed a very refined crowd worthy of this great cathedral... `
`"...I'd expect no less of you, Bern. `
`The stuff you manage to think up is always so twisted." `
`"A wife supporting her ailing husband. `
`...Isn't that a lovely story? `
`It suits you well, Erika." `
`"...And...congratulations to you too, `
`...Mr. Groom." `
`At that point, ...Bernkastel stared straight into the groom's eyes. `
`The groom... `
`...didn't answer. `
`His eyes were gray. `
`...His lips would mutter something from time to time, but no one could tell if the words meant anything. `
`{a:c: `
`"Hey, ......{i:are you listening}? `
`You people?"} `
`She spoke to the groom in the plural. `
`...Of course, there was only one groom. `
`And, of course, the gray-eyed groom didn't answer... `
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle* `
`So, even though you can hear her, you can't answer? `
`...Don't worry, okay, `
`Battler-san?" `
`"......Nn.........ghhh..." `
`"It's okay, I'll just take everything you are... `
`and trample it into the ground... `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!" `
`Hahhahahahahahahaahahahahahaahahahahaha...!! `
`The Witch of Miracles sneered with an evil smile that even a demon would shudder to look at. `
`Even that sneer... `
`...provoked no response... `
`...from Battler's dim eyes. `
`"People live for the sake of love! `
`Therefore, today, you have fulfilled the purpose of your lives." `
`"Oh, how great is the power to live, the power of love...! `
`I pray that the brightness of this day blesses these two for all time!" `
`"...Just give it a rest already, you demons. `
`What comes next?" `
`"The couple will now make an oath of eternal love." `
`"After that, they will exchange rings...!" `
`On Battler's hand...was a ring bearing the seal of the One-Winged Eagle, proof that he was the territory lord of this world. `
`And on Erika's finger was a diamond ring that could not be shattered by any miracle. `
`Diamonds signify an 'eternal bond'. `
`However, in Greek, the word diamond simply means 'unbreakable'. `
`Erika wasn't vowing to love Battler forever. `
`She just wanted to rule over him as her eternal property. `
`This wedding was being performed...for the sole purpose of defiling Battler. `
`"...Don't worry. `
`I won't love you forever. `
`After all, the point of this ceremony is to make you submit to me. `
`...Your heart will be shut inside an inescapable closed room forever...where I, Furudo Erika, the detective and the Witch of Truth, will command it. `
`Your position as territory lord and your ring will become mine..." `
`"......Can't... `
`...get..." `
`"...Hmm? `
`What was that?" `
`"......Nn...nngg...... `
`...Can't...get out..." `
`"Pfft, ...ha...hahahahahahahahaha...! `
`Yeah, I'll bet you can't get out of that closed room. `
`After all, you made it yourself. `
`You'll suffer in that room for all eternity. `
`And I'll remain by your side as your wife forever, getting to enjoy that look of anguish on your face all by myself. `
`*giggle*giggle*, ahhahahahahahahaha...!! `
`I'll defile you forever, `
`...Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!!!" `
