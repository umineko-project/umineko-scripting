`A dreary breeze blew through the golden rose garden... `
`Shannon and Kanon had already finished walking 19 steps, their backs still facing each other. `
`...When the demons conducting the trial gave the signal, they would both turn...and settle this. `
`Each had one of the dueling pistols given by the demons in their hands. `
`The bullets...promised certain death no matter where on the body they hit. `
`This duel would not end... `
`...until one of them died... `
`"........." `
`"........." `
`George and Jessica...just quietly watched the ones they loved... `
`They had already entrusted all of their thoughts to them, ...as well as their fates. `
`Just watching over their partners...was now the only way they could show their trust. `
`"........." `
`"........." `
`Shannon and Kanon...stood quietly, with their backs turned. `
`They had already...set aside the feelings they'd built up during all those days they'd known each other. `
`The next time they laid eyes on the other... `
`...Nothing would be asked of them except pulling that trigger. `
`The only one who still couldn't muster any determination or resolve towards this duel... `
`was Beato. `
`The closer that moment came, ...the less she understood. `
`The love between George and Shannon wasn't standing in the way of the love between Jessica and Kanon or vice versa. `
`...Why, when both sides could find happiness, ...were they being forced to kill each other...? `
`"...I don't understand. `
`...I just can't...understand...!" `
`"......Little sister, `
`we are not permitted to do anything but watch..." `
`"Zepar-san, Furfur-san...! `
`Why...why this duel?! `
`This is no trial of love! `
`You really are demons! `
`You just want to enjoy watching one of the pairs fall apart, don't you...?!!" `
`"Silence." `
`"You'll get in the way of the lovers." `
`"You're the ones getting in their way!! `
`One will fall! `
`The one who loves that person will grieve!! `
`If only you two weren't around, no one would be sad!!" `
`""That is not true."" `
`"If we hadn't set up this duel-" `
`"Then both pairs would have fallen apart. `
`This duel is necessary." `
`"I...haven't been able to accept that since the beginning...!! `
`You say their love can't be successful without a miracle of magic?! `
`What does love need other than two people who love each other?! `
`This duel is meaningless!!" `
`"So stop it, you two!! `
`Shannon and Kanon both!! `
`Why must you fight each other to the death, when you were once as close as true siblings?! `
`I just can't......understand!!!" `
`Everyone should have been able to hear Beato's yell. `
`...However, no one's expression changed. `
`"...That's right. `
`I'm impressed that you noticed." `
`"This is love's truth." `
`"......What is...?!!" `
`"Normally, love needs nothing more than two people who love each other." `
`"Therefore, when there aren't 'two people', `
`...we must use a duel to make that number become 'two'." `
`"I could understand if it were a duel between two people fighting over one woman! `
`If it were a duel to cut three people in love down to two...!! `
`But here we have two pairs of people!! `
`The world formed by each pair is complete, isn't it?!! `
`There's nothing compelling them to fight!!" `
`"The minimum number of people that can create a world is two." `
`"A world can only be born, love can only be fulfilled, ...when two people gather." `
`"That's why this duel is necessary." `
`"So that they can get up to that number of people." `
`"A-Are you saying that furniture is sub-Human, so they don't count as a single person...?!" `
`""Exactly. `
`Furniture is sub-Human. `
`That's why furniture and a Human cannot add up to two people."" `
`"That's insane! `
`Status has nothing to do with it, if both of them love each other!!" `
`""No, it does!!"" `
`"Do you really think that the status of a pair of lovers doesn't matter?!" `
`"Is a man who has a wife allowed to love someone else? `
`Is a woman who has a husband allowed to love someone else?" `
`"Are you allowed to fall in love with your parents? `
`Are you allowed to fall in love with your children? `
`There are many situations where status makes love unallowable!!" `
`"Th-Then just what is furniture?!! `
`Why mustn't furniture fall in love?!!!" `
`"Because their soul is less than a single person!"" `
`"Shannon, Kanon, and of course the piece that you are!!" `
`"All of you are furniture! `
`Subhuman beings who possess less than a single person's soul!!" `
`"To be qualified to love a human, you need only one thing! `
`The possession of a single person's soul!! `
`That's why a pair in love can create a world!!" `
`"For example, do you think a man with a wife has the right to love another woman?" `
`"......Of course not. `
`If he loved two women, neither would get a full person's worth of love. `
`...A man such as that would be unworthy of love." `
`"See? `
`There are plenty of statuses and humans who have no right to love a person!! `
`As long as both people feel love, nothing else matters? `
`That's just the hypocrisy of naive love!!" `
`"We cannot forgive humans who falsely pretend that they have the right to love!! `
`We cannot forgive the love of sub-Human beings, of those who don't make up the minimum number of people required to create a world!!" `
`""That is the purpose of our trial...!! `
`It is to let the sinful souls regain a complete soul and become capable of true love!!"" `
`"...Zepar-sama, Furfur-sama." `
`"Our hearts...are ready." `
`""Please, give the signal to start the duel."" `
`The pair bidding farewell quietly asked for the signal to be given. `
`Zepar nodded silently, then walked to a place that could be seen by both of them. `
`Furfur spoke in a voice quiet enough to avoid distracting the two duelists. `
`"......Watch." `
`"Watch the duel to see which of the lovers will fall apart...?" `
`"No, this isn't a duel to see who falls apart. `
`...This is a duel to make true love succeed." `
`"...I...don't understand...what you two are saying...!" `
`"No, you must understand. `
`This marks...the birth of a Human who can truly love another." `
`"I don't...understand......!!!" `
`"No matter which wins, ...please support them. `
`...Right now, ...their days as furniture will end." `
`"The signal is simple. `
`...I will count to three. `
`When I reach three, the duel will commence." `
`"Understood." `
`"...Same here." `
`"If both miss, the duel will be temporarily suspended. `
`You will be given bullets again and will start over from the beginning, with your backs to each other." `
`"......I guess it'll repeat until it's all settled..." `
`"Zepar, `
`...have you seen this sort of duel many times in the past?" `
`"Of course, `
`I've seen many of them." `
`"...Usually, how many times do they need to face off before it's over?" `
`"In almost all cases, it's decided in the first round." `
`"They must all be really good shots..." `
`"That's not it. `
`...If one side misses, the other can corner them at their leisure and shoot. `
`...If the first bullet misses, then you've lost your chance at victory." `
`"However, if you take too long, you'll lose before you can even pull the trigger." `
`"...If you're going to lose anyway, you'd at least want to have pulled the trigger first." `
`"Your resolve is good, you two. `
`......Then, ......let's go." `
`"One." `
`"Two." `
`""Three."" `
`In the golden rose garden, `
`...when the number three was yelled, `
`...the sound of gunfire rang out once... `
`Even the people watching couldn't tell whether that was a single gun firing... `
`or the sound of both going off at the same time... `
`In the midst of the stench of gunpowder and white smoke, `
`...there, with gun raised and smoke trailing the barrel, `
`...was Kanon. `
`......And, lying on the earth, `
`...was Shannon... `
`"...Sh- `
`Shannon... `
`san......" `
`"...No. `
`...Shannon fell before the gun fired..." `
`"Nn...gah......" `
`Jessica's distressed expression...was enough to explain what had happened... `
`...Slowly, `
`...Shannon... `
`...stood up. `
`There was no bullet wound anywhere on her body. `
`...At the time of the signal, Shannon had thrown herself to the ground, ...dodging the bullet. `
`It had been a bet. `
`If Kanon had turned around and taken the time to aim carefully before shooting, `
`...then he would have shot her as she lay there. `
`However, ...if Kanon shot as soon as he turned around, ...she would be able to dodge it. `
`Kanon had also made a bet. `
`He did not underestimate Shannon's skill with a firearm. `
`He was fully aware that, if he assumed Shannon would be timid enough to let him shoot first, `
`he would lose before even pulling the trigger. `
`So, he had decided to shoot right away. `
`And, he had predicted that when he shot, Shannon would reflexively pull the trigger too. `
`Since he intended to shoot right away, he would be more mentally prepared, ...so he was confident that he'd be able to shoot accurately. `
`If Kanon had cautiously turned around, `
`and Shannon had shot instantly with the strength of her will, then Kanon wouldn't even have been able to pull the trigger. `
`So, no impatience on Kanon's part was to blame here. `
`......The two had simply given it their all, left their fates to the heavens, `
`...and reached this result. `
`"........." `
`"......I didn't imagine... `
`...that my quick-tempered Nee-san... `
`...wouldn't shoot at all..." `
`"I'm surprised too. `
`...To think that old, prudent Kanon-kun...would shoot as soon as he turned." `
`As Shannon quietly pointed the barrel at him, she slowly walked forward. `
`She planned on cautiously closing the gap until she reached a distance from which she could hit with even more certain accuracy. `
`And Kanon......had already lost any means of fighting back. `
`He could only try to dodge Shannon's bullet...and place his bet on the second round. `
`......If they both thought this, `
`...then what happened next would turn that assumption on its head. `
`".........!!" `
`"This isn't...over yet!!!" `
`Kanon dashed forward like a tornado, bent over so low that he was almost crawling over his shadow... `
`This duel could only be settled by a bullet, `
`...but he wasn't the only one who had a bullet. `
`If he could steal Shannon's gun away from her, he could turn this fight around...! `
`And, if Shannon calmly shot through Kanon, it would end! `
`The odds that Shannon would miss, or that he could get close enough to her before she fired... `
`Kanon would bet all the chips he had on them. `
`Shannon could draw Kanon in until the last second, then shoot him from a closer distance. `
`If she pulled the trigger just before he reached her, then even if she missed, they would just start again from the beginning. `
`...Shannon kept her gun pointing at Kanon's forehead as she compared these options until the final moment. `
`She led her shot, calculating the distance he had already moved and the time it would take to pull the trigger. `
`......The goddess of fortune smiles impartially. `
`"...Uuuwooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!" `
`"N-No!!!" `
`Surviving past the final moment Shannon could have shot, Kanon barreled into her chest. `
`He then swung his hand up and knocked the gun Shannon held into the air. `
`That strike sent Shannon's gun flying into the sky. `
`At the same time, Kanon's gun also flew from his hand and danced through the air. `
`The two guns danced a rondo through the sky, reached their peak, ...and began to fall. `
`By that time, neither knew whose gun was which. `
`The two guns were exactly the same. `
`Everything about them was identical. `
`There was no way to tell them apart. `
`However, there was one difference. `
`......Only one of them had a bullet inside. `
`The pair raised their hands to the sky, `
`trying to grasp their fate, `
`...their miracle. `
`It was as though... `
`they were trying to grasp the wings of a descending angel of miracles. `
`The pair looked up at the brilliant sky... `
`...and entrusted everything to the goddess of fortune. `
`...Then, they each grabbed one of the guns out of the air, `
`and after dancing a momentary rondo, ......their arms crossed each other. `
`Even that had been like a dance. `
`Then, they each pressed the barrel of their gun up against the other's forehead, both as steady as a rock. `
`"............" `
`"............" `
`Even they could not know...which gun held the bullet. `
`When they both pressed the triggers, ...one would die, and one would remain alive. `
`The match would end. `
`George and Jessica wouldn't know the result until that moment came. `
`...However, was it really impossible for the two holding the guns to know...? `
`The muzzle of Kanon's gun, which had already been fired, must have been warm. `
`And the muzzle of the other gun, which Shannon hadn't fired, should have been ice-cold. `
`So, perhaps the pair of them... `
`did realize which gun was which. `
`...And yet, ......both expressions were solemn, `
`......the faces of those who would believe in their fate unswervingly until the moment the triggers were pulled. `
`"............" `
`"............" `
`"Don't be sad. `
`We'll meet again soon...in the Golden Land." `
`"We should've done this much sooner." `
`"If only we had, ...our reunion could've been avoided entirely." `
`"It's all right. `
`Considering what day this is, even this duel is just a farce." `
`"You're right... `
`If we're just going to revive in the Golden Land anyway, it really is just a farce." `
`"Then I'll see you later." `
`"Yeah. You too." `
`"So long." `
`"Kanon-kun?!?!" `
`"Hey, what's going on?! `
`Hang in there!!" `
`Suddenly, `
`...Kanon fell to the floor as if he'd had an attack of anemia. `
`It had happened without any warning beforehand, so everyone rushed up to him in alarm. `
`What they saw surprised them. `
`There was a single strand of blood across his forehead, making it look as though it had cracked open... `
`"...H-Huh? `
`H-How..." `
`"What happened? `
`...Wh-What's going on...?" `
`Trying to get a look at the wound, Gohda wiped Kanon's forehead with a handkerchief. `
`...However, his forehead was perfectly smooth, without any trace of a wound. `
`And yet, ...blood was pouring out, almost as though it was seeping through his skin... `
`"Wh-What are you doing?! `
`Stop the bleeding already!!" `
`"B-But...!! `
`E-Even though there's no wound, `
`...the blood... `
`...the blood won't stop coming...!" `
`"Hang in there, Kanon-kun!! `
`Kanon-kun!! `
`......Y-Yoshiya-kuuuuuuuuuun!!!" `
`"............" `
`Kanon's forehead was pale, ...and though his eyes were open, they had lost the light of the living. `
`...Just like... `
`...a puppet whose strings had been cut, `
`...he had passed away... `
`"Yoshiya-kun, Yoshiya-kun!! `
`Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, uwaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!" `
`"......So long, Kanon-kun. `
`...And...thank you." `
`Jessica dashed up to Kanon's corpse, `
`...held it, `
`...pressed her forehead against his, `
`and, as the still-hot blood was smeared over her forehead as well, `
`...she sobbed... `
`"......Shannon..." `
`"...George-san, `
`...we've...won. `
`...Now, `
`...I finally have the right... `
`...to love you..." `
`Finally... `
`Shannon...leaned against George's chest, ...as though the strings holding her up had been cut. `
`George held her in silence... `
`"Yoshiya-kun, Yoshiya-kun!! `
`Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh......!!! `
`Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...aaahh...aahh..." `
`There was nothing in the golden rose garden except the wind that carried golden flower petals... `
`and the sound of Jessica's grieving sobs... `
`"...Is your trial for us finished now?" `
`"It is. `
`...Congratulations. `
`You two were the ones who remained." `
`"We will give you our blessing. `
`But please, don't forget. `
`You are now responsible for nurturing your love." `
`"...Please, take good care of the seed of love that this miracle has created." `
`"......Of course. `
`...I swear it to her and you two." `
`"And now, let Shannon have the miracle of magic." `
`"Now, your soul will become Human. `
`You will become a single person." `
`""Gather, incomplete souls...!! `
`Become one and know love...!!"" `
`When Zepar and Furfur faced the heavens and yelled, `
`...the miracle of love... `
`...gathered the souls around Shannon. `
`They came from the losers of the trial. `
`From Kanon, who had been defeated. `
`And from Beato, who had dropped out. `
`Slowly, ...the bodies of the two began to break down into flecks of gold dust... `
`"...What is......" `
`"Wh-What's going on here...?! `
`No one ever said that the losers would disappear!!" `
`As she yelled, Beato the Elder supported the body of her fading little sister. `
`However, the two demons were smiling quietly. `
`"Kanon has disappeared because he died. `
`Beato was born to love Battler and is disappearing because she has lost the qualifications to do that." `
`"...It is quite fair. `
`If you had survived, the other two would have vanished." `
`"Hang in there, little sister, hang in there!! `
`Weren't you going to solve Battler's closed room and save him?! `
`What are you doing, getting finished off in a place like this?!! `
`You call yourself a part of our complete form?!!" `
`"......Why... `
`...was I born... `
`...for the purpose of loving Battler-san...? `
`...Why... `
`...do I love Battler-san...? `
`The truth is... `
`...I don't know... `
`why I started to love him." `
`"...Wh-Whaat?! `
`Why are you saying this now...?!!" `
`"...After all, `
`...when I was born, `
`......I was told to love Battler-san and be loved by him... `
`...That was my purpose. `
`......So, `
`...I don't really know... `
`...why I love him..." `
`"P-People don't need a reason to love each other!! `
`Don't disappear!! `
`If you disappear, who will save Battler?! `
`Little sister, Beato! `
`Beatriiiiiiiiiiiiice!!" `
`......Why... `
`...is it... `
`that I love Battler-san...? `
`{a:c: `
`...'Mother'?} `
`Well, `
`I'm actually not a big fan of the family-oriented type of girl. `
`You see how crude I am, right? `
`...I just can't handle acting politely in front of girls, ladies first and all that stuff. `
`...So, if I had to say what type I liked... `
`...Well, I'd probably like a Jessica-ish girl. `
`If I'm crude, why shouldn't she be too? `
`...It'd probably be just perfect to have a rough, relaxed relationship, where we could mess around without worrying about gender and be rude with no worries...! `
`So, if I ever get a girlfriend, `
`...I hope it's someone I can joke around with all the time...! `
`Huh? `
`What would she look like? `
`Can't say I care much either way. `
`Well, if she did happen to be a glamorous woman, blonde and bouncy with blue eyes like in Western films, `
`ihhihihihihihi, that'd be awesome. `
`I'd love to rub those boobs. `
`Wahahahahahaha...!" `
`{a:c:——Beatrice. `
`{n}Listen. `
`{n}I am giving you my love for Ushiromiya Battler. `
`{n}Become the kind of woman Battler wants.} `
`{a:c:Take the golden hair he likes. `
`{n}Take the blue eyes he likes. `
`{n}Take this personality that matches his. `
`{n}And then, ...you must love him in my place. `
`{n}And then, if possible, you must be loved by him.} `
`{a:c:I...can no longer love him. `
`{n}Please, take my feelings that went unfulfilled, `
`{n} ...my feelings that I couldn't hold back, `
`{n}...and make my wish come true.} `
`{a:c:From this day forward, you are no longer the Rokkenjima ghost that lives only to play pranks.} `
`{a:c:From this day forward, you will become the master of this island and wait for the day that he comes to fulfill his promise.} `
`{a:c:From this day forward, you will do this in my place. `
`{n}So, from this day forward, you will no longer be me.} `
`{a:c:Please forgive me for pushing all of my worries onto you, ...while I alone try to find happiness.} `
`{a:c:From this day forward, you have the right to hate everything. `
`{n}From this day forward, you are the Golden Witch, Beatrice.} `
`{a:c:And, one day... `
`{n}You will destroy everything, revive everything. `
`{n}...You will bring blessings to all lovers.} `
`{a:c:When that happens... `
`{n}...I pray that you and I...will both succeed in finding happiness.} `
`{a:c:From this day forward, you will no longer be me. `
`{n}From this day forward, I will no longer be you. `
`{n}The two of us will split apart a single soul and share it. `
`{n}And though, of course, neither of us will possess a complete soul... `
`{n}I'm sure our dreams will be more numerous than those of humans.} `
`{a:c:Let us be blessed... `
`{n}My dear...Beatrice...} `
`{a:c:No one will be able to see your form. `
`{n}However, I alone can see you. `
`{n}And if you are loved by many people... `
`{n}I'm sure that everyone will be able to see you someday.} `
`{a:c:With love, they will be able to 'see' us...} `
`"......Yoshiya...kun......" `
`"...A- `
`Are we... `
`...dre... `
`dreaming...?" `
`"...I-Insane... `
`What kind of joke is this...?? Well?!" `
`"G-G-Get Doctor Nanjo!! `
`Call Doctor Nanjo here...!!" `
`"......Gohda, `
`...that is enough." `
`Genji, who had been calm and silent through the whole thing, finally spoke. `
`And, ...his were the most reasonable words spoken. `
`...If they called Nanjo here, `
`...then what...? `
`Not only was there no arm to take the pulse of, `
`...there wasn't even a forehead to feel the heat of. `
`...Like leftover snow on a spring day, `
`...Kanon's form had been... `
`...By now, `
`...not even a trace remained. `
`His form... `
`...had sparkled with a spray of gold, `
`...vanishing completely... `
`"...Where...? `
`Where did he go?! `
`Where's Yoshiya-kun?! `
`Yoshiya-kun, Yoshiya-kuuuuuuuuuuun!!!!" `
`"......So long, `
`Milady. `
`...No, ......Jessica." `
`"...Kanon-san..." `
`"By now, no one's eyes can see us. `
`...That means that we're no longer in their world. `
`...However, we are right here." `
`"......You're right. `
`...We...are here." `
`"For us, a body is nothing more than a cage made of flesh. `
`...There's no need to be sad." `
`"...But, ......I do feel sad for her. `
`...For Jessica-san..." `
`"This is all...my sin. `
`...This is why furniture isn't supposed to love." `
`"......What will you do now?" `
`"Though I have lost my form, `
`...though I can no longer talk to her, `
`...and even though if Jessica ever talks to me, `
`...I can do nothing except nod behind her back, `
`...I will be by her side." `
`"...... `
`...I think that's wonderful." `
`"What will you do...?" `
`"...I want to save Battler-san...from a closed room..." `
`"A closed room...? `
`Ha, ...hahahahahahahaha." `
`After looking a bit taken aback, Kanon laughed gently. `
`Beato, who hadn't expected to be laughed at, looked a little sour. `
`"Wh-Why are you laughing...? `
`This is very important to me..." `
`"But it's a closed room. `
`...That's something for humans with bodies to worry about, right?" `
`"...Huh? `
`......Ah..." `
`"We've already been released from our cage of flesh. `
`...How could a closed room hinder us?" `
`"...A-Are you sure about that...? `
`I mean, there's a chain lock, and packing tape seals, and red truth...!" `
`"I see. `
`...So, you aren't a being from the world of pieces, ...but a higher-level world. `
`...That means your limitations are different from ours, or so I hear. `
`...Ah, well." `
`Kanon stretched. `
`...It looked as though he was about to head out somewhere. `
`"...Kanon-san..." `
`"Seeing as you're a fellow loser, `
`......okay. `
`I'll go for you. `
`I'll go to the guest room in the mansion, let Battler-sama out, `
`set the chain behind me, and hide in the closet in his place. `
`...Is that enough?" `
`"I-I'm glad for the sentiment... `
`However, even if you wanted to leave the cousin room, ...because of Erika-san's seals..." `
`Unlike the next room over, the cousin room containing Kanon was a guaranteed, complete closed room, even counting the windows. `
`Not only did he have no way to save Battler, he couldn't even escape himself... `
`"......In that case, use your magic to give me power." `
`"My...magic...?" `
`"Yeah. `
`Use your magic on me." `
`"W-Wait... `
`I don't even know how..." `
`"Aren't you Beatrice, the Golden Witch...?" `
`"I am a witch, but......ummm... `
`I don't even know about closed room tricks, much less magic..." `
`"*sigh*... `
`Okay, listen up, Beatrice. `
`...I'll only tell you this once. `
`This is what a witch is." `
`"What a witch is......?" `
`{a:c: `
`A witch is...} `
`"Not the one who solves puzzles." `
`"...Not the one...who solves puzzles...?" `
`"Yeah, that's right. `
`If you're a witch, why are you clutching at your head because of someone else's puzzles? `
`...That's not a witch's job, right?" `
`"...Th-Then...what is...a witch's job...?" `
`"The Golden Witch I know... `
`would have used insane magic to create a puzzle that no one could understand, confusing everyone and sneering. `
`...Create a horrible riddle that no one can get, spin everyone around, and bad-mouth them. `
`You aren't supposed to clutch at your head worrying about your opponents' puzzles. That's your opponents' job." `
`"Worrying...is my opponents' job..." `
`"Don't worry about how Ushiromiya Battler got out of the closed room. `
`...A chain lock closed room? `
`How trivial. `
`...You need to create a much more spectacular, ultimate closed room... `
`and make it so that they're the ones worrying. `
`......I'll even lend a hand." `
`"I'm...not the one who worries..." `
`"That's for them to do. `
`It's about time they learned the true terror of the Golden Witch Beatrice, `
`the one who can create endless closed room tricks of the most horrific kind, `
`tricks that can make even the demons of hell prostrate themselves in shock...!" `
`"...A closed room...even more horrific than Battler-san's..." `
`"We've already gotten our hands on one, haven't we?" `
`"A...horrific...closed...room..." `
`{a:c:
`...Ah...} `
`In the back of Beato's mind, `
`...images she remembered began to flit by, one after another... `
`...The mansion, the guesthouse, the rose garden... `
`Trick. Mistake. Lure. `
`Taunt. `
`Trap. `
`Laugh together. `
`...Do you know about this trick...? `
`I think I've seen something like it in a book before... `
`Beato's eyes opened wider and wider... `
`Countless lights circled around her, swallowing her up. `
`"And one more thing." `
`"...Wh-What...?" `
`"That's no way for the witch of closed rooms to talk." `
`"So, after all, {ruby:watashi:I} should..." `
`"Go for '{ruby:warawa:I}' instead. `
