`...I could hear the eerie sound of wind and rain. `
`Once again, I hazily regained consciousness on top of the bed... `
`The finger that the witch had bitten off... `
`was attached to my hand. `
`That's not to say that 'it was all an illusion', `
`but my finger was now attached. `
`...After all, the pain and the teeth marks as though a witch had bitten it... `
`...were still there. `
`And yet, the window, which I had supposedly smashed, had been fixed as though it had never been broken in the first place... `
`......How can I escape from this creepy room? `
`Why am I locked up in this eerie room...all alone...? `
`I want to get out. `
`...I have to get out. `
`...Please, let me out...... `
`...The door was sealed with a firm chain. `
`I could open it a crack, but only enough to peek out into the corridor at best. `
`Even getting just a fist through it would probably be hard. `
`The window wouldn't budge either. `
`It was no better than a barred prison window... `
`The bathroom didn't even have a window. `
`...The only thing that could get out of there...was the water that flowed out if you turned on the tap. `
`...No matter what I do, ...I can't think of a way out of here. `
`While shut up in a place like this, I truly am a prisoner. `
`Unless someone comes from outside to save me, ...I won't be able to get out for all eternity. `
`......In that case, can't I just call for help? `
`Yes, the tiny gap I can make in that door must exist so that I can call for help. `
`But...can I make the words come out...? `
`Earlier, I tried to call out for help, `
`but for some reason, the words couldn't escape my mouth. `
`...Maybe I was just confused. `
`I might've lost my voice in my haste and confusion. `
`I'll open the door and make that crack appear one more time. `
`The warm light of the hallway flowed in, making the darkness of the room stand out all the more... `
`Though I couldn't hear any voices, I did feel something peaceful. `
`...I'm sure everyone's in the room at the other end of the hallway, chatting happily about something. `
`If I can just call out, surely someone will come to save me... `
`"......Haah, ......haah, ......nng..." `
`Holding back some indescribable fear, I tried yelling once more... `
`"......!! `
`......!!! `
`.........!!!!" `
`But the result was the same. `
`It was like trying to yell underwater. `
`...All I did was get out of breath, unable to call out in the slightest. `
`"......Haah!! `
`Haah, ...haah, ......haah......" `
`Even though I could say as much as I wanted if I just grumbled to myself inside the room, `
`...whenever I tried to make my voice reach outside, I choked and was unable to say anything. `
`I understand. `
`...My body isn't the only thing locked up in this eerie closed room. `
`...My voice is too... `
`Thinking that I could use some other kind of sound to call for help, I tried opening and closing the door violently, making the chain rattle. `
`It does sound as though it's clanking noisily, ...but it's surely no good. `
`Even this sound...is being locked inside this closed room. `
`No matter how harsh a sound I make, ...I'm sure it'll be quieter than a leaf falling by the time it reaches the other end of the corridor... `
`I tried using the hateful chain that sealed the door to make a sound to call for someone, `
`but that only deepened my despair... `
`"......? `
`...This......chain...?" `
`That's insane... `
`Just a second ago, it was a stiff chain that looked like it might be used to seal a monster away... `
`But at some point, ...... `
`it had transformed into a normal chain lock. `
`This changes everything. `
`Now I can just undo it from the inside...! `
`I tried to undo it, but the chain wasn't long enough for that while the door was still open a crack, and I couldn't get it off. `
`Obviously. `
`"...C-Calm down... `
`.........*gulp*..." `
`I gulped...and calmly closed the door. `
`Then, ...when I saw that the chain had slackened enough, ...I touched it with my finger to make sure. `
`...When I was little, ...I hated chains, because I could never get them undone right. `
`However, ...that was a long time ago. `
`Now, I can undo something like this. `
`...Anyone could, ...it's easy... `
`*clank*... `
`I imagined the demon who'd locked me in this room `
`using this as a trap to give me hope, just to make me despair even more, `
`...but I pushed those thoughts aside for the time being. `
`I undid the chain lock, `
`...and the chain dangled there right before my eyes. `
`...Now, `
`...there's no lock sealing this door. `
`Please, `
`...don't torment me anymore... `
`and just... `
`...open normally...! `
`...Slowly, ...the door opened. `
`When I closed the door to undo the chain, `
`...the warm light from the hallway got cut off. `
`If I open it again, what if that warm light is gone this time? `
`...I was even afraid of stuff like that. `
`However, that was...... `
`...just me over-imagining things. `
`Slowly, `
`...quickly...... `
`no, I guess this is normal for a door... `
`As the door let out an annoying creak, `
`......the exit from this cursed closed room finally opened... `
`"......!! `
`.........!!!" `
`Ha...hahaha, I did it...I did it...! `
`Even my cry of joy was strangled. `
`...But that doesn't matter anymore. `
`All that matters is that I can get out! `
`I poked my head out and looked left and right down the corridor. `
`The warm corridor. `
`I could sense people having fun at the other end. `
`...Everyone's right there. `
`Let's go, right now. `
`"......Gyeh......?!?!" `
`At that moment, something cold and heartless crushed my throat. `
`It was as though an iron loop had been fastened around my neck and pulled on hard from behind. `
`No, ...not 'as though'. `
`...Without my knowing, `
`...at some point, `
`...a thick, metal collar had been fastened around my neck. `
`When did this happen?! `
`When I turned around, I despaired even more. `
`Out from the inner side of the door I had just opened, `
`...a thick chain had extended... `
`and attached itself to this collar I was wearing. `
`I pulled on it, but it didn't even budge. `
`When I shook it, the whole door creaked. `
`...What... `
`...th... `
`...the hell... `
`The chain that connected to my collar...was attached to the inner side of the door. `
`Yes. `
`The same vanishing chain that had secured the door a short while back...had suddenly become a chain holding me in place... `
`That's insane, ...that's insane...!! `
`Dammit, what's going on here?!! `
`I pulled with all my strength, trying to tear the whole door off, `
`but I already knew from repeated experiments that it wouldn't even budge. `
`...I'm sure this chain will disappear once I go back inside the room. `
`But it'll never let me leave that room. `
`Though it had apparently turned back into a normal chain lock, ...nothing had actually changed. `
`'The chain lock' still bound me to that room... `
`"...Uuu......nnngh.....aaaaaaaaahhhh...!!!" `
`Tears flowing down my face, I pulled with all I had. `
`...It was completely useless. `
`No matter what I did, I'd never tear it loose. `
`And I wasn't even permitted to call out for help. `
`...I felt a confused anger at how the demon had mercilessly made me think that I'd escaped for just an instant. `
`But no matter how much I yelled, no voice came out, and no one on the other end of the corridor could hear me... `
`Then, `
`......I noticed... `
`...an odd stain on the wall of the corridor. `
`It wasn't a stain. `
`...They were letters, traced out by a finger that had been covered in red paint. `
`"......?! `
`......?!?!" `
`Those letters, ...which looked like they'd been drawn in blood, `
`answered my biggest question... `
`The chain lock must be set. `
`You're allowed to unset it, but it must then be reset. `
`Unless it is set, this exit of yours will be unusable. `
`I instantly understood the meaning of that ominous message. `
`Then I tried it out, and understood completely. `
`When I returned to the room and reset the chain lock, ...the collar around my neck disappeared. `
`When I undid the chain lock again, ...that heavy feeling around my neck returned. `
`In other words, I cannot leave this room while the chain lock is still unset. `
`In that case, why don't I just set the chain while outside the room...?! `
`I undid the chain one more time. `
`The collar and chain appeared around my neck again. `
`I stepped out into the corridor and closed the door behind me, leaving only the slightest of cracks. `
`I stuck my hand through that crack, grabbed the dangling chain, and tried to reset it somehow. `
`...D-Dammit... `
`...Even though it was so easy to do from the inside, `
`...why... `
`is it so hard to do from the outside...? `
`The gap needed to be wide if I wanted to manipulate the chain well. `
`However, that made the chain too short to reach. `
`To make the chain reach just a bit further, I'd have to close the door a little bit more. `
`But if I do that, there won't even be enough of a gap to fit my hand in. `
`...Of course, that was perfectly natural. `
`Chain locks are made to be used from the inside. `
`They'd be completely pointless if you could set and unset them from the outside. `
`That's why the length of the chain is specially chosen `
`to prevent anyone from setting or unsetting it from the outside. `
`Then, can I use some kind of hard and thin tool? `
`If the gap of the door is just a finger's width across, that's more than enough for the chain to reach. `
`...If I could just bend a wire hanger so that it fits through the crack... `
`and work the chain with that... `
`That's right, there's a closet just to the side of the door. `
`Could there be some hangers in there? `
`"......Found one...!! `
`O-Ooh, thank God...!!" `
`A single, cheap-looking hanger, like one you might find in a laundry room, was hanging there. `
`...Really? `
`I'm pretty sure that when I last looked a short while ago, `
`...nothing like this was in the closet... `
`Ah, who cares...! `
`Quickly, ...quickly...!! `
`I twisted the wire hanger, bending the end with the tip around. `
`I formed a loop at the end to grab at things with, `
`...making for a sort of burglar's tool. `
`I then dashed out into the corridor again and closed the door almost as far as it would go. `
`My wrist could never pass through this. `
`However, if I close it this much, the chain should have extra length to spare...! `
`And this crack is large enough for me to stick the hanger through...! `
`Now it's just a matter of technique...! `
`If I keep trying, I'll definitely be able to do it eventually, ...I'm certain of it!! `
`"......Hah......haah...`...haah......haah...!" `
`It's harder than it looks... `
`...But the chain is long enough. `
`...It isn't impossible...! `
`I had finally gotten my hands on the one way to escape. `
`...It was hard, yes, but it was theoretically possible. `
`If it's possible, I'll be able to get out. `
`I'll be able to escape from here...!! `
`"...Hihi...hihihihihihihihihi..." `
`"...! ...?!?!" `
`At that moment, ...I felt a heavy weight on the far side of the door. `
`It felt as though someone inside the room had pressed their forehead against the door... `
`and was drawing closer. `
`And she... `
`...the witch... `
`...had laughed. `
`Then, I felt a powerful and strange force on the wire hanger. `
`...Is she trying to grab it away from me?! `
`Yeah right, like hell I'll let go!! `
`Like hell I'll let my one key out of here get stolen while my guard's down!! `
`Fortunately, I'd stuck my wrist through it so that I wouldn't drop it if my hand got tired. `
`You won't be able to snatch this out of my hands...! `
`""Hihihi, hihihihihihihihihi......"" `
`The witch on the other side of the door laughed at me... `
`Then, ...I noticed something weird. `
`I looked at my left hand, which I had pressed against the door to hold it in place, `
`...and between the fingers of that hand, `
`...I could see something red. `
`......They were... `
`...red...letters. `
`I realized immediately. `
`At some point in time, even more bloody letters had been drawn on the door, `
`and my left hand had been covering them up. `
`Still fighting against the vice-like strength of the witch beyond the door, ...I moved my left hand to the side. `
`Where that hand had been, `
`...bloody letters had indeed been drawn. `
`And there, ...as though someone had predicted that I'd struggle this way from the very beginning, `
`...was a message from the witch to me. `
`It is impossible to set or unset the chain lock from the outside `
`by any means. `
`All tricks done from the corridor...had been sealed by the red letters. `
`"...N-No way......" `
`"Hihihihihihihi. `
`...Hihhihhihhihhihhihhihhihhi...!!" `
`There was suddenly a terrible sound, and the force pulling on the hanger was suddenly released. `
`Then, ...when I pulled it out and looked, ...I lost all hope. `
`As though it had been hit by the acid of the room's darkness, `
`...the tip of the hanger... `
`had burnt and bubbled... `
`and melted off. `
`Now it's pitifully short. `
`This can't be used for anything...! `
`It would be useless to search for a substitute. `
`...All schemes to set the chain from the outside...have been prevented...! `
`Dammit... `
`...dammit, dammit, dammit...!! `
`I threw the remnants of the wire hanger against the floor, `
`...faced the hallway filled with a warm light, `
`...and called for help. `
`However, I just choked, unable to speak at all. `
`Everyone's just down the corridor. `
`And everything's peaceful there! `
`I can't hear their voices, but I know! `
`I'm sure they're all having a good time playing cards! `
`Please, someone notice!! `
`Someone, ...save me!!! `
`Hi...hihihihihihihi... `
`...hi `
`hi `
`hihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!! `
`Aaaaaaaahgggyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh...!!! `
`"""...Ahahahaha, hahahahahahahaha.""" `
`This time, it wasn't the witch's voice. `
`...It was the happy voices of everyone else, which I could hear coming from the other end of the hallway... `
`Someone, come over here... `
`...and save meeeeeeeeeeeee... `
`"Sorry, but I'm out!" `
`George slammed his last card down, ending the game with his victory once again. `
`Everyone gasped in unison. `
`The cousin room was filled with laughter as they enjoyed their card game... `
`"Whoooooooa, so you really did have it, George-aniki! `
`Damn you...damn you six of spaaaaadeeessss!" `
`"Your eight of diamonds was pretty nasty too, Battler. `
`Aah, I was so close, ahahahahaha!" `
`"Uu-uu-uu-!! `
`You're incredible, George onii-chan! You won again!!" `
`"Yep, looks like we've won again. `
`Ahahahahaha." `
`Maria couldn't really hold her own in an all-out battle. `
`So, she had teamed up with George, which was why she was celebrating his victory. `
`"...Nngg...... `
`...Utter defeat." `
`Kanon winced and let his cards drop to the table. `
`The game of sevens between Kanon and the cousins had been a fierce battle. `
`Normally, they would take things easy since Maria was there, so this sort of game was rare. `
`Kanon had started taking the game seriously, unwilling to lose, `
`so George and Battler had responded and the battle had grown fierce. `
`Unlike Battler, who was carefree enough to enjoy it whether he won or lost, Kanon's mood changed drastically with every victory and defeat. `
`...It was less of a dislike for losing and more that he just wasn't used to playing. `
`He wasn't used to trading a few wins and losses with his opponents, `
`so he took even losses within a game seriously. `
`Since he had resolved to win and had unfortunately challenged the veteran players George and Battler, `
`the result was plain to see. `
`As Kanon slumped his shoulders, Jessica slapped him on the back. `
`"Hey, you almost had it...! `
`Ahaha, I love `
`fighting all-out like this!" `
`"...Whether you go all-out or not, if you just lose in the end, it's all pointless..." `
`"That's not true. `
`If you really gave it your all, there's no reason to get all depressed when you lose. `
`If you lost after hardly trying, then you'd be grumbling and complaining about how you would've won if you'd taken it seriously, right?" `
`"That's right. `
`People who really give it their all never complain. `
`They're always cheery no matter what the result is." `
`"You're right. `
`And they can be scarier than anyone else. `
`They always learn something from their experience and grow." `
`"...Very true. `
`...I was a coward, so I could never learn anything. `
`...I see that I am still immature." `
`I am furniture, so any dreams I might have are pointless. `
`Because he'd rigidly believed that, he'd distanced himself from everything, shutting himself away. `
`However, during that same time, Shannon had undergone many life adventures. `
`And now, her hand was resting on the door separating furniture and Humans... `
`The old Kanon would only have seen this card game as a way to pass the time. `
`However, ...the new Kanon was now capable of gaining something new from this experience. `
`That's probably...what it means to grow. `
`Furniture does nothing but rot with the passage of time. `
`The ability to grow...is a privilege given only to Humans. `
`"Thanks for playing with us. `
`You probably had work to do, like filling in the log, right...? `
`I'm really glad you decided to hang out with us." `
`"...Don't worry about it. `
`I had a lot of fun too. `
`...Or should I say...that I've realized that this sort of thing is fun. `
`Thanks for pushing so hard for me to come." `
`"Let's challenge ourselves more and more. `
`And let's go and find more and more things you didn't know about. `
`...O- `
`Oh, `
`by the way, `
`about what we were talking about earlier... `
`E-Ever wanted to try playing guitar? `
`W-Well, I don't want to force you or anything, but..." `
`"......It must be very difficult." `
`"Y-Yeah, I guess. `
`But I'll do a good job teaching you, and I'll even practice with you. `
`Well, I guess I'm not that much of an expert myself, hahaha..." `
`At first, Kanon was scared that he might make a complete fool of himself if he touched a musical instrument for the first time in his life. `
`...After all, he knew that screwing up like that would make him feel bad. `
`...However, Kanon was starting to learn. `
`"It's only natural that I'll be bad when I first start. `
`...If I try to run away from it, I'll never learn a thing for all eternity. `
`I'll never achieve anything." `
`"That's right. `
`Isn't that why people love it when they feel themselves improving? `
`Even I sucked at making my left and right hands move at the same time when I first started...! `
`But I slowly got the knack of it, and it started to feel more and more natural...!" `
`"......... `
`...I'd like to reach that level too. `
`If one path to that goal is playing music with you, Milady, ...I would love to do that with you." `
`"R-Really...?!" `
`"Yes. `
`...I'm sure I'll be horrible when I start, and I might even make you lose hope in me at times. `
`...But if I've given it my all, even messing up is no big deal. `
`...That's what I learned from you all just now." `
`"...Hahahahahahaha, `
`you're embarrassing me..." `
`"I......love you more than ever, Milady. `
`Because I averted my eyes for so long, even though you shone like the sun, `
`I never noticed you when you were right there next to me..." `
`"Heheheh. `
`Then I'd better work even harder to make you love me even more... `
`Hehahah, hahyahyahya..." `
`Kanon's serious and competitive words were more than enough to make Jessica shy. `
`However, Kanon's expression unexpectedly clouded... `
`"...Milady, the reason I love you is so clear. `
`...Because of that, I can't bear not knowing." `
`"N-Not knowing what...?" `
`"...Why did you start to like me? `
`......Unlike you, I don't shine in any sense. `
`...Even now, I'm just clinging to your back as you shine the way. `
`...I can't think of any reason why you would love someone as shabby as me." `
`"...Th-That's not true, okay?! `
`There are all kinds of good things about you, Kanon-kun..." `
`"...Let me swallow my pride and ask. `
`...What about me made you like me, Milady?" `
`Kanon hung his head. `
`...Since he had never learned anything on his own, he had never been able to take the initiative with her in any way.. `
`The fact that he was accepting her affection one-sidedly, unable to do anything but simply receive it, `
`...made him sad...and frustrated at himself. `
`Jessica was lost for words. `
`...After all, compared to the reason that Kanon had started to love Jessica, `
`......Jessica's reason was a lot more vague. `
`She had heard Shannon talking about her love with George, `
`...and at school, she and her friends had always talked about relationships with boys. `
`There would have been nothing strange about a girl, fascinated by the idea of romance, developing an interest in a nearby member of the opposite sex. `
`...However, if you put that into words, `
`it might be misinterpreted to mean that any nearby boy would've done just as well... `
`However, ...she could still be proud of the feelings she felt at this very instant. `
`She really did love Kanon, ...and she truly wanted to experience romance. `
`As a result, they might end up together, or they might not. `
`However, if she reached that result without holding back, she could accept it no matter which it was. `
`That's why she was able to become serious and honest about how she felt. `
`However, ...she couldn't find the right words to tell Kanon this. `
`When Kanon saw Jessica bite her lower lip in frustration, `
`......he finally realized... `
`"...I'm such a fool." `
`"Huh?" `
`"What about me do you like? `
`...That very question is foolish. `
`It's proof that I'm not serious about myself, and that I haven't been able to understand even myself. `
`...It's horrible of me to try and make you say it for me." `
`"Th-That's not true...! `
`A-After all, it's the first question any girl would like to ask after being given a love confession...! `
`'What part of me do you like?'..." `
`"It was immature of me to ask you that. `
`How could anyone love someone so immature?" `
`"W-Wait, that's not..." `
`Jessica panicked, trying desperately to explain how she felt. `
`However, Kanon was calm. `
`And then, he spoke. `
`"In that case, `
`......I want you to love me... `
`the way I already love you. `
`...I've decided to start changing myself so that can happen. `
`I can hardly imagine that you would love me as I am. `
`...But someday, ...no matter what..." `
`"...Yeah. `
`I'm absolutely sure you'll become a wonderful person, Kanon-kun. `
`A guy so cool that I can't keep my eyes off you. `
`Until then, I'll stick by you all the way. `
`...We have plenty of time...!" `
`"......... `
`...But unfortunately, there isn't that much time left." `
`"...What do you mean?" `
`"...It usually saddens you when I talk about furniture. `
`...However, this is something I must tell you. `
`And it is also something I must fight for with all my soul." `
`"What are you talking about...? `
`I don't want to hear any more of that 'I'm furniture so I can't fall in love' talk. `
`You're a Human, not furniture...!" `
`"Yes. `
`I would like to become Human. `
`However, I am still furniture." `
`"In that case, just do it...! Become human...!" `
`"The witch taught me once. `
`...About the single element of this world. `
`According to her, it's love. `
`...It's something that Humans born into this world can take for granted. `
`...However, it is not something that those not from this world, who were born as furniture, can take for granted. `
`...In order to gain it for themselves, they must have magic or a miracle." `
`...In just the same way that Nee-san and George-sama... `
`...would never have ended up as they have without borrowing the power of that golden butterfly brooch. `
`"I don't really get that last part." `
`"...What don't you understand? `
`...Let me hear it." `
`"Since this game began, ...a large portion of the time has been spent on Shannon and Kanon's determination to fall in love. `
`...I've got no problem interpreting that as a story of growth and teenage determination for a girl and boy who call themselves furniture. `
`But one of the assumptions they make feels really out of place to me." `
`"......Why is magic necessary? `
`...Is that it...?" `
`"Both Shannon and Kanon...call themselves furniture. `
`...They've always claimed that there can't be love between furniture and Humans. `
`At that point, the magic of the golden butterfly brooch comes into play, and as the miraculous result of its magic, love is established between Shannon and George onii-chan. `
`That's what they claim." `
`"Might it mean merely that forbidden love between people of different classes `
`would be unmanageable without a miracle of magic...?" `
`"True. `
`I can accept that Shannon and Kanon, who are servants in forbidden love with members of the family and suffering for it, `
`might debase themselves by calling themselves furniture." `
`"...Then what is it that you cannot accept...?" `
`"'Without borrowing the power of magic once more, marriage will be impossible'. `
`...That seems to be a common understanding between Shannon and Kanon. `
`...I just can't understand that part." `
`After meeting in secret for quite some time, George and Shannon had finally gotten engaged. `
`Both were fully prepared for it emotionally, `
`and though there would be some trouble with the relatives, it would probably be impossible for anyone to prevent their marriage by this point. `
`"......Trying to stand between two who wish to be wed is as foolish as standing in front of an arrow and trying to catch it." `
`"Exactly. `
`Now that George onii-chan has sworn to protect his lover for the rest of their lives, he has no need to fear opposition and disinheritance from his parents. `
`...On the contrary, you might even consider that a perfect test of his love for her. `
`......In other words, they will be married, no matter what. `
`No one can stop them. `
`And they've both consented to the engagement." `
`"No one can stop them or impede them. `
`Trying to break apart lovers is a foolhardy venture..." `
`"Yeah. `
`And that's what's strange. `
`There's no need for magic." `
`If George and Shannon `
`had wanted Eva's approval for their engagement... `
`...Then magic might really have been necessary. `
`After all, Eva had forbidden his relationship with her. `
`No matter how much George spoke on Shannon's behalf, the chances of Eva being convinced were very near zero. `
`If that were the case, it would be understandable if they'd wanted a magical miracle to make Eva acknowledge that engagement. `
`"However, George onii-chan has already made an oath. `
`He doesn't care whether his parents approve of the engagement or not. `
`...Yeah. `
`There's nothing standing in the way of their engagement. `
`And Shannon should know that well herself. `
`So why is it that now, on this night where the proposal went so smoothly, she's still praying for a miracle of magic?" `
`"...According to the furniture, `
`she won't even have the right to marry without such a miracle..." `
`"And there you go. `
`It means that Shannon has accepted George's proposal, `
`...but she knows that there's still some kind of barrier that can't be overcome without a magical miracle. `
`And that barrier isn't something that they can overcome by their own efforts. `
`That's why they need this miracle called magic." `
`"Why do they need magic? `
`If two people love each other, what other miracle could they possibly need to be together?!" `
`"......Hmm, I see..." `
`Featherine listened to Ange's interpretation, smiling in a satisfied way. `
`...Apparently, she had already reached that conclusion and enjoyed watching Ange finally manage to do the same. `
`"And that same question applies to Kanon as well. `
`...The love between him and Jessica onee-chan has just begun, but their emotions are pure. `
`There's nothing standing in their way. `
`They're already in a loving relationship even without the golden butterfly brooch. `
`...The relationship they've started might easily last for years, eventually resulting in marriage. `
`There's nothing standing in their way either." `
`"...As long as they don't seek approval from Krauss and Natsuhi, it seems that they will not need a magical miracle either..." `
`"Exactly. `
`...Kanon watched how Shannon lived and changed his own way of life. `
`Then, he let his true feelings be known and started a relationship with Jessica onee-chan. `
`...There's no need for magic anymore." `
`"...If it were a one-sided love, then he might need a love charm or something. `
`But their feelings are already mutual. `
`They've already communicated their intentions to one another. `
`...So why do they still need a magical miracle?" `
`Both furniture were in relationships of mutual love. `
`There shouldn't have been any need for a miracle any longer. `
`So why... `
`...do they still desire some miracle? `
`And on top of that, the single brooch was portrayed as bestowing only a single miracle. `
`It felt almost as though Shannon was hesitating because, if she used up that miracle for herself, `
`Kanon's chances at love would be automatically sealed away for eternity... `
`"So this is the question: `
`why is furniture not allowed to love?" `
`"...So, you ask why love will not be permitted without the miracle known as magic." `
`"And also, `
`...though the furniture laments with such certainty that they're unable to love, this golden butterfly brooch is supposed to give them permission to do it. `
`Just what on earth is it?" `
`"Of course, it is a crystallization of magic. `
`However, like most magics, it can be burnt by the anti-magic toxin." `
`"...So, it can only have an effect for those who believe in magic and witches." `
`"Correct. `
`So, Shannon, who was capable of interacting with me, was able to make use of its benefits. `
`However, if Shannon had dropped it on a sandy beach, and someone who knew nothing picked it up..." `
`"...If that person was shrouded in the anti-magic toxin, they wouldn't be able to make use of the brooch's magic power..." `
`"Precisely. `
`A witch's magical items often lose their power if they are not handed over directly. `
`However, just as how a witch can manifest herself if her existence is acknowledged by a great many Humans and the anti-magic toxin disappears, `
`the power of that magical item can also be preserved if it is believed in by a great many Humans." `
`"That's ironic. `
`...No matter what kind of magic we witches give out, everything depends on whether the Human we give it to can accept it." `
`"I have heard that the same goes for medicine. `
`Even with the exact same medicine, Humans who know of the medicine's effect experience it to a greater degree." `
`"...Oh, I think I understand. `
`When taking cold medicine, I've gotten the feeling that it's more effective when you read the description on the bottle." `
`As she listened, Beato thought that magic sounded a bit like a ritual. `
`When most Humans think of magic, `
`they think of incredible miracles being performed one after another in front of a crowd of other Humans. `
`However, this true magic that the older sister spoke of sounded almost like a ritual, `
`something that has no effect if the person using it doesn't believe. `
`...Shannon's heart was captured by George bit by bit as he grew by leaps and bounds. `
`However, she had given up, thinking that one of a different class such as herself would never find love with him. `
`That was when Beatrice had given her the golden butterfly brooch and encouraged her. `
`Giving up means that you've got zero chance of success. `
`However, if the power of magic makes you think there might be some chance of your wish coming true, `
`then the odds of it happening are at least greater than zero. `
`Zero remains zero forever, so 'miracle' is a fitting word to describe even a faint chance coming into existence. `
`Humans can use magic to defeat 'resignation', `
`the process by which they themselves make their probability of success zero. `
`When a Human refuses to give up, though their chances of success may be small, those chances do exist. `
`And the more determined they become, the greater those odds rise. `
`It was easy to imagine Shannon making earnest wishes upon that brooch, believing in its effect, `
`...and trying little things over and over again to get George to like her. `
`"The power of belief becomes magic..." `
`"And those who make others believe are witches." `
`Those who make others believe... `
`...are witches. `
`...That's an interesting way to put it. `
`If you think about it, it's true. `
`Let's say a witch steps out into a spotlight, waves her staff in front of a crowd of onlookers, `
`and makes a rabbit appear out of thin air. `
`The many people who see it will surely assume it to be a sleight of hand. `
`They might wonder at how it was accomplished, but they'll surely say that it couldn't have been real magic, `
`and when they applaud, it will be for a splendid trick that only appeared to be magic. `
`But what if... `
`What if someone performed a sacred ceremony inside a great ancient temple in front of a crowd of believers... `
`and ended up with the exact same result? `
`...Would any of the people there think it was a sleight of hand? `
`In fact, in the ancient past, when magic tricks as a form of entertainment didn't even exist and divine spirits were worshiped, `
`this would doubtlessly have been a miracle of magic... `
`"I-In that case, `
`...could this here be... `
`...magic?" `
`"Aha. `
`Well now, what will be the first spell performed by the witch unable to use magic?" `
`"...H-Here I have an empty tea cup. `
`There is nothing inside it." `
`"Yes, it is empty. `
`*giggle* And then?" `
`"You take it, `
`...turn it like this, `
`...and place it upside down on the table." `
`"Heheheheheheh. `
`And then? What next?" `
`"Umm, `
`...l-let's both close our eyes and chant the incantation." `
`It was...the same magic that had been used to give Maria candies. `
`Beato the elder grinned and closed her eyes. `
`When she saw this, ...Beato slowly chanted the incantation. `
`"C-Come, try to remember. `
`...What was inside the cup?" `
`"Indeed. `
`Come, try to remember. `
`What was inside the cup?" `
`As she chanted, `
`Beato slowly opened her eyes and made sure that the older sister was repeating her with her eyes closed. `
`Then, a single gold butterfly appeared out of nowhere, `
`...fluttered down onto the overturned cup, and scattered away in a golden splash. `
`"May I open my eyes now?" `
`"......Y-Yes. `
`Please open your eyes and inspect the contents of the cup." `
`"Well now. `
`...Let us see how well your first bit of magic has performed." `
`Taking her time and dragging out the suspense a little, the older sister...lifted up the cup. `
`"...Aha." `
`"H-How is it...?" `
`When the cup was lifted up, `
`......there lay...a single golden rose petal. `
`"D-Does this count...as magic...?" `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*... `
`Yes, it does. `
`{p:41:You used magic to create a golden flower petal inside an overturned cup. `
`It was a splendid bit of magic}." `
`"'Without love, it cannot be seen'. `
`That much I understand." `
`"It may be viewed as a trick. `
`It may also be believed to be magic. `
`...It all depends upon the toxin of the individual..." `
`"Then again, ...while this can explain some of the magic that's been used in the past, it can't explain everything." `
`"To get back to the point, all this stuff about believing in magic and rituals... `
`It doesn't answer the question: 'What was this golden butterfly brooch, `
`which allowed the furniture, who strongly believed that they could not love, to finally find love?'" `
`"...If we blindly accept the story of those two Beatos as true, `
`...might we assume that magic had the power to cancel out their feelings of 'resignation'?" `
`"'Why mustn't furniture fall in love?' `
`'Why is the power of the magic brooch necessary?' `
`...Yes, it does seem at a glance as though what you and the Beatos are saying provides an answer, though a vague one. `
`However, let me say this as a Reader. `
`...I can't accept this as you've presented it." `
`"You cannot accept it, you say...?" `
`"...The tragedy those furniture are struggling to resist is way too big to be explained away by that. `
`I doubt they could reform their way of thinking just because they were given some charm for making relationships." `
`"It's true that the brooch gave Shannon the chance she needed to get together with George onii-chan, `
`but some time after that, she said she wanted to deepen their relationship without borrowing the power of magic, and she even tried to give the brooch back to Beato. `
`At that point, she supposedly rejected the miracle of magic for a time. `
`...So, why would that power be necessary again?" `
`"Well now... `
`...Perhaps there is no way to say it except that love and marriage are very different things." `
`Featherine laughed lightly. `
`...She had probably formed a theory of her own and was laughing at Ange, who hadn't reached it yet. `
`"Let me hear it. `
`What's your view?" `
`"I'd like to keep that to myself for just a while longer. `
`...And of course, watching you form doubts and let your mind race is one the joys of being read aloud to. `
`If I gave you my views, you would accept them and stop thinking. `
`Then, having you read aloud would be no fun." `
`"...So, you're having me read a mystery novel you already know the answer to, just so you can enjoy watching me blunder about." `
`"Well, I am the Witch of Theatergoing. `
`...If you wish to laugh at my bad taste, please do not hold back, my miko." `
`"'Wa ha ha ha.'" `
`"Pft, ...*giggle*giggle*, hahahahahahaha..." `
`I understand that part of magic is created by a believing heart. `
`And that magic probably permeates deep into the world of us Humans as well. `
`However, though it permeates so far, the power that dwells within magic is small. `
`Lots of people visit shrines to pray for success on tests. `
`However, people rarely credit such a visit as the reason for their success. `
`By itself, praying does little more than give one peace of mind. `
`In love, where even a small chance and a little bit of courage can result in major changes, `
`this power can sometimes bring about incredible transformations... `
`However, ......would something like that really be enough... `
`to change the insurmountable fate of furniture...? `
`In the past, when Shannon and George were brought together, I imagine that the brooch's magical power functioned as little more than a ritualistic charm. `
`However, by now, `
`the magical power that the furniture seek from that brooch... `
`...It's not something as vague as a ritual. `
`It feels much stronger, like {i:a whole different interpretation of magic}. `
`If you believe in a sleight of hand, it becomes magic. `
`...But that's no more than a child's trick. `
`And that only explains one part of magic. `
`They are...hoping for something. `
`They're hoping for something with much, much more power... `
`...For true magic, not a sleight of hand. `
`"...So then, `
`...just what kind of magic is the furniture expecting from that brooch...?" `
`"......A golden butterfly...brooch...?" `
`"There exists a magic charm that the Golden Witch Beatrice gave to Shannon in exchange for smashing a mirror, `
`and which made her love bear fruit. `
`...That's what this is." `
`From his pocket, ... `
`Kanon pulled a single wing from a gold butterfly. `
`Though it was a single wing, it was easy to tell from its shape that it had originally been part of something with a butterfly motif. `
`"The magic of this brooch gave Shannon the chance she needed to start her relationship with George-sama. `
`...However, before that magic was fully realized, she left it to me. `
`...So, thanks to the power of this brooch, `
`...I gained your affection, Milady." `
`"That's not true... `
`I started liking you because of my own honest feelings..." `
`"...Thank you very much. `
`...You are Human, so you do not believe in witches or magic. `
`It's only natural. `
`...However, as furniture created by magic, `
`my very existence here is proof that the miracle of magic exists." `
`"S-Sorry, `
`what are you talking about...?" `
`Jessica tried to make sense of Kanon's words. `
`However, she couldn't understand...and had to ask him to repeat it, wearing a stiff smile... `
`"...... `
`...Both Shannon and I... `
`need magic to succeed in love. `
`The key for that is this brooch. `
`...I stepped on it and crushed it, so we each have one part now." `
`The brooch had lost its power when it was split in half. `
`However, if it was ever joined together again, ...its magic would be revived. `
`It would revive the miraculous power that could join furniture and a Human together... `
`"However, a single brooch can only grant one person's wish. `
`...Only one of us furniture can be joined by this single brooch." `
`That was the final seed of love, a spark of love, which the old, shrilly-laughing Beatrice had sown. `
`The old Beatrice had said that humans tormented by this spark were like ripe fruit, ...which she crudely used for her own enjoyment. `
`However, the magic infused within this seed...was real. `
`It was the only crystallization of magic that the Golden Witch Beatrice ever left in this world... `
`Its glint...increased. `
`"Huh? ...Wh-What the...?!" `
`"It's okay. `
`...But please, don't look right at it. `
`It'll blind you." `
`"...A-Aaaaahhh...!" `
`The glint grew even stronger, shining like the sun. `
`Even without Kanon's warning, Jessica wouldn't have been able to stop herself from covering her eyes with her hands... `
`As the light grew stronger, ...a sound like the roar of the wind or the tide also grew in intensity. `
`The sound of the wind and rain outside had already been overwhelmed... `
`Jessica could no longer even stand, and she crouched on the floor... `
`A flood of sound and light... `
`Until it withdrew, Jessica could do nothing but moan... `
