`"Come on, it's okay now. Let's hurry." `
`"I-I hope Father likes sweet foods..." `
`"Oh yes, he does like them. `
`In fact, he seems to enjoy eating pretty much anything. `
`Hohohoho." `
`After waiting for the master of the room to be out, Beato and Kumasawa entered the study. `
`Then, they quickly cleaned up the books on the desk, set down the basket they had brought there, and opened it up. `
`Inside...were several cute cookies cut out in a butterfly shape. `
`They set out a pretty plate and neatly arranged the cookies on it. `
`It was the kind of subtle, conscientious touch that the recipient wasn't likely to even notice. `
`The whole arrangement was filled with that sort of feeling. `
`"I see you spare no efforts for the sake of your beloved Father." `
`"This is...the most I'm allowed to do right now." `
`"To think that I would give Battler cookies... `
`Why should I, the ruler of the night, do so much for a guest who comes so rarely?" `
`Then, the study door swung violently open. `
`It was Battler, with Genji by his side... `
`Battler's eyes went wide for a second when he saw Beato there, but his expression quickly went blank again. `
`"...What are you doing here?" `
`"Father, ...please excuse me. `
`I didn't come here to get in the way of your important game..." `
`"How were you able to get in here...? `
`Wasn't this room locked?" `
`"...My apologies. `
`They wanted to surprise you with a gift, so I lent them a key." `
`"See, have a look...! `
`Beatrice-sama baked these cookies with all her soul, hoping that you would enjoy them." `
`"Kumasawa-san and Genji-san taught me how... `
`I never knew Genji-san was so good at baking cookies." `
`"Hohoho. `
`He hasn't done it much of late, but long ago, Genji-san cooked all sorts of things. `
`He was especially good with sweets...!" `
`"Cookies...?" `
`"Y-Yes. `
`It's a gift for you, Father. `
`I sincerely pray for your victory in this important match..." `
`Battler looked at the plate on the study desk that was piled up with beautiful cookies and the message card of encouragement lying next to it, `
`......and his face twisted with a complex expression, which might have been one of sadness and might have been one of hatred... `
`"......Master..." `
`Genji urged him to consider saying some words of gratitude to Beato... `
`Battler understood. `
`...Anyone would be pleased to receive an act of kindness like this. `
`Even though he understood it logically, `
`...he couldn't help but give a small exasperated sigh. `
`"...Thank you, I'm very grateful. `
`...However, I don't like sweets. `
`Please take it away." `
`"...M-Master..." `
`"............" `
`"Don't make me say the same thing again. `
`...Clean it up and take it away." `
`"M-Master, couldn't you just try one bite...? `
`Beatrice-sama worked hard to make them for your sake..." `
`"...I appreciate the sentiment. `
`...I'm in the middle of a vital game right now. `
`This is the final game, `
`...and it's vital both for me... `
`and Beato as well. `
`So please. `
`Don't mess with my heart any more than is necessary." `
`"That's just too sad for her...! `
`I'm glad that you're grateful for her feelings, `
`but can't you show it by taking just one little bite...?!" `
`"......Father..." `
`Beato looked at Battler sadly. `
`...Battler hung his head to avoid her gaze. `
`The expression on his face caused Beato more pain than any he had shown her before... `
`"...... `
`...Kumasawa, please clean this up and take it away." `
`"Master...!!" `
`"........." `
`Kumasawa clung to Battler, but he turned his back to her... `
`"...My...apologies... `
`...Let's clean this up, Kumasawa-san..." `
`"I won't allow it. `
`By making this gift, Beatrice-sama gave it her all to try and support you in the only way she could. `
`To tell her to take it away without eating a bite yourself... How can you trifle with a woman so?!!" `
`"......Kumasawa." `
`"If you call yourself a man, `
`you should at least try a bite when a woman makes you a handmade snack!! `
`If you truly intend to crush a woman's feelings like this, `
`I, Kumasawa, will not back down even if it kills me! No I won't!!" `
`"...K- `
`Kumasawa-san, `
`...you've done enough for me already..." `
`"I won't allow it!! `
`Master, do you think they're poisoned or something?!" `
`"........." `
`...Yeah. `
`If Beato ever came to give me cookies... `
`...Of course I'd figure that she'd put some kind of crazy poison in them... `
`And she's asking me if I think there's poison in these? `
`Who would expect... `
`...that cookies piled up in such a neat and cute way... `
`...could possibly have something bizarre hidden inside them...? `
`And anyway, `
`...who could possibly imagine... `
`Beato `
`making something like this......? `
`Because of that, ...Battler couldn't bear to look at Beato's innocent reaction, `
`which was completely free from any malicious thoughts, like slipping poison into cookies... `
`Beato quietly started to clean up. `
`...Every now and then, she sniffled. `
`Kumasawa continued to glare at Battler, `
`but she then gave a small sigh and helped Beato clean up. `
`However, the hardness didn't disappear from her expression. `
`"......My apologies, Father. `
`...Please excuse me." `
`"Don't call me that..." `
`"........." `
`"Don't call me Father. `
`...Beato never called me that." `
`"...Y-Yes, as you wish... `
`...My apologies." `
`Hanging her head so low that her chin touched her chest, Beato hurried out of the study. `
`After giving Battler a look, Kumasawa chased after her. `
`Kumasawa threw the door open a bit violently, and the footsteps of the pair rapidly disappeared off into the distance... `
`"...... `
`...I may be his little sister, but I'm not sure how I feel about that." `
`"If she were anyone other than Beato, you'd think of him as a true enemy of women, is that it...?" `
`"...I don't have a clue why Onii-chan and Beato act so friendly together. `
`Right now, I think of Beato as our greatest enemy, the one we must defeat. `
`...Still, even so... `
`As a woman, ...I can't say I like how Onii-chan's treating her." `
`"And yet, I can understand Battler's feelings a little too. `
`...What a sad state of affairs." `
`I still don't understand what kind of antagonism or connection there was between them. `
`However, Onii-chan probably viewed Beato...as a friendly rival, if not something more. `
`Onii-chan's reason for defeating Beato isn't to destroy an enemy out of hatred. `
`...It feels like he wants to give a sincere answer to her questions. `
`Yes. `
`I can't deny the fact that their fight isn't based on hatred, `
`...but on a stronger emotion. `
`"......And on top of that, `
`...Beato really is something, to remain dedicated to Onii-chan all the more even after being treated so coldly. `
`I agree with the other, older sister Beatrice. `
`...I can't understand why she's so dedicated to Onii-chan." `
`"And, though it will only happen after changing over a thousand years, `
`that single factor that you don't understand will certainly be inherited by the Golden Witch Beatrice we know so well..." `
`"...Yeah. `
`I understand that. `
`...Learning about this Beato will eventually teach us something about that Beato. `
`...And that may be able to explain the greatest piece in this crazy game, if not the game board itself..." `
`"Such a mysterious witch..." `
`Though she said those words, Featherine wore a confident smile on her face. `
`Her sarcastic confidence, as though she already knew the answer, was unchanged. `
`"......Beatrice, `
`I want to ask you something." `
`"...Y-Yes, what would you like to know, Ange-san...?" `
`When Ange asked her question, Beato, who had been reading a Fragment book in the shadows of the library, jumped. `
`"...Why do you call Ushiromiya Battler 'Father'?" `
`"B-Because he created the piece that I am..." `
`"...In that case, why are you so dedicated to Ushiromiya Battler? `
`Is there some rule that pieces must obey the Creator that makes them?" `
`"There is no such rule. `
`...A piece is like a tool, ...or perhaps a knife. `
`...When used skillfully by the Game Master, they can be quite useful. `
`However, if you use them incorrectly, they can hurt you as well. `
`...Whether a tool is used as a tool or a weapon, that has nothing to do with the tool's own will. `
`It is merely the result." `
`"In that case, why are you so dedicated to Onii-chan? `
`It's almost as though...that's your goal as a piece." `
`"...Y-Yes. `
`...That is the goal that gave birth to me." `
`"Did Onii-chan, the one who gave birth to you, give you that goal?" `
`"That's not it. `
`...As the Game Master, Battler merely set 'a piece with that role' on the board. `
`...Also, the one who gave birth to this piece... `
`was the first Game Master and the one who created this game, Beatrice herself..." `
`"...Aaah, this is getting confusing. `
`...In other words, you keep calling Onii-chan 'Father', but he's not actually your father. `
`...You're just calling him that affectionately `
`because you feel obligated to devote yourself to him." `
`"...Y-Yes. `
`...I think that's true. `
`Father was the one who placed me on the game board. `
`If he hadn't, my piece would never have had a turn. `
`So, the fact I exist here right now and am able to devote myself to my goal...is all thanks to Father." `
`"...I see. `
`So that's why it makes sense for you to call him Father. `
`...In that case, who told you to devote yourself to Onii-chan? `
`...Ah, that must have been the first Game Master, Beato herself. `
`...Aaaahh, this is so confusing." `
`"You wish to ask her why she must devote herself to Ushiromiya Battler, correct? `
`However, she cannot give you that answer. `
`She was given nothing but the goal itself. `
`...Only the person who gave her that goal knows the reasons for which they did so." `
`"...I see. `
`'Consider that as well, child of man', right? `
`...So, that means you already have an idea and you're laughing at my confusion." `
`"*cackle*cackle* `
`You really are just perfect for my miko..." `
`"...I will...do anything for Father. `
`...My existence will bring Father happiness. `
`...That is my greatest pleasure. `
`...And......" `
`At that point, Beato hesitated. `
`"And? `
`And...what?" `
`"Y-Yes... `
`...And, `
`......if I could one day have Father acknowledge my efforts, `
`...it would be my greatest joy..." `
`"Pft......" `
`"......What the hell. `
`...If you only wanted to devote yourself to him, I'd say you're just another furniture of the witch, `
`...but you want him to acknowledge your efforts? `
`That's less like furniture and more like..." `
`Ange stopped mid-sentence. `
`...That's less like furniture and more like... `
`...you're just a girl... `
`...who loves Onii-chan. `
`......I don't...get it. `
`The driving force behind this Beato...is that of a girl who adores Onii-chan. `
`But then, what does that make her? `
`If the first Beato liked Onii-chan, then she should have adored him and devoted herself to him directly. `
`Why would she create 'a piece of herself', a separate entity, to do it...? `
`As it stands, ...even if she does attract Onii-chan's attention, it will be towards the piece version of herself, `
`not the creator who made that piece. `
`If I ever like someone, I'll probably want to do things for them. `
`But of course, I'd want to do those things myself. `
`After all, I would want him to notice 'me'. `
`It's a love that will always go unrewarded, no matter how devoted she is. `
`And she's doing this out of her own free will... `
`Beato's actions look no different from those of an average girl in love. `
`She's devotedly doing all she can for him, dreaming that her kindness will eventually be acknowledged. `
`...Why would Beato create a piece like this...? `
`Maybe putting it in romantic terms is a bit too confusing. `
`Let's try using food as an example. `
`This would be as pointless as creating 'a piece to eat food for you'. `
`No matter how much food your piece eats on your behalf, you won't get any less hungry, right? `
`You're the one who wants to eat. `
`There's no reason to have a piece do that in your place. `
`For most jobs in this world, you can get someone else to do it for you. `
`However, with love and food alone, there can never be any point to letting another person do it in your place. `
`That's right. `
`...This Beato was created as a 'piece'...because of an impossible reason... `
`...Though at a glance, she looks like just a normal girl, `
`......the more I know about her, the less I understand, ...like she's an imaginary number... `
`"...Father hates it when I call him Father. `
`...And the 'me' that Father desires...didn't call him by that name either." `
`"Right. `
`The former you spoke to everyone without even using honorifics." `
`"...... `
`However, ...simply possessing that knowledge doesn't mean I can refer to Father quite that informally. `
`...I'd like to give it my all...and start by calling him Battler-san." `
`"I'm surprised you haven't gotten discouraged after being treated so coldly." `
`"...Fath- `
`...no, `
`...Battler-san is in the middle of an important game right now. `
`His opponent is the formidable Lady Erika, piece of the Great Lady Bernkastel. `
`...It's no surprise that he was in a bad mood when I stepped in at a delicate moment in his game, `
`just as it was starting to reach a critical point, `
`...and called him by that name he doesn't want to hear..." `
`"............" `
`Apparently, Beato still wanted to devote herself to Battler, even after being treated in such a cold manner. `
`Though to an outsider, it might just look as though she's being snubbed, ...it doesn't faze her at all. `
`It truly is the blindness of a girl in love... `
`"...Or is it that I can't 'see' because I have no love?" `
`"At times, love does let you 'see' the unseeable." `
`Beato once again immersed herself in the Fragment book that the former Beato had written. `
`...She was trying to find something about the Beato that Battler desired. `
`Ange shrugged, as though saying 'well, I don't get it'. `
`Featherine laughed when she saw this, hinting that an 'innocent young woman' could never understand. `
`Ange grumbled something back unhappily. `
`Their exchange seemed to have had no effect whatsoever on Beato as she sat in the shadows of the library... `
`After chasing all the others out, ...only Battler remained in the study. `
`There was no color in this dimly lit room. `
`However, ...for just the short time that the plate of cookies had been placed there, `
`the room had seemed at least a little cheery... `
`Battler's gaze drifted over to the table, ...which no longer had anything on it. `
`When he did, the cookie plate that had been there until a second ago was revived. `
`However, ...it was an illusion. `
`Though the cookies could be looked at, they could not be touched, much less eaten... `
`If Battler wished, he could make it possible to 'touch them' or 'eat them', ...but it would be an empty sensation. `
`It would only give the touch and taste that Battler desired. `
`...He no longer had any way of knowing `
`what kind of cookies they had been. `
`"........." `
`On the reception sofa across from Battler, `
`...a cloud of gold butterflies slowly gathered... `
`and took the form of the old Beato. `
`"'Come ooon, have a bite{p:0:☆} It's not every day that I make these by hand...! `
`Have no fear, I'm confident in how well they've turned out.'" `
`"'Pu ku ku ku! `
`Hearing that from Milady makes them all the more dubious.'" `
`"...Seriously. `
`...Any cookies you made would obviously have some kind of strange poison in them." `
`"'How shocking that you should think so. `
`Even if I did put something in, it'd be no worse than the kind that does this and that to your other thing. `
`Uhyahyahya!'" `
`"'If you do that sort of thing all the time, Battler-kun will never agree to eat them.'" `
`"'Huh? Putting things in someone's food is pretty basic, isn't it? `
`Fingernails, bits of hair, magic charms, Fragments of love...heheheheheheheh! `
`What would you people put in?'" `
`"'Yes, ma'aaam!! `
`I wouldn't put anything in them! I'd just eat them all myself!'" `
`"'Obviously. Do you have to be so predictable?!!'" `
`"'Well, they say a girl's gotta grab by all three sacks{p:0:☆} The first one's the stomach, right? `
`Next comes the wallet, ...and what was the third one again?! *giggle*{p:0:☆}" `
`"'If I could catch a guy's attention, I'd want to make him sacrifice his body, heart, and soul to me! `
`That's why I pour all my power and affection into my cooking.'" `
`"'Heheh, in any event, making someone eat your food is probably a frontal attack that's gone unchanged throughout the ages.'" `
`"'Ridiculous. `
`How pathetic to think that you couldn't grasp a single man's heart without relying on such simple tricks.'" `
`"'Ooh? `
`Are you saying you've succeeded in grasping a man's heart, Onee-sama?'" `
`"'Battler, there's nothing weird in it, so have a biiite. `
`Don't think you'll ever get a chance to eat my handmade cookies again{p:0:☆}'" `
`......There probably won't...be another chance. `
`I slowly stretched my hand... `
`out to the illusion of the cookie plate... `
`and touched it. `
`Just before I did, it became a cloud of gold butterflies...and vanished into the darkness of the study. `
`The illusions of Ronove and Virgilia also disappeared. `
`...However, the illusion of Beato alone still remained on the sofa. `
`"...Is there something not to your liking?" `
`"......Are you trying to force me to say it out loud?" `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle* `
`...The more the new 'me' differs from the form you wished for, `
`...the more you're reminded that I can never be revived again, `
`...correct?" `
`"........." `
`"*cackle*cackle*! `
`If you let a good woman get away, you never get a second chance. `
`So, only now, you've finally realized what a good woman I was!" `
`"...Shut up. `
`If you never appear again, `
`...that'd be a relief." `
`"Hmph......" `
`Beato lay sprawled on the sofa and looked up at the ceiling. `
`Battler also turned his back and moved to the window. ...For a while, there was silence. `
`"I imagine you understand, but..." `
`"...I do understand." `
`"The 'me' you were expecting...has already disappeared." `
`"...I know. `
`...Even though that Beato is you without a doubt, ...she's a different being than the old you, `
`...and I can say with certainty...that you'll never revive again..." `
`"My soul, femininity, sparkling personality, and splendid character were cultivated over a thousand years spent as a witch. `
`Unless an exactly identical thousand years is traversed, nothing can become me. `
`And so, ...at the moment you decided to create me, my personal history was different." `
`"Yeah. `
`......That damn Bernkastel has already guaranteed that you'll never revive..." `
`"However, you still hope for it, don't you?" `
`"........." `
`"One day, the new 'me' will trip and land on her head, and all her memories of the past will be restored! `
`...You were hoping for something like that, weren't you? `
`Ahyahyahyahya! `
`A delusional plot like that wouldn't even pass in a light novel these days!" `
`"...Shut up. `
`...In the past, you also... `
`...You waited and waited... `
`...for me to remember... `
`...and take notice..." `
`"........." `
`"........." `
`Then, ...what is it? `
`Does this mean... `
`that our relationship... `
`is exactly the opposite of how it once was...? `
`"......Hmph... `
`...Well, at times, I did continue the game believing that you would eventually notice and remember, `
`that a miracle would occur." `
`"......How did it feel? `
`...How did it feel when you were playing with me?" `
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*... `
`As they say, look inside your own heart..." `
`"........." `
`...It hurts. `
`If only she didn't look so much like you, ...I would've kept my cool a little better. `
`"Well, do as you wish. `
`In the past, I toyed with you and tormented you. `
`...Now's your chance for revenge against me. `
`...The new 'me' will just wander about nervously, ignorant of everything. `
`You may boil or burn her as you see fit. `
`Perhaps doing so will ease your old hatred." `
`"......I would if it was you. `
`It'd probably make me feel a lot better. `
`...But... `
`......that Beato... `
`...isn't you." `
`"If it isn't me, who is it?" `
`"...It's someone very much like you, `
`......but not you." `
`"But even so, she most certainly is me." `
`"......True. `
`She is you, `
`...and at the same time, `
`...she's a different person." `
`"In that case, the new 'me' really has it rough. `
`She's being treated like a plaything in my place. `
`...*cackle*cackle* How truly pitiable." `
`"........." `
`That might...be the contradiction inside me. `
`The new Beato seems like a different person, so I can't accept her. `
`Even though I know she's a different person, ...she keeps reminding me of Beato's face. `
`"In that case, `
`...why not think of her as my daughter?" `
`"...Your daughter...?" `
`"She does share my blood, so consider her a daughter that closely resembles me. `
`After all, she is my double, but hasn't lived a thousand years, so calling her that is not incongruous." `
`"...True..." `
`"Imagine that I have died, left behind a daughter, ...and entrusted her to you. `
`Won't it become a little easier to deal with her that way?" `
`"That's actually a good analogy. ...It's unlike you." `
`"Do not jest. `
`That is my daughter. `
`She is the child I left behind after my death. `
`...You are free to press my likeness upon her. `
`You may also let loose your pent up resentment on her in my place. `
`...Making her bear my sins and torturing her as you please may calm your grudge. `
`If that doesn't match your tastes, you can also guide her down the right path so that she does not end up on the inhumane road that I have tread." `
`"...She was made to devote herself to you since the moment of her birth. `
`If you wish, you can mold her into any shape you desire. `
`......After a thousand years of miracles, she might even become me." `
`"...So, I could even strip her naked and drag her around with a chain, like you did to me once." `
`"*cackle*cackle* `
`Yes, at this point, even greater humiliation would be possible..." `
`...So, ...she is......your double... `
`...and... `
`your daughter..." `
`....huh..." `
`Yes, she is exactly the same person, the same piece, which was created once more by the rule called Beatrice. `
`However, when I'm unable to accept it that way, ...I can think of her as Beato's daughter, `
`...finding a clear guidepost for how to interact with her and smooth the uncertainty in my heart. `
`......Finally, `
`...I... `
`...I understand how cruel... `
`I was to her then... `
`My tears poured to the ground, ...and when I followed them with my eyes... `
`I noticed that a white business card had fallen onto the floor. `
`It was... `
`the message card that had adorned those cookies. `
`I rushed her, telling her to clean up and leave right away, which was probably why it had fallen to the floor unnoticed. `
`I picked it up... `
`...and read the message on it. `
`......It was... `
`extremely short, ... `
`pure, ... `
`and sincere. `
`It's so clear, ...that I should be able to read it. `
`...However, `
`...it's blurred with tears, `
`...and I can't... `
`...see anything...... `
`...The flood of light and sound slowly dissipated. `
`The silence that followed was not interrupted even by the sound of wind and rain outside that had once been present. `
`Both Jessica... `
`...and George... `
`...timidly opened their eyes... `
`...Where in the world... `
`...is this...? `
`It was a strange room they had never seen before. `
`It looked like a western-style smoking room. `
`...Its furnishings were stylish and expensive. `
`It felt like the room of some dignified person. `
`There was a set of black tea on the table...as well as a chessboard, which seemed to be halfway through a game. `
`However, there was something strangely out of place. `
`The black and white checkerboard pattern made it feel like chess, `
`...but it looked like a very similar yet totally different game that no one knew of. `
`And similar to how it both looked like chess and not like chess... `
`The furnishings of this room...no, the room itself... ...Though it seemed like a western smoking room, `
`...it also felt like something completely different... `
`"......J- `
`Just where... `
`is this place...?" `
`"...Jessica-chan and Kanon-kun... `
`...And Shannon? `
`Where's Shannon...?!" `
`"I'm right here, George-sama." `
`"And I am here. `
`...Milady, George-sama, `
`we apologize for bringing you to a place like this." `
`"...What on earth is going on? `
`...Just when Shannon took out something that looked like a butterfly wing...and it started shining..." `
`"Th-The same thing happened to me...! `
`Kanon-kun took out this golden butterfly brooch thing, it started to sparkle, and..." `
`"Milady, George-san, first off, please allow us to apologize. `
`And please stay calm. `
`...Something strange is about to happen. `
`That strange thing will probably test us." `
`"Test us...? `
`...Do you mean... `
`that trial you were just talking about... `
`...that we had to overcome if we wanted to be together? `
`...Is that it?" `
`"...A-A trial?" `
`"......I haven't explained it to you yet, Milady. `
`My apologies. `
`......But please, `
`...if your words just a second ago were the truth, ...please lend me your strength. `
`I will give it everything I've got, so please..." `
`"...I-I don't understand a thing that's been happening... `
`Do you know something, George nii-san?" `
`"A bit. `
`......I'm just as surprised as you by what's happening now. `
`However, if they're saying that this is an unavoidable trial and that we're essential for it, I intend to take on whatever may come." `
`"......A trial...?" `
`"Kanon-kun, `
`the brooch." `
`"Yeah..." `
`The two of them brought the halves of the broken golden butterfly brooch closer to each other. `
`As they grew closer, the strength of their bright yellow radiance increased. `
`"...Jessica-chan, I want you to prepare your heart as well. `
`I am already prepared." `
`"Wh-What do you mean...?! `
`I don't have a clue! `
`What the hell's going on...?!" `
`"It's a trial. `
`A test for a pair of those who love each other." `
`"...H-Huuh...?!" `
`George spoke these awkward-seeming words quickly and easily. `
`It was such an embarrassing line that Jessica couldn't help turning red, `
`...but the expression on George's face, which was so serious that it was almost grim, forced her to tense up as well... `
`Shannon and Kanon were just as serious. `
`...With a glow in their eyes, as though they were taking part in a sacred duel, the pair of them brought the two gold butterfly wings together. `
`Then, the wings they held became a single brooch...and regained their magical power. `
`An even more intense light filled the room... `
`...and the scene was burnt into the retinas of all present... `
`...as the brooch shattered and two shining things flew out of it... `
`"People live for the sake of love! `
`Yes, this world is love itself!" `
`"Oh, how great is the power of love...! `
`Love is everything there is!!" `
`Suddenly, the voices of two people they had never heard before rang out. `
`What was it? `
`Who were they...? `
`George and Jessica nervously opened their eyes... `
`When they did, they saw that two demons had appeared there, `
`...almost as though the two halves of the brooch had become them... `
`"Hey, that's weird, Furfur...!! `
`What are we doing in a place like this?!" `
`"It really is strange, Zepar...!! `
`There's no one but Humans and furniture here! `
`Where's the witch? `
`Where's the witch capable of summoning us?!" `
`"Yes, we remember the name of the witch of the contract really well, don't we? `
`Let's try calling it out, Furfur!" `
`"Yes, you're right, Zepar!! `
`We know the name of the witch of the contract, the Golden Witch!" `
`"Then let's try calling her!" `
`"All together now..." `
`""Beatriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice!!"" `
`Considering their exaggerated, theatrical manner and their slightly comical style of talking, `
`it'd probably be hard to comprehend their great power at this point. `
`When the two demons called Beatrice's name, a cyclone of gold butterflies picked up throughout the room. `
`Then, it took the form of two Golden Witches... `
`"Ooh, there are two Beatrices...!" `
`"Well, there are two of us as well. `
`Why shouldn't there be two Beatrices every now and then?" `
`"This is my double and my little sister. `
`We two are the same and as a single person." `
`"...P-Pleased to meet you." `
`"It has been a long time, Beatrice-sama..." `
`"........." `
`"...A-Am I dreaming...?" `
`"...I feel the same. `
`Still, it's too early to get dumbfounded." `
`Unlike Jessica, George had maintained his composure even during this bizarre scene. `
`...After all, Shannon had already told him what would happen next. `
`"Demons of the contract, it has been too long...! `
`Zepar. `
`And you too, Furfur." `
`"Ah, long time no see! `
`You seem to be in high spirits as always!" `
`"But what a cute little sister you have! `
`I'll bet those teary, juicy eyes taste like white peaches...!" `
`"Uh, ...ah, ...well, I wonder..." `
`Zepar and Furfur latched onto Beato from either side, wearing strange smiles. `
`Each movement they made was exaggerated yet polished, `
`as though they were acting out a play. `
`"Leave it at that for now, demons of the contract. `
`To think that tonight will be the last time we see that mischievous spirit. `
`It will be dearly missed." `
`"The last time...?" `
`"The brooch, our vessel, has already been destroyed!" `
`"Heheheheh, in other words, our role is finished after this! `
`Ah, yes, it has been fun, Beatrice!" `
`"However, it was decided when the contract was made. `
`It was decided that we must lend our power one more time before our final farewell." `
`"So, this is truly the final miracle!" `
`"Once is enough for the miracle of love! `
`After all, eternal love will never be needed a second time!" `
`"...There you have it. `
`Lovers! `
`Those gathered here have been cursed to have unfulfilled love unless a miracle occurs. `
`Your last chance is the power of the golden butterfly brooch, which can grant such a miracle, and like it or not, this chance is limited to this evening! `
`This miracle can be given only to a single pair!" `
`"........." `
`"...I won't lose." `
`"Yeah. `
`...Let's both give it our all." `
`Shannon and Kanon exchanged serious gazes. `
`...Both had already readied themselves to fight for the sake of their love. `
`"I-I don't really get it, `
`...but I don't wanna borrow the power of some strange demon...!" `
`Jessica was finally starting to figure this place out. `
`These demons...were probably planning to pit her and Kanon against George and Shannon. `
`"Let me be clear: this is none of your business! `
`Kanon and I can handle our relationship by ourselves. `
`I shouldn't have to put myself in the debt of some bizarre demons!" `
`"......Milady, please listen. `
`...If we don't overcome this trial, `
`...we cannot be together..." `
`"Jessica, accept it. `
`This is the only trial that could possibly be imposed on upstart furniture wishing to be joined with a Human." `
`"More of this stuff about furniture and Humans! `
`Don't butt in... `
`This has nothing to do with us!!" `
`"You still haven't told Milady...?" `
`"...I didn't know...how I should explain it." `
`"Kanon-kun, Shannon, and you, George nii-san! `
`Why are you listening to these creeps?! `
`No one can stand in the way of a person's love! `
`Why do we have to please these demons?! `
`It's none of their business!!" `
`"Well, it seems we have quite a troublesome blockhead among us. `
`......We could begin the game like this, but that would hardly be fair." `
`"...C-Couldn't you explain it for her? `
`...I don't understand it that well myself. `
`Is there some kind of problem with the love between Jessica-san and Kanon-san...?" `
`"Oh my! `
`It seems you and the others understand nothing at all!" `
`"With our blessing, the pair can cultivate their love at their leisure! `
`No need to worry about suspicious demons!" `
`"However, without our blessing, `
`your love will vanish, disappear, wither and decay." `
`"How the hell're you so sure?!!" `
`""Because that is fate!! `
`You are free to choose not to accept it, free to choose not to resist it!"" `
`"......Oh, and what happens if you choose not to resist it...?" `
`"That love will end. `
`...But perhaps an abstract explanation isn't so convincing. `
`Well now, how could one explain the dead-end fate you're in..." `
`"Ushiromiya Jessica, a future shared between the two of you would be far more grim than you realize." `
`"If you don't gain the miracle of magic, disaster will most certainly befall you." `
`"Then it will cover you, fester within, `
`and split the two of you apart. `
`...Even I will not be so boorish as to describe the details of that process. `
`However, if you don't believe, Jessica, I will tell you how it ends. `
`...Kanon will stop being a servant and will leave the island. `
`For all eternity." `
`"You will probably leave the island yourself in search of the one you love, but such a venture will doubtless be in vain!" `
`"Yes, and then you will mourn and hate!" `
`"Hate who?!" `
`"You!!" `
`"Me?!" `
`""No, the 'you' of this moment!!"" `
`With a dramatic gesture, the two of them pointed at Jessica. `
`...They were saying that, if she left, the person left with regrets would be Jessica herself. `
`"...Wh- `
`What the hell are you... `
`...saying...?" `
`"When you've lost the one you love, you'll realize. `
`You'll realize how much you hate the person you were when you ran away from the trial to complete that love!" `
`"Yes, we're messengers from the 'you' of the future! `
`Please, at this very moment, take your love seriously and fight!" `
`"And if you don't listen to the message of the 'you' from the future?!" `
`"The foolish snake eating its own tail will keep on gulping!" `
`"The endless cycle of suffering will swallow you up, ...and you will simply vanish." `
`"What the...hell are you talking about...?!!" `
`Jessica's confusion showed on her face as anger. `
`...However, a memory of something she'd heard a long time ago welled up in the back of her mind. `
`...Unlike Nee-san, I don't plan on working here for many years... `
`After just a few years, ...or possibly... `
`...If Nee-san ever decides to stop working here, ...I think I'll stop working too... `
`"Kanon...kun..." `
`"........." `
`"If you give up on the miracle of magic and hand it over to Shannon and George, `
`...they will be joined and will leave the island. `
`...Following that, Kanon will leave the island as well. `
`That is fate...and unavoidable." `
`"...Th-Then what if they can obtain the miracle of magic...?" `
`"Of course, Kanon will remain on the island, by Jessica's side for all time. `
`...He will probably start learning music with Jessica as she desires. `
`...How their relationship will progress afterwards is a matter for the two lovers. `
`They can deepen their relationship slowly all by themselves, as Jessica wanted..." `
`"...However, `
`...if that happens, George-san and I will not be joined." `
`"......Fate demands that we fight, `
`...putting our happiness and futures on the line." `
`"...A-Are you kidding me...?! `
`What the hell...?! `
`So if we are joined, the other pair will split apart?! `
`What kind of demon's game is this?!!" `
`"Don't be mistaken. `
`You will not be taking something from each other. `
`...Without the power of the golden butterfly brooch, neither love is fated to bear fruit." `
`"A-And who the hell decided that?!!" `
`"It is due to your sin of falling in love with furniture, which is not allowed to love. `
`...Didn't Kanon clearly reject you, saying that furniture was not qualified to love?! `
`Knowing that, you chose Kanon as the one you loved. `
`I won't let you get away with saying you didn't know...!" `
`"......!" `
`Though she couldn't accept any of it, Jessica was unable to argue back. `
`Then, George spoke up with that soft tone that he always used to smooth things over. `
`...However, his expression was still ruthlessly serious. `
`"...Jessica-chan, `
`can't you think of it this way?" `
`"Think of it...what way...?" `
`"I love Shannon. `
`I am prepared to overcome any and all trials and obstacles that stand in the way of us being together. `
`......What about you?" `
`"W-Well, ...I'm not so weak that I'd lose heart that easily..." `
`"Yes. `
`That's it exactly. `
`At this moment, we are being tested. `
`Tested to see who can display the strength of our feelings more strongly." `
`"......Are you saying...that you actually support this crazy plan of theirs...?" `
`"It doesn't matter whether I support it or not. `
`...When I gave Shannon that engagement ring, I swore to fight all trials and barriers that stand in my way. `
`...No matter how unreasonable or incomprehensible these trials might be, `
`...I cannot choose to avoid them." `
`George spoke clearly, ...then looked at Jessica with a cold gaze. `
`...By now, Jessica almost understood. `
`If she kept on grumbling and avoiding this demons' trial, `
`...the game between the two groups would automatically end with her defeat by default. `
`In other words, George and Shannon would win. `
`Then they would gain the miracle of magic, their love would be completed, `
`......and Jessica and Kanon would split apart, `
`...with Kanon eventually leaving the island and never seeing her again. `
`"...Nothing would make me happier `
`than to see you step out of this trial. `
`...That way, I wouldn't have to fight you. `
`And that would show the limits of your feelings for Kanon-kun." `
`"Nn......gah......" `
`It seemed as though George spoke ruthlessly, ...but he was actually being exceptionally fair. `
`If Jessica lost by default, she would never be able to clear away her lingering regrets. `
`That would leave a bad aftertaste for George as well. `
`"...We must fight openly for that single miracle. `
`...Even if I lose at the end, `
`...I'll be able to accept it if we both gave it our all. `
`And because of that, I will be able to cheer on the victors from the bottom of my heart." `
`"......Hmph. `
`...George's determination is quite impressive." `
`"After hearing that-" `
`"Are you still going to run away?" `
`The two demons giggled and challenged her. `
`Of course, George didn't laugh, but he still challenged her with cold eyes. `
`"......And Shannon...?" `
`"...Please forgive me, Milady. `
`...I'm determined not to flinch in my resolve. `
`......Even if I know... `
`...that sticking to my feelings... `
`...means ending your loving relationship, Milady." `
`Shannon had never before spoken to Jessica with such serious and solemn words. `
`Jessica realized what a strong will had dwelt within her usually weak and clumsy friend, and was surprised. `
`"Kanon-kun......" `
`"I...want to start a new life with you, Milady. `
`...Even if that life... `
`...means crushing Nee-san's happiness, `
`...I will not falter..." `
`Kanon was also doing all he could to restrain himself. `
`Yes. `
`All of them... `
`...were being serious and frank... `
`and abandoning any naivety they might have possessed. `
`All this about golden butterfly brooches and miracles of magic... `
`And the trial that the demons were giving them... `
`...None of it mattered. `
`Only one thing was being tested. `
`Whether or not they possessed the strong will to make their love come true. `
`Jessica clenched her fists...and hung her head, shaking, while biting her lower lip. `
`She was silent, but she would probably gain an unswerving will of steel before too long. `
`...She just needed a little time first. `
`The two demons who taunted people with dramatic gestures... `
`did not violate this silence that Jessica needed to resolve herself. `
`Love brings about conflict, and this conflict gives rise to determination. `
`As the demons of love, they could understand more fully than any others how noble that determination was... `
`"......Jessica-san..." `
`"Furthermore, ...this magical miracle is something that can be received by you as well." `
`"By me too......? `
`Wh-What...do you mean...?" `
`She had thought this had been about two pairs of lovers. `
`Beato was surprised to suddenly hear that this had something to do with her as well... `
`"With the miracle of the golden butterfly brooch, `
`......even your wish, `
`...your wish that your affection for Battler will be acknowledged, can be granted easily. `
`...And without such a miracle, `
`......you too can never be bound to him." `
`".........!" `
`"It means you're no outsider to this either." `
`"To cut across the marshes of love! `
`That is your wish, is it not?!" `
`"We will not make light of your wish!" `
`"...Even your relationship with Battler will eventually fester and rot. `
`...No matter how much of a positive outlook you take, `
`you know that this fate will eventually come to pass, barring some kind of miracle." `
`"......Well......" `
`Beato hung her head sadly. `
`She hadn't wanted to lose heart from that cookie incident. `
`...However, it would have been a massive lie to say that it hadn't hurt her... `
`The more she tried to get close to Battler, the more she hurt him. `
`However, she had been born in order to get close to Battler. `
`...She was like a hedgehog freezing in the cold and bunching together for warmth. `
`She had approached him because of love...and had been hurt for it... `
`"If you understand that much, entrusting your fate to a miracle may prove to be of some interest. `
`As they say, an un-bought lottery ticket earns you nothing. `
`Zepar, Furfur! `
`Let my little sister join in too." `
`"Oh, of course!" `
`"Welcome, second Beatrice...! `
`We were planning on including you from the very beginning!" `
`""After all, we are Zepar and Furfur! `
`The demons of love!!"" `
`"...M-May I...join in as well...?" `
`"If you want to, I don't see a problem. `
`I won't prevent anyone from entering. `
`We'll win against all hindrances and make everyone celebrate our union. `
`...Of course, it's the same the other way around. `
`If you succeed in love by defeating us at our best, `
`then both Shannon and I promise to sincerely support the pair that wins. `
`Right, Shannon?" `
`"Yes. `
`We will not lose. `
`And even if we did, we would cheer you on from the bottom of our hearts." `
`"...I feel the same. `
`I will not lose." `
`"......Well, if there's no way out of this fight, `
`...let's show 'em what we've got. `
`...No matter what! `
`Kanon-kun and I don't plan on losing." `
`"You feel the same, do you not?" `
`"...Y-Yes... `
`...If there is even a small chance that Father... `
`ah... `
`no... `
`...that Battler-san will acknowledge me, `
`I'm willing to put myself on the line." `
`"Well said. `
`Good going, little sister. `
`Zepar, Furfur! `
`The actors have gathered!" `
`"Then let's begin, Furfur!" `
`"Yes, let us begin, Zepar!" `
`""Let's begin this trial of lovers, the fight over a single miracle of magic...!!"" `
