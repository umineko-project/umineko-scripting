`""Then let the pair exchange their rings!!"" `
`...Beato took Battler's hand...and put a ring with the seal of the One-Winged Eagle on his finger. `
`"......Are you sure...?" `
`"You already are the territory lord. `
`...So, this ring belongs to you, Battler-san." `
`"...You're really sure? `
`...At this rate, the world you created, ...and the tale..." `
`"Yes. `
`......I created this tale because I wished to be with you. `
`...That means the purpose of this world has been fulfilled. `
`...So, from now on, ...I want you to write it. `
`...The continuing tale...of you and me." `
`"............" `
`"...Or is doing it like that too awkward for yooou? `
`*cackle*cackle* I'm just pushing the tiresome task of territory lord onto you anyway. `
`It's much easier being the wife, where you only have to brag...!" `
`"I just need to play around and wait for you to write a new tale. `
`And, for each new tale you write, I'll play any part you need. `
`......Be it an evil witch, or a rival. `
`...A lover, ...or a wife." `
`"My tales are pretty intense. `
`You'll be busy from dawn until dusk." `
`"Indeed...... Bring it on..." `
`Beato's hand relinquished the ring of the territory lord... `
`From Battler, she received a silver ring with a crest that could only be worn by the wife of the territory lord. `
`They exchanged their rings, ...and their wedding was complete. `
`Then, the pair turned around, ...faced the packed crowd of guests, and raised their rings high. `
`A thunderous applause rang out for them... `
`"As a memorial to this night's events, the great territory lord will now recognize the accomplishments of certain people." `
`"Let those called come forward." `
`At Battler's nod, Beato read the name of the first guest to be recognized. `
`"...Kanon, `
`come forward." `
`"K-Kanon-kun...?!" `
`A girl goat pushed her way through the crowd, took off her mask, and yelled. `
`A cloud of gold butterflies gathered before Battler and Beato... `
`...and took the form of Kanon, kneeling in front of these two nobles. `
`Kanon had already died and vanished. `
`...However, all of the dead revive in the Golden Land. `
`"Kanon, right here..." `
`"When my husband was locked up and in danger, `
`you rescued him and displayed your capability for self-sacrifice by choosing to remain in that eternal prison in his place. `
`Such devotion is deserving of an award. `
`Therefore, we will allow for your resurrection, as well as your continued service." `
`"...Yes ma'am! `
`I am honored...and delighted!" `
`"Kanon-kun, ...Y-Yoshiya-kun!! `
`Yoshiya-kunnnn!! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!" `
`Jessica raced forward and landed sobbing in Kanon's chest. `
`Kanon patted her head gently and held her... `
`"You won't be serving as furniture. `
`You'll be serving as a human. `
`...Do you understand what that means?" `
`"......Yes." `
`After glancing at Jessica sobbing, ...he looked at Battler again and nodded forcefully. `
`"Now for the next pair. `
`Ushiromiya George and Shannon! `
`Come forward!!" `
`""Yes."" `
`George and Shannon were the next to be called. `
`Perhaps they had already readied themselves. `
`They walked forward boldly and kneeled. `
`"Ushiromiya George, right here." `
`"Shannon, right here..." `
`"You two withstood Zepar and Furfur's trials until the very end. `
`Your great achievements and affection, determination and nobility were exemplary and deserving of an award. `
`Therefore, your marriage certificate has been issued with the territory lord's signature!" `
`""We are honored and delighted!"" `
`"No one will be allowed to object to this certificate! `
`Let the families of those recognized bless their union with all their hearts!!" `
`"And so, `
`now that there's nothing stopping these two, let's all throw rice at them and celebrate. `
`Hey, congrats, you two!" `
`When the territory lord clapped his hands in celebration, it spread throughout the entire cathedral. `
`Then, a group of goats in the front line of the crowd took their masks off one by one... `
`"...L-Listen up, okay?! `
`I'll never forgive you if you make too much salty miso soup! `
`And George is getting a little overweight, so go easy on the sugar-" `
`"George! When a man gets married, `
`he's got to treasure his wife even more than his parents! `
`No matter what your mother says, you make sure you protect Shannon-chan!" `
`"Yes, of course!!" `
`"George-san...!!" `
`"G-George needs a solid seven hours of sleep each night `! `
`I'll never forgive you if you let him stay up late!! `
`And don't forget that washing his back and cleaning his ears are also a wife's responsibilities!!" `
`"I-Is that true...? Wh-What have I done..." `
`"...A-A wife's job can vary, depending on the family..." `
`"Rudolf-san, have you been treasuring your wife?" `
`"O-Of course... `
`Why would you doubt that...?!" `
`"Find happiness, you two. `
`Marriage isn't a goal. `
`It's just the starting line, okay?" `
`"Uu-uu-uu-! `
`Congratulations, congratulations!!" `
`"Uryu-!! Congratulaaaaaaatioons!!!" `
`"We mustn't lose either." `
`"Heh, heheheheheheh...!! `
`Y-Yeah, no way we're losing, dammiiiiiiiiiiit!!" `
`All of the Ushiromiya family, all of the servants, and all of the spirits and demons in attendance... `
`celebrated the honorees with an even greater applause... `
`And so, ......the curtain closes on the tale woven by the Golden Witch. `
`Perhaps we should finish this tale with the epitaph. `
`The following is the passage of the Golden Land, from the epitaph of the Golden Witch. `
`{e:070:The witch shall praise the wise and bestow four treasures. `
`One shall be all the gold from the Golden Land. `
`One shall be the resurrection of all the dead souls. `
`One shall be the resurrection of the love that was lost. `
`One shall be to put the witch to sleep for all time. `
`Sleep peacefully, my beloved witch, Beatrice...} `
`"...... `
`...So, this means Beato was satisfied and put to sleep...?" `
`"That interpretation is probably appropriate..." `
`"And? `
`Now that the game's over, Onii-chan will be released, right? `
`...What will he do next?" `
`"...Who knows? `
`......The book of this Fragment tells no more of the story." `
`"......So, in the end, we don't even get to see what comes next for him. `
`........." `
`...Nothing comes next for him. `
`In the end, Onii-chan and the others never came back. `
`They reached the Golden Land and had a great time together there. `
`...Even if the tale tells us that, ...the truth is... `
`that everyone died in that huge accident... `
`"Still, ...we've learned a lot of very interesting things. `
`...It seems that island...really was a crazy island of illusions." `
`"Indeed. `
`...And your reading was truly wonderful..." `
`"...I feel worn out, like watching a six-hour movie all at once. `
`...I'm tired." `
`"Ushiromiya Ange, `
`you truly have worked hard. `
`......Your reading has soothed my boredom. `
`I, Featherine, am more grateful to you than I have been for so many years that I cannot remember..." `
`"If you're grateful, why can't I have some kind of award too?" `
`"Hmm, what would be good... `
`Give me some time. `
`I will think." `
`Featherine sat down in her rocking chair and rocked it, apparently trying to think of something... `
`"...Ushiromiya Ange, `
`you really have worked hard. `
`...You have done well to keep reading for me until the end. `
`...With this, your responsibilities as my miko are lifted. `
`You may return to your original world and be reunited with the fate you have been given." `
`"Sheesh. `
`...Feels like this was one hell of a side-trip." `
`"Do not pout. `
`I am thinking of a reward now... `
`...Yes, that's something I haven't done much... `
`or rather, at all, ...for quite some time. `
`...I imagine the ink from the bottle has dried up by now..." `
`Even after the tale ended, Ange and Hachijo's debate over it continued for quite some time. `
`It had been very serious...and fiery. `
`Ange had acknowledged that this tale was no crazy literary work, `
`...but a new message bottle, which had drifted here once more from the Rokkenjima of 12 years previous... `
`to tell her of one truth... `
`And, ......it seemed as though she had found her own interpretation of the truth she thought the tale was trying to tell. `
`...Of course, that was only one truth, `
`and it did not mean an end to her journey. `
`However, ...maybe it can be viewed this way. `
`It wasn't sufficient to fill the 12-year gap in her heart. `
`...However, at that moment, ...just enjoying the feeling `
`along with the bitter coffee Hachijo had made...was enough. `
`"...Thank you for reading until the end. `
`...And thank you for your thoughts and opinions. `
`...I'm sure the very first Endless Witch is happy..." `
`"......Wow, so you can bring yourself to say stuff like that. `
`...If you'd just talk like that from the beginning, you'd have tons more fans." `
`"...I am merely praising the wonderful reader that you most certainly are. `
`...I just wanted to say that spending the time I have left in my life writing for you alone... `
`was much more productive than writing for those pigs who do not talk and cannot think would have been... `
`*giggle*." `
`"That's just the kind of thing you'd be better off not saying. `
`...Well, I'll take it as a compliment. `
`...Okay." `
`I get the feeling...that I've spent a really, really long time here. `
`It feels...as though I've spent a major fraction of my life here. `
`...Though it should feel uncomfortable, sitting here on a sofa in someone else's house, `
`...for some strange reason, it feels as familiar as my own home. `
`However, the clock says it's only been about two or three hours since I met her. `
`...My sense of time feels very strange... `
`"...Your friend seems to be taking his time..." `
`"It must be a long phone call. `
`It's creepy for a guy to talk that long on the phone." `
`He said he was going to make a scheduled report to Okonogi-san, didn't he? `
`Even though he was told that he could use the phone here, he declined and went to look for a public phone somewhere. `
`...Something about how he didn't want to risk being bugged. `
`He's a moron, so I'll let him do what he wants. `
`"Is the nearest public phone far?" `
`"If you go out onto the street, there's a store on the corner a short ways down." `
`"Then I'll be on my way. `
`...You can use this to pay for food or whatever." `
`"...If I let you keep that money, `
`will you come again, read my next manuscript, and tell me your opinions...?" `
`"...You're willing to pay rolls of money to get an un-cute girl like me to read your manuscript?" `
`"No. `
`You really were a good, clear-thinking reader. `
`...We create these tales and throw them out into the world in search of people like you." `
`"...You praise me too much. `
`I just take books a little too seriously." `
`"As thanks for the considerable time you have given to me, `
`......I will someday write your tale." `
`"Am I going to appear in one of your Forgeries again? `
`...I hope you kill me in a slightly better way this time." `
`"...Do you...like miracles?" `
`"You mean like a deus ex machina plot development? `
`...I used to hate them, but recently I've become a big fan. `
`Still, I've become a bit of a picky eater, and simply falling from a skyscraper and ending up unharmed doesn't quite qualify as a miracle to me anymore." `
`"......Then perhaps one day, I will write a tale that you will consider a miracle..." `
`"I'm...really sorry for barging in all of a sudden and saying all kinds of mean things." `
`"...No, it was a worthwhile conversation. `
`...I wonder if my head editor will set up another meeting between the two of us..." `
`"Sure, if there's another chance for one. `
`<See you again, have a nice day>." `
`"Yes, it may happen again sometime. `
`...I pray that you find your truth." `
`"Thank you." `
`"If you ever do reach a truth of your own, `
`...please try making that a tale as well someday..." `
`"......You want me to become one of you witches? `
`I wonder. `
`I'm bad at writing. `
`A good reader isn't necessarily a good writer, you know?" `
`"Ah, quite true. `
`I myself can never read anything written by anyone else." `
`"...Sheesh. `
`Then, I'm off." `
`"After this, I will probably never see you again, `
`...but I pray I will be fortunate enough to meet another you someday, ...somewhere." `
`"...... `
`Can I ask one last question?" `
`"Go ahead..." `
`"......That Featherine witch, who appeared within the tale. `
`...That's...you, right?" `
`"It may be presumptuous to say it, but that was my intention." `
`"......... `
`...This might be a strange question, but...umm... `
`......Are you Featherine? `
`Or is Featherine you?" `
`"...Well now. `
`...What might you be talking about...?" `
`That mysterious woman was mysterious to the last. `
`......And so, the day of which I had no {i:memories} ended, and on the following day, I would take a boat to Niijima. `
`I'll probably never meet her again. `
`However, that just means that 'I' won't meet her, ...so some other 'me' might meet her somewhere down the road. `
`...Just as 'I' have reached several truths, they must also...want to reach the truth. `
`So long, Featherine. `
`...If you ever write a decent story, please call me again. `
`If I'm free, I might drop by... `
`"No problem. `
`It's the most luxurious escort job I've had yet. `
`...I'd almost like to invite you along, sir." `
`"...I'll take a pass on that. `
`You know how old I am. `
`I'm done running around all over the place..." `
`The person on the other end of the line...was Okonogi. `
`...Okonogi was also a man who tended to move from place to place, so it hadn't been easy to catch him even on the phone. `
`"Our trip's been pretty <cool>, and right now, there's no need to run around." `
`"Sumadera Kasumi is searching for you like mad. `
`...According to our informants, she's already gotten a ride to Rokkenjima. `
`You'll bump into her there." `
`"So, just as planned." `
`"...It'll likely be just five or six people at most. `
`And they'll probably be armed with nothing more than handguns. `
`They're no match for you. `
`Feel free to run wild. `
`But make sure you kill them. `
`...Were you able to aquire one of your favorite toys?" `
`"Of course. `
`I'm surprised you managed to arrange for it in this country." `
`Behind Amakusa was the rental car that they'd borrowed under a false name, `
`...inside of which was now a black golf bag. `
`"The Sumadera Head Family has already given the okay, but make sure you get out of Japan as soon as you're done. `
`Don't forget to buy your cup ramen by the box in Narita before your flight out." `
`"Heheheh, I'll take care this time. `
`...It's an easy job." `
`"Also, ......you do understand about 'that', right?" `
`"That...? `
`...Well, I'm not sure what you mean." `
`"...Playing dumb, are we? `
`...Well, that's okay. `
`Despite how you talk, you've never betrayed my expectations in the past. `
`...If you're clever about it, you won't even have to get your hands dirty. `
`...There should be plenty of ways to handle it." `
`"...... `
`...Heheh, I'm not sure what you're talking about." `
`"...I realize that Ange-chan is a child to be pitied. `
`...If only she could've stayed true to that and acted the part of a secluded young lady. `
`...When we decided to join forces after Eva-san's death, we reached an agreement. `
`...This little portable shrine of ours is important, ...but she's also a liability. `
`This is for the sake of world peace as well, okay?" `
`"......So, watch and see how it goes. `
`I hope those Sumadera black-suits know how to shoot a gun right." `
`"............" `
`"Hmm? `
`What is it, sir?" `
`"...Don't tell me that, after a few days on the run, `
`you and Ange-chan have already hooked up...?" `
`"Hah. `
`...Me and that bratty little girl? ...Please." `
`"Well, it's not like I care... `
`It just means you've finally managed to break free enough that you can take passes at girls, right? `
`...Half of the world is made up of women. `
`You'll never last if just one or two of them make you freeze up." `
`"......... `
`...Oh, speak of the devil. `
`She's here. `
`......Guess that's all for today. `
`I'll contact you after I reach our lodgings on Niijima. `
`Later." `
`Ange was walking down the street. `
`Why'd she have to do that, when I told her to wait for me to come back? `
`...If only she wasn't like this, she might've lived a long life. `
`"...That was a pretty long call. `
`I was so tired of waiting that I left." `
`"Heheh. Sorry about that. `
`...How was it for you, Lady? `
`Did you learn anything interesting...?" `
`"It was interesting. `
`......I've harvested all I need." `
`"Hyahha...! `
`Sounds <cool>." `
`After Amakusa opened the passenger's side door, Ange got in the car. `
`Amakusa quickly went around to the driver's seat. `
`"......Then let's head to the harbor. `
`According to the old man, the Sumadera family has set up a net." `
`"......If we do get caught, then that's the measure of my luck. `
`...If we don't, ...then Rokkenjima is waiting for me. `
`...Let's leave it all to luck." `
`"...Luck, is it?" `
`"When you can't decide what to do, `
`or when it doesn't matter either way, `
`...it's not so bad to entrust your fate to a coin toss." `
`"Heheh. `
`Then I guess I'll try leaving it to luck too. `
`......I've gotta admit, I'm a fan of that kind of thing." `
`"...Great, my bodyguard just said he's gonna leave everything to luck. `
`Wonderful." `
`"I had to leave for that phone call, so I totally missed the clincher. `
`What happened after I left? Let's hear it." `
`"No. I'm not telling." `
`"That's a shame." `
`The car dashed through the hilly town... `
`That car wouldn't return to Hachijo's house for all eternity. `
`However, Ange didn't get sentimental about it. `
`For now, ...she just wanted to silently consider the new message bottle that the current Endless Witch, Hachijo Tohya, `
`had given her... `
`In the rear-view mirror, the town where a witch lived faded off into the distance. `
`However, that scene wasn't reflected in Ange's eyes... `
