`...All that could be heard was the sound of the wind. `
`A sound of misfortune, bringing sadness and unease to all who heard it. `
`Slowly, ...I came back to my senses. `
`I finally regained consciousness on top of a bed with a firm mattress... `
`Where...was this, again...? `
`I can't remember where this is, `
`...but I can vaguely recall...that I must not remain here. `
`The room was dimly lit. `
`There was a light on, but that just made the darkness and eeriness of the room more apparent. `
`There were no curtains over the window, but it was too dark outside to see anything beyond it. `
`If I squinted into that pitch-blackness, `
`...it felt as though I could see the witch of the forest peeking back at me from the darkness, `
`...and I averted my gaze from the window in fear. `
`...I can't see or hear it, `
`...but I get the feeling that if I leave this room, it'll be bright and warm, and someone else will be there for me. `
`I want to get to where everyone else is as soon as I can... `
`Bad memories from when I was very young began to well up. `
`Horrible, harsh memories...of when I started dozing off during a family gathering and was put to sleep in some room I didn't know. `
`I remember waking up there, incredibly lonely and sobbing... `
`I...must not remain in this room. `
`I just want to get out of here quickly. `
`Once that thought crossed my mind, I didn't want to stay in the room a second longer than I had to. `
`I'm scared. `
`It's creepy. `
`...Where is everyone? `
`I want to get out of here right now... `
`I opened the door, trying to leave the room. `
`A pleasant glow snuck in through the crack of the door. `
`...As I'd thought, the corridor was filled with a comforting light. `
`I couldn't actually hear them, but I could sense that far away, people were enjoying themselves. `
`...I'm sure everyone's gathered in the room across from this one. `
`...I've been shut up in this lonely, creepy room...all alone. `
`I should go, quickly. `
`As soon as I thought this, a merciless metallic sound rang out, and the door refused to open any further. `
`......The chain had been set. `
`I've always hated chain locks. `
`You can open a normal lock just by twisting. `
`...But chain locks are built in an annoying way, and I couldn't work them easily. `
`...So I've hated them ever since I was very young. `
`......See? `
`...Even this chain... `
`is causing me trouble...and I just can't get it undone. `
`Why is this happening? I just want to leave this creepy room right away... `
`Just on the other side of this thin door, everything is bathed in a warm light... `
`I can't undo it... I just can't undo this chain. `
`The more desperate I grew, `
`the more that unsettling darkness seemed to be closing in on my back, and the more frightened I became... `
`...Then, I finally noticed. `
`There's something...wrong with this chain. `
`...Yes, there is a chain, `
`...but this isn't a chain lock. `
`This is just a chain staked into the door, preventing it from opening any further... `
`In other words, it isn't made to be opened. `
`"...Wh-What the hell's going on...? `
`Who'd do something like this, dammit..." `
`No matter what I did, no matter how much I struggled, I couldn't pull out the stake or undo the chain or break the mechanism. `
`This door was just a demon's mouth...made to trick me into thinking it would open before crushing my hopes. `
`Even so, if only I could just open this door somehow, I could get out into that pleasant corridor... `
`This desire forced me to keep my hand glued to the doorknob. `
`But it was useless. `
`Both the chain and the stake were firm, and no matter how much I clattered them about, there was no chance of the door opening any further. `
`Even though I could see the pleasant hallway through the crack, I had no chance of opening the door any further. `
`Maybe someone will come if I yell... `
`Maybe the door can be opened easily from the outside... `
`When I thought this, `
`...I tried to call out to someone, `
`...but I couldn't make the words come out. `
`I could mouth "someone, come here", `
`but no voice left my lips. `
`What's...going on...?! `
`Someone, come... `
`Why can't I cry out...?! `
`Help me help me help me. `
`The mere fact that I can't say "help me" out loud is even scarier. `
`If I turn around, `
`...the witch gazing into the room from the darkness outside... `
`...might be inside the room this time, standing right behind me... `
`I'm frightened...I'm scared I'm scared I'm scared... `
`Someone help me, someone help me... `
`I can't get out...can't get out... `
`Let me out...of this room... `
`help me, `
`I'm scared `
`I'm scared `
`I'm scared, `
`let me out `
`let me out `
`let me out, `
`help me `
`help me `
`help me... `
`"It sounds like they've arrived, Lady." `
`"Huh? `
`......Oh......" `
`Amakusa ran his finger down my cheek. `
`In an instant, I awoke from the doze I'd just been in. `
`I glared at Amakusa for waking me up in such a creepy way, but he just pretended not to notice. `
`Where...is this? `
`It feels like a parlor in some dignified person's house, `
`...but I have no memory of this place at all. `
`"........." `
`Where...is this...? `
`...And...why am I... `
`"You still half-asleep, Lady?" `
`"...Yeah, sorry. `
`Where are we...?" `
`"Huh?" `
`Apparently, he hadn't expected me to forget something like that just because I wasn't fully awake yet. `
`...For once, I agreed with him. `
`Why am I in some parlor that I don't recognize? `
`The sound of the footsteps from the "they" Amakusa had mentioned... `
`had come right up to the opposite side of the door. `
`I could hear conversing voices. `
`Is that a woman...? `
`Judging by the coffee and snacks laid in front of me, I was the guest here. `
`In that case, I'd better remember why I came here... `
`or at least who it was I came to visit... `
`Who am I? `
`Ushiromiya Ange. `
`Who's the man standing behind me? `
`Amakusa Juuza. `
`The man who used to be my guard long ago. `
`He's now the bodyguard Okonogi assigned to me. `
`...In that case, ...is this after Aunt Eva's death, `
`...when I've thrown off my pursuers... `
`...on that journey to find out what happened 12 years ago...? `
`...Is that how it went...? `
`...Do I really...have {i:a memory like this}...? `
`After a knock, the door opened, `
`and the person I must have come here to meet entered along with an assistant. `
`...Oh, wonderful. `
`...Even after seeing her face, I can't remember who she is. `
`"Our sincere apologies for keeping you waiting. `
`Hachijo Tohya is here." `
`That's a relief. `
`The assistant introduced her to me first. `
`...And, I finally remembered who she was... `
`"She"? `
`I thought it was a "he"... `
`"Excuse me, ...but are you...?" `
`"That's right. `
`......I am Hachijo Tohya ({p:0:八城十八})." `
`"The magazines were all talking about your book signing event. `
`Supposedly, a mysterious male author showed up wearing sunglasses and a mask... `
`Never thought you'd be a woman... What's the deal?" `
`"...That was just a double arranged for by the editing department. `
`I was the helper standing behind him at the book signing." `
`"Heh, now there's a shock... `
`...I haven't read your works, `
`but I'll bet you're even more mysterious than your books." `
`"Readers only pretend to read books. `
`...They read them based merely on the name of the author and the brand and think that they've actually read them. `
`...No matter what I write in my books, they don't truly read anything. `
`They just pretend to read so they can look smart and knowledgeable and keep up with the current fad. `
`...Why on earth should I expose myself to these people? `
`Why indulge such trash?" `
`"...I see. `
`Looks like...you're Madam Hachijo all right." `
`This person really is eccentric... `
`There's no doubt about it... This is Hachijo Tohya herself... `
`Hachijo Tohya is a mystery novelist who's become the center of discussion lately. `
`It seems her books themselves have been highly praised, but it's her mysterious debut that's attracted so much attention towards her lately. `
`Last year, she managed to win several different awards for exceptional mystery novels offered by multiple large publishing companies, `
`submitting each of her works under a different pen name. `
`And after that, several highly-regarded anonymous works were discovered, one after another, to have been stories she had written in the past under false names, `
`and her popularity soared as she herself became more mysterious than her books. `
`Despite all of this, the author herself never appeared in public, and everything about her was wrapped in a veil of secrecy. `
`However, just a few days ago, this author finally made a public appearance for a book signing, showing up with a mask that covered "his" face and drawing even more public attention... `
`...And yet, apparently even that had been a fake. `
`Given this person's radically unconventional track record, `
`it was hardly a surprise to hear her casually insult her fans like this. `
`"I know quite a lot about you too, Ushiromiya Ange-san. `
`The talk shows have been saying all sorts of things..." `
`"I'm sure you've heard nothing good." `
`"Yes. `
`Nothing good at all. `
`Apparently, you employ and fire people on a whim, `
`try to resolve everything with money, and care nothing for the law as long as you get your way." `
`"Yep, sounds about right. `
`Heheheh!" `
`"However, `
`...I happen to like intelligent people like you." `
`"...Is that why you agreed to meet with me?" `
`"Exactly. `
`You're the only person who's managed to spot that Itouikukuro Reigonamu is another pen name used by me, Hachijo Tohya. `
`That's actually quite impressive..." `
`"Itouikukuro Reigonamu. `
`It was a pretty strange pen name. `
`However, if you match the Japanese syllables to numbers, you can read it as 11019960576." `
`11,019,960,576. `
`This massive number is equal to 18 to the eighth power. `
`18 to the eighth. `
`In Japanese, "tohya no hachijo". `
`...Or, in other words, Hachijo Tohya... `
`"Heheh, ...very well done. `
`I was quite impressed. `
`In fact, I was so impressed, I decided to let you meet me in person. `
`...Welcome to my mansion, child of man." `
`Her manner of speaking was extremely condescending, `
`but, perhaps because of her elegant manner, it didn't feel particularly irritating. `
`This person had a sort of majestic grandeur about her which made that style of speech seem almost natural. `
`...At least, that's how it felt to me. `
`...In fact, it felt almost as though this was the manifestation of some noble being, `
`who would have no need to show herself before mere Humans under normal circumstances. `
`Since I'm not particularly a fan of hers, `
`I guess this is proof that her mysterious charisma really is nothing to be laughed at... `
`However, I didn't come here to talk to Hachijo Tohya, the mystery novelist. `
`...I'm interested in Itouikukuro {ruby:0576:Reigonamu}, `
`the mysterious web author who only released her works over the Internet... `
`Around the Japanese parts of the Internet, Itouikukuro is an extremely famous Witch Hunter. `
`However, she isn't a big opinion leader like Professor Ootsuki. `
`She's one of those "Message Bottle Forgers", who are always the center of vigorous debate... `
`Message Bottle Forgers are, as the name suggests, `
`people who forge and post the contents of what purport to be mysterious message bottles detailing the events of the Rokkenjima incident. `
`They claim to have discovered a new message bottle... `
`and post either a very similar counterfeit story or a new theory with their own interpretation of the truth, all of which are supposedly written by Ushiromiya Maria. `
`In so doing, they openly take on the name "Ushiromiya Maria", `
`writing up new bizarre tales as if they'd been present themselves and knew the truth. `
`They then send these stories out into the newest sea discovered by Humankind--the Internet--claiming that it's a third or fourth message bottle... `
`All of the first Forgers were either simple pranksters `
`or crooks trying to swindle collectors. `
`Eventually though, people who claimed to have solved the riddles of the message bottle tales and reached the "truth" started to appear, `
`and they started creating original works of their own, third and fourth message bottles from Ushiromiya Maria, as though they had moved over to the riddle-teller's side. `
`These people rewrote the tale of the witch with whatever interpretations they wanted, and every once in a while, parts of their theories would gain big followings on the net. `
`Some of these "creations" grew to be so widely trusted that they were believed to contain some grain of truth. `
`The more rigid Witch Hunters openly despised these people, calling them "Forgers", "Counterfeiters", or just "Witches". `
`Though they claimed to have reached the truth, they refused to tell anyone and created fake message bottles as though testing everyone else. `
`It was no surprise that more straight-laced Witch Hunters were seriously annoyed by these Forgers... `
`However, among those who simply liked to entertain themselves with the occult fantasy of Rokkenjima, `
`an extremely small number accepted these creations as literary works, `
`glad of these additions to the mysterious tale... `
`Itouikukuro was the most highly regarded of these Forgers. `
`"...<End of the Golden Witch>. `
`I've read that one. `
`...That's one hell of a hobby you've got there, killing off other people's families however you like." `
`"Did you come all the way here just to say that...? `
`I think not, final descendant of the Ushiromiya family." `
`In her latest forgery, "End", she killed off seven members of my family, at least during the actual story. `
`No, if you count "Alliance" and "Banquet", the other forgeries she's made before now, `
`then she's killed off most of my family in horrible ways, over and over again... `
`Of course I want to complain. `
`However, all of her works are known for being, in both form and level of perfection, `
`the closest tales to those written by "Ushiromiya Maria" herself. `
`In particular, Itouikukuro's first forgery, "Banquet of the Golden Witch", `
`managed to fit everything, including Ushiromiya Eva's escape to Kuwadorian. `
`People wondered whether this might be the true story of Rokkenjima, and it even made it onto the talk shows... `
`So far, all of these tales have been nothing more than electronic text on the web. `
`...However, people will eventually realize that Itouikukuro is actually Hachijo Tohya. `
`When that happens, they'll become the works of "that bizarre Hachijo", and no one will think of them as mere fan creations. `
`...People will probably start wondering if this might actually be a third message bottle she found and released under the guise of a story she herself wrote. `
`When that happens, these stories will probably seem even more bizarre and credible... `
`"...You're pretty cunning, aren't you?" `
`"Why do you say that?" `
`"You're doing this to make your forgeries seem more mysterious and more credible." `
`"And what do you mean by credible?" `
`"Once you've gained credibility, your forgeries will rise to the level of truth." `
`"Rise to the level of truth? `
`Hmph, how foolish. `
`Such a thing is unnecessary for my works." `
`"...Are you saying that because your works are truth, and not mere forgeries...?" `
`"Correct. `
`They are truth, so there's no need for them to rise into anything." `
`"You aren't Maria onee-chan. `
`And you definitely weren't on Rokkenjima on that day. `
`So how can you be so absurd as to call this the truth?" `
`"Hey, don't lose your cool, Lady." `
`"Shut up, what makes you think I'm losing my cool?" `
`"*giggle*..." `
`Ange half-realized that she'd let her emotions get the better of her. `
`She let out a sigh and shrugged... `
`"Your reason for coming here. `
`It wasn't to yell at me for killing your family several times within my forgeries, correct...?" `
`Hachijo had been smiling at Ange kindly, ...but in a condescending manner... `
`or else, like a mother might watch over a very small child. `
`Ange realized this and was unable to suppress her irritation. `
`Apparently, Amakusa could tell that Ange was getting worked up. `
`He joked around with her for a bit, so that they could start the conversation over again from the beginning. `
`"The thing you came here to hear... `
`...It's the "truth" that I've reached, is it not?" `
`"......Why are you so sure that you've reached the truth...?" `
`"Because I've understood all of the tales." `
`"And I'm asking you why you're so sure about that." `
`"...Do you think the sun ever revolved around the earth?" `
`Hachijo suddenly started talking about the Ptolemaic theory. `
`...Ange was about to tell her not to answer questions with more questions, but she quickly realized what Hachijo meant. `
`"...Humans used to support the Ptolemaic theory. `
`However, that theory has been rejected in the modern age. `
`...Does this mean that, at the instant that theory was rejected, the sun stopped moving and the Earth started revolving around the sun?" `
`"...Of course not. `
`The truth doesn't change based on what Humans believe." `
`"Then right now, `
`your denial of my truth means exactly the same thing." `
`The idea of Heliocentrism was proposed by several scholars before Galileo. `
`...However, it was hard to objectively prove that theory using the scientific techniques available at the time. `
`Even so, that didn't change what the truth was. `
`"And yet it moves." `
`"...So, you're saying the truth is still the truth whether you can prove it or not...?" `
`"Correct. `
`In the future, `
`when the full truth finally becomes known, `
`people will look back and realize that I had already discovered it." `
`Apparently, Ange just couldn't stand Hachijo's attitude. `
`She kept getting irritated, and every time, Amakusa would joke around until she settled down again. `
`However, there could be no mistake that Hachijo was a genius... `
`and had used her extraordinary intuition to form a most interesting outlook on the events that occurred on that island... `
`That was why Ange had wanted to contact Itouikukuro and hear her views. `
`Still, this meeting truly had been fortunate for Ange. `
`She hadn't been absolutely sure that Itouikukuro was Hachijo Tohya, `
`she hadn't thought that the publishing company would really contact the author, `
`...and moreover, she hadn't dreamed that the mysterious masked author would grant her an interview under such short notice. `
`The more she thought about it, the more she realized that the sum of the events leading to this meeting made for nothing short of a miracle. `
`...Yes. `
`A miracle. `
`...After all, in almost all cases, I'd never be contacted by the publishing company...and would leave for Niijima the next day. `
`......? `
`......I'd leave for Niijima, then go on to Rokkenjima. `
`...And then give Onee-chan...a Sakutarou stuffed animal. `
`...Huh? `
`......Why a Sakutarou stuffed animal......? `
`...... `
`My memory of the future...is all muddled... `
`My head...hurts... `
`Hachijo said something about showing Ange something good, rose from the sofa, and headed for the study desk. `
`When she turned her back, Amakusa asked Ange, who seemed to be troubled by something, if she was okay. `
`"...Hey, Amakusa. `
`...How...long have I been here...?" `
`"What? `
`You've been looking weird for a while now. `
`What's going on?" `
`"......I...can't remember how long I've been sitting here." `
`"Are you still half asleep?" `
`"That's not it. `
`...I mean, I was able to get an appointment with Professor Ootsuki, but the publishing company never got back to me about Itouikukuro, `
`...so in the end, I was stuck unable to do anything that entire day, ...right?" `
`"Huh?" `
`"Amakusa, ...you went to go get that large black bag, didn't you...?" `
`That's right. `
`Just before we left for Niijima, Amakusa and I parted ways just one time. `
`...He said something about getting a weapon from an acquaintance of his, and he went to go get that large black bag. `
`Wasn't that... `
`...today...? `
`What...am I talking about...? `
`I mean, `
`...didn't I go to Niijima, `
`...meet Captain Kawabata, `
`...and, inside the bed shop... `
`...huh? `
`......What...? `
`"...Something wrong...?" `
`Did my confusion and uncertainty make me sigh out loud...? `
`Even though Hachijo's back was to me, `
`...she slowly turned around...and smiled as though she had peered into my heart. `
`"...N- `
`No, it's nothing." `
`Strange memories, ...ones that even I can't understand... `
`I tried to hide my confusion, `
`......but for some reason, Hachijo had a strange glint in her eyes, ...as though she could read my mind. `
`"I have revived and killed your family several times within various forgeries. `
`...Almost like a witch might." `
`"Reviving and killing them whenever you like. `
`......Endlessly. `
`...Sounds almost like {f:5:Beatrice}, doesn't it..." `
`"Yes, it does. `
`...So, please follow the lead of all those people on the web... `
`and consider the possibility that I might be a witch." `
`She took a thickly-packed, brown envelope out of a locked drawer. `
`It appeared to be filled to the brim with printer paper. `
`...Perhaps this was a manuscript for one of her works. `
`The neat letters written with a fountain pen on the envelope... `
`...spelled out the word "Dawn". `
`There was no forgery by the name of Dawn. `
`...Which...must mean... `
`...Ange could tell. `
`This was a new one. `
`Hachijo's newest, unreleased forgery... `
`"Dawn of the Golden Witch"... `
`"For one such as I, who knows everything, everything is boring. `
`...However, I don't dislike letting the ignorant read my works to see what kind of reactions they have. `
`...And so, I want you to read it." `
`"...You want me to read your newest work, which you've created as the new Endless Witch?" `
`"Correct, child of man. `
`Whether you resent it or admire it, you can help me forget my illness for a time." `
`"...... `
`...Let's put an end to this farce, shall we? `
`...Who are you? `
`...I don't remember ever meeting you like this." `
`Yes, I did try to contact Hachijo Tohya. `
`But in the end, I never got a chance to meet her. `
`In other words, all of this is a falsehood. `
`"Whose piece am I this time? `
`...Sorry, but if you think you can tame Ushiromiya Ange so easily, `
`you're making a big mistake." `
`"...Pfft. `
`...*giggle*giggle*... `
`Yes, ...I hoped you'd be this interesting. `
`Heheheheheheheheheheh..." `
`She finally couldn't hold it back and burst out laughing... `
`Gradually, the space around them seemed to be filled with a strange purple mist... `
`The room itself seemed to twist and bend... `
`Her figure also twisted... `
`and after something that couldn't be described elapsed, her form changed to become just what she had called herself, `
`...a witch. `
`"Splendid. `
`You did well to see through my veil..." `
`"......It seems I'm the type witches just love to cling to. `
`......You all have that same condescending tone towards humans. `
`I figured you were a witch right away." `
`The novelist sitting on the sofa was nowhere to be seen. `
`Even Ange's bodyguard, who was supposed to be around at times like this, was gone. `
`There was only a nonhuman figure relaxing in a large, ornate rocking chair. `
`"I find you truly intriguing, child of man. `
`...Your charming nature is the perfect medicine for my boredom." `
`"Yeah, well, I don't see anything charming about this. `
`...Why am I alive? `
`...Wasn't I killed in a pretty nasty way for breaking the rule about revealing my name...?" `
`To be honest, ...I did doubt that those people would just let me go so easily. `
`...What kind of farce will I be forced to go along with this time? `
`I really don't care. `
`I'll just do whatever I can within the bounds of the role they give me, ...whatever I can to help Onii-chan. `
`Of course, I understand. `
`...Even if he wins, he'll never come back to "me". `
`"Even so, ...I'll struggle on. `
`I'll make sure Onii-chan comes back to the "me" of that day." `
`"No need to lose your temper. `
`I am not asking you to be a piece..." `
`"Then why did you summon me here? `
`Don't tell me you want me to read this new story or whatever it is you've written." `
`"That's it exactly. `
`...I do not want you to be my piece. `
`I have always been a mere observer, `
`and I have no intention of sticking my neck into their game..." `
`"...I don't get it. `
`What is it you want from me?" `
`"Be an observer for me. An observer of the Fragments {f:5:Beatrice} has woven." `
`"An observer...? `
`I don't really get it, but no deal." `
`"In the past, `
`I observed the Fragments through Battler's eyes. `
`...However, now that he has succeeded the position of Game Master, he is not a suitable observer. `
`I am following this tale with true and earnest intentions. `
`It would be such a waste to observe it through the eyes of Battler as he is now, like reading a detective novel backwards..." `
`"...Onii-chan is the Game Master?? `
`What on earth are you talking about?" `
`"You must have no clue what it's all about. `
`You want to know, don't you? `
`...I want to know too. `
`What kind of tale will Battler weave now that he has taken the position of Game Master? `
`...Furthermore, I wish to search for the truth Battler reached as part of my own mental journey. `
`......My illness affects me gravely. `
`If I do not think, I cannot even keep my heart beating..." `
`"......So, `
`...you want me to read your new picture book aloud to you...?" `
`"You might as well interpret it that way. `
`In exchange, you will also be able to take part in your own journey of the mind. `
`I do believe that even you have yet to reach the truth. `
`......I think you want to continue `
`on the journey to find that truth." `
`"I don't owe you anything." `
`"Do not push your luck. `
`I can be lenient at times, but such cases are rare..." `
`"............" `
`Ange hadn't yet reached the truth either. `
`Though she knew that the game was little more than a toy for the amusement of those witches, she wanted it to resume, ...so that she could follow the tale and close in on the "king" called truth... `
`"...I might explore the tale to find the truth for myself, `
`...but I have no obligation to read it aloud until the end for your sake. `
`...Understand?" `
`Ange was willing to read the story aloud, but she could quit at any time if this witch made her mad. `
`She was, in effect, warning the witch not to annoy her... `
`"Of course. `
`...You call it a picture book, but to me, it is the only medicine for a fatal illness. `
`I cannot take that medicine without you to assist me. `
`...In other words, it's a mutually beneficial arrangement." `
`"...So, you're telling me to read you a book until you fall asleep. `
`And in exchange, you'll let me read it too. `
`...Is that right?" `
`"Precisely. `
`...If you are willing to accept, `
`I shall ask that you become my Reader for a time." `
`"Well, it's nice to get my own title, but all you really want me to do is read books, right?" `
`"Becoming my Reader means the same as becoming my familiar. `
`...In other words, what is done against you will be done against me. `
`I will not permit anyone to disrupt my only interest, that being to read the rest of {f:5:Beatrice}'s tale. `
`...I will not let {f:5:Bernkastel}, {f:5:Lambdadelta}, `
`or even {f:5:Beatrice} force anything upon you..." `
`This witch, who seemed to have an almost divine quality to her, spoke both quietly and forcefully... `
`There was no threat in her words. `
`...However, even so, `
`it was clear that she was on a different level than {f:5:Bernkastel} and the other witches, and not at all to be taken lightly. `
`"So, you'll offer me protection if I agree to read your book...?" `
`"Of course. `
`What I want is for you to read aloud to me. `
`...I will not spare any who attempt to stand in the way of that." `
`"............" `
`"...If my attitude seems arrogant to you, allow me to apologize, child of man. `
`It may not seem so, but I am speaking to you with the utmost respect." `
`"Yeah, probably. `
`...Even that witch-like style of speech... `
`feels like it's got to be the most respectful thing you've said in the last few hundred years." `
`"When you're reading a book, do you tell it "thank you very much" before flipping through the pages...?" `
`"...I guess it is like that. `
`I understand." `
`Just by agreeing to have a conversation with Ange, she was showing an incredible amount of respect and willingness to compromise. `
`Ange shrugged, but she also nodded to show her consent. `
`"Sure. `
`...I'll be your Reader. `
`I get that you showed a ton of respect just by asking for my consent first." `
`"You understand well, child of man." `
`"...My name's Ange. `
`Not child of man or whatever." `
`"Heheheheheh. `
`...Very well. `
`As proof of my respect for you, I will acknowledge your name." `
`For her, acknowledging human names was like acknowledging the names of all the leaves scattered across the ground. `
`So, ...her acknowledging Ange's name was a miracle. `
`No, it was immensely good fortune. `
`"...From this point forth, Ushiromiya Ange will serve as Reader and {c:86EF8C:miko} `
`to the Witch of Theatergoing, {f:5:Featherine Augustus Aurora}. `
`Until you finish reading, `
`I shall bring calamity to all who attempt to hinder your task." `
`When the Witch of Theatergoing, {f:5:Featherine}, spoke this, ...Ange was wrapped in a bright light. `
`Ange didn't feel any particular change herself, `
`...but she definitely had been given something that only nonhumans could sense. `
`It signified that from this point forward, Ange would be the Witch of Theatergoing's subject. `
`That didn't mean that Ange would gain some sort of special power, `
`...but at the very least, it probably meant that anyone wanting to cause her harm would first have to take on {f:5:Featherine} herself... `
`"...Your name is pretty long. `
`Sounds like some Roman person from the history books. `
`...What should I call you?" `
`"Those not familiar with me call me {f:5:Augustus Aurora}." `
`"......After all the respect you've shown me, it's only fitting that I respond in kind. `
`I'll call you {f:5:Featherine}. `
`Any problems?" `
`"None at all. `
`...For an ailing witch such as myself, even being called by my first name will be an experience to be treasured and pondered over, child of man." `
`"I have a name. It's Ange." `
`"...Heheh. Even conversations like this are pleasant every once in a while. `
`...Ange, my miko." `
`Ange accepted her role. `
`She would observe this story with the Witch of Theatergoing. `
`The curtain was rising on the sixth tale... `
