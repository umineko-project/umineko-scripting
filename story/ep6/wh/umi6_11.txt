`Rosa could be seen in the parlor. `
`The relatives apparently all wanted to be alone after dispersing for a short break. `
`Since everyone avoided the parlor, the one place where people would normally gather, `
`Rosa was able to have this relaxing and comforting room all to herself... `
`That didn't mean she looked relaxed. `
`Her expression was heavy with gloom and weariness. `
`The cup of black tea that she had brought from the dining hall had gone cold... `
`"........." `
`...A pleasant silence. `
`Now that no one was in sight, Rosa's heart finally awoke. `
`She was always treated like a kid in the conferences with her three siblings. `
`She had no influence at all. `
`But, possibly because of that, she was apparently considered to be a neutral party. `
`The siblings would often ask for her agreement, sometimes even treating her like a referee or a judge. `
`"...I have to make use of that... `
`...and turn the discussion in the direction I want." `
`I have to find almost a hundred million yen by March. `
`That was supposed to be my great commitment, a burden I bore to help support "that man's" business. `
`Now, ...I'm not sure anymore. `
`If I can pay off my debt, ...will he call me again? `
`...Don't make me laugh. `
`Even if you do contact me after all this time, ...I'll be the one to refuse. `
`...But still, `
`...you're Maria's father... `
`Please come and see her, `
`...if only just once... `
`"...Love is quite a difficult thing... `
`...to stick to, isn't it?" `
`"Huh?! `
`...Wh-Who...?" `
`Though no one should have been in the parlor, someone suddenly spoke to Rosa, and she jumped. `
`...Just when did he get there... `
`Kanon could be seen standing there. `
`Even considering that she had been deep in thought, ...to think that she hadn't noticed him at all... `
`"...You startled me. `
`...Sorry, I guess I was thinking so hard that I didn't notice you. `
`...Do you need something?" `
`"No. `
`...The reason you are currently in pain is because of love, Rosa-sama. `
`...Am I wrong?" `
`"Th-That's sudden. `
`...I'm not sure what you're talking about." `
`"...Maria-sama's father wanted you to be the co-signer on a loan, `
`and you accepted, Rosa-sama." `
`"......... `
`...What a troublesome kid. `
`...You were listening to Krauss nii-san from the hallway, weren't you...?" `
`...True, earlier this day, in this very room, `
`Krauss had seen through to the fact that Rosa was bearing a massive debt because she'd become a co-signer on a loan. `
`However, he hadn't said that her partner had been Maria's father... `
`Why...did Kanon know so much...? `
`"You are a very wise person, Rosa-sama. `
`...You wouldn't have become a co-signer `
`without thinking carefully about the consequences." `
`"......I hadn't yet moved to his family register, `
`but I thought of the man I would soon marry as my partner. `
`If he couldn't borrow the money without my name, I figured that helping him out was my responsibility as his future wife." `
`"...And did that future ever come?" `
`"........." `
`No, it hadn't. `
`So afterwards, ...Rosa was always alone. `
`And Maria...never had a father. `
`However, time moved on. `
`Nothing changed, except that Maria, who should have been a symbol of their union, `
`just kept growing like a living hourglass measuring the length of the hell Rosa had crawled through... `
`Because of that, Maria's growth...hurt. `
`"...It's ironic. `
`...I tried to forget that man several times. `
`...But you know, forgetting him doesn't get rid of that debt." `
`It was only natural. `
`...That's why she had to forget her love `
`and do all she could to pay that money back. `
`"But you know, I also think of it this way. `
`...If I can manage to pay everything off, it'll mean that I've passed the trial of love that he gave me. `
`...I'll have to pay off my debt anyway, so how can I abandon my reward, the love I'll gain as a result, before it's over...? `
`Is it really so wrong to put off thinking about that until after I've paid my debts...?" `
`"........." `
`It may have been a trick of words that only those who have suffered through love could understand. `
`Even Rosa was vaguely aware of the possibility that she'd been deceived. `
`However, if she was able to succeed in paying back the loan, ...he might acknowledge her usefulness as a wife... `
`When that happened, she might be able to regain that love. `
`And if she abandoned that love? `
`...This debt, this "trial that he had given her", would become completely meaningless... `
`Yes, for her, ...the debt itself appeared to be a trial of love. `
`Actually, the very fact that she tried to view it that way might have been the blindness of love, `
`proof that she was still bound by her regrets and obsessed with the past... `
`That pain still continued within her... `
`At the very least, ...it would remain until she paid back that massive loan, `
`and even then, it would take quite some time before she'd be able to lay her feelings for him to rest... `
`"......Could this be...that hell Kyrie-sama spoke of?" `
`"...I see. `
`...I'm not sure what you're talking about, `
`...but there's no doubt that my world has been hell through and through." `
`"And how can that be put to an end...?" `
`"...Who knows? `
`If anyone did, ...no one would ever be crushed by the disease of love." `
`That disease is a serious one. `
`...It sometimes eats into a person for their entire life, ...spreading to and hurting the people closest to them. `
`That disease was torturing her now as much as it ever had... `
`"Well, since you bring up Kyrie-san, `
`...her story is like a wish or a dream to me." `
`Though she had her man stolen from her, she persevered for 18 years. `
`She never fell to despair, and instead continued to support Rudolf, keeping her head down and waiting for a miracle... `
`"Maria is still nine years old. `
`...I've only waited as long as the first half of Kyrie's 18 years. `
`...If I gave up after just this, ...she would laugh at me." `
`"...Do you think a miracle will occur within nine years?" `
`"...... `
`...If I doubt that, it's all over." `
`"........." `
`"In a sense, I'm a ghost. `
`...I'm already dead. `
`I'm just living on without noticing." `
`"...A ghost waiting for eternity for a person who will never come..." `
`"That's right. `
`...That day, when I naively said that I wanted to support his dream, I was probably already dead. `
`......I guess that really was a regretful day, in the end. `
`'I have dreams. I want to go overseas. `
`I'll fly out of this tiny country, make it big, and come back to you'. `
`...That takes me back..." `
`...At that time, I thought of lovers as a pair of people willing to acknowledge each other's radical dreams. `
`That's why he would always happily cheer me up by talking about how I'd become a successful designer, `
`traveling to Paris to release a new line and getting jostled by the press. `
`When I think about it, ...I really had my head in the clouds during that strange time. `
`......We both lifted the other up, as though we were drifting about in the air. `
`So, when he said that he wanted to get out of Japan, I applauded him and promised to support him. `
`Acknowledging each other's great dreams with nothing but words is a classic sort of pillow talk between lovers. `
`However, when it comes to actually carrying them out, ...you need to be more serious and calculating. `
`"...For a long time, I felt proud of letting him go on that day. `
`...No, I still do." `
`"...... `
`...But you still regret it." `
`"......That's right. `
`......If I had sobbed and told him to stop on that day, I might not have fallen into hell. `
`...Seeing him off with a smile was my victory? `
`Of course not. `
`It's as though I lost by default by refusing to fight when the time came." `
`"...I only glorified that loss, ...saw him off with a smile as he went to take on the world overseas, `
`and became intoxicated with the illusion that I was some brave woman waiting patiently for her man's return with her daughter. `
`......Even though I didn't get a single call from him, and mail sent to the address he'd given me came back "forwarding address unknown"..." `
`"........." `
`"...This is hell. `
`...In this hell, I'll regret not fighting when I should have until the day I die. `
`...I've even dragged my daughter into it. `
`......I wish someone would just kill me. `
`...I want to be told that I've already been killed, that I'm a ghost." `
`"......In love, `
`...if you do not fight, `
`...you have to crawl through hell." `
`"...Yes. Love is a fight." `
`"Will you win and gain, `
`or lose and die?" `
`"But please, have no fear of death." `
`"After all, it's a peaceful sleep." `
`""What's truly terrifying... `
`is the hell where you find the unsleeping ghosts of those who couldn't win, yet couldn't die."" `
`"...That hell has no end..." `
`"The battle of love is cruelest for those who never even fought, `
`but weren't able to die either." `
`"...So in love, you've gotta make it or break it. `
`Dying in battle like that...is liberating." `
`"They say the most torturous toxin for humans is made from love grown stale. `
`...The suffering it brings...exceeds the tortures of the most twisted hells." `
`She used this knowledge to try and embolden her double and little sister, `
`encouraging her to take on any trial no matter how fierce... `
`"......I understand." `
`After all, when my desire to have Battler-san accept me one day wells up in my chest, `
`...I can feel the seed that resides there. `
`"...It is up to me to kill that seed or make it bud. `
`...However, if I let it rot here in my chest, ...that poison will surely torment me forever..." `
`"And that......is the most fearsome torture in the world, `
`even for us thousand-year-old witches..." `
`"See what happens to those who make light of love! `
`This hell of Rosa's-" `
`"Is what happens to those who do not possess the courage to make the seed of love bud, and instead allow it to rot." `
`""One cannot end that pain by their own hands."" `
`......Huh? `
`...Just now...was that a red light...? `
`"......Pardon me." `
`"...Huh...? `
`...What......?" `
`Just now... `
`I thought... `
`...I saw something strange. `
`...I wonder if I'm tired... `
`...It's probably just my imagination. `
`Rosa picked up her cup of cold tea. `
`When she did, `
`...she saw a small... `
`...red rose petal float to the surface. `
`... `
`... `
`A `
`... `
`... `
`rose `
`... `
`... `
`... `
`... `
`... `
`? `
`"......I have heard that, in your youth, `
`...you loved to lie on that sofa." `
`"........." `
`It... `
`...wasn't a rose petal. `
`It was... `
`...a drop of blood... `
`...that had fallen from Rosa's eyes. `
`In an instant, `
`...Kanon had beautifully and precisely... `
`...cut just a single thread of Rosa's life... `
`There was no wound on Rosa's body. `
`However, ...several drops of blood...dripped down from her eyes. `
`Her pain, her uncertainties, and her worries...were all gone now. `
`Slowly, ...she fell down onto her side on the sofa. `
`This had been one of the happiest things she had done during the happiest day of her life... `
`"Sleep well, ...Rosa-sama. `
`...Your hell...has ended." `
`Kanon took a blanket out of a cupboard... `
`...and gently covered Rosa with it... `
`To anyone, `
`...it would have looked just as though Rosa was sleeping peacefully... `
`...Those demons had not exaggerated when calling this trial a battle of love. `
`It was at least accurate on this cruel but unassailable fact: `
`that those who have their love shattered meet with death... `
`"...Now, my part is complete. `
`...Did you see that, demons?" `
`"...D-Damn..." `
`"You dare to kill my Mama?!! `
`YOU DARE TO KILL MY MAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH?!!!" `
`One of the two great witches of Mariage Sorciere, {f:5:Maria}... `
`Though she was just an apprentice, the power sleeping within her had impressed even {f:5:Beatrice} at the height of her strength. `
`In {f:5:Maria}'s eyes, though Rosa may have been the black witch, `
`...she was also the vessel of the mother she couldn't help but love. `
`Her anger at having that stolen from her was near madness. `
`"You dare to...Mama, Mama, Mama!! `
`Nngggyyyyyyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!" `
`{f:5:Maria}'s attack was too emotional. `
`Because of this, she didn't notice that Kanon had vanished for several heartbeats, `
`and she released her barrage at what had become empty space. `
`In the meantime, Kanon jumped from wall to wall, around to {f:5:Maria}'s back... `
`"...Huh...h...?" `
`"...I don't want to kill past my quota. `
`...But I'll clean up the messes I've made...!!" `
`"......Uryuu." `
`"...Wh- `
`What are... `
`...you-" `
`"...Diplomatic immunity! `
`...I won't let you target {f:5:Maria} or me...!" `
`"D-Damn......" `
`The red curved blade extending from Kanon's hand vanished in an instant. `
`He tried hard to make it reappear, but when he attempted to use it on {f:5:Maria} and Sakutarou again, it vanished once more. `
`Because of Sakutarou's power, he was unable to make either of them the target of his attacks. `
`"...There you are. `
`...How long have you been there...?" `
`"Uryuu... `
`...I won't let anyone bully {f:5:Maria}." `
`"...D-Dammit...!" `
`{f:5:Maria} finally noticed where Kanon was, and she slowly turned around... `
`Kanon made his sword materialize yet again, `
`but no matter how often he tried, it kept fading out, like a flashlight with a bad battery... `
`"I won't let you get away now... `
`...I won't forgive you...for the sin of stealing my Mama away... `
`...I'll kill you. `
`...Just like Mama killed all of them, ...I'll kill you without mercy!!!" `
`As {f:5:Maria} howled, the entire parlor was surrounded by a cube of red, magic barriers. `
`It was a closed room symbolizing a barrier that Kanon could never escape. `
`"...D-Dammiiiiiit...!! `
`Not...here...!" `
`Kanon cursed his bad luck. `
`Even though he had fulfilled his goal in the demons' trial, `
`...if he was killed here, he'd be dragged off the game board...! `
`"...{f:5:Maria}, `
`...don't overdo it." `
`"Yeah, I won't overdo it. `
`...I'll be a little more gentle than Mama was. `
`...Kuhihihihihihihhi, `
`hahahahahaahahahahaah `
`hahaahahahahahahyahahaaaaaaaaaahh!!!" `
`"...?!?!" `
`"Uryu, who is it?!" `
`"...Pardon me, Maria-sama... `
`In accordance with the contract with Zepar-sama and Furfur-sama, I come for your life...!" `
`"Shannon, ...don't get... `
`...in my waaaaaaaaaaaaayyy!!" `
`"It's pointless, Shannon. `
`...I won't let anyone target {f:5:Maria}...!" `
`"Yes. `
`I don't intend to target her in any way. `
`...I will simply protect myself." `
`A cylindrical red magical barrier surrounded Shannon as she stood in the center of the parlor. `
`She made its brightness and thickness grow, and its radius suddenly expanded, filling up the room. `
`It wasn't targeting {f:5:Maria}. `
`This power was being wielded to protect Shannon's body. `
`So, Sakutarou's power didn't make it disappear. `
`"......N-Nee-san..." `
`"Would you let your feelings for Milady collapse in a situation like this? `
`...Get ahold of yourself...!" `
`"Ugh, ...ghgh, gghh......!!" `
`"Uryu...uu......!!" `
`By now, the shield with Shannon at the center had covered up the entire room. `
`Its power crushed {f:5:Maria} and Sakutarou into the corner. `
`Ironically, they were perfectly wedged between Shannon's barrier and the closed room barrier {f:5:Maria} had set up to prevent Kanon from escaping. `
`"...No...good... `
`...Can't...escape..." `
`"...*cackle*cackle* Kuhihihihihihiihihihihhihihiihi!! `
`I see, this is a closed room... `
`...Kihihihihihihihihihihi! `
`This might be just perfect for that wannabe detective who's trying to deny Beato's magic." `
`"......Checkmate, Maria-sama. `
`...Is that acceptable?" `
`"Yeah, it's fine!! Crush me! `
`...Kihhihhihhihhihhihhihhii!!" `
`"Then here it comes...!" `
`The entire room was filled with the red light of the shield, ...and the output and pressure were raised to their limits. `
`...Then, crushed between the shield and their own closed room barrier, `
`...{f:5:Maria} and Sakutarou lost their forms, scattered into a golden splash, and disappeared... `
`"...Thank you. `
`...I couldn't afford to disappear here." `
`"If you lost in a place like this, you wouldn't be able to let it go." `
`"...Yeah. `
`I wouldn't give up if I lost in a place like this." `
`"Zepar-sama, Furfur-sama. `
`We have both finished our trials. `
`Is that satisfactory...?" `
`"Yeah, truly splendid! `
`No complaints for either of you!" `
`"Then shall we finish with {f:5:Beatrice}'s turn...? `
`Oh, where did she go?" `
`"To the victim she's chosen, of course." `
`""Then let's go there as well!"" `
`...Natsuhi could be seen in her personal room. `
`Krauss had told her to go to bed, `
`but she couldn't afford to lie around sleeping on an important day like this. `
`However, she realized that she was the type to get excited easily, `
`and that this sometimes held her husband back... `
`So, `
`...though she didn't like it one bit, `
`...there was no way around it... `
`It was probably close to the time for the break to end, and the family conference would begin once again in the dining hall. `
`Her husband would have to protect the Ushiromiya family honor from those greedy siblings...all by himself. `
`If she grew emotional by his side, she would just tie him down. `
`...Though she knew that quietly waiting here was the best way she could support him, ...that didn't make the waiting any easier. `
`Natsuhi pulled a small treasure box out of a drawer. `
`This was her secret box. `
`Inside was everything from valuable items to mere rubbish. `
`...However, they were all precious, memorable treasures in Natsuhi's eyes. `
`She pulled a small pouch out of the box. `
`She stuck her hand inside it. `
`...It was a kind of charm that her own family had given her when she had married. `
`...A spirit mirror to ward off evil. `
`Her own face was reflected in it. `
`...Youth doesn't last forever. `
`Recently, she'd seen a bit of her parents and grandparents on her own face. `
`So by staring at her reflection in the mirror like this, `
`she felt as though her soul had returned to the family she'd been born into... `
`"...Dad, ...Mom... `
`...I've always been so ignorant...and unable to support my husband..." `
`Of course, her face in the mirror did not answer... `
`However, Natsuhi continued. `
`"...I wait here alone because I love my husband. `
`...However, I think love means being close to one another. `
`...Though I understand logically that staying here is the best way I can help him, `
`...I still feel wretched for doing it... `
`......It's tough, isn't it? ...Waiting for the sake of love..." `
`With a *plop*, ...a tear fell onto the mirror. `
`Old, dear memories of her life at her parents' house rose up inside her. `
`Now was the time...for her to follow her parents' example... `
`When her father came home late, her mother would always sit up straight waiting for him, prepared for him to arrive at any moment. `
`...She would always wait for him, kneeling in the entrance hall, `
`and no matter how late he came home, she would always wake up all the children and line them up to greet him. `
`At the time, I only thought of her as being exceptionally strict, `
`......but at this age, I finally understand how strong she was, persevering in her love for her beloved husband even after being left in charge of the house while he was out. `
`"Because of your love for your husband, `
`...you couldn't bear to be made to care for an unfamiliar child." `
`"...?!?!" `
`The sudden voice made Natsuhi jump up and look about the room. `
`When she did, ... `
`there was a western lady wrapped in an extravagant dress. `
`"...Wh-Who are you?!" `
`"........." `
`Natsuhi was confused. `
`There was no one like this in this mansion. `
`However, though this was her first time seeing this person, it felt as though she had seen her somewhere else... `
`Her mind had gone blank with anger at the ruffian who had snuck into her private room...and confusion over the appearance of someone she didn't know, `
`...so it took quite some time before she realized that this was the witch of the portrait. `
`"...Though you murdered a baby you didn't know on that day 19 years ago, I will not hold that sin against you." `
`"...Wh- `
`What are... `
`you `
`... `
`talking about...?" `
`Beato had chosen Natsuhi as her sacrifice. `
`She was "Battler's" enemy. `
`Beato didn't know much about the details of Battler's birth. `
`......However, she knew about the Fragment from the previous game, `
`and knew there was a chance that Battler was the baby that Natsuhi had pushed off a cliff 19 years ago. `
`Battler had used this blue wedge to protect Natsuhi from certain false charges, `
`...but if you took it as a confession by Battler himself, `
`then from Beato's position, Natsuhi was an enemy who probably forced Battler to live a painful life. `
`"You killed that baby, who lacked your husband's blood, for the sake of your love for your husband. So, also for the sake of love, I will not hold it against you." `
`"I don't...have a clue what you're talking about!! `
`Get out!! This is my room!!" `
`"Therefore, `
`...please do not hold it against me when I kill you for the sake of my love." `
`Beato slowly stuck out her arms...and made as if to grab something in empty space. `
`...That grab...bound itself around Natsuhi's neck. `
`"Ggh... `
`...ah... `
`...eh......" `
`Natsuhi's heels lifted up, and a faint, purple shape appeared around her neck... `
`Natsuhi frantically scratched at her neck, trying to stop whatever was strangling her, but there was nothing there. `
`...So, to an outsider, it just looked as though Natsuhi was standing on her toes in anguish, scratching at her own neck. `
`"...Both pairs of lovers have shown their determination. `
`...I do not think...that my love for Battler-san is inferior to theirs... `
`...Just as I will not blame you for your sin of 19 years ago, ...I will not blame myself for this sin...!" `
`"......Eh `
`......gah `
`...gghh......" `
`As Natsuhi twisted in agony, something she had been grasping fell from her grip. `
`Since it had fallen by her feet, Beato dropped her gaze to see what it was... `
`...It was...Natsuhi's spirit mirror. `
`When she peered into it, ......there was a sound like a burst of electricity. `
`That sound released Natsuhi from the invisible hands... `
`and made Beato topple backwards like a doll. `
`"*cough*...*cough*cough*...? `
`......?!??" `
`Coughing, Natsuhi tried to comprehend what was going on around her. `
`Beato rolled over and, dizzy as though she had just bumped her head, `
`she slowly tried to stand up. `
`Her eyes were bewildered, as though even she didn't really understand what had happened. `
`"...Wh-What... `
`...what is this...?" `
`"That is...surprising... `
`You could touch spiderwebs without trouble, ...but you can't handle the spirit mirror...?" `
`"E-Even I...don't have a clue what's happening... `
`What in the world..." `
`She had thought that only Beato the elder possessed nonhuman weak points, `
`such as getting burned by spiderwebs and wards and having her power sealed by spirit mirrors. `
`However, ...for some reason, this spirit mirror alone could apparently affect Beato as well. `
`Even Beato couldn't understand what about the spirit mirror had had such an overpowering effect on her. `
`".........!!" `
`But Natsuhi was different. `
`She instantly realized that the reason for the hesitation of this unearthly being, this witch of the portrait, ...must be the power of the mirror. `
`So, she rapidly crawled across the floor and picked it up. `
`Then, she stuck it out so that Beato could see it... `
`...Beato still didn't know what was happening, `
`so, still sitting down, she looked straight at it. `
`And this time, both of them understood the situation completely. `
`Beato realized that the mirror was working some hateful power against her. `
`And Natsuhi realized that the spirit mirror had the power to repel witches. `
`"...Gghh...uuuuuhhh...!! `
`Wh-Why is...the mirror...?!" `
`"It's because you're an evil witch. `
`......This miraculous spirit mirror repels all creatures of evil...!" `
`"......Don't...point it at me...!" `
`With the spirit mirror still held out, Natsuhi cautiously closed the gap between them. `
`She was cautious, so as to prevent the other from suddenly lashing out and stealing the mirror, ...but she steadily moved to corner this evil. `
`"I-I do not know who you are. `
`...All I know is that you tried to kill me. `
`And I know that you are a creature of evil, fearful of this spirit mirror. `
`...Begone, evil one...!!" `
`Beato didn't understand what was happening herself. `
`...She didn't know why she had to fear this spirit mirror. `
`However, when she tried to look at the bright light let off by the spirit mirror, it pierced her eyes. `
`Though she didn't understand why she must be afraid, she did understand that she must be afraid. `
`By now, Beato realized that this spirit mirror was both terrifying and harmful. `
`As it came closer to her, she felt an increasingly strong and painful burning sensation over her whole body, as though someone was approaching her with a hot iron. `
`She couldn't even open her eyes because of the mirror's bright, painful glint... `
`"Uuuuu... `
`...ah... `
`...aaaaaaaahhh...ah..." `
`"Go, return to the world from whence you came, evil one! `
`I, Ushiromiya Natsuhi, do not fear evil in the least!" `
`...It's...no use... `
`...Why...? `
`Why is this...musty mirror...so... `
`I- `
`If I lose here, `
`...I'll be the only one... `
`...to fail this trial... `
`Just like `
`George-san and Shannon-san... `
`and Jessica-san and Kanon-san, `
`...I also want Battler-san to acknowledge me... `
`...and treasure me... `
`And... `
`...even though I've finally managed to be honest with myself, `
`...in a place like this... `
`...I alone will be... `
`"Are you giving up?! `
`Only you?!" `
`"Believe! `
`A miracle of love will surely occur!" `
`...I... `
`love... `
`...Battler-san... `
`I want him to notice me. `
`And I want him to acknowledge and accept my feelings... `
`If my reason for calling him Father and dedicating myself to him... `
`...was out of duty towards a parent of mine, I would have been satisfied with no reward... `
`That was...a deception I used to fool myself... `
`...I...love Battler-san. `
`And I want him to acknowledge it. `
`I accept it. `
`I won't turn away any longer. `
`...I was born because I love Battler-san, ...and I want him to love me back... `
`"...And so, `
`...I cannot lose... `
`...here..." `
`"Begone, evil one!! `
`There is no place for you here!" `
`"Nng, ...gwaah...!!!" `
`Her determination had come too late. `
`If she'd had it from the start, ...she would probably have managed to finish Natsuhi off right then without any fear. `
`Because she had wavered, it had taken time to kill Natsuhi, ...and things had ended up like this. `
`But now, I am resolved. `
`I want to love Battler-san. `
`I want him to love me. `
`"...And so...I cannot lose here...! `
`After all, ...I was born for Battler-san's sake...!!" `
`"Yes, that is-" `
`"What we wanted to hear." `
`"......Ah...?!" `
`Just after a sound like a beetle banging off all the walls filled the room, `
`the spirit mirror was knocked out of Natsuhi's outstretched hand. `
`It fell to the floor, `
`...and the stake flying around the room pierced through it with a crash. `
`"Lucifer of Pride, right here! `
`...You dare mock me by choosing a single old mirror to be my first target in so long?" `
`"......Huh?! `
`Ah, ...Lucifer...san...?" `
`"{f:5:Beatrice}-sama, you must complete your trial...! `
`She's getting away...!" `
`"...S-Someone!! `
`Help me!! `
`Someoooooooone!!" `
`Now that the spirit mirror, her last ray of hope, had been smashed, and the number of strange demons had increased, Natsuhi could do nothing but run for it. `
`However, if she made a scene and people gathered, the anti-magic toxin would burn Beato. `
`Now was her last chance. `
`"...Th-Thank you, Lucifer-san...! `
`......P-Prepare yourself, Ushiromiya Natsuhi...!" `
`"......Gggah!! `
`Ghghhgg...kk..." `
`Once again, Beato choked the thin air. `
`This time, she wouldn't let her escape. `
`She had to end Natsuhi's pain right away before it got too drawn out. `
`...But...her power wasn't...enough... `
`Though Natsuhi scratched at her neck, she also struggled to escape from the room. `
`...Her shaking hand...stretched out...to the lock on the door. `
`A closed room is one of the concepts that allows a witch to be a witch. `
`Just unlocking the door strengthened the anti-magic toxin a little. `
`Since Beato was at her limit even within a closed room, if Natsuhi undid that lock, `
`...Beato's power would weaken immediately, and Natsuhi would surely escape into the hallway. `
`Their strengths were matched. `
`However, Natsuhi's began to surpass Beato's slightly... `
`The power of the living to live is fundamentally stronger than the power of magic. `
`Of course, Beato was mustering all her might. `
`However, ...Natsuhi was just a bit stronger... `
`"......That's enough. `
`...Lucifer, do it." `
`"A-As you wish!" `
`Lucifer transformed into a stake, and like the time she had smashed Natsuhi's spirit mirror, flew violently around the room. `
`...Then, she struck Natsuhi's forehead. `
`Natsuhi...crumpled slowly. `
`When Beato saw this, she also fell to her knees, breathing hard. `
`"Hey, Zepar! `
`Does this count? `
`{f:5:Beatrice} didn't complete the trial by her own strength alone, right?!" `
`"That's right, Furfur! `
`True, this trial must be accomplished without borrowing the help of any other!" `
`"But maybe this is an exception?!" `
`""A pair in love are as one! `
`This doesn't count as help from outside!"" `
`"......B-Battler-san..." `
`"Did you really have to scare me like that as soon as the first twilight?" `
`"...M-My apologies... `
`Sorry I didn't listen to your instructions..." `
`"Instructions?" `
`"...Well, ...I didn't stay in my room..." `
`Beato hung her head apologetically. `
`...When he saw this, Battler scratched his head uncomfortably. `
`"In that case, ...I should apologize too. `
`...I should've chosen my words more carefully." `
`"N- `
`No, you did nothing wrong, `
`...Father. `
`...I-I mean, ...Battler-san..." `
`"It's okay. Call me whatever you like." `
`"Huh......?" `
`Battler had always looked at the new {f:5:Beatrice} sternly. `
`However, that was gone from his expression now... `
`"...True, the old you may have called me just "Battler". `
`...At first, I might have tried to force you to speak to me that way. `
`...But that would be pointless. `
`You are Beato, ...but you're still you. `
`...You can call me whatever you want." `
`"...B-Battler-san..." `
`"Sure, that works great. `
`...Can't say being called Father is really my thing." `
`"...Y-Yes..." `
`Earlier, she had hesitated just to say Battler's name at all. `
`If Battler had told her to say his name without honorifics, she couldn't have done so right now, `
`......and even if she had, that might have hurt Battler even more. `
`However, ...now, she was allowed to call Battler by his name. `
`You just had to look into her eyes... `
`to see how happy this made her... `
`"I heard from Zepar and Furfur. `
`...It seems a strange game has been started." `
`"Y-Yes... `
`Sorry for getting involved all on my own..." `
`"No problem. `
`That reckless way you leap in before you understand is really like you. `
`...And...uh, well, I've heard about the theme of this game. `
`Apparently, you're supposed to play it in pairs." `
`"Yes, that is correct, Lord {f:5:Battler}!!" `
`"If you can succeed in winning through our trial...!" `
`""We will bless the pair of you and bestow a miracle of magic upon you!"" `
`"It seems these guys have been giving their power to Beato's golden butterfly brooch. `
`That means its effectiveness is guaranteed. `
`...We've been stuck with each other for a long time now. `
`Nothing wrong with playing this sort of game every now and then." `
`"...Battler-san......" `
`"Oh, did you hear that, Furfur?! `
`It looks like Lord {f:5:Battler} is joining in as well!!" `
`"That's no surprise! `
`After all, we've known since the beginning!" `
`""Welcome to our trial, Lord {f:5:Battler}! `
`So, who will your sacrifice be?!"" `
`"...I've already done my part. `
`Go and check if you want." `
`"Very well, Lord {f:5:Battler}! `
`Come, Furfur, let's go check!" `
`"Yes, let's! `
`But Zepar? `
`This means that all six lovers have succeeded in their trials, right? `
`What should we do next?!" `
`""The resolve of all six is the real deal! `
`Let us test them further in the next trial!"" `
`The two noisy demons disappeared. `
`They had apparently left to go check on the sacrifice Battler had killed... `
`and also so that Battler and Beato, who could finally look each other in the eye and talk, could have some time alone... `
`"...What do you think of the tale so far...?" `
`When suddenly asked this question, Ange immediately came to her senses... `
`Then, she realized that she had been immersed in Hachijo's tale. `
`She felt a bit defeated and tried to look displeased. `
`"...Y-You cleverly tried to distract us with this love trial stuff, `
`but exactly six people have died, setting up the first twilight. `
`Impressive." `
`"Oh, you're right. `
`I hadn't realized." `
`Amakusa clapped his hands as though he'd been outsmarted. `
`Even though he figured it out before me, he played the fool. `
`"...That's simply because the number of lovers just happened to be six. `
`The fact that it matched to the number of the first twilight was half coincidence, half design. `
`...It's a bit more interesting that way. Feels more like fate." `
`"Humans have the bad habit of taking two meaningless phenomena and trying to link them together. `
`Trying to make things seem like fate is a "trick" of books." `
`"I guess you aren't a fan of destiny and miracles, Lady." `
`"It's like UFOs. `
`Everyone knows about them, but no one has ever seen them." `
`"There's a <cool> metaphor." `
`"...So. `
`Normally, I'd try to skip over all the love and illusions and call them unnecessary, useless scenes for the mystery." `
`"...But Okonogi-san disagreed with that way of thinking. `
`He thought that, by looking at things without love that way, the truth could never be reached." `
`"Ah, you mean President Okonogi's catch phrase? `
`Without love, it cannot be "seen"?" `
`"Yeah, that. `
`...If I put aside my anger at the person who killed my family in a story... `
`and even speak with respect for Madam Hachijo, the one who wrote this tale, then there must be a point to this depiction. `
`After all, she's used up all these pages talking about love and trials. `
`...In other words, those are the themes and key words of this tale." `
`"...Oho. `
`...And there are many who claim that all words not written in red ink are not worth reading. `
`...It is an honor, child of man, `
`that you have read the black letters as well." `
`"Stories are written because the writer has something they want to communicate. `
`And some writers feel that it's unrefined to lay everything out too directly. `
`......All of this about how you'll never reach the truth without love has shown up many times in the works before this one. `
`This new work makes that even more striking. `
`...It means that that is the one thing the writer wanted to tell the most, ...the thing that they want us to think about the most." `
`...When you think about it, there have been many scenes about love ever since Beato first appeared. `
`Even the first time she appeared before Shannon, she spoke clearly about how love was the single element of the world. `
`And the golden butterfly brooch she had given...was also an item for love. `
`She had said that she enjoyed sowing seeds of love and watching complications arise, `
`and when Shannon stopped borrowing her power, the reason for her argument was also love. `
`...After her interactions with Battler started up in full, scenes about love were toned down for a while, `
`...but the "without love, it cannot be seen" definition of magic has been mentioned repeatedly. `
`Then, in the tale right before this one, when Beato became like a doll, `
`several scenes made it seem almost as though Battler and Beato had accepted each other as rivals, ...or possibly something more. `
`In the end, Battler had regained some memory, and his impression of Beato had undergone a complete change. `
`...And then, in this game... `
`From the beginning until now, the word "love" has been repeated over and over again. `
`"The tale you wrote keeps talking about love. `
`However, that's not Maria onee-chan's viewpoint or {f:5:Beatrice}'s viewpoint. `
`...It's Hachijo Tohya's viewpoint." `
`"...Correct. `
`That is what I wanted to tell. `
`And it is my own sort of "answer"." `
`"Answer? `
`...Then all of the crimes 12 years ago were a trial of love started by strange demons?" `
`"Ridiculous. `
`I didn't come here to read a romance novel you wrote. `
`...What I want to know about is the truth you claim to have reached." `
`"...Foolish child of man. `
`...After reading all of this, do you still not understand?" `
`With an obviously condescending gaze, Hachijo shrugged. `
`It was clear that she was trying to provoke Ange. `
`She was probably hinting that Ange should just go home if she was annoyed. `
`'If you're going to read my noble work and not even attempt to see whether you understand it, `
`then get out'. `
`...Normally, Ange would already have thrown a fit and left. `
`However, ...she couldn't do that. `
`Though she didn't like someone else toying with her family's fates in a story, `
`...she was growing increasingly certain of something else as she read through it. `
`...Just as Hachijo's followers said, `
`...this tale really does have the same presence...the same scent as the tales written by {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`The author was certainly different. `
`However, because it reached to the real truth, it had the same scent... `
`Ange was beginning to acknowledge this. `
`...Hachijo Tohya...was one who had reached {f:5:Beatrice}'s truth, `
`......an "Endless Witch" like {f:5:Beatrice}, who could add to the endlessly stretching parallel worlds of the cat box... `
`"...If one has reached {f:5:Beatrice}'s truth, `
`...they can create a new tale, whoever they are. `
`...With this new manuscript, I'm sure someone besides myself will appear and reach the truth. `
`...Those people will be qualified to create new tales of their own." `
`"So there will be more and more Endless Witches..." `
`"Yes. `
`And these many Endless Witches will add to {f:5:Beatrice}'s cat box tale. `
`...The more they add to it, the more people will reach the truth... `
`...When that happens, the very first Endless Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, will finally be rewarded for writing such long letters, packing them in bottles, and throwing them into the sea..." `
`"........." `
`"...You might have yelled at me angrily and risen from your seat. `
`However, you did not. `
`......Why?" `
`"I hate to admit it, `
`...but I'm starting to think that your tale has some kind of truth or hint within it." `
`I already have my own ideas. `
`However, that's no more than looking with a single eye. `
`Unless I accept a different viewpoint from my own and look at things from more than one angle, I'll never be able to see the truth in three dimensions. `
`That's my interpretation of "without love, it cannot be seen". `
`"Very well, child of man. `
`...Perhaps, as the final survivor of the Ushiromiya family, `
`it was fated that you would find the truth and become an Endless Witch. `
`...I exist only as a guidepost to awaken you as the true Successor, `
`...{f:5:Ange Beatrice}." `
`Sometimes, I don't understand what she's saying... `
`However, she knows something. `
`And maybe...she actually has reached the truth, as she claims... `
`...In other words, I didn't learn the truth even after reading the two message bottles {f:5:Beatrice} left behind, `
`...and I'm now reading tale after tale filled with hints. `
`"So, ...these hints are challenges, provoking me to think." `
`"......Indeed." `
`"Perfect. `
`...I'll find this truth you say you've reached. `
`...It's a good thing I came here." `
`"That it is. `
`...I invited you here because you hadn't found it yet, child of man..." `
`Let the truth I "see" and the truth you "see" overlap. `
`Just as you see things with a single eye, so do I. `
`Now that I've found you, I can finally "see" the truth with both eyes. `
`"Fwaaah...aaaahhh... `
`So, the first twilight has fiiinally happened. `
`Everything so far's made me so sleepy." `
`"...You have some sleep in your eye." `
`"Huh? Wh-Where... `
`...M-Mind your own your business!" `
`"...Hmph. `
`As you wish, let's begin. `
`...First off, the first twilight." `
