`"......Lambda, ...where are you...?" `
`Just having to say that felt like admitting defeat, ...and I didn't like it. `
`Why is it that she's always so obnoxious and clingy when I don't need her, `
`...and then won't answer when I call her name? `
`Where...am I...? `
`Annoyed by the completely predictable ending, I'd left the cathedral. `
`...I'd planned on finding some terrace with a cool night's breeze `
`to kill time on until the end of that farcical reception. `
`"...It's true that I tried to find somewhere desolate so that I wouldn't have to look at people, `
`...but this is a bit ridiculous." `
`I, the great Bernkastel, ...am lost? `
`A miracle like that certainly wouldn't happen. `
`Yes, ...miracles don't exist in this world. `
`To create a miracle, you need "an amount of time that can never be reached", a period that's no different from infinity. `
`So, when something that appears to be a miracle happens in a shorter span of time than that, `
`...it is not a miracle, `
`but the product of someone's...design. `
`"In other words, ...the reason I'm walking down this corridor... `
`is because someone's design has forced me here... `
`"...Who? `
`Who would have pulled such a complicated prank on me? `
`......It looks like you're quite the shy one, `
`...calling me out to a desolate place like this." `
`...Then, ...from the other end of the dark corridor, ...I heard a sound. `
`*patter*, *patter*patter*patter*... `
`It sounded as though some small animal, like a dog or a cat, was walking at a quick pace. `
`No miracle could cause a dog or cat to be in a place like this. `
`Such a miracle would not be "allowed". `
`Since it isn't a miracle, `
`that means I'm being guided in that direction. `
`...Very well. `
`This might be some new theme to keep me entertained. `
`If this is some new joke of Lambda's, I'll cover her whole body with honey using my tongue as a reward. `
`...And then, I'll stick parasol chocolates into her eyes and tell her to never do it again. `
`In the direction the noise had come from, ...it was not only dim, but shrouded in complete darkness. `
`However, ...I could sense something in that darkness. `
`...There were two emerald green glints, ...probably cat eyes. `
`The eyes of a black cat that peered through the darkness. `
`"Are you the one who called me here...? `
`......Or...are you just the messenger...? ........." `
`When I looked at my feet, ...I saw red cat footprints leading towards those cat eyes. `
`...The marks were unsettling, ...as though the cat had run through a pool of blood. `
`When my eyes adjusted to the darkness, ......then even with the lack of light, I was vaguely able to make out these red footprints. `
`...They weren't actually glowing or anything, `
`...but they served perfectly well as a signpost leading me onwards. `
`*patter*patter*patter*patter*... `
`As though it was telling me to follow, `
`...the cat turned around and dashed off into the darkness. `
`......What is it? `
`...Something feels...very strange. `
`It's a feeling I haven't felt since I began calling myself the cruelest witch in the world. `
`...I can't quite remember what this feeling is. `
`Still, ...for one as tired of boredom as me, it's surely more fun this way. `
`I followed the bloody footprints of the cat, which would sometimes stop and look back at me, `
`...and walked on and on through the dark corridor... `
`Forward, ......turn, `
`...head down what appeared to be stairs from time to time. `
`And then, ...though I couldn't really tell because of the darkness, ...it went in through the crack of a door. `
`"......Here...?" `
`I pushed the door open slowly, ...but it was dark on the inside, just like the corridor. `
`However, the air and the slight change in the echos made by the footsteps... `
`told me that this was a room, not a corridor. `
`The sounds of the cat's footsteps were gone. `
`...However, the bloody footprints remained. `
`On the other side of some sort of wooden screen, ...under what looked like a small spotlight... `
`...There was that same black cat `
`gobbling down some bloodstained pet food. `
`...I see. `
`So, this is its reward for bringing me here... `
`"Cat... `
`Sorry to bother you during your meal, `
`...but I'd like you to summon your master. `
`......That is, unless you're actually the one who summoned me...?" `
`Talking to it didn't cause it to turn around. `
`...Well, I guess it is an animal eating its food. `
`...If I kick it away, it'll probably run off to its owner. `
`"......Hmph." `
`When I did kick the cat, `
`...it sailed away like a stuffed animal, `
`hit the wall, and fell to the ground. `
`Then, it vanished, melting into the darkness... `
`...What's with this cat? `
`...Is it just an illusion...? `
`".........!" `
`When I looked at its food plate, ...it was piled up with what appeared to be blood-drenched raw meat. `
`...It was as though someone had torn apart living flesh on the spot `
`and piled it up on there. `
`"...Come on, what's with the creepy reception?" `
`{a:c: `
`...That was a mean thing to do, kicking it.} `
`The instant I heard that voice, the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end. `
`Then, ...the surrounding area finally brightened... `
`However, Bernkastel had already guessed where this was before it grew bright... `
`"......That was you, was it not? `
`...That cat." `
`"............" `
`"...A cat who has learned how to eat meat...and that it can sometimes choose its own path. `
`...It has been a long time..." `
`"It's a path I might never have had to know about if you hadn't told me. `
`...You're the monster who taught me the taste of flesh. `
`...So, you've come back to life, `
`......Featherine Auaurora..." `
`"...Augustus Aurora... `
`You never learn, no matter how often I tell you that... `
`...Very well. `
`Even that brings back fond memories... `
`I have heard the rumors... `
`......It seems you have taken the name Bernkastel, Witch of Miracles, ...and have been playing a far from praiseworthy Fragment game..." `
`"I'm just imitating you. `
`Though I could hardly match up to your level. `
`...If the rumors you've heard about me are bad, that applies a hundredfold to you." `
`Bernkastel sat unreservedly in an antique chair, `
`...as though she was already familiar with the place. `
`"......What are you afraid of? `
`I am merely celebrating my reunion with my longest-serving miko so far... `
`Did you really find my messenger cat so displeasing?" `
`Bernkastel's manner seemed completely relaxed... `
`However, Featherine admonished her, telling her not to be afraid. `
`...And, judging by the expression that had risen to Bern's face, `
`...Featherine had been right on the mark... `
`"Did you really have to make such blunt insinuations against me? `
`...A cat leaving behind bloody footprints and stuffing its face with bloodstained meat..." `
`"............ `
`...Have no fear. `
`...Look closely. `
`...Do you see any cat stuffing its face with meat...? `
`I just gave it a plate of biscuits as a reward for going to get you..." `
`"............" `
`......It was as though soot covering the plate at her feet was blown away, even though there was no wind. `
`...There lay an adorable...and perfectly normal...cat dish, `
`...with a pile of small biscuits on top of it... `
`"......Tch..." `
`Bernkastel didn't even hide her displeased grimace. `
`Featherine shrugged and muttered "you haven't changed, child of man" as she rocked her rocking chair. `
`"......I see you're as unpleasant as ever. `
`...But I'm happy now. `
`Imitating you really has been far from boring." `
`"...Scold me as you please. `
`It is the parting gift I gave you when we last met." `
`"You liked rude mikos because they kept you entertained, right...? `
`Tch, ridiculous. `
`...If talking will only please you, I'll shut up. `
`...So, ...what do you want with me...?" `
`"It seems Beatrice's game has ended with Battler's victory. `
`...I observed it. `
`It was quite entertaining." `
`"...I'm sure you liked seeing me fail miserably." `
`"Nonsense, it was a splendid performance... `
`...I'm sure Beato is very grateful to you." `
`"......Hmph. `
`...And? `
`If you want me to read the Fragments of Beato's game aloud for you, I refuse. `
`I'm not your miko anymore." `
`"I have observed all of Beato's games. `
`...I also watched Lambdadelta's game and Battler's game with great interest. `
`...I believe I have formed an answer for all the riddles in my own way. `
`......The culprit. `
`The motive. `
`The individual tricks. `
`...I'm not yet clear about the very last part of the epitaph's riddle, `
`but I have enough of a theory that if I actually went to Rokkenjima and investigated, I should be able to resolve that part as well." `
`"......And...?" `
`"Of course, since there is no single truth, my theory is probably only one of many possibilities. `
`...However, that is only a question of possibilities, a trivial problem." `
`"...What are you up to? `
`......Do you want to debate Beato's game with me?" `
`"Wrong. `
`......What I want is to look at the answers, child of man." `
`Those words of Featherine's made Bernkastel straighten up. `
`...Her old master did not fail to notice that small reaction. `
`"So far, you have spiced up this tale as an actor. `
`In doing that, you have probably come to know many truths. `
`...However, even you are unaware of the truth behind several riddles that Beato has cleverly kept hidden, correct...?" `
`"...... `
`......I see... `
`...You want to use me to chew apart and string out the guts of something again." `
`"After watching a play, reading the pamphlet and learning what goes on behind the scenes is similar to, as you would say it, `
`enjoying some black tea after a meal. `
`...That enjoyment cannot be left undone." `
`"You like to play with them and love them while they're alive, then eat their flesh when they die. `
`...So, cats are doubly useful to you. `
`......Just die, monster." `
`"I want...to look at the answers. `
`......I'm sure you want to know them." `
`"............" `
`"Think of it as a burial for Beato's corpse, where you are in charge of the service. `
`...What do you say to that, child of man?" `
`"...Now, you're starting to speak my language." `
`When Featherine snapped her fingers, `
`a thin spotlight appeared on the table, which was covered with cluttered books. `
`There...lay a folded version of the game board for Beato's game. `
`The Witch of Theatergoing spun her finger in a circle, and the game board opened up by itself, `
`showing the black and white pieces lined up inside it. `
`"......The game board and all the pieces are gathered here. `
`...The records for the previous games are all present as well. `
`With a rustling sound, the book flipped through all its pages of its own accord, front to back, `
`shut itself, and flew to the side of the game board, where it waited. `
`Inside it, all of the movements of the pieces during previous games were recorded... `
`"......I see. `
`So you were short a player and a commentator..." `
`"We're also short on black tea. `
`...Similarly with dried plums. `
`Of course, I will find some." `
`"...... `
`...Okay. `
`If you add on some mustard rice cakes, then we have a deal." `
`"The negotiations are concluded." `
`"I have one condition." `
`"Oh, and what is that?" `
`"I'm going to be the Reader, okay...? `
`......I have no love, so a few things might be interpreted in an odd way. `
`...However, the Reader is free to read things in a manner and with an intonation of her choosing." `
`"I only want to check the answers. `
`...I don't particularly care about the tale itself. `
`...I'm not deeply interested in what sort of tale you'll create. `
`......Ah, yes. `
`Now I see what you're after." `
`"......Will you accept that condition?" `
`"Very well... `
`I want to know the answer. You have your grudge to worry about. `
`The negotiations are concluded." `
`When Featherine snapped her fingers once more, `
`...a large chair appeared, as though beckoning Bernkastel to sit there. `
`It was...a throne, horribly mismatched with the furnishings of this room. `
`Wait, I've seen this before. `
`......This is- `
`"I acknowledge it. You may sit. `
`You are the Game Master." `
`"......Are you sure? `
`...Are you really...sure...?" `
`"You can create whatever sort of tale you like to satisfy your grudge. `
`I am not interested. `
`However, I have one condition as well. `
`...Answer all of the questions I ask. `
`Absolutely no keeping secrets, hiding or dodging the issues." `
`"Heh, ...heheheheheheheheheh...! `
`Leave it to me. `
`Tearing up guts and dragging them out is my specialty. `
`...After all, you trained me." `
`"Let us make some black tea. `
`...We'll use our own hands, not magic. `
`...Let the master treat her miko to some tea..." `
`"The old Beato told me that witches are the best ones to have black tea with." `
`"It seems that rule doesn't apply to us... `
`...Heh, ...heheheheheheheheheheheheheheheh." `
`...At some point, ...that dish piled with biscuits... `
`had once again been covered with a mountain of torn-apart meat and a splatter of red. `
`No, not just meat, ...even the bowels... `
`"...Black tea is best enjoyed-" `
`""With your fellow monsters."" `
`"......In that case, let's get the pieces ready. `
`If we keep up the count, this'll be game 7, right?" `
`"Indeed. `
`A fortuitous number." `
`"But not for Beato, right?" `
`Bernkastel...slowly picked up a black piece. `
`It was...the piece that represented Beatrice. `
`It was sometimes a king, sometimes a queen, and could become a knight. `
`...However, that was only if it got promoted. `
`Until then, it was only a trash piece, like a pawn. `
`First comes the placing of the pieces. `
`By this point, the witch's game has already begun. `
`Bernkastel took Beato's piece...and raised it high. `
`"First move, placement. `
`Beatrice on d8." `
