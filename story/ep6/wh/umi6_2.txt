`At one time, only Beato and her fellow witches had gathered in this smoking room to chat. `
`Now, however, an unusually large number of people were present. `
`"Heheheheheh. `
`I wonder what kind of game Battler's gonna show us." `
`"...I don't care what it is, `
`as long as it's fun enough to relieve my boredom as I crush it." `
`"Leave everything to me, my master! `
`I will perform to my fullest and give you the results you desire!" `
`"Yeah, you'd better. `
`...I kept making strange faces all last game thanks to you... `
`. ...I hope I don't start getting wrinkles from all that." `
`"Th-There's no need to worry. `
`The beauty of my master's face is without peer, no matter how wrinkly it may get." `
`".........!!!" `
`"Heheheheh! `
`It's rare to see Bern in such high spirits. `
`Beato's game board really is something else." `
`"...How sad it is that the master of this game board is no longer with {f:5:us}." `
`"A tiger dies and leaves behind its hide. `
`Looks like Beato died and left behind her game." `
`"Even though chess still exists, no one knows the name of the person who invented it." `
`"Oh, you're right! `
`Kyahahaha, poor game inventors!" `
`"Come to think of it, Battler-san really has kept us waiting, hasn't he? `
`Is he still setting up the sixth game?" `
`"...Gertrude, `
`how have Lord {f:5:Battler}'s preparations {f:5:progressed}?" `
`"Please, allow me to speak. `
`...Know that he will be finished very soon." `
`"If he's kept us waiting this long, he must be pretty confident in his plan. `
`...He really humiliated me in front of my master last time. `
`I'll defeat him no matter what it takes...! `
`And you in particular! Make sure you don't screw up again...!" `
`"...I will meet the challenge with all of my strength." `
`The previous Game Master, Lambdadelta, `
`had confirmed that Battler understood everything about Beato's game. `
`However, in order to prove it, `
`Battler would have to run this game by himself and carry it through to completion. `
`In other words, if Erika could crush this game of Battler's, `
`she would, in effect, wipe away the dishonor of that last game. `
`Though Erika was chomping at the bit to get started, `
`it was taking Battler quite some time to show himself. `
`At that time, a swarm of gold butterflies popped into existence and took human form. `
`From the shape of that familiar dress, everyone immediately realized who it was. `
`"Ah, look, it's Beatrice-san. `
`And I thought you died and disappeared last time." `
`"...The one who died last time was Beatrice the player. `
`This is probably just a piece, ...Battler's piece." `
`"Even if she is a piece, it does not change the fact that it is {f:5:her}." `
`Beatrice gave an elegant curtsy as she appeared. `
`This humble entrance was so vastly different from her usual high-pitched laugh... `
`that it made the long-awaited start of the 6th game feel even more ominous than it otherwise would have... `
`"Father will be here very soon. `
`I ask that you wait for just a short while longer..." `
`"...... `
`...Aha. `
`Father? The heck? `
`Is that the new spin this time?" `
`Not only had Beato started talking in an unusually polite manner, `
`she had also used the word 'Father', ...presumably referring to Battler. `
`For an instant, everyone was stunned into silence, `
`but they quickly realized that this was setting up some kind of theme, and they grinned. `
`Beato wasn't the type who could keep up this kind of act for long. `
`It would probably fall apart in a few seconds, leaving her cackling rudely at everyone. `
`Erika, who was itching for a fight, went for Beato almost at once. `
`"I can't believe that incompetent Battler-san `
`reached the truth of your game." `
`"...I'm sure Father understands it quite deeply. `
`He really is good at that sort of thing." `
`"...... `
`Still, you're pretty lucky. `
`If Battler hadn't become the Game Master, you wouldn't have revived again. `
`You've really got the luck of the devil, don't you?" `
`"...The luck of the devil?" `
`"Well, either way, `
`I'm going to pay you back in full for last time. `
`You're just one of Battler's delusions, so I'll erase every part of you and knock you down into the abyss of oblivion." `
`"I too cannot allow you such an easy victory. `
`. ...{ruby:watashi:I}, uh, look forward to having a good, clean fight." `
`"......???" `
`By this point, everyone realized that something weird was going on. `
`There was no doubt that the face, the dress, and the hair were all Beatrice's. `
`...However, ...her expression was different. `
`Even though she had Beato's face, Beato would never show anyone an expression like that. `
`"........." `
`"...Who...are you?" `
`There was a heavy silence. `
`...Lambdadelta spoke for everyone there. `
`At first, Beato had worn a smiling yet blank expression. `
`...However, when she realized that the mood had gone suddenly stiff, her expression finally darkened, and she hung her head. `
`"Who...are you?" `
`"...You appear to be Lady Beatrice, `
`...but are you {f:5:not}...?" `
`Even Dlanor was forced to ask, despite the rudeness of the question. `
`That was how much... `
`this woman... `
`who appeared to be Beato... `
`was not. `
`"...Am I somehow different... `
`...from the Beatrice everyone was expecting?" `
`"...What are you talking about?" `
`"Wait a second, `
`don't tell me you have amnesia or something..." `
`"I-I was only born recently, so I have no memories at all. `
`...H-However, `
`I will study hard...in order to become the Beatrice you all expect-" `
`{a:c: `
`"Beato, `
`...I thought I told you to stay in your room."} `
`Battler's voice came out of nowhere. `
`...His tone was very slightly cold. `
`Beato's expression looked like that of a young girl being scolded. `
`With a swirl of gold butterflies, `
`...Battler appeared. `
`His dignified bearing and appearance were fitting for the ruler of this game. `
`...However, his expression was gloomy, `
`and his gaze was directed at Beato. `
`"...Go back to your room. `
`You aren't supposed to be here." `
`"I-I just wanted to help you however I could, Father..." `
`"Go. To your room." `
`He spoke both softly and forcefully. `
`Battler didn't leave her any room for debate. `
`Beato hung her head and curtsied as she prepared to leave the room... `
`"Also." `
`"Y-Yes, what is it, Father?" `
`"...My name is Battler. `
`...Never call me by a different name again." `
`"...Y- `
`Yes." `
`Beato melted into a cloud of gold butterflies and disappeared. `
`This was the first part of the tale with Battler as the Game Master. `
`The witches had all assumed that he'd come forward with some flashy, big developments, ...so this was all completely unexpected to them. `
`...Their mouths were still hanging open. `
`"...This is a pretty weird take on it." `
`"Pardon me. `
`...Please forget what you saw just now." `
`"Hmph, you're playing dumb, but this is all just part of your plan, isn't it? `
`You're scheming to give us the wrong impression, like another North Wind and the Sun strategy, aren't you?" `
`"...Is there something {f:5:wrong}?" `
`"Don't worry about it. `
`It has nothing to do with you people." `
`"I see. `
`Guess it doesn't matter then. `
`Okay, Battler! Start up the new game right away! `
`You've kept us waiting so long, it's gotten totally boring!" `
`"...Sure. `
`Let's start the 6th game. `
`...Erika, and you too, Bernkastel. `
`This will be my tale, proof that I've reached Beatrice's truth. `
`...Lambdadelta, `
`please watch this game until the end, as a former Game Master." `
`"Sure, looking forward to it. What's the title?" `
`"...<Dawn>. `
`...As in, the Dawn of the Golden Witch." `
`"Sure, if we're talking about a winter sun that goes below the horizon right away." `
`"Of course, my master. `
`I'll drag it back down for you. `
`At least your naming sense is <good>, Battler-san. I'll give you that much." `
`"I'm glad you like it. `
`...Then let's get started. `
`The 6th game will now begin." `
`Battler solemnly announced the start of the game. `
`...Compared to his fired-up attitude at the end of the previous game, where he and Erika had sworn to settle everything next time, `
`he was extremely quiet now... `
`"...Ange, `
`Beato seems to have changed a lot since we last saw her." `
`"I'm surprised too. `
`...I don't have a clue what's going on. `
`I don't even get why Beato's alive in the first place. `
`I just finished reading it a second ago, ...but at the end of the previous tale, `
`didn't she die just before Battler reached the truth?" `
`"There are two kinds of death in this world. `
`...One of them is when a piece is taken from the game board. `
`Such a death exists only within the bounds of the game, and these lives can revive over and over again each time a new game begins." `
`"...That's why the witches are so merciless when it comes to taking those lives..." `
`To the witch players, `
`the lives of those characters who appear on the game board are no different from pieces on a chessboard that take other pieces and get taken. `
`After all, these pieces will be set up again when the next game starts. `
`"Maria's Sakutarou is a prime example of these." `
`"Sakutarou...is Onee-chan's piece...?" `
`Yes, ...that makes sense. `
`In the game board that represents the inside of Onee-chan's head, Sakutarou certainly does exist... `
`and is a piece that always stays by her side. `
`Though he's nothing more than a stuffed animal in the real world, `
`on Onee-chan's game board, he's no less of a piece than any other. `
`"But...I wonder. `
`...If he were a piece in a witch's game, it should be possible to revive him easily, right? `
`...But Onee-chan wasn't able to revive Sakutarou in her world." `
`"...That's because she lost that completely unique stuffed animal that was his vessel. `
`Because of this, the conditions for that piece's existence were violated, and it became impossible to revive him on Maria's game board. `
`...The only reason you were able to revive Sakutarou on the game board was because you once again satisfied the conditions for his existence, correct?" `
`"......True." `
`Maria onee-chan `
`was only unable to revive him because she had lost the stuffed animal that was his vessel. `
`...If, like the rest of my family on Beato's game board, `
`she hadn't needed a 'vessel' for him, she would've been able to revive him as often as she wanted. `
`"I get it. `
`...It makes sense that Sakutarou was Onee-chan's piece. `
`At least, as long as his vessel was okay, he could've been revived over and over again." `
`"Correct. `
`As long as his vessel is safe, he can be revived over and over again. `
`That's what the life of a piece is like..." `
`"...That's the first kind of death in this world. `
`...What's the second?" `
`"That's the death of beings outside the game board. `
`To continue with the Sakutarou example, this would be like Maria's death." `
`"You mean...not her death as a piece, `
`...but the death of the real Onee-chan, right?" `
`"Not necessarily. `
`Loss of interest or concern would have the same effect. `
`...When Maria outgrows playing with stuffed animals, 'Maria the game player' will die. `
`It's as quick and easy as turning off the switch on a TV when you get bored of it." `
`"...I see. `
`In that case, 'Beato the player' completely gave up on winning during the last game, `
`...so she died and vanished. `
`...Which means...if Beato ever comes back, thinking she's got a chance of defeating Onii-chan, that'll mean she's come back to life, right?" `
`"Logically, that is true. `
`It's the same for humans, witches, and even gods. `
`If they lose interest and concern, they can die at any time. `
`And if they regain that interest, they can revive at any time. `
`...However, though the concept of time does not exist in the world of gods, and they can revive whenever they want, `
`time shoots by like an arrow in the human world, and it isn't so easy there..." `
`"That's true. `
`Skipping school for one day might not be a problem, but if you skipped for three days in a row, it'd be really hard to convince yourself to go back." `
`"And what if that stretched out for a month, a year, a decade? `
`Or a thousand years, like in the world of witches?" `
`"...I see. `
`If you skipped class for that long, it'd mean your 'death' socially. `
`...After being dead that long, `
`not only would you be unable to catch up on all you missed in the world at large, you'd also lose any motivation you might've had when you left. `
`...So, even though you'd be alive, it'd be fair to say that you'd died once. `
`You would never again...be able to regain the self that you once were. It would never come back to life." `
`"Beato lost any chance or hope of winning. `
`...Even though she knew this, she pretended not to and kept on fighting for many, many games. `
`So, Beato will not return. `
`Her hopes were crushed. `
`She's spent all of the willpower that she might have used to regain the will to fight. `
`Therefore, `
`... `
`{p:1:that Beatrice will never revive again}." `
`That Beato, who just sat around the whole time with empty eyes in the 5th game, `
`...must've been her corpse. `
`She managed to remain on the game board despite it all, `
`...but then even that corpse was wiped away... `
`If Beato had been the Game Master at that time instead of Lambdadelta, `
`the game board itself would have vanished at that moment, and everything would've ended. `
`Come to think of it, Beato started to lose the will to fight back near the end of the 4th game. `
`When Beato loses her will to fight, ...the world of this game disappears. `
`However, the witches wanted to keep playing in this game board world, `
`so Lambdadelta bound Beato in place with that cursed shackle. `
`She used that shackle to fix the game board in place and prevent it from disappearing, `
`even if Beato did lose the will to fight. `
`In chess, this would be the equivalent of removing the set time limit for each turn, `
`making it endless. `
`However, simply having the game endlessly paused on Beato's turn would cause the witches to die from their illness of boredom. `
`That's why Lambdadelta took the position of Game Master. `
`...Starting then, Beato's existence was no longer one of the conditions necessary for the game's existence. `
`That's probably why the shackles binding her to the game board were released. `
`And that explains why she disappeared in the 5th game... `
`"...So, `
`when Onii-chan managed to reach the truth, `
`...it was one game too late for him to tell Beato about it." `
`"The 5th game was a form of charity on Lambdadelta's part. `
`...She merely showed Battler some mercy as the Witch of Certainty, acknowledging his strong desire to reach the truth no matter what..." `
`"...How can you call that charity? `
`It's just those fickle witches killing time. `
`...Let's get back to the point. `
`So, that means this weird Beato isn't the player Beato. `
`She's just a piece Beato." `
`"True. `
`...If that is the case, she should eventually become the Beato everyone knows. `
`...I imagine that is the Beato that Battler wants..." `
`"...... `
`...You mean, `
`...he wasn't satisfied with just a doll?" `
`When playing with dolls, `
`one can project the personality they most desire onto the doll. `
`...However, since you are acting out their part, nothing unexpected can ever happen. `
`You cannot hope for any unanticipated happiness. `
`In the human world, there is nothing so boring as a pre-established harmony. `
`That's why, though a doll can become a person's best friend in the world, `
`...people eventually get bored and outgrow them... `
`Onii-chan only wants the real Beato. `
`He couldn't bear having a doll that only acted like Beato... `
`"...A Beato born as Battler's piece `
`would probably move according to Battler's wishes." `
`"That's only natural for a piece. `
`Pieces move however their players tell them to. `
`...And they can't do anything else. `
`...I see what it is Onii-chan wants. `
`So what's up with this weird Beato?" `
`"...Battler might be trying to revive Beato in the truest sense. `
`...That is the never-dying dream held by children of man." `
`"You just used the red to say that wasn't possible." `
`"...'That Beato' will never revive. `
`However, that doesn't mean that it is impossible for 'Beato' to be born again... `
`Have you forgotten? `
`I believe that Bernkastel herself revealed Beato's true form at the end of the 1st game..." `
`"...... `
`...Now I remember. `
`...She said something about how Beato exists as the incarnation of a rule." `
`"Information began to be accumulated based around that rule, `
`and in the end, it took the form of the witch known as Beatrice. `
`If that pattern is followed once more, the same Beatrice will be born again, `
`and perhaps one could call that a resurrection..." `
`"......In other words, that weird Beato... `
`...is Beato as an egg...or maybe a chick." `
`"That interpretation is probably accurate... `
`...In short, this Beato is a chick who might grow to become that Beato." `
`"And that means... `
`...this pure and lovable kid will eventually grow into that screwed up, crazy witch." `
`In other words, that Beato is a baby version of the Beato we all know. `
`So, just like how no person is born evil, `
`...the newborn Beato isn't evil either. `
`Even though she really is a different person, ...if you measure her by her root...or perhaps her soul, `
`...then maybe you really could call this a resurrection. `
`...However, ...this reality can't possibly be easy to accept. `
`Though she may technically be Beato herself, `
`...she is also, without a doubt, a different person. `
`And that way she acts...would make anyone feel as though something's out of place... `
`"How entertaining... `
`...Hearing you read aloud is far from boring." `
`"...I doubt you even really need someone to read aloud for you. `
`...It looks like you already know everything." `
`"I only reached that thought because I am engaged in a conversation with you. `
`...My thoughts are more numerous than the stars in the sky. `
`I only appear to know everything to a child of man like you. `
`...However, without you here, I am nothing but a weak, sickly person without even the power to think..." `
`"If you'd just said that in the first place, I would've agreed to read for you a lot more easily." `
`"...My mood just happened to improve. `
`...Don't get an over-swelled impression of yourself. `
`Your life means less to me than a leaf one has lost after using it as a bookmark..." `
`"'Please keep reading already'. `
`Is that pretty much what you're trying to say? `
`Ok..." `
`"Heh... `
`Far from boring. `
`...You really do make an excellent miko." `
`Featherine rocked back in her rocking chair and looked up at the ceiling, `
`laughing as though the conversation itself was pleasant for her. `
`Ange was slowly figuring out how to deal with this strange witch. `
`...This person was also...bored. `
`It's not uncommon for a sick person, who's bored from being bedridden for a long time, to start acting rebellious. `
`On the other hand, they can also get a little bored of being treated kindly all the time. `
`She may want to be shown respect for her superiority, `
`but it's probably more interesting for her when she's spoken to rudely. `
`...What a coincidence. `
`That's exactly how I used to be. `
`"Anyway, `
`...from what we learned in the 4th game, there's no doubt that there's been some kind of antagonism between Beato and Onii-chan in the past. `
`Learning about this Beato might give us a key to finding the truth." `
`"It does seem so. `
`...It has caught my interest as well. `
`...Let's read her tale too." `
`"Oh, sure, as you wish, my master." `
`When Ange raised her hands like a conductor, the bookshelves in this bizarre study responded. `
`...Once again, several books floated out and began to swirl around Ange... `
`Kinzo's study is the room belonging to the master in the Human world. `
`So, this study in the world of nonhumans belonged to the master of the game board... `
`...and was a place where he could look down upon the Humans... `
`Therefore, one could hardly be blamed for mistaking the imposing, berobed man in the center of the study for Kinzo, `
`if only for a second. `
`But it wasn't Kinzo. `
`...This was Battler, the one who had taken up the position of Game Master, `
`becoming the new territory lord of this world. `
`"........." `
`Around Battler was a swirl of glowing Fragments, sparkling like the night sky, `
`...and on the floor was what appeared to be a red magic circle. `
`To an outsider, it would seem to be nothing more than a incomprehensible geometric shape. `
`But to Battler, who stood at its center, `
`it was the outline for a new tale... `
`A new line grew across the magic circle, following Battler's gaze. `
`Then, at the instant it connected with a complicated symbol, the entire magic circle flashed brightly. `
`"...So, `
`...how does it look?" `
`"It is splendid, Master. `
`...The 6th game is complete." `
`As Battler wiped his forehead and finally relaxed, `
`Genji, who was standing behind him and watching over his every move, nodded deeply in response. `
`"...I always thought being a Game Master meant you could make the tale however you want, `
`...but this is seriously harder than I thought." `
`"You must write up multiple tales and make the inner and outer sides of the story match. `
`...Though truly, you have displayed such skill. It is hard to believe that this is your first time. `
`...I believe even Erika-sama will be satisfied with this game." `
`"Well, hopefully it matches that great detective's tastes. `
`...Still, ...I've gotta honestly respect Beato now. `
`...I can hardly believe that she managed to make tales that complicated and do it so easily." `
`"...Easily? Far from it. `
`...Beatrice-sama also worried and worried, racking her brain over various contradictions each time she created a tale. `
`She was constantly battling with logic errors." `
`"Logic errors?" `
`"That is when the two sides of the tale do not meet, creating a contradiction. `
`...When this happens, it becomes a fatal violation of the rules known as a logic error, and the game board will immediately collapse and be destroyed. `
`It is the greatest and worst form of error that the witch side can make, and one which must always be avoided." `
`"So, Beato `
`got close to bumping into those many times in her games...?" `
`"...She fought with them every time she created a game. `
`...I believe it grew even more difficult for her as you became a more formidable opponent." `
`"......So, `
`...do you think this game I've made... `
`is good enough to show Beato?" `
`"...Yes. `
`...Of course." `
`"...... `
`...Beato `
`hasn't woken up yet, has she?" `
`"........." `
`"It's been a while since her body was formed as a personification of the rules. `
`Is she still not awake...?" `
`After remaining silent for a while longer, Genji answered. `
`"...She woke up three days ago. `
`You were concentrating on the construction of the 6th game, so I decided to wait before telling you... `
`My sincere apologies..." `
`"Oh, really? `
`Yeah, I'll bet she's still all drowsy after sleeping so long. `
`I've really wanted to show her my game! `
`No, it's more than that. I have to show her. `
`I need to tell her that I've understood everything." `
`Battler's face broke into a smile. `
`There was no trace in his expression of the hatred he had once felt towards Beato for murdering his family... `
`"...In a way, `
`...that was the final riddle of the 5th game." `
`"Yes. `
`...When Battler reached the truth, there was a great change in his impression of Beato." `
`"So, should we assume that there really was something between Onii-chan and Beato... `
`and that he forgot all about it...?" `
`However, Battler suspected this in the 4th game and asked Beato about it. `
`According to the tale, `
`this was denied by the red truth: `
`'Six years ago, no person called Beatrice existed for Battler'... `
`"...We can read this as saying that Beato did not exist six years ago, `
`or it could simply mean that she had no connection to Battler at that time. `
`However, either way, Battler did not visit Rokkenjima at all for the next six years..." `
`"October 4th, 1986 should have been the first time Beatrice and Onii-chan met. `
`...If so, why was there already some kind of antagonism between them? `
`I don't have a clue what it means." `
`"...That 'sin of Ushiromiya Battler's', which Beato took Battler to task for in the 4th game, `
`might give us a clue. `
`...The result of that might have been Beatrice herself." `
`"The result? `
`The result of Onii-chan's sin was...Beato...?" `
`That almost sounds as though Onii-chan `
`created the witch called Beatrice himself... `
`"Almost as though... `
`Beatrice was Battler's piece." `
`"...Huh...?" `
`"Battler sinned six years ago. `
`Because of that sin, people died. `
`The one doing the killing was Beatrice. `
`...If you consider the possibility that everything is connected to Battler's sin six years ago, `
`...then the one who created Beatrice was Battler himself. `
`I thought it sounded almost as though she was Battler's piece..." `
`"I don't get it. `
`Even if Onii-chan sinned in some way, his crime couldn't have been anything close to murder. `
`If this huge massacre is in retaliation for what he did, `
`then it's totally out of proportion." `
`"Beato killed our family. `
`Dad, Mom, Onii-chan, everyone. `
`...I can't believe that Onii-chan's sin was anything deserving of that." `
`"The weight of a sin depends on the person measuring it. `
`Even a sin so light that Battler might have forgotten... `
`could have been so serious to Beato that she hated him enough to massacre his whole family a full six years after the fact. `
`...Well, even I find that a bit excessive, and more importantly, `
`if she were a person like that, I would find it hard to accept that Battler would act so friendly towards her after discovering the truth..." `
`"........." `
`Featherine's observation was an interesting one. `
`In a past game, `
`Beato clearly said that Onii-chan's sin six years ago was the cause of this two-day tragedy. `
`I still don't know what kind of sin that was. `
`However, he figured out what it was at the end of the 5th game, `
`...and he even apologized to Beato. `
`Even though she was the witch who had massacred his entire family in retaliation for his sin of six years previous, `
`...Battler apologized to her. `
`...Of course, it was the player Battler who apologized, `
`not the piece Battler whose family had been murdered over and over again. `
`But even so, ...Battler must have remembered something at the end of the last game `
`that made him feel like apologizing... `
`"...Does that mean this sin from six years ago... `
`is hidden somewhere in the tales we've seen so far...?" `
`"...I have already formed a certain theory on that matter." `
`"Oh? `
`Let's hear it." `
`"Heheheheheh, I cannot tell you yet. `
`I want to enjoy being the only one who knows the answer for a little while longer..." `
`"...Well then, I guess I'm done reading for you." `
`"Hahaha, well, we can't have that, can we? `
`...Have some patience and read a bit further. `
`My theory is still nothing more than a guess. `
`...Once I'm certain of it, I'll tell you." `
`"Okay, okay, my master. `
`I actually do want to hear what comes next, after all." `
`Just what kind of connection `
`do Onii-chan and Beatrice have with each other? `
`...Understanding that will probably give me a massive clue towards finding the truth of this world. `
`After all, because he remembered that, `
`he was able to reach the truth. `
`"Beatrice...!!" `
`"Welcome, Master... `
`Beatrice-sama is waiting for you. `
`This way, please..." `
`This place was a villa set aside for Beatrice's use. `
`It was a sacred site for her only, built so that she could spend her days without being affected by the outside world. `
`My heart began to race. `
`...I'm so glad that she was able to revive...and that everything's okay... `
`Beato is a personification of the rules. `
`So, even though she was destroyed once, it's possible for her to be reborn again... `
`Battler had quickly succeeded in reviving Beato's body, but he'd had trouble summoning her soul back. `
`However, during the time he'd spent immersed in the creation of the 6th game, she had woken up. `
`And this had happened three days ago. `
`Battler let himself be led into the dining hall. `
`The dining hall had been set up for his and Beato's use. `
`...It existed so that they could enjoy some black tea while having conversations that were only possible now that he had reached all of the truth. `
`I want to tell her. `
`I want to tell Beato that I've found the truth. `
`Battler couldn't hold back his excitement over this miracle he'd been granted, the miracle of Beato waiting for him in the dining hall to hear what he had to say... `
`"How is Beatrice? `
`Same as usual? `
`Is she doing well?" `
`"Oh yes, she is doing quite well. `
`She has been waiting for you all this time, Master. Oh yes." `
`"So she's in the dining hall. Is she eating or something? `
`Ah, that's okay, it doesn't matter either way...!" `
`"Hohoho, you'll be surprised..." `
`"Beatrice...!!" `
`When he swung open the doors to the dining hall, `
`...Battler was greeted by a wonderful sight. `
`Though the food laid out on the table wasn't particularly sensational, `
`it was arranged beautifully, and a champagne bottle stood there waiting. `
`...Then, ...the person clad in that familiar dress with the beautiful golden hair bowed deeply in greeting. `
`"...B-Beatrice..." `
`"You have my sincerest gratitude for giving me this form." `
`"Ha, ...hahahaha... `
`Come on, don't worry about that... `
`...I'm so glad, `
`Beato......" `
`Battler rushed up to Beato and hugged her tightly. `
`...Just to make sure her body wasn't just mist or an illusion. `
`"...I... `
`...solved... `
`your riddle for you... `
`But then, `
`before I could tell you about it, `
`you went and disappeared..." `
`"...I am right here... `
`I will not disappear..." `
`"It's okay, you can stop talking like that. `
`I'm not going to ask you for anything in return. `
`...Anyway, I want to apologize. `
`And I want to talk with you. `
`...I don't even know where I should start." `
`"You have done nothing that you need to apologize for, Father. `
`...I'm glad just to be of service to you." `
`"......Beato...?" `
`"Beatrice was born for your sake, Father. `
`Please, let me support you. `
`And Father, `
`congratulations on completing the 6th game." `
`"I told you, stop talking like that. `
`You're creeping me out." `
`"...Do you find this style of speech displeasing? `
`Please forgive my rudeness..." `
`"Well, I don't 'find it displeasing', but it's not like you. `
`I guess I like the way you usually talk best." `
`"............" `
`Beato smiled vaguely. `
`To Battler, it probably looked as though they were both smiling at the unusual way she was talking. `
`...However, Beato's smile literally was vague and uncertain. `
`After all, ...she didn't know how she was supposed to talk... `
`"Anyway, Beato, `
`just what kind of joke is this? `
`Don't tell me that the great Beatrice-sama decided to cook for me...?" `
`"When I heard that you had completed the 6th game, `
`I wanted to see if I could prepare a modest reward to congratulate you..." `
`"...Hohoho. `
`Beatrice-sama really worked hard to make this. `
`I didn't even need to lend a hand at all, no I didn't!" `
`The food set on the table really was modest and inexpertly made. `
`You could tell by looking at it that Beato, who wasn't particularly skilled with cooking, had given it her all... `
`However, signs of discomfort and irritation were beginning to appear on Battler's face... `
`"...What's... `
`...going on here...?" `
`"Well, as she said, Beatrice-sama wishes to congratulate you..." `
`Sweat was starting to show up on Kumasawa's forehead... `
`...She was also feeling uneasy. `
`When he noticed, Battler realized that it wasn't just his imagination. `
`Beato turned her back to Battler and stuck a corkscrew into the champagne bottle. `
`Then, she showed it to Battler. `
`"Father, congratulations on the completion of the 6th game. `
`In the hopes that you will prove victorious over your longtime rival, Furudo Erika..." `
`*pop* `
`When presented with a champagne bottle and a sound like that, anyone would think that the cork had been pulled out. `
`However, it wasn't the cork... `
`It was the bottom of the bottle. The high-quality champagne that Beato had procured splashed out all over the floor and her dress. `
`Then, the same sound repeated several more times. `
`...Each time, one of the plates of food on the table was knocked into the air. `
`"...F- `
`Father, `
`...did you find the food displeasing...?" `
`"Who...are you...?" `
`"...I-I am Beatrice. `
`...I was born for your sake, Father..." `
`"That's not right..." `
`"Huh...?" `
`"Who is this?! `
`This isn't Beato...!! `
`And anyway, don't call me Father...!! `
`What's going on here?! `
`What is this?! `
`Didn't I revive Beato?! `
`Genji, what's this all about?!!" `
`"...My apologies, `
`but that is indeed Beatrice-sama." `
`"Are you kidding me?! `
`How is this supposed to be Beato?! `
`She's totally wrong, a fake!!" `
`"No, this is Beatrice-sama. `
`This is, without a doubt, Beatrice-sama, who was born in accordance with the rules of the game board." `
`"No, this isn't anything like Beato...!! `
`Beato would always talk in that weird way, and laugh rudely, and...and...!!" `
`"No, this is most certainly Beatrice-sama herself." `
`"Then why is she talking like that? `
`Why is she calling me Father?!" `
`"B-Beatrice-sama was only born a short while ago... `
`It would be far too cruel to expect her to act as she once did so soon..." `
`"Are you saying that her memory hasn't returned yet?" `
`"...Master, `
`this person truly is Beatrice-sama herself. `
`However, she is not the Beatrice-sama you know so well." `
`"What are you talking about...?! `
`I'm the Game Master, right?! `
`Why can't I revive Beato...?!" `
`"Beatrice-sama has revived. `
`However, the old Beatrice-sama lived for a thousand years. `
`...This Beatrice-sama, on the other hand, was only born a short while ago...! `
`If she appears to be a different person, well, that just can't be helped...!" `
`"Then, ...how can I revive that Beato?! `
`Her body is right here! `
`How can I revive her soul?!" `
`"...If she lives the same thousand-year life again, she should become the same Beatrice-sama she was before." `
`"Are you telling me to wait a thousand years...?!" `
`"A-A person's personality isn't decided solely by their birth. `
`It can change drastically based on how they live and what they experience..." `
`"...Do you understand? `
`Even though she is the same Beato, she is not the same." `
`"I get it. `
`...Even if you had two of the exact same person, they could change enormously depending on their upbringing." `
`"Even though they might both be the same human to start with, their upbringing could change them so much that they effectively become two completely different people. `
`...Usually, we use the term 'person' to refer to a person, not their personality. `
`However, since Humans recognize a person by their personality, those two might as well be different people, from a Human perspective..." `
`"...That's so true. `
`If that tragedy 12 years ago hadn't happened, this little lady of ours might be a cute girl who could smile without looking weird." `
`"That's rude. `
`I'm plenty cute as it is." `
`...I understand. `
`If a personality is what makes a person a person in our eyes... `
`You could probably say that a second personality represents a different person entirely, even if it inhabits the same flesh body. `
`At the very least... `
`I'm a completely different person than I used to be 12 years ago. `
`And if my family had come home 12 years ago, `
`...then the Ange that resulted would surely be a completely different person from me. `
`Even a single human can become a different person. `
`In fact, depending on their upbringing and endless possibilities, they can become an endless number of different people. `
`...So, just because this is Beato, `
`...that's no guarantee that she'll become the Beato that Onii-chan knows so well. `
`"And on top of that, Beatrice is a witch who lived a thousand years. `
`...People can die and be reborn in just three days. `
`A thousand years...is such a huge amount of time." `
`"......It seems you're quite a skilled reader. `
`...For most of my readers, it would be necessary to spend several hundred pages to explain `
`how a single person can become different people depending on their upbringing and time." `
`"Don't underestimate your readers. `
`We aren't just reading. `
`We read, ...and we think." `
`"...If I make a hundred people read it, about 90 will be able to. `
`However, only 50 will actually understand what it means. `
`And not even 20 will actually think beyond that. `
`...And all I ask is that they think it over a bit. `
`...Nothing more than that. *giggle*" `
`"However, it seems that 'you' are one of those precious 20 readers... `
`That's why I invited you here, child of man..." `
`It was seriously hard to like this Hachijo Tohya person. `
`...However, though this forgery she had written was still in its first stages, `
`...it definitely felt as though it contained something very similar to the tales in those message bottles. `
`Speaking metaphorically, ...one might call it a scent. `
`An indescribably unique and stern atmosphere, ...like a stuffy library. `
`The 'Beatrice' who wrote the message bottles and Hachijo Tohya are different people. `
`...And yet, this has the same scent as that tale... `
`...I see. `
`This is why some of those curious Witch Hunters are so intensely devoted to her... `
`Their keen sense of smell was able to sniff out that familiar scent... `
`"Very well then. `
`...Please continue reading. `
`There could be nothing more entertaining than watching your face as you glance over the words. `
`That, and speaking with you..." `
`"I guess it's true that writers are always starving for opinions on their works. `
`...However, sorry to disappoint you. I don't have time to read all the way through this thick manuscript. `
`More importantly, ......" `
`"...And yet, you have plenty of time..." `
`Both the second hand and the pendulum on the ornate clock behind Hachijo had been moving the whole time. `
`However, ...absolutely no time had passed for a while now. `
`Only about three minutes had gone by since the time she had entered the room... `
`"See? `
`Time isn't one of your problems. `
`...No sort of time will chase you away until you've finished reading..." `
`"........." `
`"Next page, Lady, next page." `
`Amakusa badgered me to turn the page, ...so I returned to the world of the tale once more. `
`...Why does her tale have the same scent as Beatrice's, I wonder... `
`Is it because...she actually has reached the truth, as she claims? `
`Does this mean that anyone who knows the truth could create an endless number of message bottles? `
`...Is that how the cat box world works...? `
`I see. `
`...I guess she might also be an Endless Witch. `
`In fact, `
`...maybe anyone who knows the truth can become an Endless Witch. `
`An endless tale, created by the Endless Witches. `
`The two days starting on October 4th, 1986, where my family is being toyed with endlessly. `
`...I have to end it. `
`I have to find a hint of the truth from within this story...and end this endless tale. `
`"What do you think, Beato? `
`How's this 6th game I've made?" `
`"............" `
`"Well, you're not the type to give me an honest compliment anyway... `
`You'd probably say something more like 'not bad for an incompetent fool like you'." `
`"*cackle*cackle* `
`Not bad for an incompetent fool like you." `
`"Heh. `
`Now that I've seen what it's like to be a Game Master, it's pretty clear. `
`...I wasn't the only one who had it rough each and every game." `
`"........." `
`"'Creating a game is far from easy. `
`I certainly never expected us to recognize each others' efforts like this.'" `
`"Creating a game is far from easy. `
`I certainly never expected us to recognize each others' efforts like this." `
`"........." `
`"........." `
`"...All wrong... `
`...This...isn't Beato..." `
`Battler slammed hard on the desk, but the piece Beato showed no reaction. `
`...After all, Battler hadn't ordered her to react. `
`It would be easy to revive that Beato as a piece. `
`However, it would only move according to Battler's wishes. `
`...Having a conversation with it... `
`...was no different `
`from talking to himself... `
`The Game Master could summon any kind of piece. `
`He could move those pieces in any way he wanted, reigning as an absolute god. `
`...However, for that very reason, `
`...they were just pieces. `
`That made it unbelievably lonely... `
`...and sad. `
`"...You created many kinds of furniture, as well as several tales in the past. `
`...When I saw that, ...I was sure you were having a great time doing it." `
`"'But that's all wrong.'" `
`"You were...unbelievably lonely." `
`"'It must've been such a relief for you, having an opponent like me who could actually go against you. `
`Yep, I'm painfully aware of that now.'" `
`"......That weird, polite Beato... `
`really was you, wasn't she? `
`...The way you were a thousand years ago." `
`"'And yet, `
`...she's a different person.'" `
`"The way she looks just like you is what I really can't get over...! `
`I can't stand it..." `
`"'However, she isn't a piece, so she can go against my will.'" `
`"That Beato is much more alive than a piece like you. `
`I get that! `
`But it's all wrong!! `
`That isn't you! `
`She's a completely separate person, like a long-lost little sister or something! `
`And that's why... `
`...I just can't accept her...!!" `
`...As much as he hated the piece version of Beato... `
`Battler felt an even stronger dislike... `
`...for the 'chick' Beato. `
`Even after a whole thousand years... `
`She still wouldn't become the original Beato. `
`Even if she were ordered to act like the original Beato, ...it would just be an imitation. `
`This was a very similar but separate person, and definitely not Beato herself. `
`...So, ......in the previous game, `
`...Beato really did disappear for all eternity... `
`Even after becoming the Game Master, `
`...there was no way to revive her... `
`"...Laugh. `
`Laugh at how pathetic I am." `
`"...... `
`...Heheheheh, `
`*cackle*cackle* `
`Pfft, `
`hya `
`hah `
`hahahahahhahahaaaaah!!" `
`Just give it a rest already... `
`You're just an illusion who won't laugh unless I order it... `
`...and who can't even continue to laugh unless I keep on ordering it... `
`...Just disappear!! `
