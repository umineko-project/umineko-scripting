`...On Rokkenjima, this day `
`--or rather, this round-- `
`was the same as any other. `
`The typhoon would be coming very soon. `
`The sky was still overcast, but the clouds were moving quickly. `
`The only thing on Natsuhi's mind was the plan to cover up Kinzo's absence again this year. `
`Krauss appeared to have suffered a stomachache from the stress and was sleeping in his room. `
`Jessica and Kumasawa had left in a boat to go shopping and greet the incoming relatives on Niijima. `
`The servants had been busy since the early morning preparing for the family conference, the greatest event of the year... `
`Shannon and Kanon were rushing to get the guesthouse ready. `
`"...If the relatives are going to stay the night, shouldn't the guest rooms in the mansion be more than enough?" `
`"Good point. `
`It's a pain to clean up this place too, after all. `
`...Even so, I like cleaning the guesthouse." `
`"Yeah, it's nice and quiet without Madam and all the annoying servants." `
`Shannon smiled wryly as she performed a detailed examination of the guest room. `
`Did we forget to clean anything? Do we need to restock anything? `
`She diligently gave the room one final check over... `
`"You checked everything thoroughly last night too, didn't you? `
`You really are dedicated." `
`"It's days like this that you tend to get pranked if you're careless. `
`...You can never find important things when you need them, `
`and things that were supposed to be closed turn out to be open." `
`"That's because you're too careless. `
`You don't pay attention while you work." `
`"I guess that's why you're helping me check. `
`Thanks." `
`"...There's nothing to thank me for. `
`If you were a bit more alert, I wouldn't have to help at all." `
`"......*giggle* `
`But you actually just want to be with me, right? `
`You're such a kid." `
`"Th-That's not it at all... `
`It's all because you've been so ecstatic about George-sama lately. `
`You're messing up so much, I can't let you out of my sight." `
`"*giggle*... `
`...Kanon-kun, `
`let's chat a bit." `
`"...We can't do that now. We're working." `
`"You keep making fun of me and George-sama, `
`...but how is it going between you and Jessica-sama?" `
`"N-Nothing's going on in particular... `
`If you have time to talk about that, let's just finish this... `
`...wah-" `
`Kanon had--very obviously--been trying to change the subject. `
`Shannon had then snuck up behind him and pushed him down onto the bed. `
`"So, why did you turn down Milady when she asked you to go with her to welcome the relatives?" `
`"......Because I have work to do..." `
`"Liar. `
`...You don't actually have any work at all." `
`Shannon and Kanon had switched roles. `
`Normally, Kanon was the one in control, but when it came to romance, it was the opposite. `
`As Shannon had said, ...Jessica and Kanon were supposed to have been the ones to go greet the relatives at the harbor on Niijima. `
`However, Kanon had suddenly claimed that he had work to do, so Kumasawa had gone instead. `
`Kanon...didn't have any work to do. `
`Shannon knew this... `
`"Milady told me. `
`...Despite what happened after the cultural festival, she really does like you, Kanon-kun." `
`"......Even though I'm...furniture..." `
`"That's right. `
`And I'm furniture too." `
`"...But despite that, you're in love with a Human. `
`...Even though you can't do that." `
`"You think so...? `
`...Maybe we're furniture... `
`...just because we take that for granted." `
`"I don't have any special feelings for Milady Jessica. `
`...I only think of her as the daughter of the family we serve." `
`"Really...?" `
`"Really." `
`"........." `
`"...Wh-What?" `
`"You know, `
`......there is a chance... `
`that George-sama will propose to me tonight." `
`"......!" `
`Shannon wore an incredibly peaceful smile on her face, `
`...but Kanon could tell that there was no way she'd let him change the subject. `
`Kanon realized that she must've made him help out here in the guesthouse in order to talk to him about this, and he clicked his tongue softly... `
`"...You really think you can marry a Human, even though you're furniture?" `
`"I think I can." `
`"It won't work." `
`"Why not?" `
`"That dream future that George-sama has imagined for you two... is something you can never give him." `
`"...W-Well..." `
`"...We aren't Humans. `
`We're furniture, inferior to them. `
`George-sama only thinks that you're Human." `
`"...W-Well, that is true, but..." `
`"I'm impressed that you've managed to keep him fooled this long. `
`Do you really think you can keep tricking him like that forever? `
`Even though you still haven't been able to tell him that you're furniture?" `
`"...Being furniture or being Human...has nothing to do with this. `
`...I believe that George-sama will accept everything about me." `
`"And yet you don't have the courage to check and make sure." `
`"...... `
`...You know what? `
`...I think... `
`I'll accept his proposal." `
`As Shannon looked up at the ceiling, ...she spoke of the imagined future that she and George would create. `
`Though some anxiety over the future appeared on her face, `
`...so did the joy of knowing what it was like to live with love. `
`As Kanon watched this vivid dream he was being shown, `
`...he knew that none of his words would reach Shannon anymore... `
`"...Hmph...... `
`...You can just do what you want. `
`...Once you've said you'll do something, you can be incredibly stubborn." `
`"Yep. `
`...I want to live life my own way. `
`...I'd like to stop being afraid `
`over who's furniture and who's a Human." `
`"........." `
`Kanon walked over to the window silently. `
`...He saw the rose garden filled with boring, gray flowers in bloom... `
`He realized that Shannon was acting above her place. `
`And he knew that her tale had no chance of a happy ending. `
`...However, he also knew that no words of his `
`could change her mind now that she had made her decision. `
`"......In that case, `
`...it doesn't matter what I say. `
`...If I tell you to stop, you won't listen. `
`If I tell you to do what you want, you'll do what you want. `
`...Why are you talking to me about this? `
`It's not like you care what I have to say." `
`"What I want to know... `
`...is how you feel about Milady." `
`"...I have nothing to do with the two of you." `
`"Do you really... `
`...feel absolutely nothing `
`for Milady?" `
`"...No, I don't, as I keep telling you." `
`"Liar." `
`"What makes you think that's a lie?" `
`"I can tell. `
`I'm your Nee-san, aren't I?" `
`"You don't know. `
`You can't know what I'm feeling...!!" `
`"I do. `
`I know everything about you, Kanon-kun." `
`"If you really do know, then why did you ask?! `
`Your head and your heart are completely filled by George-sama, aren't they?!! `
`And it's that sincerity of yours that I love!! `
`That's why...I'm rooting for you in the only way I can!! `
`Otherwise, ...even I...!!" `
`"Even I?" `
`"Even I... `
`...wanted to love Milady...!!!" `
`Kanon finally turned to face her, honestly and openly telling her how he really felt. `
`That was what Shannon had wanted to hear. `
`And after hearing that, she pressed Kanon even further to reveal his true feelings. `
`"You can't leave it at that. `
`I won't let you." `
`"Then what should I do?!! `
`What do you want me to say?!!" `
`"Don't try to dodge by saying 'I wanted to love her'. `
`All you need to do is honestly tell me what you really feel." `
`"Milady is...too dazzling for me!! `
`The way she lives is dazzling, like the sun!! `
`That's why I love her...! `
`I was so happy when Milady stretched out her hand and asked me to walk with her!! `
`No, I still am happy!!" `
`"You love her, don't you?" `
`"Yes, I do!! `
`I love Milady!!" `
`Finally, `
`...Kanon confessed his feelings in their entirety. `
`In fact, by saying it aloud, he finally understood how he truly felt. `
`As passionate tears welled up in his eyes, `
`...Kanon finally accepted it... `
`He couldn't stop the tears from dripping down his face. `
`"Both of us are exactly the same, locked up on Rokkenjima and living without any hope at all...! `
`And yet, Milady was able to light her own path and create her own fate...! `
`She was so dazzling that I envied her!! `
`I felt as though, if I could be with her, ...I could find my true self, instead of being the pitiful person I am now...!!" `
`"When you turned down Milady's confession, `
`...were you sad?" `
`"I was!! `
`I never realized that a lie you make to yourself could be so sad, so painful, so excruciating!! `
`And I couldn't forgive myself for hurting Milady with that lie!! `
`I believed that I didn't have what it takes to ever fall in love again!!" `
`"But that wasn't true. `
`Do you know what's needed to fall in love? `
`It's something you can't get from anyone but yourself. `
`Being furniture or not has nothing to do with it. `
`If you decide for yourself that it won't work out, then it won't. `
`You mustn't leap to such rigid conclusions. `
`That's why I, overambitious furniture that I am, gave myself what's needed to fall in love. `
`So you have it too, Kanon-kun." `
`"You mean, I have what it takes to fall in love?" `
`"Yes. `
`If you won't give it to yourself, I'll give it to you." `
`"Thank you. `
`...I... `
`feel as though... `
`I can finally... `
`see the sea..." `
`"...I'm certain of it... `
`...George-sama will propose `
`to me tonight." `
`"........." `
`"When he does, I will accept. `
`...I intend to leave this island and start a new life in our new world." `
`"If that's the path you've chosen, `
`...then I have no say in the matter." `
`"I'll leave this island, ...and after that, ...I'll never return again. `
`...I'll have to say farewell to you, Kanon-kun." `
`"......... `
`...You're right. `
`...We won't...see each other again, will we?" `
`"If... `
`...if you do love Milady from the bottom of your heart, and if your feelings are at least as strong as my feelings for George-san, `
`......then you and I will have to settle whose feelings are really stronger." `
`"......N-Nee-san..." `
`"This way is best for both of us. `
`......Don't give up on your feelings for my sake." `
`"Even though my selfishness might keep you from your happiness...?" `
`"I realize that same thing about myself. `
`...I know that my happiness...will bring you pain." `
`We have no choice but to hurt each other. `
`As she said this, Shannon turned her back to Kanon... `
`As Kanon watched Shannon from behind, `
`...he was struck by her strength... `
`and the love she still felt for him despite everything. `
`"...Nee-san, `
`living with you...made me happy." `
`"Me too. `
`I wouldn't have lasted this long without you. `
`...And that's why I was able to meet George-san." `
`"Yeah. `
`And I wouldn't have realized how dazzling Milady is...if it weren't for you." `
`"I won't abandon the way I feel. `
`...I'll focus on that feeling alone, ignoring everything else, and I won't look away when I trample over your heart." `
`"...Me too. I won't use you as an excuse... `
`...to hide the way I really feel." `
`"Whether my love bears fruit... `
`or yours does, `
`...we'll both support the victor." `
`"Yes. `
`...I promise. `
`And if I win, `
`...I will love Milady...and treasure you." `
`"Thank you. `
`But if I win, `
`...I'll forget you and this island and leave this place forever." `
`"Yes. `
`...Whichever of us wins, `
`that person will pursue their love with all they've got. `
`...Even if they know that love will be unrequited." `
`"Yes. `
`After all, by now..." `
`{a:c: `
`""We...are not furniture.""} `
`The boat carrying the relatives docked at the harbor. `
`They left the boat one by one, making fun of Battler... `
`Gohda wasn't the only one to greet them. Kanon was there too. `
`"It has been quite some time, everyone. `
`Allow me to welcome you to Rokkenjima." `
`"...I hope that your long journey went smoothly. `
`Welcome to Rokkenjima..." `
`Ah, good, good. `
`Gohda complimented Kanon in a whisper. `
`Kanon ignored this, looking just a little sour, and continued to greet the incoming relatives. `
`"This is your first time meeting Gohda-san and Kanon-kun, isn't it, Battler-kun?" `
`"Uu-! `
`It's my first time meeting Battler too! `
`*giggle*!" `
`"Gohda-san's a great chef. `
`He's the only reason anyone'd ever want to come to this island." `
`"I am most honored. `
`Battler-sama, I do hope that you look forward to your meals during your stay." `
`"I can't wait...! `
`I'm counting on you!" `
`"Long time no see, Kanon-kun. `
`You seem to be in high spirits today. `
`That's great." `
`"...Y-You think so...?" `
`"Oh yes. Your face is looking brighter today. `
`Maybe it's your complexion, or maybe it's that your gaze looks a bit more gallant." `
`"Hahah, it must be a growing phase. `
`That's how a boy becomes a man." `
`"You usually look as though you're about to pass out from anemia. `
`You're a bit different today." `
`"You've got some spunk. `
`A boy can change a lot in just three days. `
`I guess this means even Kanon-kun's gettin' a bit more manly!" `
`"We aren't making fun of you, okay? `
`We're all complimenting you. *giggle*" `
`...Kanon had sworn to start changing the way he lived bit by bit. `
`However, he had only meant to change within himself, and hadn't expected that it would show on the outside. `
`He was a bit shocked to hear that his expression had changed so much... `
`that people had apparently noticed as soon as he opened his mouth. `
`No, `
`...maybe the real surprise was that his normal expression must've looked so incredibly sullen in comparison. `
`Gohda led the way up to the guesthouse. `
`Kanon brought up the rear, helping to carry some of Kumasawa's shopping. `
`"...Does...my face really look that bright today?" `
`"Hohohoh... `
`It looks that way to me as well. `
`...Did something good happen? `
`*giggle*giggle*" `
`Even Kumasawa was saying it. `
`...Kanon, unable to see what his own face looked like, hung his head in embarrassment. `
`...When they reached the rose garden, they could see the others streaming into the guesthouse. `
`Then, he saw Jessica running towards him from there. `
`...Is even Milady Jessica going to say that I'm in a good mood today? `
`Kanon hung his head even deeper. `
`And so, almost as though he couldn't control himself, Kanon spoke first. `
`"...Do I really look that different?" `
`"Huh? `
`A...hahahahahaha. `
`...Well, you know. `
`You aren't usually the type to come out and say hello of your own accord. `
`That's probably why everyone was surprised..." `
`"...... `
`...I apologize for not going with you earlier, Milady." `
`"Huh? `
`Oh, don't worry about that... `
`I'm the one who's sorry for asking you to come all the way out to Niijima with me to meet everyone... `
`I know how busy you must be today..." `
`"I...didn't have anything in particular to do. `
`...You were just so dazzling. `
`...So dazzling that I couldn't bear to be with you. `
`...I was just weak." `
`Jessica faltered, uncertain what Kanon was talking about. `
`However, she realized that this was something too important to be laughed off. `
`"...Did something happen, Kanon-kun...?" `
`"Shannon says... `
`...she's going to get married." `
`"......I see. `
`...So George nii-san is going to propose this time after all." `
`Jessica thought Kanon was sad because Shannon would be leaving, that this new mental state had caused the change in his behavior. `
`And Kanon realized that Jessica was probably thinking this. `
`...So, he spoke to her clearly and honestly. `
`Because he wanted her to know. `
`"I decided that `
`I would stop working here if Nee-san ever quit." `
`"...I know. `
`...So, are you going to quit too, Kanon-kun?" `
`"I'm not sure anymore. `
`...I feel that, if I quit, I might lose sight again of something you revealed to me, shining like the sun." `
`Jessica could only stare blankly, unable to understand what he was saying. `
`...However, she did realize that he was trying to tell her something important. `
`And so, she was able to accept that his next words were neither a lie nor a joke... `
`"Milady Jessica, I...love you." `
`"......I- `
`I love you too...!" `
`"You live your life like the sun, ...and I want to try walking that path alongside you. `
`I have a feeling that, with you, I'll be able to break free from the 'me' that I despised as furniture." `
`"You aren't furniture, Kanon-kun. `
`And you weren't born just so you could become a servant! `
`A boy your age should be enjoying life much, much more...! `
`Hah, hahahaha. `
`I'm dazzled too. `
`You're so dazzling, ...I can hardly see." `
`"This is...how I truly feel. `
`......I'm...sorry for trying to hide it for so long. `
`...I apologize for hurting you on that day, ...in my cowardice." `
`"That's okay. `
`Just hearing you say that...makes me happy." `
`"So, `
`...since I want to always be with you, `
`...I plan to stop being furniture. `
`I ask that you give me some time to do that. `
`...Please forgive this last bit of weakness." `
`"Th-There's nothing weak about you...! `
`You've shown me. `
`You've shown me that you have the incredible courage to change yourself from the way you used to be. `
`So, I'll support you until the end, and I won't rush you until you're ready." `
`"...If I'm the sun lighting your path, `
`that's because I wanted to shine more brightly than anyone else, so that you'd look only at me. `
`Without you, there's no way I'd become anything like a sun. `
`...So, I'll wait. `
`No matter how long it takes." `
`"Thank you, Milady." `
`"...'Milady' is a bit stiff, don't you think?" `
`"May I...call you by your name?" `
`"Sure. `
`......Oh, but only when we're alone, okay? `
`Otherwise, ...it might make things tough for you." `
`"...Good point. `
`Nee-san and George-sama are doing the same, it seems." `
`"If Shannon hadn't been about to get engaged, ...you wouldn't have said what you said just now, right?" `
`Kanon hung his head, at a loss for words for some time. `
`But it was true. `
`If Shannon hadn't told him about the engagement, he probably wouldn't have been having this conversation at this moment. `
`"......Yes. `
`...Because of that, I was able to think long and hard." `
`"Ah, come on. `
`You heard about Shannon, and you wanted to see what love felt like yourself, right?" `
`"Yes." `
`"...Th-That's a pretty straight answer. `
`...W-Well, when I watched those two, `
`...I was pretty jealous myself..." `
`In truth, it wasn't quite like that for either of them. `
`They'd been shown the courage needed to speak up...and tell the one you love how you feel. `
`That's what pushed both Kanon and Jessica forward. `
`"...So, ...what should I call you?" `
`"Jessica works fine." `
`"...Just saying it like that...would be a bit embarrassing." `
`"Then you can use 'san', at least at first. `
`Why not try it out? Come on." `
`"J......Jessica-san......" `
`"Good, that'll do for now. `
`And I'd like to call you by your name, Kanon-kun. `
`...You have a real name...besides Kanon, don't you? `
`I'll bet it has the character {p:0:音} in it, like Kanon does... `
`Wh-What could it be, ...heheh..." `
`"...My name is Yoshiya." `
`"O-Oh, ...how is it written?" `
`Jessica tried tracing out various characters on the palm of her hand. `
`...Then, Kanon used his own finger to write out his name on her hand... `
`"You write it as {p:0:嘉哉}..." `
`"...So, you're Yoshiya...kun... `
`...Yeah, that's a great name. `
`...Totally better than my weird name..." `
`"That's not true. `
`Milady Jessica has a wonderful na-" `
`"Hey, say it again...!" `
`"Huh? `
`...M-Milady Jessica has-" `
`"One more time!" `
`"M-Milady Jessica has a wonderful... Um, ...is something wrong?" `
`"...*giggle* `
`No big deal. `
`Thanks, `
`...Yoshiya...kun." `
`The red, red flowers of the rose garden seemed to celebrate the two lovers whose feelings had finally connected... `
`...The scene was watched by one not human, who gazed out quietly from beneath the rose garden arbor... `
`"............" `
`Come to think of it, those two had never called each other by their names until now. `
`Jessica hadn't known Kanon's true name. `
`Kanon hadn't called Jessica by her name. `
`When people call each other by name, they acknowledge the worth of the other's soul. `
`That's why names are sacred. `
`...When you've been given permission to say someone's name, it means they've acknowledged your soul. `
`"...Is that why... `
`...Father wants me to call him by his name...?" `
`No, `
`...that's probably wrong. `
`When Father sees me, it reminds him of that other me, ...the past me. `
`And I'm sure that 'me' called Father by name. `
`However, `
`...that probably doesn't mean Father would be happy to hear me call him by his name. `
`After all, `
`......I am me, `
`...and not the Beatrice Father knows well. `
`...What can I do... `
`...to help Father...? `
`How can I be useful to him? `
`After all, that's the only reason I was born... `
`Hanging her head, `
`Beatrice sat all alone in the Golden Land's arbor next to the rose garden... `
`And she...was watched by the Witch of Theatergoing and her miko as they sat across from each other... `
`"......Poor kid." `
`"I never thought I'd see you feel compassion for Beato..." `
`"...It'd be too cruel to call this Beato and the former Beato the same person. `
`They're completely different people." `
`It may be that, by the rules, this Beato is 'the' Beato. `
`...However, saying that would be horribly unfair to her. `
`"......Battler must be very depressed to have things end up this way after reviving his former rival." `
`"I sort of get Onii-chan's despair. `
`...But I can understand how this kid feels too. `
`...No person can become a replacement for another. `
`Not even a past version of that same person." `
`Compared to the young boy and girl who had found new versions of themselves by calling each other by their true names, `
`...this witch looked very feeble. `
`The witch knew that she was an illusion created in the image of the person she once was. `
`And she also knew that it would only hurt Battler if she were to try and pretend to be that person. `
`"......And despite all of that, this Beato wants to be useful to Battler. `
`...How admirable." `
`"Is that the purpose for the witch known as Beatrice?" `
`"...That is what she claims. `
`She says that she was created to be of service to Battler." `
`"So, a Beato who was born for Onii-chan's sake eventually commits a serial murder... `
`and drags Onii-chan into a bizarre game that she calls eternal torture? `
`I don't get it." `
`"I believe you also understand that one can become a different person over a thousand years..." `
`...At the very least, `
`Beatrice was once a pure creature who was born for Battler's sake. `
`It's also very clear that, in her current feeble state, `
`she doesn't possess any of the courage or motivation needed to bring about such fearsome serial murders. `
`That means...the sinister witch we all know `
`must have changed during the thousand years since her birth. `
`"...We keep getting this 'thousand years' business, `
`but I get the feeling that those words are just a metaphor for a really long time in the world of witches." `
`"As you get closer to the world of gods, the concept of time becomes increasingly vague. `
`Six years can become a thousand, and a thousand years can be nothing more than a quick nap. `
`...One can fit an eternity long enough to be deserving of the title 'hundred-year-old witch' in a mere two weeks..." `
`In other words, the pure Beato transformed into the cruel Beato... `
`...during six years that could be called a thousand... `
`So, does that mean something bad happened during those six years that made her hate Onii-chan? `
`"That doesn't make sense. `
`During those six years, Onii-chan not only stayed away from Rokkenjima, he even stopped using the Ushiromiya name. `
`...He had nothing to do with that change. `
`Her hatred has got to be totally misguided." `
`"........." `
`"Oh, so this is where you were... `
`Shall I make you some black tea...?" `
`"...Kumasawa-san, `
`...there's something I'd like to know." `
`"Hohoho... `
`Very well, what is it?" `
`"......My name is Beatrice, `
`...isn't it?" `
`"Yes, that is correct. `
`You are Beatrice-sama, Milady." `
`"However, ...the Beatrice that Father talks about...isn't me." `
`"...Well..." `
`"I think Father wanted me to be that person. `
`...I think that might be why... `
`He was disappointed because, no matter how much I looked like her, ...I am a different person." `
`"That isn't true... `
`You are you, Beatrice-sama herself. `
`...You have merely lost your memory of the past after being newly reborn... `
`Even without your memory, you are still Beatrice-sama. `
`You are the same person whom the Master loves." `
`"...So then, `
`...how can I regain those memories...?" `
`"Well......" `
`Beato looked at Kumasawa with hopeful eyes, as though praying that she would tell her the way. `
`...Kumasawa averted her gaze unhelpfully, as though trying to say that she'd like to, if only such a way existed... `
`"If I can't regain those memories, `
`...can't you at least tell me what kind of person the Beatrice Father loved was?" `
`"...Th-That much I can tell you, but..." `
`"{p:1:I was born for Father's sake}. `
`So, I want to become the Golden Witch Beatrice that Father desires." `
`"...B-Beatrice-sama..." `
`"I cannot use magic. `
`...However, if the witch Father desires could use it, then I will learn. `
`I want to become the witch he desires. `
`That's the only way I can repay Father for creating me." `
`"......That's admirable. `
`Without the thousand years gone wrong, she really is an incredible kid." `
`"A chick of a witch... Very interesting... `
`...I've taken a liking to her, Ange. `
`I shall allow this chick to make use of my library. `
`Let us open the door that leads back to the world of witches." `
`"...So, you're going to make her read aloud the stories about her previous self. `
`...Yes, I want to know too. `
`{i:The creation story} of the Golden Witch, Beatrice." `
`"...... `
`...Very well. `
`If you wish it, `
`...then let us open the door once more." `
`"...Kumasawa... `
`san..." `
`A golden splash welled up around them. `
`...It was a cloud of gold butterflies. `
`With a flash of gold, the form of the old lady transformed into that of a witch in a dress... `
`"You must choose the path that you are to walk down. `
`...Let us call it a path of roses. `
`The beautifully blooming roses may encourage you, and their thorns may torment you. `
`...But even so, it is a path that you've walked down before. `
`...You may pass through the same thousand years. `
`You may pass through a different thousand years. `
`If you wish, you may even return back the way you came." `
`"I'll move on forward. `
`...I don't want to spend a thousand years in this garden drinking tea. `
`...I, Beatrice, was born for Father's sake. `
`So I want to live for Father's sake. `
`Please tell me...about the Golden Witch." `
`...The great witch spread her arms, `
`communicating the other's unbending determination to the brilliant heavens. `
`At that moment, a brilliant light covered the two of them, `
`and before they knew it, they were in a strange study. `
`There sat the master of this library, the great old witch, and her miko. `
`...Virgilia gave a deep and elegant bow. `
`"...It is the greatest of honors to be in your presence, `
`Lady Featherine Augustus Aurora, the majestic Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating." `
`"Raise your head, child of man. `
`...I shall give that child the privilege of using my library however she likes for a time. `
`...Ange, my miko, `
`you will to see to her needs." `
`"Sure, sure, as you wish, my master. `
`...You know, you could just say 'let me read your story'." `
`"Miko of the Witch of Theatergoing, `
`...I leave Beatrice in your care." `
`"...Pleased... `
`...to meet you..." `
`"...... `
`...The Beatrice you're trying to become...was suffering from something, in her own way. `
`...At the very least, you've been released from that for the time being. `
`...Will you really go on a journey to regain those shackles...?" `
`"...Y-Yes. `
`...I want to become the Golden Witch. `
`...That is the reason I was born." `
`"I, the Endless and Finite Witch Publius Virgilia Maro, `
`ask that you make her journey through Purgatory a pleasant one, granting her your protection." `
`"Huh? Oh, uh... `
`...Let it be known that as the miko of the Witch of Theatergoing and as the Endless Witch and Apprentice Witch of Resurrection, `
`I, {f:5:Ange} Beatrice, do humbly accede to your request or whatever..." `
`Featherine snorted. `
`"...So, `
`...you also bear the name of Beatrice...?" `
`"......That's right. `
`I know a lot about you." `
`"Please teach me. `
`What kind of person was I?" `
`"Sure. `
`...And I'll want you to teach me. `
`Why did you become the person you were?" `
`"...In this library, the Fragments showing the tales of all your games up until now are stored as books. `
`By reading them, you should be able to learn everything that has happened before now..." `
`"By reading them, can I become a Golden Witch...?" `
`"...To become a Golden Witch, one must solve the epitaph of the gold. `
`...And this trial cannot be skipped, not even by Beatrice herself..." `
`"I-I'll do my best. `
`So please, let me read the books in this library...!" `
`"...As admirable as ever. `
`Why are you so set on ending up like that again...?" `
`"I do not know what I was like then. `
`...However, if that me can be of use to Father, `
`I want to become it." `
`Ange sighed resignedly. `
`...No words would stop this girl's feelings of respect. `
`...Ange was the miko of the Witch of Theatergoing. `
`She could do nothing but watch over the stage. `
`That's right. They weren't actually interfering with the play. `
`This was just a bit of directing, ...to shine the spotlight onto the tale of Beato's past. `
`Even this was nothing more than the Witch of Theatergoing watching a play. `
`"If you read, you will learn what kind of a person the old Beatrice was. `
`...However, you must decide what you will take from that experience... `
`...You are free to stay in this library, or leave it, or even return to it again later. `
`...In exchange, I will watch your play." `
`"You'll watch...my play?" `
`"...Basically, it means you can do whatever you want." `
`"Th-Thank you very much, Augauau...umm-" `
`"She likes it when you call her Featherine." `
`"Thank you very much, Featherine-sama..." `
`After being welcomed in by Featherine, ...Beato left on a journey to discover herself. `
`That tale connected the old tale with the new one. `
`It wove them together. `
`...The thousand-year-old tale about her returned to its starting point, becoming a snake eating its own tail. `
`The ring of that snake began slowly, bit by bit, to turn into the shape of a small island floating on the sea. `
`And that...was Rokkenjima. `
`The thousand years of the witch born on this island...were tied to the island. `
`Was it a thousand years, or just six? `
`...Or did this tale start even further back into the past? `
`Beatrice went out on a journey to find herself... `
`The wind had been strengthening since a while back. `
`The breaking waves had grown fierce. `
`The ferryboats probably wouldn't be coming for a while now. `
`The crashing thunder told that the island had been sealed off from the outside world. `
`A thick rain poured down, `
`mocking the fools outdoors who had to rush pathetically to find shelter. `
`No longer would anyone be able to leave this island. `
`...And no longer would anyone be able to reach this island. `
`...No one, unless blessed with a miracle. `
`There was another flash of lightning. `
`...The retinas of all who saw it were filled with white. `
`As that white faded away, `
`...an eerie shadow pulled itself up amidst the raging waters of the beach... `
`As though suddenly remembering to do so, it coughed violently several times, `
`filthily spitting out the sea water that had filled its stomach. `
`...She then tore apart the touch fastener of her life jacket... `
`and threw down the reason she had been able to float here without so much as a thank you. `
`"Hahahahahahaha, `
`ahahahahahahahaha!! `
`Gurgh, `
`*cough*cough*cough*, `
`haah, haah, haah... `
`...*cackle*cackle*, ahahahahahahaha!! `
`Welcomed in by a storm, same as always! Very <good>! `
`Yes, come and entertain me, Battler-san!!" `
