`As usual, this year's family conference was getting bogged down. `
`Everyone had decided to cool their heads for a moment, and a short break had been agreed upon... `
`The four siblings could say whatever they wanted, `
`but Natsuhi and Kyrie, for example, were outsiders and found it difficult to speak freely in this sort of atmosphere. `
`A conference where you aren't allowed to say what you want...can be tiring even as you just sit there quietly. `
`Even Kyrie couldn't help letting out a deep sigh... `
`"........." `
`This was the second floor hallway of the mansion. `
`Rudolf had wanted to be alone during the break, so she had felt like doing the same... `
`and had drifted up the stairs to reach this place. `
`Kyrie's expression was less tightly controlled than when her husband was around. `
`...She wore a tired look that she didn't often show. `
`She pressed her cheek against the cool window glass. `
`I need to regain my spirit and support my husband. `
`Even if I'm not allowed to speak. `
`...That's the duty I've won. `
`"......Who is it?" `
`She suddenly sensed another person, turned around to look behind her, `
`and saw Jessica standing at the other end of the hallway. `
`"........." `
`"Oh, it's you, Jessica-chan. `
`...Didn't you go to the guesthouse?" `
`"...Well, `
`...I sort of decided to head back to my room to get a book." `
`"I see. `
`And you're on your way back to the guesthouse now?" `
`"Y-Yes. `
`That's right..." `
`"I can't stand this rain. `
`Is the wind really strong...?" `
`"It's weak right now, relatively speaking..." `
`As Kyrie looked out the window, ...Jessica watched her back, looking agitated... `
`"...Aunt Kyrie, `
`...I'm sorry, but you've only got your bad luck to blame..." `
`"Ah, Zepar! `
`Jessica's roulette of fate has chosen Kyrie!" `
`"What will you do, Jessica?! `
`The roulette has chosen Kyrie, but you may reject that choice and spin the roulette again if you wish!" `
`""It doesn't matter whose life is sacrificed for this trial...!!"" `
`Jessica wasn't like George. `
`George had willingly chosen Eva to be his sacrifice, `
`to signify his separation from his old life so that he could step into a new life married to Shannon. `
`However, Jessica hadn't thought of any particular target. `
`...So, she had left it up to the roulette of fate. `
`That was no exaggeration. `
`...She had walked around at random, imposing a rule on herself that the first person she met would be chosen as her sacrifice. `
`And so, ...the roulette of fate had brought her to Kyrie... `
`Of course, there was nothing forcing her to keep to that rule. `
`However, Jessica didn't want to break a rule she had once made. `
`...Even though she was participating in a demons' game, she still wanted to cling to this one last virtue... `
`Right now, she could attack that unprotected back... `
`But Jessica still wasn't able to fully resolve herself. `
`"...... `
`...What is it? `
`Do you have something to say to me...?" `
`Noticing the strange distance Jessica was standing at, Kyrie turned around. `
`...That unprotected back was already gone. `
`Jessica realized that her hesitation had made her lose her own first chance... `
`...She had taken on this demons' game to prove her love for Kanon. `
`However, `
`...would it really be okay to sell her soul to demons... `
`for the sake of love...? `
`She had energetically consented to this demon's game, not wanting to let George, who had already taken an open-minded view of the situation, get any more of a lead on her, but... `
`...Her heart still wasn't ready... `
`"Umm, ...... `
`...maybe I shouldn't be asking you this, Aunt Kyrie..." `
`"...What is it? `
`It's rare for you to ask me questions, Jessica-chan. `
`I hope I'm capable of answering them for you." `
`"Actually, umm, ......I... `
`have someone I like." `
`"Oh, really? `
`That's wonderful, *giggle*. `
`Then is it love you wanted to talk about...?" `
`"...H-Heheheh... `
`...Yeah, ...pretty much." `
`"...Very well. `
`I'll help out if I can." `
`"Th-Thank you very much... `
`...Actually, umm..." `
`"Is it still one-sided?" `
`"No, ...I guess you could say that it's just become mutual... `
`But, well, ...there's this trial...for us to be joined together..." `
`"A trial? `
`Now, what could that be?" `
`"...There's the two of us and another pair of lovers, ...and we have to fight each other." `
`"You mean a love triangle? `
`Or is it a square...? `
`Sounds complicated. `
`...And?" `
`"Only the pair who wins can be together... `
`...It's something complicated like that. `
`In other words-" `
`"......That sounds awful. `
`...A love where neither side can succeed unless they use the others as stepping stones." `
`"Yes... `
`...If we're joined, ...then they'll fall apart. `
`...And the same the other way around." `
`"...I think I see where you're going with this. `
`...Something like this, right? `
`"How far is a person allowed to take advantage of others to find happiness", ...right?" `
`"........." `
`Yes, ...Kyrie was very smart. `
`She had already guessed the question that Jessica had wanted to ask most... `
`"If you don't fight, it automatically becomes their victory, and you'll lose. `
`...However, if you fight and win, it means they'll fall apart. `
`...It's nasty either way. `
`However, the answer is obvious." `
`"......Yes..." `
`Kyrie giggled. `
`...If she wasn't willing to stick to her love until the end, then that would show the limits of their relationship. `
`If that were the case, she should just let the other pair of lovers win. `
`However, if this was a love she couldn't abandon... `
`...She couldn't abandon her chances at victory either. `
`So, ...she had no options other than to fight. `
`In the end, Jessica's hesitation was caused by guilt `
`over forcing the others to split apart as the result of her inevitable decision... `
`"...I guess... `
`I really am... `
`just looking for an excuse..." `
`"Yes. `
`...That's what you're doing." `
`"......... `
`...Still, ...that doesn't make it any easier to step over someone else `
`for the sake of your own love..." `
`"In that case, `
`...will you give up on your lover?" `
`"...That's..." `
`"I can tell you one thing for certain. `
`Doing that will be even more painful. `
`You'll be forced to crawl through hell. `
`...For the rest of your life." `
`A hardness had entered Kyrie's gaze... `
`"...I was just six, so I don't remember much about that time. `
`However, I found Mom's notebook among her belongings after she died." `
`"Was it a diary...?" `
`"It was more a collection of her thoughts. `
`It was much vaguer than a diary would've been. `
`...I found it and read it right after she passed away, `
`...but I needed to wait until I'd grown for several years before I could understand it." `
`"...I see. `
`...So, did it speak of Kyrie's worries about her marriage?" `
`"It was...practically a book of curses. `
`...It cleared up several questions I'd vaguely felt back when I was six." `
`When I was six, it seemed as though my parents were very close and had no problems. `
`...And though I thought it odd that Onii-chan lived separately, `
`even though he was in our family, `
`I accepted it as the way things were. `
`"Did you not know about Asumu?" `
`"...I think Onii-chan talked to me about her when no one was around, but it wasn't something a kid who wasn't even in elementary school could understand. `
`...After all, I never even saw a picture of her. `
`...Mom had sent all of the pictures with Asumu-san in them to Onii-chan, leaving none behind in the house." `
`To Ange, and to Battler, who only rarely came home, `
`...Kyrie's smile never faltered. `
`If she hadn't written her thoughts in that notebook, Ange would probably never have known them. `
`Since his school days, Rudolf had been particularly popular with girls, a typical playboy. `
`Be bold, over the top, yet still just a little bit gentle towards women. `
`He probably kept that formula for being popular with women inside his head. `
`In their attempts to win Rudolf's favor, several women tried various seductive tricks. `
`Rudolf probably enjoyed that part the most. `
`Since the beginning, love had been a game to Rudolf. `
`He never thought of it as a trial and error process to find a single life partner. `
`He would intentionally spark jealousy between women, lap up their compliments, and revel in the harem. `
`...He may be my father, ...but he was an awful man. `
`"But at the same time, Dad must've looked down on those toadying girls. `
`...Mom, who was very aware of her self-worth and extremely intelligent, must've stood out." `
`"...Though even that might have been due to Kyrie's more skillful methods of catching Rudolf's gaze." `
`"...... `
`...Yeah, maybe. `
`Mom was smart in a lot of ways." `
`Like the other Ushiromiya siblings, Rudolf had strong ambitions and lofty goals. `
`Under the mottos of "if you can pull it off, you're golden" and "as long as no one finds out", `
`he would alternate between setting up businesses that were borderline swindles or illegal, then running away. `
`I've heard that in his college years, he was already making use of that talent, thinking up shameless projects and cleverly making money through the panic selling of party tickets, `
`so much so that he could brag about carrying a wallet full of a hundred 10,000 yen notes all the time... `
`Many women fell for his charisma in being the man responsible for these radical projects, ...as well as his thick wallet and generosity. `
`...It would be a lie to say that Kyrie wasn't one of them. `
`However, what made Kyrie very different from the other women... `
`...was that she could support Rudolf as a business partner. `
`Rudolf would make a large-scale party successful, unable to hide his laughter at this massive easy profit. `
`The women would surround him. `
`Among them, only Kyrie was calm and composed. ...She could point out several ways that income and expenditure could be improved upon, `
`and could even lay out a proposal for the next project. `
`"So, ...Rudolf slowly began to accept her as a partner." `
`"......Just like some people say men don't belong in the kitchen, `
`...there's also a sense that women should stay out of financial affairs. `
`...It's normal for men to foot the bill for women. `
`...And the details of how those 10,000 yen notes were scrounged up are vulgar, so they don't ask, don't know, don't care." `
`"So, you're saying that Kyrie viewed money from a man's perspective..." `
`Rudolf noticed a true treasure in this part of Kyrie. `
`He knew exactly how much hard work it took to get just one of those 10,000 yen notes. `
`So, somewhere inside him, he had looked down upon those extravagant women who never even considered the efforts he had undertaken. `
`...Of all of them, only Kyrie had possessed the same sharp financial intuition as Rudolf... `
`Every time he thought of a new plan, he would talk to Kyrie about it, work out the kinks, and make it succeed. `
`In this way, Kyrie steadily worked her way up until she was the number one of Rudolf's large group of followers. `
`"But Mom was still a woman. `
`...I doubt she enjoyed seeing Dad pampered by all those other girls." `
`"...So, she would rather have been his only one, instead of his number one..." `
`"Yeah. `
`Though she served as Dad's right hand, she slyly got rid of the other women in the shadows. `
`...It was only a matter of time before Mom would succeed in her love." `
`"When did Asumu come into the picture?" `
`"...She was one of Rudolf-san's groupies. `
`...No, not even that. `
`She was just one of his fans." `
`"Did you ever talk with her...?" `
`"Of course. `
`...I knew her well. `
`Ever since the very beginning, before Rudolf-san even knew her name. `
`......I'm sure she was quite intelligent herself. `
`And cunning. `
`...I tried to use my intelligence to stick out, ...but she did it in the exactly opposite way." `
`"...By being...stupid...?" `
`"*giggle* `
`...I mean she was good at triggering his protective instinct. `
`Out of all the girls who came to flatter and flirt with him, `
`...only she stood out with every action she made, unlike the flashy girls Rudolf-san had tired of." `
`...Kyrie still acknowledges the mistake she made in letting Asumu and Rudolf get too close. `
`Kyrie had thought that taking the role of Rudolf's business partner meant she would have him all to herself. `
`...That might have been due to her pride. `
`And, it might have been her arrogance, as she tried to eliminate the relationships between all the other girls and Rudolf. `
`Perhaps she sometimes tried too hard as a business partner, `
`putting too much pressure on him, regardless of the fact that it was justified. `
`Bit by bit, Rudolf had started to need a woman who could stay quiet and soothe him, `
`...without making him think about anything complicated. `
`......That woman was Asumu. `
`"I am ruthless and intellectual. `
`Rational and economical. `
`...In a plank of Carneades situation, I would push the other person off without hesitation. `
`...I thought that was the kind of partner suitable for him." `
`However, though that ruthlessness had made her reliable on the business side of things... `
`...It might have disturbed Rudolf deeply `
`outside of business. `
`At some point, ...though Rudolf still acknowledged Kyrie's skill, he began to yearn for a quiet, warm acceptance. `
`Asumu had satisfied all of those conditions. `
`She would never talk about anything complicated. `
`Even if he did, she would just shake her head to say she didn't know. `
`However, she would care more for him physically than anyone else, quietly putting a blanket on him and staying by his side until morning... `
`"...Yes, I did get the position of his business partner. `
`...But before I knew it, `
`...Rudolf-san had grown a need for a mental partner, someone who could heal his heart. `
`Though I foolishly claimed to be the intellectual one, I never noticed." `
`"......And then, `
`...Uncle Rudolf... `
`married Aunt Asumu...?" `
`"......... `
`...Yes, that's right. `
`She stole him away by sleeping with him." `
`"........." `
`"He had slept with a lot of women. `
`...By that point, he wasn't the kind of guy to let his emotions be captured by a woman just because he slept with her. `
`After all, sleeping with women was just a game to him. `
`...That's why I used something other than my body to attract his attention." `
`"...What pride `
`as a woman..." `
`"Before long, they were both pregnant. `
`...Asumu-san told Dad about it right away, but Mom did the opposite." `
`"......So, she was afraid that the pregnancy would threaten her position as his business partner..." `
`"Apparently, Mom didn't eat much at the time, so her period was often irregular. `
`Because of that, it took a really long time before she realized she was pregnant." `
`"When did she notice...?" `
`"...It was after Asumu-san suddenly moved into Dad's family register. `
`...Mom learned about her pregnancy after that and plotted several times to split Asumu-san and Dad apart, but..." `
`"Even though Asumu-san...always acted like such an airhead, `
`...once she got her hands on Rudolf-san, she didn't let go. `
`"Why should I care? Please stay out of our way"...she'd say. `
`...And this coming from that little girl who would curl up into a ball every time she got on a bus." `
`"......At that point, I realized. `
`...She had been the truly cunning one. `
`...Yes, even her fear of vehicles was another lie to catch Rudolf-san's sympathy. `
`........." `
`"......My apologies. `
`I must be boring you." `
`"Oh, ...no......" `
`"At the very least, `
`I wanted him to acknowledge the child I would give birth to. `
`...It seems as though Rudolf-san was prepared to do that. `
`He made sure there was a hospital waiting for me, and even though Asumu-san was close to giving birth herself, he gallantly came to see me. `
`......Even though she was already his wife. `
`What an awful man, really..." `
`After that...is a tale I can't bear even to tell. `
`Both Asumu and I...had the same delivery date. `
`And yet, her pregnancy had meant her marriage, ...where mine was completely meaningless. `
`I swore to bring up my child well and have Rudolf-san acknowledge it. `
`The fight between Asumu-san and me ended with my loss. `
`...However, I wasn't down for the count. `
`If I could make my child excel far more than Asumu-san's, `
`...if I could make it fully acknowledged by Rudolf-san, ...I would be rewarded. `
`......That's what I believed. `
`"However, ...that child was a stillbirth." `
`"Yeah. `
`...Asumu-san gave birth to Onii-chan. `
`...But Mom didn't give birth to anyone. `
`...Even Mom's final hope of being left a spot as Dad's second wife...was destroyed..." `
`Kyrie had fallen from being his partner to being his second wife, `
`...and then, unable to give birth to the bond of a child, ...she tumbled down...to being merely his mistress. `
`I can't imagine... `
`...how much she must have hated Asumu and that kid, ...Battler. `
`"...And despite that, `
`...Mom was able to act in a very friendly way towards Onii-chan. `
`...It was definitely a shock for me. `
`To think that my gentle mother...had held such negative emotions for Onii-chan...and had managed to hide them." `
`"...... `
`...She must have despised Battler." `
`"Probably. `
`...If Asumu-san had had a stillbirth and Mom had given birth to Onii-chan, `
`...history might have changed in some way. `
`Had that been the case, `
`it seems she would've wanted to set up some scenario in which she'd make Dad divorce Asumu-san and marry her instead." `
`"...Was that...also written in that book where she kept her thoughts?" `
`"Yeah. `
`...After all, that was just a random thought, a delusion. `
`...Mom's resentment, as she chewed on the corner of her tear-stained bed sheets." `
`"There's just one thing I regret." `
`"...You mean...the pregnancy?" `
`"No, no. `
`...It's my arrogance I regret. `
`"......Rudolf-san is mine now, so I'm completely safe." `
`"...I'll never lose to that Asumu kid." `
`...When she was busy screaming her head off on buses and planes, I was capable of properly managing the arrangements and expenditures for them. `
`...And so, I was overly confident...that I was the one Rudolf-san trusted the most." `
`"........." `
`"They say love needs to be nurtured, right?" `
`"...Y-Yeah." `
`"That's not wrong. `
`...The two of you need to water it, care for it, and nurture it. `
`...And in the end, it will finally bear the fruit called love. `
`Did you know? `
`Love doesn't end when it bears fruit. `
`...If you don't harvest it as well, the romance you started with will never amount to anything." `
`"......Harvest it...?" `
`"You need to think about that yourself, Jessica-chan. `
`...If you make it bear fruit without harvesting it, it can sometimes grow rotten. `
`And bugs will often gather around it. `
`In fact, ...sometimes thieves will come by and pluck it off the branch." `
`"........." `
`"Young kids like you, Jessica-chan, think that love ends with nurturing. `
`...That is naive. `
`...If you don't harvest it, you will never be rewarded for your love." `
`"Harvest...love..." `
`"At a glance, it may seem to be a matter just between the pair of lovers, but that isn't true. `
`Putting off the harvest because you assume you can do it at any time...just gives thieves a chance. `
`...What if that fruit you've worked so hard to nurture gets pulled off the branch the next morning? `
`...You'll regret that you didn't choose to harvest it the previous day instead of complaining. `
`...That regret really hurts. `
`...It'll make you crawl through hell." `
`"........." `
`"I'm lucky. `
`My hell ended after 18 years. `
`...So, I'll never misjudge myself again. `
`...That person is mine. `
`I won't let him get away. I won't let him out of my sight. `
`And I'm grateful to my master... `
`for giving me that chance. `
`My "certain willpower" in not giving up on that man no matter what...was answered with a "miracle"." `
`By now, Jessica was speechless...and didn't even urge Kyrie to continue. `
`...This true form of love that Kyrie was telling her about... `
`was far, far more harsh than anything she had imagined... `
`"Right now, `
`...I would do anything to keep Rudolf-san by my side. `
`And I will show no mercy against his enemies. `
`...If he wished it, I might not even hesitate at murder." `
`"......And because I finally resolved myself to doing that on the 18th year, `
`...that certain willpower... `
`...brought about a miracle for me. `
`...You know, miracles only appear for those who can bring them to completion themselves." `
`Asumu's death had not been a murder of any sort. `
`However, Kyrie had constantly cursed her and hoped for her death, `
`...and finally, on the 18th year, she had built up the determination to kill her with her own hands. `
`And, ...she actually had...gotten herself a blade to do the deed with...... `
`That was when the miracle had occurred... `
`"...Aunt Asumu passing away...was a miracle..." `
`"Wrong. `
`...That wasn't even close to a miracle." `
`"......Huh?" `
`"After all, `
`...if she hadn't died, I would have killed her. `
`...In other words, she was fated to die no matter what. `
`...The miracle is that, even though she did die, `
`"I didn't have to get my hands dirty". `
`That's all." `
`...Until now, Kyrie had never shown Jessica... `
`...no, she had never even shown Rudolf...that glint in the deepest depths of her eyes. `
`It told plainly and clearly `
`that romance and love are not the sweet and fluffy candies that young girls imagine them to be. `
`Jessica was overwhelmed by that pressure...and stunned silent. `
`And she had to acknowledge it. `
`This was...the power of will that could make love be realized. `
`With the force of this willpower, Kyrie had supported Rudolf as a wife. `
`And it was the same as George's. `
`...He had already developed and proven that he had the willpower `
`to oppose all obstacles to love between different classes. `
`Right now, ...Jessica could clearly understand. `
`This was the magnitude of George's determination, `
`which had allowed him to coldly carry out his part of the trial... `
`Then, ...what about her......? `
`Did she really have the resolve to make her love with Kanon bear fruit... `
`and to then harvest that fruit......? `
`"*giggle* I'm sorry. `
`You probably just wanted a little advice, and I've scared you... `
`...*giggle*giggle* `
`Blame the weather. `
`I just wanted to pressure you a bit, but I've gone overboard." `
`Kyrie let a relaxed smile rise to her face. `
`The tense atmosphere finally slackened. `
`...However, her words had been gouged into Jessica's heart. `
`"I don't know what your love has been like, Jessica-chan, `
`......but if you have a rival and neither is willing to back down, you can't let yourself become complacent. `
`...If you do, you'll end up like me. `
`......For the sake of love, `
`a woman should be prepared to kill at least once in her life. `
`...I can tell you that all women in the world who call themselves mothers have been through that." `
`After all... `
`"Women who don't do that are chewed to bits by the others and forced to crawl through the hell of envy and regret for the rest of their lives. `
`......My hell lasted 18 years. `
`...I was lucky to be pardoned after just 18 years. `
`...That hell is still filled with women...who will never get out until they die. `
`...Unless they execute themselves in their regret." `
`"...... `
`...How should I put it... ...I have nothing...to say." `
`"*giggle* `
`...I was trying to cheer you on, but here I've gone and scared you too much. `
`...I'm truly sorry. `
`...Love can be much more easygoing than that, okay? `
`Love really is like playing with fire. `
`Anyone can play easily and lightheartedly. `
`...But when you mess up and get burned, that scar stays with you your whole life. `
`...*giggle*giggle*giggle*." `
`Regrets from love never fade. `
`That was all that Kyrie had been trying to communicate. `
`...It wasn't like Kyrie to start telling stories from her past—stories you would normally expect her to avoid—instead of giving a brief answer. `
`However, ...Kyrie might have thought Jessica deserved to hear. `
`Jessica had timidly brought up the subject of love. `
`...Perhaps Kyrie had opened up and told everything `
`because she had seen the fires of Jessica's determination in her eyes. `
`"Okay, I need to head back soon. `
`...Let's keep what we've talked about a secret, okay? `
`Heheheh..." `
`With a mysterious smile on her face, Kyrie turned around. `
`......I wonder if I scared her too much. `
`Still, it's a hundred times better to learn of that hell from a warning. `
`...Once you've fallen into it, it's already too late. `
`Good luck, Jessica-chan. `
`It sounds complicated, but don't lose. `
`Heheh, it's not every day I get to act as a mentor... `
`"...Hmm? `
`What is it, Jessica-chan...?" `
`Huh...... `
`A windstorm grazed Kyrie's head. `
`It had been a hair's breadth away. `
`If Kyrie hadn't twisted her body slightly, that fist would probably be buried in her face by now. `
`A bitter smile rose to Jessica's face when she saw that her first strike had failed to land a kill... `
`"Just so you know, I didn't strike you unawares out of cowardice... `
`...I hoped to end it with a single painless strike before you realized what was happening..." `
`"...Didn't I tell you that I've lived through the hell of jealousy? `
`I've been nearly burned a couple times already. `
`I know how it feels just before a surprise attack." `
`"You mean you could sense it...?" `
`"That, plus the lie you told in the beginning." `
`"...A lie?" `
`"Come now. `
`If you had come from the guesthouse to get a book from your room, you wouldn't have come through this hallway in that direction. `
`...Of the seven reasons you might have had for lying, which chessboard theory led me to, `
`this was the worst-case scenario." `
`Telling a hasty lie to Kyrie would only put her on her guard. `
`If Jessica hadn't told that lie, her surprise attack would have succeeded. `
`"......Not bad. `
`...I should have expected it from you, ...Aunt Kyrie." `
`"Why? `
`You were planning to kill me from the beginning." `
`"It didn't matter who it was." `
`"How horrible." `
`"It's what you said that gave me the boost I needed. `
`......Thanks a lot..." `
`"...Wha......?!" `
`Kyrie dodged the punch, placed her hand against that fist, and slammed it against the wall. `
`Normally, Jessica would have hurt her hand on the wall and `
`rolled around clutching at it in pain... `
`However, Jessica's fist `
`had left what looked like a meter-wide crater in the wall. `
`Instead of wearing a look of anguish, `
`Jessica clicked her tongue in irritation at having missed... `
`"...Incredible. `
`I see that you are your father's daughter. `
`Have you taken up boxing too...?" `
`Impossible... Jessica is barehanded. `
`She isn't holding any sort of weapon at all...! `
`"......Please don't resist, Aunt Kyrie. `
`Just one strike to the head... `
`I won't let you feel a thing." `
`Kyrie tried to look confident, but she couldn't hide her confusion at this unreal destructive force. `
`If that punch had hit, her head probably would have split open like Jessica had said, killing her without any pain. `
`"Here I go......" `
`"......!!!" `
`If Kyrie's kick off the ground and backward leap had been an instant slower, her gut would probably have been pulverized. `
`Though she had avoided it by a hair, `
`Jessica's left body blow was followed by a terrible burst of wind, like an explosion, which blew Kyrie back. `
`"...Is this a dream? `
`Am I still sleeping?! `
`I-I don't understand!" `
`This Jessica looked like the normal Jessica, but something was different...! `
`It wasn't human, and common sense didn't apply to it! `
`This had to be...some kind of nightmare...!! `
`Kyrie slowly stood up. `
`Then, she looked at Jessica, noticed the several meters between them... `
`and realized just how far that blast of wind had sent her flying. `
`"......Feel free to hate me. `
`...However, `
`...just like you, `
`...I cannot back down. `
`......I can't let... `
`my love... `
`...end half-baked either." `
`"......What are you talking about...? `
`Hey, what are you saying?! What on earth is going on?! `
`Someone, tell meeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!" `
`The scene around Jessica seemed to bend like a heat wave. `
`It seemed to be enshrouding her fists. `
`...And, it seemed as though something like a red magic circle had appeared beneath her feet. `
`It looked just like a Western demon standing amidst the flames of hell. `
`"...Flame upgrade. `
`...Mass upgrade. `
`...Armor-piercing upgrade." `
`Each time Jessica muttered, her fists were surrounded by a pulsating, sinister red light. `
`...Those fists, which were actually smoking, `
`surely represented... `
`...the iron hammers of hell wielded by demons... `
`"G-Goodbye!! This is just a nightmare...!!" `
`Kyrie dashed away with lightning speed. `
`Yes. Right now, that was her best option. `
`Fortunately, she was smart enough to realize that pinching her cheek wasn't the best way to wake up from this nightmare. `
`"...Ronove." `
`When Jessica muttered once more, a blood-red magical barrier cut across the corridor. `
`Kyrie slammed into it hard and realized that her path of escape had been cut off. `
`"Gah... `
`...M- `
`Make this stop... I don't understand...!! `
`This is... `
`...a nightmare... `
`...It's a nightmare... `
`...Let me wake up, `
`...quickly..." `
`"...Yes, this is a nightmare... `
`...If you want, I'll wake you up right now. `
`...Just one strike... Don't move..." `
`Wielding her flames, Jessica slowly stepped forward towards her... `
`Each time her foot lifted off the floor, ...a scorching steam hung around her footprint... `
`This was...a true nightmare... `
`...Kyrie clutched her head in her hands, shaking it over and over again... `
`"It's a nightmare, right...? `
`This is...a nightmare, isn't it......? `
`Please, tell me it is...!!" `
`"Yeah, it's a nightmare." `
`"It is, right...? `
`It's a nightmare, right...? `
`Ah, ...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!" `
`"I acknowledge it. `
`...This is a nightmare." `
`"I do too!! `
`I acknowledge that this is a nightmare!! S-So-" `
`"I'll wake you up, just one strike. `
`Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!" `
`"Ack...gghaagh......??" `
`Jessica's neck was twisted at an odd angle, `
`...and she staggered backwards, her eyes white, `
`as though she didn't have a clue what had just happened. `
`In her forehead, ...a demon stake was buried at an angle. `
`It pulled itself out of her, spun around, then became Leviathan and landed. `
`The hole left behind in Jessica's head spewed blood. `
`"Leviathan of Envy, right here...!" `
`"If we're already inside a nightmare, ...why not have a friend from my nightmares show up? `
`My friend from the hell of envy. `
`Thanks for showing up just in the nick of time." `
`"...It's too early to thank me. `
`She's...not down yet...!!" `
`"...Gah......gah..." `
`Even though she had taken a deep gouge to the top of the head, `
`...Jessica just stood there, convulsing and white-eyed, and didn't fall over. `
`The blood stopped pouring out of her forehead, ...and her blank, doll-like eyes returned. `
`Then, she slowly pressed her own hand against the wound in her forehead. `
`...There was a *sizzle*, as though she had pressed a hot iron against it. `
`It was easy to tell that she was doing this to seal up the wound. `
`If Kyrie didn't escape now, there would never be another chance...! `
`"Can I defeat her...?!" `
`"No such luck. `
`...She's immortal, thanks to a contract with one of the great demons...!" `
`"Because of love!! `
`That's why she's immortal!!" `
`"Yes, love is magnificent! `
`Those with our blessings cannot be killed!!" `
`"Can we break that red magic wall?" `
`"Ronove-sama is also a great demon. `
`There's nothing I can do...!" `
`"Can we escape through the window?" `
`"That was blocked `
`by Ronove-sama's barrier a while ago...!" `
`"Incredible... So, has she sold her soul to demons for the sake of love?" `
`"How could she make so many contracts with great demons...?! `
`Aah, I'm so jealous...!!" `
`"......... `
`...Armor upgrade. `
`...All-attribute defense, `
`counter-attacking armor upgrade." `
`In response to these words, this time her entire body pulsated with a red light. `
`...She had upgraded herself with a defensive power that would prevent Leviathan's attacks from working again... `
`"What's she talking about...?" `
`"...Self-augmentation. `
`It's a kind of enchantment. `
`...Right now, she has enough defensive power to stop me from piercing her, `
`and she even has the ability to reflect that damage back upon the attacker! `
`...She's no longer Human. She's a monster...!!" `
`"Oh, so that's all? `
`Then not much has changed." `
`"How can you say that?" `
`"Just like in the very beginning, we still have no chance of winning...!!" `
`"...... `
`...That hurt. `
`...But it won't...work again." `
`Jessica slowly `
`lifted the hand that had been covering her forehead, `
`...and there was no longer any hole there. `
`The hall was cut off by barriers on both sides, and even the windows were sealed. `
`There was no way out. `
`"Is the door to this room sealed?" `
`"No, it's just locked. `
`...But it's just a normal room. `
`It does have a window, but that's already been sealed. `
`In other words, it's a closed room, and a coffin for us...!" `
`"A coffin is just what I need. Unlock it. `
`...Aah, I'm jealous, why are you the only one who can unlock it?!!!" `
`Leviathan's stake flew about at high speeds, ramming itself into the keyhole to that room. `
`The tip of the stake had become a key. `
`As soon as it was unlocked, the door flew open. `
`Both of them fell into the room and quickly locked it. `
`This was probably...Krauss's study. `
`Its soothing furnishings brought about a sense of nobility that Krauss would probably like. `
`"Even if you lock the door, she can just smash through it with one punch!! `
`You've just put the lid on your own coffin!!" `
`"However, if she wants to land a killing blow on us inside this coffin, she'll have to take the lid off first!" `
`"......?" `
`With dim eyes, Jessica tilted her head upon hearing Kyrie's words. `
`"......What are you talking about...? `
`...How will such a small room...be able to protect you, Aunt Kyrie...?" `
`"This room may be a closed room. `
`It may leave us with no method of escape. `
`However, even you can't break into this room. `
`That's what a closed room is!" `
`"...What are you talking about...? `
`How does this tiny room, `
`...with its tiny door, make you think you can escape me...?" `
`Jessica wearily looked between her own burning fists and the door `
`with a confused expression on her face. `
`Then, slowly, ...she sent that pulsating, red light to her fists... `
`She repeatedly enchanted her fists to give them the destructive power for the killing blow. `
`"...I'll smash this door to bits......" `
`"If you think you can, `
`give it a try." `
`"K-Kyrieeeeeee...!!" `
`After sealing the door and calmly saying those words, Kyrie placed a single index finger on the door. `
`Jessica slowly... `
`...raised her fire-wreathed demon's fists... `
`"...So long, Aunt Kyrie..." `
`"Kyrieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!! `
`............?!?!" `
`"...Oh..." `
`Jessica's fists slammed into the door in slow motion. `
`It was like the decisive scene in a movie was being acted out. `
`However, this was no act. `
`...Jessica's fists really were...slowing down as though they were being sucked in, ...like a spoon sinks through a jar of honey. `
`That punch...was no longer a punch. `
`It was no more than a knock. `
`"I envy you." `
`"......Envy..." `
`"I crawled through the hell of envy for 18 years because of my arrogance and naivety in love. `
`...So I envy you. `
`...You're going to remember my warning, succeed in love, and walk a beautiful life, right...?" `
`"......Hah..." `
`"...Aah, I envy you. `
`You'll get to live through the most beautiful time in a woman's life...for a full 18 years longer than I did. `
`...Aah, I envy you so much...!!" `
`Jessica tried to slam her fists against the door over and over again. `
`However, as soon as her fist approached it, its speed plummeted. `
`She could barely knock, much less smash the door...! `
`"......Speed upgrade. `
`...Instantaneous force upgrade. `
`...Speed of sound upgrade." `
`"It's useless, girl." `
`"...Smash it......!!!!" `
`With full speed upgrades, Jessica's fist moved at the speed of sound, 1225 kilometers per hour. `
`However, how long had Jessica been in envy to gain that speed? `
`She had started to envy George and Shannon's relationship about two years ago? `
`2x365=730 days, `
`730x24=17520 hours. `
`However, she wasn't envious all the time. `
`It only happened when Shannon started going on about George. `
`With Shannon's shift on about 3 days of the week, ÷7x3 ` `
`And it wasn't as though she would go on about George all day long. `
`Her fond words for him would only leave a mark on Jessica for about an hour, right? `
`So only one 24th of each day. `
`17520÷7x3÷24=312 (removing the fractional part).`
`The number of hours that Kyrie had been jealous was 157680. `
`In other words, this wasn't even 0.2% of the time Kyrie had been jealous. `
`Even 1225 kilometers per hour, the speed of sound, becomes only 2.45 kilometers per hour in the 1/500 world. `
`"...Understand? `
`...You're lacking in both love and jealousy." `
`"......!!!" `
`Even if she increased the speed of her fist, `
`...in Kyrie's world, Jessica couldn't make it any faster than a walking child. `
`Jessica ground her teeth, her fist still pressed against the door. `
`If someone could have seen this from both sides of the door, it would have looked as though Kyrie was holding it shut with a single finger... `
`"Way to go, Kyrie...!!!" `
`"See? This room is a closed room. `
`At most, Jessica-chan can knock on the door, but she can't lay a finger on us inside!" `
`"Ah, {f:5:Beatrice}'s definition of a closed room." `
`"......What the heck is that...?" `
`"At this rate, this closed room will be troublesome indeed. `
`It is impossible for a Human to carry out a closed room murder. `
`...Only magic can do that. `
`...Until you truly understand magic, you will not be able to crush it." `
`"Jessica-chan can't corner me any further...! `
`As time passes, the relatives will eventually realize that I haven't returned, and they'll start searching the mansion. `
`Then, you will be observed. `
`Both witches and magic disappear when they're observed. `
`...The nightmare is already over, girl!!!" `
`"...D-Damn...it......" `
`"Ooh?! `
`I can't believe that Jessica's suddenly getting eliminated!!" `
`"Oh, please give it your all! `
`Do it for your beloved Kanon!!" `
`""Come, Jessica, believe in love and show us a miracle!!"" `
`"I revise that. `
`There isn't even any need to wait for time to pass. `
`...After all, there's an internal phone line right here. `
`Of course, the line hasn't been cut. `
`...I'll just... `
`pick up this receiver!! `
`This is...my... `
`checkmate!!!" `
`"......Construction completed. `
`......Closed room murder." `
`"...My, my. `
`...I do believe that's valid." `
`"......Permeation upgrade. `
`......Attack transmission, `
`indirect attack power upgrade." `
`"Huh......?" `
`Jessica's fist, which was pressed against the door, glowed red...and then white-hot... `
`Jessica didn't even swing her fist. `
`She just kept it pressed against the door. `
`However, ...Jessica's "murder" extended within the "closed room"... `
`Through the crack in the door, through the keyhole, ...burst the flames of hell. `
`Jessica couldn't see what was happening inside the room. `
`...However, even here, on the other side of the door, she could tell that the flames of hell had swallowed the entire room. `
`"Ggh... `
`......gyah... `
`...gah... `
`......" `
`Kyrie's smoldering death throes could be heard from across the door. `
`Jessica clearly heard as Kyrie danced a dance of death amidst the hellfire, `
`...fell to her knees, `
`...and slumped over to the floor. `
`Slowly, ...Jessica tore her burning fist away from the door. `
`"......If you love the hell of envy so much, `
`then burn. `
`...Burn in the flames of envy...for all time. `
`......There are probably some things that can be learned from envy. `
`However, it's nothing to be praised, and going through it is no one's duty. `
`......It seems you were too proud after all, `
`...Aunt Kyrie." `
`"...A splendid...closed room murder." `
`"I'll let you take care of the mess. `
`......I'd hate for her corpse to be burnt to a crisp when it's finally found. `
`...Do you think you could clean it up...?" `
`"As you wish, Milady." `
`Ronove transformed into a gold butterfly and entered Krauss's study through the keyhole. `
`...Then, he had to cross his arms and think... `
`about how he should even start cleaning up Kyrie's unrecognizable corpse and this room that had ended up as a burning hell... `
`"......... `
`...Haaah......haah..." `
`Jessica finally let out the breath that she had been holding down in her chest... `
`Her normal Human glint finally returned to her eyes... `
`...And then, ...she couldn't help but shudder at what she'd done, `
`...even if it had been just a trial on the game board for the sake of her love... `
`"...Is that good enough, demons?!" `
`""Yes, well done, Jessica! `
`Your love is the real deal!!"" `
`"........." `
`George welcomed Jessica with a crisp applause. `
`...Beato timidly tried to join him, but Jessica yelled at her and she stopped. `
`"...It's just something that happened on the game board. `
`There's no need to look so sad about it." `
`"I know that logically!! `
`But still, ...how am I supposed to just accept it emotionally?!!" `
`"...Milady-" `
`"Kanon-kun, ...I...love you...! `
`I can't give up...!! `
`That's why I've shown you how I feel...! `
`I...didn't do something wrong, did I? `
`I'm not wrong, am I?! `
`Uuu...aaaaaaaaahhhhhh..." `
`"......Milady..." `
`As Jessica started to sob, ...Kanon held her quietly. `
`And, he realized that he would have to carry on the determination she had shown him... `
`"You didn't make any mistakes. `
`...And it also isn't a mistake to keep your human heart and be sad. `
`...I just happen to be a bit more of a stoic when it comes to that sort of thing." `
`"...Not everyone can match up to George-sama's level. `
`...But, in any event, you have completed your trial, Milady. `
`...Well done. I admire the strength of your determination." `
`"Hmm, I see. `
`Both George and Jessica `
`have splendidly succeeded just the same. `
`Very impressive, Jessica! `
`...That "closed room murder" just now was wonderful enough to fascinate even a witch like myself." `
`Jessica had used "magic" to kill Kyrie, who had holed up inside a closed room. `
`In that instant, Jessica had "constructed" a closed room murder, `
`had it acknowledged by the demons, and raised it to the level of magic... `
`"Your two trials have been completed!!" `
`"So then, who will take the next challenge?!" `
`"Will it be {f:5:Beatrice}-sama?!" `
`"No, no, it might be Shannon!" `
`"No, this has to be Kanon's time to shine!" `
`""Come, speak up!! `
`Who is next?! Who will take the next trial?!"" `
`"......Nn-" `
`"What witch would hesitate at committing murder on the game board? `
`Even shyness can kill love." `
`"........." `
`"All right!! Who will-" `
`"Carry out the next murder of love?!" `
`"........." `
`".........!" `
`"......Nn-" `
`The three who remained looked at each other. `
`...If none of the others raised their hands in the next few seconds, they would raise their own hand. `
`...All three thought this at the same time. `
`So, `
`they all raised their hands at the same time. `
`...The ones they loved had already shown their determination. `
`They had to carry on. `
