`The entrance to the mansion was locked, but Erika had a master key, so she opened it without any trouble. `
`She had gotten Krauss and the others to take the master keys from the servants, `
`and at that time, she had used a little sleight of hand to pilfer one of them... `
`"Well {f:5:then}. `
`Where shall we go {f:5:first}?" `
`"Why ask? `
`...Let's go and hear Battler-san's answer." `
`Grinning, Erika cut across the entrance hall and passed in front of the dining hall, ...deeper, ...deeper. `
`...She headed for the guest room Battler had lain dead in. `
`Battler could put off deciding whether the seals would remain whole or not until the moment right before Erika witnessed them. `
`However, once she did witness them, ...the Game Master would have to show what had happened to them. `
`In the witch's game they were in now, ...the simple act of going to check the seals around the guest room was an attack. `
`"......Are you ready, Lord {f:5:Battler}?" `
`"Yeah. `
`...Or as you'd say it, `
`......come, step forward." `
`"<Good>! `
`Then show us your response. `
`Well now, ...are the seals broken or are they not? `
`Has the closed room been preserved, ...or hasn't it...?!" `
`The piece Erika held high in the air...was the white queen, which represented herself. `
`Her target...was Battler's camp. `
`She attacked! `
`Erika dashed down the hallway with a sickening smile and clung to the guest room door like a spider. `
`Then, she closely examined the seals she had placed retroactively. `
`"......Heh... `
`...heheheheheheheheeheheheheheehheh! `
`...Are you sure...? `
`......You are sure about this, right, `
`...Battler-saaaaaaan...?!" `
`"...I-Is this okay, Battler-san...?" `
`"...Yeah, I can't back down here. `
`...After all, even if I'm sealed in here, ...there are ways of placing the letter." `
`"But now, Erika will probably enter the guest room. `
`And then, she will observe your corpse. `
`...What are you going to do?! `
`If the corpse is there, then there's no problem. `
`...The letter's prediction will be off, but it's not as though there's a penalty for that. `
`...But still, ...you intend to fight head on...!" `
`"There are times, `
`...when a man is challenged head on, ...that he has to respond, no matter who the opponent. `
`...I must not...pull back here. `
`...I'll take that challenge. `
`I can search for a way out all I want to later...! `
`I managed to do that with Kinzo's study last time...! `
`...Don't worry, ...I can do it...! I can do it!! `
`Come on, Erikaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!" `
`"{p:1:We have confirmed that the seals to the guest room are {f:5:undamaged}. `
`Since the time Lady {f:5:Erika} confirmed Battler's presence, this closed room has been {f:5:preserved}.}" `
`"<Good>!! `
`I'm breaking the seals!! `
`Rip, tear!! `
`Heh, hehihihihihihihihihihihi!!!" `
`Erika destroyed the packing tape seal on the door in ecstasy... `
`It looked as though the intellectual rapist had finally laid her true nature bare. `
`"...Okay, `
`...I'm opening it... `
`Let's have a look... `
`...at Battler-san's... `
`...naked scenario...!! `
`Hehihihahahaahaaaaaaaaahhh!!!" `
`Like a ruffian pushing down a frail girl, `
`...Erika mercilessly and greedily threw the door open. `
`Then, finally, ...the inside of Battler's guest room was observed by Erika. `
`Battler had to show it. `
`......Was there a corpse, or wasn't there? `
`"<Come ooooooooooooooon>, Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!!" `
`"Aaaaaaaaaaahhh, here's my respooooooonse!!" `
`Battler grabbed a black piece from the board and raised it high. `
`...Aah, ...that piece... `
`Beato had no memories of the time she had been an expert at this game. `
`And yet, ...for some reason, she realized that this was a move that could not be taken back. `
`Once this piece was moved, they couldn't move it back...!! `
`Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!! `
`...The guest room was covered by a silent darkness. `
`It was pitch black, and nothing could be seen. `
`...However, there was a light switch just off to the side of the entrance. `
`If she flicked that, the room would be lit up, and she would see whether or not there was a corpse on the bed. `
`"......Shall I turn them {f:5:on}?" `
`"No, ...wait a second please. `
`...Battler-san, I have a proposal." `
`"Let's hear it." `
`"I think you already know, `
`...but this time around, I'm not aiming to find the culprit and achieve a standard victory. `
`...My enemy is not the lowly culprit killing the pieces, ...but my opponent, you yourself." `
`"......I know. `
`...So, ...you're after a logic error." `
`"Heheh..." `
`"...I'm seriously regretting it now. `
`...Even though you were just pretending to be miserable, I fell for it completely...and gave you a ridiculous ability." `
`"......That was your {f:5:pride}. `
`...It will cost you {f:5:dearly}." `
`"......Damn...it..." `
`"...So, ...what is your proposal?" `
`With a firm voice, Beato urged her to continue. `
`Until just a second ago, she had remained behind Battler's back, a bit flustered. `
`...However, she was steady now. `
`...She saw that Battler had let his emotions take control of him and had been lured into making a bad move... `
`...and realized that it was time for her to stay cool and support him. `
`Erika's proposal couldn't be anything good. `
`And on top of that, Erika was sly. `
`She probably wouldn't make a proposal that would be easily rejected... `
`"I will now turn on the light. `
`The top of the bed will be lit up, and it will be decided whether or not Battler has disappeared as the letter predicted. `
`...If he's there, great. `
`There's nothing strange at all. `
`The letter's prediction would just be wrong. `
`...Of course, the argument would probably switch over to "Then who put the letter there?", `
`but for the time being, the location of the fight would move outside this closed room." `
`"......And...if he's missing...?" `
`Beato already knew. `
`She knew the move that Battler had made a second ago. `
`...Battler had...already disappeared from this room... `
`Therefore, they would need to prepare a disappearing trick other than `
`"He was actually alive and left through the door". `
`The situation is simple. `
`First, this room is a closed room. `
`Also, Battler's life or death status hasn't been confirmed. `
`In other words, him being alive wouldn't cause any problems. `
`They "had to make Erika think" that Battler had vanished from this situation. `
`He just had to escape from the room, `
`...or if that wasn't possible, he just had to hide somehow and wait for her to leave, making her think that he'd disappeared. `
`"Inside this tiny room, `
`...I will now begin our endgame, `
`...the chase after the king. `
`It should end in just a few moves. `
`You'll be unable to construct the logic needed to let Battler escape from this room, `
`......and the tale will be destroyed--game over." `
`"......Fighting to keep that from happening is our job. `
`...What is this proposal of yours?" `
`"An endgame fought over a logic error should be a bit more precise. `
`...Once again, we will fight with the red and blue truths, `
`but we need a referee on the same level as the Game Master to observe and see that he doesn't create any logic errors with the red truth." `
`"...Th-That seems reasonable." `
`"There's nothing special about this. `
`...Back when the old you was the Game Master, `
`you were under the observation of your guardian, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}. `
`In that way, it was judged that all red truths were valid." `
`"...So, you're telling us to show {f:5:Lambdadelta} our cards?" `
`"I've been watching since the beginning. `
`...It's okay, don't worry. `
`I am impartial in my judgments." `
`"C-Can you say that in red...?" `
`"Yep. `
`{p:1:I swear that I am impartial in my judgments.} `
`......I was plenty impartial in the last game, wasn't I?" `
`"...Especially for interesting judgments where she doesn't care which way it falls. `
`......Accept it, Battler. `
`Erika is going to corner you. `
`Understand? `
`......She will duel with you and kill you in this room. `
`...If you're a man, accept the duel...!" `
`"...S-Sure, fine. `
`......We won't get anywhere if you suspect every single impossible murder I show of being a logic error. `
`...It's true that we need an observer to guarantee that the game is legitimate." `
`"Then I'll come around to your side. `
`...Let me take a look at your hand. `
`......Hmmmmm...?" `
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} understood what Battler had up his sleeve. `
`...And she saw that Erika's first move had indeed gone straight through his heart. `
`Just as Erika had guessed, `
`Battler was alive, and had slipped out of the room after Erika had examined his "corpse", `
`...placed the letter by the guesthouse, and hid himself somewhere. `
`When the packing tape seals had been retroactively placed on the guest room, `
`...he would've had to show that they'd been torn. `
`However, if he had done that, it would be the same as admitting that he'd been seen through and that he'd lost. `
`Unwilling to admit that, Battler had claimed that the seals had been maintained, with false courage, `
`and was now rushing to revise his logic. `
`True, he could still escape for a few more moves. `
`...However, Erika was planning to corner and kill him here... `
`"...Battler, `
`...you're fighting with some pretty incredible cards here." `
`"Cards...? `
`...Does this game of chess look like a card game to you?" `
`"...To me, it looks as though you all are playing a game of poker. `
`So, by moving to this side and looking at the cards you hold, I understand everything. `
`......That's an awful move. `
`It's a complete waste... `
`And Erika has already seen right through you." `
`"......Heheh... `
`What would you do?" `
`"I'm the referee. I can't give you advice. `
`...But let me tell you my impressions." `
`"No, that's okay." `
`"...It's chilling. `
`...You're trying to use this useless move... `
`...this baseless bluff... `
`...to make Erika back down... `
`...She's not going to back down, that girl. `
`...After all, ... `
`...you're the one who should be throwing his chips in and folding now..." `
`"...Thanks for the advice. `
`......Battler-san, `
`I agree with her. `
`...Let's back down from the fight in this room. `
`We don't have any winning cards..." `
`"Were you hoping to discard your cards and draw something more useful...? `
`...I thought you were playing chess... `
`In the world of chess, ...if you rely on luck, ...you die..." `
`By "hoping to draw something useful", `
`...she meant relying on luck and betting that, even if he couldn't think of a trick now, `
`he might think of a good plan for making a closed room trick later on. `
`If you enter into the fight... `
`...without any trick in mind, `
`...you get killed...! `
`Now was the time to back down. `
`When Erika flipped the switch, `
`...he just had to be sleeping there on that bed. `
`...That's all...he needs! `
`"...Lambda, `
`I don't know what you're talking about, but you're chatting too much. `
`A referee needs to be impartial." `
`"True... `
`...Then, good luck, Battler. `
`...I'm hoping for a precise, chess-like battle. `
`...You aren't playing poker, ...are you...?" `
`"Are you ready, Battler-san?" `
`"Yeah, I am... `
`...Turn the lights on whenever you want." `
`"For the rest of the fight in this room, the progression of time will be stopped. `
`This way, all the moves for both players will be made at the same time, `
`and the first move made will be treated no differently than the last move. `
`...It might be hard to understand, but this rule exists for the purpose of maintaining logic, `
`and to keep you protected as well." `
`"...From here on out, you can use all the twisted logic you want to rebuild the trick in this room. `
`...In other words, it's possible that you might think of a good idea partway through the fight. `
`...Normally, it's unfair to revise your plot partway through. `
`In order for that to be acceptable, ...you need a world stopped in time, where everything happens at once, `
`...and where logic that you think of afterwards can counter your opponent's earlier moves." `
`"Of course, Erika can take advantage of this rule as well. `
`...If you revise your trick to be a new one, she can deal with that in a different way." `
`"......This is pretty complicated..." `
`"It's simple. `
`...It's like a corrupt politician's war of twisted logic. `
`...You lie shamelessly. `
`When evidence is shown revealing that lie, you retract those previous lies and shamelessly say that you just remembered it wrong, `
`then change to a new lie that doesn't have any contradictions. `
`...The fight goes between a lie, then evidence exposing it, then another lie, `
`...like a fight between two snakes spinning around trying to eat each other's tails." `
`"<Good>! `
`...Just think of it as a world in which you're allowed to use twisted logic based off of your opponents moves as often as you want. `
`...I used that myself when sealing this room. `
`So, I thought it was only fair to let you do the same." `
`"...You have no shame, do you...?" `
`"OK!! `
`Then let's have both sides begin! `
`Will Erika take the first move? `
`Will she start by checking the bed, ...by checking to see what he's bet?!" `
`"Yeah, let's start by checking to see if Battler's on the {i:bed}. `
`...Erika, begin." `
`"Leave it to me, my master! `
`<Light>...<on>!" `
`With a *click*, `
`...the sound of the light switch rang out, `
`...and the bulb turned on, lighting up the room. `
`...On Battler's... `
`...bed... `
`...was... `
`"......Dlanor, `
`confirm it with the red." `
`"{f:5:Yes}. `
`...Ushiromiya Battler-" `
`"No, it's my move. `
`...I'll say it. `
`......{p:1:Ushiromiya Battler is not on the bed.}" `
`"<Good>. `
`......I'm glad you didn't run away from the fight. `
`I'm impressed." `
`"...It's a high-stakes battle, so it'll cost you a lot if you're the one who loses. `
`Are you prepared...?" `
`"*giggle* No one would raise the stakes unless they felt confident in their advantage." `
`"...Dlanor, `
`keep a record." `
`"As you {f:5:wish}." `
`At Dlanor's nod, Cornelia, who was hanging back, started taking a record. `
`She wrote down that Battler's corpse, which should have been on the bed, was not, `
`...and also that Battler hadn't backed down from this closed room game... `
`"As previously announced, Battler's first move is to have the corpse vanish. `
`...Now it's Erika's turn. `
`Go ahead." `
`"...I present the possibility that Ushiromiya Battler is alive and hiding somewhere in this room. `
`I proclaim this with the blue truth." `
`"Invalid. `
`If you want to use the blue truth, give me a specific location." `
`"...Pfft. `
`...In the last game, Beato did that in Kinzo's study, `
`and Dlanor made Swiss cheese of her, right...? `
`Are you trying to take revenge for that? ...*giggle*..." `
`"Before I start searching, I have one blue truth I can use without a search. `
`{p:2:There is a possibility of a hidden door X that is impossible to discover. `
`He's hidden behind that, so it's impossible for me to find him.} `
`"{p:1:Knox's 3rd. `
`It is forbidden for hidden passages to exist.} `
`...Isn't that right?" `
`"... `
`{p:1:No hidden places that are impossible for Erika-san to find exist inside the guest room.}" `
`"Knox's 3rd, ...{f:5:valid}." `
`"<Good>. `
`...Then let's get started with the search." `
`...Erika slowly began to walk around the room... `
`Until the endgame had started, Erika had been energetic, `
`jumping about impatiently like a hungry dog. `
`However, `
`...now that it had actually begun... `
`...This was a stifling battle of wits, `
`...where each breath made her tense... `
`Even the quiet sound of the rain...was distracting... `
`"Now that I've searched the room, let's confirm its layout." `
`"...The guest room is divided into two rooms, the bedroom and the {f:5:bathroom}. `
`Lady {f:5:Erika} has currently searched the entire bedroom {f:5:section}. `
`There is only one {f:5:exception}." `
`"......I'll leave that one place be for the time being. `
`So, were there any irregularities discovered in the bedroom?" `
`"There were {f:5:none}. `
`{p:1:Except for one location, there is no one to be seen in the {f:5:bedroom}}." `
`"...What's this "except for one location" business? `
`Say it without being annoying." `
`"There's a reason a face-down card remains face down. `
`...I'll turn it over if it's needed, so look forward to it. ...*giggle*." `
`After thoroughly checking the bedroom, ...Erika headed for the bathroom door. `
`Since he wasn't in the bedroom, it was natural to think that he was in the bathroom. `
`And, since the guest room was made up of two rooms, if Battler wasn't in the bathroom either, `
`...it would mean that he had managed to vanish from the closed room. `
`...Except for that single location that Erika had intentionally left unchecked... `
`"I'm checking the bathroom." `
`"...Lady {f:5:Erika}, `
`...the sound of water can be heard from {f:5:inside}. `
`Also, there is a faint {f:5:heat}." `
`"Ooh...? `
`...Don't tell me he's taking a shower... `
`Is it locked or something...?" `
`"No, it isn't locked. `
`Go ahead and open it." `
`"...Then, if you'll allow me." `
`Slowly, ...Erika put her hand on the doorknob on the bathroom door... `
`...She tried to push it open, but felt a strange resistance. `
`Of course, it wasn't the resistance of the lock. `
`...It felt...as though it had an unnatural load on it... `
`Out from the slightly open crack poured the hot air from the shower. `
`However, it was unlocked, so there probably wasn't anyone taking a shower. `
`After letting a dumbfounded expression rise to her face, Erika slammed into the door with her whole body, knocking it open... `
`"Hyaa?! `
`Wh-What?!?!" `
`As soon as she opened the door, a hot blast poured out on her. `
`Erika froze, unable to understand what had happened. `
`After falling backwards on her butt, she realized that boiling hot shower water was spewing out at her, and hard. `
`"...Wh- `
`What is this...? `
`...What a crazy...prank..." `
`Cursing, Erika wrapped the blanket from the bed around herself, and tried to enter the bathroom once more. `
`This time, she was able to figure out what was going on. `
`It was...quite an elaborate prank. `
`A wire fixed the shower nozzle in place so that it pointed at the entrance. `
`The pressure and heat were turned up to the max, `
`so that anyone who went through the door would be met with a wave of hot water. `
`The pressure was very strong, which probably accounted for the weight she had felt when trying to push the door open. `
`She tried to make the nozzle point in another direction, `
`but not only was it fixed in place by the wire, `
`it was also fixed in a place high enough that Erika couldn't reach it with her height. `
`She tried to turn off the pressure, but that was also held in place by wires. `
`She couldn't manage anything with her bare hands. `
`She would have to get a tool that could cut the wires. `
`However, when she looked into the bathtub, which was overflowing with very hot water, `
`she saw a bundle of wires and some nippers that had been used to cut them lying at the bottom. `
`If she used that, she could turn off the pressure... `
`"...Ah, owowowowowowow!! `
`...Damn you...!!" `
`The blanket she had used to protect herself from the shower was getting more and more drenched with boiling hot water. `
`At this rate, she'd get burns even through the blanket. `
`She needed to turn the water off quickly...! `
`Right next to the bathtub, she saw a hanging long-handled body brush. `
`...Perfect...! `
`Erika used that to skillfully scrape the nippers up off the bottom of the tub. `
`Fortunately, it was a shallow Western-style bathtub. `
`If it had been a deep Japanese one, it would probably have burned her badly. `
`Making sure not to touch the hot metal parts, she carefully took the nippers... `
`...and cut the wires around the faucet... `
`...Take that, ...and that...! `
`"*pant*, ...*pant*! `
`*pant*...*pant*!!" `
`She finally managed to turn the hot water faucet, and the heat from the hot water storm died down. `
`...For a while, Erika was forced to cool her almost burnt arms under running water... `
`"...What a {f:5:calamity}." `
`"Would you like a bath? `
`I can wash your face with this brush." `
`"I appreciate the sentiment, but {f:5:no}." `
`"Oh. ...That's a {f:5:shame}." `
`Erika had finally regained enough of her composure to be abusive... `
`She turned off the faucet completely, ...and silence returned to the bathroom. `
`After that, all that remained was Erika's heavy breathing. `
`She turned on the fan to get rid of the hot steam. `
`She had to leave the bathroom until that was finished. `
`...It was pleasant, like stepping into an air-conditioned room on a hot summer's day. `
`"...Now that was a ridiculous trap. `
`...However, that wasn't here at the time I examined Battler's "corpse". `
`Therefore, the appearance of this trap proves that Ushiromiya Battler was alive. `
`...Well, I never thought he was dead anyway." `
`"...So he decided to openly show a card that had already been {f:5:exposed}." `
`"Let's check the inside of the bathroom. `
`Was Battler seen?" `
`"{f:5:No}. `
`{p:1:No one was seen in the {f:5:bathroom}}." `
`"<Good>. `
`Now we've confirmed that, `
`{p:1:except for one location, Battler does not exist anywhere inside the guest room.}" `
`"...Give that a rest. `
`Just where is this one exception?" `
`"A coffin. `
`......Ushiromiya Battler's coffin, that is." `
`"...Ashes to ashes, the dead to their {f:5:coffins}." `
`"......You plan to trap me in this room, right? `
`...Okay. `
`Let's have it." `
`A silence that was complete except for the rain...was suddenly filled with the smell of gunpowder. `
`Though it was extremely quiet, `
`...the room was filled with tension, ...as though you'd be sliced in half if you relaxed for an instant. `
`A cloud of gold butterflies gathered on the room's round table...and turned into a witch's chessboard. `
`It was finally...time for her attack. `
`"Blue truth. `
`{p:2:You did not vanish from this room. `
`You just hid yourself to make it seem as though you'd disappeared from a closed room. `
`The place you are hiding...is the "one exception" that I haven't investigated yet.}" `
`As Erika lightly raised her right hand, ... `
`a single gold butterfly appeared from the darkness behind her, `
`...flitted between the index finger and middle finger of Erika's raised hand, and became a white piece. `
`Then, ......she lifted it high into the air... `
`"{p:2:This is the one exception. `
`...The walk-in closet next to the entrance!!}" `
`*bang*!! `
`...Like a falling white lightning bolt, `
`...the white piece `
`hit the board, `
`...landing by a weak spot in Battler's formation... `
`"Yes, it is {f:5:here}...!!!" `
`With a crash, the door of the closet, which was just off to the side of the guest room's entrance, was impaled by a spear that represented the blue truth. `
`Dlanor had spun around and thrown it. `
`The door was completely pierced, `
`...and the spear stuck in so deeply that if a human had been hiding in it, it would have pierced their chest as well. `
`...Its still quivering handle was a testament to the force with which it had been thrown. `
`"........." `
`"{p:2:There are no places in which to hide other than {f:5:this}. `
`You are now hiding in {f:5:here}}." `
`"......What do you say, Battler-san...? `
`Have you been struck through the chest `
`for a literal Smothered Mate...?" `
`"........." `
`"...Battler-san, `
`...it's our move now." `
`"Yeah. `
`...I thought it'd be like that, Erika. `
`You intentionally left one spot open so you could stuff me into that coffin. `
`...It's the same move that trapped Kinzo in Natsuhi's room. `
`...I saw it coming." `
`"Oh, ...did you? `
`...Then let's see your response. `
`...But let me make a prediction." `
`"Let's hear it." `
`"...I'll checkmate you two moves from now. `
`That's my prediction." `
`"Then I'll make the same prediction. `
`...I'll checkmate you in two moves." `
`"......Sounds interesting." `
`"...These predictions contradict each other. `
`......Who will be the liar, I wonder...?" `
`The air burst and sparked. `
`...The silence would hurt one's skin. `
`"Then {f:5:go}. `
`...It is your {f:5:turn}." `
`"...It's useless. `
`Your lowly coffin won't be able to trap Battler-san." `
`"Here's my response." `
`Slowly, `
`...Battler moved his hand over the chessboard. `
`A gold butterfly that had appeared from the darkness rested on Battler's finger and became a black piece. `
`...That black piece was the king, ...which represented Battler. `
`"......This is my response... `
`to your "{p:2:Battler is hiding in the closet}"... `
`...Take this." `
`"{p:1:Ushiromiya Battler does not exist within the guest room. `
`...There are no exceptions, including the closet.}" `
`Like a black bolt of lightning this time, `
`...Battler slammed his piece down on the white piece of Erika's that had cut deep behind his lines, ...crushing hers. `
`It scattered like a golden spray and melted beautifully into the darkness `
`as a faint cloud of gold sparks drifted about... `
`"...I see, so he hid in the closet at first, `
`...and then slipped out of the room while Erika was occupied by the shower!" `
`"It's the same technique he used to let Kinzo escape from the study in the last game. `
`Distract the observation of the observer, and disappear into the darkness." `
`"...<Good>. `
`Of course. Yes, of course. `
`...I'd already foreseen that move." `
`Next was Erika's turn. `
`...A gold butterfly popped into existence in front of Erika, `
`...and she grabbed it right out of the air. `
`She then lifted that hand into the air...and raised the white piece high. `
`"Let me announce a retroactive move. `
`This occurs back in the very beginning, right after I broke the seals and entered this room. `
`... `
`{p:1:At that time, I immediately closed the door, reset the chain, and sealed this room.}" `
`"Objection. `
`{p:2:Gohda severed the chain back when the crime was first discovered. `
`Since the chain lock is not functioning, it is impossible to use it to create a seal.}" `
`"Objection overruled. `
`{p:1:Erika repaired the chain lock.} `
`...See?" `
`"...Impossible. `
`...How could she have repaired a brass chain?" `
`"It was possible. `
`...Have you forgotten, Beato? `
`The packing tape seals. `
`... `
`{p:1:Erika used that packing tape to join the two cut ends of the chain together, "sealing" them. `
`In other words, the chain was repaired by the packing tape, and this room once again became a closed room locked from the inside.}" `
`"O-Objection. `
`Erika-san has already used up her packing tape seals, hasn't she...?! `
`She shouldn't be able to use them anymore...!" `
`"Objection overruled. `
`{p:1:The use of the packing tape wasn't limited by the number of strips, right? `
`It was by the number of rooms. `
`...The only restriction was to limit it to only three rooms. `
`...Erika chose this guest room to be one of those rooms. `
`So, Erika has the right to seal as many places as many times as she wants within this room.}" `
`"...Gah......" `
`"...That's right. `
`...I...gave her permission to do that." `
`"This is the cost of your {f:5:pride}. `
`...Sympathy is the evil liquor that the proud are most fond {f:5:of}." `
`"So, `
`with this retroactive move, `
`{p:1:I proclaim that the chain lock has been repaired by the packing tape seal and has regained its original functionality. `
`And, thanks to that, I locked the room upon entering it and made this guest room a closed room from the inside once more.}" `
`The white piece Erika held aloft...represented the seal caused by the chain lock. `
`This move would draw out Battler's king and drag it to the guillotine. `
`"Die, Battler." `
`The piece for the chain lock was slammed down right at Battler's king's throat. `
`"Repeat it. `
`"The lock created by the chain is currently intact"." `
`".........!" `
`Battler's face contorted. `
`...Beato, who was watching from behind, grimaced even more. `
`This move...was very painful. `
`If his logic had him hiding in the closet until Erika left, `
`using the uproar in the bathroom to escape, `
`...then the chain lock must have been undone. `
`In other words, he couldn't respond to her demand. `
`If he didn't respond, Erika would use the blue truth in her next move. `
`She would probably say 'you hid in the closet, then used the disturbance in the bathroom to escape. `
`Since you then couldn't set the chain lock from the outside, you left it undone'... `
`And she would be right. `
`...This was...checkmate. `
`As Erika had predicted, she would strike the finishing blow on the second move. `
`...And on top of that, she would probably use the disappearing Battler `
`to solve most of the crimes that were to follow. `
`...Losing the battle in this closed room would steal a major deciding piece from Battler... `
`But what if... `
`......he responded to her demand? `
`What if he could say "the lock created by the chain is still intact"? `
`That...would be fatal to Erika. `
`It had already been shown with the red truth that this guest room could only be made into a closed room from the inside. `
`So, ...this hopeless closed room would instead become Erika's coffin. `
`With a riddle of that magnitude, Erika probably wouldn't solve the mystery of Battler's disappearance before the end. `
`Each unsolved riddle gives an advantage to the witch side. `
`Battler... `
`wanted to respond to this demand if at all possible. `
`However, ...if he responded... `
`If he answered by saying that the chain was still set... `
`...He would have to abandon the logic saying that he had escaped while Erika wasn't looking. `
`Once he escaped, he wouldn't be able to set the chain lock again. `
`It would make a riddle to corner Erika, but he would have to construct a different escape method. `
`Even a move such as him leaving the closet during the scene in the bathroom and hiding in another place--say, under the bed-- `
`wouldn't work because he had proclaimed that "{p:1:Battler does not exist within the guest room}". `
`If he could construct logic that allowed him to escape from here while preserving the chain lock's position, `
`......then Erika would be the one facing a fatal blow. `
`However, ...if he didn't have that logic, ...if he failed, `
`...it would be a logic error. `
`The worst and lowest forbidden move that would instantly end the game in his defeat. `
`He would have no way to recover. `
`......For Battler, ...deciding how to respond to this demand... `
`...was a very advanced and difficult decision... `
`Either way, ...Erika would probably corner him. `
`"...In that case, ...my choice is obvious." `
`"...B-Battler-san, `
`...this guest room has already been restricted in many ways by the red truth due to its closed room nature. `
`...How do you plan on escaping from this...?!" `
`"......If only I could do something about the chain lock... `
`...If only..." `
`If he could somehow get around the chain lock, `
`...he could force Erika to deal with a terrible closed room! `
`It would probably end up as a finishing blow to her. `
`But in order to do that, he would need to make a trick for escaping `
`"the closed room that existed before Erika came back", `
`which was now "the closed room sealed by the chain that Erika set right after entering the room", `
`and on top of that, he had to make sure that "the chain that could only be set from the inside remained in place"...! `
`If he could do that, if he could find a way, `
`...then it would end here...! `
`But I still can't think of that trick...! `
`Right now, Erika is demanding to know whether the chain lock is still set or not. `
`I need to decide whether I'll take that challenge or back down, ...and I need to do it right now...! `
`If I can find a certain-win trick, then this is the end...! `
`But if I don't have that trick, `
`...I should just acknowledge that I slipped out of the closet, undid the chain, and escaped, ...backing out of the fight... `
`If I say the chain was set without a trick up my sleeve, `
`...then it's impossible for me to escape. `
`In other words, it's a logic error...!! `
`"Even if we lose the fight in this room, there will still be chances left to us. `
`We've still only started the second day, haven't we? `
`We have plenty of time to reconstruct an impossible murder." `
`"...No, that's no good. `
`If I acknowledge that I've escaped from this room now, it's the same as acknowledging that I'm the culprit! `
`...If I back down from the fight in this room, ...it's the same as accepting my defeat in this game." `
`Battler's point was a valid one. `
`Since all of the other humans were still locked in the guesthouse, `
`then if Battler alone was alive and free to move... `
`Erika would probably base her explanation for all of the following impossible crimes on the blue truth that Battler was the perpetrator. `
`If they wanted to forcefully turn that around, they would have to rewrite their tricks and logic so that "someone other than Battler" would be set up as the perpetrator. `
`If they fixed up one flaw, it would give rise to new flaws, `
`...which might eventually pile up and kill Battler. `
`Even running away would mean tightening the noose around his own throat. `
`The first truth...that Battler is the culprit...has already been hit upon! `
`And yet, I have to struggle desperately to get out of this...! ...I need to...!! `
`I'm on the edge. `
`I've definitely been cornered in a dangerous spot. `
`However, ...if I can just change my position, everything might turn around at once... `
`If I can just make this chain my weapon, `
`...I can kill Erika...!! `
`"Wait, ...are you actually going to respond to her demand...?! `
`Is there any way to escape without undoing the chain lock?! `
`......There isn't! `
`If you respond, ...you'll lose instantly from the logic error at the end! `
`It's clear which choice we ought to make!" `
`"Yeah, it's clear. `
`......No matter what move we choose, it'll turn for the worst just as Erika wants. `
`...If it's horrible either way, `
`...I'd like to choose the move that has the biggest reward if we win...!" `
`"......You're going to call, even though you have no logic for escaping and no trump cards? `
`...You think you can accept her demand and win...?!" `
`"My cards might be useless. `
`...However, ...with just one more card, they might become a straight, a flush, `
`...or even a royal flush. `
`......If hell waits for me after both options, `
`...I'll take the one that'll finish her off if I win...!" `
`"...Th-That's an insane move. `
`...Sometimes, madmen leap into the path of death, `
`......and so miracles occur..." `
`"It's impossible!! `
`...H-How could you escape this closed room without removing the chain?!!" `
`"...There's only one difference between heroes and madmen. `
`...It's whether they win or lose. `
`......I'll be looking forward...to your big victory..." `
`If I can finish things with this move, ......then as I predicted, `
`...I can kill Erika on my second move. `
`I still can't think of a trick for escaping this closed room. `
`However, ...there has to be something, ...there has to... `
`Once I think of that, ...I can make a magic illusion of me changing into a butterfly `
`and slipping out of the crack in the door like smoke... `
`...If I have even a drop of that mad magician's blood in my veins, `
`......please let that honor... `
`...give me just a fragment of a miracle right now...! `
`"...So, Battler-san? `
`Let's have that second move that you predicted you'd checkmate me on." `
`"Please give an answer to Lady {f:5:Erika}'s {f:5:demand}. `
`...Will you respond, ...or will you {f:5:refuse}...?!" `
`Slowly, `
`...Battler's hand stretched out to his king piece on the board. `
`He lifted it up... `
`...and slowly... `
`...held it aloft, `
`...tracing a large circle in the sky... `
`Would Battler respond, ...or wouldn't he? `
`Would the lock caused by the chain be preserved, or wouldn't it? `
`...Would Battler's king crush the piece of the chain lock that stood right in front of it...? `
`...Or would it slip away like a ghost...and escape...? `
`"This is...my response. `
`...As predicted, ...on this second turn of mine, `
`...you're through. `
`......Here it comes. `
`...Furudo... `
`...Erika...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!" `
`Battler's king had become a black lightning bolt that crashed down onto the board... `
`Where had it gone?! `
`On top of the piece of the chain lock? `
`Or past that piece...? `
`"......I will repeat it. `
`{p:1:The lock caused by the chain is intact.}" `
`Battler's king... `
`...had left the chain lock piece in its place... `
`...and had `
`{i:slipped past it}... `
`"Heh, ...heheheheheheheh... `
`...Yeah, it sure would be cool if you could say that the chain lock was still set, wouldn't it...? `
`Don't you think that'd be cool...? `
`...But do you know what they call a fool `
`who's full of himself and jumps into the path of death just because it's cool...?" `
`"...No clue..." `
`"Ushiromiya...Battler. `
`... `
`... `
`... `
`... `
`... `
`That's `
`what `
`we `
`call `
`them `
`aaaahhaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh, `
`I file a motion for a logic error!!" `
`"That red truth of yours just now has cut off your own logic!! `
`Please have the impartial referee make her judgment immediately!! `
`Great Lady {f:5:Lambdadeltaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa}!!!" `
`"Motion received. `
`...{f:5:Lambdadelta}, `
`does this make logical sense? Your inspection please." `
`"Motion received. `
`......Battler, `
`......show me. `
`Let me see...your cards......" `
`"......Battler...san......" `
`"...It is a royal flush, `
`right...? `
`If you've got nothing, `
`...you won't get out of this with just a "sorry", okay...?" `
`"...... `
`...Yeah. `
`I have no intention of apologizing." `
`"...If it's a logic error, the game board will be blown away. `
`...You've inherited this game board from Beato. `
`......It's the one thing you have left `
`of that precious Beato. `
`So, you must not allow for a logic error." `
`A logic error only becomes established when the witch admits to it. `
`As long as they can keep thinking of new logic to escape with, ...they will not die, cannot die. `
`However, ...that would be like living in an endless living hell of the mind. `
`"...Even if you manage to crawl around forever after falling onto the darkness of thought, `
`...you'll just be eternally trapped in a hell where you constantly think of ways to escape that closed room, while refusing to accept your logic error. `
`...Are you sure?! Are you sure?! `
`This is nearly as bad as the depths of oblivion, got it?!?! `
`It's like the difference between falling from the roof of a ten-story building and falling from the roof of a hundred-story building!!" `
`"......Lambda, `
`Battler has already finished making his move. `
`Players can't take back a move once it's made. `
`...Act as an impartial judge, carry out our motion, `
`and see whether or not Battler's escape from the closed room is logical, ...and whether there has been a logic error or not." `
`"Be slow, accurate, and meticulous like an archaeologist. `
`...And, be as fast as a guy at an ice cream shop when he forcefully and skillfully scoops out that sweet, fragrant vanilla/soy sauce ice cream!!!" `
`"Y-Yes, I know that. `
`......Battler, `
`...let me see it." `
`"......Battler-san..." `
`"Beato, ...do you think I'll lose?" `
`"...I don't want to think that. `
`...After fighting with the old me many times, `
`...you finally reached the miracle that I so wanted you to find. `
`...So, ...I'd like to believe... `
`......that you'll win through a miracle once again...!" `
`"......This woman called {f:5:Beatrice}... `
`...The whole time, `
`...she fought on this same border between reason and madness. `
`...She fought with a mixture of sadness, anger, and several other emotions for me that can't be described with words. `
`......And in the very last game, `
`...at the very last moment, `
`...she managed... `
`...to seize victory." `
`That might...have been the purpose of the card Beato had been gripping as she fell. `
`Beato passed away... `
`...without realizing `
`that she had won. `
`In the final game, `
`...the true victor... `
`was Beato... `
`"That Beato...entrusted me with this game board. `
`...So, I'll win. `
`...So, I need at least you to believe in me, `
`...{f:5:Beatrice}...!" `
`"If I believe, ...and a miracle occurs..." `
`"......Please." `
`"I do believe in you...!! `
`Battler-san...!!!" `
`"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh, this is pissing me ooooooooooooff!!! `
`Please just check it already, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}!! `
`There is no valid logic! `
`There doesn't exist any way to get out of this closed room!! `
`You were overeager, Battler-san! `
`If you could win with this, that'd be cool!" `
`"If you just vanished even though the chain is still set, that'd make you so awesome, so cool, so mysterious, hold me!! `
`Kyaaaaaaaaaaaahhahhaaaaaaaaahhh!! `
`Like hell you caaaaaaaaaaaannn!! `
`Like hell you can do iiiiiiiit!! `
`If you could do that, you really would be a witch! `
`If you could vanish your way out of this closed room like a puff of smoke, I'd have to acknowledge it! `
`It'd be the work of a wiiiiiiiitch!!!" `
`"Quiet, Lady {f:5:Erika}! `
`...Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} is conducting her {f:5:inspection}." `
`"......... `
`......Pass through, one move. `
`...Go back, `
`...and corner." `
`With sweat gathering on her forehead, ...{f:5:Lambdadelta} inspected the movements of the pieces from Battler's side. `
`She was as accurate and meticulous as an archaeologist, ...just as {f:5:Bernkastel} had told her to be. `
`"........." `
`After gulping stiffly, `
`...Lambda looked several times between the formation of the pieces on the board... `
`...and Battler's face, `
`which remained tense but steady. `
`"...Lambda......?" `
`"......I have... `
`...finished my inspection..." `
`"There's no way the logic works...!" `
`"......Please...God..." `
`"........." `
`"......Erika." `
`"What...?" `
`"I'm so sorry." `
`"...Wh-Which way am I supposed to take that...?!!" `
`"It was fun. `
`...Now, this is the end." `
`"I told you, ...which way am I supposed to take thaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!!" `
`"Silence!! `
`I have finished inspecting Battler's move. `
`......My decision is that-" `
`{a:c: `
`"...It's valid."} `
`"Va...lid......?" `
`"...You're lying...!!" `
`"I judge it to be valid. `
`...He's presented logic that doesn't violate any of the red truths, and I've finished checking it. `
`...The move by the player on the witch side, along with that final red truth he repeated, are valid. `
`......Battler, `
`for the first time, ...I've got to say I think you're incredible..." `
`"......See? `
`...In your game, ...a miracle will always occur if you believe." `
`"B-Battler...san...!! `
`I-I'm sorry...!! `
`If only I had believed more strongly, ...you wouldn't have been cornered like this...!! Waaaaaaaahh!!" `
`Beato flew onto Battler's chest, sobbing... `
`Erika staggered backwards, ...shaking her head back and forth dizzily. `
`And {f:5:Bernkastel}...? `
`......Her face was like an expressionless mask. `
`Then, ...slowly, `
`...it became a smile... `
`And for some reason, `
`...it seemed the sign of some horrible emotion... `
`"Well...{f:5:done}... `
`...To think... `
`...that you escaped the room... `
`...without removing the {f:5:chain}... `
`...Simply {f:5:splendid}..." `
`With her small hands, Dlanor slowly started to applaud quietly. `
`...She was followed by Gertrude, and then Cornelia. `
`...And then by Beato and {f:5:Lambdadelta} too. `
`......Applause...filled the room... `
`"...O-Onii-chan... `
`...H-How did you..." `
`"...I see. `
`...Yes, a move that cannot be seen by one whose thoughts are trapped within the closed room..." `
`"Impossible, `
`...im... `
`possible... `
`...Eee... `
`eeeeeeeeek...!" `
`As {f:5:Lambdadelta} watched Erika, who was breathing hard, shocked and dizzy with a despair she couldn't accept, `
`...she had to take her hat off to the swiftness of Battler's heart and intellect... `
`and to the power of this miracle. `
`...Incredible, ...Ushiromiya Battler. `
`It's my complete loss for thinking that your power and Beato's would cancel each other out and bring an eternal draw. `
`And...Bern, who thought everything would move according to her plan, `
`even though she already knew your true strength, `
`...has also suffered a complete loss. `
`Bern is the witch who waits for miracles. `
`You are the witch who summons miracles. `
`...You... `
`...are not Bern's piece. `
`...Just now, `
`...without a doubt, `
`...you have surpassed Bern... `
`...You really did, `
`...in this one moment, `
`...think up a trick by which to escape from this closed room...! `
`As Erika had predicted, ...Battler had been hiding in the closet. `
`Then, during the disturbance in the bathroom, he had snuck out of the door. `
`...Erika had guessed this much. `
`That's why they retroactively set the chain lock and sealed it to prevent Battler from doing this very thing. `
`The chain lock cannot be reset from the outside. `
`So, it should have been impossible to escape from the closed room. `
`However, ...Battler didn't let his thinking get trapped inside this closed room, `
`...and so, he broke through. `
`...It doesn't matter who, ...but let's explain it with his mother, Kyrie's piece. `
`Just like Battler, the life or death status of the rest of the first twilight victims has not been specified by the red truth. `
`In other words, ...just like Battler, `
`...the others, and Kyrie specifically, can still move. `
`And their closed rooms were not sealed, so they can go out as they please. `
`...Kyrie...had come to save him. `
`Kyrie followed behind Erika...and waited in the hallway while the latter entered the guest room and sealed the door from the inside. `
`...Then, after Battler undid the chain lock and escaped, `
`......she entered the room in his place... `
`Then, ...Kyrie reset the chain lock from the inside, `
`...and hid in the closet, ...just like Battler had done... `
`Yes. `
`...Battler truly isn't inside this guest room right now. `
`However, that doesn't mean that no one else is inside it. `
`...Kyrie took Battler's place in the closet, `
`...the one exception that Erika had left, and is there still... `
`Kyrie... `
`......saved......Battler............ `
`{a:c: `
`{p:1: `
`Ushiromiya Kyrie `
`{f:5:cannot save} Battler `
`}.} `
`............Huh.........? `
`"Wh‐......what do you mean......?" `
`"...... `
`{p:1:Ushiromiya Kyrie......cannot save Battler}." `
`"...Wh‐......why not?! `
`There's no red saying that Kyrie can't save Battler! `
`Wait a second, ...how are you using the red truth?!" `
`"Valid. `
`......Dlanor's red truth is valid." `
`"Requesting permission to unsheathe red key." `
`"......Permission granted. `
`Please do it, Dlanor." `
`"...H-How...? `
`...How...can you give that permission?!?!" `
`"It's valid. `
`...As the result of an impartial judgment, I guarantee this red truth." `
`"...Without telling us your reason?!" `
`"We'll tell you that soon. `
`...Very soon." `
`"...B-Battler hasn't proclaimed Kyrie dead with the red truth yet...! `
`It is allowed for Kyrie to be playing dead! `
`And the packing tape has already been used on three rooms, making it impossible for you to seal Kyrie's room...! `
`So how can you use the red truth to say that Kyrie can't save Battler?! `
`That red truth has no basis!!" `
`"We'll tell you its basis soon. `
`...But more importantly, Lambda...? `
`...The logic with Kyrie has ceased to function. `
`...You should probably find another piece to switch places with Battler, don't you think...?" `
`".........Nng, `
`...y- `
`yes. `
`...There are still pieces that can save Battler." `
`Reconstruct the logic. `
`...All we need is someone who can switch places with Battler. It doesn't have to be Kyrie. `
`"Then let's switch it to Natsuhi. `
`...Ushiromiya Natsuhi switched places with Battler...!" `
`"Dlanor, ...do it." `
`"As you {f:5:wish}." `
`Dlanor's red longsword...smashed Natsuhi's piece into little bits... `
`How...?! `
`How... `
`...can Erika deny this logic... `
`...without the detective's authority?! `
`"{p:1:Ushiromiya Natsuhi cannot save Battler.}" `
`"Th-Then Eva! `
`Ushiromiya Eva!!" `
`"{p:1:Ushiromiya Eva cannot save Battler.}" `
`"Then Rosa! `
`Maria!!" `
`"{p:1:{f:5:Useless}. `
`Rosa and Maria cannot save him {f:5:either}. `

`{f:5:DEATHDEATHDEATHDEATH} `
`<Die the {f:5:Death}>! `
`<Sentence to {f:5:Death}>! `
`<Great Equalizer is the {f:5:Death}>!!}" `
`"O-Objection! `
`Erika-san doesn't have the detective's authority! `
`...How can she use any red except for the packing tape seals...?!" `
`"Objection overruled. `
`...Not having the detective's authority does not imply that one cannot use any red at all. `
`......There's something she can use. `
`...Right?" `
`"Yes, ...there is. `
`There are several exceptions that even Humans without the detective's authority can use." `
`"...Insane... `
`...There's no way." `
`"Yes, there is {f:5:none}. `
`...However, ...there is a certain action permissible only to Humans without the detective's authority, `
`...and it can become a truth of such overwhelming credibility that `
`witches can easily raise it to the level of red {f:5:truth}." `
`"A certain action...... `
`permissible only to Humans who aren't the detective...?" `
`"......Y-You don't mean... `
`...Erika, ...you..." `
`"...I-I've got it. `
`...Yes, ...if I'm right, `
`this red truth is valid..." `
`"I-I don't understand! `
`Was there some power that could only be used without the detective's authority...?!" `
`"......There is. `
`...There is just one." `
`"So, you've finally noticed. `
`...That's right. `
`...That's the only reason...I abandoned the detective's authority this time around. `
`...You told me I could make the detective proclamation whenever I wanted, right? `
`...Well, unfortunately, `
`...I am no longer capable of making that proclamation." `
`"Which... `
`...Knox rule was it...?" `
`"{p:1:Knox's 7th. `
`......It is... `
`forbidden for the detective to be the culprit.}" `
`"Y-You mean... `
`...wh-whaaat?!" `
`...Finally, Beato realized everything. `
`Yes, ...the detective's authority bestows several powers that are useful for reasoning, `
`but it eliminates one single privilege. `
`That is Knox's 7th. `
`...It is forbidden for the detective to be the culprit... `
`"...In this game, `
`...it is impossible for Humans without the detective's authority to examine corpses perfectly. `
`...So, ...there have been several tricks where the dead have all been faking and walking around where they please. `
`...You probably thought you could use that logic to create several impossible crimes after this. `
`...When I said that I wouldn't make the detective proclamation, `
`somewhere on the inside, you must have said "I've won"." `
`"...You're pretty sly yourself. `
`You gave me the packing tape seals, seemingly out of mercy, `
`but that was because you planned to have all of the first twilight victims survive, band together, and carry out the crimes. `
`So, you gave me only three rooms' worth, which wouldn't cover all six people." `
`"No matter which rooms I sealed, at least one of your underlings could move freely. `
`......You must've been plotting to use that to corner me. `
`...But too bad. `
`Your naivety really pisses me off. `
`...Stupid man!" `
`"......I admit it. `
`...I admit that I fell for your monkey show... `
`and that in my pride, I tried to show you some mercy. `
`......That's right. `
`...Even without the detective's authority, ...there is a way for Humans to do it. `
`...A way to make sure that a corpse examination cannot fail." `
`Is the human lying in front of you alive or dead? `
`You can answer that question by examining the corpse. `
`With just a quick glance, your chances of being right are 50-50 either way. `
`Various bits of knowledge and experience can be used to obtain a more precise result. `
`......However, no matter how much you do that, `
`while you can reach up to 99%, you can never reach 100% accuracy. `
`...That's what most people would think. `
`However, there is one way. `
`...One way to conduct a perfect examination. `
`"And that is... `
`...to kill them." `
`"......Erikaa...aa..." `
`"Without the detective's authority, I can't tell whether the victims are dead or faking. `
`So, I needed a way to be sure. `
`...And, if possible, `
`it would be preferable if they were removed from the game board `
`so that they couldn't make a mess of things later on." `
`"So, I dashed through the chaos-filled mansion, `
`visited all the crime scenes, `
`and... `
`{p:1:I re-killed all of them.}" `
`"...Wh-What on...Earth......" `
`"......Of course, she couldn't just kill them however she liked. `
`...It had to be a perfect way of killing, good enough that their deaths could be determined with the red truth. `
`...Erika made sure of that." `
`"The manner in which they were each killed differed, `
`...but afterwards, `
`{p:1:she completely severed the heads of all those she killed.} `
`...That method of killing is solid enough to be called a red truth, right...? Lambda...?" `
`"...V-Valid. `
`No human could survive... `
`...after having their head sliced off...!" `
`"C-Could you have severed all of those heads without getting any blood on you?!" `
`"For example, you could take a large trash bag from the kitchen and grab the knife through it. `
`...Then, if you covered the entire corpse with the trash bag as you did your work, you'd block nearly all of the blood spatter." `
`I used enough knives and bags for several people, then left them there at the crime scene. `
`Of course, I didn't humiliate myself by walking around with them, leaving blood in the hallways and dirtying my clothes. `
`There will probably be trash bags left at the crime scenes with my fingerprints on them, `
`but since this game ends before the police come, that can't be used as evidence, `
`so there's no problem with leaving them there. `
`"...Are you insane? `
`......What kind of... `
`mystery would... `
`ever allow something like that...?" `
`"I can't believe I'm hearing this from a witch on the fantasy side. `
`Oh, and don't worry. `
`I didn't kill you. `
`...I didn't have time to sever the head of the last one found, `
`so I just sealed your whole room with the packing tape you gave me." `
`"...Then again, that might've been because I knew this would happen and wanted to watch you struggle. `
`......*giggle*, `
`...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*! `
`Oh, that's right. `
`...Just as I can say that I killed them in red, I can say one more thing." `
`At that point, Erika stopped for a second, `
`...and... `
`aaah, can she really be wearing an even uglier expression than everything before now...? `
`With that... `
`highest quality face, ...she spoke. `
`"{p:1:All five people I killed...were very much alive until the moment I killed them.} `
`...Everyone faithfully played dead as best they could until the moment just before I killed them, okay? `
`......Maria-san was quite the little trouper. `
`......After all, even though her mother had already been killed in the same room, `
`...she kept on playing dead without even noticing... `
`*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*-" `
`"Hahahahaha, `
`ahhahahahahahahahahaha... `
`hehahyahhahahahaahahaaahaaaah!!" `
`——They're demons. `
`Up until now, `
`...many witches and demons have appeared in this tale, `
`...but for the first time... `
`here are true... `
`demons... `
`"You bastards... `
`...you bastards... `
`...Uu...uugyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!" `
`This time, Beato understood the entire plot of this tale. `
`This tale...was just the story of a prank. `
`Surely, someone had thought of playing a slightly harsh trick on this inconsiderate guest, `
`who loved to show off her intelligence and act the part of a great detective, `
`...and several people had agreed to go along with it. `
`Then, the ones who would play the victims would go into their assigned rooms, set the chain and the lock from the inside, `
`...and play dead...to create a fake closed room murder... `
`...If you think about it that way, the rooms chosen for the corpses seem to make more sense. `
`It was only natural for Natsuhi to "die" in her own room. `
`...If you're going to play dead, it's only natural that you'd want to lie down on your own bed. `
`Eva's vanity is strong, so she must have asked to "die" in the VIP room. `
`Kyrie was in Krauss's study. `
`...That was probably well air-conditioned and comfortable. `
`Rosa and Maria were in the parlor. `
`A soft sofa should have been a great place to play dead. `
`...Maria had done her best and had impressively acted the part of lying dead alongside the wall. `
`Battler was in a guest room. `
`The temperature here was also nice. `
`The bed must also have been fairly pleasant. `
`...Yes. `
`The victims for this first twilight had all died in comfortable rooms. `
`In the past games, the corpses had often been found exposed in the courtyard or under the rose garden arbor. `
`In the cold gardening shed or in the boiler room... `
`This time, there were no victims in any such inhospitable environments. `
`This... `
`...is probably the truth. `
`This is the story of a prank, with no one dead from the beginning... `
`And then, `
`...this...demon... `
`...turned it into a real murder case...! `
`"...You do have the right to speak ill of Lady {f:5:Erika}. `
`...However, ...right now, you also have the obligation of showing a new logic that doesn't lead to any {f:5:contradictions}." `
`"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. `
`Corpses to corpses...! `
`Hey, Battler-san? Let's continue the game!! `
`Please present a different human to switch places with you. `
`If you don't, your trick...will become a logic error..." `
`There's now...no one who can come to the rescue. `
`Erika's killed all of them!! `
`"...D-Dammit, ...dammit, dammit, dammiiiiiiiiit!!" `
`"...Battler-san, please, calm yourself...! `
`Now's the time to hold back your tears and fight...! `
`Even if you've lost five pieces who can save you, there's still the 11 people in the guesthouse!" `
`"Y-You're right... `
`...Krauss, Hideyoshi, Rudolf, ...George, Jessica, Shannon, Kanon! `
`Genji, Gohda, Kumasawa, Nanjo!! `
`It doesn't matter who, as long as someone comes here!! `
`Somebody, somebody, heeeeeeeeelp!!" `
`"But it's no uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuse!! `
`Please, looook at thiiiiiiis! `
`Gertruude, `
`Corneliaaaaaaaaaaaa!!" `
`""Let it be known that we are here and ready."" `
`"Bwaattleeer-shwaaaaaann!! `
`Pweease, look at thiiiiiiiiiisss!! `
`Whhhaaaaat arrrre theeeesse?!" `
`Erika, who was now so excited that her pronunciation was tumbling all over the place, `
`pointed at two doors. `
`It was the hallway on the second floor of the guesthouse... `
`...They were in front of the cousin room and the next room over. `
`"Look, here, here! `
`There's something attached to the door?! `
`What is it?! What is it?! `
`Hey, what is it, Gertruuuuuuuuuuuude?!" `
`"...Know that it is the packing tape seal of the cousin room." `
`"<Oh, yeeeeeeeeaah>!! `
`<Very goooooooooooood>!! `
`<One more>!! `
`What about this dooooooooor?!?!" `
`"Know that it is the packing tape seal of the next room over." `
`"<Oh, very GOOD!!> `
`Okay, you two! `
`Why don't you show everyone watching at home on their TVs?!! `
`Please have a look at the packing tape seals on both doors!! `
`So, what do you think of them...?! `
`Are they broken, or aren't they...? `
`Please, let us have the red truth!!" `
`""{p:1:Please, allow me to speak. `
`Know that neither is broken.}"" `
`"{p:1:Know that an unbroken seal proves that there are still none who have entered or exited.}" `
`"{p:1:It needs no second telling, but know that entry or exit without breaking the seal is impossible!!}" `
`"<Good.> `
`...Battler, it is as you {f:5:see}. `
`...There no longer exists anyone who can save {f:5:you}." `
`The victims of the first twilight have all been killed! `
`And the guesthouse is still sealed!! `
`No one can come to the rescue...!! `
`"Uu... `
`ku... `
`gghh......!" `
`Erika had guessed that this moment might come so long ago, `
`...and that was why she had made the strategic move of suddenly sealing those two rooms. `
`This answered the doubts Cornelia had felt at the time. `
`Wondering why the human side player wouldn't want as many free humans as `
`possible was a natural, simple reaction to that move. `
`However, if you sealed up all humans, `
`...there would be no room for magic to intervene. `
`Why is magic magic? `
`Because the people who see it say that it's magic. `
`Then, is it possible for magic to exist in a place with no people? `
`...Does the lack of anti-magic toxin mean that there's no problem...? `
`Wrong! `
`Magic in a place that isn't being witnessed is no different from a delusion, a daydream! `
`Magic that matches a result must be carried out by human hands. `
`If all humans are sealed off, then magic cannot be created. `
`This was Erika's strategy for this game...and her beautiful...checkmate!! `
`"Well now. `
`...Who's going to come save you? `
`Please tell me the identity of the "real" person who switched places with you, remained in the guest room in your place, `
`and set the chain lock from the inside. `
`If they even exist." `
`"......Okay, Battler...? `
`Your logic has been interrupted. `
`...Who could have come to save you? `
`You are now in the middle of a logic error." `
`"Uu... `
`...w- `
`wait... `
`I'm still...thinking...!" `
`"...Battler, you have two options and one duty. `
`...The first option is to build a new thread of logic to reconstruct your closed room trick. `
`The second is to come clean and admit to your logic error. `
`And you're obligated to choose one of these options." `
`"It is merciful. `
`There's no restriction on the amount of time you have to make that choice. `
`......*giggle* That's right, your time is endless, eternal." `
`"I-I'm sure there's still some way, `
`...some twisted logic that can get you out of this... `
`...Anyway, ...I'm sure there's still some way...!" `
`"I'm thinking about it! `
`What about you, Beato?! `
`...Let me know if you find anything... `
`...I'm sure the old Beato...could have managed something... `
`She built up several closed rooms like this...!!" `
`Beato felt awful... `
`...Why was she Beato, and yet not?! `
`Surely, the old her would have thought up a trick under these restrictions. `
`If only she could do that, she could guide Battler to victory, ...but she couldn't do it as her current self! `
`"*giggle* `
`Yeah, I'm sure you'll think of a good trick. `
`Eventually, surely, probably, maybe. `
`...Pretty sure it's impossible though. `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!" `
`"...So then, Battler, `
`...let's go back to the guest room. `
`From now on, that will be your world." `
`Once again, ...they returned to the slightly chilly guest room. `
`It was the same room as before, of course, `
`...but it felt as though an unsettling darkness had crept in... `
`"Here's the room you'll spend your days in from now on. `
`......You just need to escape from this room by any means you want." `
`"...However, there are conditions. `
`...As I believe you know, these were all things you forced on yourself." `
`"...First, `
`{p:1:this room is a closed room created from the inside.} `
`{p:1:The seals on the windows are intact, so there can be no escape through there.} `
`{p:1:Of course, there is no way to escape by leaving through the bathroom.} `
`{p:1:...I'll make it simple.} `
`{p:1:There is no exit to escape from except for this door.} `
`{p:1:However, the chain lock on this door is set.} `
`{p:1:You can unset and reset it all you want, but you can only do so from the inside.} `
`{p:1:Furthermore, you are free to go out through the door, but you cannot leave or escape while the chain lock is unset.} `
`You have to show that you can escape from this room with the chain lock still connected...!!" `
`"...But... `
`...he couldn't possibly..." `
`"He couldn't possibly do it? `
`He made this closed room himself...!!" `
`"We have arranged for...just one exit other than the door. `
`...That one's in the bathroom." `
`"My merciful master has given you a last way out, if you fail to think of any trick to escape. `
`...Please listen up!!" `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} guided Battler to the bathroom. `
`It was just a normal bathroom. `
`The setup that had surprised Erika to buy time was no longer working. `
`However, the bundle of wire and the nippers that had been used to prepare that trap... `
`still lay in the empty bathtub. `
`"Are you saying...that I can use these to escape...?" `
`"Yes, please feel free. `
`It's a present. `
`...However, no matter what you use, you can't lock the room from the outside. `
`And you can't fool the seals either, okay? `
`These tools aren't here to help you pull some trick with the chain lock. `
`...They're here to let you escape from this room in a more direct way..." `
`"...H-How am I supposed to use these...?" `
`"...... `
`...Not bad, Bern. `
`...I see...that your mind's as grotesque as ever..." `
`"There is an exit that leads directly outside from this bathroom. `
`...Can you find it?" `
`"...Y-You don't mean..." `
`"D-Did you figure it out, Beato...?! `
`Please, tell me...!!" `
`"That's... `
`...i- `
`impossible......" `
`"Please, where is it?! Tell me!! `
`We can't let the game end like this!!" `
`"There..." `
`"Huh? Where...? `
`Under...the bathtub...?" `
`"Can't you see it? There's a round hole that leads straight out of this room." `
`"...It's a bit small though..." `
`"Y- `
`You people, `
`...you people... `
`...aahh, `
`...nngggyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh..." `
`"It's the drain right there at the bottom of the bathtub. `
`You can get out through there without touching the chain lock. `
`But your body is a bit too big to get through this exit. `
`That's why I decided to lend you those tools there." `
`You can escape...through the drain...? `
`How...? `
`She couldn't mean using those nippers for a hundred years to widen that hole, right...? `
`Battler and Beato...had already realized. `
`...They had figured out this demonic way out that the demons were proposing... `
`"Just use those nippers, `
`...and cut your body down to a size that can fit." `
`"...*crunch*crunch*. `
`...Might as well sit back in the tub under a hot shower... `
`as you start from your feet going up...chip then wash, chip then wash... `
`Just keep doing that and, oh, what do you know, `
`you've suddenly managed to escape from the closed room." `
`""Oh, what do you know" is right, my master...! `
`Looks like both siblings are gonna end up the same way...! `
`Heheh...heheheheheheheheheeheheheh!!" `
`"But Bern...? `
`At that rate, just the hand holding the nippers will be left." `
`"That's why we have the wire... `
`...Beforehand, Battler will have to wrap the wire around his wrist, then stretch the other end out into the corridor through the crack in the door. `
`...You should be able to fit just a wrist through the crack left by the chain lock." `
`"...If you're willing to do that, I'd be happy to pull that wire from the hallway and save you." `
`"My master, if you do that, I want it!! `
`Battler's wrist... `
`eheheheheheheheheeheheheheheheh!!" `
`"And what would you use that for...? `
`But no, I've already decided to use it as a back scratcher. `
`When the time comes, I'll scratch your back with it. What do you say?" `
`"Y-Yeees, my master... `
`...Master's going to scratch my back... `
`with B-Battler's handhahahaaaaaaaaaaahaaaaaaaaaahhh!!" `
`"......Finding them annoying? `
`Irritating? Obnoxious? `
`...Don't worry, it'll get quiet really soon. `
`...All noise to disturb your thoughts... `
`...will now disappear for all eternity, until you can escape from this room." `
`"Th-That's a relief... `
`I'll be glad of the quiet...!" `
`"......Here's...some advice from a survivor of hell. `
`...Enjoy this noise while you can. `
`......Even the annoying insults you hear now... `
`...will bring you fond memories to preserve your sanity amidst the eternal silence." `
`......Do you hate Bern and Erika? `
`Then that's their parting gift to you. `
`...As long as you have hatred, you'll be able to avoid giving up. `
`Giving up has a completely different meaning here, okay...? `
`...Prepare yourself while you can... `
`for the eternity of the hell you'll be in when you've given up, ...but still cannot escape. `
`"Did you just call yourself a survivor...? `
`...Then, `
`...you also..." `
`"...You know, ......every once in a while, `
`...that terror comes back to me. `
`......I wonder...whether I really have escaped from that hell. `
`......What if...I actually lost my mind a long time ago... `
`...and I'm still in there, `
`just seeing a delusion of us all chatting happily like this...? `
`...That nightmare still terrifies me... `
`...And so, I need to constantly feel...truly feel that this isn't a dream... `
`...Hey, ...are you guys...really...real...? `
`...You aren't just an insane delusion I'm having inside that hell, ...right...? Right? ...Right...?" `
`There was something in {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s pleading expression that sent shivers down the spine. `
`It was probably more terrifying than any threatening words she could have used with even the most vile expression on her face... `
`It's time for Battler to realize. `
`...A logic error isn't so sympathetic that you can just stick out your tongue, `
`ask for forgiveness, and say you'll be more careful next time... `
`It is never worth risking one by leaving things up to chance, even if you feel that you can't back down at this point in the fight... `
`It's time for him to face reality and learn the true risks and terrors implied by the words "betting one's life on a fight", `
`which must sound so exciting for a man... `
`"Battler-san, get ahold of yourself...! `
`I'll think deeply upon it as well! `
`I'll think of a trick to escape this room with all I've got...! `
`I will come to save you...!!" `
`"B-Beato... `
`...Uuu...uuuwwaaaaaaaaaahhhh... `
`I'll definitely think of something, ...just waaaaaaatch..." `
`"Well, regretfully, it's time for us to leave. `
`We mustn't get in the way of his job any longer." `
`"See you later, `
`Battler-san. `
`...Or, like you'd say it, <see you again>, right? `
`<Have a nice day>... `
`*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*!" `
`"......Later, `
`...Battler. `
`...Good luck." `
`"Battler-san, don't give up...! `
`You'll certainly think of a trick! `
`I'll think as well, and I'll come to save you!!" `
`"B-Beato......?!" `
`Before he could finish saying Beato's name, ...they had all disappeared. `
`...They hadn't disappeared in a golden spray, or turned into butterflies and flown away... `
`Just as though there had never been anyone in this room `
`since the beginning, `
`......everyone but him had vanished in an instant. `
`Nothing remained... `
`...Not their voices, their presence, their warmth, `
`...nor even the faint perfume Beato had worn. `
`The frigid air of the room was wrapped only in the lonely sound of the wind and rain... `
`With that overpowering feeling of isolation, `
`...I finally began to realize...how horrible a punishment this would be... `
`"...D-Damn those bastards... `
`...It can't be that hard to get out of a room like this... `
`I mean, rooms are made so that people can go in and out of them, right...? `
`...If they can't do that, you wouldn't call it a room." `
`How pointless... `
`...It's easy to undo the lock and chain from the inside. `
`...Dammit... `
`For some reason, I've always been clumsy, `
`...and undoing chain locks always gives me trouble. `
`Oh, ...it's off. `
`Heheh, ...heh...how pointless. `
`Look, ...I can already open the door whenever I want... `
`...Hey, `
`...what's this cold feeling on my neck...? `
`What the hell is this......? `
`...Why is there suddenly this iron collar around my neck...that's attached to a chain? `
`Dammit, who would do something like that... `
`...Wh-When I reset the chain lock, it disappears. `
`And when I take it off, it appears. `
`The chain's pretty long, so I can make it pretty far out into the hallway. `
`But it won't let go of the door... `
`Then if I close the door, `
`......stand on the outside and stick my hand through the crack, `
`...maybe I can figure out how to set the chain... `
`......Nngg...geh... `
`Why...have I always been so clumsy...? `
`...I'm not really clumsy, ...it's just that me and chain locks don't go well together... `
`Dammit, ...I hate chain locks, ...I hate chains... `
`Why...won't it work...? `
`Why...can't I set the chain lock from the outside...? `
`Dammit...dammit...dammit... `
`...Nng... `
`ggyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh...!!! `
`"...Battler-san, `
`...Battler-san!! `
`Hang in there, hang in there...!!" `
`"...... `
`...Can't...get out... `
`...ggh...kk..." `
`Beato called out to Battler repeatedly, shaking his shoulders hard, ...but by now, Battler's eyes were blank. `
`...The words didn't reach him... `
`{f:5:Bernkastel} and Erika had already left. `
`The game was officially suspended until Battler could think of a new trick, `
`...but it was doubtful that it would be resumed even after a thousand years...or more... `
`"...Okay, I'm heading off too. `
`...So long, you two." `
`"Th-There's no need to say "so long"...! `
`We'll...we'll think of a trick right away, and the game will resume! `
`We won't take up your time...! `
`So stay here a little longer...! Please...!!" `
`"...We've heard those same words from many witches in the past. `
`...And I've heard of hardly any who've actually managed to resume their games. `
`...As far as I know, the only two are me...and Bern." `
`"Why...why would a person who knows about that hell throw another person into it?! `
`Just because you're bored? `
`Is that all?!" `
`"......Yeah, that's all. `
`...It's to escape from boredom. `
`...Because when we get bored, ...we remember. `
`We remember that hell. `
`...And, you know, `
`...by throwing someone else down into that hell, `
`...we realize that, oh, we're the ones on the throwing side, `
`...and that means we aren't in that hell ourselves. `
`...If we don't keep doing that, `
`......then the fear of that hell will overwhelm us..." `
`"...If you two managed to get out of it, then he certainly will! `
`I will save him...!! I can say it with certainty...!!!" `
`"With "certainty"...? `
`...You swear with certainty before me, `
`{f:5:Lambdadelta}, the Witch of Certainty...?" `
`"Yes, with certainty...!!" `
`"...... `
`...Very well. `
`I was the guardian for the former "you" anyway. `
`...Though the current you is different, `
`...I'll take care of you one last time. `
`...I'll give you a parting gift." `
`"And what...is that...?" `
`"Hope. `
`......As long as you hold on to your "certainty", your wishes will definitely come true." `
`"........." `
`"Are you listening? `
`The old "you" was the Endless Witch {f:5:Beatrice}. `
`...You used to love detective novels that depicted impossible crimes, `
`and you used those to make the claim that a witch existed, to make many people believe in magic... `
`as one stage on your path to becoming a witch." `
`"...Detective...novels..." `
`"That's right. `
`The old you was an avid reader. `
`...You loved detective novels, loved closed room murders...and were a super expert on impossible crimes. `
`You searched for and found several closed room tricks, `
`...found the single most basic element to all of them, and used that to form the core of your magical compendium." `
`"...Didn't Battler tell you? `
`...He said that the old "you" would definitely have thought of a way out of this predicament. `
`......I agree with that. `
`I guarantee it by the name of the Witch of Certainty, {f:5:Lambdadelta}. `
`...The old "you" would definitely have resolved this closed room trick..." `
`".........!" `
`"...That's my parting gift to you. `
`......Goodbye. `
`You've sworn to the Witch of Certainty that you'll act with certainty. `
`So I won't say farewell. `
`..."I'll see you again soon"." `
`"...Y-Yes. `
`...We'll see you again...soon...!" `
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} vanished into thin air... `
`Then, in the smoking room of the witch, `
`...the two who held the title of Endless Witch...were left behind. `
`One had empty eyes. `
`The other supported the first by his side. `
`...Ironically, ...it was the exact opposite... `
`of how their relationship had been in the previous game... `
