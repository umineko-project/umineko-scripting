`"...Back then I was, and I guess I still am, a bit of a klutz... `
`I always forgot where I'd put things...or think I'd locked something up when I'd actually forgotten. `
`...I caused a lot of trouble." `
`"Hahaha, I remember how Aunt Natsuhi used to get mad at you all the time." `
`"But eventually, Shannon managed to overcome all that forgetfulness." `
`"Oh, and how'd you do that?" `
`"...Heheh. `
`It wasn't anything big, ...but I got into the habit of writing things down. `
`I'd write down wherever I put something important. `
`...For things that happened often, I made a checklist and always made sure to check it..." `
`"So? `
`Did you see Beatrice, or didn't you?" `
`"Oh, umm, `
`...I didn't see her directly, `
`...but, well, `
`...some very strange things did happen..." `
`She was talking about a certain summer night. `
`Shannon had been doing the nightly rounds... `
`From her perspective, it was a ghost story. `
`From the witch's perspective, ...it was just the story of a little summer's night prank... `
`"Little sister, `
`do you understand the anti-magic toxin that Humans possess?" `
`"N-No. `
`What is it, Onee-sama?" `
`"Well, `
`the time of witches has long since passed. `
`...Those vile Humans who claim to rule over everything came to deny our existence and possess a powerful toxin." `
`"Is that toxin harmful to us...?" `
`"It is extremely dangerous. `
`If we were exposed to it, our forms would probably evaporate in an instant. `
`However, one thing we do have in our favor is the fact that our existence is still extremely weak. `
`Because of that, the toxin does not affect us greatly. `
`At worst, it can only transform us into mist for a time." `
`"However, we'd rather avoid it if we can, right?" `
`"Correct. `
`Yes, I see that you are indeed me. `
`You catch on quickly." `
`The older sister appeared to be haughty at first, `
`......but, perhaps because she was so happy to have met her double and little sister, she was more than willing to teach her anything she wanted to know. `
`The first thing she taught was that they were witches, `
`a different type of being than Humans. `
`Beato had thought her inability to use magic meant she wasn't a witch, `
`but apparently, she was still a witch nonetheless. `
`And, she learned that witches like her were bound by various limitations, unlike Humans. `
`The greatest of those restrictions was the anti-magic toxin possessed by Humans. `
`"So, in other words, we mustn't enter a Human's field of vision..." `
`"Correct. `
`You can think of it as though Human eyes radiate the toxin. `
`If they see you, it is the same as your body being burnt. `
`And though the effect is weaker, being heard or sensed can also result in contact with the toxin." `
`"...So, even just getting close to Humans is dangerous to us..." `
`Wasn't Father a Human...? `
`Why am I not burnt by Father's toxin...? `
`"If we stock up magical power and have it acknowledged by humans, that toxin can be reduced drastically. `
`In other words, by having our existence acknowledged by humans, we make them lose their toxin, `
`making it possible for us to appear before them once more." `
`"I see... `
`Simply put, as we are now, we can only exist when Humans aren't around..." `
`"We are still very lacking in magical power, `
`which makes us inferior to even a stray cat hiding from humans in the shadows." `
`The main goal of the older sister was to gain a large supply of magical power and be revived as a great witch strong enough to have no fear of the anti-magic toxin. `
`For that purpose, she had wandered around the mansion night after night, `
`striving to regain her magical power and reduce the anti-magic power of the Humans... `
`The powerful previous Beatrice, whom she had read about in Featherine's library, `
`had appeared openly in front of Humans and had even toyed with them at will. `
`...According to her big sister, such a level of power was most impressive. `
`"To think that a witch could appear openly before humans and use magic at will! `
`...A witch like that would be so great that even I can hardly imagine it. `
`Is that what we will eventually become?" `
`"Yes. `
`...She was like a witch from a picture book, appearing openly before the Humans of the mansion and summoning magic and underlings at will..." `
`"Hmmm, how inspiring. `
`If that is our future, it means that all of our hard work will have been worth the effort." `
`"That's right. `
`...Anyway, Onee-sama, `
`how is that goal connected to going around unlocking windows like this...?" `
`It was the middle of the night. `
`They were following behind servants, who were checking the locks on the doors and windows...and undoing those locks after the servants thought they had been set. `
`...It felt more like a child's prank than the work of a witch... `
`"Heheheh, this is the path that leads to becoming a great witch. `
`All journeys begin with a single step. `
`To those who cannot understand, that first step may look quite foolish from time to time. `
`However, it is still a momentous first step...!" `
`With pride, as though making the first step for mankind on the surface of the moon, `
`the older sister undid the lock on a window with a *click*. `
`"Do you not understand, little sister? `
`Can you not see why a little thing like this is so momentous?" `
`"......? `
`No, Onee-sama, `
`...I don't really understand." `
`The older sister closed her eyes lightly, smiled, and opened the unlocked window a crack. `
`Cool outside air flowed in, making the curtains flutter. `
`"Let us put it in the toxin-filled words of a Human. `
`...We are not supposed to exist on this island. `
`I shall go further. `
`'Right now, there is no one in this corridor'. `
`And yet, the lock has been undone, ...and the window has opened. `
`...Can you see how great a miracle, a work of magic, ...a proof of our existence that is? `
`Even you should understand the coolness of this breeze..." `
`"...I do understand. `
`It's nice and cool..." `
`"The coolness, the softness of the breeze. `
`...And the feel of the fluttering curtain touching your hair. `
`...All of these things show that we truly are here." `
`"So, ...by unlocking the window like this, we can leave behind proof that we really did exist." `
`"...And that is why I unlocked it." `
`Of course, it wasn't just small pranks like opening a window. `
`...She could also smash windows and vases or leave behind strange fires and mysterious scribbles. `
`In fact, one time, she actually did play a large-scale prank in the kitchen, `
`piling up kitchenware in an eerie manner and leaving behind a bizarre scribble, which scared the servants considerably. `
`It was a complete success. `
`She'd really managed to scare the servants and had succeeded in making them acknowledge the existence of magic, weakening the anti-magic toxin... `
`However, she usually chose to make her presence known by unlocking windows. `
`The act of unlocking...symbolized her release from the limitations imposed by the Humans' toxin. `
`"One day, `
`I will...no, we will become a single witch and rule over all of Rokkenjima. `
`...When that time comes, we will gain complete freedom and will be capable of stretching our wings as we please." `
`We won't have to be afraid of anyone's gaze anymore. `
`We'll be able to fly wherever we wish, disappear whenever we want. `
`Laugh however we like, prank however we like, talk with anyone we want to. `
`Humans might ask things of us from time to time. `
`They might fight with us or play with us too. `
`What wonderful things for us frail creatures, `
`who cannot appear before anyone, to look forward to... `
`"...Right now, they are little more than pranks. `
`However, as they pile up, proof that we exist will begin to gather. `
`The servants already call me the witch, Beatrice, master of the night, `
`and are beginning to believe in me bit by bit." `
`"The more they believe, the more those Humans will lose their anti-magic toxin..." `
`...I see... `
`So, this means that Father has no anti-magic toxin. `
`And, ......that's because he truly believes in the existence of the witch I am, without any doubts. `
`I finally realize that, though I thought him to be cold, Father does possess a kindness that can't be seen... `
`"I'd like to become a great witch and appear in front of everyone soon." `
`"Indeed. `
`Eventually, we will be able to appear openly in front of anyone. `
`By doing that repeatedly, we shall make people believe in us even more, ...and eventually, we shall display even our magic for all to see. `
`...At that time, we shall descend upon Rokkenjima as the great witch you told me of. Ahahahahaha!" `
`"...The logic of the witch side is quite interesting. `
`It keeps me entertained." `
`"It does sound credible, in a way. `
`When Humans are frightened to hear that they've entered a ghost hot-spot, `
`they're likely to start yelling 'ghost, ghost!' at the drop of a hat." `
`"That's right. `
`At a fundamental level, all phenomena are neutral, indifferent, and dull. `
`...If you want them be viewed in a certain way, you must first create a suitable environment..." `
`"If a person has charisma, people will interpret what they do in a positive way, even when they screw up. `
`...I see. `
`I guess in that sense, the Beatos' small efforts aren't misguided." `
`"If it was just the mansion's locks being undone, everything could be resolved by saying that someone forgot to lock up or that it was some kind of prank. `
`...However, the rumors of a witch wandering about the mansion night after night slowly began to take shape as the existence of the witch." `
`"An environment was established so that, if anything strange happened in the mansion at night, it would all be viewed as the work of the witch. `
`...I get it. If you follow that reasoning to an extreme, `
`then what you get is no different from a witch existing in the mansion at night." `
`After the Beatos finished their mischief of unlocking and opening the window, `
`they enjoyed the coolness of the wind and the brightness of the moon, then became gold butterflies and disappeared into the darkness. `
`...There was no way of knowing whether the window they had opened had actually been opened by them. `
`The servants might have forgotten to lock up, `
`or one of the family might have opened it after the servants had locked up and forgotten to shut it again, `
`or maybe someone had played a prank. `
`In the same way that none of those possibilities could be denied, `
`...it was also impossible to deny the possibility that a witch really had opened a window to enjoy the night breeze... `
`"......A result without an observer can possess an endless number of ways in which it might have occurred. `
`...Humans who can't grasp anything more than a single possibility are unable to imagine anything." `
`"However, people who believe in the possibility of a witch can imagine that it was a witch's prank. `
`...When that happens, the scene of the Beatrices' prank that we have just seen is etched into the Fragment as a fact..." `
`"...That's one of the foundations of magic. `
`Embellishing...the process." `
`With just a little magic, even a mass-produced stuffed animal... `
`...can be reborn as a wonderful, unique stuffed animal filled with a mother's love. `
`If you doubt it, ...it'll be burnt by the anti-magic toxin. `
`If you believe it, that magic will become the truth. `
`"......... `
`...Not all magic is bad. `
`...Maria onee-chan was right. `
`...Good magic exists too." `
`"It may be necessary for a child of man to possess the power to repel evil magic. `
`...However, refusing to burn away and defile love-filled magic is part of how love in the human world works." `
`"...... `
`...Well, good magic is the only kind I can forgive. `
`...For all other kinds, the best remedy is to deny them and burn them away." `
`"Heheheheheheheh... `
`A typical answer for a child of man." `
`"Getting back to the point. `
`...Knowing this much, `
`I guess this means that the ghost Beatrice, who was called the ruler of Rokkenjima's night, doesn't really exist. `
`It's nothing more than a general term for any inexplicable occurrences that take place in the mansion after dark. `
`In other words, Beatrice isn't the name of a person, it's the name of a phenomenon." `
`If anything bizarre happens, it all becomes the work of the Golden Witch... `
`That 'environment in which a witch could exist' is what Beatrice is. `
`"...That keeps building on itself until we reach 1986. `
`...This is the veil that the true culprit is hiding behind. `
`And the person hiding behind it is, without a doubt, a Human." `
`"Perhaps that holds true at this point in the witches' tale of the past. `
`...However, I doubt you can use that argument alone to fight all the way through 1986, don't you...?" `
`"........." `
`"Heheheheheheheheh..." `
`"Ridiculous. `
`Wasn't that obviously because someone forgot to lock up?" `
`"...W-Well, you may say that, but...umm... `
`B-But this isn't just something that happened once or twice..." `
`"In other words, you're a klutz, a fool, `
`and a moron of a servant who forgot to check not just once or twice, but many times over?" `
`"...Shannon isn't the only one. `
`That same window was always opened even when other servants did the rounds." `
`"Yeah, Mom even asked me if I'd ever left a window open in the hall at night. `
`I had absolutely nothing to do with it, but she still got pissed. `
`Sheesh." `
`"I'm sure Beatrice wanted to gaze at the moon. `
`Uu-." `
`"It is a bit creepy to have that happen over and over at the same window. `
`...And that time when the kitchenware was piled up in the kitchen, with a creepy magic circle scribbled there...sounds even more freaky." `
`"...Y-Yes. `
`They said it was an eerie magic circle drawn with something like blood... `
`Ever since then, people have been scared to patrol the kitchen..." `
`"About the case of the eerie magic circle in the kitchen... `
`Who witnessed that?" `
`"Well, ...uh, ...it wasn't me... `
`I, uh...think I heard about it from a servant kid who quit. `
`I wasn't on duty that day..." `
`"So, it's basically like this. `
`Just like those exaggerated stories you hear about haunted locations all over the world, you servants like to have a little fun telling ghost stories about the nighttime mansion, right? `
`You talk as though the witch exists and infect others with that belief." `
`"...So, all of the eerie things that are supposedly done by Beatrice are baseless rumors, `
`which are either the result of coincidence and accident or something that someone fabricated for fun. `
`...Is that what you're trying to say?" `
`"Exactly. `
`Of course there's no way Beatrice exists." `
`"Uu-... `
`Beatrice exists." `
`"I'm glad you understand so well, Battler-san. `
`...There's probably some person by that name, or else multiple persons of a fixed or unfixed number who do things and attribute it to that name. `
`However, this delusion of a Golden Witch Beatrice that we're all thinking of... `
`is completely impossible." `
`"Uu-!! `
`Uu-uu-uu-!! `
`Beatrice exists! `
`I've met her!!" `
`"Ooh, could you tell me about that in detail? `
`You met Beatrice? `
`And did she show you magic or something?" `
`"Uu-! `
`I see her all the time! `
`Every time I come to Rokkenjima! `
`And she always shows me fun magic!!" `
`Denying the existence of the witch would always have the immediate effect of infuriating Maria. `
`However, Erika, who didn't know this trick to avoiding Maria's fury, plunged into it head-on. `
`But no matter how Maria tried to sell the idea of Beatrice's existence, she stood no chance of defeating the ruthlessly intelligent Erika in an argument... `
`George and Jessica hurriedly tried to calm Maria down, but there could be no quelling her anger at this point. `
`"<Good>! `
`So, she showed you magic? `
`Could you explain in detail what kind of magic?" `
`"She would always use magic to give me candy as a present!! `
`Beato can create candy with magic!!" `
`"Are you sure she didn't just take it out of her pocket?" `
`"No, she didn't!! `
`It was magic! `
`It was incredible!! Tons of candies poured out of an empty cup!" `
`"W-Wow, that's some awesome magic..." `
`"That's right, that really would be magic...!" `
`"Yeah, it was magic!! `
`It really was empty!! `
`I checked inside it myself!!" `
`"Huh? `
`What do you mean, you checked inside it?" `
`"G-Give it a rest, Erika-san... `
`She's just a kid..." `
`"Come to think of it, Erika-sama, ...would you like some more t- `
`...kyah-" `
`"<No thank you>. `
`I'm having a seriously intellectual discussion over here. `
`You outsiders can stay out of this! `
`You'll have to tell me in more detail, Maria-san. `
`What do you mean when you say that you checked inside it? `
`Fortunately, we have right here with us a tea cup that's just been overturned and emptied! `
`Come on, be my guest and reenact what happened then, okay?! `
`Let's see it, if you would, let's see it!!" `
`After holding the cup of black tea, which she had just overturned and was still dripping, upside down over the table, `
`Erika slammed it down hard and slid it over to Maria. `
`Erika's eyes glowed repulsively, like those of a snake about to snap up a frog. `
`Those eyes were ice-cold and had a madness in them that made one want to avert their gaze. `
`On the other hand, Maria was glaring furiously, `
`her whole body shaking uncontrollably, in the greatest expression of anger that a human can manage. `
`The look on her face was frightening, ...not at all what you'd expect from a nine-year-old girl. `
`"St-Stop it, both of you...!" `
`"Uuu--!!! `
`Okay!! `
`Beatrice took the empty cup!! `
`And then she did this!! `
`She put it upside down on the table!!" `
`"Yeah, and then what?! `
`Did she lift it up right away, and candies flowed out?! `
`Incredible, that really would be magic, right? ...It {i:would} be!!!" `
`Battler and the others tried to get between the two and calm them down, `
`but it was no use. `
`They violently pushed aside the others, `
`and, glaring at each other from so close that their foreheads banged together, they repeatedly slammed the upside down cup on the table. `
`The sound of their foreheads banging together and the cup being slapped down...shattered the barrier between reality and illusion...!! `
`"It is magic, it is magic!! `
`Beato used magic to make candies appear!!" `
`"Then why don't you reproduce it for us?!! `
`Founder of Mariage Sorciere, {f:5:Maria}, the Witch of Origiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinsss!!" `
`"Lady Erika, this opponent is not worth your {f:5:time}. `
`This battle is not worth {f:5:fighting}..." `
`"Shut up, murder doll!! `
`Okay!! `
`How do you claim that the overturned cup was filled with candies?!" `
`"Just turning the cup over won't make candies come out!! `
`Because you have to use magic!! `
`Beato can use magic because she's a witch!!" `
`"Oh yes, magic, she used magic!! `
`How did she use magic?! `
`Did she swing a magic wand and tap the cup to make candies pour out?! `
`*giggle* No, that can't be it. Right?!" `
`"Beato is a witch, so she uses magic! `
`Magic happens when you say an incantation and cause a miracle!! `
`You can't use the magic that makes candy unless you say the incantation!!" `
`"Oh, sure, understood. <Good>, <good>, very <good>!! `
`Let's see this incantation, let's see this magic, come on, what kind of incantation would a witch use? What kind?!?!" `
`"Come, try and picture it!! `
`The inside of the cup is filled with candies!! `
`Try and picture such a wonder!" `
`"Ooooooooooh? And then whaaaaaaat?" `
`"Look, the inside of the cup... `
`...is filled with candy!!!" `
`Maria grasped the overturned cup so tightly that it nearly cracked, `
`...and slowly... `
`...lifted it up... `
`Then, ...from the inside, `
`...several cute candies poured out...! `
`Maria looked at Erika with a full smile, as if to say 'that showed you'. `
`"<Good>!! `
`And this is what you'd like to call Beatrice's magic, is it?! `
`Dlanoooooooooor!! `

`"{p:2:This wouldn't have anything to do with a trick in the actual cup or table, making this just a sleight of hand, right?} `
`That would be against the rules, wouldn't it?!?!" `
`"Hidden devices and tricks are in violation of Knox's {f:5:3rd}. `

`Knox's 3rd prohibits hidden doors and devices that have no clues pointing towards them. `
`However, by presenting foreshadowing and clues that point towards the existence of said devices, `
`Knox's 8th allows them to be used. `
`"{p:1:There were no tricks like that!! `

`So it was magic, not sleight of hand!!" `
`"...{f:5:Understood}. `

`"Ahahahahahahahahaha!! `
`That's right, with the 9th at least!! `
`Observers are always allowed to speak their personal opinions! `
`Otherwise, mysteries where the culprit is seen dressed up as a woman and it's written 'I saw a woman' would all be disqualified!! `
`Sure, that's fine, claim that you saw magic all you want!!" `
`"All truths are nothing more than claims! `
`So, I'll make a different claim and see straight through yours to the truth!! `
`That's the detective's duty, and where we shine the mooooooost!!" `
`"There's nothing to see through, this is magic!!!" `
`"Since it is magic, only witches can use it, right?" `
`"That's right, only witches can use it!!" `
`"...So, if a Human like me could use it too, `
`that would mean it isn't magic, right?" `
`"You can't use it!!! `
`Only Beato can use magic!!" `
`"<Good>!! `
`Then why don't I show you?!! `
`I'll make candy appear from out of this empty cup!!" `
`"If you think you can, just try!! `
`Impossible, impossible, useless, useless! There's no way a Human can do it!!" `
`"Then please, please, please just relax and watch!! `
`Here we have an empty cup. `
`Is that okay? It is, isn't it? `
`Then we turn it over on the table like this!!" `
`"...Let it be known that this fight has no purpose..." `
`"............" `
`"Okay, can you say the incantation for creating candies? `
`In fact, why don't we say it together? `
`Come, try and picture it!!" `
`"The inside of the cup is filled with candy!! `
`Try and picture such a wonder!!" `
`"<Stooop>!! `
`Maria-san, `
`why did you close your eyes when you said the incantation? `
`Why not witness the miracle of magic?" `
`"Humans are polluted by the anti-magic toxin!! `
`If a lowly Human saw it, the miracle of magic would be wiped out of existence!! `
`That's why the rules say that lowly Humans have to close their eyes when using magic!!" `
`"I see, I see. Okay, I understand the protocol for Humans to follow when magic's being used!! `
`In other words, not once have you ever witnessed the moment that magic happened! Isn't that right?! `
`Look, it's done now! `
`Please, try and lift up the cup, okay...? `
`After all, I've used magic to make candies appear." `
`"There's no way someone who makes fun of witches could use candy magic...!" `
`"Then if it actually does work, it'd be pretty amazing, huh?" `
`After glaring at Erika with the utmost of malice, `
`...Maria slowly stretched her hand out towards the overturned cup... `
`...There was no way that Erika, someone who made fun of witches like this, could ever use magic. `
`There was no way that there'd be candy there... `
`"......So, how's it look inside?" `
`"...... `
`......Ah-" `
`...And there...lay a single...candy with a cute wrapper... `
`"......See?" `
`"............" `
`"...This is magic, right?" `
`Erika smiled gently... `
`A look of disbelieving shock rose to Maria's eyes, `
`...along with envy for this person who could use the same magic as Beato... `
`"Erika, `
`...you can...use magic too...?" `
`"See? It's magic, isn't it? `
`What I did there." `
`"...Y-Yeah!!" `
`"So, in other words-" `
`Erika smiled pleasantly. `
`...She and Maria had finally reached a deep understanding... `
`"Of course it issssssssnnnnnnnnnnn't!!! `
`" `
`{p:2:While you had your eyes closed, I just lifted the cup up and tossed a candy in!! `
`You call that magic? `
`It's just a third-rate triiiiiick, hyahhaaaaaaah!!!} `
`There's my blue truth as the detective. `
`Now, as the Witch of Truth, here's my red truuuuuuuuuuth!!!" `
`{p:1:Your so-called candy magic is nothing more than a sleight of hand!! `
`Just a sleight of hand that the fake witch calling herself Beatrice or whatever claimed was magic!!} `
`I mean, seriously, did you really get fooled by such a stupid parlor trick? `
`Any magic related by your perspective can't be trusted at all!!! `
`"{p:2:Everything you ever thought was magic was just a trick that you didn't get!! `
`There's no way that was magic! There's no way magic exiiiiiiiiiiiiiists!!}" `
`"...Huuuh?!" `
`"{p:2:I-It might have been sleight of hand when you put candy in this cup, `
`but that doesn't prove that Beato's magic was also sleight of hand}. `
`Uryuuu--!!!" `
`"{p:2:However, you also can't prove that only magic could've done it!! `
`You rotten stuffed animaaaal!!}" `
`"...Please, allow me to speak." `
`"Know that this is a meaningless battle." `
`"You goddamn scraps of paper!! `
`Why'd you have to butt in at the good part...?!!" `
`"That is {f:5:enough}. `
`Lady {f:5:Maria} has been shown that the candy cup magic could possibly be a trick that she misunderstood to be {f:5:magic}. `
`Therefore, her claim that it was magic is {f:5:dismissed}." `
`"{p:2:However, it might really have been magic when Maria saw it...! `
`Just because it can be done by sleight of hand doesn't disprove magic.}" `
`"...Well done, Lady Erika. `
`Congratulations on crushing Lady {f:5:Maria}'s Illusion of the {f:5:witch}." `
`An 'Illusion of the Witch' occurs when someone tries to force the acknowledgement of magic by claiming that a thing would be impossible without it. It's how witches launch an attack. `
`If someone's able to successfully argue back and show that it would be possible without magic, the Illusion of the Witch is defeated, and the witch must retreat. `
`The magic Maria claimed to have seen could have been a trick, so it was unqualified to be acknowledged as magic. `
`However, that was only the result of this battle. `
`It was still too early to bring the fight into the domain of denying Beatrice, the witch and the magic that Maria believed in... `
`However, battles always end instantly when your opponent surrenders. `
`Erika had wanted to hit Maria with everything at once, defiling the witch and magic she believed in... `
`and crushing it without a fragment of compassion... `
`"...... `
`...Tch!! `
`Just one more step and I'd have been able to take a heart as innocent as the smooth sand just after a wave has pulled back...and tear it to bits. `
`......What a shame. `
`This isn't any fun anymore. `
`......Are you satisfied now?! `
`Ouch, ...owowowow..." `
`Erika grumpily punched Dlanor's arm that had been restraining her. `
`However, that cold, hard, marble-like arm just made Erika's hand hurt. `
`"......D-Diplomatic immunity...! `
`This battle is over...!" `
`"Allow me to speak. `
`Diplomatic immunity accepted." `
`"...Know that this fight is childish." `
`"Did you say something?!" `
`"She did {f:5:not}. `
`...Let us {f:5:withdraw}. `
`Lady {f:5:Maria} is no enemy of yours, Lady {f:5:Erika}. `
`There is no need to pay any attention to small fry such as {f:5:this}." `
`"......Hmph. `
`...You're right. `
`How childish of me, tearing a kid's dreams apart. `
`I'm really sorry, okay? `
`I apologize for my momentary lack of elegance. `
`*giggle*giggle* `
`Let's go." `
`Erika and the others turned their backs on Maria, who was still crouching down limply. `
`However, `
`...as detectives in famous mysteries have always done in the past, `
`Erika clapped her hands, stopped, and turned around. `
`"Oh, that's right. `
`...What do you think...?" `
`"......?" `
`"Simply by the existence of the overturned cup, `
`this level of reasoning was possible for Furudo Erika. `
`......What do you think, everyone?" `
`"......!" `
`Erika's merciless words gouged themselves into Maria's heart once more... `
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, `
`ahhahahahaahahahahhaahaha!!! `
`Erika left, leaving an evil laugh behind her. `
`After bowing to Maria and Sakutarou, Dlanor left too. `
`...Gertrude and Cornelia followed suit... `
`After that, only Maria and Sakutarou were left in the lonely Golden Land... `
`"......Uryuu-..." `
`"...Beato...is a witch..." `
`"Uryu... `
`Beato is a witch..." `
`"It was magic... `
`...*hic*... `
`...it was magic..." `
`"It was magic... Beato used magic to give you candy... `
`You don't need to doubt that... `
`...Uryuu-...! `
`Please believe in Beato... `
`You know that magic can't bear fruit unless you believe..." `
`"Uuuuu...uuuuuuuuuuwaaaaaaaaahhhh..." `
`Surrounded by an ice-cold drizzle that had started falling at some point, `
`...Maria cried quietly... `
`Trying to at least protect her from the rain, Sakutarou used his large sleeves to cover Maria's head... `
`and stayed there by her side... `
`"Okay, let's go, Maria...! `
`Let's play cards together in the room upstairs..." `
`"...Erika-san, `
`as an adult, I can't say I was very impressed by that conversation just now." `
`"My apologies. `
`I'm still just a kid, after all." `
`"...*hic*, ......*hic*..." `
`After seeing that wonderful candy magic brutally insulted by Erika, `
`...Maria had been crying non-stop... `
`"*sigh*... `
`...I started noticing it as soon as the after-dinner quiz party, `
`but your personality really is screwed up. `
`...Do you think this is fun?! `
`Do you like tearing a little kid's dreams apart?" `
`"P-Please stop, Battler-sama...! `
`Please, for my sake, don't push any further here...! `
`Please...!" `
`Shannon, who had been looking flustered, bowed her head deeply and implored Battler to stop. `
`George, who didn't want Shannon pressured, fell in line. `
`"Let's go. `
`Let's spend this year in the cousin room again. `
`We can watch TV and play cards." `
`"...I've heard that Erika-san has her own room. `
`Shannon, please guide her there." `
`"Oh, no need to bother yet. `
`I'll relax down here for a little while longer. `
`I want to savor it a bit." `
`"...What the hell are you trying to savor... `
`...hmph." `
`Battler and the others could no longer hide their irritation. `
`They had no obligation to entertain their uninvited guest any further than this. `
`Erika herself understood perfectly well that no place would welcome a detective. `
`Battler and the others wanted to leave, and Erika wanted to stay. `
`Neither had any desire to stop the other. `
`Jessica urged Maria, who was still crying, to come along... `
`Then, Maria stopped and spun around. `
`"......Got a problem?" `
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!! `
`They do exist here and there, ...Humans who are practically lumps of the toxin and don't believe in magic! `
`There were lots of boys like you in my class!" `
`"They don't believe in witches, or magic, or miracles, or happiness! `
`You can't become a witch if you let the toxin of people like that burn you to ashes! `
`I may not look it, but I'm Beatrice's disciple! `
`I'm the Apprentice Witch of Origins! `
`Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!!!" `
`Maria, who had been crying quietly a second ago, seemed to have been transformed into an entirely different person. `
`...She laughed...no, cackled eerily. `
`Battler's group stiffened up at this sudden change, but Erika was watching calmly. `
`Then, she smiled and gave a small nod in response. `
`"<Good>. `
`...You've got some guts. `
`Goodnight, <Miss> {f:5:Maria}. `
`Let's fight in a more challenging game next time." `
`"Sure, let's. It's a promise. `
`...Kihihihihihihihihihihihi." `
`"Y-You stop that too, Maria...! `
`Come on, let's go." `
`"What about you, Shannon-chan? `
`Come with us, if you want. To play cards." `
`"Come on, join us for at least one round. `
`It'll cheer you up." `
`"Uh, ...ah...th-then, just for a bit..." `
`Shannon couldn't remain in this suffocating lounge any longer either. `
`In part apologetic and in part trying to escape, she followed after Battler's group... `
`After that, Erika was the only one left in the lounge... `
`Still wearing a thin smile, she tapped a glass with her finger. `
`There was a light *chink*. `
`...A surprisingly boring sound. `
`Even so, Erika wore a thin smile, as though pleased... `
`"Hohoho, sorry to keep you waiting. `
`I was just in the bath... `
`...Oh, where is everyone?" `
`"...You just missed them. `
`They went up to the second floor. `
`I'm the one who called you here. `
`...I've heard that you know a lot about the story of Akujikishima and the tale of the witch of the forest." `
`"Yes, well. `
`Hohoho. `
`It is a trivial story, but..." `
`"I don't mind in the slightest if it's trivial. `
`Would you like a drink to follow your bath? `
`...Even I like to be helpful every now and then." `
`Erika stood up, opened the refrigerator behind the counter, and put ice into the ice pail... `
