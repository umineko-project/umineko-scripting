`"...So, `
`how is it, playing on the witch's side?" `
`"It feels strange. `
`......I used to think that the witch's side had such a huge advantage. `
`But now that I'm on that side, I see that that's ridiculous. `
`It's almost like that game where you stick knives in a barrel and try not to stab the mustache guy inside." `
`From the perspective of the human side, it feels like trying to shoot at a target hidden by mist. `
`But from the witch's viewpoint, a stray shot might hit and become fatal. `
`"...The old 'me' played games like that all the time." `
`"Yeah, it's almost like Russian Roulette. `
`...Even so, you believed that I'd eventually notice, and stretched those games out to the limit." `
`"...It may be impudent of me to ask, `
`...but just what is it that you noticed, Battler-san? `
`At the very end of your games with the old 'me'..." `
`It was a strange question. `
`Even though, in the past, Beato had always been the one posing it to Battler... `
`Now that Battler had figured it out, Beato was the one asking it to him... `
`"...Our roles have been completely flipped, haven't they? `
`...In the past, only you remembered, ...and only I forgot. `
`But this time, it's the other way around. `
`Only I remember, ...and only you have forgotten." `
`"Would you mind telling me what it is...?" `
`"......Telling you would be...easy. `
`...But I don't want to tell you. `
`I'm not trying to be mean. `
`...I just want...to believe in a miracle for a bit myself." `
`"......A miracle...?" `
`Yes, this was the single miraculous seed that Battler had left behind. `
`...If Beato could remember a certain something without being told, `
`...that would prove that Beato had truly revived. `
`So he wouldn't tell her. `
`...It was Battler's final seed, `
`...which existed because he still couldn't abandon his hopes for Beato's revival. `
`"If you can't tell me, then I won't ask. `
`...If I have displeased you, please forgive me..." `
`"Don't worry about it. `
`I just never know when to give up. `
`........." `
`As she watched that sad smile, Beato's chest tightened. `
`...He was looking at her...and seeing the old her. `
`Yes, ...I must become my former self...for his sake. `
`My older sister who gets burned by spiderwebs, and I who don't, must become one. `
`...Surely, it's more useful to him if I go on a journey to find myself now... `
`...than if I simply watch over his game. `
`"How do you feel about this game? `
`...Do you think you can win?" `
`"I intend to win. `
`I'll win...and end this eternal torture, just like Beato wanted." `
`"When it ends, ......what will happen to the world...?" `
`"Who knows. `
`...I wonder. `
`...However, that's what we wished for. `
`...So, no matter what the result is, I'll accept it." `
`"......What will happen to me...?" `
`Beato was...uncertain. `
`Even she was probably no more than a piece in this game. `
`...If the game ended, `
`then would she, one who had been born out of that game's rules, ...disappear...? `
`"The game will probably disappear. `
`...But now, I completely understand magic. `
`...So, I'll be able to carry you off the game board. `
`...I think that was your wish." `
`"My...wish...?" `
`".........! `
`...The rest is a secret. `
`...I'll be waiting for a miracle, ...for you to remember all of that on your own." `
`After smiling bitterly for just a second, Battler laughed and told her not to worry. `
`Apparently, it was best if she avoided talking to Battler about her previous self... `
`"...Well then, I'll go check on my opponent for a bit. `
`...I can't wait to see what kind of twisted logic that idiot thinks up next." `
`"The old Battler-san did a lot of that too. `
`...My favorite was the one from the first twilight of the 2nd game, when you said the culprit killed everyone by feeding them small bombs." `
`"Aaaaahhh, the highlights of my dark past... `
`Please forget that ever happened, as fast as you can..." `
`"Yes, I will try." `
`Battler became a cloud of gold butterflies and disappeared into the darkness. `
`Beato kept bowing until he disappeared completely... `
`To fill in his place, a single gold butterfly appeared...and became Beato the Elder. `
`"...Did you call for me, little sister?" `
`"Yes. `
`......I want to know more about you. `
`And...I want to know what the real me is like. `
`I want to become like that." `
`"Of course, I also want to know about my future self. `
`...Didn't we reveal everything about ourselves to each other for that purpose? `
`...However, we did not become one. `
`I cannot understand what we must do to become our single self." `
`"......What can we do to become one...?" `
`"I have high hopes for the trials of Zepar and Furfur." `
`"You mean the miracle of magic given to the victors?" `
`"I wonder if that magical miracle means becoming one. `
`...I will find my true form. `
`You will fulfill Battler's wishes. `
`Battler will be overjoyed too, so all three of us will have what we want." `
`"...This is a trial, right...?" `
`"It means we cannot lose to the other two pairs." `
`"...George-san and Shannon-san, Jessica-san and Kanon-san. `
`...I can only grasp happiness...by trampling over them..." `
`"The conditions apply to all of us. `
`...If one of the others succeeds in love, the other two groups, including you, will be trampled over." `
`"...Why must the scales be so tilted, I wonder?" `
`"Tilted?" `
`"Some people will find love, others won't. `
`...In that case, you can put those two groups on a scale. `
`However, the scales for our trial have three plates, and two must lose for one to win. That seems horribly skewed..." `
`"Who knows? `
`It might mean that successful love is worth two destroyed loves. `
`...You're too insecure, little sister. `
`If you can't put your desire to answer to Battler's expectations before your uncertainty over what happens to the losers, you won't be able to win anything." `
`"......You're right. `
`...I won't give up our victory. `
`...I don't like doing this to the others, ...but there will be no hard feelings between us and them." `
`If I do lose... `
`...I'll give my strongest blessings to whichever of the lovers wins. `
`So, I'll fight with all my heart and soul, `
`...so that I have no lingering regrets, `
`...and I'll win that miracle of magic. `
`"How was it? `
`How did the red and blue shootout over the first twilight go?" `
`"We started by testing the waters. `
`Battler seemed pretty eager too." `
`She had just come back from a fierce fight with Battler, where she had gathered information by making demands for the red text. `
`It was the old, familiar kind of fight, reminiscent of when the red text had first appeared, `
`or when use of the blue text was first permitted... `
`"And the result...?" `
`"First, in all cases, it was the victims themselves that constructed the closed rooms. `
`Also, those closed rooms were perfectly preserved until Krauss's group broke them open. `
`Also, I confirmed that during this period, all sorts of interference from the outside were impossible." `
`Erika reported this proudly as though it had been a great battle, but Bernkastel looked bored as she listened. `
`After looking at her blankly for a second, Lambdadelta spoke her opinions frankly. `
`"......Wait a second. `
`Doesn't that mean this closed room murder was perfect?" `
`"Wha...uh..." `
`The victims had sealed the closed rooms themselves. `
`And, the closed rooms had been preserved until Krauss and the others broke them open. `
`And, no one had been inside the closed rooms except for the victims. `
`And, Krauss's group, the ones who had broken the rooms open, were not the culprits... `
`...In this way, she had managed to win several little red truths like these. `
`Normally, simply collecting such vital information would have been enough. `
`However, the master witch, tired with boredom, `
`...had expected a much more flashy, argument-winning victory instead of this bland result. `
`"H-However, ...this time, I don't have the detective's authority, so there's a chance I messed up when examining the corpses. `
`S-So, if we suppose that a drug that mimics death was used to fool my examination, umm..." `
`"You mean Purupuru Pikopuyo?" `
`"N-No, not that...! `
`It's not impossible for certain well-known drugs, such as insulin, to bring about a temporary state that mimics death. `
`...Battler did not counter that with the red truth. `
`In other words, my blue truth worked...! `
`I-I think we've started with a victory." `
`To sum up Erika's report, `
`all she had done was listen to the red truths Battler had wanted her to hear. `
`Only the information Battler had wanted out there had been shown, and she hadn't been able to strike at any weak points. `
`She was like a kid who had gone out shopping, then forgotten her job and only bought candy... `
`......However, this was all the players on the Human side could do. `
`Without the detective proclamation, she could only fight by collecting dull bits of information like that. `
`...However, her master had been expecting more than that sort of dull fight... `
`So, ...she had tried to give her report energetically, ...to make it seem as though they were in a superior position... `
`But no matter how much she tried, the cold expression of her master remained merciless... `
`"...Your blue truth worked...? `
`If he didn't cut it down, it's probably just because it was too stupid. `
`...You call yourself a great detective with reasoning like that...?" `
`"I-I did try to examine the corpses with care, to the best of my abilities... `
`...However, I don't have the detective's authority, ...so we can't be certain..." `
`"Wait a second, weren't you the one who decided not to make the detective proclamation? `
`Didn't you say you wanted to raise the stakes to make up for your disgrace last time?" `
`"...W-Well......" `
`"What's wrong? `
`...Are you saying you can't win against Battler without the detective's authority...?" `
`"...Th-That's not true, my master. `
`...I-I could easily defeat an incompetent like that, even without the detective's authority... `
`...It's just...this style of fighting is a little different from what I'm used to, and I haven't gotten the hang of it yet..." `
`As far as humans go, Erika was quite talented. `
`Her knowledge and powers of memory and insight were ahead of the pack, and it was likely that no human was more well-suited as a detective than her. `
`However, no matter how much of an advantage she might have had over other people... `
`...That didn't matter in the witch's game. `
`In the witch's game, it's either 0 or 100. `
`In other words, everything is either the red truth, or it isn't. `
`If a normal human was worth a 10, her exceptional power would probably rate a 99. `
`...However, it could never be 100. `
`Since it wasn't 100, it couldn't be absolutely certain. `
`So it didn't count as red truth. `
`For example, ...the examination of the corpses that Erika had worried over in the fight just now. `
`If she had performed it with the detective's authority, she could've said with 100% certainty whether they were alive or dead. `
`However, without the detective proclamation, it was 99%. `
`...There was a 1% chance that she'd made a mistake, and that overturned the foundation of the examination. `
`Erika had gained the detective's authority and had become the Witch of Truth `
`because Bernkastel had supplemented her talent of 99 with an additional 1... `
`Simply because Bernkastel wouldn't give her that 1, `
`...in the world of witches, Erika's 99 was treated exactly the same as zero... `
`She couldn't even use her great assistant Dlanor without a power of 100. `
`When working under an Erika who had lost the detective's authority, Dlanor's red longsword lost its power. `
`Dlanor was also irritated that she couldn't provide full assistance... `
`...She had tried several times to convince Erika to use the detective proclamation, but Erika had stubbornly refused each time... `
`"Why not just do it? Make that detective proclamation. `
`If you do, you'll be unstoppable. `
`Dlanor could even use her red longsword and the Knox Decalogue." `
`"......Why not do it, ...if you want...?" `
`"...N-No." `
`There was no need for anyone to explain... `
`By now, it was clear that Erika hadn't abandoned the detective proclamation by her own will. `
`"...When Battler reached the truth during the previous round, `
`...this game was already finished. `
`This isn't really the 6th game. `
`...It's just a finale, so that Battler can have a chance to serve as Game Master at the end. `
`The result was already decided last game." `
`"Yeah, pretty much. `
`The games won't continue forever, and I've lost my bet with Bern. `
`......In this game, Battler will prove that he's reached the game's truth, `
`and then Beato's game will be destroyed in a big victory for the Human side. `
`And a big victory for Bern too. `
`...Well, supposedly, but you look unsatisfied for some reason." `
`"......Yeah, I'm not satisfied. `
`I didn't want such a boring victory." `
`"The victory you did want had Beato's game board being torn to bits... `
`and Beato's true, pathetic form exposed, humiliated, and trampled on. `
`...But this victory of Battler's isn't quite like that, is it...?" `
`"...All this about love...and promises. `
`...He wants to end the game quietly and let her sleep in peace? `
`...That sort of ending would make anyone vomit." `
`"I didn't give Battler all that advice so that he could end things like that. `
`...I had his little sister turned to scrap meat behind his back. `
`I had his parents and family killed horribly over and over again. `
`That was all to spark a desire for revenge against Beato." `
`"And now, ......what kind of ending is this...? `
`Have I won? `
`Of course not! ...Battler's gotten his hands on a victory that neither you nor I can stand. `
`...I had to withstand a staggering period of boredom just to come all the way out to this backwoods territory, `
`just so that I could see Beatrice lamely and pathetically torn to little bits. `
`I didn't come here to sip from a rotten yogurt Fragment like this!" `
`"Aw, your angry face is wonderful too, Bern. `
`...I see, so this is why you wanted to straighten things out for yourself at least once at the end." `
`"It's all the fault of this moron piece screwing up all the time in the last game! `
`Because of you, this game board that looked like it'd be fun for the first time in thousands of years... `
`has all been... `
`wasted...!! `
`Filth, `
`trash, `
`scum!!" `
`"...M-My apologies, ...my master... `
`...I will definitely...bring you a victory, ...so please forgive me..." `
`"If you couldn't win with the detective's authority in the last game, `
`how do you expect to defeat Battler now that he's the Game Master...? `
`You don't have a chance at winning even with the detective's authority. `
`...So why bother with it?" `
`"I...uh..." `
`"True, if you can't win anyway, then the detective proclamation isn't necessary. `
`The lack will just make your loss all the more certain." `
`"And therefore, if you manage to win in this even worse situation, `
`...that would be a miracle worthy of me. `
`If and only if you can do that, I'll be able to forgive you." `
`"Y-Yes. `
`...I will surely...show you that miracle...!" `
`"Like `
`hell you can, scum." `
`"All you can do is thoroughly expose your wretched self in a horrible punishment game, `
`with your only weapon taken away from you, `
`and through it all, you'll still roll over playfully `
`and beg to keep me entertained, scum." `
`"...Uu..." `
`{a:c: `
`"...Sounds like you're having fun. `
`Am I getting in the way?"} `
`Gold butterflies gathered in the darkness and took the shape of Battler. `
`Though he had just arrived, he seemed to know that the mood was dark. `
`"...Ah, Battler. `
`I had a look at your first twilight. `
`Quite impressive closed rooms. `
`I'm sure you're even more talented than Beato." `
`"It's just a rehash of the closed rooms Beato made in the past. `
`I'll take that to be a compliment for Beato." `
`"It seems your fight with Erika wasn't bad either. `
`Think your serial murders will move along smoothly?" `
`"...Who knows? `
`My role isn't to carry out serial murders. `
`It's to use that process to show you closed rooms that are impossible without magic, `
`and thereby achieve victory for the witch side and prove that I've fully understood this game. `
`...No, there's one more thing." `
`"What...?" `
`"To settle things with Erika, after that evenly matched duel we acted out last time." `
`"...Battler..." `
`"Even...ly...matched...?" `
`Bernkastel noticeably grimaced. `
`Erika averted her eyes and hung her head, timidly... `
`"I know what you'd like to say. `
`That wasn't a draw, `
`we should have won easily, so it counts as a loss." `
`"Hey, `
`it's not polite to eavesdrop." `
`"...Look at a mirror. `
`It's written all over your faces." `
`"No way...! `
`Where?! `
`Hey, what's going on?! `
`If you tell me it's written in ink only morons can't see, then death, death, super death for you!!" `
`Lambdadelta pulled a mirror out of thin air, then looked at it and jumped around angrily. `
`She was apparently pretending to be stupid in her own, special way. `
`"......Erika." `
`"...Wh-What is it?" `
`"That final, fierce attack you and Dlanor made in the last game...was spectacular." `
`"......Th-Thanks." `
`"What happened to Dlanor this time? `
`Are you by yourself?" `
`"......{f:5:No}. `
`...I have been waiting {f:5:here}." `
`Dlanor had been just standing around in reserve, `
`hiding her presence in the dark shadows... `
`"Well, when she can't use her red longsword, Dlanor is just useless scum. `
`There's no point having her around, so she's hanging back." `
`"......All I can do now is record Lady Erika's {f:5:reasoning}." `
`"Why won't you fight with her? `
`Why can't you use that red longsword? `
`...Erika's reasoning...and your longsword. `
`Those were strong because they worked together." `
`"........." `
`Dlanor didn't answer. `
`She just glanced at Bernkastel's expression for an instant. `
`...However, that glance was the same as a clear answer to Battler now. `
`Battler fully recognized the situation... `
`"You. `
`You're the one who told Erika not to use the detective proclamation." `
`"...Oho, I don't know what you're talking about." `
`"This fight is between me and Erika. `
`......We're gonna fight with all we've got. `
`That way, we'll be able to accept it whether we win or lose. `
`There's no need for a mastermind behind the scenes like you." `
`"...Come now, I'm no mastermind. `
`I'm just a theatergoer trying to relieve her boredom." `
`"A theatergoer is someone who sits quietly in the stands and watches. `
`That's not what we call someone who jeers at the stage and threatens or manipulates the performers." `
`"Sorry for being an ill-mannered audience. `
`...You might not know it, but I've already paid a huge admission fee to watch this play. `
`Sorry, but I intend to enjoy it until I get my money's worth." `
`"If you get in the way of the game's progression, I can use my authority as the Game Master to boot you out of this game." `
`"If you want to, go ahead. `
`If you chase me out, then I'll head back with my piece, Erika. `
`This game will be cancelled, and you won't be able to prove that you've reached the truth. `
`...A theatergoer is an observer. `
`A truth with no observers is the same as an illusion. `
`...You need a theatergoer as a witness until Beato's game ends." `
`"...Our truth only needs to pass between the two of us! `
`If you get in the way any further, I will boot you out by force. `
`...Then you can writhe around in boredom for a few centuries until you find another way to kill time." `
`"Then go ahead and do that! `
`Erika, this game is over! Good work. `
`...You were completely useless. `
`You weren't able to overturn the dishonor of your loss, so as promised, I'll throw you into the worst Fragment, `
`I'll toss you into the depths of oblivion with the empty popcorn buckets!!" `
`"...M-My master...! `
`I will...I will win, ...I'll win no matter what...!! `
`So please, ...let me fight Battler until the end...!! `
`I don't...want to lose...and get thrown in the d-depths of oblivion... `
`...*hic*...*hic*..." `
`"...You know I want to watch until the end, right? `
`...But Battler says he'll toss me out. `
`Hey, what'll you do, Lambda?!" `
`"Well, ...I realize you've been irritated since the last game, Bern, but calm down a bit. `
`...And Battler, don't provoke Bern so much. `
`This kid can't control her emotions sometimes." `
`"Shut up... `
`Who can't control her emotions...?!" `
`Bernkastel, who had never showed any expressions at all at one point in time, `
`was now twisting her face into all kinds of displeased and ugly shapes. `
`When Lambdadelta made fun of that, `
`Bernkastel clicked her tongue and looked away. `
`As they say, nothing can stop poison but poison. `
`...Apparently, Lambdadelta was the only one who could rein Bernkastel in. `
`"...Erika, you want to fight Battler, clear your name, and get Bern back into a good mood, right?" `
`"...Y-Yes..." `
`"Battler, you want to quickly and neatly end this 'final game' `
`so that you can prove that you've found the truth, right?" `
`"...Yeah. `
`This is a face-off between me and Erika. `
`I won't let anyone get in my way, `
`but I won't let anyone get in Erika's way either." `
`"...B-Battler......" `
`"If both of them wish to fight, then that should be respected. `
`...Leave Bern to me. `
`I'm the only one in the world who can calm that kid when she gets in a bad mood." `
`"...You're the same sort as her, ...but at least you can be reasoned with." `
`"...... `
`...You shouldn't underestimate me. `
`I just like seeing Bern grimace. `
`That's why I've taken a liking to this game of yours. `
`...If you think I'm easy to handle, you're apt to get burned, okay...?" `
`"......Hmph." `
`"Dlanor can't use her red longsword because the detective proclamation hasn't been made. `
`If Erika makes it, she'll regain her power right away. Right?" `
`"...{f:5:Yes}. `
`When that happens, forgive {f:5:me}." `
`"Erika." `
`"What...?" `
`"Make the detective proclamation." `
`"...... `
`...No." `
`"Do you really think you can beat me as I am now without the detective's authority?" `
`"...I-I can win..." `
`"...Lord {f:5:Battler}, `
`...Lady Erika is herself a {f:5:piece}. `
`She cannot disobey her master's {f:5:orders}. `
`All she can do is gather the power she has...and fight for {f:5:survival}." `
`"And Dlanor, your power can't be used at all without the detective proclamation?" `
`"......I need permission before unsheathing the 'red {f:5:key}'. `
`One form of that permission is the detective {f:5:proclamation}." `
`"Are there any other ways of getting that permission?" `
`"...Wh-What are you saying...?! `
`I-If you're doing this out of pity for me, that's none of your business!" `
`"Quiet. `
`You're so flimsy by yourself that it's boring. `
`Be quiet, detective who isn't a detective." `
`"...Gah..." `
`"The 'red key' is infinitely similar to the red {f:5:truth}. `
`...If and only if I am given a 'truth', I am permitted to draw my sword for items that pertain to {f:5:it}." `
`"What do you mean by a 'truth'...?" `
`"......... `
`...For example, ...there are Lady Erika's packing tape {f:5:seals}." `
`"Ah, ...those." `
`"Lady Bernkastel has already acknowledged that those seals are equivalent in value to the red {f:5:truth}. `
`Therefore, I am permitted to draw the red key, at least for truths pertaining to those {f:5:seals}." `
`"Those caused me a lot of trouble last time, `
`so I had all the sticky packing tape removed from the game board this time around." `
`"...A splendid {f:5:move}." `
`"......Erika was proud to be able to call herself the detective, wasn't she?" `
`"{f:5:Yes}... `
`...Though her only goal was to irresponsibly solve riddles, ...it was a matter of pride for {f:5:her}." `
`"Then she must really be suffering now that she can't make that proclamation." `
`"......Only she could tell you {f:5:that}." `
`"........." `
`Battler took a deep breath, then hung his head in thought for a time. `
`...Erika was his enemy, `
`but she was the player on the Human side, and without her, there would be no game. `
`It had been the same with the old Beato. `
`Battler had one-sidedly viewed Beato as an enemy. `
`However, though Beato had thought of him as her opponent, she hadn't considered him an enemy on a personal level. `
`...In accordance with the rules, I must fight my rival ruthlessly. `
`However, that doesn't mean I need to hate Erika herself. `
`......... `
`...I won't {i:misunderstand} Beato's game. `
`"Erika, `
`you're free to choose not to make a detective proclamation. `
`In that case, go and fight just with your power as a Human." `
`"I've been prepared to do that from the start...!" `
`"However, you have talented allies. `
`...Dlanor, ...Gertrude, and Cornelia. `
`You aren't alone. `
`You have allies." `
`"Yeah, but they're unreliable, powerless, and useless scum." `
`"Dlanor, `
`...just like how I was supported by Virgilia and Ronove in the past, Erika needs support as well. `
`I know from repeated experience that playing for the Human side is tough." `
`"...{f:5:Yes}. `
`I will assist her with all the power I {f:5:possess}." `
`"Understood." `
`"Know that it is our job." `
`"Hmph. `
`And you can't even use the red truth!" `
`"Erika, `
`...I will give power, not to you, but to your allies." `
`"Huh?! `
`Wh-What do you think you're doing...?! `
`I'd rather die than receive your pity!!" `
`"Three people: Dlanor, Gertrude, and Cornelia. `
`...Erika, `
`I'll let you use three rooms' worth of those packing tape seals." `
`To fully seal one room, multiple seals would be needed to cover all the doors and windows. `
`If he had said three seals, it would only have been possible to fully seal one room at best. `
`So, Battler was generous and limited them by room instead of by seal... `
`"...Lord {f:5:Battler}..." `
`"As the Game Master, I also acknowledge that these seals have the same effect as the red truth. `
`...This way, you'll also be able to wield that red longsword in a fight surrounding those. `
`Right...?" `
`"...{f:5:Yes}... `
`...But...are you {f:5:certain}?" `
`"Winning against Erika when she's less than a detective is hardly a victory. `
`If Erika's upping the stakes, then I should have the right to do the same." `
`"Whew, what a man! `
`Aren't you lucky, Erika?! `
`Now you can use a bit of red without making the detective proclamation and irritating your master." `
`"......Y-You'll regret this... `
`...I'll use these three seals...and kill you, ...no matter what...!" `
`"Perfect. `
`Come to kill me." `
`"...Gah...nnnn..." `
`Though it was only for three rooms, it was a red truth that Erika had desperately wanted. `
`Now, she finally had enough leeway to fight as she pleased. `
`...She ground her teeth at being pitied by Battler, but her tears were not those of shame. `
`"...{f:5:Understood}. `
`Three rooms' worth of packing tape seals, {f:5:accepted}. `
`...Regarding this matter, ...should we consider them as being accepted retroactively, back when Lady Erika received the non-sticky packing tape from <Mrs> Kumasawa?" `
`Erika had borrowed packing tape from Kumasawa to make seals with. `
`However, Battler had made it so that those weren't sticky... `
`If he ruled that there had never been any problem with the stickiness of that packing tape, the transition could be made smoothly. `
`"Sure, that's fine. `
`...I'll rewrite the tale. `
`...The packing tape that Erika received from Kumasawa-san late at night on the first day was sticky, `
`but there was only enough left to use on three rooms. `
`...I'll apply that from here on out." `
`"{f:5:Understood}. `
`...Lady Erika will also retroactively adjust her movements, starting before the discovery of the first twilight, and taking into account that the application of this privilege is now {f:5:possible}. `
`...As soon as these changes affect the progression of the game, they will be reported to the Game {f:5:Master}." `
`"...Letting you do it retroactively, even though you know which rooms the crime will occur in... `
`...That gives you a pretty big advantage. `
`You won't have to waste tape on other rooms." `
`"It seems you've grown quite arrogant since becoming Game Master. `
`Isn't it fun `
`to give out charity to your pathetic opponents?" `
`"Quiet. `
`And don't misunderstand. `
`...I'm not being arrogant or soft here. `
`......Erika, use this weapon and come at me with all you've got. `
`Then I'll crush you with all I've got. `
`So, hold your head up high and use those three. `
`That is all." `
`Battler made to leave the room with a flick of his cape. `
`As he did, he thought he heard Erika let out a strained voice calling him to a stop. `
`"...... `
`...What is it?" `
`"........." `
`"If you have no business with me, I'm going. `
`Make sure you talk with Dlanor. `
`Don't listen to those obnoxious witches, whatever they tell you. `
`As long as I'm on this game board, I won't let them do whatever they please." `
`"...Th-Thank you...uu..." `
`"........." `
`"...Thank you... `
`...I'll...fight with all I've got... `
`I'll come at you with all my strength, ...so...I'll defeat you no matter what... `
`...So, if you do win against me, `
`...please crush me with all your strength. `
`*hic*... `
`...Please...don't leave...a scrap behind... `
`...*hic*...!" `
`"...... `
`...Understood. `
`...And don't you go easy on me. `
`...This is the final game. `
`I'm playing to prove to Beato that I've reached the truth. `
`...By now, who wins and who loses doesn't affect that goal. `
`So, I just want to accept you as a rival and settle this. `
`......In the game, let's suspect each other over everything as enemies. `
`But as fellow players, let's trust each other. `
`...That's how this game is supposed to be played." `
`"...Yes... `
`...Thank you... `
`...Thank you...uuuuuu..." `
`Battler melted into the darkness, became a cloud of gold butterflies, and vanished... `
`Erika remained behind, sobbing... `
`...Uuuuu...*hic*... `
`Just `
`kidding~ `
`"Jeez you're a dim, stupid man. `
`...You totally fell for it and gave me the tape... `
`...I...Furudo Erika... `
`...have packing tape...!!" `
`It was hard to imagine that the person who had been sobbing pathetically and this person now were the same. `
`...That's how vile her face contorted to be... `
`The two witches were also cackling with ugly smiles... `
`"I totally understand. `
`When you become Game Master, it feels like you've become God and you get all sure of yourself." `
`"......It was the same for you, Lambda. `
`...Of course you'd lose after leaving a stupid mistake like walking corpses alone. `
`...Stupid Game Masters, stupid mistakes, stupid pride, stupid losses, stupid Battler, stupid everything. `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!" `
`"Stupid losses, stupid Battler, stupid everything. `
`Ahahahahaha, has a nice ring to it. `
`Nice one, my master. `
`*giggle*giggle*! `
`Stupid Battler, stupid everything, stupid Battler, stupid everything." `
`"If that stupid Battler really thinks Erika's at a disadvantage, then I really pity him. `
`...A detective proclamation isn't what you need to kill a moron." `
`"Death by falling on a piece of tofu?" `
`"It'd have to be soft tofu too." `
`"Add some gochujang chili paste and you've got a snack that'd go great with some wine. `
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*!" `
`The three giggled together... `
`It had all been an act to get the packing tape for the seals from Battler... `
`Even though the packing tape that had tormented him so much in the last game was unusable in this one, `
`...he had fallen for Erika's act, `
`...and she had gotten what she wanted, though just three rooms' worth. `
`The illusion that Erika had an overwhelming disadvantage was just an act. `
`...A trap to trick Battler and make him hand over the packing tape. `
`"With this, I can kill Battler perfectly...! `
`I figured out those pathetic closed rooms long ago...! `
`A perfect closed room? `
`Dumbaaaaaaaaaaaaass!! `
`I'll show you a real perfect closed room! `
`And I could almost cry for joy at the fact that you gave me the weapon that'll finish you...! `
`My master, Lady Lambdadelta...! `
`Thank you so much for going along with this act!" `
`"It was fun. `
`No need to thank me." `
`"...Plus, it wasn't an act. `
`*giggle*giggle*" `
`Bernkastel said something that was probably disturbing, but in her good mood, Erika didn't care a bit. `
`That pudding-for-brains moron, thinking he's done something so noble! `
`I'll make you regret it, hihihihi!! `
`"All right! `
`Let's use these seals at our leisure...! `
`You did great too, Dlanor. `
`It seems that Battler trusts you, so he believed every word you said." `
`"........." `
`"Don't tell me your conscience is hurting. `
`You little murder doll." `
`"......{f:5:No}." `
`Dlanor looked at Erika in a slightly lonely way. `
`...Then, after shaking her head slightly, her gaze turned hard, and she looked at the darkness Battler had disappeared into. `
`"...He should have known that this was a no-holds-barred {f:5:fight}... `
`...How foolish, Lord {f:5:Battler}. `
`This is, without a doubt, the result of your {f:5:pride}." `
`......<Mr> Battler, ...this will be {f:5:fatal}... `
`"So far so good, Furfur?!" `
`"Yeah, all of the lovers clearly possess a strong will!" `
`""This is a victory for love...! `
`That, we shall extol!!"" `
`...Everyone had gotten used to these two overdramatic demons. `
`George spoke quietly with an annoyed expression. `
`"We'll only extol that after we've passed your trial and someone has been given the miracle of magic." `
`"I agree... `
`...We've all passed the first trial. `
`What's next? `
`...I won't hold back anymore... I'll do whatever it takes..." `
`"...Yes. We won't lose." `
`"We won't lose either." `
`"Yeah. `
`...And of course, the same goes for Battler-kun's group." `
`"......Of course. `
`I doubt anyone here is so naive that they hope to win by having the others forfeit." `
`"Right... `
`...Anyone weak enough to drop out would have no right to be here right now." `
`Even Beato, who seemed to be the shakiest one of the six, was strongly determined. `
`The two demons nodded at each other, taking note of the six's continued resolve. `
`"So, what's the next trial? `
`Don't tell me you still haven't decided..." `
`"Well, we thought at least some of you would drop out." `
`"We didn't think you'd all remain. `
`What a happy miraculous miscalculation due to love!" `
`"Shut up. `
`...So? `
`Are we going to play musical chairs or something to make sure someone drops out?" `
`""Yes, precisely that!"" `
`"We've decided to have this trial eliminate one group no matter what!" `
`"This trial is the second twilight of the epitaph-" `
`""'Tear apart the two who are close!!' `
`Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!"" `
`"...I don't get it." `
`"Zepar-sama, Furfur-sama, ...what sort of trial is this? `
`...Do you mean we're going to kill each other...?" `
`"That'd settle things quickly." `
`"Though it's not exactly civilized." `
`"Love is for carnivores." `
`"...I guess we can't all just find happiness together, can we..." `
`"This is what they call a zero-sum game. `
`It's an economic word, but maybe you've heard of it...?" `
`"N-No, ...my apologies..." `
`"Zero-sum game. It's where victory and losses all cancel out to end up with zero. `
`...In order for someone to win, someone else must be forced to lose. `
`...It's the ruthless way of this world." `
`"......Heh. `
`...If only everyone `
`could be happy. `
`...But there's no way an ideal world like that could exist." `
`"No, there is!" `
`"That is the Golden Land!" `
`"...The Golden Land...? `
`What are you talking about...?" `
`"...That's right. `
`If you reach the Golden Land, ...all love will be satisfied. `
`...However, like heaven and hell, that's not a place in this world." `
`"I wouldn't want that. `
`...Love has meaning because we find it in this world. `
`I could never support a sad lovers' double suicide, where they're only united after death. `
`...I'll stick to my love in life. `
`I won't lose to anyone." `
`"...George-san..." `
`The door to the Golden Land can be opened by solving the epitaph's riddle... `
`In that place, love and lives are all whole and can be revived, but... `
`"We're straying from the point. `
`...Let's hear about the second trial now." `
`"Right. `
`...What are you trying to make us do with this 'tear apart the two who are close' thing...?" `
`"It's quite simple!" `
`"The only possible way to tear apart two lovers is by the sad farewell of death!" `
`"The second trial involves killing one of the six!" `
`"Of course, any lover with their partner killed is disqualified." `
`"In short, one group of lovers must fail during this trial!" `
`"...You say 'kill' so easily. `
`...What exactly are we supposed to do?" `
`"You can just fight to the death-" `
`"Or you can decide by a lottery of some sort." `
`"Like hell we'd choose by drawing lots. `
`Let's have a fair and square duel." `
`"...Though if we do that, I imagine that Battler-kun, the Game Master, and Beatrice, who is the Golden Witch even though her memory is gone, `
`...will have a substantial advantage." `
`"Ah, ...w-well, I wonder about that..." `
`"Don't worry! `
`For this trial, we have made everyone's powers equal." `
`"Even the Game Master, Lord {f:5:Battler}, is taking this trial on an even footing with everyone else." `
`"In that case, ...it's fair..." `
`"Is it completely and purely on an even footing?" `
`""Yes, it's perfectly even! `
`In a one on one matchup, victory would be decided by luck!"" `
`"It's perfectly even-" `
`"So it'll probably take some time before it's settled." `
`"So, is the trick to attack when you're in a superior position, I wonder?" `
`"Duels that take time are, of course, wonderful!" `
`"Why would anyone leave it up to luck? `
`...Of course we wanna fight in a situation to our advantage." `
`"...In that case, ...a three-way struggle...? `
`...Won't that mean we're stuck...?" `
`Beato was the first to notice. `
`If the six were truly on an even footing, and both willing and capable of winning, one pair would have to concentrate their attacks on a single person. `
`If that happened, then the pair containing their target would, of course, band together and resist. `
`In other words, it would never be two against one. `
`It would become two against two, and a matter of luck. `
`However, at that time, any third pair who happened to be watching this... `
`could team up with whichever pair they liked with no risk to themselves, defeating the opposing pair with certainty... `
`"Sounds troublesome. `
`...It means that moving first is disadvantageous." `
`If you step forward and fight, it's a matter of luck. `
`If you sit and wait for the others to start fighting, it's certain victory. `
`...A fight would never begin in this situation... `
`"...Maybe we could just have everyone fight the person next to them one on one. `
`...Then, as soon as one fight is settled, the trial will be over." `
`Unless everyone could abandon any naive hopes for a two on one fight, `
`this trial would never begin and never end. `
`In that case, if they made a gentlemen's agreement and had everyone duel at once, `
`it would be no different from drawing lots, ...but it would at least be even... `
`"That won't work. `
`If we do that, everyone will just defend instead of fighting proactively. `
`All they need to do is wait for someone to lose before they do." `
`Shannon's point was a sound one. `
`If both fighters just glared at each other without attacking, `
`then neither would lose. `
`All they had to do was wait for someone other than themselves to lose first. `
`This brought them back to the starting point. `
`...No one would fight proactively. `
`"In the end, no one will move, and nothing will be resolved..." `
`"...Since there's this arithmetical situation where we all have the same strength, ...it's almost like a puzzle." `
`"True. `
`...It would have been an interesting duel if our strengths were unknown. `
`...However, since we've been told that we're perfectly even, this duel is no different than rock, paper, scissors." `
`"...In that case, ...why not use rock, paper, scissors to decide it...?" `
`"Are you crazy...?! I'm not gonna do that! `
`Even if someone does lose, there's no way they'd accept their loss!" `
`"...If they don't accept it, then they will be attacked by the four winners. `
`...In the world where all are equal, the losers will have no chance of surviving..." `
`"True. `
`...Well now. `
`Is rock, paper, scissors actually the most reasonable way to settle this?" `
`"It's extremely reasonable. `
`However, if you ask me whether I'd be reckless enough to entrust my fate to a random number generator, the answer is no." `
`"Please do consider that problem...!" `
`"This is the second trial we have for you!" `
`""Think, and fight to the death! `
`Please decide who the sacrifice will be!!"" `
