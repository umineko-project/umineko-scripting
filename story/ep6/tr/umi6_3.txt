`......On Rokkenjima, this day—`
`or rather, this time around—`
`was the same as any other.`
`The typhoon would be coming very soon.`
`{n}The clouds hadn't yet grown thick, but they were moving quickly.`
`The only thing on Natsuhi's mind was the plan to cover up Kinzo's absence this year as well.`
`Krauss appeared to have suffered a stomachache from the stress and was resting in his room.`
`Jessica and Kumasawa had left in a boat to go shopping and greet the incoming relatives on Niijima.`
`The servants had been busy since the early morning in preparation for the family conference, the greatest event of the year...`
`Shannon and Kanon were getting the guesthouse ready.`
`"......Shouldn't the guest rooms in the mansion be more than enough to hold the relatives?"`
`"Good point.`
` It is a pain to clean up here as well.`
` ......Even so, I like cleaning the guesthouse."`
`"Yeah, it's nice and quiet without Madam and all the annoying servants."`
`Shannon gave a non‐committal smile as she performed a detailed examination of the guest room.`
`Did we forget to clean anything? Do we need to restock anything?`
`{n}She diligently gave the room one final check over......`
`"You checked everything thoroughly last night too, didn't you?`
` You really are dedicated."`
`"It's on days like this when you tend to get pranked if you're careless.`
` ......You can never find important things when you need them,`
` and things that were supposed to be closed turn out to be open."`
`"That's because you're too careless.`
` You don't pay attention while you work."`
`"I guess that's why you're helping me check.`
` Thanks."`
`"......There's nothing to thank me for.`
` If you were a bit more alert, I wouldn't have to help at all."`
`".........*giggle*.`
` But the truth is, you just want to be with me, right?`
` You're such a kid."`
`"Th‐that's not it at all...`
` It's all because you've been so ecstatic about George‐sama lately.`
` You're messing up so much, I can't let you out of my sight."`
`"*giggle*...`
` ......Kanon‐kun.`
` Let's chat a bit."`
`"......We can't do that now. We're working."`
`"You keep making fun of me and George‐sama,`
` ......but how is it going between you and Jessica‐sama?"`
`"N‐......nothing's going on in particular.`
` If you have time to talk about that, let's just finish this...`
`......wah—"`
`Kanon was—very obviously—trying to change the subject.`
`{n}So Shannon snuck up behind him and pushed him down onto the bed.`
`"Why did you turn down Milady when she asked you to go with her to welcome the relatives?"`
`".........Because I have work to do..."`
`"Liar.`
` ......You don't actually have any work at all."`
`Shannon and Kanon had switched roles.`
`Normally, Kanon was the one in control, but when it came to romance, it was the opposite.`
`As Shannon had said, ......Jessica and Kanon were supposed to have been the ones to go greet the relatives at the Niijima harbor.`
`However, Kanon had suddenly claimed that he had work to do, so Kumasawa had gone instead.`
`Kanon...didn't have any work to do.`
` Shannon knew this...`
`"Milady told me.`
` ......Despite everything that happened after the cultural festival, her feelings for you haven't changed."`
`"............Even though I'm...furniture..."`
`"That's right.`
` And I'm furniture too."`
`"......And yet you're in love with a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` ......Even though that's never going to be possible."`
`"You think so...?`
` ......Maybe thinking that way...`
`...is what makes us furniture."`
`"I don't have any special feelings for Milady Jessica.`
` ......I only think of her as the daughter of the family we serve."`
`"Really...?"`
`"Really."`
`"........................"`
`"......Wh‐......what?"`
`"You know,`
` ............there is a chance...`
`that George‐sama will propose to me tonight."`
`"...............!"`
`Shannon wore an incredibly peaceful smile on her face,`
` ......but Kanon could tell that there was no way she'd let him change the subject.`
`Kanon realized that she must have made him help out here in the guesthouse in order to talk to him about this, and he clicked his tongue softly...`
`"......You really think you can marry a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} even though you're furniture?"`
`"I think I can."`
`"That's impossible."`
`"Why?"`
`"That dream future that George‐sama has imagined for you two...is something you can never give him."`
`"W‐......well......"`
`"......We aren't {y:0:Humans}{n:0:humans}.`
` We're furniture, inferior to them.`
` George‐sama only thinks that you're {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}."`
`"...W‐......well, that is true, but......"`
`"I'm impressed that you've managed to trick him for this long.`
` Do you really think you can keep tricking him like that forever?`
` Even though you still haven't been able to tell him that you're furniture."`
`"......Being furniture or being {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}...has nothing to do with this.`
` ......I believe that George‐sama will accept all of me."`
`"And yet you don't have the courage to check and make sure."`
`"........................`
` ......You know,`
` ......I'm planning on...`
`saying yes."`
`As Shannon looked up at the ceiling, ......she spoke of the imagined future that she and George would create.`
`Though some anxiety over the future appeared on her face,`
` ......so did joy from discovering what it was like to live with love.`
`As Kanon watched this vivid dream he was being shown,`
` ......he knew that none of his words would reach Shannon anymore...`
`"......Hmph.........`
` ...You can just do what you want.`
` ......Once you've said something, you're incredibly stubborn."`
`"Yep.`
` ......I want to live life my own way.`
` ......I've decided to stop worrying...`
`about who's furniture and who's a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}."`
`"........................"`
`Kanon walked over to the window silently.`
`......He saw the rose garden filled with boring, gray flowers in bloom...`
`He understood that Shannon was acting above her place.`
`And he knew that her tale had no chance of a happy ending.`
`......However, he also knew that now Shannon had made her decision,`
` no words of his could change her mind.`
`".........In that case,`
` ......it doesn't matter what I say.`
` ......If I tell you to stop, you won't listen.`
` If I tell you to do what you want, you'll do what you want.`
` ......Why are you talking to me about this?`
` It's not like you care what my response is."`
`"What I want to know...`
`...is how you feel about Milady."`
`"......I have nothing to do with the two of you."`
`"Do you really...`
`...feel absolutely nothing...`
`for Milady?"`
`"......No, I don't, as I keep telling you."`
`"Liar."`
`"Why do you think that's a lie?"`
`"I know.`
` I'm your big sister."`
`"You don't know.`
` You can't know what I'm feeling...!!"`
`"I do.`
` I know everything about you, Kanon‐kun."`
`"If you really do know, then why are you asking?!`
` Your head and heart are already full with your feelings for George‐sama!!`
` And that single‐hearted devotion is what I love about you!!`
` That's why......I'm rooting for you in the only way I can, you know that!!`
` Otherwise, ......even I...!!"`
`"Even I?"`
`"Even I...`
`.........would have loved to fall for Milady...!!!"`
`Kanon finally turned to face her, honestly and openly telling her his real emotions.`
`That was what Shannon had wanted to hear.`
`{n}And having heard it, she closed in even further on Kanon's true feelings.`
`"No, you can't word it that way.`
` I won't let you."`
`"Then what do you want from me?!!`
` What am I supposed to say?!!"`
`"Don't try to dodge by saying "I would have loved to fall for her".`
` All you need to do is honestly tell me what you really feel."`
`"Milady is......too dazzling for me!!`
` The way she lives is blinding like the sun!!`
` That's what I love about her...!`
` I was so happy when Milady stretched out her hand and asked me to walk with her!!`
` No, I still am happy!!"`
`"You love her, don't you?"`
`"Yes, I do!!`
` I love Milady!!"`
`Finally,`
` ......Kanon confessed his feelings in their entirety.`
`In fact, by saying it aloud, he finally understood how he truly felt.`
`As passionate tears welled up in his eyes,`
` ......Kanon finally accepted it...`
`He couldn't stop the tears from dripping down his face.`
`"Milady was exactly like me, locked up on Rokkenjima and living without any hope at all...!`
` And yet, she was able to light her own path and create her own fate...!`
` She was so dazzling that I envied her!!`
` I felt as though, if I could be with her, ......I could find my true self, instead of the pitiful person I am now...!!"`
`"When you turned down Milady's confession,`
` ......were you sad?"`
`"I was!!`
` I never realized that lying to yourself could be so sad, so painful, so excruciating!!`
` And I just couldn't forgive myself for hurting Milady with that lie!!`
` I believed that I didn't have any right to fall in love ever again!!"`
`"But you do.`
` The right to love...`
`is something only you can give yourself.`
` Being furniture or not has nothing to do with it.`
` If you tell yourself "no", then it'll never happen.`
` You mustn't think that way.`
` That's why I gave myself, impudent furniture that I am, the right to fall in love.`
` And you have it too."`
`"The right to fall in love?"`
`"Yes.`
` If you can't give it to yourself, then I will."`
`"Thank you.`
` ......I...`
`feel as though...`
`I can finally...`
`see the sea......"`
`"......I'm certain.`
` Tonight, George‐sama...`
`will propose to me."`
`".............................."`
`"When he does, I will accept.`
` ......I intend to leave this island and start a new life in a new world."`
`"If that's the path you've chosen,`
` ......then I have no say in the matter."`
`"I'll leave this island, ......and I'll never return again.`
` ......It will mean saying farewell to you, Kanon‐kun."`
`"...........................`
` ......You're right.`
` ......We won't......see each other again, will we?"`
`"If...`
`...if you do love Milady from the bottom of your heart, and if you can honestly say that your feelings are at least as strong as the ones I have for George‐san,`
` .........then you and I need to settle this."`
`"......N‐.........nee‐san......"`
`"This way is best for both of us.`
` ..........Don't give up on your feelings on account of me."`
`"Even though my selfishness might keep you from your happiness......?"`
`"I'm fully aware of it.`
` ......My happiness......is hurting you as well."`
`We have no choice but to hurt each other.`
`As she said this, Shannon turned her back to Kanon...`
`As Kanon watched Shannon from behind,`
` ......he was struck by her strength...`
`...and the sisterly love she showed in still thinking of him despite everything.`
`"......Nee‐san.`
` Living with you...made me happy."`
`"Me too.`
` I wouldn't have lasted this long without you.`
` ......And that's why I was able to meet George‐san."`
`"Yeah.`
` And I wouldn't have realized how dazzling Milady is......if it weren't for you."`
`"I won't abandon my emotions.`
` ......I'll focus only on my feelings and ignore everything else, and I won't look away when I trample over your heart."`
`"......Me too. I won't use you as an excuse...`
`...to hide the way I really feel."`
`"Whether my love bears fruit...`
`or yours does,`
` ......let's each agree to celebrate the other."`
`"Yes.`
` ......I promise.`
` And if I win,`
` ......I will love Milady......and treasure you."`
`"Thank you.`
` But if I win,`
` ......I'll forget you and this island and leave this place forever."`
`"Yes.`
` ......Whichever of us wins,`
` that person will pursue their love with all they've got.`
` ......Even if they know that love will be unrequited."`
`"Yes.`
` After all..."`
`{a:c:`
`""We are furniture...no more.""}`
`The boat carrying the relatives docked at Rokkenjima's harbor.`
`They left the boat one by one, making fun of Battler...`
`Gohda wasn't the only one to greet them. Kanon was there too.`
`"It has been quite some time, everyone.`
` Allow me to welcome you to Rokkenjima."`
`"......I hope that your long journey went smoothly.`
` Welcome to Rokkenjima......"`
`"Ah, good, good."`
`Gohda complimented Kanon in a whisper.`
`Kanon ignored this, looking just a little sour, and continued to greet the incoming relatives.`
`"This is your first time meeting Gohda‐san and Kanon‐kun, isn't it, Battler‐kun?"`
`"Uu!`
` It's my first time meeting Battler too!`
` *giggle*giggle*!"`
`"Gohda‐san's a splendid chef.`
` He's the only reason anyone'd ever want to come to this island."`
`"I am most honored.`
` Battler‐sama, I do hope that you look forward to your meals during your stay."`
`"I can't wait...!`
` I'll be looking forward to it!"`
`"It's good to see you again, Kanon‐kun.`
` You seem to be in high spirits today.`
` That's great."`
`"......Y‐you think so...?"`
`"Oh yes. Your face is looking brighter today.`
` I can't tell if it's your complexion or if your gaze looks a bit more gallant."`
`"Hahah, it must be a growing phase.`
` That's how a boy becomes a man."`
`"You usually look as though you're about to pass out from anemia.`
` You're a bit different today."`
`"You've got some vigor.`
` A boy can change a lot in just three days.`
` I guess this means even Kanon‐kun's gettin' a bit more manly!"`
`"We aren't making fun of you, okay?`
` We're all complimenting you. *giggle*"`
`......Kanon had sworn that starting today, he would start changing the way he lived bit by bit.`
`However, he had only meant to change within himself, and hadn't expected that it would show on the outside.`
`He was a bit shocked to hear that his expression had changed so much...`
`that people had apparently noticed as soon as he opened his mouth.`
`No,`
` ......maybe the real surprise should have been that his normal expression looked so incredibly sullen in comparison.`
`Gohda led the way up to the guesthouse.`
`{n}Kanon brought up the rear, helping to carry some of Kumasawa's shopping.`
`"......Does my...face really look that bright today?"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` It looks that way to me as well.`
` ......Did something good happen?`
` *giggle*giggle*."`
`Even Kumasawa was saying it.`
`......Kanon, unable to see what his own face looked like, hung his head in embarrassment.`
`......When they reached the rose garden, they could see the others entering the guesthouse.`
`Then, he saw Jessica running towards him from there.`
`......Is even Milady Jessica going to say that I'm in a good mood today?`
`Kanon hung his head even deeper.`
`And so, almost as though he couldn't control himself, Kanon spoke first.`
`"......Do I really look that different?"`
`"Huh?`
` A...hahahahahaha.`
` ......Well, you know.`
` You aren't usually the type to come out and say hello of your own accord.`
` That's probably why everyone was surprised..."`
`".....................`
` ......I apologize for not going with you earlier, Milady."`
`"Huh?`
` Oh, don't worry about that...`
` I'm the one who's sorry for asking you to come all the way out to Niijima with me just to meet everyone...`
` I know how busy you must be today..."`
`"I......didn't have anything in particular to do.`
` ......You were just so dazzling.`
` ...So dazzling that I couldn't bear to be with you.`
` ......I was just weak."`
`Jessica faltered, uncertain what Kanon was talking about.`
`{n}However, she realized that this was something too important to be laughed off.`
`"......Did something happen, Kanon‐kun...?"`
`"Shannon says...`
`...she's going to get married."`
`".........I see.`
` ...So George nii‐san {i:is} going to propose this year."`
`Jessica thought that this change in Kanon's appearance was probably caused by a change in his state of mind. She thought he was sad that he and Shannon would soon be parting ways.`
`Kanon realized that Jessica was probably thinking this.`
`......So, he spoke to her clearly and honestly.`
` Because he wanted her to know.`
`"I had long decided that if Nee‐san ever quit...`
`I would stop working here as well."`
`"......I know.`
` ...So, are you going to quit too?"`
`"I'm not sure anymore.`
` ......I feel that, if I quit, I might again lose sight of......something that your dazzling sunlight revealed to me."`
`Jessica was stunned, unable to understand what he was saying.`
`......However, she did realize that he was trying to tell her something important.`
`And so, she was able to accept that his next words were neither a lie nor a joke...`
`"Milady Jessica, I...love you."`
`".........I,`
` .........I love you too...!"`
`"You live your life like the sun...and I want to try walking that path alongside you.`
` I have the feeling that, with you, I'd be able to get away from the part of myself that regarded me with contempt and called me furniture."`
`"You aren't furniture, Kanon‐kun.`
` And you weren't born just so you could become a servant!`
` A boy your age should have the right to enjoy life much, much more...!`
` Ha...hahahaha.`
` I'm the one who's dazzled.`
` You're so dazzling......I can hardly see."`
`"These are my genuine feelings.`
` .........I'm...sorry for trying to hide them for so long.`
` ......I apologize for hurting you on that day...in my cowardice."`
`"That's okay.`
` Just hearing you say that......makes me happy."`
`"So,`
` ......in order that I can continue to be with you,`
` ......I plan to stop being furniture.`
` I ask that you give me some time to do that.`
` ......Please forgive this last bit of weakness."`
`"Th‐there's nothing weak about you...!`
` You've shown me.`
` You've shown me incredible courage by saying you want to change yourself from the way you used to be.`
` So, I'll support you until the end, and I won't rush you until you're ready."`
`"......If I'm the sun lighting your path,`
` that's because I wanted to shine more brightly than anyone else so that you'd look only at me.`
` Without you, I'd never have become like the sun.`
` ......So, I'll wait.`
` As long as needed."`
`"Thank you, Milady."`
`"......I...don't want to be ‘Milady’ to you anymore."`
`"May I......call you by your name?"`
`"Sure.`
` .........Oh, but only when we're alone, okay?`
` Otherwise, ...it might make things difficult for you."`
`"......Good point.`
` Nee‐san and George‐sama are doing the same, it seems."`
`"If Shannon hadn't told you about the engagement, ......you wouldn't have said what you said just now, right?"`
`Kanon hung his head, at a loss for words for some time.`
`But it was true.`
`If Shannon hadn't told him about the engagement, he probably wouldn't have been having this conversation at this moment.`
`".........No, I wouldn't.`
` ...Her words...allowed me to think seriously."`
`"Ah, come on.`
` You heard about Shannon and you wanted to see what love felt like yourself, right?"`
`"Yes."`
`"......Th‐that's a pretty straight answer.`
` ......W‐......well,`
` when I watched those two, uh......I was pretty envious myself..."`
`In truth, the real reason was different for both of them.`
`They had been shown the courage that was needed to confess to the one they loved.`
`This was the reason for both Kanon and Jessica.`
`"......So, ......what should I...call you?"`
`"Just "Jessica" would be nice."`
`"......Just saying it like that......would be a bit embarrassing."`
`"Then you can use "san", at least at first.`
` Why not try it out? Come on."`
`"J‐.........Jessica‐san......"`
`"Yeah. That'll do for now.`
` And I'd like to call you by your name, Kanon‐kun.`
` ......You have a real name...besides Kanon, don't you?`
` I'll bet it has {ruby:ka:{p:0:嘉}} in it, like Kanon does...`
` Wh‐what could it be, ......ehehe..."`
`"......My name is Yoshiya ({p:0:嘉哉})."`
`"U‐......umm, ......how do you write it?"`
`Jessica tried tracing out various characters on the palm of her hand.`
`{n}......Then, Kanon used his own finger to write out his name on her hand...`
`"Like this...Yoshiya."`
`"......So, you're Yoshiya...kun...`
` ......Yeah, that's a great name.`
` ......Totally better than my weird name..."`
`"That's not true.`
` Your name, Jessica, is just as—"`
`"Hey, say that again...!"`
`"Huh?`
` ......Y‐your name, Jessica, is—"`
`"One more time!"`
`"Y‐your name, Jessica, is just as......um, ......is something wrong?"`
`"......*giggle*.`
` It's nothing.`
` Thanks.`
` ...Yoshiya...kun."`
`The red, red flowers of the rose garden seemed to celebrate the two lovers whose feelings had finally connected...`
`......The scene was watched by one not human, who gazed out quietly from beneath the rose garden arbor...`
`".............................."`
`Come to think of it, those two had never called each other by their names until now.`
`Jessica hadn't known Kanon's true name.`
`{n}Kanon hadn't called Jessica by her name.`
`By calling someone by their name, people acknowledge the worth of that person's soul.`
`That is why names are sacred.`
`......Receiving permission to speak one means that your soul has been acknowledged.`
`"......Is that why...`
`...Father wants me to call him by his name......?"`
`No,`
` ......that's probably wrong.`
`When Father sees me, it reminds him of that other me—the past me.`
`And I'm sure that "me" called Father by his name.`
`However,`
` ......that probably doesn't mean Father would be happy to hear me call him by his name.`
`After all,`
` .........I am me...`
`......and not the {f:5:Beatrice} my Father knows well.`
`......What can I do...`
`...to help Father......?`
`How can I be useful to him?`
`That's the only reason I was born......`
`Hanging her head,`
` {f:5:Beatrice} sat all alone in the Golden Land's arbor that was next to the rose garden...`
`This scene was watched by the Witch of Theatergoing and her miko as they sat across from each other...`
`".........Poor kid."`
`"I never thought I'd see you feel compassion for Beato..."`
`"......It'd be too cruel to call this Beato and the former Beato the same person.`
` They're completely different people."`
`It may be that, by the rules, this Beato is {i:the} Beato.`
`......However, saying that would be horribly unfair to her.`
`".........Battler must be very depressed to have revived his former adversary and have things end up this way."`
`"I can sort of understand Onii‐chan's despair.`
` ......However, I can understand how this child feels as well.`
` ......No person can become a replacement for another.`
` Not even the past version of themselves."`
`Compared to the young boy and girl who had found new versions of themselves and called each other by their true names,`
` ......this witch looked very feeble.`
`The witch knew that she was an illusion created in the image of the person she once was.`
`And she also knew that it would only hurt Battler to try and pretend to be that person.`
`".........And even so, this Beato wants to be useful to Battler.`
` ...How admirable."`
`"Is that the purpose of the witch known as {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"......That is what she claims.`
` She says that she was created to be of service to Battler."`
`"So, the Beato who was born for Onii‐chan's sake eventually commits a serial murder...`
`and drags Onii‐chan into a bizarre game that she calls eternal torture?`
` I don't get it."`
`"I believe you also understand that one can become a different person over a thousand years..."`
`......At the very least,`
` {f:5:Beatrice} was once a pure creature who was born for Battler's sake.`
`It is also very clear that, in her current feeble state,`
` she does not possess any of the courage or the motivation needed to bring about those horrifying serial murders.`
`If so, ......that means the sinister witch we all know...`
`must have changed during the thousand years since her birth.`
`"......We keep getting this "thousand years" business,`
` but I get the feeling that those words are just a metaphor for a really long time in the world of witches."`
`"As you get closer to the world of gods, the concept of time becomes increasingly vague.`
` Six years can become a thousand, and a thousand years can be nothing more than a quick nap.`
` ......One can fit an eternity long enough to be deserving of the title "one‐hundred‐year‐old witch" in a mere two weeks..."`
`In other words, the pure Beato transformed into the cruel Beato...`
`...during those six years that could be called a thousand...`
`So, does that mean something bad happened during those six years that made her hate Onii‐chan?`
`"That doesn't make sense.`
` During those six years, Onii‐chan not only stayed away from Rokkenjima, he even stopped using the Ushiromiya name.`
` ......Onii‐chan had nothing to do with her change.`
` Her hatred must be totally misguided."`
`"..........................."`
`"Oh, so this is where you were...`
` Shall I make you some black tea...?"`
`"......Kumasawa‐san.`
` ......There's something I'd like to know."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` Very well, what is it?"`
`".........My name is {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`...isn't it?"`
`"Yes, that is correct.`
` You are {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, Milady."`
`"However, ......the {f:5:Beatrice} that Father talks about...isn't me."`
`"......Well........."`
`"I think Father wanted me to be that person.`
` But no matter how much I look like her...I'm a different person.`
` ......I think that might be why he's disappointed in me..."`
`"That isn't true...`
` You are you, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama herself."`
`"......You have merely lost your memory of the past after being newly reborn...`
` Even without your memory, you are still {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` You are the same person whom the Master loves."`
`"......So then,`
` ......how can I regain those memories...?"`
`"Well............"`
`Beato looked at Kumasawa with hopeful eyes, as though praying that she would tell her the way.`
`......Kumasawa averted her gaze unhelpfully, as though trying to say that she would if only such a way existed...`
`"If I can't regain them,`
` ......can't you at least tell me what kind of person the {f:5:Beatrice} Father loved was?"`
`"Th‐......that is something I can tell you, but......"`
`"{p:1:I was born for Father's sake}.`
` So, I want to become the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} that Father desires."`
`"......B‐......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama......"`
`"I can't use magic.`
` ......But if the witch Father desires could use it, then I will learn.`
` I want to become the witch he desires.`
` That's the only way I can repay Father for creating me."`
`".........That's admirable.`
` Without the thousand years gone wrong, she really is an incredible kid."`
`"A chick of a witch......very interesting.`
` ......I've taken a liking to her, Ange.`
` I shall allow this chick to make use of my study.`
` Let us open the door which leads back to the world of witches."`
`"......So, you're going to make her read aloud the stories about her previous self.`
` ...Yes, I want to know too.`
` The tale of how the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} {i:was created}."`
`"........................`
` ...Very well.`
` If you wish it,`
` ......then let us open the door once again."`
`"......Kumasawa...`
`san..."`
`A spray of gold welled up around them.`
`{n}......It was a cloud of gold butterflies.`
`With a golden flash, the form of the old lady transformed into that of a witch in a dress......`
`"You must choose the path that you are to walk down.`
` ......Let us call it a path of roses.`
` The beautifully blooming roses may celebrate you and they may torment you with their thorns."`
`"......But even so, it is a path that you once walked down.`
` ...You may pass through the same thousand years.`
` You may pass through a different thousand years.`
` If you wish, you may even return back the way you came."`
`"I'll move on forward.`
` ......I don't want to spend a thousand years in this garden drinking tea.`
` ......I, {f:5:Beatrice}, was born for Father's sake.`
` So I want to live for Father's sake.`
` Please tell me...about the Golden Witch."`
`......The great witch spread her arms,`
` communicating {f:5:Beatrice}'s unbending determination to the brilliant heavens.`
`At that moment, a brilliant light covered the two of them,`
` and before they knew it, they were in a strange study.`
`There sat the great old witch who was the master of these archives, along with her miko.`
`...{f:5:Virgilia} gave a deep and elegant bow.`
`"......It is the greatest of honors to be in your presence.`
` Lady {f:5:Featherine Augustus Aurora}, the majestic Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating."`
`"Raise your head, child of man.`
` ......I shall give that child the privilege of browsing my archives as she pleases for a time.`
` ......Ange, my miko.`
` See that she has no trouble."`
`"Sure, sure, as you wish, my master.`
` You could just say that you want to see her story, you know."`
`"Miko of the Witch of Theatergoing.`
` ......I leave {f:5:Beatrice} in your care."`
`"......Pleased...`
`...to meet you......"`
`".....................`
` ......The {f:5:Beatrice} you're trying to become......was suffering from something.`
` ...At the very least, you've been released from that for now.`
` ......Will you really go on a journey to regain those shackles...?"`
`"Y‐......yes.`
` ......I want to become the Golden Witch.`
` ......That is the reason I was born."`
`"In order that her journey through Purgatory may be a pleasant one,`
` and that she may be granted protection as she travels, I ask your assistance by the name of the Endless and Finite Witch, {f:5:Publius Virgilia Maro}."`
`"Huh? Oh, uh...`
` ......Let it be known that as the miko of the Witch of Theatergoing and as the Endless Witch and Apprentice Witch of Resurrection,`
` I, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}, do accede to your request and all that stuff..."`
`{f:5:Featherine} snorted.`
`"......So,`
` ......your name is also {f:5:Beatrice}......?"`
`".........Yes.`
` I know a lot about you."`
`"Please teach me.`
` What kind of person was I?"`
`"Sure.`
` ......And I'll want you to teach me.`
` Why did you become the person you were?"`
`"......In this archive, the fragments showing the tales of all your games up until now are stored as books.`
` By reading them, you should be able to learn everything that has happened before now..."`
`"By reading them, can I become the Golden Witch......?"`
`"......To become the Golden Witch, one must solve the epitaph of the gold.`
` ......And this trial cannot be skipped, not even by {f:5:Beatrice} herself......"`
`"I, I'll do my best.`
` So please, let me read the books in this archive...!"`
`"......As worthy of admiration as ever.`
` I have no idea why you want to go back to being like that so much..."`
`"I don't know what I was like then.`
` ......But if that me can be of use to Father,`
` that is what I want to become."`
`Ange sighed resignedly.`
`{n}......She had no words with which to stop this girl from following her noble sense of purpose.`
`...After all, Ange was the miko of the Witch of Theatergoing.`
`{n}She could do nothing except watch over the stage.`
`Yes—they weren't actually interfering with the play.`
`This was just a bit of directing...to shine the spotlight onto the tale of Beato's past.`
`Even this was nothing more than the Witch of Theatergoing watching a play.`
`"If you read, you will learn what kind of a person the old {f:5:Beatrice} was.`
` ......However, you must decide what you will take from that experience...`
` ......You are free to stay in the archive or leave the archive or even return to the archive again later.`
` ......In compensation, I will watch your play."`
`"Watch my play...?"`
`"......It means you can do whatever you want."`
`"Th‐thank you very much, Augusauau......umm—"`
`"She likes it when you call her {f:5:Featherine}."`
`"Thank you very much, {f:5:Featherine}‐sama......"`
`After being welcomed in by {f:5:Featherine}, ......Beato set out on a journey to discover herself.`
`That tale connected the old tale with the new one.`
` It wove them together.`
`......The thousand‐year‐old tale about her returned to its starting point, becoming a snake eating its own tail.`
`The ring of that snake began slowly, bit by bit, to turn into the shape of a small island floating on the sea.`
`That island......was Rokkenjima.`
`The thousand years of the witch born on this island...were tied to the island.`
`Was it a thousand years, or just six?`
`{n}......Or did this tale start even further back into the past?`
`{f:5:Beatrice} went out on a journey to find herself......`
`The wind had been strengthening since a while back.`
`The breaking waves had grown fierce.`
`{n}The ferryboats probably wouldn't be coming for a while now.`
`The crashing thunder told that the island had been sealed off from the outside world.`
`A thick rain poured down,`
` mocking the fools outdoors who had to rush pathetically to find shelter.`
`No longer would anyone be able to leave this island.`
`{n}......And no longer would anyone be able to reach this island.`
`......No one, unless blessed with a miracle.`
`There was another flash of lightning.`
`{n}......The retinas of all who saw it were filled with white.`
`As that white faded away,`
` ......an eerie silhouette pulled itself up at the raging water's edge...`
`As though suddenly remembering, it coughed violently several times,`
` filthily spitting out the sea water that had filled its stomach.`
`......And then, tearing apart the velcro of her life jacket,`
` she cast off the reason she had been able to float here without so much as a thank you.`
`"Hahahahahahaha,`
` ahahahahahahahaha!!`
` Gurgh,`
` *cough*cough*cough*,`
` haah, haah, haah...`
` ......*cackle*cackle*, ahahahahahahaha!!`
` Welcomed in by a storm, same as always! Very <good>!`
` And now, you and I are going to have some fun...Battler‐san!!"`
