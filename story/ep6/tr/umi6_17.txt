`A desolate wind blew through the golden rose garden......`
`Shannon and Kanon had already finished walking 19 steps, and their backs still faced each other.`
`......At the signal of the demons responsible for this trial, they would both turn.........and settle this.`
`Each of them held one of the dueling pistols that the demons had prepared.`
`The bullets......promised certain death no matter where on the body they hit.`
`This duel would not end...`
`...until one of them died......`
`".............................."`
`"..........................."`
`George and Jessica......just quietly watched the ones they loved...`
`They had already entrusted all of their thoughts to them...and their fates.`
`Just watching over their partners...was now the only way they could show their trust.`
`"..........................."`
`"..........................."`
`Shannon and Kanon......stood quietly, with their backs turned.`
`They had already put the emotions of the many days they had spent together behind them.`
`The next time they laid eyes on each other,`
` ......nothing would be asked of them except pulling that trigger.`
`The only one who still had no determination or resolution with regard to this duel...`
`...was Beato.`
`The closer that moment came, ......the less she understood.`
`The love between George and Shannon wasn't standing in the way of the love between Jessica and Kanon or vice versa.`
`......Why, when both sides could find happiness, ......were they forced to kill each other...?`
`"......I don't understand.`
` ......I just can't.........understand...!"`
`".........Little sister...`
` We are not permitted to do anything but watch..."`
`"Zepar‐san, Furfur‐san...!`
` Why......why this duel?!`
` This is no trial of love!`
` You really are demons!`
` You just want to enjoy watching one of the pairs fall apart...!!"`
`"Quiet."`
`"You'll get in the way of the lovers."`
`"You're the ones getting in their way!!`
` One will fall!`
` The one who loves that person will grieve!!`
` If only you two weren't around, no one would be sad!!"`
`""That is not true.""`
`"If we hadn't set up this duel—"`
`"Then both pairs would have fallen apart.`
` This duel is necessary."`
`"I......haven't been able to accept that since the beginning...!!`
` Do you think love can't succeed without a miracle of magic?!`
` The only thing needed for love......is two who love each other, isn't it?!`
` This duel is meaningless!!"`
`"So stop it, you two!!`
` Shannon and Kanon both!!`
` Why do you have to fight each other to the death, when you were once as close as true siblings?!`
` I just can't.........understand!!!"`
`Everyone should have been able to hear Beato's yell.`
`{n}......However, no one's expression changed.`
`"......That's right.`
` I'm impressed that you noticed."`
`"That is the truth of love."`
`".........What is...?!!"`
`"Love needs nothing more than two people who love one another."`
`"Therefore, when there are not "two people",`
` ......we must use a duel to make that number become "two"."`
`"I could understand if it were a duel between two people fighting over one woman!`
` If it were a duel to reduce the awkward shape of a love triangle down to a pair...!!`
` But they are two and two!!`
` The world formed by each pair is complete, isn't it?!!`
` There's nothing compelling them to fight!!"`
`"The minimum number of people that can create a world is two."`
`"Only when two people are together can a world be born and love fulfilled."`
`"That is why this duel is necessary."`
`"So that they can reach that number of people."`
`"A‐......are you saying that furniture is less than {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, and doesn't count as a whole person...?!"`
`""Correct.`
` Furniture is less than {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` So furniture and {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} cannot add up to two.""`
`"That's insane!`
` If two people love each other, their circumstances don't matter!!"`
`""Oh, yes they do!!""`
`"Do you really think that the circumstances of two in love don't matter?!"`
`"Is it permissible to fall in love with a man who has a wife?`
` Is it permissible to fall in love with a woman who has a husband?"`
`"Is it permissible to fall in love with your parents?`
` Is it permissible to fall in love with your children?`
` There are many situations where circumstances forbid romantic love!!"`
`"Th‐then just what is furniture?!!`
` Why mustn't furniture fall in love?!!!"`
`""Because their soul amounts to less than a full person!""`
`"Shannon, Kanon, and the piece that you are as well!!"`
`"All of you are furniture!`
` Subhuman beings who do not possess a full person's soul!!"`
`"There is only one thing necessary to love a human!`
` That is the possession of a full person's soul!!`
` That's why a pair in love can create a world!!"`
`"For example, do you think a man with a wife has the right to love another woman?"`
`".........Of course not.`
` If he loved two women, neither would get a full person's worth of love.`
` ......A man such as that would not be qualified to love."`
`"See?`
` There are plenty of people in plenty of circumstances who have no right to love another!!`
` As long as both people feel love, nothing else matters?`
` That is a comforting lie of naive love!!"`
`"We cannot forgive humans who falsely pretend that they have the right to love!!`
` We cannot permit the love of sub{y:0:-Human}{n:0:human} beings, of those who do not make up the minimum number of people to create a world!!"`
`""That is the purpose of our trial...!!`
` To allow sinful souls to regain the soul of a whole person and become capable of true love!!""`
`"......Zepar‐sama, Furfur‐sama."`
`"Our hearts......are ready."`
`""Please, give the signal to start the duel.""`
`The pair bidding farewell quietly asked for the signal to be given.`
`Zepar nodded silently, then walked to a place that could be seen by both of them.`
`Furfur spoke in a voice quiet enough to avoid distracting the two duelists.`
`".........Watch."`
`"Watch the duel to see which of the lovers will fall apart...?!"`
`"No, this isn't a duel to see who falls apart.`
` ......This is a duel to make true love succeed."`
`"......I......don't understand......what you two are saying...!"`
`"No, you must understand.`
` This moment.........marks the birth of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} who is truly capable of loving another person."`
`"I don't......understand.........!!!"`
`"No matter which of them wins, ......please congratulate them.`
` ......This is the moment......when their days as furniture......come to an end."`
`"The signal is simple.`
` ......I will count to three.`
` When I reach three, the duel will commence."`
`"Understood."`
`"......Same here."`
`"If both of you miss, the duel will be temporarily suspended.`
` You will be given bullets again and will start over from the beginning, with your backs to each other."`
`".........I guess it'll repeat until it's all settled..."`
`"Zepar.`
` Have you seen this sort of duel......many times before?"`
`"Of course.`
` I have seen it many times."`
`"......Usually, how many times do they need to face off before it's over?"`
`"In almost all cases, it is decided in the first round."`
`"Everyone must be really good shots..."`
`"That's not it.`
` ......If one side misses, the other can corner them at their leisure and shoot.`
` ......Miss with that first bullet, ......and there's almost no chance of winning."`
`"However, if you take too long, you'll lose before you can even pull the trigger."`
`".........If you're going to lose anyway, you'd at least want to have pulled the trigger first."`
`"That is a good mindset, you two.`
` .........Now, ............here we go."`
`"One."`
`"Two."`
`""Three.""`
`In the golden rose garden,`
` ...when the number three was yelled,`
` ......the sound of gunfire rang out once......`
`Even the people watching couldn't tell whether that was a single gun firing...`
`...or the sound of both going off at the same time......`
`In the midst of the stench of gunpowder and white smoke,`
` .........there, with gun raised and smoke trailing from the barrel...`
`...was Kanon.`
` ...............Shannon...`
`...was lying on the earth face down......`
`"......Sh‐`
`......Shannon...`
`...san.................."`
`"......No.`
` ......Shannon dropped before the gunshot......"`
`"Nn.....................gah............"`
`Jessica's distressed expression...was enough to explain what had happened......`
`......Slowly,`
` ......Shannon...`
`...stood up.`
`There was no bullet wound anywhere on her body.`
`.........At the time of the signal, Shannon had thrown herself to the ground......dodging the bullet.`
`It had been a gamble.`
`If Kanon had turned around and taken the time to aim carefully before shooting,`
` ......then he would have shot her as she lay there.`
`However, ......if Kanon shot as soon as he turned around, ......she would be able to dodge it.`
`Kanon had also gambled.`
`He did not underestimate Shannon's skill with a firearm.`
`He was fully aware that hoping Shannon would be timid enough to let him shoot first...`
`...could result in him losing before even pulling the trigger.`
`So, he had decided to shoot right away.`
`And, he had predicted that when he shot, Shannon would reflexively pull the trigger too.`
`Since he was already planning to shoot right away, he was sure that his readiness would allow him to shoot with greater accuracy than her.`
`If Kanon had cautiously turned around,`
` and Shannon had shot instantly with the strength of her will, then Kanon wouldn't even have been able to pull the trigger.`
`So, it wasn't that Kanon had acted hastily.`
`.........The two had simply given it their all, left their fates to the heavens,`
` ......and reached this result.`
`"...................................."`
`".........I didn't imagine...`
`......that my quick‐tempered sister...`
`...wouldn't shoot at all..."`
`"I'm surprised too.`
` ......I didn't think that old, prudent Kanon‐kun......would shoot as soon as he turned."`
`As Shannon quietly pointed the barrel at him, she slowly walked forward.`
`{n}She planned on cautiously closing the gap until she reached a distance from which she could hit with even more certain accuracy.`
`And Kanon.........had already lost any means of fighting back.`
`He could only try to dodge Shannon's bullet......and place his bet on the second round.`
`.........They both had that same view of the situation,`
` .........which meant one could be taken by surprise.`
`".....................!!"`
`"This isn't......over yet!!!"`
`Kanon dashed forward like a tornado, bent over so low that he was almost crawling over his shadow...`
`This duel could only be settled by a bullet,`
` ......but he wasn't the only one who had a bullet.`
`If he could steal Shannon's gun away from her, he could turn this all around...!`
`And if Shannon could calmly shoot through Kanon, it would all be over!`
`The odds that Shannon would miss, or that he could get close enough to her before she fired.`
`{n}Kanon bet all the chips he had on these.`
`Shannon could draw Kanon in until the last second, then shoot him from a closer distance.`
`She could also pull the trigger just before he reached her, and they would start over from the beginning even if she missed.`
`......Shannon kept her gun pointing at Kanon's forehead as she compared these options until the final moment.`
`She led her shot, calculating the distance he had already moved and the time it would take to pull the trigger.`
`.........Lady Luck smiled......impartially.`
`"......Rrrrrraa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ahhh!!!"`
`"D‐damn it!!!"`
`In a flash, Kanon leapt to within striking distance of Shannon as she missed the final moment to pull the trigger.`
`He swung his hand up and smashed the gun she held upwards.`
`That strike sent her gun flying into the sky.`
`At the same time, Kanon's gun also flew from his hand and soared into the air.`
`The two guns danced a rondo through the sky, reached their peak, ......and began to fall.`
`By that time, neither one of them knew which gun was theirs.`
`The two guns were exactly the same.`
` Everything about them was identical.`
`{n}There was no way to tell them apart.`
`However, there was one difference.`
`.........Only one of them had a bullet inside.`
`The pair raised their hands to the sky,`
` trying to grasp their fate,`
` ......their miracle.`
`It was as though...`
`...they were trying to grasp the wings of a descending angel of miracles.`
`The pair looked up at the brilliant sky...`
`.........and entrusted everything to Lady Luck.`
`Then, they each grabbed one of the guns out of the air,`
` and after dancing a momentary rondo, ............their arms crossed each other.`
`Even that was like a dance.`
`And the barrels of each of their guns came to a dead stop against each other's forehead.`
`"...................................."`
`"...................................."`
`Even they could not know......which gun held the bullet.`
`When they both pulled the triggers, ......one would die, and one would remain alive.`
`The match would end.`
`George and Jessica had no way of knowing how it would turn out until that moment came.`
`......However, was it really impossible for the two holding the guns to know...?`
`The barrel of Kanon's gun, which had already been fired, must have been warm.`
`{n}And the barrel of the other gun, which Shannon hadn't fired, should have been ice‐cold.`
`So, perhaps the pair of them...`
`...did realize which gun was which.`
`......And yet, .........both expressions were as solemn as could be,`
` ............showing that they would hold total belief and zero doubt in their own fates until the moment the trigger was pulled.`
`"......................................."`
`"......................................."`
`"Don't be sad.`
` We'll meet again soon...in the Golden Land."`
`"We should have done this much sooner."`
`"And that way, ......we wouldn't have to see each other again."`
`"It's alright.`
` Considering what day this is, even this duel is just a farce."`
`"You're right...`
` If we're just going to revive in the Golden Land anyway, it really is just a farce."`
`"Then I'll see you later."`
`"Yeah. You too."`
`"So long."`
`"Kanon‐kun?!?!"`
`"Hey, what's going on?!`
` Hang in there!!"`
`Suddenly,`
` .........Kanon fell to the floor as if he'd had an attack of anemia.`
`It happened without any prior warning, so everyone rushed up to him in alarm.`
`What they saw surprised them.`
` There was a single strand of blood across his forehead, making it look as though it had cracked open...`
`"H‐......huh?`
` H‐how......"`
`"What happened?`
` ......Wh‐......what's going on......?"`
`Trying to get a look at the wound, Gohda wiped Kanon's forehead with a handkerchief.`
`.....However, his forehead was perfectly smooth, without any trace of a wound.`
`And yet, ......almost as though it was seeping through his skin, blood was pouring out......`
`"Wh‐what are you doing?!`
` Stop the bleeding already!!"`
`"I, I would, but...!!`
` Th‐there's no wound,`
` ......but the blood,`
` ......the blood won't stop coming...!"`
`"Hang in there, Kanon‐kun!!`
` Kanon‐kun!!`
` ......Y‐......Yoshiya‐kuu{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}uun!!!"`
`"...................................."`
`Kanon's face was pale, ......and though his eyes were open, they had lost the light of the living.`
`......Just as though...`
`...he was a puppet whose strings had been cut,`
` .........he passed away......`
`"Yoshiya‐kun, Yoshiya‐kun!!`
` Uwaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh, uwaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!!"`
`".........So long, Kanon‐kun.`
` .........And......thank you."`
`Jessica dashed up to Kanon's corpse,`
` .........held it,`
` ......pressed her forehead against his,`
` and as her own forehead grew wet with Kanon's still warm blood,`
` ......she wailed......`
`"...............Shannon......"`
`"......George‐san.`
` ......I......won.`
` ......And now,`
` ......I have...`
`......the right to love you...`
`.........at last........"`
`Shannon......leaned against George's chest......as though the strings holding her up had been cut.`
`George held her in silence......`
`"Yoshiya‐kun, Yoshiya‐kun!!`
` Waa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhh.........!!!`
` Uwaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaahhh...aaahh...aahh......"`
`There was nothing in the golden rose garden except the wind that carried golden flower petals...`
`...and the sound of Jessica's heartbroken wails......`
`"......Is your trial for us finished now?"`
`"It is.`
` ......Congratulations.`
` You two were the ones who remained."`
`"We will give you our blessing.`
` But please, don't forget.`
` You are now responsible for nurturing your love."`
`"......Please, take good care of the seed of love that this miracle has created."`
`"............Of course.`
` ......I swear it to her and both of you."`
`"And now, let Shannon have the miracle of magic."`
`"Now, your soul will become {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` You will become a full person."`
`""Come together, incomplete souls...!!`
` Become one and know love...!!""`
`When Zepar and Furfur faced the heavens and yelled,`
` ......the miracle of love...`
`...gathered the souls around Shannon.`
`They came from the losers of the trial.`
`{n}From Kanon, who had been defeated.`
`{n}And from Beato, who had dropped out.`
`Slowly, .........the bodies of the two began to break down into flecks of gold dust...`
`"......What is........."`
`"Wh‐what's going on here...?!`
` No one ever said that the losers would disappear!!"`
`As she yelled, Beato the Elder supported the body of her fading little sister.`
`{n}However, the two demons were smiling quietly.`
`"Kanon disappears because he died.`
` Beato was born to love Battler, so without that right, she too will vanish."`
`"......It is very fair.`
` If you had survived, the other two would have vanished instead."`
`"Hang in there, little sister, hang in there!!`
` Weren't you going to solve Battler's locked room and save him?!`
` What are you doing, biting the dust in a place like this?!!`
` You call yourself a part of our complete form?!!"`
`".........Why...`
`......was I born for the sole purpose...`
`...of loving Battler‐san......?`
` ......Why...`
`...do I like him...?`
` The truth is,`
` ......I don't know...`
`...why I fell in love with him."`
`"Wh‐...what?!`
` You want to talk about that now...?!!"`
`"......After all,`
` ......when I was born,`
` .........I was told to love Battler‐san and be loved by him...`
` That was the purpose of my birth.`
` .........So,`
` ......I don't really know...`
`...{i:why} I like him......"`
`"P‐people don't need a reason to fall in love!!`
` Don't disappear!!`
` If you disappear, who will save Battler?!`
` Little sister, Beato!`
` {f:5:Beatricee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}ee}!!"`
`............Why...`
`...is it...`
`...that I like Battler‐san...?`
`{a:c:`
`......“Mother”?}`
`"Well, you know,`
` I'm not really a big fan of the domestic type of girl.`
` You know me, I'm a rough‐around‐the‐edges kind of guy, right?`
` ......I just can't handle acting politely in front of girls, ladies first and all that stuff.`
` ......So, if I had to say what type I liked......"`
`"......You know, maybe a Jessica‐type girl could be just my thing.`
` If I'm crude, why shouldn't she be too?`
` ......A rough, relaxed relationship with someone who can cuss and joke around with me, so we're not always thinking about how I'm a guy and she's a girl—that could be just perfect!"`
`"So if I ever get a girlfriend,`
` ......I'd like someone I could joke around with all the time like I do with Jessica...!"`
`"Huh?`
` What would she look like?`
` I'm not too picky about that.`
` But if she {i:did} happen to be one of those blue‐eyed blondes with big boobs you see in Western films,`
` ihhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi, that'd be awesome.`
` I'd love to rub those boobs!`
` Waha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!"`
`{a:c:{m:-5:―}―{f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}Listen to me.`
`{n}I am giving you my love for Ushiromiya Battler.`
`{n}You are to become the kind of woman Ushiromiya Battler desires.}`
`{a:c:You will have the golden hair he likes.`
`{n}You will have the blue eyes he likes.`
`{n}You will have a personality that matches his.`
`{n}And then, ......you are to love him in my place,`
`{n}and if fate allows it, be loved by him.}`
`{a:c:I.........can no longer love him.`
`{n}Please, take these desires I couldn't bring to fruition,`
`{n}......these feelings too great for me to bear,`
`{n}......and see them through yourself.}`
`{a:c:From this day forward,{n}you are no longer the Rokkenjima ghost that lives only to play pranks.}`
`{a:c:From this day forward,{n}you will be the master of this island,{n}waiting for the day that he comes to fulfill his promise.}`
`{a:c:From this day forward, you will do this in my place.`
`{n}So, from this day forward, you will no longer be me.}`
`{a:c:Please forgive me for pushing all of my troubles onto you,{n}...while I alone try to find happiness.}`
`{a:c:From this day forward, you have the right to hate everything.`
`{n}From this day forward, you are the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.}`
`{a:c:And, one day,`
`{n}you will destroy everything, revive everything,`
`{n}......and bring blessings to all lovers.}`
`{a:c:When that day comes,`
`{n}......I pray that you and I will both have found happiness.}`
`{a:c:From this day forward, you will no longer be me.`
`{n}From this day forward, I will no longer be you.`
`{n}The two of us will split a single soul and share it.`
`{n}And though, of course, that won't amount to a complete soul...`
`{n}I'm sure our dreams will be more numerous than most.}`
`{a:c:Let us be blessed.........`
`{n}My darling...{f:5:Beatrice}.........}`
`{a:c:No one else can see your form.`
`{n}But I can.`
`{n}And if you're loved by a lot of people,`
`{n}I'm sure they'll all start seeing you too.}`
`{a:c:We can all {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see}...if we have love......}`
`".........Yoshiya......kun.................."`
`"...A‐`
`......are we...`
`...dre‐...`
`...dreaming......?"`
`"I‐......insane...`
` What kind of joke is this...?? Well?!"`
`"D‐D‐Doctor Nanjo!!`
` I'll go call Doctor Nanjo...!!"`
`"............Gohda.`
` ......That is enough."`
`Genji, who had been calm and silent through the whole thing, finally spoke.`
`And those......were the most reasonable words spoken.`
`......If he called Nanjo here,`
` ............then what...?`
`Not only was there no arm to take the pulse of,`
` .........there wasn't even a forehead to feel the heat of.`
`......Like the last unmelted snow greeting the warm sun of spring,`
` ...Kanon's form...`
`......There was no longer...`
`......even a trace.`
`His form...`
`...had sparkled with a spray of gold...`
`...and vanished completely......`
`"......Where...?`
` Where did he go?!`
` Where's Yoshiya‐kun?!`
` Yoshiya‐kun, Yoshiya‐kuu{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}uun!!!!"`
`".........So long,`
` Milady.`
` ......No, ............Jessica."`
`"......Kanon‐san........."`
`"No one's eyes can see us any longer.`
` ......That means that we are no longer in their world.`
` ......However, we are right here."`
`"............You're right.`
` ......We......are here."`
`"For us, a body is nothing more than a cage made of flesh.`
` .........There's no need to be sad."`
`"......But, .........I do feel sad for her.`
` ......Jessica‐san..."`
`"This is all......my sin.`
` ......This is why furniture isn't supposed to love."`
`"..................What will you do now?"`
`"Though I have lost my form,`
` ......though I can no longer talk to her,`
` ......and even though if Jessica ever talks to me...`
`...I can do nothing except nod behind her back,`
` .........I will be by her side."`
`"...........................`
` ......I think that's wonderful."`
`"What will you do...?"`
`"......I want to save Battler‐san...from a locked room......"`
`"A locked room...?`
` Ha......haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha."`
`After looking a bit taken aback, Kanon laughed gently.`
`{n}Beato, who hadn't expected to be laughed at, looked a little sour.`
`"Wh‐why are you laughing...?`
` This is very important to me..."`
`"But it's a locked room.`
` .........That's only a problem for humans who have bodies."`
`"......Huh?`
` ............Ah..."`
`"We have already been released from our cage of flesh.`
` ......How could a locked room hinder us?"`
`"......A‐are you sure about that...?`
` I mean, there's a chain lock, and duct tape seals, and red truth...!"`
`"I see.`
` ......So, you weren't from the world of pieces, ......but a being from a higher‐level world.`
` ......That's probably why your limitations are different from ours.`
` ......Ah, well."`
`Kanon stretched.`
`{n}......It looked as though he was about to head out somewhere.`
`"......Kanon‐san......"`
`"Seeing as you're a fellow loser,`
` .........okay.`
` I'll go for you.`
` I'll go to the guest room in the mansion, let Battler‐sama out,`
` set the chain behind me, and hide in the closet in his place.`
` ......How about that?"`
`"I, I'm glad for the sentiment...`
` But even if you wanted to leave the cousins' room, ......Erika‐san's seals mean..."`
`Unlike the next room over, the cousins' room where Kanon was had been guaranteed to be a complete locked room, even counting the windows.`
`Not only did he have no way to save Battler, but he couldn't even escape himself......`
`".........In that case, use your magic to give me power."`
`"My......magic.........?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Use your magic on me."`
`"W‐wait......`
` I don't even know how......"`
`"Aren't you {f:5:Beatrice}, the Golden Witch...?"`
`"I am a witch, but.........ummm...`
` I don't even know about locked room tricks, much less magic......"`
`"Good grief......`
` Okay, listen up, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` .........I'll only tell you this once.`
` This is what a witch is."`
`"What a witch is.........?"`
`{a:c:`
`A witch is...}`
`"Not the one who solves puzzles."`
`"......Not the one......who solves puzzles......?"`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` If you're a witch, why are you clutching at your head because of someone else's puzzles?`
` ......That's not a witch's job, right?"`
`"Th‐......then, ......what is......a witch's job......?"`
`"The Golden Witch I know...`
`...used insane magic to create puzzles that baffled everyone and sneered at their confusion.`
` ......Create a horrible riddle that no one can get, spin everyone around, and bad‐mouth them.`

`"Then, you think I should......"`
`"Go for "warawa"."`
