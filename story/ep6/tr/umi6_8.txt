`"Come on, it's okay now. Let's hurry."`
`"I, I hope Father likes sweet foods......"`
`"Oh yes, he does like them.`
` In fact, he seems to enjoy eating pretty much anything.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho."`
`After waiting for the master of the study to be out, Beato and Kumasawa entered the study.`
`Then, they quickly tidied away the books on the desk, set down the basket they had brought there, and began spreading out the contents.`
`Inside......were several cute cookies cut out in a butterfly shape.`
`They set out a cute plate and neatly decorated it with the cookies.`
`It was the kind of slight adornment that the person eating wasn't likely to even notice.`
` The whole setup was filled with that sort of feeling.`
`"You spare no efforts for the sake of your beloved father."`
`"This is......all I'm permitted to do right now."`
`"To think that I would give Battler cookies...`
` Why should I, the ruler of the night, do so much for a guest who comes so rarely?"`
`Then, the study door swung violently open.`
`It was Battler, with Genji by his side...`
`Battler's eyes went wide for a second when he saw Beato there, but his expression quickly went blank again.`
`"......What are you doing here?"`
`"Father, ......please excuse me.`
` I didn't come here to get in the way of your important game......"`
`"How were you able to get in here...?`
` Wasn't this room locked?"`
`"......My apologies.`
` I lent them a key because they wished to surprise you with a gift."`
`"See, have a look...!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama baked these cookies with all her soul, hoping that you would enjoy them."`
`"Kumasawa‐san and Genji‐san taught me...`
` I never knew Genji‐san was so good at baking cookies."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` He hasn't done it much of late, but Genji‐san used to cook many things long ago.`
` He was especially good with sweets...!"`
`"Cookies...?"`
`"Y‐yes.`
` It's a gift for you, Father.`
` I sincerely pray for your victory in this important match..."`
`Battler looked at the plate on the study desk that was piled up with beautiful cookies...and the message card of encouragement lying next to it,`
` .........and his face twisted with a complex expression, which might have had traces of both sadness and anger contained within it...`
`"............My lord..."`
`In not so many words, Genji prompted him to consider giving Beato's efforts some kind of acknowledgment...`
`Battler understood.`
`{n}......He had no reason to respond to this kindness with displeasure.`
`However, even though he understood that logically,`
` ......all he could do was give a small exasperated sigh.`
`"......Thank you, I'm very grateful.`
` ......But I don't like sweets.`
` Please take it away."`
`"M‐......my lord..."`
`"....................."`
`"Don't make me say the same thing again.`
` ......Please clean it up and take it away."`
`"M‐my lord, couldn't you try just one bite...?`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama worked hard to make them for your sake..."`
`"......I'm grateful for the sentiment.`
` ......I'm in the middle of a very important game right now.`
` Important to both me...`
`and Beato.`
` .........And it will be our last.`
` So please.`
` Try not to trouble me any more than necessary."`
`"That's just too sad for her...!`
` I'm glad that you are grateful for her feelings,`
` but can't you show it by taking just one little bite...?!"`
`".....................Father..."`
`Beato looked at Battler sadly.`
`......Battler hung his head to avoid her gaze.`
`The expression on his face was more pained than any he had shown Beato before...`
`"..................`
` ......Kumasawa, clean this up and take it away."`
`"My lord...!!"`
`"..........................."`
`Kumasawa implored Battler to listen, but he turned his back to her...`
`"......My...apologies...`
` ......Let's clean this up, Kumasawa‐san..."`
`"I won't allow it.`
` By making this gift, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama gave it her all to try and support you in your important game in the only way she could.`
` To tell her to take it away without eating a bite yourself... How can you trifle with a woman so?!!"`
`".........Kumasawa."`
`"If you call yourself a man,`
` you should at least try a bite when a woman makes you a handmade snack!!`
` If you truly intend to trample on this woman's feelings, I promise you this,`
` I will not back down even if it kills me! No I won't!!"`
`"K‐`
`......Kumasawa‐san,`
` ......you've done enough for me already......"`
`"I won't allow it!!`
` My lord, do you think there might be poison inside them?!"`
`"..........................."`
`......Yeah,`
` if Beato ever came to give me cookies......`
`......of course I'd think that she'd put some kind of crazy poison in them......`
`She asked me if I thought there'd be poison in these?`
`How could anyone ever think...`
`...that cookies like these, piled up in such a neat and cute way,`
` .......could possibly have something bizarre hidden inside...?`
`And...`
`......who could possibly believe...`
`......that {i:Beato}...`
`......would make something like this......?`
`Because of that, ......Battler couldn't bear to look at Beato's innocent reaction,`
` which was completely free from any malicious thoughts of slipping poison into the cookies......`
`Beato quietly started to clean up.`
` ......Every now and then, she sniffled.`
`Kumasawa had been glaring at Battler continuously,`
` but she now gave a small sigh and helped Beato clean up.`
`However, the hardness didn't disappear from her expression.`
`".........My apologies, Father.`
` ...Please excuse me."`
`"Don't call me that......"`
`".................."`
`"Don't call me Father.`
` ......Beato never once called me that."`
`"Y‐......yes, as you wish...`
` ......My apologies..."`
`Hanging her head so low that her chin touched her chest, Beato hurried out of the study.`
`After giving Battler a look, Kumasawa chased after her.`
`She shut the door a bit violently, and the footsteps of the pair rapidly disappeared off into the distance...`
`".....................`
` ......I may be his little sister, but I'm not sure how I feel about that."`
`"If she were anyone other than Beato, you'd think of him as a true enemy of women, is that it...?"`
`"......I don't have a clue why Onii‐chan and Beato act so friendly together.`
` Right now, I think of Beato as our greatest enemy, the one we must defeat.`
` ......Still, even so...`
` As a woman, ......I can't say I like Onii‐chan's reaction."`
`"Though I can understand Battler's feelings a little.`
` ......What a sad state of affairs."`
`I still don't understand what kind of bad blood or connection there was between them.`
`However, Onii‐chan probably views Beato......as a friendly adversary, if not something more.`
`Onii‐chan's reason for defeating Beato isn't to destroy an enemy out of hatred.`
` ......It feels like he wants to give a sincere answer to her questions.`
`Yes.`
` I can't deny the fact that their fight isn't based on hatred...`
`but on a stronger emotion.`
`".........And on top of that...`
`...Beato really is something, to remain dedicated to Onii‐chan even after being treated so coldly.`
` I agree with the other, older sister {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......I can't understand why she's so dedicated to Onii‐chan."`
`"And, though it may take a thousand years,`
` that single factor that you do not understand must be passed on to the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} we know so well..."`
`"......Yes.`
` I understand that.`
` ......Knowing this Beato leads to knowing the Beato who is to come.`
` ......It may explain the greatest piece in this crazy game, if not the game board itself..."`
`"Such a mysterious witch......"`
`Though she said those words, {f:5:Featherine} wore a confident smile on her face.`
`Her sarcastic confidence, as though she already knew the answer, was unchanged.`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I want to ask you something."`
`"Y‐......yes, what would you like to know, Ange‐san...?"`
`Beato, who had been reading a fragment book in the shadows of the study, jumped when Ange called out to her.`
`"......Why do you call Ushiromiya Battler "Father"?"`
`"B‐because he created the piece that I am..."`
`"......In that case, why are you so dedicated to Ushiromiya Battler?`
` Is there some rule that pieces must obey the creator who made them?"`
`"There is no such rule.`
` ......Pieces are tools, ...like a knife.`
` ......If the Game Master uses them well, they can be quite useful.`
` However, if you use them incorrectly, they can hurt you as well.`
` ......Whether the tool is used as a tool or a weapon, that has nothing to do with the tool's own will.`
` It is merely the result."`
`"In that case, why are you so dedicated towards Onii‐chan?`
` It's almost as though......that's your purpose as a piece."`
`"Y‐.........yes.`
` ...That is the purpose for which I was born."`
`"Did Onii‐chan, the one who gave birth to you, give you that purpose?"`
`"You have that wrong.`
` ......Battler merely set "a piece with that role" on the board as the Game Master.`
` ......The one who gave birth to this piece...`
`was the first Game Master and the one who created this game, {f:5:Beatrice} herself..."`
`"......Aaah, this is getting confusing.`
` ......In other words, you keep calling Onii‐chan "Father", but he's not actually your father.`
` ......You're just calling him that affectionately,`
` because you feel that you have to dedicate yourself to him."`
`"Y‐......yes.`
` ......I think that's true.`
` Father was the one who placed me on the game board.`
` If he hadn't, my piece would never have had a turn.`
` So, the reason I exist here right now and the reason I am able to devote myself to my purpose...is all thanks to Father."`
`"......I see.`
` So that's why it makes sense for you to call him Father.`
` ......In that case, who told you to devote yourself to Onii‐chan?`
` ......Oh, right, that's the first Game Master, Beato herself.`
` ......Aaaahh, this is so confusing."`
`"You wish to ask her why she must serve Ushiromiya Battler, correct?`
` However, she cannot give you that answer.`
` She was given nothing but the purpose itself.`
` ......Only the person who gave her that purpose knows the reasons for which they did so."`
`"......I see.`
` "Consider that as well, child of man", right?`
` ......So, that means you already have an idea and you're laughing at my confusion."`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` You really are just perfect for my miko..."`
`".........I will......do anything for Father.`
` ...My existence will bring Father happiness.`
` ......That is my greatest pleasure.`
` ......And............"`
`At that point, Beato hesitated.`
`"What?`
` And what?"`
`"Y‐yes...`
` ......And...`
`......if I could one day have Father acknowledge my efforts,`
` ......there would be no greater happiness for me..."`
`"Pft........."`
`".........What the hell.`
` ......If you only wanted to serve him, I'd say you're just another piece of the witch's furniture,`
` ......but you want him to acknowledge your efforts?`
` That's less like furniture and more like—"`
`Ange stopped mid‐sentence.`
`......That's less like furniture and more like...`
`......you're just a girl...`
`......who loves Onii‐chan.`
`..................I don't...get it.`
`The guiding force behind this Beato's actions...is that of a girl who adores Onii‐chan.`
`But then, what would that make {i:her}?`
`If {i:she} liked Onii‐chan, then she should have adored him and done things for him herself.`
`Why would she create "a piece of herself", a separate entity, to do it......?`
`This way, ......even if she does attract Onii‐chan's attention, it will be towards the piece version of herself,`
` ......not the creator who made that piece.`
`If I ever fall in love with someone, I'll probably want to do things for them.`
`But of course, I would want to do those things myself.`
`After all, I would want him to notice {i:me}.`
`This love is destined to go virtually unrewarded...... No matter how devoted she is, she will never get anything out of it.`
`{n}And she's done this out of her own free will...`
`Beato's behavior looks no different from that of an average girl in love.`
`She's devotedly doing all she can for him, dreaming that her kindness will eventually be acknowledged.`
`......Why would Beato create a piece like this...?`
`Is putting it in terms of romance a bit too confusing?`
` Then let's try using food as an example.`
`It's as pointless as creating "a piece to eat food for you".`
`No matter how much food your piece eats on your behalf, you won't get any less hungry, right?`
`You are the one who wants to eat.`
`{n}There's no reason for having a piece do that in your place.`
`For most jobs in the world, you can get someone else to do it for you.`
` However, with love and food alone, there can never be any meaning in letting another person do it in your place.`
`That's right.`
` ......This Beato was created as a "piece"...for an impossible reason......`
`......Though at a glance, she looks like just a normal girl,`
` .........the more I learn about her, the less I understand, ......like an imaginary number......`
`"......Father hates it when I call him Father.`
` ......And the "me" that Father desires...didn't call him by that name either."`
`"Right.`
` The former "you" spoke to everyone without even using honorifics."`
`"..................`
` However, ......simply possessing that knowledge doesn't mean I can refer to Father quite that informally.`
` ......I'd like to do my best......and make a start by calling him Battler‐san."`
`"I'm surprised you haven't gotten discouraged after being treated so coldly."`
`"......Fath—`
`no,`
` ......Battler‐san is in the middle of an important game right now.`
` His opponent is the formidable Lady Erika, piece of the great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}."`
`"......I stepped in at a delicate moment in his game, just as it was starting to reach the critical part,`
` ......and called Battler‐san by that name he doesn't want to hear,`
` ......so it's no surprise that he was in a bad mood..."`
`"....................."`
`Apparently, Beato still wanted to devote herself to Battler, even after being treated in such a cold manner.`
`Though to an outsider, it just looks as though she's being snubbed, ......it doesn't faze her at all.`
`It truly is the blindness of a girl in love......`
`"......Or is it that I can't {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} because I have no love?"`
`"At times, love can make the invisible {y:1:‘visible’}{n:1:visible}."`
`Beato once again immersed herself in the fragment book that told of her former self.`
`......She was trying to find something about the Beato that Battler desired.`
`Ange shrugged, as though saying "well, I don't get it".`
`{n}{f:5:Featherine} laughed when she saw this, and quipped that an "innocent young woman" could never understand.`
`{n}Ange grumbled something back unhappily.`
`Their interactions seemed to have no effect whatsoever on Beato as she sat in the shadows of the library......`
`After chasing all the others out, ......only Battler remained in the study.`
`There was no color in this dimly lit room.`
`However, ......for just the short time that the plate of cookies had been placed there,`
` the room had seemed at least a little cheery...`
`Battler's gaze drifted over to the desk, ......which no longer had anything on it.`
`When he did, the cookie plate that had been there until a second ago was revived.`
`However, ......it was an illusion.`
`Though the cookies could be looked at, they could not be touched, much less eaten...`
`If Battler wished, he could make it possible to "touch them" or "eat them", ......but it would be an empty sensation.`
`It would only give the touch and taste that Battler desired.`
`......He no longer had any way of knowing...`
`...what kind of cookies they had actually been.`
`"..........................."`
`In a reception sofa facing Battler,`
` ......a cloud of gold butterflies slowly gathered,`
` ...and took the form of the old Beato.`
`"‘Come o~n, have a bite{p:0:☆} It's not every day that I'll make these by hand...!`
` Have no fear, I'm confident in how well they've turned out.’"`
`"‘Pu ku ku ku!`
` Hearing that from Milady makes them all the more dubious.’"`
`"......Seriously.`
` ......Any cookies you made would obviously have some kind of strange poison in them."`
`"‘Shocking that you should think so.`
` Even if I did put something in, it'd be no worse than the kind that does this and maybe that to your you‐know‐what.`
` Uhyahyahya!’"`
`"‘It's because you do that sort of thing all the time that Battler‐kun will never agree to eat them.’"`
`"‘Huh? Putting things in someone's food is pretty basic, isn't it?`
` Fingernails, bits of hair, magic charms, fragments of love...ehe{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}heh!`
` What would you people put in?’"`
`"‘Yes, ma'aaam!!`
` I wouldn't put anything in them! I'd just eat them all myself!’"`
`"‘Obviously. Do you have to be so predictable?!!’"`
`"‘Well, they say a girl's gotta grab by all three sacks{p:0:☆} The first step is the stomach, right?`
` Next comes the wallet...so what could the third one be?! *giggle*{p:0:☆}’"`
`"‘If I could catch a guy's attention, I'd want to make him sacrifice his body, heart, and soul to me!`
` That's why I pour all my power and affection into my cooking.’"`
`"‘Heheh, in any event, giving someone food that you've cooked yourself is probably a frontal attack as old as time.’"`
`"‘Ridiculous.`
` How pathetic to think that you require such tricks to grasp a man's heart.’"`
`"‘Ohh~?`
` I'd be very interested in hearing how much experience you have in grasping a man's heart, Onee‐sama!’"`
`"‘Battler, there's nothing weird in it, so have a bi~te.`
` Don't think you'll ever get a chance to eat my handmade cookies again{p:0:☆}’"`
`.........There probably won't...be another chance.`
`I slowly stretched out my hand,`
` ......out to the illusion of the cookie plate,`
` ......and touched it.`
`Just before I did, it became a cloud of gold butterflies, ......and vanished into the darkness of the study.`
`The illusions of Ronove and {f:5:Virgilia} also disappeared.`
`{n}...However, the illusion of Beato alone still remained on the sofa.`
`"......Is there something that does not satisfy you?"`
`"............Are you really going to make me say it?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` ......The more the new "me" differs from the form you wished for,`
` ......the more you are reminded that I can never be revived again,`
` ......correct?"`
`"..........................."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` If you let a good woman get away, you never get a second chance.`
` So, only now, you've finally realized what a good woman I wa~s."`
`"......Shut up.`
` If you never appear again,`
` ......that'd be a relief."`
`"Hmph..............."`
`Beato lay sprawled on the sofa and looked up at the ceiling.`
`Battler also turned his back and moved to the window. ......For a while, there was silence.`
`"I think you understand, but......"`
`"......I do understand."`
`"The "me" you were expecting...has already disappeared."`
`"......I know.`
` ......Even though that Beato is you without a doubt, ......she's a different being than the former you...`
`......and I can say with certainty......that you will never revive again..."`
`"My soul, femininity, sparkling personality, and splendid character were cultivated in a thousand years spent as a witch.`
` Unless an exactly identical thousand years is traversed, it is impossible to become me.`
` In short, ......from the very moment you decide to create me, my personal history will be different."`
`"Yeah.`
` ............That damn {f:5:Bernkastel} has already guaranteed that you'll never revive..."`
`"However, you still hope for it, don't you?"`
`".............................."`
`"One day, the new "me" trips and lands on her head, and all her memories of the past are spectacularly restored!`
` ......You're hoping for something like that, aren't you?`
` Ahya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya!`
` A delusional plot like that wouldn't even pass in a light novel these days!"`
`"......Shut up.`
` ......Don't pretend you didn't do the same.`
` ......You waited and waited...`
`...for me to remember...`
`...and take notice..."`
`"..........................."`
`"........................"`
`Then, ......what?`
`Does this mean...`
`......that our relationship now...`
`...is exactly the opposite of how it once was......?`
`".........Hmph...`
` ......Well, there was a time when I continued the game believing that you would eventually notice and remember,`
` ......that a miracle would occur."`
`"..................How did it feel?`
` ......When you were playing those games with me."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...`
` As they say, look inside your own heart..."`
`"..........................."`
`......It's tough.`
`If only she didn't look so much like you, ......I wouldn't be so confused about how to feel about her.`
`"Well, do as you wish.`
` In the past, I toyed with you and tormented you.`
` .........Now's your chance for revenge against me.`
` ......The new "me" will just wander about, ignorant of everything.`
` You may boil or burn her as you see fit.`
` Perhaps it will clear away an old hatred."`
`"............If she was you, I would.`
` It'd probably make me feel a lot better.`
` ......But...`
`.........that Beato...`
`...isn't you."`
`"Who is she, then, if not me?"`
`"......Someone very like you,`
` .........but a different person."`
`"However, there can be no doubt that she is also me."`
`".........Yeah.`
` She is you,`
` ......and at the same time,`
` ...she's a different person."`
`"In that case, the new "me" is most unfortunate.`
` She is being treated like a plaything in my place.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*, how truly pitiable."`
`"...................................."`
`That might......be the contradiction inside me.`
`Because the new Beato seems like a different person, I can't accept her.`
`Even though I know she's a different person than Beato, ......she keeps reminding me of her.`
`"In that case,`
` ......think of her as my daughter."`
`".........Your daughter.........?"`
`"Consider her a blood daughter of mine who closely resembles me.`
` After all, she is my double, but hasn't lived a thousand years, so calling her that is not incongruous."`
`"......True..."`
`"Imagine that I have died, left behind a daughter, ......and entrusted her to you.`
` That way, won't it become a little easier to think of how to deal with her?"`
`"That's actually a good analogy. ......It's unlike you."`
`"Do not jest.`
` That is my daughter.`
` She is the child I left behind after my death.`
` .........You are free to press my likeness upon her.`
` You may also let loose your pent‐up resentment on her in my place."`
`"......Making her bear my sins and torturing her as you please may allow you to give vent to your emotions.`
` If that is not to your taste, you can also guide her down the right path so that she does not end up on the inhumane road that I have tread."`
`"......She was made to devote herself to you since the moment of her birth.`
` If you wish, you can mold her into any shape you desire.`
` .........With a miracle of a thousand years, she might even become me."`
`"......So, I could even strip her and drag her around with a chain, like you did to me once."`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` Yes, at this point, even greater humiliation would be possible..."`
`".....................So she is both your double...`
`and...`
`your daughter,`
` ......huh..."`
`Without a doubt, she is exactly the same person, the same piece, which was created once more by the rule called {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`However, when I can't accept it that way, .........I can interpret her as being Beato's daughter.`
` ......This served as a clear guidepost on how to interact with her and smooth the uncertainty in my heart.`
`............And...`
`...finally...`
`......I could understand...`
`......how cruel I had been to her just now......`
`My tears poured to the ground, ......and when I followed them with my eyes...`
`{n}I noticed that a white card about the size of a business card had fallen onto the floor.`
`It was...`
`...the message card that had adorned those cookies.`
`I had rushed her, telling her to clean up and leave right away, which was probably why it had fallen to the floor unnoticed.`
`I picked it up,`
` .........and read the message on it.`
`.........It was...`
`extremely short,`
` ...pure,`
` ......and sincere.`
`It brought tears to my eyes, ......so I was sure that I could read it.`
`......And yet,`
` ......my eyes were so blurred with tears...`
`...that I couldn't...`
`......see anything.........`
`......The flood of light and sound slowly dissipated.`
`The silence that followed was not broken by any noise, not even the sound of the wind and rain outside that had been so clearly audible moments before.`
`Both Jessica...`
`...and George...`
`...timidly opened their eyes...`
`......Where in the world...`
`...was this......?`
`It was a strange room that they had never seen before.`
`It looked like a Western tea room.`
`......Its furnishings were stylish and expensive.`
`{n}It felt as though a dignified person must own this room.`
`Preparations for black tea were set on the table, ......and so was a chessboard, which seemed to be halfway through a game.`
`However, there was something strangely out of place.`
`The black and white checkerboard pattern made it feel like chess,`
` ......but it looked like a very similar yet totally different game that no one knew of.`
`In the same way that it both looked like chess and not like chess...`
`...the furnishings of this room—no, the room as a whole—looked at first glance like a Western tea room...`
`...but also felt like something completely different...`
`".........J‐`
`...just where...`
`is this place......?"`
`"......Jessica‐chan and Kanon‐kun...`
` ...............Shannon?`
` Where's Shannon...?!"`
`"I'm right here, George‐sama."`
`"And I am here.`
` ......Milady, George‐sama.`
` We apologize for bringing you to a place like this."`
`"......What on Earth is going on?`
` ......You took out something that looked like a butterfly wing and it started shining, and then..."`
`"Th‐the same thing happened to me...!`
` Kanon‐kun took out this golden butterfly brooch thing, it started to sparkle, and..."`
`"Milady, George‐san, first of all, please allow us to apologize.`
` And please stay calm.`
` ......Something strange is about to happen.`
` That strange thing will probably test us."`
`"Test us......?`
` ...Do you mean...`
`that trial you were just talking about...`
`...that we have to overcome if we want to be together?`
` ......Is that it?"`
`"A......a trial?"`
`".........I haven't explained it to you yet, Milady.`
` My apologies.`
` .........But please,`
` ...if your words just a second ago were the truth, ......please lend me your strength.`
` I will......give it everything I've got, so please......"`
`"......I...I'm not getting any of this...`
` Do you know something, George nii‐san?"`
`"A bit.`
` .........I'm just as surprised as you about what's happening now.`
` But if they say that this is an unavoidable trial that's essential for us to go through, I intend to take on whatever may come."`
`"...............A trial......?"`
`"Kanon‐kun.`
` The brooch."`
`"Yeah......"`
`The two of them brought the halves of the broken golden butterfly brooch closer to each other.`
`As they grew closer, the strength of their bright yellow radiance increased.`
`"......Jessica‐chan, I want you to brace yourself for this.`
` I am already mentally prepared."`
`"Wh‐what are you talking about...?!`
` I don't have a clue!`
` What the hell's going on...?!"`
`"It's a trial.`
` A test for a pair of lovers."`
`"H‐......huuh...?!"`
`George spoke those corny words without any hesitation.`
`It was such an embarrassing line that Jessica couldn't help turning red,`
` ......but the expression on George's face, which was so serious that it was almost grim, forced her to tense up as well...`
`Shannon and Kanon were just as serious.`
`......With a glow in their eyes, as though they were taking part in a sacred duel, the pair of them brought the two gold butterfly wings together.`
`Then, the wings they held became a single brooch......and regained their magical power.`
`An even more intense light filled the room...`
`...and the scene was burnt into the retinas of all present...`
`...as the brooch shattered and two shining things flew out of it...`
`"People live for the sake of love!`
` Yes, this world is love itself!"`
`"Oh, how great is the power of love...!`
` Love is everything!!"`
`Suddenly, the voices of two people they had never heard before rang out.`
`What was this?`
` Who were they...?`
`George and Jessica nervously opened their eyes......`
`When they did, they saw that two demons had appeared there,`
` ......almost as though the brooch which had once been split in two had become them...`
`"Oh?! This is odd, Furfur...!!`
` Why are we in a place like this?!"`
`"It really is strange, Zepar...!!`
` There's no one but {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s and furniture!`
` Where is the witch?`
` Where is the witch capable of summoning us?!"`
`"Yes, we remember well the name of the witch of the contract, don't we?`
` Why don't we try calling her, Furfur?!"`
`"Yes, you're right, Zepar!!`
` We know the name of the witch of the contract, the Golden Witch!"`
`"Then let's try calling her name!"`
`"All together now..."`
`""{f:5:Beatriceeeeeeeeeeeeee}!!""`
`Given their manner, exaggerated like a theater play, and their slightly ridiculous style of talking,`
` it would probably be hard to immediately comprehend the great power these demons possessed.`
`When the two demons called {f:5:Beatrice}'s name, a cyclone of gold butterflies picked up throughout the room.`
`Then, it took the form of two Golden Witches...`
`"What's this?! There are two {f:5:Beatrice}s...!"`
`"Well, there are two of us as well.`
` Why shouldn't there be two {f:5:Beatrice}s every now and then?"`
`"This is my double and my little sister.`
` We two are the same and as a single person."`
`"P‐......pleased to meet you."`
`"It has been a long time, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama..."`
`"..........................."`
`"A‐......am I dreaming......?"`
`"......I feel the same.`
` Still, it's too early to get dumbfounded."`
`Unlike Jessica, George had maintained his composure even during this bizarre scene.`
`......After all, Shannon had already told him what would happen next.`
`"Demons of the contract, it has been too long...!`
` Zepar.`
` And you too, Furfur."`
`"Ah, long time no see!`
` You seem to be in high spirits as always!"`
`"But look at your cute little sister here!`
` Those juicy eyes must have the taste of white peaches when they grow teary...!"`
`"Uh, ......ah, ...well, I wonder..."`
`Zepar and Furfur latched onto Beato from either side, wearing strange smiles.`
`Each movement they made was exaggerated yet polished,`
` as though they were acting out a play.`
`"Leave it at that for now, demons of the contract.`
` To think that tonight will be the last time we see that mischievous spirit.`
` It will be dearly missed."`
`"The last time......?"`
`"The brooch, our vessel, has already been destroyed!"`
`"Eheheheheh, in other words, our role is now finished!`
` Ah, yes, it has been fun, {f:5:Beatrice}!"`
`"However, it was decided when the contract was made.`
` It was decided that we must lend our power one more time before our final farewell."`
`"So, this is truly the final miracle!"`
`"Once is enough for the miracle of love!`
` After all, eternal love will never be needed a second time!"`
`"......There you have it.`
` Lovers male and female!`
` Gathered here are those cursed, absent a miracle, to unsuccessful love.`
` The power of the golden butterfly brooch, which can grant such a miracle, is your last chance, and like it or not, this chance is limited to this evening!`
` This miracle can be given only to a single pair!"`
`"..........................."`
`"......I won't lose."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Let's both give it our all."`
`Shannon and Kanon exchanged a serious gaze.`
`......Both had already readied themselves to fight for the sake of their love's success.`
`"I, I don't really get it,`
` ...but I don't wanna borrow the power of some strange demon...!"`
`Jessica was finally starting to figure out the direction things were headed.`
`These demons......were probably planning to pit her and Kanon against George and Shannon.`
`"Let me be totally clear: we don't need your help!`
` Kanon‐kun and I can handle our relationship by ourselves.`
` I'm not gonna be pressured into turning to some shady demons for help!"`
`"............Milady, please listen.`
` ...If we don't overcome this trial,`
` ......we cannot be together..."`
`"Jessica. Accept it.`
` This is the only trial that can be imposed on upstart furniture wishing to be joined with a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}."`
`"More of this stuff about furniture and {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s!`
` Yammer on about that all you want,`
` it has nothing to do with us!!"`
`"You still haven't told Milady...?"`
`"......I didn't know...how I should explain it."`
`"Kanon‐kun, Shannon, and you, George nii‐san!`
` Why are you listening to these creeps?!`
` No one can stand in the way of a person's love!`
` Why do we have to get approval from these demons?!`
` It's none of their business!!"`
`"Well, it seems we have quite a troublesome blockhead among us.`
` .........We could begin the game like this, but that would hardly be fair."`
`"C‐......couldn't you explain it for her?`
` ...I don't understand that well myself.`
` Is there some kind of problem with the love between Jessica‐san and Kanon‐san...?"`
`"Oh my!`
` It seems you understand nothing at all!"`
`"With our blessing, the pair can cultivate their love at their leisure!`
` No need to worry about suspicious demons!"`
`"However, without our blessing,`
` your love will vanish, disappear, wither, and decay."`
`"How the hell're you so sure?!!"`
`""Because it is fate!!`
` You may choose not to accept it, you may choose not to resist it!""`
`".........Oh, what happens if you choose not to resist it...?"`
`"That love will end.`
` ......Well, an abstract explanation isn't so convincing.`
` Well now, how could one explain the dead end fate you're in..."`
`"Ushiromiya Jessica, the future you two share is far more grim than you realize."`
`"If you don't gain the miracle of magic, disaster will most certainly befall you both."`
`"The infection within will fester...`
`and split the two of you apart.`
` ......Even I will not be so boorish as to describe the details of that process.`
` However, if you will not believe, Jessica, I will tell you how it ends.`
` ......Kanon will stop being a servant and will leave the island.`
` For all eternity."`
`"You will probably leave the island yourself in search of the one you love, but such a venture will doubtless be in vain!"`
`"Yes, and then you will mourn and hate!"`
`"Hate who?!"`
`"You!!"`
`"Me?!"`
`""No, the "you" of this moment!!""`
`With a dramatic gesture, the two of them pointed at Jessica.`
`......They were saying that, if she passed this by, it would be herself who would regret it later.`
`"Wh‐`
`......what the hell are you...`
`...saying......"`
`"When you have lost the one you love, you will realize...`
`how much you hate the person you were when you ran away from the trial to complete that love!"`
`"Yes, we're messengers from the "you" of the future!`
` Please, at this very moment, take your love seriously and fight!"`
`"And if you don't listen to the message of the "you" from the future?!"`
`"The foolish snake eating its own tail will keep on gulping!"`
`"The endless cycle of suffering will swallow itself......and simply vanish."`
`"What the......hell are you talking about...?!!"`
`Jessica's confusion showed up on her face as anger.`
`......However, a memory of something she had heard a long time ago surfaced in the back of her mind.`
`......Unlike Nee‐san, I don't plan on working here for many years...`
`After just a few years, ......or possibly...`
`......If Nee‐san ever decides to stop working here, ......I think I'll stop working too.........`
`"Kanon......kun......"`
`"........................"`
`"If you give up on the miracle of magic and leave it to Shannon and George,`
` ......they will be joined and leave the island.`
` ......After that, Kanon will leave the island as well.`
` That is an unavoidable fate."`
`"Th‐......then what if they can obtain the miracle of magic...?"`
`"Of course, Kanon will remain on the island, by Jessica's side for all time.`
` ......He will probably be able to start learning music with Jessica as she wished for.`
` ......How their relationship will progress afterwards is a matter for the two lovers.`
` They may deepen their relationship slowly all by themselves, as Jessica wanted..."`
`"......However,`
` ...if that happens, George‐san and I will not be joined."`
`".........For the sake of our own happiness and futures,`
` ......we are fated to fight."`
`"A‐......are you kidding me...?!`
` What the hell...?!`
` So if we are joined, the other pair will split apart?!`
` What kind of demon's game is this?!!"`
`"Don't be mistaken.`
` You will not be taking something from each other.`
` ......Without the power of the golden butterfly brooch, neither love is fated to bear fruit."`
`"A‐and who the hell decided that?!!"`
`"It is due to your sin of falling in love with furniture, which is not allowed to love.`
` ......Didn't Kanon clearly reject you, saying that furniture was not qualified to love?!`
` Knowing that, you chose Kanon as the one you loved.`
` I won't let you get away with saying you didn't know...!"`
`"...............!"`
`Though she couldn't accept any of it, Jessica was unable to argue back.`
`Then, George spoke up with that soft tone that he always used to smooth things over.`
`......However, his expression was still ruthlessly serious.`
`"......Jessica‐chan,`
` can't you think of it this way?"`
`"Think of it......what way...?"`
`"I love Shannon.`
` I am prepared to overcome any and all trials and obstacles that stand in the way of us being together.`
` .........What about you?"`
`"W‐well, yeah, ......one or two setbacks aren't gonna stop me, I'm tougher than that..."`
`"Yes.`
` That's what this is about.`
` ......Right now, we are being tested.`
` Tested to see who can display the strength of our feelings more strongly."`
`".........Are you actually......satisfied with this insanity...?"`
`"There's no need to be satisfied.`
` ......When I gave Shannon that engagement ring, I swore to fight all trials and barriers that stand in my way.`
` ......No matter how unreasonable or incomprehensible those trials might be,`
` ......backing down is not an option."`
`George spoke clearly, ......then looked at Jessica with a cold gaze.`
`......By now, Jessica almost understood.`
`If she kept on grumbling and refusing this demons' trial,`
` ......the game between the two groups would automatically end with her defeat by default.`
`In other words, George and Shannon would win.`
`Then they would gain the miracle of magic, their love would be completed,`
` .........and Jessica and Kanon would split apart,`
` ......with Kanon eventually leaving the island and never seeing her again.`
`"......Personally,`
` ......nothing would make me happier than you backing out of this trial.`
` ......That way, I wouldn't have to fight you.`
` And it would reveal just how little you actually feel for Kanon‐kun."`
`"Nn...............gah............"`
`It seemed as though George spoke ruthlessly, ......but he was actually being exceptionally fair.`
`If it came to a loss by default, Jessica would never be able to clear away her lingering regrets.`
`That would leave a bad aftertaste even for George.`
`"......We must fight fair and square for that single miracle.`
` ......Even if I lose at the end,`
` ......I'll be able to accept it if we both gave it our all.`
` And because of that, I will be able to cheer on the victors from the bottom of my heart."`
`"............Hmph.`
` ...George's determination is quite impressive."`
`"After hearing all that—"`
`"Are you still going to run away?"`
`The two demons giggled and challenged her.`
`Of course, George didn't laugh, but he too challenged her with cold eyes.`
`".........And Shannon......?"`
`"......Please forgive me, Milady.`
` ......For the sake of being joined with George‐san, I am determined not to flinch in my resolve.`
` .........Even if I know...`
`...that staying true to my heart...`
`...will mean the end of your loving relationship."`
`Shannon had never before spoken to Jessica with such serious and solemn words.`
`Jessica was surprised to realize just how strong the determination was that dwelt within her usually weak and clumsy friend.`
`"Kanon‐kun........."`
`"I......want to start a new life with you, Milady.`
` ......Even if that life...`
`......means crushing Nee‐san's happiness...`
`......I will not falter now..."`
`Kanon was also doing all he could to be strong.`
`Yes.`
`All of them...`
`...were being serious and frank...`
`and abandoning any naivety they might have possessed.`
`All this about golden butterfly brooches and miracles of magic...`
`...and the trial that the demons were giving them—`
`none of it mattered.`
`Only one thing was being tested:`
` whether or not they possessed the strong will to make their love come true.`
`Jessica clenched her fists, ......and hung her head, shaking, while biting her lower lip.`
`She was silent, but she would probably gain an unswerving will of steel before too long.`
`......She just needed a little time first.`
`The two demons who taunted people with dramatic gestures...`
`did not violate this silence that Jessica needed to resolve herself.`
`Love brings about conflict, and this conflict gives rise to determination.`
`As the demons of love, they could understand more fully than any others how noble that determination was...`
`".........Jessica‐san......"`
`"Furthermore, ......this magical miracle is something that can be received by you as well."`
`"By me too.........?`
` Wh‐what......do you mean......?"`
`She had thought this had been about two pairs of lovers.`
`Beato was surprised to suddenly hear that this had something to do with her as well...`
`"With the miracle of the golden butterfly brooch,`
` .........even your wish,`
` ......that your affection for Battler will be acknowledged, can be granted easily.`
` ......And without that miracle, you two will also...`
`............never be bound."`
`"..............."`
`"It means you're no outsider to this either."`
`"To cut across the marshes of love!`
` That is your wish, is it not?!"`
`"We will not make light of your wish!"`
`"......Even your relationship with Battler will eventually fester and rot.`
` ......Even you, with your optimistic attitude,`
` ......must understand that this fate will eventually come to pass, barring some kind of miracle."`
`"...............Well........."`
`Beato hung her head sadly.`
`She wasn't about to let the cookie incident break her spirit.`
`......However, it would have been a massive lie to say that it hadn't hurt her...`
`The more she tried to get close to Battler, the more she hurt him.`
`However, she had been born in order to get close to Battler.`
`...She was like a hedgehog freezing in the cold and bunching together with others for warmth.`
`{n}She had approached him because of love, and had been hurt for it......`
`"If you understand that much, entrusting your fate to a miracle may prove to be of some interest.`
` As they say, an unbought lottery ticket earns you nothing.`
` Zepar, Furfur!`
` Let my little sister join in too."`
`"Oh, of course!"`
`"Welcome, second {f:5:Beatrice}...!`
` We were planning on including you from the very beginning!"`
`""After all, we are Zepar and Furfur!`
` The demons of love!!""`
`"......I‐......is it alright if I......join in......?"`
`"If you want to, I don't see a problem.`
` I won't prevent anyone from entering.`
` We'll win against all hindrances and make everyone celebrate our union.`
` ......Of course, it's the same the other way around.`
` If you succeed in love by defeating us at our best,`
` then both Shannon and I promise to sincerely support the pair that wins.`
` Right, Shannon?"`
`"Yes.`
` We will not lose.`
` And even if we did, we would cheer you on from the bottom of our hearts."`
`"......I feel the same.`
` I will not lose."`
`".........Well, if there's no way out of this fight,`
` ......let's show 'em what we've got.`
` ......Neither I nor Kanon‐kun...`
`...have any intention of losing without a fight!"`
`"You feel the same, I assume?"`
`"Y‐......yes...`
` ......If there is even a small chance that Father—`
`ah...`
`no...`
`......that Battler‐san will acknowledge me,`
` I'm willing to put myself on the line."`
`"Well said.`
` Good going, little sister.`
` Zepar, Furfur!`
` The actors have gathered!"`
`"Then let's begin, Furfur!"`
`"Yes, let us begin, Zepar!"`
`""Let's begin this trial of lovers, the fight over a single miracle of magic...!!""`
