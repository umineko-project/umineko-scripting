`At one time, only Beato and her fellow witches had gathered in this smoking room to chat.`
`Now, however, an unusually large number of people were present.`
`"Ehheheheheh.`
` I wonder what kind of game Battler's going to show us."`
`"......I don't care what...`
`as long as it's fun enough to relieve my boredom as I crush it."`
`"Leave everything to me, my master!`
` I will perform to my fullest and give you the results you desire!"`
`"Yeah, you'd better.`
` ......I kept making strange faces all the time last game thanks to you...`
` Thought I might start getting wrinkles."`
`"Th‐there's no need to worry.`
` The beauty of your face is without peer, no matter how wrinkly it may get."`
`"........................!!!"`
`"Eheheheh!`
` It's rare to see Bern in such high spirits.`
` Beato's game board really is something else."`
`"......How sad it is that the master of this game board is no longer with {f:5:us}."`
`"A tiger dies and leaves behind its hide.`
` Looks like Beato has died and left behind her game."`
`"Even though chess still exists, no one knows the name of the person who invented it."`
`"Oh, you're right!`
` Kyahahaha, poor game creato~rs!"`
`"Come to think of it, Battler‐san is really keeping us waiting, isn't he?`
` Is he still setting up the sixth game?"`
`"......Gertrude.`
` How are Lord {f:5:Battler}'s preparations {f:5:progressing}?"`
`"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.`
` ......Know that he will be finished very soon."`
`"He must have a lot of confidence in what he's creating to keep us waiting this long.`
` ......He really humiliated me in front of my master last time.`
` I'll defeat him no matter what it takes...!`
` And you in particular! Make sure you don't screw up again...!"`
`"......I will meet the challenge with all of my strength."`
`The previous Game Master, {f:5:Lambdadelta},`
` had confirmed that Battler understood everything about Beato's game.`
`However, in order to prove it,`
` Battler would have to run this game by himself and carry it through to completion.`
`In other words, if Erika could crush this game of Battler's,`
` she would, in effect, wipe away the dishonor of that last game.`
`Though Erika was chomping at the bit to get started,`
` it was taking Battler quite some time to show himself.`
`Then, a swarm of gold butterflies swelled out of nothing and formed a human shape.`
`From the shape of that familiar dress, everyone immediately realized who it was.`
`"Ah, look, it's {f:5:Beatrice}‐san.`
` And I thought you'd died and disappeared last time."`
`"......Beato the player is the one who disappeared.`
` This is probably just a piece...Battler's piece."`
`"Even if she is a piece, it does not change the fact that it is {f:5:her}."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} gave an elegant curtsy as she appeared.`
`This humble entrance was so vastly different from her usual high‐pitched laugh...`
`that it created a sense of tension as they waited for the start of the sixth game to be announced at last...`
`"Father will be here very soon.`
` I ask that you wait for just a short while longer......"`
`"...............`
` ...Aha.`
` Father? What's that?`
` This game's new twist on things?"`
`Not only had Beato started talking in an unusually polite manner,`
` she had also used the word "Father"...probably referring to Battler.`
`For an instant, everyone was stunned into silence,`
` but they quickly realized that this was part of something bigger, and they grinned.`
`Beato wasn't the type who could keep up this kind of act for long.`
`It would probably fall apart in a few seconds, leaving her laughing and cackling rudely at everyone.`
`Erika, who was itching for a fight, went for Beato almost at once.`
`"I never expected that incompetent Battler‐san...`
`to reach the truth of your game."`
`"......It must be Father's talent that led him to his profound understanding.`
` He really is clever."`
`"...............`
` You're pretty lucky, aren't you?`
` If Battler hadn't become the Game Master, you would never have revived again.`
` You certainly have the luck of the devil."`
`"......The devil?"`
`"In any case,`
` I'm going to pay you back in full for last time.`
` You're just one of Battler's delusions, fantasies... I'll erase every part of you and knock you down into the abyss of oblivion."`
`"Well, {ruby:watashi:I} also intend to hold my own.`
` ......I, um, look forward to having a good, clean fight."`
`"...........................???"`
`By this point, everyone realized that something weird was going on.`
`There was no doubt that the face, the dress, and the hair were all {f:5:Beatrice}'s.`
`......However, ......her expression was different.`
`Even though she had Beato's face, Beato would never show anyone an expression like that.`
`"....................."`
`"......Just who...are you?"`
`There was a heavy silence.`
`......{f:5:Lambdadelta} spoke for everyone there.`
`At first, Beato wore a smiling yet confused expression.`
` ......However, when she realized that the mood had gone suddenly stiff, her expression finally darkened, and she hung her head.`
`"Who......are you?"`
`"......You appear to be Lady {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`...but is that {f:5:true}...?"`
`Even Dlanor was forced to ask despite the rudeness of the question.`
`That was how much...`
`this woman...`
`who appeared to be Beato...`
`was not.`
`".........Am I somehow different from the {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`...that all of you were expecting?"`
`"What......are you talking about?"`
`"Wait a second,`
` don't tell me you have amnesia or something...?"`
`"I, ...I was only born recently, so I have no memories at all.`
` ......B‐but I...!`
` I'm studying hard...in order to become the {f:5:Beatrice} you all expect—"`
`{a:c:`
`"Beato.`
` ......I thought I told you to stay in your room."}`
`Battler's voice came out of nowhere.`
`......His tone was very slightly cold.`
`{n}Beato's expression looked like that of a young girl being scolded.`
`With a swirl of gold butterflies,`
` ......Battler appeared.`
`His dignified bearing and appearance were fitting for the ruler of this game.`
`......However, his expression was gloomy...`
`and his gaze was directed at Beato.`
`"......Go back to your room.`
` You aren't supposed to be here."`
`"I, ...I just wanted to help you however I could, Father......"`
`"Go. To your room."`
`He spoke both softly and forcefully.`
` Battler didn't leave her any room for debate.`
`Beato hung her head and curtsied as she prepared to leave the room...`
`"Also."`
`"Y‐yes, what is it, Father?"`
`"......My name is Battler.`
` ...Never call me by another name again."`
`"...Y‐`
`.........yes."`
`Beato melted into a swarm of butterflies and disappeared.`
`This was the first part of the tale with Battler as the Game Master.`
`The witches had all expected him to come forward with some flashy, big developments, ...so they were all fairly confused.`
`......Their mouths were still hanging open.`
`"......This is an unusual approach."`
`"Pardon me.`
` ......Please forget what you saw just now."`
`"Hmph, so, are you trying to trick us with this?`
` You're scheming to give us the wrong impression, like another North Wind and the Sun strategy, aren't you?"`
`"......Is there something {f:5:wrong}?"`
`"Don't worry about it.`
` It has nothing to do with you people."`
`"I see.`
` Then it doesn't matter.`
` Alright, Battler! Please start up the new game right away!`
` You've kept us waiting so long, it's gotten totally boring!"`
`"......Sure.`
` Let's start the sixth game.`
` ......Erika, and you too, {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` This will be my tale, proof that I've reached the truth about Beato.`
` ...{f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` Please oversee this game, as a former Game Master."`
`"Sure, looking forward to it. What's the title?"`
`"......‘Dawn’.`
` ...As in, the Dawn of the Golden Witch."`
`"Of course, the winter sun is quick to sink back below the horizon."`
`"Of course, my master.`
` I'll drag it back down for you right away.`
` At least your title is <good>, Battler‐san. I'll give you that much."`
`"I'm glad you like it.`
` ...Then let's get started.`
` The sixth game will now begin."`
`Battler solemnly announced the start of the game.`
`......Compared to his fired‐up attitude at the end of the last game, where he and Erika had sworn to settle everything next time,`
` he was extremely quiet now......`
`"......Ange.`
` Beato seems very different from the way she was before."`
`"I'm surprised too.`
` ......I don't have a clue what's going on.`
` In fact, I don't even get why Beato's revived in the first place.`
` I just finished reading it a little while ago, ......but at the end of the previous tale,`
` didn't she die just before Onii‐chan reached the truth?"`
`"There are two kinds of death in this world.`
` ......One of them is when a piece is taken from the game board.`
` This is only a death within the bounds of the game, and these lives can revive over and over again each time you start a new game."`
`"......And that's why the witches are so merciless when it comes to taking those lives..."`
`To the witch players,`
` the lives of those characters who appear on the game board are no different from pieces on a chess board that take other pieces and get taken.`
`After all, these pieces will be set up again when the next game starts.`
`"Maria's Sakutarou is a prime example of these."`
`"......Sakutarou is Onee‐chan's piece...?"`
`Yes, ......that does make sense.`
`On the game board that represents the inside of Onee‐chan's head, Sakutarou certainly does exist,`
` and is a piece which always stays by her side.`
`Though he's nothing more than a stuffed animal in the real world,`
` on Onee‐chan's game board, he is a full piece, no different from any other piece.`
`"But, ......I wonder.`
` ...On the witches' game board, it's easy to revive a piece, right?`
` ......But Onee‐chan was unable to revive Sakutarou in her world."`
`"......That's because she lost that completely unique stuffed animal that was his vessel.`
` Because of this, the conditions for that piece's existence were violated, and it became impossible to revive him on Maria's game board.`
` ......The only reason you were able to revive Sakutarou on the game board was because you once again satisfied the conditions for his existence, correct?"`
`".........True."`
`Maria onee‐chan...`
`was only unable to revive him because she had lost the stuffed animal that was his vessel.`
`......If, like my family on Beato's game board,`
` she hadn't needed a "vessel" for him, she would have been able to revive him as often as she wanted.`
`"Got it.`
` ......I see that Sakutarou might be considered Onee‐chan's piece.`
` At least, as long as his vessel was okay, he could have been revived over and over again."`
`"Correct.`
` As long as the vessel is safe, it can be revived over and over again.`
` That's what the life of a piece is like..."`
`"......That's the first kind of death in this world.`
` ......What's the second?"`
`"That's the death of beings outside the game board.`
` To continue with the Sakutarou example, this would be like Maria's death."`
`"Not the piece,`
` ......but the real Onee‐chan's death, right?"`
`"It doesn't have to be her death.`
` Loss of interest or concern would have the same effect.`
` ......When Maria grows up from playing with stuffed animals, then "Maria the game player" will die.`
` It's as quick and easy as turning off the switch on a TV when you get bored of it."`
`".........I see.`
` In that case, "Beato the player" completely gave up on winning during the last game,`
` ......so she died and vanished.`
` ...Which means that if Beato thinks she has a chance of defeating Onii‐chan again, she'll come back to life, right?"`
`"Logically, that is true.`
` It's the same for people, witches, and even gods.`
` If they lose interest and concern, they can die at any time.`
` And if they regain that interest, they can revive at any time.`
` ......However, though the concept of time does not exist in the world of gods, who can revive whenever they want,`
` time shoots by like an arrow in the human world, and it is not so easy there..."`
`"That's true.`
` Skipping school for one day might not be a problem, but if you skip for three days in a row, it'd be really hard to convince yourself to go back."`
`"And what if that stretched out for a month, a year, a decade?`
` What if it lasted for a thousand years, like the world of witches?"`
`"......I see.`
` If you skipped for that long, it would mean your "death" as far as society is concerned.`
` ......If you remained dead for that long,`
` not only would you be unable to catch up on all you missed in the world at large, you'd also lose any motivation you might've had when you left."`
`"......So, even though you'd be alive, you could say that you'd died once.`
` You would never again......be able to regain the self that you once were. It would never revive."`
`"Beato lost any chance or hope of winning.`
` ......Even though she knew this, she pretended not to and kept on fighting for many, many games.`
` So, Beato will not return.`
` Her hopes were crushed.`
` She's spent all of the willpower that she might have used to regain the will to fight.`
` Therefore,`
` ......`
`{p:1:that {f:5:Beatrice} will never revive again}."`
`That Beato, who just sat around the whole time with empty eyes in the fifth game...`
`...must have been her corpse.`
`She had managed to remain on the game board despite it all,`
` ......but then even that corpse was wiped away...`
`If Beato had been the Game Master at that time instead of {f:5:Lambdadelta},`
` the game board itself would have vanished at that moment, and everything would have ended.`
`Come to think of it, Beato started to lose the will to fight back near the end of the fourth game.`
`When Beato loses her will to fight, ......the world of this game disappears.`
`However, the witches wanted to keep playing in this game board world,`
` so {f:5:Lambdadelta} bound Beato in place with the curse of that shackle.`
`She used that shackle to make sure that the game board wouldn't disappear,`
` even if Beato did lose the will to fight.`
`In chess, this would be the equivalent of removing the set time limit for each turn,`
` making it endless.`
`However, simply having the game endlessly paused on Beato's turn would cause the witches to die from their illness of boredom.`
`That's why {f:5:Lambdadelta} took the position of Game Master.`
`......Starting then, Beato's existence was no longer one of the conditions necessary for the game to exist.`
`That's probably why the shackles binding her to the game board were released.`
`And that explains why she disappeared in the fifth game...`
`"......So,`
` when Onii‐chan managed to reach the truth,`
` ...it was one game too late for him to tell Beato about it."`
`"The fifth game was a form of charity on {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s part.`
` ......She merely showed Battler some mercy as the Witch of Certainty, acknowledging his strong desire to reach the truth no matter what..."`
`".........How can you call that charity?`
` It's just those fickle witches killing time.`
` ......Let's get back to the point.`
` So, that means this weird Beato isn't the player Beato.`
` She's just a piece Beato."`
`"Yes.`
` ......And if that is so, you would expect her to turn out as the Beato everyone knows well.`
` ......That should also be the kind of Beato that Battler wants..."`
`".....................`
` ......You mean,`
` ...he wasn't satisfied with just a doll?"`
`When playing with dolls,`
` one can project the personality they most desire onto the doll.`
`......However, since you are acting out their part, nothing unexpected can ever happen.`
`You cannot hope for any unanticipated happiness.`
`In the human world, there is nothing so boring as predictability.`
`That's why, though a doll can become a person's best friend in the world,`
` ......people eventually get bored and outgrow them...`
`Onii‐chan only wants the real Beato.`
`He couldn't bear having a doll that he could only make act like Beato...`
`".........A Beato born as Battler's piece...`
`would probably move exactly according to Battler's wishes."`
`"She is a piece, so that's only natural.`
` Pieces move according to their player's directions.`
` ......And they are incapable of moving in any other way.`
` ......I see what it is Onii‐chan wants.`
` Then, just who is this weird Beato?"`
`"......Battler might be trying to revive Beato in the truest sense.`
` ......It is the never‐dying dream held by the children of man."`
`"You just used the red to say that wasn't possible."`
`"......{i:That Beato} has no chance of reviving.`
` However, that doesn't mean that it is impossible to create "Beato" again...`
` Have you forgotten?`
` I believe that {f:5:Bernkastel} herself revealed Beato's true form at the end of the first game..."`
`"........................`
` ......Now I remember.`
` ...She said something about how Beato exists as the incarnation of the rules."`
`"Rules and information, brought together,`
` ultimately took the form of the witch known as {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` If that pattern is followed once more, the same {f:5:Beatrice} will be born again,`
` and perhaps one could call that a resurrection..."`
`".........In other words, that weird Beato...`
`...is like an egg of Beato, ...or else a chick."`
`"That interpretation is probably accurate...`
` ......In short, this Beato is a chick that might become that Beato."`
`"And that means,`
` .........this pure and lovable kid will eventually grow into that screwed up, crazy witch."`
`In other words, that Beato is a baby version of the Beato we all know.`
`So, just like how no person is born evil,`
` ......the newborn Beato isn't evil either.`
`Even though she really is a different person, .........if you measure her by her basis...her soul...`
`...then maybe you really could call this a resurrection.`
`......However, ......this reality can't possibly be easy to accept.`
`Though she may technically be Beato herself,`
` ......she is also, without a doubt, ......a different person.`
`And that way she acts...would make anyone feel as though something's out of place......`
`"How entertaining...`
` ......Hearing you read aloud is far from boring."`
`"......I wonder if you even really need someone to read aloud for you.`
` ...It looks like you already know everything."`
`"I only reached that thought because I am engaged in a conversation with you.`
` ......My thoughts are more numerous than the stars in the sky.`
` I only appear to know everything to a child of man like you.`
` ......However, without you here, I am nothing but a weak, sickly person without even the power to think..."`
`"If you'd just said that in the first place, I'd have agreed to read for you a lot more easily."`
`"......My mood just happened to improve.`
` ...Don't get an over‐swelled impression of yourself.`
` I think of your life as nothing more than a leaf one may lose after using it as a bookmark..."`
`"‘Please continue reading’,`
` is how I choose to interpret that.`
` OK?"`
`"Heh......`
` Far from boring.`
` ...You really do make an excellent miko."`
`{f:5:Featherine} rocked back in her rocking chair and looked up at the ceiling,`
` laughing as though the conversation itself was pleasant for her.`
`Ange was slowly figuring out how to deal with this strange witch.`
`......This person was also...bored.`
`When a sick person has been in bed for a long time and gets too bored, they sometimes act in a rebellious way.`
`{n}On the other hand, they also get a little bored of being treated kindly all the time.`
`She may want to be respected for her superiority,`
` but it's probably more interesting for her when she's spoken to a little rudely.`
`......What a coincidence.`
` That's exactly how I used to be.`
`"Anyway.`
` ......From what we learned in the fourth game, there's no doubt that there was some kind of bad blood between Beato and Onii‐chan in the past.`
` Learning about this Beato might give us a key towards finding the truth."`
`"It does seem so.`
` ......It has caught my interest as well.`
` ...Let us read her tale too."`
`"Oh, sure, as you wish, my master."`
`Ange raised her hands like a conductor, and the bookshelves in this bizarre study responded.`
`......Once again, several books floated out and began to swirl around Ange......`
`Kinzo's study is the room belonging to the master in the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world.`
`So, this study in the world of nonhumans belonged to the master of the game board...`
`...and was a place where he could look down upon the {y:0:Humans}{n:0:humans}...`
`Therefore, it was understandable that one might mistake the imposing, robe‐clad man in the center of the study for Kinzo,`
` if only for a second.`
`It wasn't Kinzo.`
`......It was Battler, the one who had taken up the position of Game Master,`
` and who had become the new territory lord of this world.`
`"................................."`
`Around Battler was a swirl of glowing fragments, sparkling like the night sky,`
` ......and on the floor was what appeared to be a red magic circle.`
`To an outsider, it would have appeared to be nothing more than an incomprehensible geometric shape.`
`But to Battler, who stood at its center,`
` it was the outline for a new tale...`
`A new line grew across the magic circle, following Battler's gaze.`
`Then, at the instant it connected with a complicated symbol, the entire magic circle flashed brightly.`
`"......So,`
` ......how does it look?"`
`"It is splendid, my lord.`
` ......The sixth game is complete."`
`As Battler wiped his forehead and finally relaxed,`
` Genji, who was standing behind him and watching over his every move, nodded deeply in response.`
`"......I always thought being a Game Master meant you could make the tale however you want,`
` ......but this is seriously harder than I thought it'd be."`
`"You must write up multiple tales and make the inner and outer sides of the story match.`
` ......And yet, you have displayed such skill, it is hard to believe that this is your first time.`
` ......I believe even Erika‐sama will be satisfied with this game."`
`"Well, hopefully it matches that great detective's tastes.`
` ......Still, ...I've got to honestly respect Beato now.`
` ...I can hardly believe that she managed to create such complicated stories so easily."`
`"......It was not easy.`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama spent a long, long time deliberating, and each time she created a tale, she would worry over various contradictions.`
` She was constantly battling with logic errors."`
`"Logic errors?"`
`"That is when the two sides of the tale do not meet, creating a contradiction.`
` ......When this happens, it becomes a fatal violation of the rules known as a logic error, and the game board will immediately collapse and be destroyed.`
` It is the greatest and worst form of error that the witch side can make, and one which must always be avoided."`
`"And Beato...`
`got close to bumping into those several times in her games...?"`
`"......She fought with them every time she created a game.`
` ...I believe it grew even more difficult for her as you became a more effective opponent."`
`"............So,`
` ......do you think this game I've made...`
`...is good enough to show Beato?"`
`"......Yes.`
` ......Of course."`
`"...............`
` ......Has Beato...`
`still not woken up?"`
`"..........................."`
`"It's been a while since her body was formed as a personification of the rules.`
` Is she still not awake...?"`
`After remaining silent for a while longer, Genji answered.`
`"......She woke up three days ago.`
` You were concentrating on the construction of the sixth game, so I decided to wait before telling you...`
` My sincere apologies..."`
`"Oh, really?`
` Yeah, I'll bet she's still all drowsy after sleeping so long.`
` I've really wanted to show her my game!`
` No, it's more than that, I have to show her my game.`
` I need to tell her that I've understood everything."`
`Battler's face broke into a smile.`
`There was no trace in his expression of the hatred he had once felt towards Beato for murdering his family...`
`"......In a way,`
` ...that was the final mystery of the fifth game."`
`"Yes.`
` ......When Battler reached the truth, there was a great change in his impression of Beato."`
`"Does that mean it's fair to assume that there really was some kind of connection between Onii‐chan and Beato,`
` and that he forgot all about it...?"`
`However, Battler suspected this in the fourth game and asked Beato about it.`
`And within the story,`
` this was denied by the red truth:`
` "Six years ago, no person called {f:5:Beatrice} existed for Battler"...`
`"......We can read this as saying that Beato did not exist six years before,`
` or it could simply mean that she had no connection to Battler at that time.`
` However, either way, Battler did not visit Rokkenjima at all for the next six years..."`
`"October 4th, 1986 should have been the first time {f:5:Beatrice} and Onii‐chan met.`
` ......If so, why was there already some kind of bad blood between them?`
` I don't have a clue what it means."`
`"......That "Ushiromiya Battler's sin", which Beato questioned Battler about in the fourth game,`
` might give us a clue.`
` ...The result of that might have been {f:5:Beatrice} herself."`
`"The result?`
` The result of Onii‐chan's sin was...Beato...?"`
`That almost sounds as though...`
`Onii‐chan created the witch called {f:5:Beatrice} himself...`
`"Almost as though...`
`...{f:5:Beatrice} was Battler's piece."`
`"......Huh...?"`
`"Six years earlier, Battler committed a sin.`
` Because of that sin, people died.`
` The killer was {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......If you consider the possibility that everything is connected to Battler's sin six years before,`
` ......then the one who created {f:5:Beatrice} was Battler himself.`
` I thought it sounded almost as though she was Battler's piece..."`
`"I don't get it.`
` If Onii‐chan sinned in some way, it must have been something much lighter than murder, at the very least.`
` If someone caused this huge massacre in retaliation for that,`
` that's totally out of proportion."`
`"Beato killed our family.`
` Dad, Mom, Onii‐chan, everyone.`
` ......I can't believe that Onii‐chan's sin was anything deserving of that."`
`"The weight of a sin depends on the person measuring it.`
` Even a sin so light that Battler might have forgotten...`
`could have been so serious to Beato that she hated him enough to massacre his whole family a full six years after the fact."`
`"......Well, even I think that a bit excessive, and more importantly, if she were a person like that,`
` I would find it hard to accept that Battler would act so friendly towards her after discovering the truth..."`
`".............................."`
`{f:5:Featherine}'s observation was extremely interesting.`
`In a past game,`
` Beato said clearly that Onii‐chan's sin six years before was the cause of this two‐day tragedy.`
`I still don't know what kind of sin that was.`
`However, he figured it out at the end of the fifth game,`
` ......and he even apologized to Beato.`
`Even though she was the witch who had massacred his entire family in retaliation for his sin of six years before,`
` ......Battler apologized to her.`
`......Of course, it was the player Battler who apologized,`
` not the piece Battler whose family had been murdered over and over again.`
`But even so, ......Battler must have remembered something at the end of the last game...`
`that made him feel like apologizing...`
`"......This sin from six years before.`
` ......Does this mean that it's hidden somewhere in the tale so far...?"`
`"...I have already formed a theory about it."`
`"Oh?`
` Let me hear it."`
`"Heheheheheh, I can't tell you yet.`
` I want to enjoy being the only one who knows the answer for a little while longer..."`
`"......Well then, I guess I'm done reading for you."`
`"Hahaha, well, we can't have that, can we?`
` ......Have some patience and read a bit further.`
` My theory is still nothing more than a guess.`
` ......Once I'm certain of it, I'll tell you."`
`"Okay, okay, my master.`
` I actually do want to hear what comes next, after all."`
`Onii‐chan and {f:5:Beatrice}...`
` Just what kind of connection is there between them?`
`......Learning that will probably be the ultimate key to the truth of this world.`
`After all, remembering that...`
`was what enabled him to reach the truth.`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}...!!"`
`"Welcome, my lord...`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is waiting for you.`
` This way, please......"`
`This place was a villa set aside for {f:5:Beatrice}'s use.`
`It was a sacred site for her only, built so that she could spend her days without being affected by the outside world.`
`My heart began to race.`
` ......I'm so glad that she was able to revive...and that everything's okay...`
`Beato is a personification of the rules.`
`So, even though she was destroyed once, it is possible for her to be reborn again...`
`Battler had quickly succeeded in reviving Beato's body, but he had had trouble summoning her soul back.`
`However, during the time he had spent immersed in the creation of the sixth game, she had woken up.`
` And this had happened three days ago.`
`Battler let himself be led into the dining hall.`
`The dining hall had been set up for his and Beato's use.`
`......It existed so that they could enjoy some black tea while discussing the truth, now that he had finally reached it in its entirety.`
`I want to tell her.`
`I want to tell Beato that I've found the truth.`
`Battler couldn't hold back his excitement over this miracle he had been granted, that Beato was waiting for him in the dining hall to hear what he had to say...`
`"How is {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` Same as usual?`
` Is she in high spirits?"`
`"Oh yes, she is in very high spirits now.`
` She has been waiting for you all this time, my lord. Oh yes."`
`"Is she in the dining hall? Is she eating or something?`
` Ah, that's alright, it doesn't matter either way...!"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, you'll be surprised..."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}...!!"`
`When he swung open the doors to the dining hall,`
` ......Battler was greeted by a wonderful sight.`
`Though the food laid out on the table wasn't particularly sensational,`
` it was arranged beautifully, and a champagne bottle stood there waiting.`
`......Then, ......the person clad in that familiar dress with the beautiful golden hair bowed deeply in greeting.`
`"......B‐......{f:5:Beatrice}..."`
`"You have my sincerest gratitude for giving me this form."`
`"Ha...hahahaha...`
` Come on, don't worry about that......`
` ...I'm so glad...`
` Beato........."`
`Battler rushed up to Beato and hugged her tightly.`
`Just to make sure her body wasn't just mist or an illusion...`
`"......I...`
`...solved...`
`your riddle for you......`
` But then,`
` before I could tell you about it,`
` you went and disappeared......"`
`"......I am right here...`
` I will not disappear..."`
`"It's okay, you can stop talking like that.`
` I'm not going to ask you for anything in return.`
` ......Anyway, I want to apologize.`
` And I want to talk with you.`
` ......I don't even know where I should start."`
`"You have done nothing that you need to apologize for, Father.`
` ...I'm glad just to be of service to you."`
`".........Beato......?"`
`"I was born for your sake, Father.`
` Please, let me support you.`
` And Father,`
` congratulations on completing the sixth game."`
`"I told you, stop talking like that.`
` It's totally creepy."`
`"......Do you find this style of speech displeasing?`
` Please forgive my rudeness..."`
`"Well, I don't "find it displeasing", but it's not like you.`
` I guess I like the way you usually talk best."`
`"....................."`
`Beato smiled vaguely.`
`To Battler, it probably looked as though they were both smiling over the same joke.`
`......However, Beato's smile was literally vague and uncertain.`
`After all...she didn't know how she was supposed to talk...`
`"Anyway, Beato.`
` Just what kind of joke is this?`
` Don't tell me that the great {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama decided to cook for me...?"`
`"When I heard that you had completed the sixth game,`
` I wanted to see if I could prepare a modest reward to congratulate you......"`
`"...Hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama really worked hard to make this.`
` I didn't even need to lend a hand at all, no I didn't!"`
`The food set on the table really was modest and inexpertly made.`
`You could tell by looking at it that Beato, who wasn't particularly skilled with cooking, had given it her all when making it...`
`However, signs of discomfort and irritation were beginning to appear on Battler's face......`
`"......What...`
`......is this all about...?"`
`"Well, as she said, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama decided that she would like to congratulate......"`
`Sweat was starting to show up on Kumasawa's forehead...`
`......She was also feeling uneasy.`
`When he noticed, Battler realized that it wasn't just his imagination.`
`Beato turned her back to Battler and stuck a corkscrew into the champagne bottle.`
`Then, she showed it to Battler.`
`"Father, congratulations on the completion of the sixth game.`
` In the hopes that you will prove victorious over your longtime rival, Furudo Erika..."`
`Pop.`
`When presented with a champagne bottle and a sound like that, anyone would think that the cork had been pulled out.`
`However, it wasn't the cork......it was the bottom of the bottle.`
`The high‐quality champagne that Beato had procured splashed out all over the floor and her dress.`
`Then, the same sound repeated several more times.`
`......Each time, one of the plates of food on the table was knocked into the air.`
`"F‐`
`......Father,`
` ......did you find the food displeasing...?"`
`"Who......are you...?"`
`"...I, ......I am {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...I was born for your sake, Father..."`
`"No..."`
`"Huh...?"`
`"Who is this?!`
` This isn't Beato...!!`
` And don't call me Father...!!`
` What's going on here?!`
` What is this?!`
` Didn't I revive Beato?!`
` Genji, what's this all about?!!"`
`"......My apologies,`
` but that is indeed {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"Like hell it is!`
` How is this supposed to be Beato?!`
` She's totally wrong, a fake!!"`
`"No, that is {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` It is, without a doubt, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, who was born in accordance with the rules of the game board."`
`"No, this isn't anything like Beato...!!`
` Beato would always talk in this weird way, she'd laugh rudely, and more, and more...!!"`
`"No, this is unquestionably {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama herself."`
`"Then why is she talking like that?`
` Why is she calling me Father?!"`
`"B‐{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama was only born a short while ago...`
` It would be far too cruel to expect her to act as she once did so soon..."`
`"Are you saying that her memory hasn't returned yet?"`
`".........My lord.`
` This person is most certainly {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama herself.`
` However, she is not the {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama you know so well."`
`"What are you talking about...?!`
` I'm the Game Master, right?!`
` Why can't I revive Beato...?!"`
`"Oh yes, she most certainly has revived.`
` However, the old {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama had lived for a thousand years.`
` ......This {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, on the other hand, was only born a short while ago...!`
` If she appears to be a different person, well, that just can't be helped...!"`
`"Then, ...how can I revive that Beato?!`
` Her body is right here!`
` How can I revive her soul?!"`
`"......If she lives the same thousand‐year life again, she should become the same {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama she was before."`
`"So I'm supposed to wait a thousand years...?!"`
`"A, a person's personality isn't decided solely by their birth.`
` It can change drastically based on how they live and what they experience..."`
`"......Do you understand?`
` Even though she is the same Beato, she is not the same."`
`"I get it.`
` ......Even if you had two of the exact same person, they could change enormously depending on their upbringing."`
`"Even though they might both be the same human to start with, their upbringing could change them so much that they effectively become two completely different people.`
` ......Usually, we use the term "person" to refer to a person, not their personality.`
` However, since {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s recognize a person by their personality, they might as well be two different people, from a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} perspective..."`
`"......That's so true.`
` If that tragedy twelve years ago hadn't happened, missy here might have been a cute girl who could smile without looking weird."`
`"That's rude.`
` I'm cute enough right now, thank you very much."`
`......I understand.`
`If a personality is what makes a person a person in our eyes,`
` you could say that a second personality is a different person entirely, even if it inhabits the same flesh body.`
`At the very least,`
` I'm a completely different person than I used to be twelve years ago.`
`And if my family had come home twelve years ago,`
` ......then the Ange that resulted would surely be a completely different person from me.`
`Even the same human can become different people.`
`{n}In fact, depending on their upbringing and endless possibilities, they can become an endless number of different people.`
`......So, just because this is the same Beato,`
` ......that's no guarantee at all that she'll be the Beato that Onii‐chan knows so well.`
`"And on top of that, {f:5:Beatrice} is a witch who lived a thousand years.`
` ......A person can die and be reborn in the span of just three days.`
` A thousand years.........is just too long."`
`".........It seems you're quite a skilled reader.`
` ...For most of my readers, it would be necessary to devote several hundred pages to explaining how a single human...`
`can become different people depending on their upbringing and the passage of time."`
`"Don't underestimate your readers.`
` We aren't just reading.`
` We read...and we think."`
`"......If I give my work to a hundred people to read, ninety will actually be able to.`
` However, only fifty will actually understand what it means.`
` And not even twenty will be capable of thinking beyond that.`
` ......Yet all I am asking is that they chew before they swallow.`
` ...Nothing more than that. *giggle*"`
`"However, it seems that "you" are one of those precious twenty readers...`
` That's why I invited you here, child of man..."`
`It was hard to actually like this Hachijo Tohya person.`
`......However, though this forgery she had written was still in its first stages,`
` ......it definitely felt as though it had something very similar to the tales in those message bottles.`
`Speaking metaphorically, ......one might call it a scent.`
`An indescribable stern atmosphere, ......like a stuffy library.`
`The "{f:5:Beatrice}" who wrote the message bottles and Hachijo Tohya are different people.`
`......And yet, this has the same scent as that tale...`
`......I see.`
` This is why some of those curious Witch Hunters are so intensely devoted to her...`
`Their keen sense of smell was able to sniff out that familiar scent......`
`"Very well then.`
` ......Please continue reading.`
` There could be nothing more entertaining than watching your face as you glance over the words.`
` That, and speaking with you..."`
`"I guess it's true that writers are always starving for opinions on their works.`
` ......Sorry to disappoint you, but I don't have time to read all the way through this thick manuscript.`
` More importantly, I came here to............"`
`"......But you have all the time in the world......"`
`Both the second hand and the pendulum on the ornate clock behind Hachijo had been moving the whole time.`
`However, ......absolutely no time had passed for a while now.`
`Only about three minutes had gone by since the time she had entered the room...`
`"See?`
` Time isn't something you have to worry about.`
` ......Time everywhere will leave you alone until you've finished reading..."`
`"................................."`
`"Next page, missy, next page."`
`Amakusa badgered me to turn the page, ......so I returned to the world of the tale once more.`
`......Why does her tale have the same scent as {f:5:Beatrice}'s, I wonder...`
`Is it because......she actually has reached the truth, as she claims?`
`Does this mean that anyone who knows the truth could create an endless number of message bottles?`
`......Is that what the cat box world is like...?`
`I see.`
` ......Maybe she really is an Endless Witch herself.`
`In fact,`
` ......maybe anyone who knows the truth can become an Endless Witch.`
`An endless tale created by Endless Witches.`
`{n}The two days starting on October 4th, 1986, where my family is being toyed with endlessly.`
`......I have to end it.`
`I have to find a hint of the truth from within this story......and end this endless tale.`
`"What do you think, Beato?`
` How's this sixth game I've made?"`
`"........................"`
`"Well, you're not the type to give me an honest compliment anyway, are you...`
` You'd probably say something more like "not bad for an incompetent fool like you"."`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` Not bad for an incompetent fool like you."`
`"Heh.`
` Now that I've seen what it's like to be a Game Master, I understand everything.`
` ......You really had to work hard during each and every game."`
`"........................"`
`"‘Creating a game is not such an easy thing.`
` To think the day would come when we would both congratulate each other like this.’"`
`"Creating a game is not such an easy thing.`
` To think the day would come when we would both congratulate each other like this."`
`".............................."`
`".............................."`
`"......All wrong...`
` ......This......isn't Beato..."`
`Battler slammed hard on the desk, but the piece Beato showed no reaction.`
`......After all, Battler hadn't ordered her to react.`
`It was easy to revive that Beato as a piece.`
`{n}However, it would only move according to Battler's wishes.`
`......Having a conversation with it...`
`...was no different...`
`...from talking to himself......`
`The Game Master could summon any kind of piece.`
`{n}He could move those pieces in any way he wanted, reigning as an absolute god.`
`......However, for that very reason,`
` ......they were just pieces.`
`That made it unbelievably lonely...`
`...and sad.`
`"......You created many kinds of furniture, as well as several tales in the past.`
` ......When I saw that, ......I was sure you were having a great time doing it."`
`""‘But that's wrong.’""`
`"You were......unbelievably lonely."`
`"‘It must have been such a relief for you to have an opponent in me who could actually go against you.`
` I'm painfully aware of that now.’"`
`".........That weird, polite Beato...`
`...she {i:is} you, I don't doubt that.`
` ......The way you were a thousand years ago."`
`""‘However,`
` ......she is a separate person.’""`
`"The way she looks just like you is what I really can't get over...!`
` I can't stand it......"`
`"‘However, she isn't a piece, so she can go against my will.’"`
`"Sure, unlike the piece {i:you} are, that Beato is much more alive.`
` I acknowledge that!`
` But it's all wrong!!`
` That isn't you!`
` She's a completely separate person, like a long‐lost little sister or something!`
` And that's why...`
`...I just can't accept her...!!"`
`......As much as he hated this piece Beato...`
`Battler felt an even stronger dislike...`
`...for the "chick" Beato.`
`Even after a whole thousand years,`
` she still wouldn't become the original Beato.`
`Even if she were ordered to act like the original Beato, ......it would just be an imitation.`
`This was a very similar but separate person, and definitely not Beato herself.`
`......Then, .........in the previous game,`
` ......Beato really did disappear for all eternity...`
`Even after becoming the Game Master,`
` .........there was no way to revive her.........`
`"......Laugh.`
` Laugh at how pathetic I am."`
`"............`
` ......Heheheheh,`
` *cackle*cackle*.`
` Pfft,`
` hya`
`hah`
`ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}a{0}aah!!"`
`Just give it a rest already......`
`You're just an illusion who won't laugh unless I order it...`
`...and who can't even continue to laugh unless I keep on ordering it...`
` ......Just disappear!!`
