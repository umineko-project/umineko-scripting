`""Then let the pair exchange their rings!!""`
`......Beato took Battler's hand.........and put a ring with the seal of the One‐winged Eagle on his finger.`
`".........Are you sure...?"`
`"You are already the territory lord.`
` ......So, this ring belongs to you, Battler‐san."`
`"......You're certain?`
` ......This is the world you created...... Your tale."`
`"Yes.`
` .........I created this tale because I wanted to be with you.`
` ......That means the purpose of this world has been fulfilled.`
` ......So, from now on, ......I want you to write it.`
` ......The rest of the tale...about you and me."`
`"................................."`
`"......Heh, or am I dragging you out of your comfort zone?!`
` *cackle*cackle*, I am merely pushing the tiresome task of territory lord onto you.`
` It's much easier being the wife, where you only have to brag...!"`
`"I just need to play around and wait for you to write a new tale.`
` And, for each new tale you write, I will play any role you devise for me.`
` .........A wicked witch, or an adversary.`
` ......A lover, ......or a wife."`
`"My tales are pretty intense.`
` You'll be busy from dawn until dusk."`
`"Hmm...... Sounds perfect..."`
`Beato's hand relinquished the ring of the territory lord......`
`From Battler, she received a silver ring with a crest that could only be worn by the wife of the territory lord.`
`Then, they exchanged their rings, ......and their wedding was complete.`
`Then, the pair turned around, ......faced the packed crowd of guests, and raised their rings high.`
`A thunderous applause rang out for them......`
`"In commemoration of the night's events, the great territory lord will now recognize the accomplishments of certain people."`
`"Let those called come forward."`
`At Battler's nod, Beato read the name of the first guest to be recognized.`
`"......Kanon.`
` Come forward."`
`"K‐Kanon‐kun...?!"`
`A girl goat pushed her way through the crowd, took off her mask, and yelled.`
`A cloud of gold butterflies gathered before Battler and Beato...`
`...and took the form of Kanon, kneeling in front of these two nobles.`
`Kanon had already died and vanished.`
`{n}......However, all of the dead revive in the Golden Land.`
`"Kanon, right here......"`
`"When my husband was locked up and in danger,`
` you rescued him and displayed your self‐sacrifice by choosing to remain in the eternal prison in his place.`
` Your devotion is deserving of commendation.`
` Therefore, we will allow for your resurrection, as well as your continued service."`
`"......My lady,`
` I am deeply thankful!"`
`"Kanon‐kun, ......Y‐...Yoshiya‐kun!!`
` Yoshiya‐kunnnn!! Waaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aahhh!!"`
`Jessica raced forward and landed sobbing in Kanon's chest.`
`{n}Kanon patted her head gently and held her......`
`"You won't be serving as furniture.`
` You'll be serving as a human.`
` ......Do you understand what that means?"`
`"............I do!"`
`After looking at Jessica sobbing, ......he looked at Battler again and nodded forcefully.`
`"Now for the next pair.`
` Ushiromiya George and Shannon!`
` Come forward!!"`
`""Yes.""`
`George and Shannon were the next to be called.`
`Perhaps they had already readied themselves.`
` They walked forward boldly and kneeled.`
`"Ushiromiya George, right here."`
`"Shannon, right here......"`
`"You two withstood Zepar and Furfur's trials until the very end.`
` Your great achievements and affection, determination and nobility are exemplary and deserving of commendation.`
` Therefore, I issue you a marriage certificate signed by his lordship!"`
`""We are deeply thankful.""`
`"This certificate overrides objections from one and all!`
` Let the families of those recognized bless this union with all their hearts!!"`
`"You heard her.`
` No more squabbling, let's all just throw rice at them and celebrate.`
` Congrats, you two!"`
`When the territory lord clapped his hands in celebration, it spread throughout the entire cathedral.`
`Then, a group of goats in the front line of the crowd took their masks off one by one...`
`"......N‐now listen here!`
` I won't stand for you making too much salty miso soup, understand?!`
` And George is getting a little overweight, so go easy on the sugar—"`
`"George! When a man gets married,`
` he's got to treasure his wife even more than his parents!`
` No matter what your mother says, you make sure you protect Shannon‐chan!"`
`"Yes, of course!!"`
`"George‐san...!!"`
`"G‐George needs a solid seven hours of sleep each night!`
` I'll never forgive you if you let him stay up late!!`
` And don't forget that washing his back and cleaning his ears are also a wife's responsibilities!!"`
`"I‐is that true...? Wh‐what have I done..."`
`"...Th‐that varies depending on the family......"`
`"Rudolf‐san, have you been properly caring for your wife?"`
`"Y‐you should know...`
` Why are you suspicious...?!"`
`"Find happiness, you two.`
` Marriage isn't the goal.`
` It's just the starting line, okay?"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!`
` Congratulations, congratulations!!"`
`"Uryuu!! Congratulaaaaaaatioons!!!"`
`"We can't let them beat us, can we?"`
`"Heh, heheheheheheh...!!`
` Y‐yeah, no way we're losing, dammii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}it!!"`
`All of the Ushiromiya family, all of the servants, and all of the spirits and demons in attendance...`
`...celebrated the honorees with even greater applause...`
`Thus, .........the tale woven by the Golden Witch comes to an end.`
`It seems proper to conclude the tale with the epitaph.`
`The following is the passage on the Golden Land from the Golden Witch's epitaph.`
`{e:070:The witch shall praise the wise, and bestow four treasures.`
`One shall be all of the Golden Land's gold.`
`One resurrects all the dead people's souls.`
`One even revives all the love they possessed.`
`And one for the witch to eternally rest.`
`Rest in peace, my beloved witch, {f:5:Beatrice}......}`
`"........................`
` ......So, this means Beato now rests fulfilled...?"`
`"That interpretation is probably appropriate..."`
`"And?`
` Now that the game is over, Onii‐chan will be released, right?`
` ......What will happen to him?"`
`"......Well, I wonder.`
` .........The book of this fragment tells no more of the story."`
`"............So, in the end, we don't even find out what happens to Onii‐chan.`
` .................."`
`......It's not as though anything will come out of it anyway.`
`In the end, Onii‐chan and the others never came back.`
`{n}They reached the Golden Land and enjoyed themselves there.`
`......So says the tale, ......but in reality,`
` .........everyone died......in that horrific accident......`
`"Still, .........I've learned a lot of very interesting things.`
` ......That island really is.........a crazy place of illusions."`
`"Indeed.`
` ......And your reading was truly wonderful..."`
`"......I feel worn out, like watching a six‐hour movie all at once.`
` ......I'm tired."`
`"Ushiromiya Ange.`
` You really have worked hard.`
` .........My boredom was eased by your reading.`
` The gratitude I feel towards you is one I have not felt since long before I stopped counting the years..."`
`"If you're grateful, why can't I have some kind of "commendation" too?"`
`"Hmm, what would be good...`
` ......Give me some time.`
` I will think."`
`{f:5:Featherine} sat down in her rocking chair and rocked it gently, apparently trying to think of something...`
`"......Ushiromiya Ange.`
` You really have worked hard.`
` ......You have done well to keep reading for me until the end.`
` ......With this, your responsibilities as my miko are lifted.`
` You may return to your original world and be reunited with the fate that you have been given."`
`"Sheesh.`
` ......Feels like this was one hell of a side‐trip."`
`"Do not pout.`
` I am thinking of a reward now......`
` ......Yes, why not, every once in a while...`
` .........That said, it has been quite some time.`
` ......I imagine the ink from the bottle has dried up by now......"`
`Even after the tale ended, Ange and Hachijo's debate over it continued for quite some time.`
`It was very serious......and fiery.`
`Ange had acknowledged that this tale was no crazy literary work,`
` ......but a new message bottle, which had drifted here once more from the Rokkenjima of twelve years previous to tell her of a single possible truth...`
`And.........it seemed as though she had found her own interpretation...`
`of the truth she thought the tale was trying to tell.`
`......Of course, that was only one truth,`
` and it did not mean an end to her journey.`
`Still, ......this interpretation had its place.`
`It wasn't sufficient to fill the twelve‐year gap in her heart.`
`......However, for now, ......she was content just to enjoy the feeling the tale had created...`
`along with the bitter coffee Hachijo had made.`
`"......Thank you for reading until the end.`
` ......And thank you for your thoughts and opinions.`
` ......I'm sure the very first Endless Witch is happy..."`
`".........Wow, so you can say stuff like that.`
` ......If you'd just talk like that from the beginning, I'll bet you'd have tons more fans."`
`"......I am merely praising the wonderful reader that you most certainly are.`
` ......I just wanted to say that rather than write for a silent readership of unthinking swine,`
` I would find it a much more productive use of my limited time on this earth to write a manuscript for you alone......`
` *giggle*."`
`"That's the kind of thing you don't have to say.`
` ......Well, I'll take it as a compliment.`
` .........Okay."`
`I get the feeling......that I've spent a really, really long time here.`
`It feels......as though I've spent a major fraction of my life here.`
`......It should feel uncomfortable, sitting here on a sofa in someone else's house,`
` ......but for some strange reason, it feels as familiar as my own home.`
`However, the clock shows that it's been only about two or three hours since I met her.`
` ......My sense of time feels very strange...`
`"......Your friend seems to be taking his time......"`
`"It must be a long phone call.`
` It's creepy for a guy to talk that long on the phone."`
`He said he was going to make a scheduled report to Okonogi‐san, didn't he?`
`Even though he was told that he could use the phone here, he declined, and went to look for a public phone somewhere.`
`......Something about how he didn't want to risk being bugged.`
` It was too ridiculous a point to argue, so I just left him to it.`
`"Is the public phone far?"`
`"If you go out onto the street, there's a store on the corner a short way down."`
`"Then I'll be on my way.`
` ......Here, consider this payment for the snacks or whatever."`
`"......If I let you keep that money,`
` will you come again, read my next manuscript, and tell me your opinions...?"`
`"......You're willing to pay rolls of money to get an uncouth girl like me to read your manuscript?"`
`"On the contrary,`
` you were a good reader and a good thinker.`
` ......It is in search of a person like you that we weave these tales and set them loose into the world."`
`".........You praise me too much.`
` I just take books a little too seriously."`
`"As thanks for the considerable time you have given to me,`
` .........I will someday write your tale."`
`"Am I going to appear in another of your Forgeries?`
` ......I hope you kill me in a slightly better way this time."`
`"......Do you...like miracles?"`
`"You mean story contrivances?`
` ......I used to hate them, but recently I've become a big fan.`
` I've been spoiled, though, so you'll have to one‐up jumping off a skyscraper and ending up unharmed, because I don't even count that as a miracle anymore."`
`".........Then, one day, perhaps, I will write you a tale that you will consider a miracle......"`
`"I'm......really sorry for barging in all of a sudden and saying all kinds of mean things."`
`"......Not at all. It was a worthwhile conversation.`
` ...Perhaps I will have my head editor arrange another meeting between the two of us......"`
`"If the opportunity presents itself.`
` <See you again, have a nice day>."`
`"Yes, it may happen again sometime.`
` ......I pray that you find your truth."`
`"Thank you."`
`"If you ever do reach your truth,`
` .........please try making your truth a tale as well someday..."`
`".........You want me to become one of you witches?`
` I'm not sure about that.`
` I'm bad at writing.`
` A good reader isn't necessarily a good writer, you know?"`
`"Ah, quite true.`
` I myself can never read anything written by anyone else."`
`"......Sheesh.`
` Then, I'm off."`
`"After this, I will probably never see you again,`
` ......but I pray I will be fortunate enough to meet another you somewhere...someday."`
`"...........................`
` Can I ask one last question?"`
`"Go ahead..."`
`".........That {f:5:Featherine} witch, who appeared within the tale.`
` ......That's...you, right?"`
`"It may be presumptuous to say it, but that was my intention."`
`"...........................`
` ......This might be a strange question, but......umm...`
` ...............Are you {f:5:Featherine}?`
` Or is {f:5:Featherine} you?"`
`"......Why,`
` ......I haven't the foggiest idea what you mean..."`
`The mysterious woman remained mysterious to the end.`
`.........And so I made it through a day I had no {i:memory} of, and the following day, I took a boat to Niijima.`
`I'll probably never see her again.`
`However, that just means that "I" won't see her—the other "me"s might, somewhere down the road.`
`......Just as "I" was able to reach several truths, I pray that they too......can reach their destinations.`
`So long, {f:5:Featherine}.`
`......If you ever write a better story, please call me again.`
`{n}If I'm free, I might drop by......`
`"No problem.`
` It's the cushiest escort job I've ever had.`
` ......I'd almost like to invite you along, sir."`
`"......I'll take a pass on that.`
` You know how old I am.`
` I'm done running around all over the place..."`
`The person on the other end of the line was Okonogi.`
`......Okonogi was also one who tended to move from place to place, so it hadn't been easy to catch him even on the phone.`
`"Our trip's been pretty <cool>, so right now, there's no need to run around."`
`"Sumadera Kasumi's searching like a madwoman for her.`
` ......According to my source, she's fixed herself a ride to Rokkenjima already.`
` You'll bump into her there."`
`"So, just as planned."`
`"...............It'll likely be just five or six people at most.`
` And they'll probably be armed with nothing more than handguns.`
` They're no match for you.`
` Feel free to run wild.`
` But make sure you kill them.`
` ......Have you received that favorite toy of yours?"`
`"Of course.`
` I'm surprised you managed to get this into the country."`
`Behind Amakusa was the rental car that they had borrowed under a false name,`
` ......inside of which was now a black golf bag.`
`"The Sumadera head family has already given the okay, but make sure you get out of Japan as soon as you're done.`
` Don't forget to buy your cup ramen by the box in Narita before your flight out."`
`"Heheheh, I'll take care this time.`
` .........It's an easy job."`
`"There's also............the other matter...... You understand me, right?"`
`"Other matter...`
` .........Well, now you've lost me."`
`"......Playing dumb, huh?`
` ......Well, whatever.`
` At the end of the day, you're a man who's never betrayed my expectations.`
` ......If you're clever about it, you won't even have to get your hands dirty.`
` ......There should be plenty of ways to handle it."`
`".......................................`
` ......Heheh, I'm not sure what you're talking about."`
`"......I know Ange‐chan's an unfortunate kid.`
` ......Still, all she had to do was play the part of a secluded, wealthy young lady.`
` ......Since Eva‐san's death, we've all been in agreement on uniting together going forward.`
` ......This little portable shrine of ours is important, ......but she's also a liability.`
` We're talking about world peace here, right?"`
`"............Well, let's see how it goes.`
` I hope those Sumadera black‐suits know how to shoot a gun right."`
`".............................."`
`"Hmm?`
` What is it, sir?"`
`"......Don't tell me that, after a few days on the run,`
` you and Ange‐chan have already hooked up...?"`
`"Ha.`
` .........Me and that bratty little girl? ...Please."`
`"Hey, it's not like I care.`
` It'd mean you've finally managed to move on, enough that you can take passes at women, at least.`
` ......Half the world is women, you know.`
` You'll never last if just one or two give you the jitters."`
`"..............................`
` ......Oh, speak of the devil.`
` She's here.`
` ............Guess that's all for today.`
` I'll contact you after I reach our lodgings on Niijima.`
` Later."`
`Ange walked down the street towards me.`
`Why'd she have to do that when I told her to wait for me to come back?`
`......If only she wasn't like this, she might have lived a long life.`
`"......That was a pretty long call.`
` I was so tired of waiting that I left."`
`"Heheh. Sorry about that.`
` ......How was it for you, missy?`
` Did you learn anything interesting...?"`
`"It was interesting.`
` .........That's all I got out of it."`
`"Hyahha...!`
` Sounds <cool>."`
`After Amakusa opened the passenger's side door, Ange got in the car.`
`{n}Amakusa quickly went around to the driver's seat.`
`".........Then let's head to the harbor.`
` According to the old man, the Sumadera family has set up a net."`
`"...............If we do get caught, then that's the measure of my luck.`
` ......If we don't, ......then Rokkenjima is waiting for me.`
` ......Let's leave it all to luck."`
`".........Luck, is it?"`
`"When you can't decide what to do,`
` or when it doesn't matter either way,`
` ......it's not so bad to entrust your fate to a coin toss."`
`"Heheh.`
` Then I'll leave it to luck too.`
` ............I'm no stranger to that sort of thing myself."`
`"......My bodyguard has just said he'll leave everything to luck.`
` This sucks."`
`"Since I had to leave for that phone call, I totally missed the clincher.`
` What happened after I left? Let's hear it."`
`"No, I'm not telling."`
`"That's a shame."`
`The car dashed through the hilly town...`
`{n}It would not return to Hachijo's house for all eternity.`
`However, Ange didn't get sentimental about it.`
`For now, ......she just wanted to silently consider the new message bottle...`
`...that the current Endless Witch, Hachijo Tohya, had given her...`
`In the rear‐view mirror, the town where a witch lived faded off into the distance.`
`However, that scene wasn't reflected in Ange's eyes......`
