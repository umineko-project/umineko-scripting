`"......Erika‐chan, huh.`
` She's an odd kid.`
` ...Somehow, I just can't seem to get along well with the young kids these days."`
`"*giggle*.`
` You're still pretty young yourself, George‐san."`
`"Hahaha...`
` I guess it's because I've always been the oldest of the cousins...`
` It's always made me feel like I'm not one of the young ones anymore."`
`George and Shannon could be seen surrounded by the rainy rose garden.`
`{n}Though the rain was still pouring down, there was hardly any wind at all.`
`The scant protection provided by the arbor was more than enough to house this secret meeting between lovers.`
`Following that fight with Erika, the group had decided to play some cards for a change of pace.`
`When that was over, Shannon returned to the servant room,`
` .....and shortly after that, George left the room as well to meet Shannon here at the time they had arranged.`
`"I think kids around Erika‐san's age have a really hard time accepting themselves."`
`"......Yeah, that's true.`
` Around that age, most kids are so determined to break out of the shell of childhood that they lash out in all directions with their beaks.`
` Only once they manage to break through can they finally stretch their wings and fly high.`
` ......I was like that too.`
` When I was still inside that shell, I was a weak, deplorable man who didn't deserve any respect."`
`"Th‐that's not true..."`
`"No, it's okay.`
` I realize it myself.`
` Back then, I might have been the oldest of the cousins, but I was still a lazy, hopeless man.`
` ......And it wasn't just with the cousins.`
` At home, at school—I was like that everywhere."`
`......I hated being like that.`
`I wanted to break that shell and become a splendid adult like Mother and Father.`
`"But in the end, ......you did break out of that shell, George‐sama.`
` ......Every time I've met you these past few years, you've grown beyond recognition."`
`"Thank you."`
`"......Did something cause you to make up your mind?"`
`"To break out of my shell?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......I can't imagine that you grew so rapidly, like a butterfly breaking out of its cocoon,`
` by just wandering around aimlessly.`
` ......I thought there must have been some turning point which made you become so determined."`
`"......I fell in love with you, and grew thanks to the power of love...is what I've told you so far.`
` Haha, ......but the truth is, the turning point was a much more negative emotion."`
`"No way......`
` It's hard to believe that someone who's always as bright and cheerful as you could have negative emotions."`
`"Well,`
` ......my parents taught me to treat girls well.`
` And I thought that I had succeeded in living that way."`
`"Yes.`
` I think you're a really wonderful gentleman..."`
`"But that was wrong."`
`".........?"`
`"I didn't know how to interact with the opposite sex.`
` I deified them excessively......and though I always behaved in a gentlemanly, ladies first kind of way,`
` I was probably outright afraid of interacting with girls."`
`Of course, George had wanted to be around girls as much as any boy might.`
`However, he didn't know how to interact with them.`
` He wanted to act like a gentleman, avoid being disliked by them, and treat them with care.`
`Of those feelings, only the words "treat girls well" took precedence,`
` blossoming into a subconscious fear of women...`
`"You might call a man like that "gentlemanly" or "a late bloomer".`
` .........Ridiculous.`
` I was just a coward.`
` Because of that, I started to wonder why I couldn't get a lover if I was so gentlemanly,`
` and I eventually came to the conclusion that all the women in the world had no taste, and started to hate all of them...stupidly.`
` .........That's what a truly pathetic man looks like."`
`How many years ago was it when I noticed?`
` It started when I was in middle school.`
`At the time, I assumed that I was obviously the most gentlemanly of the cousins, so I would obviously be popular with women.`
`However, reality was completely different.`
`At school, I was pretty much completely hopeless.`
`......Far from being a leader, I was the bullied kid who got pushed around by everyone.`
`At the time, I figured I was just a capable and adaptable man, who could keep in perfect tune with his surroundings.`
` ......How stupid.`
`Sure, I might have gained some measure of trust from girls.`
`......However, not only was there no one who would become my girlfriend, I didn't even know any girls I could call a friend.`
`"Of course.`
` ......I was a man who always took a step back from girls, under the pretense of ladies first.`
` Who would ever want to stand behind such a negative, unmotivated man?`
` ...It's funny.`
` I didn't even realize this, and thought I was a pretty attractive guy."`
`".........I can sort of understand how you felt.`
` ...Just because someone puts in a lot of hard work to look attractive to the opposite sex,`
` it doesn't mean it will necessarily work out as they planned."`
`"Oh?`
` ......Has that happened to you too, Shannon?"`
`"Of course.`
` ......One time, I wanted to catch a boy's eye so much, I tried to put on makeup even though I didn't know how and embarrassed myself...`
` ......Eheheh, I remember a lot of embarrassing failures."`
`"The person that made me finally get over my conceit and open my eyes......was you, Shannon.`
` ......No, it was all of you."`
`".........What was the turning point for you, George‐san?"`
`"Haha,`
` ......envy, probably."`
`"That's unexpected.`
` ......But envy for what?"`
`"I saw you and Battler‐kun having a really good time talking.`
` ......That made me envious."`
`"............Me and...Battler‐sama?"`
`Shannon raced through her memories, trying to find a conversation that might have made George envious.`
`"Haha, it probably seemed trivial to you two.`
` However, it still made me envious.`
` ......I don't want Battler‐kun to hear what I say next, no matter what.`
` Can you promise me?"`
`"O‐of course..."`
`".....................`
` ......It's going to be a shameful confession.`
` ...Still, I want you to hear it.`
` I want to hear your answer tonight...only after I've told you about my bad sides as well."`
`"............Okay.`
` ......Let me hear it."`
`With a smile but a serious look in her eyes, Shannon nodded.`
`Tonight.`
` ......She knew what he was going to ask her tonight.`
`George had the right to confess before asking that sacred question, and Shannon had the obligation to listen.`
`Shannon understood this, ......so she listened quietly.`
`"So this is what a Witch of Theatergoing peeps in on during her spare time?"`
`"......Stories of love are truly timeless.`
` I never tire of them.`
` ......However, I do find that maidenly expression of disgust on your face even more charming..."`
`{f:5:Featherine} laughed quietly.`
`Ange huffed and looked away,`
` but she quickly realized that this would only entertain {f:5:Featherine} even more, so she tried to act unconcerned...`
`"Both Battler‐kun and Jessica‐chan have always been spirited.`
` ......No, phrasing it that way is just dodging the point.`
` ......Let me be frank."`
`George looked up at where the moon should be, high above the rain clouds...and spoke.`
`They were honest words, spoken from George's meek heart...`
`"......For a long time back then,`
` I thought of Battler‐kun and Jessica‐chan...`
`as bad‐mannered kids.`
` ......No, let me be more direct.`
` ......I thought that even the way they talked was vulgar.`
` .........It's true.`
` I don't mind if you hold me in contempt for that."`
`"I don't.`
` ......People are allowed to think anything they want inside their hearts.`
` In fact, I think you were all the more commendable for not letting it show on the outside."`
`"Thanks.`
` .........I secretly looked down on those two.`
` I was so conceited that I truly thought I was just overflowing with gentlemanly charm compared to them."`
`I was at that age where having a girlfriend felt like a necessary condition for becoming a real man.`
`I truly believed that no girl could fail to admire a gentleman who treated girls as well as I did.`
`So, I really did assume that the girls I knew were attracted to me.`
`"I thought that Battler‐kun and Jessica‐chan, who always joked around and spoke in a rude, vulgar fashion,`
` would never be able to get a boyfriend or girlfriend.`
` ......I might have used that argument to distract myself when I still couldn't get a girlfriend."`
`"......I was a fool.`
` They weren't inferior to me at all.`
` I was the inferior one, with my deification of the opposite sex and my fear, which I hid under the guise of "ladies first"."`
`"That's been Battler's and Jessica's personality from the beginning.`
` True, they were rude, and one couldn't have called them gentlemanly or ladylike.`
` ......However, they did have the power to interact without worrying about their sexes.`
` ...In fact, you might even call that their charm."`
`".........I sort of understand.`
` People like Onii‐chan and Jessica onee‐chan can get along with anyone whether that person's a boy or a girl.`
` ......Apologies to George onii-chan, but...guys who try too hard to act like a "gentleman"...I find them a bit creepy.`
` ......It's like they have delusions about women or something..."`
`"People respect it when someone they are distant from is boring and harmless.`
` However, they only like that person because he or she doesn't get in their way.`
` ......No human being would want to deepen their connection with a boring person."`
`"......Of course.`
` No idiot would want to be friends with an unmoving, unspeaking telephone pole.`
` ......However, unmoving and unspeaking is exactly what you'd want from a telephone pole."`
`"That's it.`
` It seems as though George finally discovered that he wouldn't be viewed as an attractive man no matter how superior he was,`
` and that he had been treated like a telephone pole the whole time..."`
`"Back then, my conceit was at its peak.`
` ......So, when everyone gathered at the family conferences,`
` I believed that I was the most attractive, and that all the servant girls who played with us were in love with me.`
` .........And then the day came when I finally realized how pathetic I was."`
`".........Did I...say something inconsiderate then......?"`
`"No, it's the opposite.`
` .........You didn't say anything at all.`
` My conceited delusion that I was the only one ever reflected in your eyes...was crushed."`
`Just when did it start?`
`{n}......No, it must have started long before then.`
`I only failed to notice because my eyes were clouded with conceit.`
`"......One day, I suddenly realized it.`
` ......You guys were getting along with Battler‐kun and Jessica‐chan far better than with me,`
` ......playing around and having a good time."`
`......Yes.`
` Those two, whom I had looked down upon so much, were radiating far more charm than I was.`
`You really looked like you were enjoying yourself that day.`
`The look on your face was far brighter than any you ever showed me.`
`"Hahaha, sickening, isn't it?`
` ......I just assumed that you liked me,`
` and even had some childish fantasy that we might end up dating."`
`"Based on nothing at all, I felt as though my girlfriend had been stolen from me and let myself feel hurt.`
` .........Just how pathetic was I at that moment...`
` ......When that happened, I finally realized how foolish I had been."`
`".........George‐sama......"`
`"After that, stuff happened and Battler‐kun stopped coming to the family conferences, but I heard about him from time to time from Uncle Rudolf.`
` ......Uncle Rudolf cares more than he shows.`
` Even though he gets in fights with Battler‐kun all the time, ...he's always paid close attention to his son's goings‐on."`
`"......Yes.`
` I've heard similar things.`
` ......Even Asumu‐sama despaired at how alike they were.`
` ......She was sure that Rudolf‐sama's blood was to blame for all the trouble caused by Battler‐sama's popularity with the girls at school."`
`"And Jessica‐chan too.`
` I'd heard that she'd built up a huge number of friends, both boys and girls, and that she was always the center of attention.`
` ......When I actually talked with her, I realized that this was no exaggeration."`
`That experience had......shown that the two I had looked down upon...`
`...were much more attractive human beings than I was...`
`"At first, I tried to imitate those two.`
` ......It was pretty ridiculous.`
` I thought that by joking around and speaking rudely, I could get that same charm they had."`
`"*giggle*.`
` ......You did that?`
` It's a bit hard to picture."`
`"It was pathetic...`
` I wish I could forget that time for the rest of my life.`
` In any event, I quickly realized that I would never gain any true charm by imitating them like that."`
`......I called it "respecting people",`
` I called it "acting to fit in with the general atmosphere",`
` .........but actually I was always just running away, and this cowardice was the reason for my lack of charm.`
`I resolved myself to overcome that flaw and be reborn.`
`......I finally understood the shell I was in, and I swore to break out of it.`
`Every time my resilience began to waver, ......I would remember that day.`
` ......That day I saw you all forget about me entirely and play around happily.`
` And the fact that those eyes of yours, which I always assumed were attracted to me, never noticed me at all.`
`.........I made an oath.`
` This time, I would really make you take notice of me, and I would be reflected in your eyes.`
` ......The truth is...that was the very first emotion, the start of me falling in love with you.`
`"...............It must have been...complicated."`
`"That day, I felt a desire for revenge against you all—no, against you specifically—for playing as a group and ignoring me.`
` And before I knew it, that emotion had transformed into true love."`
`"......However, I swear this to God.`
` Even though that was the reason I first started to take you seriously,`
` ......there are no lies in the way I feel about you now."`
`"......I swear to love you for all my life.`
` I will not lie about that for anyone or anything.`
` And I am prepared to take you as my wife, even if it means having the entire world as my enemy."`
`"......George...san......"`
`"That is the confession I wanted to make to you beforehand.`
` ......Before now, I've called you my first love, love at first sight.`
` ......That was a lie.`
` ...It was only my selfish, twisted—"`
`"That doesn't matter."`
`Shannon smiled,`
` ......but she spoke forcefully enough to interrupt George's words.`
`"Is there some rule saying that people can't get together just because they weren't each other's first love...?`
` Is it betrayal to forget the first person you fell in love with...?`
` Love......isn't that simple.`
` Well, ......it might be simple.`
` ......After all, love is easy.`
` ......Always, whatever you feel now...`
`...only the honest feelings you feel now can tell you the right answer.`
` So, things of the past or how our relationship started aren't important at all."`
`"......Then, ...I confessed for nothing...?"`
`"*giggle*, no.`
` ......I'm a bit glad to learn that even George‐san, who's always perfect at everything, has a human side to him.`
` ......And it makes me happy to know that I'm the only person you've told this to."`
`".........Thank you.`
` ...I was only able to become who I am because of you."`
`"Me too.`
` I am as I am because of you, George‐san.`
` ......So please, tell me without holding back.`
` ......What kind of husband and wife will we be,`
` ......and what kind of future will we build together?"`
`"When I have you as my wife,`
` I will become an even more accomplished businessman than my father.`
` ......And through all kinds of challenges and adventures, I hope to explore the limits of my potential.`
` I want to reach that peak together with you.`
` ......The view from there will be something no one can show you but me."`
`"It sounds fun.`
` ......I'll be with you wherever you go."`
`"Of course, it won't only be an adventure as a businessman.`
` ...I'd like to create many things that only a couple can make."`
`"*giggle*.`
` ......And what could that be?"`
`"Let's have some kids."`
`"*giggle*.`
` .........Yes, my husband."`
`"I'd like three of them at the least.`
` At least one boy and one girl."`
`"And what if all three are boys...?"`
`"Then the next one might be a girl.`
` We can make a fourth one.`
` ......It doesn't matter how many.`
` Let's enjoy the adventure of bringing them up together.`
` And when those children eventually leave their nest, they'll make us some grandchildren.`
` Before we know it, we'll reach a boisterous old age surrounded by many children and grandchildren."`
`"It sounds like fun.`
` I wonder......what kind of a grandpa you'll be."`
`"And I wonder what kind of a grandma you'll be.`
` However, I will always keep loving you.`
` ......And when we eventually pass away, surrounded by our vast family, our lives will stretch behind us, unmatched by anyone else's."`
`George didn't just talk about his love in the present.`
`He swore to love her soul until the final moment...`
`when the lids of their coffins would be shut.`
`Then, George took a small box out of his pocket.`
`{n}......Even without opening it, she knew what was inside.`
`He took it out with a motion that was more natural even than the one he had practiced in the bathroom at the airport,`
` and it was overflowing with charm.`
`"Sayo."`
`"Yes."`
`"Let's get married."`
`"Yes."`
`"Please, take this ring and put it on your finger."`
`".........Yes, George‐san."`
`That ring, which glistened divinely even in the dim light of the arbor,`
` ......passed from George's hand to Shannon's finger.`
`Of course, Shannon had already decided which finger to put it on.`
`"I swear to resolutely stand against any fate which may attempt to get in the way of our future."`
`George proclaimed that he would reveal their engagement to the entire family on the next day.`
`"My parents might criticize this marriage.`
` ......However, I will not let them stop us.`
` I am going to inform them of our engagement, not ask for their permission.`
` If Mother says that she will not allow our marriage,`
` I plan to have myself disinherited, and we will leave this family together."`
`"I have been prepared for that since long ago.`
` ......I swear once again to resolutely stand against all fates that get in the way of our future."`
`......George had said it aloud.`
`So, Shannon said the same thing.`
`"Me too.`
` ......I swear to stand against all fates that get in the way of our future."`
`"*giggle*giggle*.`
` ......Battler‐saaan, when will the crimes start?`
` I've just about had enough of this love show."`
`".....................`
` ......Be quiet and watch."`
`"......Sure, fine.`
` I'd hate to yawn and let some spectacular bit of foreshadowing slip by."`
`"............Do you have no love?"`
`"Are there any mysteries which accept love as proof?`
` No, there aren't."`
`Erika laughed coldly and stared down at the two on the game board.`
`Battler watched her quietly.`
`......Erika thought she felt a touch of pity in his gaze, and she averted her eyes uncomfortably.`
`"........................`
` ...I do understand, more or less.`
` Love can at least become a motive for murder.`
` ......I can interpret this scene beneath the arbor to represent a possible motive for the crime if their engagement is somehow impeded."`
`".........Then again, no matter how much people talk of love with words that aren't red, it's all just an illusion.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`".........That's very sad.`
` ......You can't even love anyone without proof given to you by a witch."`
`"Please put an end to this frivolous romance talk.`
` I am your enemy, not some eccentric friend of yours content to engage with your ramblings about love."`
`"..........................."`
`"I can't understand you at all anymore.`
` ......What on Earth did you figure out?`
` Weren't you and Beato always insulting and trying to kill each other?"`
`"......What kind of truth could you have reached to make you change your emotions regarding her?`
` ......Please don't tell me that feelings of true love have sprouted from your murderous rivalry or something ridiculous like that."`
`"......Lady {f:5:Erika}.`
` Let us have him continue the game's {f:5:progression}.`
` Boring love scenes such as this are best finished {f:5:quickly}."`
`"Ah, you've got a point there.`
` Sorry for butting in.`
` Come on, let's move on."`
`".............................."`
`"......It's Shannon.`
` I've come back."`
`"Mm.`
` ......The log for today hasn't been filled out yet."`
`"Yes.`
` I'll do that right away.`
` ......Kanon‐kun, thanks for keeping an eye out while I was gone."`
`"........................`
` ......That was a pretty long break."`
`Kanon had already noticed.`
` ......There was a silvery glint coming from the ring finger on Shannon's left hand.`
`"Then I will retire.`
` ......Please do not hesitate to wake me if anything occurs."`
`""Goodnight, Genji‐sama.""`
`Genji disappeared off to the waiting room.`
`......After that, only Shannon and Kanon remained.`
`"......Thanks for giving me some time.`
` I'll be staying here, so you can take a break now if you want."`
`"..............................`
` ......In other words, it's my turn now."`
`".........Yeah.`
` ......Sorry, ......but we aren't going to lose."`
`"And I......won't lose either......"`
`"Even though you've always been a coward and let Milady take the lead until now...?"`
`"............Wasn't it you who taught me, Nee‐san?"`
`"What did I teach you...?"`
`"The past is immaterial when it comes to love.`
` The present is all that's important.`
` If that is true, then I think my present is in no way inferior to yours, Nee‐san."`
`Shannon and Kanon glared at each other with serious eyes.`
`{n}That period of tension vanished when Shannon chuckled.`
`"......Yeah, that's good.`
` ......You and Milady have to give it your all.`
` ......If you do end up together,`
` ......make sure you build up a relationship wonderful enough that we can cheer you on with all our hearts."`
`"Well, you do have a huge lead on me."`
`"......Nothing to be done about that.`
` That's what you get for your cowardice before now."`
`"I know.`
` ......That is my...sin."`
`Shannon and Kanon fished around in their pockets, ......and drew out two small things that glittered gold.`
`They looked like......the left and right wings of a gold butterfly.`
`"We are furniture.`
` ......In order to become {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} and receive the miracle that allows us to love, ......we must rely on a miracle of magic once again."`
`"......To think that her brooch would prove useful."`
`"It's the only magic within our reach."`
`It was the golden butterfly brooch,`
` which {f:5:Beatrice} had once given to Shannon in the hopes of creating love between her and George.`
`Shannon had given it to Kanon, but he had let his emotions get ahold of him and had crushed it into pieces.`
`So, when the two wings they held were brought together, ......it would regain the form of a beautiful butterfly.`
`"......Then I'll be back soon.`
` ......After all, they have asked me to play cards with them."`
`"Yeah.`
` Good luck.`
` ......I'm sure Milady will be happy."`
`"......It's a bit embarrassing."`
`"Enjoy it.`
` That feeling."`
`Kanon left the servant room.`
` ......He went to go see Jessica and tell her what he had determined to do.`
`Shannon quietly watched him go.`
`The fragment of the brooch and the engagement ring let off a gold and silver glint......`
`"That takes me back.`
` That's something I gave Shannon, if I recall.`
` ......I always wondered where that disappeared to after Kanon stepped on it, but it seems they still had it all the time."`
`"......That's the golden butterfly brooch, isn't it?`
` ......I read about the magical brooch that can save a love relationship in {f:5:Featherine}‐san's book."`
`And that had been the first moment that {f:5:Beatrice}, witch of the forest,`
` had met with a human and given them her power.`
`Bit by bit, she had ascended from a mere ghost to the ruler of the mansion at night,`
` ......and by making the servants believe in her, she had wiped away the anti‐magic power.`
`And then, ......it eventually became possible for her to appear openly in front of Shannon,`
` whose magic resistance had grown particularly low and who had begun to believe in the existence of {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`To Beato, who had been unable to interact with anyone for many years, this conversation with Shannon must have been especially fun...`
`"That's why I generously gave her the butterfly brooch.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*, I was in quite a good mood.`
` ...It is no common thing for a heartless witch such as myself to be so gracious."`
`"But it's wonderful.`
` You brought a pair of future lovers together."`
`"Of course, I did not do it to pamper them.`
` ......It was in exchange for smashing that hateful spirit mirror that had repressed my magical powers.`
` Thanks to that, I was able to regain much of my power all in one go."`
`"But then, one night, purple lightning smashed the shrine.`
` Those of the surrounding islands called it an evil omen.`
` Oooh, now that I think of it, that must have been a prelude to {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's resurrection."`
`Kumasawa had the rest of the night off.`
`So, she had let Erika talk her into drinking a bit,`
` and was chatting about the legend of Akujikijima and {f:5:Beatrice} in a happy, tipsy mood.`
`Erika would nod from time to time, but she listened very closely.`
`She wasn't actually taking notes, but she was gathering the information on the whiteboard inside her head.`
`......Then, she frowned as though noticing something out of place and held up her hand.`
`"Wait a second."`
`"Yes?"`
`"......That shrine was built by a traveling mountaineering ascetic to seal up the evil spirits of Akujikijima.`
` Isn't that right?"`
`"Yes, that is correct.`
` It was one who possessed a vast supernatural power, and who placed that power within the mirror—"`
`"And placed it within the shrine as a sacred mirror to seal the evil spirits.`
` ......Something feels off about that.`
` ......Why would a shrine to seal the evil spirits of Akujikijima also seal {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"W‐......well...`
` That's, uh, because the power of the sacred mirror..."`
`"......I see.`
` So it's this really convenient sacred mirror that works on both evil spirits from the East and witches from the West.`
` ......Got it.`
` I'm still not satisfied, but I'll back off there for now.`
` What I don't understand is why {f:5:Beatrice} can't stand spiderwebs."`
`According to the legend, the evil spirits of Akujikijima despised spiderwebs,`
` so they were apparently used as wards against evil on the islands around here.`
`Actually, spiders are a useful bug.`
`{n}The farmers of the islands may well have treasured them.`
`It's very possible that the farmers called them wards against evil, tying them to the stories about evil spirits,`
` in order to create a tradition of people treating this useful bug with care through the generations...`
`"But that's just the legend of Akujikijima.`
` The origins for the legend of the witch {f:5:Beatrice} came after Ushiromiya Kinzo moved to this island,`
` when rumors sprouted about the mysterious legend of the gold and his mistress who gave it to him as a witch."`
`"In other words, the evil spirits of Akujikijima and the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} are completely different things.`
` And yet, the same things are said about them."`
`"W‐......well now......"`
`The evil spirits of Akujikijima couldn't stand spiderwebs.`
` So neither could {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}That sort of reasoning has been applied all over the place.`
`......When it was pointed out that this was strange, Kumasawa was lost for an answer...`
`"The doorknob to Kinzo‐san's study has a scorpion magic circle drawn on it, which represents a charm against magic in Western sorcery.`
` That's why the Western witch {f:5:Beatrice} can't touch it.`
` ......I can understand that part."`
`"But there's no reason for {f:5:Beatrice} to dislike spiderwebs.`
` I don't remember spiderwebs ever being included among things Western witches can't stand.`
` On the contrary, wouldn't spiders be the friends and minions of a witch?"`
`"W‐......well......"`
`"In my opinion,`
` ......these two legends about the evil spirits of Akujikijima and the witch {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`have become a little mixed together.`
` In fact, maybe they've been fully joined together as one."`
`"......The legend of Akujikijima is a fairy tale created by fishermen fearful of reefs in the Rokkenjima area.`
` However, there was no visual image to go along with those evil spirits.`
` Were they people, or monsters, or ghosts without legs?`
` There's no mental picture of them.`
` People are bad at imagining things without visuals.`
` ......And then the legend of the witch called {f:5:Beatrice} came in."`
`"A witch is a lot easier to picture than evil spirits.`
` And on top of that, Kinzo‐san had a portrait of {f:5:Beatrice} drawn and displayed.`
` In other words, the lack of a visual image, which was the one weak point in the legend of Akujikijima, was finally completed.`
` Perhaps the two legends became mixed together at some point after that."`
`"W‐well, I wonder......`
` ...H‐......hohoho...`
` It is a bit confusing for an old lady such as myself..."`
`Kumasawa laughed to smooth it over, wiping away a cold sweat...`
`She might have seemed confused, but she actually did understand what Erika was saying.`
`......In truth, she did have a rough understanding of how the legend of Akujikijima, which had been around before Ushiromiya Kinzo had come to Rokkenjima,`
` and the legend of the Golden Witch, the story of the woman who had given Kinzo a vast quantity of gold,`
` ......had changed over time.`
`She didn't want to admit it, ......but she knew.`
`{f:5:Beatrice}'s "backstory", that she hated the spirit mirror and spiderwebs...`
`...had actually been based on the ancient legend of Akujikijima.`
`The "evil spirits" part of that legend had just been replaced by the witch of the portrait......`
`"......So,`
` if there really was someone claiming to be the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice},`
` I'd really like to ask her...`
`whether she actually does hate spiderwebs or not.`
` ......What happens when she touches them?"`
`"I‐it is said that witches and their minions...`
`......receive burns when they touch spiderwebs...`
`...so that is probably what would happen, I would say..."`
`"Hmph, that's not bad.`
` A splendid witch trial.`
` ......If the spiderweb touches her and she gets burned,`
` then she's an evil spirit, not a witch.`
` ......And if nothing happens, then it proves she's just a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}."`
`"In other words, .........whether she's burned or not,`
` it will prove that the Golden Witch doesn't exist.`
` ......The legend of the witch is nothing more than the legend of Akujikijima re‐boiled with a new face on it."`
`".........W‐.........well........."`
`"All it takes is the presence of a legend, and a deduction like this becomes trivial for Furudo Erika.`
` Your thoughts, ladies and gentlemen......?"`
`Though only the two of them were in the lounge,`
` Erika faced in the direction an invisible audience would have been if there was one,`
` and shrugged...`
`And, to match Erika's imagination,`
` .........the two of them actually were there, listening in...`
`".........Spiderwebs...?`
` They burn if you touch them......?"`
`"..........................."`
`When Beato the Elder snapped her fingers,`
` ......a graceful silver spider slipped down from the ceiling, hanging by a transparent thread.`
`Afterwards, only a single silver strand remained.`
`"..................Umm........."`
`Timidly,`
` ......Beato stretched her finger out towards the spider's string...`
`And she............touched it......`
`".....................`
` ......I'm fine."`
`".........You are?"`
`"Huh......?"`
`Beato the Elder lifted up a white, pale finger, and after showing it to her little sister,`
` ......she traced the silver string with it.`
`...There was a stench like a single hair being burnt.`
`Once again, she held her finger up in front of Beato, who was dumbfounded.`
`There was a thin burn line, as though someone had traced across it with a razor......`
`"What......does this mean...?"`
`"That's what I would like to know.`
` Why are you unharmed?"`
`"I, I don't know.`
` ......What I don't understand is why you do get burnt by touching a spiderweb..."`
`"......I do not know.`
` It has always been like that since I first gained consciousness."`
`"Then, .........are you........."`
`Beato hesitated.`
`......However, her question was clear.`
`"No.`
` I am not one of the evil spirits of Akujikijima.`
` I am {f:5:Beatrice}, ruler of Rokkenjima's night.`
` ......Even I do not know why I have the same weakness as this island's evil spirits of old..."`
`"Are spiderwebs the only things you can't handle...?"`
`"As this Erika said, I can't touch the doorknob to Kinzo's study.`
` That scorpion magic circle burns me.`
` ......For me, trying to open the door to that study is like trying to pick a red‐hot horseshoe out of a fire.`
` .........What about you?"`
`"Huh?`
` Scorpion magic circles, you mean......?"`
`The older sister snapped her fingers again.`
`When she did, the surrounding scene bent and twisted, and they had suddenly moved to the place in front of Kinzo's study.`
`And there......was the doorknob engraved with the scorpion magic circle.`
`"Those who research sorcery must have a refuge sealed off from both human and spiritual disturbances.`
` ......It is no surprise that Kinzo chose to seal off his study and place a charm such as this here.`
` ......And, unfortunately, that affects me as well, as I will show you..."`
`She gently grasped the doorknob.`
`As she did, a violent burning sound, unbelievably stronger than the one caused by the spiderweb, rang out.`
`"O‐Onee‐sama, are you okay...?!`
` Your hand......aaaaaaahhh...!!"`
`Her hand......had been horribly burnt, and Beato couldn't help but avert her eyes...`
`"Fear not.`
` This scratch will heal quickly."`
`Apparently, it would heal by itself if left alone.`
`{n}......The older sister seemed to heal at an inhuman rate.`
`"However,`
` ......it seems that you can handle it just fine."`
`"..................G‐`
`......go."`
`She timidly poked the doorknob.`
` ......Nothing happened.`
`Slowly, ......she touched it with her entire palm, but she felt nothing but a pleasantly cool sensation.`
`"......Strange.`
` ......Though you are my double, you are different from me in several ways."`
`"While I might be able to touch the doorknob,`
` ......if I ever get burnt like you did, I don't think I would heal that easily..."`
`".........It's as though you're a normal {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}."`
`"Y‐yes.`
` ......Even I find it a little hard to believe that I'm a witch...`
` ......I can't use magic like you, and I can't get strange burns or heal from them later..."`
`".........Father believed...`
`...that I was a great witch reborn...`
`...but...`
`...I cannot believe that......"`
`"......Who are you?"`
`"I, I am {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......I was born for Father's sake.`
` ......And you, Onee‐sama?"`
`"I am also {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I used magic to give Kinzo gold, and later became a soul and the formless witch that haunts this island."`
`"..................Just who on Earth...`
`...are we......?"`
`"......Unlike me, it seems that you possess a body."`
`"Huh?`
` Really......?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......It occurred to me while listening to that Erika person.`
` ......I am a witch who can use magic but has no body,`
` ......and you are a witch who has a body but can use no magic.`
` .........Eventually, perhaps we will become one, each filling in what the other lacks, and become the true, complete {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"................................."`
`It did seem plausible.`
`Both of the {f:5:Beatrice}s were missing something.`
`If they were to become one, then surely they would be very close to the {f:5:Beatrice} that Battler desired...`
`"......Do you want...to try?"`
`"............Huh...?"`
`"Hold out your hand."`
`The older sister slowly raised her palm and held it out before Beato.`
`The large burn from a second ago really had started to heal already...`
`"It may be possible for us to become one.`
` I want to know as well.`
` By becoming one with you, ......I want to learn about my future self."`
`".............................."`
`Beato also raised her hand slowly,`
` .........and the two hands...`
`...touched......`
`..............................`
`......But nothing happened.`
`Perhaps this meant that, while they were fated to become one eventually, that time had not yet come......`
`"......For me, being burned by spiderwebs is perfectly normal.`
` However, you didn't even know about it.`
` ......In the same way, you say that the reason you were born was for your father's sake.`
` ......Apparently, that father is Ushiromiya Battler."`
`"I know him as a rare guest who only comes a few times a year,`
` but I cannot understand what connection you and I have with such an infrequent guest.`
` ......Surely, we must learn more about each other."`
`"Y‐yeah, you're right...`
` ......I get the feeling that learning about each other......will lead us to something very important."`
`"On the other side lies the single future {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......No, it may be more correct to say that it is the true form we are supposed to possess."`
`With their hands still joined, the two {f:5:Beatrice}s swore to fill in the parts the other lacked...`
`and regain their single form.`
`......Bit by bit, .........Beato was walking down the path that led to the former {f:5:Beatrice}...`
