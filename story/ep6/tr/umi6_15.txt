`The entrance to the mansion was locked, but Erika had a master key, so she opened it without any trouble.`
`She had gotten Krauss and the others to take the master keys from the servants,`
` and at that time, she had used a little sleight of hand to pilfer one of them...`
`"Well {f:5:then}.`
` Where shall we go {f:5:first}?"`
`"Why ask?`
` ......Let's go and hear Battler‐san's answer."`
`Grinning, Erika cut across the entrance hall, passed by the dining hall, and headed deeper and deeper into the mansion.`
`......She headed for the guest room Battler had lain dead in.`
`Battler could put off deciding whether the seals would remain intact or not until the moment right before Erika witnessed them.`
`However, once she did witness them, ......the Game Master would have to show what had happened to them.`
`In the witch's game they were in now, ......the simple act of going to check the seals around the guest room was an attack.`
`".........Are you ready, Lord {f:5:Battler}?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Or as you would say it,`
` ............come, step forward."`
`"<Good>!`
` Then allow me to examine your response.`
` So, let's see, ......are the seals broken or are they not?`
` Has the locked room been preserved, ......or has it not...?!"`
`The piece Erika held high in the air......was the white queen, which represented herself.`
`Her target......was Battler's territory.`
` She cut straight in...!`
`Erika dashed down the hallway with a sickening smile and clung to the guest room door like a spider.`
`Then, she closely examined the seals she had placed retroactively.`
`"............Heh...`
`...heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eeh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eeh{0}heh!`
` ......Are you sure...?`
` .........Are you sure,`
` ...Battler‐saaaaaaan...?!"`
`"I‐......is this alright, Battler‐san...?"`
`"......Yeah, I can't back down here.`
` ......After all, even if I'm sealed in here, ......there are ways of placing the letter."`
`"But Erika is probably about to enter the guest room.`
` And then, she will observe your dead body.`
` ......What are you going to do?!`
` If the body is there, then there's no problem.`
` ......The letter's prediction will have missed, but it's not as though there's a penalty for that.`
` ......But you......intend to fight this head on...!"`
`"There are times...`
`...when a man is challenged head on...that he has to respond, no matter what it is he's up against."`
`"......I must not...pull back here.`
` .........I'll take this challenge.`
` I can search for a way out all I want to later...!`
` I managed to do that with Kinzo's study last time...!`
` .........It'll be fine... I can do this...! I can do it!!`
` Do your worst, Erikaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa!!!"`
`"{p:1:We have confirmed that the seals to the guest room are {f:5:undamaged}.`
` Since the time Lady {f:5:Erika} confirmed Battler's presence, this locked room has been {f:5:preserved}}."`
`"<Good>!!`
` I'm breaking the seals!!`
` Rip, tear!!`
` Heh, hehi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!!!"`
`Erika destroyed the duct tape seal on the door in ecstasy...`
`It looked as though the intellectual rapist had finally laid her true nature bare.`
`"......Okay,`
` ......I'm opening it......`
` Show me,`
` ......Battler‐san,`
` ......your naked scenario...!!`
` Hehihi{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!!"`
`Like a ruffian pushing down a weak girl,`
` ......Erika mercilessly and greedily threw the door open.`
`Then, finally, ......the inside of Battler's guest room was observed by Erika.`
`Battler had to show it.`
`.........Was there a corpse, or wasn't there?`
`"<Come ooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oon>, Battleee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}er{-}r{-}r{-}r{-}r{-}r{-}r{-}r!!"`
`"Aaaaaaaaaaahhh, here's my respooooooonse!!"`
`Battler grabbed a black piece from the board and raised it high.`
`......Aah, ......that piece.........`
`Beato had no memories of the time she had been an expert at this game.`
`And yet, ......for some reason, she realized that this was a move from which there would be no coming back.`
`Once a piece was moved, it couldn't be taken back...!!`
`Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!`
`......The guest room was covered by a silent darkness.`
`It was pitch black, and nothing could be seen.`
` ......However, there was a light switch just off to the side of the entrance.`
`If that was pressed, the room would be lit up, and everyone would see whether or not there was a corpse on the bed.`
`".........Should I turn on the {f:5:lights}?"`
`"No, ......wait a second, please.`
` .........Battler‐san, I have a proposal."`
`"............Let me hear it."`
`"I think you already know,`
` ......but this time around, I am not after the classic sort of victory of identifying the culprit.`
` ......My enemy is not the lowly culprit killing the pieces, .........but my opponent, you yourself."`
`".........I know.`
` ......So, ......you're after a logic error."`
`"Heheh......"`
`"......I'm seriously regretting it now.`
` ......You were acting so miserable that I fell for it completely, ......and I gave you a ridiculous privilege."`
`".........It was your {f:5:arrogance}.`
` ......It will cost you {f:5:dearly}."`
`"..................Damn......it......"`
`"......So, ...what is your proposal?"`
`With a firm voice, Beato urged her to continue.`
`{n}Until just a second ago, she had remained behind Battler's back, a bit flustered.`
`......However, she was steady now.`
`......She saw that Battler had let his emotions take control and had been lured into making a bad move...`
`...and realized that it was time for her to stay cool and support him.`
`Erika's proposal couldn't be anything good.`
`{n}And on top of that, Erika was sly.`
`She probably wouldn't make a proposal that would be easily rejected...`
`"In a moment, I will turn on the light.`
` The top of the bed will be lit up, and it will be decided whether or not Battler‐san has disappeared as the letter predicted."`
`"......If he's there, great.`
` There's nothing strange at all.`
` The letter's prediction would just be wrong.`
` ......Of course, the argument would probably switch over to "then who put the letter there?",`
` but for the time being, the location of the fight would move outside this locked room."`
`"........................And...if he's missing...?"`
`Beato already knew.`
`{n}She knew the move that Battler had made a second ago.`
`......Battler had......already disappeared from this room......`
`Therefore, they would need to prepare a different disappearing trick,`
` one other than "he was actually alive and left through the door".`
`The situation is simple.`
`First, this room is a locked room.`
`{n}Also, Battler's life or death status has not been confirmed.`
`In other words, it would pose no problem if he was alive.`
`Under these conditions, they had to make Erika think that Battler disappeared.`
`He could escape from the room,`
` ......or if that's impossible, he could hide somehow and wait for her to leave, making her think that he disappeared.`
`"Inside this tiny room,`
` ......I will begin our endgame,`
` ......the chase after the king.`
` It will be over in just a few moves.`
` You'll be unable to construct the logic needed to allow Battler to escape from this room,`
` .........and the tale will be destroyed—game over."`
`".........Fighting to keep that from happening is our job.`
` ......What is this proposal of yours?"`
`"An endgame fought over a logic error should be a bit more precise.`
` ......Once again, we will fight with the red and blue truths,`
` but we need a judge on the same level as the Game Master to observe and see that he doesn't create any logic errors with the red truth."`
`"......Th‐that seems reasonable."`
`"There's nothing special about this.`
` ......Back when the old you was the Game Master,`
` you were under the observation of your guardian, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` She judged all your red truths to be valid."`
`".........So, you're telling us to show {f:5:Lambdadelta} our cards?"`
`"I've been looking at them since the beginning.`
` ......It's okay, don't worry.`
` I'm impartial in my judgments."`
`"C‐can you say that with the red truth...?"`
`"Yep.`
` {p:1:I swear that I am impartial in my judgments}.`
` .........I was very impartial in the last game, wasn't I?"`
`"......That goes double for trials where things will be interesting either way, doesn't it?`
` .........Accept her challenge, Battler.`
` Erika is going to corner you.`
` Understand?`
` .........She will duel with you and kill you in this room.`
` ......If you're a man, accept the duel......!"`
`"S‐......sure, fine.`
` .........We won't get anywhere if every single impossible murder I present is accused of being a logic error.`
` ......It's true that we need an impartial observer to guarantee that the game is legitimate."`
`"Then I'll come around to your side.`
` ......Let me take a look at your hand.`
` ...............Hmmmmm......?"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} understood what Battler had up his sleeve.`
`......And she confirmed that Erika's first move had indeed gone straight through his heart.`
`Just as Erika had guessed,`
` Battler was alive, and after Erika had examined his "corpse", he had slipped out of the room,`
` ......placed the letter by the guesthouse, and hid himself somewhere.`
`Once the duct tape seals were retroactively placed on the guest room,`
` ......he suddenly became required to show that they had been torn.`
`However, if he had done that, it would have been the same as admitting that he had been seen through and that he had lost.`
`Unwilling to admit that, Battler had claimed that the seals had been preserved, with false courage,`
` and was now rushing to revise his logic.`
`True, he could still escape for a few more moves.`
`......However, Erika was planning to corner and kill him here...`
`"......Battler.`
` ......You're fighting with some pretty incredible cards here."`
`"Cards...?`
` ......Does this game of chess look like a card game to you?"`
`"......To me, it's always looked like you were playing a game of poker.`
` So, by moving to this side and looking at the cards you hold, I understand everything."`
`"...............This is an awful hand.`
` It's basically the lowest‐ranking hand there is...`
` And Erika knows that's exactly what you have."`
`"............Heheh...`
` What would you do?"`
`"I'm the judge. I can't give you advice.`
` ......But let me tell you my impressions."`
`"No, that's okay."`
`"......This hand gives me the tingles.`
` ......You're...intending to use this "nothing" hand...`
`...and a big wager...`
`...to bluff Erika into folding, aren't you...?`
` ......She's not going to fold, you know.`
` ......If anyone should be surrendering their chips and folding now,`
` ......it's you..."`
`"......Thanks for the advice.`
` .........Battler‐san.`
` I agree with her.`
` ......Let's back down from the fight in this room.`
` We don't have any winning cards..."`
`"Are you hoping for a card change to turn this hand into something half decent...?`
` ......But you're playing chess, aren't you...?`
` In the world of chess, ......if you rely on luck, ......you die......"`
`By "hoping for a card change",`
` .........she meant relying on luck and hoping that, even though he couldn't think of anything now,`
` he might later be able to think of a good plan for how to make this locked‐room trick hold up.`
`Battler, if you start this battle...`
`...without a trick up your sleeve,`
` .........you're marching to your death...!`
`If you ever plan to back down, it has to be now.`
`When Erika presses the light switch,`
` ......you just have to be lying on the bed.`
`......That's......all there is to it!`
`"......Lambda.`
` I don't know what you're talking about, but you're chatting too much.`
` A judge needs to be impartial."`
`"True......`
` ......Then, good luck, Battler.`
` ......I'm hoping for a precise, chess‐like battle.`
` ......You aren't......playing poker, remember......"`
`"Are you ready, Battler‐san?"`
`"Yeah, I am......`
` ......Turn the lights on whenever you want."`
`"For the rest of the fight in this room, the progression of time will be stopped.`
` This way, all the moves for both players will be made at the same time,`
` and the first move made will be treated no differently than the last move.`
` ......It might be difficult to understand what I mean, but this is a rule to protect the logic,`
` and it will protect you as well."`
`"......From here on out, you will be rebuilding the trick in this room using all the twisted logic you want.`
` ......And that means it's possible that you might think of a good idea partway through the fight."`
`".........Normally, it's unfair to revise your plot partway through.`
` In order for that to be acceptable, ......you need a world where logic thought up "after the fact" does not come "too late"—`
`a world stopped in time, where everything happens at once."`
`"Of course, Erika can take advantage of this rule as well.`
` ......If you revise your trick to be a new one, she can deal with that in a different way."`
`".........This is pretty complicated..."`
`"It's simple.`
` ......It's like a corrupt politician's war of twisted logic.`
` ......You lie shamelessly.`
` When evidence is shown revealing your lie, you retract it,`
` say that you just remembered wrong, then change to a new lie that doesn't have any contradictions."`
`"......The fight goes between a lie, then evidence exposing it, then another lie,`
` ......like a fight between two snakes spinning around trying to eat each other's tails."`
`"<Good>!`
` ......Just think of it as a world in which you're allowed to use twisted logic based off of your opponents moves as often as you want.`
` ......I used that myself when sealing this room.`
` So, I thought it was only fair to let you do the same."`
`".........You have no shame, do you...?"`
`"OK!!`
` Then, both players, begin!`
` Erika goes first, right?`
` No, maybe we start by checking the bed—see what Battler's staking on this?!"`
`"Yeah, let's start by checking the {i:bed} for Battler.`
` ......Erika, begin."`
`"Leave it to me, my master!`
` <Light>...<on>!"`
`With a click,`
` ......the sound of the light switch rang out,`
` ......and the bulb turned on, lighting up the room.`
`......Battler's bet...`
`...on the bed...`
`...was......`
`".........Dlanor.`
` Confirm it with the red."`
`"{f:5:Yes}.`
` ......Ushiromiya Battler—"`
`"No, it's my move.`
` ......I'll say it.`
` ...............{p:1:Ushiromiya Battler is not on the bed}."`
`"<Good>.`
` .........You did well not to run away from the fight.`
` I'm impressed."`
`"......It's a high‐stakes battle, so it'll cost you a lot if you're the one who loses.`
` I hope you're ready..."`
`"*giggle* No one would raise the stakes unless they felt confident in their advantage."`
`"......Dlanor.`
` Keep a record."`
`"As you {f:5:wish}."`
`At Dlanor's nod, Cornelia, who was hanging back, started taking a record.`
`She wrote down that Battler's corpse, which should have been on the bed, was not,`
` ......and also that Battler hadn't backed down from this locked‐room game...`
`"As previously announced, Battler's first move is to have the corpse vanish.`
` ......Now it's Erika's turn.`
` Go ahead."`
`"......I present the possibility that Ushiromiya Battler is alive and hiding somewhere in this room.`
` I proclaim this with the blue truth."`
`"Invalid.`
` If you want to use the blue truth, give me a specific location."`
`"......Pfft.`
` ......In the last game, Beato did that in Kinzo's study,`
` and Dlanor made Swiss cheese of her, right...?`
` I guess this is revenge...*giggle*..."`
`"Before I start searching, I have one blue truth I can use without a search.`
` {p:2:There is a possibility of a hidden door X that is impossible to discover.`
` He's hidden behind that, so it is impossible for me to find him}."`
`"{p:1:Knox's 3rd:`
` It is forbidden for hidden passages to exist}.`
` ......That right?"`
`"......`
`{p:1:No hidden places that are impossible for Erika‐san to find exist inside the guest room}."`
`"Knox's 3rd, ......{f:5:valid}."`
`"<Good>.`
` ......Then let's get started with the search."`
`......Erika slowly began to walk around the room......`
`Until the endgame had started, Erika had been energetic,`
` jumping about impatiently like a hungry dog.`
`However,`
` ......now that it had actually begun...`
`......this was a stifling battle of wits...`
`.........where each breath made her tense...`
`Even the quiet sound of the rain......was distracting......`
`"Now that I've searched the room, I request a description of its layout."`
`"......The guest room is divided into two rooms, the bedroom and the {f:5:bathroom}.`
` Currently, you have searched the entire bedroom {f:5:section}.`
` There is only one {f:5:exception}."`
`"............I'll leave that one place be for the time being.`
` So, were there any irregularities discovered in the bedroom?"`
`"There were {f:5:none}.`
` {p:1:Except for one location, there is no one to be seen in the {f:5:bedroom}}."`
`"......What's this "except for one location" business?`
` Stop being annoying and make it public."`
`"There's a reason a face‐down card remains face down.`
` ......I'll turn it over if it's needed, so look forward to it. ......*giggle*."`
`After thoroughly checking the bedroom, ......Erika headed for the bathroom door.`
`Since he wasn't in the bedroom, it was natural to think that he was in the bathroom.`
`And, since the guest room was made up of two rooms, if Battler wasn't in the bathroom either,`
` ......it would mean that he had managed to vanish from the locked room.`
`.........Except for that single location which Erika had intentionally left unchecked......`
`"I'm checking the bathroom."`
`"......Lady {f:5:Erika}.`
` ......The sound of water can be heard from {f:5:inside}.`
` Also, there is a faint {f:5:heat}."`
`"Ooh......?`
` ......Don't tell me he's taking a shower...`
` Is it locked or anything...?"`
`"No, it isn't locked.`
` Go ahead and open it."`
`"......Then, if you'll excuse me."`
`Slowly, ......Erika put her hand on the doorknob on the bathroom door......`
`......She tried to push it open, but felt a strange resistance.`
`Of course, it wasn't the resistance of the lock.`
`......It felt......as though it had an unnatural load on it......`
`Out from the slightly open crack poured the hot air from the shower.`
`However, it was unlocked, so there probably wasn't anyone taking a shower.`
`After letting a dumbfounded expression rise to her face, Erika slammed into the door with her whole body, knocking it open...`
`"Hyaa?!`
` Wh‐...what?!?!"`
`As soon as she opened the door, a tempest of hot air and water blasted her.`
`Erika was thrown for a loop, unable to understand what had happened.`
`After falling backwards on her butt, she realized that boiling hot shower water was spewing out at her, and hard.`
`"Wh‐`
`......what is this......?`
` ......What a screwed up.........prank......"`
`Cursing, Erika wrapped the blanket from the bed around herself, and tried to enter the bathroom once more.`
`This time, she was able to figure out what was going on.`
`It was......an elaborate prank.`
`A wire fixed the shower nozzle in place so that it pointed at the entrance.`
`The pressure and heat were turned up to the max,`
` so that anyone who went through the door would be met with a wave of hot water.`
`The pressure was very strong, which probably accounted for the weight she had felt when trying to push the door open.`
`She tried to make the nozzle point in another direction,`
` but not only was it fixed in place by the wire,`
` it was also fixed in a place high enough that Erika couldn't reach it with her height.`
`She tried to turn off the pressure, but that was also held in place by wires.`
`She couldn't manage anything with her bare hands.`
` She would have to get a tool that could cut the wires.`
`However, when she glanced into the bathtub, which was filled to the brim with very hot water,`
` she saw a bundle of wires and a pair of nippers that had been used to cut them lying at the bottom.`
`If she used those, she could turn off the pressure...`
`"......Ah, owowowowowowow!!`
` ......Damn you...!!"`
`The blanket she had used to protect herself from the shower became more and more drenched with boiling hot water.`
`{n}At this rate, she'd get burns even through the blanket.`
`She needed to turn the water off quickly...!`
`Looking next to the bathtub, she spotted a long‐handled body brush hanging there.`
`......Perfect...!`
`Erika used that to skillfully scoop the nippers up off the bottom of the tub.`
`Fortunately, it was a shallow Western‐style bathtub.`
`If it had been a deep Japanese one, it would probably have burned her badly.`
`Making sure not to touch the hot metal parts, she carefully took the nippers...`
`...and cut the wires around the faucet...`
`......Take that, ......and that......!`
`"Haah, ...haah!`
` Haah......haah!!"`
`She finally closed the faucet and the heat from the hot water storm died down.`
`......For a while, Erika was forced to cool her almost burnt arms under running water...`
`"......What a {f:5:calamity}."`
`"Would you like a bath?`
` I can wash your face with this brush."`
`"Allow me to {f:5:pass}."`
`"Oh. ......That's a {f:5:shame}."`
`Erika had finally regained enough of her composure to be abusive......`
`She closed the faucet completely, ......and silence returned to the bathroom.`
`After that, all that remained was Erika's heavy breathing.`
`She turned on the fan to get rid of the hot steam.`
`She left the bathroom for a moment until that was finished.`
`......It was pleasant, like stepping into an air‐conditioned room on a hot summer's day.`
`".........Now that was a ridiculous trap.`
` ...However, that wasn't here at the time I examined Battler's "corpse".`
` Therefore, the appearance of this trap proves that Ushiromiya Battler was alive.`
` ......Well, I never thought he was dead anyway."`
`"......He merely decided to openly reveal a card that had already been {f:5:exposed}."`
`"Let's check the inside of the bathroom.`
` Was Battler seen?"`
`"{f:5:No}.`
` {p:1:No one was seen in the {f:5:bathroom}}."`
`"<Good>.`
` With this, we...`
`{p:1:have confirmed that except for one location, Battler does not exist in any place inside the guest room}."`
`"......Give that a rest.`
` Just where is this one exception?"`
`"A coffin.`
` .........Ushiromiya Battler's coffin, that is."`
`"......Ashes to ashes, the dead to their {f:5:coffins}."`
`".........This room is where you plan to finish me off, right?`
` ......Fine.`
` Let's have it."`
`The previous period of silence, complete except for the rain, .........was suddenly replaced by the overpowering smell of a burning fuse.`
`Though it was extremely quiet,`
` ......the room was filled with tension......as though you could be sliced in half if you relaxed for an instant.`
`A cloud of gold butterflies gathered on the room's round table......and turned into a witch's chess board.`
`It was finally.........time for the siege.`
`"Blue truth.`
` {p:2:You did not vanish from this room.`
` You just hid yourself to make it seem as though you'd disappeared from a locked room.`
` The place you are hiding......is the "one exception" that I haven't investigated yet}."`
`As Erika lightly raised her right hand, ......`
`a single gold butterfly appeared from the darkness behind her,`
` ......flitted between the index finger and middle finger of Erika's raised hand, and became a white piece.`
`Then, .........she lifted it high into the air......`
`"{p:2:This is the one exception.`
` ......The walk‐in closet next to the entrance}!!"`
`Bang!!`
`.........Like a white bolt of lightning striking the earth,`
` ......the white piece...`
`...homed in on a weak spot in Battler's territory,`
` ......and slammed onto the board......!`
`"Yes, it is {f:5:here}...!!!"`
`With a crash, the door of the closet, which was just off to the side of the guest room's entrance, was impaled by a spear that represented the blue truth.`
` Dlanor had spun around and thrown it.`
`The door was completely pierced,`
` ......and the spear stuck in so deeply that if a human had been hiding in it, it would have struck through their chest as well.`
` ......Its still quivering handle was a testament to the force with which it had been thrown.`
`"......................................."`
`"{p:2:There are no places in which to hide other than {f:5:this}.`
` You are currently hiding in {f:5:here}}."`
`".........What do you say, Battler‐san...?`
` Have you been struck through the heart in a single blow,`
` for a literal smothered mate...?"`
`"................................."`
`"......Battler‐san.`
` ......It's our move now."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......I thought it would be like that, Erika.`
` You intentionally left one spot open so you could stuff me into that coffin.`
` ......It's the same move that trapped Kinzo in Natsuhi's room last game.`
` ......I saw this move coming."`
`"Oh, ......did you?`
` ......Then let's see your response.`
` ......But let me make a prediction."`
`"Let's hear it."`
`"......In two more moves, I will have you checkmated.`
` That's my prediction."`
`"Then I'll make the same prediction."`
`"......I'll checkmate you in just two more moves."`
`"...............Sounds interesting."`
`"......These predictions contradict each other.`
` .........Who will be the liar, I wonder......?"`
`The air crackled and sparked.`
` ......The silence would hurt one's skin.`
`"Then go {f:5:ahead}.`
` ......It is your {f:5:turn}."`
`".........It's useless.`
` Your lowly coffin won't be able to trap Battler‐san."`
`"Here's my response."`
`Slowly,`
` ......Battler held his hand over the chess board.`
`A gold butterfly that had appeared from the darkness rested on Battler's finger and became a black piece.`
`......That black piece was the king, .........which represented Battler himself.`
`"............You assert...`
`...that "{p:2:Battler is hiding in the closet}", ......and this is my response.`
` .........Take this."`
`"{p:1:Ushiromiya Battler does not exist within the guest room.`
` ......There are no exceptions, including the closet}."`
`Like a black bolt of lightning this time,`
` ......Battler slammed his piece down on the white piece of Erika's that had cut deep behind his lines, ......smashing that piece completely.`
`As gold sprayed everywhere and a faint cloud of gold dust hung in the air,`
` Erika's piece melted beautifully into the darkness......`
`"......I see, so he hid in the closet at first,`
` ......and then slipped out of the room while Erika was occupied by the shower!"`
`"It's the same technique he used to let Kinzo escape from the study in the last game.`
` Distract the observation of the observer, and disappear into the darkness."`
`"......<Good>.`
` Of course you'd say that, of course you would.`
` ......I'd already foreseen that move."`
`Next was Erika's turn.`
`......A gold butterfly fluttered in front of Erika,`
` ......and she grabbed it right out of the air with a swipe of her hand.`
`She then lifted that hand into the air.........and raised the white piece high.`
`"Let me announce a retroactive move.`
` This occurs back in the very beginning, right after I broke the seals and entered this room.`
` ......`
`{p:1:At that time, I immediately closed the door, reset the chain, and sealed this room}."`
`"Objection.`
` {p:2:Gohda severed the chain back when the crime was first discovered.`
` Since the chain lock is not functioning, it is impossible to use it to create a seal}."`
`"Objection overruled.`
` {p:1:Erika repaired the chain lock}.`
` ......See?"`
`"......That's impossible.`
` ......How could she have repaired a brass chain?"`
`"It is possible to repair.`
` ......Have you forgotten, Beato?`
` The duct tape seals.`
` ......`
`{p:1:Erika used that duct tape to join the two cut ends of the chain together, "sealing" them.`
` In other words, the chain was repaired by the duct tape, and this room once again became a locked room locked from the inside}."`
`"O‐objection.`
` Erika‐san has already used up her duct tape seals, hasn't she...?!`
` She shouldn't be able to use them anymore...!"`
`"Objection overruled.`
` {p:1:The use of the duct tape wasn't limited by the number of strips, right?`
` It was by the number of rooms.`
` ......The only restriction was to limit it to only three rooms.`
` ......Erika chose this guest room to be one of those rooms.`
` So, Erika has the right to seal as many places as many times as she wants within this room}."`
`".........ng......gah........."`
`"......That's right.`
` ......I......gave her permission to do that."`
`"This is the price you pay for your {f:5:arrogance}.`
` .........Pity is the evil liquor that the arrogant most {f:5:prefer}."`
`"So,`
` with this retroactive move,`
` {p:1:I proclaim that the chain lock has been repaired by the duct tape seal and has regained its original functionality.`
` And, thanks to that, I locked the room upon entering it and made this guest room a locked room from the inside once more}."`
`The white piece Erika held aloft......represented the seal formed by the chain lock.`
`This move would draw out Battler's king and drag it to the guillotine!`
`"Die, Battler."`
`The piece for the chain lock was slammed down on the square of Battler's king's throat.`
`"Repetition requested.`
` "The lock created by the chain is currently intact"."`
`"....................................!"`
`Battler's face contorted.`
`{n}......Beato, who was watching from behind, grimaced even more.`
`This move......was very painful.`
`If his logic was that he had hidden in the closet until Erika passed by...`
`and then used the uproar in the bathroom to escape,`
` ......then the chain lock must have been unset.`
`In other words, he couldn't respond to this repetition request.`
`And if he didn't respond, Erika's very next move would be to use the blue truth.`
`She would say, "you hid in the closet, then used the disturbance in the bathroom to escape.`
` Since you then couldn't set the chain lock from the outside, you left it undone"...`
` And she would be right.`
`......That...would be checkmate.`
`{n}As Erika had predicted, she would strike the finishing blow on the second move.`
`.........And on top of that, she would probably use the disappearing Battler...`
`to fully explain almost all of the tricks behind the crimes that were to follow.`
`......Losing the battle over this locked room would steal a major deciding piece from Battler...`
`But what if...`
`......he {i:was} able to respond to the repetition request?`
`What if he could say "the lock created by the chain is still intact"?`
`That......would be fatal to Erika.`
`It had already been shown with the red truth that this guest room could only be made into a locked room from the inside.`
`So, ......this hopeless locked room would instead become Erika's coffin.`
`With a riddle this tough, Erika would probably be forever unable to solve the mystery of Battler's disappearance.`
`And even a single unsolved riddle would mean victory for the witch side.`
`Battler......`
`wanted to respond to this repetition request if at all possible.`
`However, ......if he responded...`
`{n}If he answered by saying that the chain was still set...`
`......he would have to abandon the logic saying that he had escaped while Erika wasn't looking.`
`Because after his escape, he wouldn't be able to set the chain lock again.`
`The new riddle would put Erika in a much more difficult situation, but it would require him to construct a different escape method.`
`Even a move such as him leaving the closet during the chaos in the bathroom and hiding in another place—say, under the bed—`
`wouldn't work because he had already proclaimed that "{p:1:Battler does not exist within the guest room}".`
`If he could construct logic that allowed him to escape from here while leaving the chain lock intact,`
` ............then Erika would be the one facing a fatal blow.`
`However, ......if he didn't have that logic.........if he failed...`
`......it would be a logic error.`
`The worst and most abominable illegal move that would instantly end the game in his defeat.`
`{n}He would have no way to recover.`
`.........For Battler, ......deciding how to respond to this repetition request...`
`...was a very advanced and difficult decision......`
`Either way, ......Erika would probably corner Battler.`
`"......In that case, .........the choice is obvious."`
`"B‐......Battler‐san.`
` ......There are already many red truths guaranteeing the locked‐room status of this guest room.`
` ......How do you plan on escaping from this...?!"`
`".........If I can just do something about the chain lock......`
` ......If I can just do that........."`
`If I can somehow deceive the chain lock,`
` ......I can make Erika have to deal with a terrible locked room!`
`It will probably finish her off.`
`But in order to do that, I need to make a trick for escaping this room,`
` which remained sealed until Erika returned to it,`
` and which was sealed by a chain immediately after Erika entered—`
`and on top of that, I have to make sure that the chain that can only be set from the inside remains in place...!`
`If I can do that...if I can figure out a way...`
`...then it all ends here...!`
`But I still can't think of that trick...!`
`Right now, Erika is asking me to repeat whether the chain lock is still set or not.`
`I need to decide whether I'll take that challenge or back down...and I need to do it right now...!`
`If I have a certain‐win trick, then this is where I should fight...!`
`But if I don't have that trick,`
` ......I should just acknowledge that I slipped out of the closet, undid the chain, and escaped...and back out of the fight......`
`If I say the chain was set without a trick up my sleeve,`
` .........then it's impossible for me to escape.`
` In other words, it's a logic error......!!`
`"Even if we lose the fight in this room, there will still be chances left to us.`
` We've still only started the second day, haven't we?`
` We have plenty of time to construct another impossible murder."`
`"......No, that's no good.`
` If I admit that I fled from the room, it's the same as admitting that I'm the culprit!`
` ......If I back down from the fight in this room, ......it's the same as accepting my defeat in this game."`
`Battler's point was a valid one.`
`If Battler was the only one alive and free to move while all of the other humans were locked in the guesthouse...`
` ......Erika would probably name Battler as the perpetrator for all of the following impossible crimes and base her blue truths around that.`
`If Battler wanted to forcefully turn that around on her,`
` he would have to rewrite his tricks and logic so that "someone other than Battler" would be set up as the perpetrator.`
`To fix up one flaw, he would have to create new flaws,`
` ......and the flaws might eventually pile up and kill Battler.`
`Even running away would mean tightening the noose around his own throat.`
`The first truth...that Battler is the culprit...has already been hit upon!`
`But I'm still going to stubbornly refuse to give in......and somehow......fight to get out of this......! ...I need to fight...!!`
`This is the make‐or‐break moment.`
` I've definitely been cornered into a dangerous spot.`
`However, ......if I can nimbly switch gears, everything might turn around at once...`
`If I can just make this chain my weapon......`
`I can kill Erika...!!`
`"Wait, ......are you actually going to respond to her repetition request...?!`
` Do you have any logic for how you can escape without undoing the chain lock?!`
` .........No, you don't!`
` If you respond, that's it...! ......You'll lose instantly from a logic error!`
` It's clear which choice you ought to make!"`
`"Yeah, it's clear.`
` .........No matter what move I choose, it'll turn for the worst just as Erika wants.`
` ......If it's horrible either way,`
` ............I'd like to choose the move that has the biggest reward if we win......!"`
`".........You're going to call, even though you have no logic for escaping and no trump cards?`
` ......You're planning on accepting her repetition request and taking her on...?!"`
`"I might not have so much as a single pair in my hand.`
` ......But......with just one more card, this hand might become a straight, a flush,`
` ......or even a royal straight flush.`
` .........If hell waits for me after both options,`
` .........I'll take the one that'll finish her off if I win...!"`
`"Th‐......that's an insane move.`
` ......Sometimes, when madmen jump into the path of death,`
` .........a miracle will occur......"`
`"It's impossible!!`
` H‐......how are you going to escape this locked room without removing the chain?!!"`
`"......There's only one difference between heroes and madmen.`
` ......It's whether they win or lose.`
` .........If you're going to bet big, ......I'll be watching with interest......"`
`If I can finish things with this move, ............then as I predicted,`
` ......I can kill Erika on my second move.`
`I still can't think of a trick for escaping this locked room.`
`However, ......there has to be something......there has to......`
`And once I think of it, ......I can make a magic illusion of me changing into a butterfly...`
`and slipping like smoke out of the crack in the chain‐locked door...`
`......If I have even a drop of that mad mage's blood in my veins,`
` .........if I can have just a shred of the glorious miracle he was able to bring about,`
` ......share it with me now......!`
`"......So, Battler‐san?`
` Let's have that second move that you predicted you would checkmate me on."`
`"Please provide your answer to Lady {f:5:Erika}'s repetition {f:5:request}.`
` ......Will you {f:5:respond}, ......or will you {f:5:decline}...?!"`
`Slowly......`
`...Battler's hand.........stretched out to his king piece on the board.`
`He......lifted it up...`
`...and slowly...`
`......held it aloft...`
`...tracing a large circle in the sky......`
`Would Battler respond......or wouldn't he?`
`{n}Would the lock caused by the chain be preserved, or wouldn't it?`
`Would Battler's king.........crush the piece of the chain lock that stood right in front of it...?`
`......Or would it slip away like a ghost......and escape......?`
`"This is.........my response.`
` ............As predicted, ......on my second turn...`
`......you're through.`
` .........Here it comes,`
` ......Furudo...`
`...Erikaaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa!!!"`
`Battler's king became a black lightning bolt and crashed down onto the board...`
`Where had it gone?!`
`On top of the piece of the chain lock?`
`{n}Or past that piece...?`
`".........I will respond to the repetition request.`
` {p:1:The lock caused by the chain is intact}."`
`Battler's king...`
`......had left the chain lock piece in its place...`
`......and had...`
`...{i:slipped past it}......`
`"Heh, ......heheheheheheheh......`
` ......Yes, it sure would be cool if you could say that the chain lock was still set, wouldn't it......?`
` That certainly would be cool, I admit......`
` ......But do you know what they call someone who's so full of himself...`
`that he jumps into the path of death just because it's cool......?"`
`"............No clue......"`
`"Ushiromiya...Battler.`
` ...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
`...`
` That's`
` what`
` we`
` call`
` him,`
` foo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oool!`
` I file a motion for a logic error!!"`
`"With that last red truth, you have just cut off your own logic!!`
` May the impartial judge issue a judgment on this matter immediately, please!!`
` Great Lady {f:5:Lambdadeltaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa}!!!"`
`"Motion received.`
` ......{f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` Does this make logical sense? Your inspection, please."`
`"Motion received.`
` ............Battler.`
` .........Show me.`
` Let me see......your cards........."`
`".........Battler......san............"`
`"......It is a royal...`
`straight flush, right......?`
` If you've got nothing,`
` ......you won't get out of this with just a "sorry", okay......?"`
`".....................`
` ......Yeah.`
` I have no intention of apologizing."`
`"......If it's a logic error, the game board will be blown away.`
` ......You inherited this game board from Beato.`
` .........It's the one memento you possess...`
`of your precious Beato.`
` So you'll never be able to accept a logic error."`
`A logic error only becomes established when the witch admits to it.`
`As long as they keep thinking about new logic by which they could escape, ......they will not die, cannot die.`
`However, ......that is like being imprisoned in an endless living hell of the mind.`
`"......Even if you do manage to crawl around forever after falling into the darkness of thought,`
` ......you'll just be eternally trapped in a hell where you constantly think of ways to escape the locked room while denying the logic error."`
`"......Are you sure?! Are you sure?!`
` This is the next worst thing to the depths of oblivion, you know?!?!`
` It's like the difference between falling from the roof of a ten‐story building and falling from the roof of a hundred‐story building!!"`
`"............Lambda.`
` Battler has already finished making his move.`
` Players can't take back a move once it's made.`
` ......Act as the impartial judge you swore to be, carry out our motion,`
` and see whether or not Battler's escape from the locked room is logical...and whether there has been a logic error or not."`
`"Be slow, accurate, and meticulous like an archaeologist.`
` ......And, be as fast as a guy at an ice cream shop when he forcefully and skillfully scoops out that sweet, fragrant vanilla/soy sauce ice cream!!!"`
`"Y‐...yes, I know that.`
` .........Battler,`
` .........I'm taking a look now."`
`".....................Battler‐san......"`
`"Beato, ......do you think......I'll lose?"`
`"......I don't want to think that.`
` ......You fought with the old me many times...`
`...and finally reached the miracle that I so wanted you to find.`
` ......So, ......I'd like to believe.........that you'll accomplish a miracle...`
`......once again...!"`
`".........The woman called {f:5:Beatrice}...`
` ...She fought on that same border between reason and madness...`
`......the whole time.`
` ......She fought with a mixture of anger, sadness, and several other emotions towards me that can't be described with words.`
` .........And in the very last game,`
` ......at the very last moment,`
` .........she managed...`
`......to seize victory."`
`That might have been......the rank of the hand in Beato's grip as she fell.`
`Beato passed away...`
`...without realizing...`
`...that she had already won.`
`In that final game,`
` ......the true victor.........`
`was Beato......`
`"She entrusted me with this game board.`
` ......That's why...I'm going to win.`
` .........So, I need you alone to believe in me.`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice}..."`
`"If believing......will bring about a miracle..."`
`"........................Please."`
`"I'll believe in you......!!`
` Battler‐san...!!!"`
`"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh, this is pissing me ooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooff!!!`
` Please just check it already, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}!!`
` There {i:is} no valid logic!`
` There doesn't exist any way to get out of this locked room!!`
` You were overeager, Battler‐san!`
` Sure, if you could win with this, that'd be cool!"`
`"If you managed to disappear even though the chain was still set, that'd be amaaaazing! So cooool! How mysterious! Hold me!`

` Like hell you caa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaan!!`
` Like {i:hell} you can do that!!`
` If you could do that, you really would be a witch!`
` If you could vanish your way out of this locked room like a puff of smoke, I'd have to acknowledge it!`
` It'd be the work of a wii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iitch!!!"`
`"Quiet, Lady {f:5:Erika}!`
` ......Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} is conducting her {f:5:inspection}."`
`".................................`
` ...............Pass through, one move.`
` ...Go back,`
` ......corner."`
`With sweat gathering on her forehead, ......{f:5:Lambdadelta} inspected the movements of the pieces from Battler's side.`
`She was as accurate and meticulous as an archaeologist, ......just as {f:5:Bernkastel} had told her to be.`
`"................................."`
`After gulping stiffly,`
` ......Lambda looked between the formation of the pieces on the board...`
`...and Battler's face,`
` which remained tense but steady.`
`"......Lambda.........?"`
`".........I have...`
`......finished my inspection......"`
`"There's no way the logic works......!"`
`"...............Please......God......"`
`"..........................."`
`".........Erika."`
`"What...?"`
`"I'm very sorry."`
`"Wh‐.........which way am I supposed to take that...?!!"`
`"It was fun.`
` ......Now, this is the end."`
`"For hell's sake, ......which way am I supposed to take thaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaat?!!"`
`"Silence!!`
` I have finished inspecting Battler's move.`
` .........The verdict is—"`
`{a:c:`
`"......Valid."}`
`"Va......lid.........?"`
`"......You lie...!!"`
`"I judge it to be valid.`
` ......He's presented logic that doesn't violate any of the red truths, and I've finished checking it.`
` ......The move by the player on the witch side, and the red truth given in response to the final repetition request, is valid.`
` .........Battler.`
` For the first time, ......I have to say I think you're incredible..."`
`".........See?`
` ......In your game, ......a miracle will always occur if you believe."`
`"B‐.........Battler...san......!!`
` I...I'm sorry...!!`
` If only I had believed more strongly, ......you wouldn't have been cornered like this......!! Waaaaaaaahh!!"`
`Beato flew onto Battler's chest, sobbing...`
`Erika staggered backwards, ......shaking her head back and forth dizzily.`
`And {f:5:Bernkastel}...?`
`............Her face was like an expressionless mask.`
`Then, ......slowly...`
`......it became a smile...`
`And for some reason,`
` ......it seemed the sign of some horrible emotion......`
`"Well......{f:5:done}......`
` ......To think...`
`...that you escaped the room...`
`...without removing the chain...`
` ......Simply {f:5:splendid}......"`
`With her small hands, .........Dlanor slowly started to applaud quietly.`
`......She was followed by Gertrude, and then Cornelia.`
`......And then by Beato and {f:5:Lambdadelta} too.`
`{n}.........Applause......filled the room.........`
`"O‐......Onii‐chan......`
` ......H‐......how did you........."`
`"......I see.`
` ......Yes, a move that cannot be seen by one whose thoughts are trapped within the locked room..."`
`"Impossible,`
` ......im...`
`...possible......`
` ......Eee...`
`eeeeeeeeeeek.........!"`
`As {f:5:Lambdadelta} watched Erika, who was stunned and moaning in shock from despair she couldn't accept,`
` ...she had to take her hat off to the strength of Battler's heart and intelligence at this critical moment...`
`...and to the power of his miracles.`
`......Incredible, ......Ushiromiya Battler.`
`I was so wrong to think that your power and Beato's would cancel each other out and bring an eternal draw...... I've suffered total defeat.`
` .........And Bern, who realized your true strength,`
` but thought she could get you to do what she wanted...`
`...well, she's suffered total defeat too.`
`Bern is the witch who waits for miracles.`
`{n}You are the witch who summons miracles.`
`.........You...`
`...are not Bern's piece.`
`......In this moment,`
` ......without a doubt,`
` ......you have surpassed Bern......`
`......The fact that you only took a moment to think up a trick to escape this locked room...`
`......really is...`
`......nothing short of stunning......!`
`As Erika predicted, ......Battler had been hiding in the closet.`
`Then, during the chaos in the bathroom, he had snuck out of the door.`
` ......Erika had guessed this much.`
`She retroactively set the chain lock and sealed it to prevent Battler from doing this very thing.`
`The chain lock cannot be reset from the outside.`
`{n}So, it should have been impossible to escape from the locked room.`
`However, ......by thinking outside of the locked room, ......Battler broke through.`
`......We can use anyone to explain it, ......but let's go with the piece of Kyrie, his mother.`
`Just like Battler,`
` the other victims of the first twilight have not been confirmed dead with the red truth.`
`In other words, ......just like Battler,`
` ......the others—including Kyrie—can still move.`
`And their locked rooms are not sealed, so they can go out as they please.`
`......Kyrie......came to save him.`
`Kyrie followed behind Erika, ......and waited in the hallway while the latter entered the guest room and sealed the door from the inside.`
`......Then, after Battler undid the chain lock and escaped,`
` .........she entered the room in his place......`
`Then, ......Kyrie reset the chain lock from the inside,`
` ......and hid in the closet, ......just like Battler had done......`
`Yes.`
` ......It is true that Battler isn't inside this guest room right now.`
`However, that doesn't mean that no one else is inside it.`
`......Kyrie took Battler's place in the closet,`
` .........the one exception that Erika left unchecked, and is there still......`
`Kyrie...`
`......saved......Battler............`
`{a:c:`
`{p:1:`
`Ushiromiya Kyrie`
` {f:5:cannot save} Battler`
`}.}`
`............Huh.........?`
`"Wh‐......what do you mean......?"`
`"......`
`{p:1:Ushiromiya Kyrie......cannot save Battler}."`
`"...Wh‐......why not?!`
` There's no red saying that Kyrie can't save Battler!`
` Wait a second, ......how are you using the red truth?!"`
`"It's valid.`
` .........Dlanor's red truth is valid."`
`"Applying for authorization to unsheathe the Red {f:5:Key}."`
`".........Granted.`
` Dlanor, do it, please."`
`"H‐............how......?`
` ......How...can {i:you} authorize that?!?!"`
`"It's valid.`
` ......I guarantee this red truth by impartial judgment."`
`".........Without telling us your reason?!"`
`"We'll reveal that soon.`
` ......Very soon."`
`"...B‐......Battler hasn't proclaimed Kyrie dead with the red truth yet...!`
` It's allowed for Kyrie to be playing dead!`
` And the duct tape has already been used on three rooms, making it impossible for you to seal Kyrie's room...!"`
`"So how can you use the red truth to say that Kyrie can't save Battler?!`
` That red truth has no basis!!"`
`"We'll tell you its basis soon.`
` ......But more importantly, Lambda......?`
` ......The logic with Kyrie has ceased to function.`
` ......You should probably find another piece to switch places with Battler, don't you think...?"`
`"...........................nn,`
` ......y‐`
`...yes.`
` ......There are still pieces that can save Battler."`
`Reconstruct the logic.`
`......All we need is someone who can switch places with Battler—it doesn't have to be Kyrie.`
`"Then let's switch it to Natsuhi.`
` ......Ushiromiya Natsuhi switched places with Battler...!"`
`"Dlanor. ......Do it."`
`"As you {f:5:wish}."`
`Dlanor's red longsword......smashed Natsuhi's piece into little bits...`
`How...?!`
`How...`
`...can Erika deny this logic...`
`...without the detective's authority?!`
`"{p:1:Ushiromiya Natsuhi cannot save Battler}."`
`"Th‐then Eva!`
` Ushiromiya Eva!!"`
`"{p:1:Ushiromiya Eva cannot save Battler}."`
`"Then Rosa!`
` Maria!!"`
`"{p:1:Save your br{f:5:eath}.`
` Neither Rosa nor Maria can come to his ai{f:5:d}.`

`{f:5:death‐death‐death‐death}!`
` <Die the DEATH>!`
` <Sentence to DEATH>!`
` <Great equalizer is the DEATH>}!!"`
`"O‐objection!`
` Erika‐san doesn't have the detective's authority!`
` ......How can she use any red except for the duct tape seals...?!"`
`"Objection overruled.`
` ......The lack of the detective's authority does not imply that no red truth can be used whatsoever.`
` ............There is a way.`
` ......Isn't there?"`
`"Yes, ......there is.`
` There are......a few exceptional red truths......that even {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s without the detective's authority can use."`
`"......That's crazy...`
` ......There's no way something like that exists!"`
`"Yes, such a thing cannot {f:5:exist}.`
` ......However, ......there is a certain action permissible only to {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s without the detective's authority,`
` ......and it can become a truth of such overwhelming credibility...`
`......that witches can easily raise it to the level of red {f:5:truth}."`
`"A certain action permissible only to {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s who...`
`...aren't the detective.........?"`
`".....................Y‐......you don't mean...`
` ......Erika......you didn't......"`
`"......I...I've got it.`
` ......Yes, ...if I'm right,`
` ......these red truths are valid..."`
`"I...I don't understand!`
` Was there some power that could only be used without the detective's authority...?!"`
`".........There is.`
` ......There is just one."`
`"So, you've finally realized.`
` ......That's right.`
` ......And it was for that reason, and that reason alone, ......that I abandoned the detective's authority this time around.`
` ......You told me I could make the detective proclamation whenever I wanted, right?`
` .........Well, unfortunately,`
` ...I am no longer capable of making that proclamation."`
`"Knox's...`
`......which one was it......"`
`"{p:1:Knox's 7th.`
` .........It is forbidden for the detective to be...`
`the {f:5:culprit}}."`
`"B‐but that's...`
`......wh‐.........whaaat?!"`
`......Finally, Beato realized everything.`
`Yes, ......the detective's authority bestows several powers that are useful for reasoning,`
` but it eliminates one single privilege.`
`That is Knox's seventh commandment.`
`{n}......It is forbidden for the detective to be the culprit...`
`"......In this game,`
` ......it is impossible for {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s without the detective's authority to examine corpses perfectly."`
`"......So, ......there have been several tricks where the dead have all been faking and walking around where they please.`
` ......You probably thought you could use that logic to create several impossible crimes after this."`
`"......When I said that I wouldn't make the detective proclamation,`
` somewhere on the inside, you must have said "I've won"."`
`".........You're pretty sly yourself.`
` You gave me the duct tape seals, seemingly out of mercy, but that was because you planned to have all of the first twilight victims survive,`
` band together, and carry out the crimes.`
` That's why you gave me only three rooms' worth, which wouldn't cover all six people."`
`"No matter which rooms I sealed, at least one of your pawns could move freely.`
` .........You must have been plotting to use that to corner me.`
` ......But too bad.`
` Your naivety is deeply tiresome.`
` ......You stupid man!"`
`"..................I admit it.`
` ......I admit that I fell for your monkey show...`
`and that in my pride, I tried to show you some mercy.`
` .........That's right.`
` ......Even without the detective's authority, ......there is a way.`
` ......A way for a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} to make sure that a corpse examination cannot fail."`
`Is the human lying in front of you alive or dead?`
`You can answer that question by examining the corpse.`
`With just a quick glance, your chances of being right are fifty‐fifty either way.`
`Various bits of knowledge and experience can be used to obtain a more precise result.`
`.........However, no matter how much you do that,`
` while you can reach up to 99%, you can never reach 100% accuracy.`
`......That's what most people would think.`
`However, there is one way.`
`{n}......One way to conduct a perfect examination.`
`"Kill them.`
` .........It's as simple as that."`
`".........Erikaa...aa......"`
`"Without the detective's authority, I can't tell whether the victims are dead or faking.`
` So, I needed a way to be sure.`
` ......And, if possible,`
` it would be preferable if they were removed from the game board,`
` so that they couldn't make a mess of things later on."`
`"So, I dashed all over the mansion,`
` visited all the crime scenes,`
` and............`
`{p:1:I killed everyone all over again}!"`
`"Wh‐......what on.........earth..............."`
`".........Of course, she couldn't just kill them however she liked.`
` ......It had to be a perfect way of killing, good enough that their deaths could be determined with the red truth.`
` ......Erika made sure of that."`
`"The manner in which they were each killed differed,`
` .........but afterwards,`
` {p:1:she completely severed the heads of all those she killed}.`
` ......That method of killing is solid enough to be called a red truth, right...? Lambda......?"`
`"......I‐...............it's valid.`
` No human could survive...`
`......after being decapitated...!"`
`"C‐could you have severed all of those heads without getting any blood on you?!"`
`"For example, you can take a large trash bag from the kitchen and grab the knife through it.`
` ......Then, if you cover the entire corpse with the trash bag as you do your work, you can block nearly all of the blood spatter."`
`Naturally, I prepared a separate knife and bag for each person I killed, and left those items at the crime scene.`
`Of course, I didn't humiliate myself by walking around with them, leaving blood in the hallways and dirtying my clothes.`
`There will probably be trash bags left at the crime scene with my fingerprints on them,`
` but since the game ends before the police come, and the bags won't be used as evidence of anything,`
` they can just be left there without a problem.`
`"......Are you insane?`
` ......What kind of...`
`mystery would...`
`ever allow something like that......?"`
`"I can't believe I'm hearing {i:that} from a witch on the fantasy side.`
` Oh, and don't worry.`
` I didn't kill you.`
` ......I found you last and didn't have time to sever your head,`
` so I just sealed your whole room with the duct tape you gave me."`
`"......Then again, that might've been because I knew this would happen and wanted to watch you flounder.`
` .........*giggle*,`
` ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!`
` Oh, that's right.`
` ......Just like I can say that I killed them in red, I can say one more thing."`
`At that point, Erika stopped for a second,`
` ......and still,`
` ...aaah, is she really capable of an expression even uglier than all the ones before......?`
`With that...`
`...greatest of all faces, ......she spoke.`
`"{p:1:All five people I killed......were very much alive until the moment I killed them}.`
` ......Everyone faithfully played dead as best they could until the moment just before I killed them, okay?"`
`".........Maria‐san was quite the little trouper.`
` .........After all, even though her mother had already been killed in the same room,`
` .........she kept on playing dead without even noticing......`
` *giggle*, {nobr:*giggle*giggle*—}"`
`"Hahahahaha,`
` ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...`
`he{0}ha{0}hyah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}haaa{0}haaaah!!"`
`They're devils...`
`Up to now,`
` ......many witches and demons have appeared in this tale,`
` ......but this is the first time...`
`...I've seen...`
`...a true devil......`
`"You bastards......`
` ......You bastards......`
` ...Uu......uugyaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!!"`
`At last, Beato understood the entire plot of this tale.`
`This tale......was just the story of a prank.`
`Someone must have come up with the idea of playing a slightly harsh trick on their inconsiderate guest,`
` who loved to show off her intelligence and act the part of a great detective,`
` ......and several people had agreed to go along with it.`
`The ones who would play the victims went into their assigned rooms, set the chain and the lock from the inside,`
` ......and played dead......to create a fake locked‐room murder......`
`......If you think about it that way, the rooms chosen for the corpses seem to make more sense.`
`It was only natural for Natsuhi to "die" in her own room.`
`......If you're going to play dead, it's only natural that you'd want to lie down on your own bed.`
`Eva's vanity is strong, so she must have volunteered to "die" in the VIP room.`
`Kyrie was in Krauss's study.`
`......That was probably well air‐conditioned and comfortable.`
`Rosa and Maria were in the parlor.`
`A soft sofa would have been a great place to play dead.`
`......Maria had gone the extra mile to make it look more realistic by lying dead alongside the wall.`
`Battler was in a guest room.`
` The temperature here was also nice.`
`{n}The bed must also have been fairly pleasant.`
`...Yes.`
` The victims for this first twilight had all died in comfortable rooms.`
`In the past games, the corpses had often been found exposed in the courtyard or under the rose garden arbor.`
`In the cold gardening shed or in the boiler room......`
`This time, there were no victims in any such inhospitable environments.`
`This...`
`...is probably the truth.`
`This was the story of a prank, where no one was dead in the first place...`
`And then...`
`......this......devil...`
`............turned it into a genuine murder case......!`
`"......You do have the right to speak ill of Lady {f:5:Erika}.`
` ......However, ......at this moment, you have the obligation to present new logic that does not lead to any {f:5:contradictions}."`
`"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.`
` Corpses to corpses...!`
` So, Battler‐san? Let's continue the game!!`
` Please present a different human to switch places with you.`
` If you don't, your trick.........will become a logic error......"`
`There's now......no one who can come to the rescue.`
`Erika's killed every last one of them!!`
`"D‐......dammit......dammit, dammit, dammii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}it!!"`
`"......Battler‐san, please, calm yourself...!`
` Now's the time to wipe our tears away and fight...!`
` Even if you've lost five pieces who can save you, there's still eleven in the guesthouse!"`
`"Y‐you're right...`
` ......Krauss, Hideyoshi, Rudolf, ......George, Jessica, Shannon, Kanon!`
` Genji, Gohda, Kumasawa, Nanjo!!`
` It doesn't matter who, as long as someone comes here!!`
` Somebody, somebody, hee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}elp!!"`
`"But there's no waa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}ayy{-}y{-}y{-}yy{0}weh{0}wehh{0}wehh{0}wweh{0}wweh{0}weehhh!!`
` Take a look at thiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiis!`
` Gertruuuude,`
` Corneliaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa!!"`
`""For your attention: we beg to inform you that we are here and ready.""`
`"Bwaattleeer‐swaaaaaann!!`
` You gotta seee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eee thiiiis!!`
` Whaaaaaat'sssss the deeeeeeal?!"`
`Erika, who was now so excited that her pronunciation was tumbling all over the place,`
` pointed at two doors.`
`It was the hallway on the second floor of the guesthouse...`
`{n}......They were in front of the cousins' room and the next room over.`
`"Look, here, here!`
` There's {i:something} stuck to the {i:doo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oor}!!`
` Whuzzis?! Whuzzis?!`
` Hey, do {i:you} know, Gertrooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ood?!"`
`"......For your attention: know that it is the duct tape seal of the cousins' room."`
`"<OH YEAAAAHHH>!!`
` <VERY GOOOOOD>!!`
` <One more>!!`
` Wuzzabout the thing on THIS doorrrr{-}r{-}r{-}r{-}r{-}r{-}rrr?!?!"`
`"Be advised that it is the duct tape seal of the next room over."`
`"<Oh, very GOOD>!!`
` Okay, you two!`
` And all of you watching at home on your TVs!!`
` Pleease have a look at the duct tape seals on both doors!!`
` So, what do you think of them...?!`
` Are they broken? Are they not broken...?`
` Please, the red truth, loudly so we all can hear!!"`
`""{p:1:For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.`
` Know that neither is broken}.""`
`"{p:1:Know that an unbroken seal is proof that all have hitherto been denied passage}."`
`"{p:1:It needs no second telling, but be advised that passing through without breaking the seal is impossible}!!"`
`"{f:5:Good}.`
` ...Battler, it is as you {f:5:see}.`
` ......There no longer exists anyone who can come to your {f:5:aid}."`
`The victims of the first twilight have all been killed!`
`{n}And the guesthouse is still sealed!!`
`No one can come to the rescue...!!`
`"Uug......`
`kh...`
`...gghh.........!"`
`Erika had anticipated this moment all that time ago,`
` ......and that was why she had made the strategic move of suddenly sealing these two rooms.`
`This resolved the confusion Cornelia had felt back then.`
`Why wouldn't the human side player want as many free humans as possible?`
` That was a natural, simple question to ask.`
`However, once you seal up {i:all} of the humans,`
` ......there is no room for magic to intervene.`
`Why is magic magic?`
`{n}Because the people who saw it say that it was magic.`
`Then, is it possible for magic to exist in a place with no people?`
`{n}......There's no problem with that because there's no anti‐magic toxin, right...?`
`Wrong!`
` Magic in a place that isn't being witnessed is no different from a delusion, a daydream!`
`Magic with results must be carried out by human hands.`
`{n}If all humans are sealed off, then magic cannot be created.`
`This was Erika's strategy for this game......and her beautiful...checkmate!!`
`"Well now.`
` ......Who's going to come save you?`
` Please tell me who the "real" person is who switched places with you, remained in the guest room in your place,`
` and set the chain lock from the inside.`
` ......If they even exist."`
`".........Well, Battler...?`
` You have a broken thread of logic.`
` ......Who could have come to save you?`
` You are currently in the middle of a logic error."`
`"Uugh...`
`......w‐`
`......wait...`
` I'm still......thinking......!"`
`"......Battler, you have two rights and one obligation.`
` ......Your first right is the right to build a new thread of logic to reconstruct your locked‐room trick.`
` Your second right is the right to come clean and admit to your logic error.`
` And your one obligation...is to choose one of those two options."`
`"There is some mercy.`
` There's no restriction on the amount of time you have to make that choice.`
` .........*giggle*, that's right, your time is endless, eternal."`
`"I...I'm sure there's still some way,`
` .........some twisted logic or loophole or...`
`...anyway, ......I'm sure there's still some way......!"`
`"I'm thinking about it!`
` What about you, Beato?!`
` ......Let me know if you find anything...`
` .........I'm sure the old Beato......could have managed something...`
` She built up several locked rooms like this...!!"`
`Beato felt awful...`
`......Why was she Beato, and yet not?!`
`Surely, the old her would have thought up a trick under these restrictions.`
`If only she could do that, she could guide Battler to victory......but she couldn't do it as her current self!`
`"*giggle*.`
` Yes, I'm sure you'll think of a good trick.`
` Eventually, surely, probably, maybe.`
` ......Pretty sure it's impossible though.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"......So then, Battler.`
` ......Let's go back to the guest room.`
` From now on, that will be your world."`
`Once again, ......they returned to the slightly chilly guest room.`
`It was the same room as before, of course,`
` ......but it felt as though an unsettling darkness had crept in...`
`"Here's the room you'll spend your days in from now on.`
` .........You just need to escape from this room by any means you want."`
`"......However, there are conditions.`
` ......As I believe you know, these are all things you forced on yourself."`
`"......First,`
` {p:1:this room is a locked room created from the inside.`
` The seals on the windows are intact, so there can be no escape from there.`
` Of course, there is no way to escape by leaving through the bathroom}."`
`"{p:1:......I'll make it simple.`
` There is no exit to escape from except for this door.`
` However, the chain lock on this door is set.`
` You can unset and reset it all you want, but you can only do so from the inside.`
` Furthermore, you are free to go out through the door, but leaving while the chain lock remains unset will not count as an escape}.`
` You have to show that you can escape from this room with the chain lock still connected......!!"`
`"......But...`
`...he couldn't possibly......"`
`"He couldn't possibly do it?`
` He made this locked room himself...!!"`
`"We have set up...just one exit other than the door.`
` ......That one's in the bathroom."`
`"My merciful master has arranged for a last way out if you fail to think of any trick to escape.`
` ......Please listen up!!"`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} guided Battler to the bathroom.`
`It was just a normal bathroom.`
`The setup intended to surprise Erika and buy Battler time was no longer working.`
`However, the bundle of wire and the nippers that had been used to prepare that trap...`
`still lay in the empty bathtub.`
`"Are you saying......that I can use these to help me escape.........?"`
`"Yes, please feel free.`
` It's a present.`
`......However, no matter what you use, you can't lock the room from the outside.`
` And you can't fool the seals either, okay?`
` These tools aren't here to help you pull some trick with the chain lock.`
` ......They're here to let you escape from this room in a more direct way..."`
`"......H‐......how am I supposed to use these......?"`
`"........................`
` ......Not bad, Bern.`
` ......I see......that your mind's as grotesque as ever........."`
`"There is an exit that leads directly outside from this bathroom.`
` ......Can you find it?"`
`"......Y‐......you don't mean............"`
`"D‐did you figure it out, Beato...?!`
` Please, tell me...!!"`
`"That's...`
`.........i‐`
`......impossible........."`
`"Please, where is it?! Tell me!!`
` We can't let the game end like this!!"`
`"There......"`
`"Huh? Where......?`
` Under...the bathtub......?"`
`"Can't you see it? There's a round hole that leads straight out of this room."`
`"......It's a bit small though......"`
`"Y‐`
`......you...`
`......you...`
`......aahh...`
`...nngggyaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh......"`
`"It's the drain right there at the bottom of the bathtub.`
` You can get out through there without touching the chain lock.`
` But your body is a bit too big to get through this exit.`
` ......That's why I decided to lend you those tools there."`
`Escape......through the drain...?`
` How...?`
`She couldn't mean using those nippers for a hundred years to widen that hole, right...?`
`Battler and Beato......had already realized.`
`......They had figured out this demonic way out that the demons were proposing......`
`"Just use those nippers...`
`...and cut your body into pieces that can fit."`
`"......Pinch, rip, snip.`
` ......You can sit back in the tub under a hot shower...`
`...and start from your toes...snip then wash, snip then wash...`
` Just keep doing that and, oh, what do you know,`
` you've suddenly managed to escape from the locked room."`
`"‘Oh, what do you know’ is right, my master...!`
` It looks like both siblings are going to end up the same way...!`
` Heheh......heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eeh{0}eh{0}eheh!!"`
`"But Bern...?`
` If he does it that way, the hand holding the nippers will be left at the end."`
`"That's why we have the wire...`
` ...Beforehand, Battler will have to wrap the wire around his wrist, then stretch the other end out into the corridor through the crack in the door.`
` ......You should be able to fit just a wrist through the crack left by the chain lock."`
`"......If you can make yourself that small, I'd be happy to pull that wire from the hallway and save you."`
`"My master, if you do that, I want it!!`
` Battler's wrist...`
`eheheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eeh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh!!"`
`"And what would you use that for...?`
` But no, I've already decided to use it as a back scratcher.`
` When the time comes, I'll scratch your back with it. What do you say?"`
`"Y‐yeees, my master...`
` ...Master's going to scratch my back...`
`with Battler's handhaha{0}ha{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aha{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!"`
`"........Finding them annoying?`
` Irritating? Obnoxious?`
` ......Don't worry, it'll get quiet really soon.`
` ......Until you can escape from this room, all noise to disturb your thoughts...`
`......will disappear for all eternity."`
`"Th‐...that's a relief...`
` I'll be glad of the quiet...!"`
`"..................Here's......some advice from a survivor of hell.`
` ......Enjoy the liveliness while you can.`
` .........Even the annoying insults you hear now...`
`......will be useful as fond memories to preserve your sanity in the depths of eternal silence."`
`.........Do you hate Bern and Erika?`
`Then that's their parting gift to you.`
`.........As long as you have hatred, you will be able to avoid giving up.`
`Giving up has a completely different meaning here, okay...?`
`.........Once you give up, {i:still} can't escape, and realize that hell is eternal,`
` ......you'll wish you prepared yourself earlier.`
`"Did you just call yourself a survivor......?`
` ......Then,`
` .........you also......"`
`"......You know, ............every once in a while,`
` ...that terror comes back to me.`
` .........I wonder......whether I really have escaped from that hell.`
` .........What if......I actually lost my mind a long time ago...`
`......and I'm still in there...`
`......just having delusions about being here and chatting happily with you all like this...?`
` .........That nightmare still terrifies me..."`
`".........And so, I need to constantly feel...truly feel that this isn't a dream...`
` ......Hey, ......are you guys......really.........real......?`
` ...You aren't just an insane delusion I'm having inside that hell, ......right......? Right? .........Right......?"`
`There was something in {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s pleading expression that sent shivers down the spine.`
`It was probably more terrifying than any threatening words she could have used with even the most vile expression on her face......`
`It was time for Battler to realize.`
`......A logic error isn't so sympathetic that you can just stick out your tongue,`
` ask for forgiveness, and say you'll be more careful next time......`
`Even if you feel that the fight is at a point where you can't back down, risking a logic error by leaving things up to chance......is {i:never}......a risk you should take.`
`It was time for him to pay up and understand the true risk and terror implied by the words "betting one's life on a fight",`
` which must sound so exciting for a man......`
`"Battler‐san, hang on in there...!`
` I'll think deeply upon it as well!`
` I'll devote everything I have to thinking of a trick to escape this room...!`
` I will come to save you...!!"`
`"B‐......Beato......`
` ...Uuu......uuua{0}a{0}a{0}arrg{0}g{0}g{0}g{0}ghhhh......`
` I'll definitely think of something... Just you waaaaaaatch......"`
`"Well, regretfully, it's time for us to leave.`
` We mustn't get in the way of his job any longer."`
`"See you later,`
` Battler‐san.`
` ......Or, like you'd say it, <see you again>, right?`
` <Have a nice day>...`
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`".........Later,`
` ......Battler.`
` ......Good luck."`
`"Battler‐san, don't give up...!`
` You'll definitely think of a trick!`
` I'll think as well, and I'll come to save you!!"`
`"B‐......Beato............?!"`
`Before he could finish saying Beato's name, ......they had all disappeared.`
`{n}......They hadn't disappeared in a golden spray, or turned into butterflies and flown away...`
`As if there had never been anyone but him in this room to begin with,`
` ......Battler blinked once,`
` .........and everyone else was gone.`
`Nothing remained—`
`not their voices, their presence, their warmth,`
` ......nor even the faint perfume Beato had worn.`
`The frigid air of the room was wrapped only in the lonely sound of the wind and rain......`
`With that overpowering feeling of isolation......`
`I finally began to realize.........how horrible a punishment......this would be......`
`"D‐......damn those bastards...`
` ......It can't be that hard to get out of a room like this......`
` I mean, rooms are made so that people can come in and out of them, right...?`
` ......If they can't do that, you wouldn't call it a room."`
`This is stupid...`
` ......It's easy to undo a lock and chain from the inside.`
`......Dammit...`
` ......For some reason, I've always been clumsy,`
` ......and undoing chain locks always gives me trouble.`
`Aha, ......it's off.`
` Heheh, ......heh......what a stupid puzzle.`
`{n}Look, ......now the door opens freely, ......see...`
`......Hey...`
`...what's this cold feeling on my neck......?`
`What the hell is this.........?`
`......Why is there suddenly this iron collar around my neck......that's attached to a chain?`
`Dammit, who would do something like that...`
`......Wh‐when I reset the chain lock, it disappears.`
` And when I undo it, it comes back.`
`The chain is pretty long, so I can make it a little way out into the hallway.`
`{n}But I can't go far from the door...`
`Then if I close the door,`
` .........stand on the outside and stick my hand through the crack...`
`......and just somehow set that chain......`
` .........Uuu......geh......`
`Why......have I always been so clumsy...`
` .........I'm not really clumsy, ......it's just that me and chain locks don't go well together...`
` Dammit, ......I hate chain locks, ...I hate chains......`
` Why......won't it work......?`
` Why......can't I set the chain lock from the outside......?`
` Dammit...dammit...dammit...`
` ......Nng...`
`...ggyaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhh...!!!`
`"......Battler‐san,`
` ......Battler‐san!!`
` Hang in there, hang in there...!!"`
`"...........................`
` ......Can't......get out...`
`.........ggh......kk........."`
`Beato called out to Battler repeatedly, shaking his shoulders hard, ......but by now, Battler's eyes were blank.`
`......The words didn't reach him......`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} and Erika had already left.`
`The game was officially suspended until Battler could think of a new trick,`
` ......but it was doubtful that it would be resumed even after a thousand years...or more...`
`".........Okay, I'm heading off too.`
` ......So long, you two."`
`"Th‐there's no need to say "so long"...!`
` We'll—We'll think of a trick in no time, and the game will resume!`
` We won't take up your time...!`
` So stay here a little longer...! Please...!!"`
`"......We've drawn those same words out of many a witch's mouth in the past.`
` ......And I've heard of hardly any who've actually managed to resume their games.`
` ......As far as I know, the only two are me......and Bern."`
`"Why......why would a person who knows about that hell throw another person into it?!`
` Just because you're bored?`
` Is that all?!"`
`"...............Yeah, that's all.`
` ......It's to escape from boredom.`
` ......Because when we get bored, ......we remember.`
` We remember that hell.`
` .........And, you know,`
` ......by throwing someone else down into that hell,`
` ......we realize that, oh, we're the ones on the throwing side,`
` ......and that means we aren't in that hell ourselves.`
` .........If we don't keep doing that,`
` .........then the fear of that hell will overwhelm us..."`
`"......If you two managed to get out of it, then he can as well!`
` I will save him...!! For certain......!!!"`
`"For {i:certain}......?`
` ......You stand before the Witch of Certainty, {f:5:Lambdadelta},`
` and swear a certain outcome...?"`
`"Yes! For certain...!!"`
`".................................`
` ......Very well.`
` I was the guardian for the former you anyway.`
` ......Though the current you is different,`
` ......I'll do you one last favor.`
` ......I'll give you a parting gift."`
`"And what......is that...?"`
`"Hope.`
` .........The hope that as long as you hold on to your "certainty", your wish will definitely come true."`
`"........................"`
`"Listen.`
` The old you was the Endless Witch {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......You used to love detective novels that depicted impossible crimes,`
` and you used those to make the claim that a witch existed, to make many people believe in magic...`
`as one stage on your path to becoming a witch."`
`"......Detective......novels..."`
`"Yep.`
` The old you was an avid reader.`
` ......A lover of detective novels and locked‐room murders......and a super expert on impossible crimes.`
` After devouring book after book and reading through countless locked‐room tricks,`
` ......you hit upon the ultimate, single, origin trick, and you used it to form the core of your system of magic."`
`"......Battler told you, right?`
` ......He told you that the old you would definitely have thought of a way out of this predicament.`
` .........I'll acknowledge that.`
` I guarantee it by the name of the Witch of Certainty, {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` ......The old you would definitely have solved this locked room trick......!"`
`"........................!"`
`"......That's my parting gift to you.`
` ............Goodbye.`
` You've sworn certainty to the Witch of Certainty.`
` So I won't say farewell.`
` .........‘I'll see you again soon’."`
`"Y‐......yes.`
` .........We'll see you again...soon......!"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} vanished into thin air......`
`And left behind in the witch's tea room...`
` ...were the two who had held the title of Endless Witch.`
`One had empty eyes.`
` The other supported the first by his side.`
`......Ironically, ......it was the exact opposite...`
`...of how their relationship had been in the previous game......`
