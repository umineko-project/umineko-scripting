`.........The eerie sound of the wind and rain.`
`Once again, I hazily regained consciousness on top of the bed...`
`The finger that the witch had bitten off...`
`...was still attached.`
`I didn't say "it was all an illusion"...`
`...just that it was still attached.`
`...After all, the pain and the teeth marks as though a witch had bitten it...`
`......were still there.`
`And yet, the window, which I had supposedly smashed, had been fixed as though it had never been broken in the first place...`
`.........How can I escape this creepy room?`
`Why am I locked up in this eerie room......all alone...?`
`I want to get out.`
` ......I have to get out.`
` ......Let me out of here.........`
`......The door was sealed with a firm chain.`
`I could open it a crack, but only enough to peek out into the corridor at best.`
`......It would probably be hard even to get just a fist through it.`
`The windows wouldn't budge either.`
`{n}They were no better than barred prison windows...`
`The bathroom didn't even have a window.`
`......The only thing that could get out through there was the water that flowed out if you turned on the tap.`
`......No matter how hard I tried, ......I couldn't think of any way out of here.`
`Shut in here like this, I was no more or less than a prisoner.`
`Unless someone came from outside to save me, ......I wouldn't be able to get out for all eternity.`
`.........In that case, couldn't I just call for help?`
`Yes, the tiny gap I could make in that door had to exist so that I could call for help.`
`But......could I make the words come out...?`
`I had tried to call out for help before,`
` but for some reason, the words couldn't escape my mouth.`
`......I might have made some kind of mistake.`
`I might have just lost my voice in my haste and confusion.`
`I cracked the door open one more time.`
`The warm light of the hallway flowed in, making the darkness of the room stand out all the more...`
`Though I couldn't hear any voices, I did feel something peaceful.`
`......I was sure that everyone was in a room at the other end of the hallway, chatting happily about something.`
`If I could just call out, someone would surely come to save me......`
`".........Haah, .........haah, ............nng..."`
`Holding back some indescribable fear, I tried yelling once more...`
`"..................!!`
` ...............!!!`
` .....................!!!!"`
`But the result was the same.`
`It was like trying to yell underwater.`
` ......All I did was get out of breath, unable to call out in the slightest.`
`".........Haah!!`
` Haah, ......haah, ............haah............"`
`Even though I could say as much as I wanted if I just grumbled to myself inside the room,`
` ......whenever I tried to make my voice reach outside, I choked and was unable to say anything.`
`I understood.`
`......My body wasn't the only thing imprisoned in this eerie locked room.`
`......My voice was, as well......`
`Thinking that I could use some other kind of sound to call for help, I tried opening and closing the door violently, making the chain rattle.`
`It did sound as though it was making a noisy clanking sound, ......but I was sure it was no good.`
`Even this sound......was imprisoned within the locked room.`
`No matter how harsh a sound I made, ......I was certain it would be quieter than a leaf falling by the time it reached the other end of the corridor......`
`I tried using the hateful chain that sealed the door to make a sound to call for someone,`
` but that only deepened my despair...`
`"..................?`
` ......This......chain......?"`
`That's insane...`
`Even though just a second ago, it was a stiff chain that looked like it was used to seal a monster away......`
`At some point, .........`
`it had transformed into a normal chain lock.`
`This changed everything.`
`{n}Now I could just undo it from the inside...!`
`I tried to undo the chain, but I couldn't pull it off, the chain not being long enough for that while the door was still open a crack.`
` Of course.`
`"......C‐calm down......`
` .....................*gulp*..."`
`I swallowed, ......and calmly closed the door.`
`Then, ......when I saw that the chain had slackened enough, ...I touched it with my finger to make sure.`
`......When I was little, ......I hated chains, because I could never get them undone right.`
`However, ......that was a long time ago.`
`{n}I could unfasten them normally now.`
`{n}......Anyone could... It was easy...`
`Clink......`
`At that moment, that terrible thought,`
` that the demon who had locked me in this room might have been using this as a trap to give me hope and then make me despair even more,`
` ......finally stopped haunting me.`
`The chain lock unfastened,`
` ......and the chain dangled there right before my eyes.`
`......Now,`
` ......there was no lock sealing this door.`
`Please,`
` ......don't torment me anymore...`
`...and just...`
`......open normally......!`
`......Slowly......the door opened.`
`I had closed the door in order to undo the chain,`
` ......so the warm light from the hallway had been cut off.`
`What if......I opened it again and that warm light was gone this time?`
` ......I was even afraid of that.`
`However, that was............`
`......just me over‐imagining things.`
`Slowly,`
` ......expanding before my eyes,`
` ...no, this is normal for a door......`
`As the door let out an annoying creak,`
` .........the exit from this cursed locked room finally opened......`
`"...............!!`
` ..................!!!"`
`Ha...hahaha, I did it......I did it......!`
`Even my cry of joy was strangled.`
`{n}......But that didn't matter anymore.`
`{n}All that mattered was that I could get out!`
`I poked my head out and looked left and right down the corridor.`
`The warm corridor.`
` I can sense people having fun at the other end.`
` ......Everyone's right there.`
` Let's go, right now.`
`"............Gyeh...k.........?!?!"`
`At that moment, something cold and heartless crushed my throat.`
`It was as though an iron loop had been fastened around my neck and pulled on hard from behind.`
`No...not "as though".`
`......Without my knowing,`
` ......at some point...`
`...a thick, metal collar had been fastened around my neck.`
`When had this happened?!`
` And when I turned around, I despaired even more.`
`From the inner side of the door I had just opened,`
` ......a thick chain extended...`
`...which was connected to my collar.`
`I pulled on it, but it didn't even budge.`
`{n}When I shook it, the whole door creaked.`
`......What...`
`...th‐...`
`......the hell.........`
`The chain that connected to my collar......was attached to the inner side of the door.`
`Yes.`
` The same heartless chain that had secured the door a short while back...had suddenly become a chain holding {i:me} in place...`
`That's insane... That's insane...!!`
`{n}Dammit, what's going on here?!!`
`I pulled with all my strength, trying to tear the whole door off,`
` but I already knew from repeated experiments that it wouldn't even budge.`
`......I was sure this chain would disappear once I went back inside the room.`
`{n}But it would never let me leave it.`
`Though it had appeared to revert to being a normal chain lock, ......nothing had actually changed.`
`The fact that a "chain lock" bound me to that room was just as true now as ever...`
`"......Uuu......nnngh......aaaaaaaaahhhh......!!!"`
`Tears flowing down my face, I pulled with all I had.`
`{n}......It was completely useless.`
` No matter what I did, I'd never tear it loose.`
`And I wasn't even permitted to call out for help.`
`......I felt a confused anger at how the demon had mercilessly made me think for just an instant that I'd escaped.`
`But no matter how much I yelled, no voice came out, and no one on the other end of the corridor could hear me...`
`Then,`
` .........I noticed...`
`...an odd stain on the wall of the corridor.`
`It wasn't a stain.`
` ......They were letters, traced out by a finger that had been covered in red paint.`
`".........?!`
` ............?!?!"`
`Those letters, ......which looked like they had been drawn in blood,`
` answered my biggest question...`
`The chain lock must be set.`
`You may unset it, but it must then be reset.`
`Unless it is set, this exit of yours will be unusable.`
`I instantly understood the meaning of that unsettling message.`
`{n}Then I tried it out, and understood completely.`
`When I return to the room and reset the chain lock, ......the binding around my neck disappears.`
`When I undo the chain lock again, ......that heavy feeling around my neck returns.`
`In other words, I cannot escape this room while the chain lock is still unset.`
`But that means all I need to do is set the chain while outside the room...!`
`I undid the chain one more time.`
`The weighty collar and chain appeared around my neck again.`
`I stepped out into the corridor and closed the door behind me, leaving only the slightest of cracks.`
`I stuck my hand through that crack, grabbed the dangling chain, and tried to reset it somehow.`
`......D‐......dammit......`
`......It's so easy to do from the inside...`
`......so why...`
`...is it so hard to do from the outside...?`
`The gap needed to be wide if I wanted to manipulate the chain well.`
`{n}However, that made the chain too short to reach.`
`To bring the chain even close to reaching, I had to close the door as much as possible.`
`But doing that meant that there wouldn't be enough of a gap to fit my hand in.`
`......Of course, that was perfectly natural.`
`Chain locks are made to be done from the inside.`
`They'd be completely pointless if you could set and unset them from the outside.`
`That's why the length of the chain is specially chosen...`
`to prevent anyone from setting or unsetting it from the outside.`
`Maybe I could manage it with some kind of hard and thin tool?`
`If the gap of the door was just a finger's width across, the chain would have enough length to reach.`
`......If I could just bend a wire hanger so that it fits through the crack...`
`and work the chain with that......`
`That's right, there's a closet just to the side of the door.`
` Could there be some hangers in there?`
`".........Found one...!!`
` O‐......ohh, thank God...!!"`
`A single, cheap‐looking hanger, like one you might find in a laundry room, was hanging there.`
`......Really?`
`I'm pretty sure that when I last looked a short while ago...`
`...nothing like this was in the closet...`
`Ah, who cares...!`
` Quickly......quickly......!!`
`I twisted the wire hanger, bending the end with the tip around.`
`I formed a loop at the end to grab at things with,`
` ......making for a sort of burglar's tool.`
`I then dashed out into the corridor again and closed the door almost as far as it would go.`
`My wrist could never pass through this.`
`But with the door closed this far, the chain should have extra length to spare...!`
`And this crack is large enough for me to stick the hanger through...!`
`Now it's just a matter of technique...!`
`{n}I'll definitely be able to do it if I try enough times... I'm certain of it!!`
`".........Hah......haah.........haah.........haah...!"`
`It's harder than it looks...`
`.......But the chain {i:is} long enough.`
`{n}......It isn't impossible...!`
`I had finally gotten my hands on the one way to escape.`
`{n}......It was hard, yes, but it was theoretically possible.`
`If it was possible, then I would be able to get out.`
`{n}I would be able to escape from here...!!`
`""......Hihi......hihihihihihihihihi......""`
`"......! ...?!?!"`
`At that moment, ......I felt a heavy weight on the far side of the door.`
`It felt as though someone inside the room had leaned against the door...`
`...with their forehead.`
`And she...`
`...the witch...`
`...had laughed.`
`Then, I felt a powerful and strange force on the wire hanger.`
`......Is she trying to grab it away from me?!`
`Yeah right, like hell I'll let go!!`
`{n}Like hell I'll let my one key out of here get stolen while my guard's down!!`
`Fortunately, I had stuck my wrist through it so that I wouldn't drop it if my hand got tired.`
`You won't be able to snatch this out of my hands...!`
`""Hihihi, hihihihihihihihihi......""`
`The witch on the other side of the door watched me and laughed once more......`
`Then, ......I noticed something weird.`
`I looked at my left hand, which I had pressed against the door to hold it in place,`
` ......and between the fingers of that hand,`
` ......I could see something red.`
`.........It was...`
`......red...text.`
`I realized immediately.`
`At some point in time, even more bloody letters had been written on the door,`
` and my left hand had been covering them up.`
`Still fighting against the vice‐like strength of the witch beyond the door, ......I moved my left hand to the side.`
`Where that hand had been...`
`...bloody letters had indeed been written.`
`It read.........as though someone had predicted that I'd struggle this way from the very beginning...`
`...a message directly from the witch to me.`
`No matter the method,`
` it is impossible to set or unset the chain lock from the outside.`
`All tricks done from the corridor......had been sealed by the red letters.`
`"N‐.........no way..............."`
`""Hihihihihihihi.`
` ......Hihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi...!!""`
`There was suddenly a terrible sound, and the force that had been pulling on the hanger was suddenly released.`
`And....when I looked at the hanger that was finally free, I lost all hope.`
`As though it had been hit by the acid of the room's darkness,`
` .........the tip of the hanger...`
`...had burnt and bubbled...`
`...and melted away.`
`Now it was pitifully short.`
` It couldn't be used for anything...!`
`It would be useless to search for a substitute.`
`......All schemes to fasten the chain from the outside...had been sealed...!`
`Dammit...`
`...dammit, dammit, dammit...!!`
`I threw the remnants of the wire hanger against the floor,`
` .......faced the hallway filled with a warm light,`
` ......and called for help.`
`However, I just choked, unable to speak at all.`
`Everyone's just down the corridor.`
`{n}And everything's peaceful there!`
`I can't hear their voices, but I know!`
`{n}I'm sure they're all having a good time playing cards!`
`{n}Please, someone notice me!!`
` Someone...save me!!!`
`""Hi...hihihihihihihi...`
`...hi`
`hi`
`hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!!""`
`Aaaaaaaahgggyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh{0}hh...!!!`
`"""......Ahahahaha, hahahahahahahaha."""`
`This time, it wasn't the witch's voice.`
` ......It was the happy voices of everyone else, which I could hear from the other end of the hallway...`
`Someone, come over here...`
`...and save mee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eee......`
`"Sorry, but I'm out!"`
`George slammed his last card down, ending the game with his victory once again.`
`Everyone gasped in unison.`
`The cousins' room was filled with laughter as they enjoyed their card game...`
`"Whoooooooa, so you really did have it, George‐aniki!`
` Damn you...damn you, six of spaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}ades!"`
`"Your eight of diamonds was pretty nasty too.`
` Aah, I was so close, aha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha!"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` You're incredible, George onii‐chan! You won again!!"`
`"Yep, looks like we've won again.`
` Ahahahahaha."`
`Maria couldn't really hold her own in an all‐out battle.`
`So, she had teamed up with George, which was why she was celebrating his victory.`
`"......Gah.....................`
` ......Utter defeat."`
`Kanon winced and let his cards drop to the table.`
`The game of sevens that Kanon and the cousins had been playing had been a fierce battle.`
`Normally, they would take things easy since Maria was there, so this sort of game was rare.`
`Kanon had started taking the game seriously, unwilling to lose,`
` so George and Battler had responded and the battle had grown fierce.`
`Unlike Battler, who was carefree enough to enjoy it whether he won or lost, Kanon's mood changed drastically with every victory and defeat.`
`......It was less of a dislike for losing and more that he just wasn't used to playing games.`
`He wasn't used to the idea that "you win some, you lose some",`
` so even a loss in a game played for fun was something he took very seriously.`
`Since he had resolved to win and had unfortunately challenged the veteran players George and Battler,`
` the result was plain to see.`
`As Kanon slumped his shoulders, Jessica slapped him on the back.`
`"Hey, you almost had it...!`
` Ahaha, but man, I love this stuff!`
` Fighting all‐out!"`
`"......Whether I go all‐out or not, it's all meaningless if I lose in the end..."`
`"Are you kidding me?`
` If you really give it your all, you can feel good about yourself even if you lose.`
` If you lose after hardly trying, then you feel like grumbling and complaining about how you'd have won if you'd taken it seriously, right?"`
`"That's right.`
` People who really give it their all never complain.`
` Those guys are always cheery no matter what the result."`
`"That's right.`
` And those people are scarier than anyone else.`
` They always learn something from their experience and grow."`
`"......Very true.`
` ...I was a coward, so I could never learn anything.`
` ...So even now, I am yet to mature."`
`I am furniture, so it is useless to dream.`
`{n}Because he had rigidly believed that, he had distanced himself from everything and shut himself away.`
`However, during that time, Shannon had undergone many life adventures.`
`And now, her hand rested on the door separating furniture and {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s......`
`The old Kanon would only have seen this card game as a way to pass the time.`
`However, ......the new Kanon was now capable of gaining something new from this experience.`
`That could probably be called...growth.`
`{n}Furniture does nothing but rot with the passage of time.`
`Being able to grow......is a privilege given only to {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.`
`"Thanks for playing with us.`
` You probably had work to do, like filling in the log, right...?`
` Seriously, thanks for going along with us."`
`"......Not at all.`
` I had fun too.`
` ......Or perhaps I should say......I now understand why doing things like that is fun.`
` Thank you very much for forcing me to come."`
`"Let's challenge ourselves more and more.`
` And let's go and find more and more things you didn't know about."`
`"......O‐`
`oh,`
` so,`
` about what we were talking about...`
` Do you wanna try, like, ...g‐guitar?`
` I, I mean, it's not like you have to or anything, but..."`
`".........It must be very difficult."`
`"Y‐yeah, I guess.`
` But I'll do a good job teaching you, and I'll even practice with you.`
` Well, I guess I'm not that much of an expert myself, hahaha..."`
`At first, Kanon was scared of touching a musical instrument for the first time in his life, certain he would make a complete fool of himself.`
`......He knew that screwing up like that would make him feel bad.`
`......However, Kanon was starting to learn.`
`"It's only natural that I'll be bad when I first start.`
` ......If I just try to run away from that, I'll never learn a thing for all eternity.`
` I'll never achieve anything."`
`"Yep.`
` Isn't that why people love it when they feel themselves improving?`
` Even I sucked at making my left and right hands move at the same time when I first started...!`
` But I slowly got the knack of it, and it started to feel more and more natural...!"`
`"........................`
` ......I'd like to reach that level too.`
` If one path to that goal is playing music with you, Milady, ......I would love to do that with you."`
`"R‐really...?!"`
`"Yes.`
` ......I'm sure I'll be horrible when I start, and I might even make you lose hope in me at times.`
` ......But if I've given it my all, I can take failure in my stride.`
` ......That's what I learned from you all just now."`
`"......Hahahahahahaha,`
` you're embarrassing me..."`
`"Now, .........I love you even more, Milady.`
` Because I averted my eyes for so long, even though you shone like the sun,`
` I never noticed you when you were right there next to me..."`
`"Eheheheh.`
` Then I'd better work even harder to make you love me even more...`
` Ehehihi, hahyahyahya..."`
`Kanon's serious and competitive words were more than enough to make Jessica shy.`
`However, Kanon's expression unexpectedly clouded......`
`".........Milady, the reason I love you is so clear.`
` ......That's why...I can't bear not knowing."`
`"N‐not knowing what......?"`
`"......Why you would start to like me.`
` .........Unlike you, I do not shine in any sense.`
` ......Even now, I'm just clinging to your back as you shine the way.`
` ......I can't think of any reason why you would like a wretch like me."`
`"Th‐......that's not true, okay?!`
` There are all kinds of good things about you, Kanon‐kun..."`
`"......Let me swallow my pride and ask.`
` ......What about me made you like me, Milady?"`
`Kanon hung his head.`
`......He had never learned anything, so he had never been able to take the lead with her.`
`It made him sad and frustrated that he had always been the one‐sided recipient of her affection...`
`...and could do nothing but respond to it.`
`Jessica was lost for words.`
`......After all, compared to the reason that Kanon had fallen for Jessica,`
` .........Jessica's reason......was a lot more vague.`
`She had listened to Shannon talk about her love with George,`
` ......and at school, she and her friends always talked about relationships with boys.`
`There was nothing strange about a girl fascinated by the idea of romance developing an interest in a nearby member of the opposite sex.`
`......However, if she were to put that into words,`
` she would be misinterpreted as saying that any nearby boy would have done just as well......`
`However, ......if nothing else, she knew what she felt at this moment.`
`She really did love Kanon, ......and she truly wanted a relationship with him.`
`They might end up together as a result, or they might not.`
`But whatever the outcome, she could accept it as long as she held nothing back.`
`That allowed her to stay true to her feelings, what she knew she felt right now, and act on them seriously.`
`However, ......she couldn't find the right words to tell Kanon this.`
`When Kanon saw Jessica bite her lower lip in frustration,`
` ............he finally realized...`
`"......I'm such a fool."`
`"Huh?"`
`"What about me do you like?`
` ......That very question is foolish.`
` It's proof that I'm not serious about myself, and that I haven't been able to understand myself.`
` ......It's horrible of me to try and make you say it for me."`
`"Th‐that's not true...!`
` A‐after all, it's the first question any girl would like to ask after being given a love confession...!`
` Th‐the question "What part of me do you like?"..."`
`"It was immature of me to ask you that.`
` How could anyone like someone so immature?"`
`"W‐wait, that's not..."`
`Jessica panicked, trying desperately to explain how she felt.`
`However, Kanon was calm.`
` And then, he spoke.`
`"In that case,`
` .........I want you to grow to love me...`
`...the way I already love you.`
` ......I've decided to change myself so that can happen.`
` I can't possibly hope for you to love me the way I am.`
` ......But someday............no matter what..."`
`"......Yeah.`
` I'm absolutely sure you'll become a wonderful person, Kanon‐kun.`
` A guy so cool that I can't keep my eyes off you.`
` Until then, I'll stick by you all the way.`
` ......We have all the time in the world...!"`
`"..............................`
` ......Unfortunately, there isn't that much time left."`
`"......What about time?"`
`"When I talk about furniture......it usually saddens you.`
` ......But this is something I must talk to you about.`
` And it is also something I must fight for with all my soul."`
`"What are you talking about...?`
` I don't want to hear any more of that "I'm furniture so I can't fall in love" talk.`
` You're a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, not furniture...!"`
`"I understand.`
` That's why I intend to become {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` But at the moment, I am furniture."`
`"Just do it, then! Become {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}...!"`
`"The witch taught me once.`
` ......The single element of this world.`
` She said it was love.`
` ......It's something that {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s born into this world can take for granted."`
`"......However, it is not something that those not from this world, who were born as furniture, can take for granted.`
` .........In order to gain it for themselves, they must have magic or a miracle."`
`......In the same way that Nee‐san and George‐sama...`
`...would never have ended up as they have without borrowing the power of that golden butterfly brooch.`
`"I don't really get this last part."`
`"......What is it that you do not understand?`
` ......Let me hear it."`
`"Since this game began, ......a large portion of the time has been spent on Shannon and Kanon's determination to fall in love.`
` ......I have no problem with interpreting that as a story of growth and teenage determination for a girl and boy who call themselves furniture.`
` However, one of the assumptions they make feels really out of place to me."`
`"...............‘Why is magic necessary?’`
` ......Is that it...?"`
`"Both Shannon and Kanon—no, I'll purposefully refer to them as "furniture".`
` ......The {i:furniture} has always claimed that there cannot be love between furniture and {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.`
` That's where the magic of the golden butterfly brooch came into play—it was the miraculous result of that magic that love was established between Shannon and George onii‐chan.`
` That's what they claim."`
`"Surely it would not be a stretch if they thought that forbidden love across class boundaries...`
`...could never bear fruit without a miracle of magic......?"`
`"Oh, I agree.`
` Shannon and Kanon are both servants in love with members of the Ushiromiya family,`
` so it makes perfect sense to me that they might disparage themselves as furniture while suffering from their forbidden love."`
`"......Then what is it that does not make sense to you...?"`
`"‘Without the power of magic once more, marriage will be impossible’.`
` ......Shannon and Kanon both seem to share that view.`
` ......That's the part that I just can't understand."`
`After meeting in secret for quite some time, George and Shannon had finally gotten engaged.`
`Both were fully prepared for it emotionally,`
` and though there would be some trouble with the relatives, it had gotten to the point where it would probably be impossible for anyone to prevent their marriage.`
`".........Trying to stand between two who wish to be wed is as foolish as standing in the path of an arrow in flight and trying to catch it."`
`"Exactly.`
` George onii‐chan has sworn to protect his partner for the rest of their lives and no longer fears opposition or disinheritance from his parents.`
` ......On the contrary, he even considers them to be the perfect tests to demonstrate his love for her."`
`".........In other words, they will be married no matter what.`
` No one can stop them.`
` And they have both consented to the engagement."`
`"No one can stop them or impede them.`
` Trying to break apart lovers is a foolhardy venture..."`
`"Yeah.`
` And that's what's strange.`
` There's no need for magic."`
`If George and Shannon...`
`...had wanted Eva's approval for their engagement...`
`.........then magic really might have been necessary.`
`After all, Eva had forbidden his relationship with her.`
`No matter how much George spoke on Shannon's behalf, the chances of Eva being convinced were virtually zero.`
`If that were the case, it would be understandable if they wanted a magical miracle to make Eva acknowledge their engagement.`
`"But George onii‐chan has already sworn to it.`
` He doesn't care whether his parents approve of the engagement or not.`
` ......Yeah.`
` There's nothing standing in the way of their engagement.`
` And Shannon should know that well herself.`
` So why is it that now, on this night where the proposal went so smoothly, she's still praying for a miracle of magic?"`
`"......Without such a miracle, she will not have the right to marry,`
` is what the furniture claim..."`
`"And there you go.`
` It means that Shannon has accepted George's proposal,`
` ......but she knows that there's still some kind of obstacle remaining that can't be overcome without a magical miracle.`
` And that obstacle isn't something that they can overcome by their own efforts.`
` That's why they need this miracle called magic."`
`"Why do they need magic?`
` If two people love each other, what other miracle could they possibly need to be together?!"`
`"............Hmm, I see..."`
`{f:5:Featherine} listened to Ange's interpretation, smiling in a satisfied way.`
`......Apparently, she had already reached that conclusion and was enjoying watching Ange finally manage to do the same.`
`"And that same question applies to Kanon as well.`
` ......The love between him and Jessica onee‐chan has just begun, but their emotions are pure.`
` There's nothing standing in their way."`
`"They're already in a loving relationship even without the golden butterfly brooch.`
` ......It'd be no surprise if the relationship they've started lasts for years and eventually results in marriage.`
` There's nothing standing in their way either."`
`"......As long as they do not seek approval from Krauss and Natsuhi, it seems that they will not need a magical miracle either..."`
`"Exactly.`
` ......Kanon watched how Shannon lived, and changed his own way of life.`
` Then, he let his true feelings be known and started a relationship with Jessica onee‐chan.`
` ......There's no need for magic anymore."`
`"......If it were a one‐sided love, then he might need a love charm or something.`
` But their feelings are already mutual.`
` They've already communicated their intentions to one another.`
` ......So why do they need a miracle on top of that?"`
`Both pieces of furniture are in relationships of mutual love.`
`{n}There shouldn't be any need for a miracle any longer.`
`So why...`
`...do they still desire a miracle of magic?`
`And on top of that, the single brooch is portrayed as bestowing only a single miracle.`
`It feels almost as though Shannon is hesitating because, if she uses up that miracle for herself,`
` Kanon's chances at love will be automatically sealed away for eternity...`
`"So the question is this:`
` ‘Why is furniture not allowed to love?’"`
`"......So, you ask why love is not permitted without the miracle known as magic."`
`"And also,`
` ......there's that golden butterfly brooch that can allow the lamenting furniture to have the love they insisted they were incapable of.`
` Just what on Earth is that?"`
`"Of course, it is a crystallization of magic.`
` However, like most magics, it can be burnt by the anti‐magic toxin."`
`"......So, it can only have an effect for those who believe in magic and witches."`
`"Correct.`
` So, Shannon, who was capable of interacting with me, was able to make use of its benefits.`
` However, if Shannon had dropped it in a sandy beach and someone who knew nothing picked it up..."`
`"......If that person was shrouded in the anti‐magic toxin, they wouldn't be able to make use of the brooch's magic power..."`
`"Precisely.`
` A witch's magical items often lose their power if they are not handed over directly."`
`"However, in just the same way that a witch can manifest herself if her existence is acknowledged by a great many {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s and the anti‐magic toxin disappears,`
` the power of that magical item can also be preserved if it is believed in by a great many people."`
`"That's ironic.`
` ......No matter what kind of magic we witches give out, everything depends on whether the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} we give it to can accept it."`
`"I have heard that the same goes for medicine.`
` Even with the exact same medicine, {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s who know of the medicine's effect experience it to a greater degree."`
`"......Oh, I think I understand.`
` When taking cold medicine, I've gotten the feeling that it's more effective when you read the description on the bottle."`
`As she listened, Beato thought that magic sounded a bit like a charm.`
`When most {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s think of magic,`
` they think of incredible miracles being performed one after another in front of a crowd.`
`However, this true magic that the older sister spoke of sounded almost like a charm,`
` something that had no effect if the person using it didn't believe.`
`......Shannon's heart was captured by George bit by bit as he grew by leaps and bounds.`
`However, she had given up, thinking that one of lower status such as herself would never find love with him.`
`That was when {f:5:Beatrice} had given her the golden butterfly brooch and encouraged her.`
`Giving up means that you have zero chance of success.`
`But if, with the power of magic, you think there just might be some chance of your wish coming true,`
` the probability then rises to something greater than zero at the very least.`
`Zero remains zero forever, but if even a faint probability were to exist,`
` ......it would be no exaggeration to say that an impossible miracle had occurred, compared to the time when the probability was zero.`
`Humans can use magic to take "resignation", by which they themselves make the probability of success zero, and cancel it out.`
`When a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} does not give up, though their chances of success may be small, those chances do exist.`
`And the stronger their belief, the more those odds rise.`
`It was easy to imagine that Shannon had made earnest wishes upon the brooch, believed in its effect,`
` ......and made many little efforts to get George to like her.`
`"The power of belief becomes magic......"`
`"And those who make others believe are witches."`
`Those who make others believe...`
`...are witches.`
`......That's an interesting way to put it.`
` If you think about it, it's true.`
`Let's say a witch steps out into a spotlight, waves her staff in front of a crowd of onlookers,`
` and makes a rabbit appear out of thin air.`
`The many people who see it will surely think that it was a sleight of hand.`
`They might wonder at how it was accomplished, but they would be sure that it wasn't magic,`
` and they would applaud the splendid trick that had appeared to be magic.`
`But what if...`
`What if they conducted a sacred ceremony inside a great ancient temple in front of a crowd of believers...`
`culminating in the exact same thing?`
`......Would any of the people there think that was a sleight of hand?`
`In fact, in the ancient past, when magic tricks as a form of entertainment didn't even exist and divine spirits were worshiped,`
` this would doubtlessly have been a miracle of magic...`
`"I‐in that case,`
` ......would this...`
`...count as magic?"`
`"Oh?`
` Will the witch who cannot use magic now perform it for the first time?"`
`"H‐......here I have an empty tea cup.`
` There is nothing inside it."`
`"Mhm, it is empty.`
` *giggle*, go on."`
`"I will take this cup,`
` ......turn it like this,`
` ......and place it upside down on the table."`
`"Heheheheheheh.`
` And then? What next?"`
`"Umm,`
` ......le‐let's both close our eyes and chant the incantation."`
`It was......the same magic that had been used to give Maria candies.`
`Beato the Elder grinned and closed her eyes.`
`When she saw this, ......Beato slowly chanted the incantation.`
`"C‐come, try to remember.`
` ......What was inside the cup?"`
`"Hmm.`
` Come, try to remember.`
` What was inside the cup?"`
`As she chanted,`
` Beato slowly opened her eyes and made sure that the older sister was repeating her with her eyes closed.`
`Then, a single gold butterfly appeared out of nowhere,`
` ......fluttered down onto the overturned cup, and scattered away in a spray of gold.`
`"May I open my eyes now?"`
`".........Y‐yes.`
` Please open your eyes and inspect the contents of the cup."`
`"Well now.`
` ......Let us see how well your first bit of magic has worked."`
`Taking her time and dragging out the suspense a little, the older sister......lifted up the cup.`
`".........Aha."`
`"H‐how is it......?"`
`When the cup was lifted up,`
` .........there lay......a single golden rose petal.`
`"D‐...does this count as...magic......?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*......`
` Yes, it most certainly does.`
` {p:41:You used magic to create a golden flower petal inside an overturned cup.`
` It was a splendid bit of magic}."`
`"‘Without love, it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}’.`
` That much I understand."`
`"It may be viewed as a trick.`
` It may also be believed to be magic.`
` ......It all depends upon the toxin of the individual..."`
`"Then again, ......while this can explain some of the magic that's been used in the past, it can't explain everything."`
`"To get back to the point, none of this stuff about believing in magic and charms can answer the question:`
` "What is the golden butterfly brooch that can allow the lamenting furniture to have the love they insisted they were incapable of?"`
` It's not enough for an answer."`
`"......To take what we heard from the two Beatos at face value,`
` ......would it not make sense to consider that magic has the power to cancel out the furniture's "resignation"?"`
`"‘Why mustn't furniture fall in love?’`
` "Why is the power of the magic brooch necessary?"`
` ......Yes, it does seem at a glance as though what you and the Beatos are saying provides an answer, though a vague one.`
` However, let me say this as a Reader.`
` ......I can't accept this as you've presented it."`
`"You cannot accept it, you say...?"`
`"......The fate that those pieces of furniture were fighting to overturn was something much more immense than this would allow for.`
` I doubt they could reform their way of thinking just because they were given a charm for making relationships."`
`"It's true that the brooch gave Shannon the chance she needed to get together with George onii‐chan,`
` but after that, she said she wanted to deepen their relationship without borrowing the power of magic, and she even tried to give the brooch back to Beato.`
` She put the miracle of magic behind her at that point.`
` ......In that case, why is she once again in need of its power?"`
`"Well now.`
` ......Perhaps there is no way to say it except that love and marriage are very different things."`
`{f:5:Featherine} laughed lightly.`
`......She had probably formed a theory of her own and was laughing at Ange, who hadn't reached it yet.`
`"Let me hear it.`
` What's your view?"`
`"I'd like to keep that to myself for just a while longer.`
` ......And of course, watching you form doubts and let your mind race is one of the joys of being read aloud to.`
` If I gave you my views, you would accept them and stop thinking.`
` Then, having you read aloud would be no fun."`
`".........So, you're having me read a mystery novel you already know the answer to, just so you can enjoy watching me blunder about."`
`"Well, I am the Witch of Theatergoing.`
` ......If you wish to laugh at my bad taste, please do not hold back, my miko."`
`"‘Wa‐ha‐ha‐ha.’"`
`"Pft, ......*giggle*giggle*, haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha..."`
`I understand that a part of magic is created by a believing heart.`
`And that magic probably permeates deep into the world of us {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s as well.`
`However, though it does permeate so far, the power that dwells within magic is small.`
`Visiting a shrine before an important exam to pray that you'll pass is something that many people do.`
`However, not many people will actually credit that visit as the reason for their success.`
`Praying like this contains no power except as a calming influence.`
`In love, where even a small chance and a little bit of courage can cause a major change,`
` this power might cause a massive upheaval...`
`However, .........would the insurmountable fate that those pieces of furniture claim to be in the middle of...`
`really change because of something like that......?`
`I think that in the past, the magical power of the brooch as it joined Shannon and George was little more than a good‐luck charm.`
`However, at this point,`
` the magical power that the pieces of furniture are seeking from the brooch, praying for their love to succeed...`
`......It's not something as vague as a charm.`
`It feels much stronger, like {i:a whole different interpretation of magic}.`
`If you believe in a sleight of hand, it becomes magic.`
`......But that's no more than a child's trick.`
`{n}And that only explains one part of magic.`
`They...are hoping for something.`
`They're hoping for something with much, much more power...`
`...for true magic, not a sleight of hand.`
`"......So then, just what kind of magic...`
`......are the pieces of furniture expecting from that brooch......?"`
`".........A golden butterfly...brooch...?"`
`"The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`......gave a magic charm to Shannon in exchange for smashing a mirror—a charm that makes love succeed.`
` ......That's what this is."`
`From his pocket, ......`
`Kanon pulled a wing of a gold butterfly.`
`Though it was just a single wing, it was easy to tell from its distinctive shape that it had originally been part of something with a butterfly motif.`
`"The magic of this brooch gave Shannon the chance she needed to start her relationship with George‐sama.`
` ......However, before that magic was fully realized, she left it to me.`
` ......So, thanks to the power of this brooch,`
` .........I gained your affection, Milady."`
`"That's not true...`
` I started liking you because of my own honest feelings..."`
`"......Thank you very much.`
` ...You are {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, so you do not believe in witches or magic.`
` It's only natural.`
` ......However, as furniture created by magic, my very existence here...`
`...is proof that the miracle of magic exists."`
`"S‐sorry,`
` what are you talking about...?"`
`Jessica tried her hardest to grasp what Kanon was trying to say.`
`However, she couldn't understand it, and had to ask him to repeat it with a bitter smile...`
`"...........................`
` ......Both Shannon and I...`
`...need magic to succeed in love.`
` The key for that is this brooch.`
` ......I stepped on it and crushed it, so we each have one part."`
`The brooch had lost its power when it was split in half.`
`{n}However, if it was ever joined together again, ......its magic would be revived.`
`It would revive the miraculous power that could join furniture and a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} together...`
`"However, a single brooch can only grant one person's wish.`
` ......Only one of us furniture can be joined by this single brooch."`
`It was the single spark of love that the old {f:5:Beatrice} with her shrill laugh had sown on a day long ago.`
`That {f:5:Beatrice} had likened humans who were tormented by this spark to ripe fruit and taken evil pleasure in their suffering.`
`However, the magic infused within this spark...was real.`
`It was the only crystallization of magic that the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} ever left in this world......`
`Its shine......grew brighter.`
`"Huh? ......Wh‐...what the...?!"`
`"It's okay.`
` ......But please don't look right at it.`
` It'll blind you."`
`"Gh, .........ghhh.........!"`
`It grew more brilliant still, shining like the sun.`
`Jessica didn't need Kanon to tell her to put her hands over her eyes......`
`As the light grew stronger, ......a sound like the roaring of the wind or the tide also grew in intensity.`
`It already drowned out the sound of the wind and rain outside...`
`Jessica could no longer even stand, and she crouched on the floor......`
`It was a flood of sound and light...`
` And until it withdrew, Jessica could do nothing but moan......`
