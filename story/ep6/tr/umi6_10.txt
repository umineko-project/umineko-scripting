`As usual, this year's family conference was getting bogged down.`
`Everyone had decided to cool their heads for a moment, and a short break had been agreed upon...`
`The four siblings could say whatever they wanted,`
` but Natsuhi and Kyrie, for example, were outsiders and found it difficult to speak freely in this sort of atmosphere.`
`A conference where you aren't allowed to say what you want can be tiring even as you just sit there quietly.`
`Even Kyrie couldn't help letting out a deep sigh...`
`".............................."`
`This was the second floor hallway of the mansion.`
`Rudolf had wanted to be alone during the break, so she had felt like doing the same...`
`...and had drifted up the stairs to reach this place.`
`Her expression was less tightly controlled than it was when her husband was around.`
`{n}......Kyrie wore a tired look that she didn't often show.`
`She pressed her forehead against the cool window glass.`
`I need to regain my spirit and support my husband.`
` Even if I'm not allowed to speak.`
`......That's the duty I've won.`
`".....................Who is it?"`
`She suddenly sensed another person, turned around,`
` and saw Jessica standing at the other end of the hallway.`
`"..........................."`
`"Oh, it's you, Jessica‐chan.`
` ......Didn't you go to the guesthouse?"`
`"......Well,`
` ......I just decided to head back to my own room for a bit to get a book."`
`"I see.`
` And now you're on your way back to the guesthouse?"`
`"Y‐yes.`
` That's right......"`
`"What horrible rain.`
` Is the wind really strong...?"`
`"It's weak right now, relatively speaking......"`
`As Kyrie looked out the window, ......Jessica watched her back, looking agitated...`
`"......Auntie Kyrie...`
` ......I'm sorry, you just had bad luck..."`
`"Ah, Zepar!`
` Jessica's roulette of fate has chosen Kyrie!"`
`"What will you do, Jessica?!`
` The roulette has chosen Kyrie, but you may reject that choice and spin the roulette again if you wish!"`
`""It doesn't matter whose life is sacrificed for this trial...!!""`
`Jessica wasn't like George.`
`George had willingly chosen Eva to be his sacrifice,`
` to signify his separation from his old life so that he could step into a new life married to Shannon.`
`However, Jessica hadn't thought of any particular target.`
`......So, she had left it up to the roulette of fate.`
`That "roulette" was nothing very grandiose.`
` ......She had simply walked around at random, imposing a rule on herself saying that the first person she met would be chosen as the sacrifice.`
`And so, ......the roulette of fate had brought her to Kyrie...`
`Of course, there was nothing forcing her to keep to that rule.`
`However, it was the rule that she had decided upon, and she didn't want to break it now.`
`......Now that she was participating in this demons' game, this was the one bit of justice that she could cling to...`
`Right now, she could attack that unprotected back...`
`{n}But Jessica still wasn't able to fully resolve herself.`
`"........................`
` ......What is it?`
` Do you have something to say to me...?"`
`Noticing Jessica's strange silence, Kyrie turned around.`
`{n}......That unprotected back was already gone.`
`Jessica realized that her hesitation had cost her her own first chance...`
`......She had taken on this demons' game to prove her love for Kanon.`
`However,`
` ......would it really be alright to sell her soul to demons...`
`...for the sake of love...?`
`Not wanting to let George, who had already come to terms with the situation, get any more of a lead on her, she had energetically consented to this demons' game, but...`
`......her heart still wasn't ready......`
`"Umm, ..................`
` ......M‐maybe I shouldn't be asking you this, Auntie Kyrie........."`
`"......What is it?`
` It's rare for you to ask me questions, Jessica‐chan.`
` ......I hope I'm capable of answering it for you."`
`"Actually, umm, ............I...`
`have someone I like."`
`"Oh, really?`
` That's wonderful, *giggle*.`
` Then is it love you wanted to talk about...?"`
`"E‐......eheheh...`
` ...Yeah, ......pretty much."`
`".........Alright.`
` I'll help out if I can."`
`"Th‐thank you very much...`
` ......Actually, umm......"`
`"Is it still one‐sided?"`
`"No, ......I guess you could say that it's just become mutual...`
` But, well, .........there's this trial......for us to be joined together......"`
`"A trial?`
` What are you talking about?"`
`"......There's the two of us and another pair of lovers......and we have to fight each other."`
`"A love triangle?`
` Or a love rectangle...?`
` Sounds complicated.`
` ......And?"`
`"Only the pair who wins can be together...`
` ......It's something complicated like that.`
` So it's like, um—"`
`".........Sounds nasty.`
` ......Love that can only succeed at another couple's expense."`
`"Yes...`
` ......If we join up, ......then they'll fall apart.`
` ......And the same the other way around."`
`"......I think I see where you're going with this.`
` ......Something like this, right?`
` "To what extent is a person allowed to climb over others in their own pursuit of happiness", ......right?"`
`".............................."`
`It was once again apparent......just how smart Kyrie was.`
`She immediately figured out the question that Jessica wanted to ask most...`
`"If you don't fight, it automatically means that they win and you lose.`
` ......However, if you do fight and win, you cause the other pair to break apart.`
` ......It's nasty either way.`
` But the answer is obvious."`
`"............Yes......"`
`Kyrie giggled.`
`......If she wasn't willing to commit to her love, then that would show the measure of their relationship.`
`{n}If that was the case, she should just let the other pair of lovers win.`
`However, if this was a love she couldn't abandon,`
` ......she couldn't abandon the victory either.`
`So, ......she had no option but to fight.`
`In the end, Jessica's hesitation was caused by guilt...`
`over forcing the others to split apart as the result of her inevitable decision......`
`"......I guess...`
`......I'm just...`
`...being soft after all......"`
`"Yep.`
` ......That you are."`
`"...........................`
` ......But stepping over someone else for the sake of my own love,`
` ......it feels......horrible..."`
`"In that case, what about the one you love?`
` ......Will you give up on them?"`
`"......That's......"`
`"I can tell you one thing for certain.`
` Doing that would feel even worse.`
` You'll be forced to crawl through hell.`
` ......For the rest of your life."`
`A hardness had entered Kyrie's gaze...`
`"......I was just six, so I didn't understand much about it at the time,`
` ......but I found Mom's notebook among her belongings after she died."`
`"Was it a diary...?"`
`"It was more a collection of her thoughts.`
` It was much less organized than a diary would've been.`
` ......I found it and read it right after she passed away,`
` ...but I needed to wait a long time, until I'd grown for several years, before I could understand it."`
`".........I see.`
` ...So, did it speak of Kyrie's worries about her marriage?"`
`"It was......practically a book of curses.`
` ......It cleared up several things that six‐year‐old me had always vaguely sensed."`
`When I was six, it seemed as though my parents were very close and had no problems.`
`......And though I did think it odd that Onii‐chan lived separately when he was meant to be part of our family,`
` and I did wonder why he only came home every once in a while,`
` I accepted it as the way things were.`
`"Did you not know about Asumu?"`
`"......I think Onii‐chan talked to me about her when no one was around, but there was no way an elementary schooler like I was could understand.`
` ......After all, I never even saw a picture of her.`
` ......Mom had sent all of the pictures with Asumu‐san in them to Onii‐chan, leaving none behind in the house."`
`In front of Ange, and even in front of Battler who only rarely came home,`
` ......Kyrie's smile never faltered.`
`If she hadn't written her thoughts in that notebook, Ange would probably never have known them.`
`Rudolf had been particularly popular with the opposite sex since his school days—a typical playboy.`
`Audacious, over the top, and yet not lacking a little gentleness towards women,`
` he had probably built up a formula for getting women to like him.`
`Plenty of women approached him, using various seductive tricks to try to win his favor.`
`Rudolf probably enjoyed that more than anyone.`
`Since the beginning, love had been a game to Rudolf.`
`He never thought of it as a trial and error process to find a single life partner.`
`He would intentionally spark jealousy between women and revel in the harem, lapping up their flirting.`
`......He may be my father, ......but he was an awful man.`
`"But at the same time, Dad must have looked down on those toadying girls.`
` ......Mom, who had her own set of values and was extremely intelligent, must have stood out."`
`"......Though even that might have been due to the skillful way Kyrie tried to catch Rudolf's gaze."`
`"...........................`
` ......Yeah, maybe.`
` Mom was smart in many ways."`
`Like the other Ushiromiya siblings, Rudolf had strong ambitions and lofty goals.`
`Under the mottos of "who dares wins" and "it's not a crime if you don't get caught",`
` he would set up businesses that were borderline swindles or bending the law, then bail out of them, and repeat that process over and over.`
`Apparently, he was already making use of that talent in his college years, cleverly making money by thinking up shameless projects and selling cheap tickets to parties for them,`
` so much money that he could brag about how his wallet was always stuffed with a hundred 10,000 yen notes......`
`Many women fell for his charisma in being the man responsible for these radical projects, ...as well as his thick wallet and generosity.`
`......It would be a lie to say that Kyrie was not one of them.`
`However, what made Kyrie very different from the other women...`
`...was that she could also support Rudolf as a business partner.`
`Rudolf would laugh all the way to the bank as his large‐scale party succeeded.`
` His female entourage would surround him.`
`And Kyrie would be the only one among them able to calmly point out several ways that income and expenditure could be improved upon,`
` and even lay out a proposal for the next project.`
`"In that manner, ......Rudolf must have slowly begun to accept her as a partner."`
`".........Just like some people say men don't belong in the kitchen,`
` ......there's also a sense that women should stay out of financial affairs.`
` ......It's "normal" for women to be treated by men.`
` ...The details of how those 10,000 yen notes were scrounged up are vulgar, so they don't ask, don't know, don't even care."`
`"So, you're saying that Kyrie viewed money from a man's perspective..."`
`In that regard, Rudolf noticed something unique about Kyrie.`
`He knew all about how much hard work it took to make just one of those 10,000 yen notes.`
`So, somewhere inside him, he looked down upon those extravagant women who never even considered the efforts he had undertaken.`
`......Among all of them, only Kyrie possessed the same sharp financial intuition as Rudolf...`
`Every time Rudolf thought of a new plan, he would talk to Kyrie about it, work out the kinks, and make it succeed.`
`In this way, Kyrie steadily worked her way up until she was the number one of Rudolf's large group of followers.`
`"But Mom was still a woman.`
` ......I doubt she enjoyed seeing Dad pampered by all the other girls."`
`"......So, she would rather have been his only one, instead of his number one..."`
`"Yeah.`
` Though she served as Dad's right hand, she slyly got rid of the other women in the shadows.`
` ......It was only a matter of time before Mom would succeed in her love."`
`"When did Asumu come into the picture?"`
`"......She was one of those who swarmed around Rudolf‐san.`
` ...No, not even that.`
` She was just one of his fans."`
`"Did you ever talk with her...?"`
`"Of course.`
` ......I knew her well.`
` Ever since the very beginning, before Rudolf‐san even knew her name.`
` .........I'm sure she was quite intelligent herself.`
` And cunning.`
` ......I tried to use my intelligence to stick out, .........but she took the exact opposite approach."`
`"......By her...stupidity......?"`
`"*giggle*...`
` .........I mean she was good at triggering his protective instinct.`
` Out of all the girls who came to flatter and flirt with him,`
` ......only she stood out with every action she made, unlike the flashy girls Rudolf‐san had tired of."`
`......Even now, Kyrie recognized the mistake she had made in letting Asumu and Rudolf get too close.`
`Kyrie had thought that by taking the role of his business partner, she had succeeded in making him entirely hers.`
`......She might have been a little conceited.`
`And her arrogance in trying to eliminate the relationships the other girls had with Rudolf might also have contributed.`
`Perhaps she sometimes tried too hard as a business partner,`
` putting too much pressure on him, regardless of the fact that it was justified.`
`Bit by bit, Rudolf started to need a woman who could stay quiet and soothe him,`
` ......without making him think about anything complicated.`
`.........That woman was Asumu.`
`"I am ruthless and intellectual.`
` Rational and economical.`
` ......In a plank of Carneades situation, I would push the other person off without hesitation.`
` ......I thought that was the kind of partner suitable for him."`
`However, though that ruthlessness had made her reliable on the business side of things...`
`......outside of business,`
` it might have disturbed Rudolf deeply.`
`At some point, ......though Rudolf still acknowledged Kyrie's skill, he began to yearn for a quiet, warm acceptance.`
`Asumu filled that role completely.`
`She would never talk about anything complicated.`
`{n}Even if he did, she would just shake her head to say she didn't know.`
`However, she would care more for him physically than anyone else, quietly putting a blanket on him and staying by his side until morning...`
`"......Yes, I did get the position of his business partner.`
` ......But before I knew it,`
` ......Rudolf‐san had grown a need for a mental partner, someone who could heal his heart.`
` Foolishly enough, despite claiming to be the intellectual one, I never noticed."`
`"............And then...`
`...Uncle Rudolf...`
`married Aunt Asumu......?"`
`".................................`
` ...Yes, that's right.`
` She stole him away from me."`
`"........................"`
`"He had slept with a lot of women.`
` ......By that point, he wasn't the kind of guy to let his emotions be captured by a woman just because he slept with her.`
` After all, sleeping with women was just a game to him.`
` .........That's why I used something other than my body to attract his attention."`
`"......Conceit.`
` A woman's downfall..."`
`"Before long, they were both pregnant.`
` ......Asumu‐san told Dad about it right away, but Mom did the opposite."`
`".........She must have been afraid that pregnancy would threaten her position as his business partner..."`
`"Apparently, Mom wasn't eating much at the time and was often out of sorts.`
` Because of that, it took a really long time before she realized she was pregnant."`
`"When did she notice...?"`
`"......It was after Asumu‐san suddenly moved into Dad's family register.`
` ......Mom learned about her pregnancy after that and plotted several times to split Asumu‐san and Dad apart, but..."`
`"Even though Asumu‐san.........always appeared to be so absentminded,`
` ...once she got her hands on Rudolf‐san, she wouldn't let go.`
` ......‘What do you want? Please stay out of our way’, she'd say.`
` ......And this coming from that sissy little girl who'd curl up into a ball every time she got on a bus."`
`".........At that point, I realized.`
` ...She had been the truly cunning one.`
` ......Yes, even her fear of vehicles was another lie to catch Rudolf‐san's sympathy.`
` ..............."`
`".....................My apologies.`
` I must be boring you."`
`"Oh, ......no........."`
`"At the very least,`
` I wanted him to register himself as the father of my child.`
` ......And it does seem as though Rudolf‐san was prepared to do that.`
` He made sure there was a hospital waiting for me, and even though Asumu‐san was close to giving birth herself, he gallantly came to see me.`
` .........Even though she was already his wife.`
` What an awful man, really......"`
`After that......is the tale I can't bear even to tell.`
`Both Asumu and I......had the same delivery date.`
`And yet, her pregnancy led to marriage, ......while mine was completely meaningless.`
`I swore to bring up my child well, so that Rudolf‐san would be proud to call himself its father.`
`Asumu‐san had won her battle against me.`
`{n}......However, I hadn't yet lost the war.`
`If I could make my child excel far more than Asumu‐san's,`
` if I could make my child the one that Rudolf‐san most respected, I would be rewarded.`
` .........That's what I believed.`
`"However, ......Kyrie's child was stillborn."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Asumu‐san gave birth to Onii‐chan.`
` ......But Mom didn't give birth to anyone.`
` ......Even Mom's final hope of being left a spot as Dad's second wife...was destroyed......"`
`Kyrie had fallen from his partner to his second wife,`
` ......and then, unable to give birth to the bond of a child, ......she tumbled down......to being merely his mistress.`
`I can't imagine...`
`...how much she must have hated Asumu and her child, ...Battler.`
`"......But despite that,`
` ......Mom was able to act in a very friendly way towards Onii‐chan.`
` .........It was definitely a shock for me.`
` To discover that my kind and gentle mother had held such negative emotions towards Onii‐chan......and managed to hide them."`
`"........................`
` ......She must have despised Battler."`
`"I don't doubt it.`
` ......If Asumu‐san's child had been stillborn and Mom had been the one to give birth to Onii‐chan,`
` ......history might have changed in some way.`
` It seems she thought that if that had happened,`
` she might have been able to make things play out in a way that Dad would divorce Asumu‐san and marry her instead."`
`".........Was that...also written in that book where she kept her thoughts?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ......It truly was a collection of random thoughts, fantasies.`
` .........Mom's resentment, as she chewed on the corner of her tear‐stained bed sheets."`
`"There's just one thing I regret."`
`".........You mean...the pregnancy?"`
`"No, no.`
` .........It's my arrogance I regret.`
` ".........Rudolf‐san is already mine, so I'm completely safe.`
` ......I'll never lose to that Asumu girl.""`
`"......While she was screaming and shrieking on buses and planes, I was capable of properly managing the travel arrangements and expenditures.`
` ......And so, I was overly confident......that I was the one Rudolf‐san trusted the most."`
`"........................"`
`"They say love needs to be nurtured, right?"`
`"Y‐......yeah."`
`"That's not wrong.`
` ......You both need to water that tree, care for it, and nurture it.`
` ......And at the end, it will finally bear the fruit called love.`
` Did you know?`
` It isn't over when it bears fruit.`
` ......You have to harvest that love, or it will never be realized."`
`".........Harvest......?"`
`"You need to think about that yourself, Jessica‐chan.`
` ......If you make the tree bear fruit without harvesting it, it can sometimes grow rotten.`
` And bugs will often gather around it.`
` In fact, ......sometimes thieves will come by and pluck it off the branch."`
`"..........................."`
`"Young kids like you, Jessica‐chan, think that love ends with nurturing.`
` ......That's naive.`
` ......If you don't harvest it, you will never be rewarded for your love."`
`"Harvest......love......"`
`"At a glance, it may seem to be a matter just for the pair of lovers, but that isn't true.`
` Putting off the harvest because you assume you can do it at any time just gives the thieves a chance."`
`"......What if that fruit you've worked so hard to nurture gets pulled off the branch the next morning?`
` ......You'll regret that you didn't choose to harvest it the previous day instead of putting it off.`
` ......That regret really hurts.`
` ......It'll make you crawl through hell."`
`"........................"`
`"I was lucky.`
` My hell ended after 18 years.`
` ......So, I'll never misjudge myself again.`
` ......That man is mine.`
` I won't let him get away. I won't let him out of my sight.`
` And I'm grateful to my masters.........`
`for giving me that chance.`
` My "absolute, certain willpower" in not giving up on that man no matter what was answered with a "miracle"."`
`By now, Jessica was speechless......and didn't even nod her head in understanding.`
`......This true form of love that Kyrie was telling her about...`
`was far, far more harsh than anything she had imagined...`
`"Now,`
` ......I will do anything to keep Rudolf‐san by my side.`
` And I will show no mercy to his enemies.`
` ......If he wished it, I might not even hesitate to commit murder."`
`".........Because I finally gained that determination, on the 18th year,`
` .........that absolute willpower...`
`...brought about a miracle for me.`
` .........You know, miracles only come to those who can make them come true themselves."`
`Asumu's death was no murder.`
`However, Kyrie had often cursed her and hoped for her death,`
` ......and finally, on the 18th year, she built up the determination to kill her with her own hands.`
`And then, ......she actually......got herself a knife with which to do the deed.........`
`That was when the miracle occurred......`
`"......Aunt Asumu passing away......was a miracle......?"`
`"Not really.`
` ......That wasn't even close to a miracle."`
`"............Huh?"`
`"After all,`
` ......if she hadn't died, I would have killed her.`
` ......In other words, she was fated to die no matter what.`
` ......The miracle was that, even though she did die,`
` {i:I didn't have to get my hands dirty}.`
` That's all."`
`......Until now, Kyrie had never shown Jessica...`
`......no, she had never even shown Rudolf...that glint in the deepest depths of her eyes.`
`It told plainly and clearly...`
`that romance and love are not the sweet and fluffy candies that young girls imagine them to be.`
`Jessica was overwhelmed by that pressure......and stunned silent.`
`{n}And she had to acknowledge it.`
`{n}This was.........the power of will that could make love be realized.`
`This was the level of willpower Kyrie showed in her support of Rudolf as his wife.`
`And it was the same for George.`
`......He already had the willpower to confront everything in the way of his love that transcended status,`
` and he had proven that.`
`Now, ......Jessica could clearly understand.`
`This was the magnitude of George's determination,`
` which had allowed him to coldly carry out his part of the demons' trial...`
`Then, ......what about her.........?`
`Did she really have the resolve to make her love with Kanon bear fruit...`
`and to go through with the task of harvesting it.........?`
`"*giggle*, I'm sorry.`
` I only meant to give a little advice, but perhaps I scared you a little too much.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*.`
` Blame the weather.`
` I just wanted to pressure you a bit, but I've gone overboard."`
`Kyrie let a relaxed smile rise to her face.`
`{n}The tense atmosphere finally slackened.`
`......However, her words had been gouged into Jessica's heart.`
`"I don't know what your love has been like, Jessica‐chan,`
` .........but if you have a rival and neither is willing to back down, you can't let yourself become complacent."`
`"......If you do, you'll end up like me.`
` ............Every woman should have one time in her life...`
`when she would kill for the sake of love.`
` ......I can tell you that all women in the world who call themselves mothers have been through that.`
` After all..."`
`"Women who don't do that are chewed to bits by the others and forced to crawl through the hell of envy and regret for the rest of their lives.`
` .........My hell lasted 18 years.`
` ......I was lucky to be pardoned after just 18.`
` ......That hell is still filled with women......who will never get out until they die.`
` ......Unless they execute themselves in their regret."`
`"........................`
` ......Wow, I......I have no words."`
`"*giggle*.`
` ......I was trying to spur you on, but here I've gone and frightened you too much.`
` ...I'm truly sorry.`
` ......Love can be much more easygoing than that, okay?`
` Love really is like playing with fire.`
` Anyone can play easily and lightheartedly.`
`......But when you mess up and get burned, that scar stays with you your whole life.`
` .........*giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`Regrets in love will never fade.`
`That was all that Kyrie had been trying to communicate.`
`......It wasn't like Kyrie to tell her life story instead of just saying something like that directly—in fact, her past was a topic she usually avoided.`
`However, ......Kyrie might have felt as though Jessica deserved to hear.`
`Jessica had timidly brought up the subject of love.`
`......Perhaps Kyrie had opened up and told everything...`
`...because she had seen the fires of Jessica's determination in her eyes.`
`"Well, I'd better head back.`
` ......Let's keep what we've talked about a secret, okay?`
` Eheheheh..."`
`With a mysterious smile on her face, Kyrie turned around.`
`.........I wonder if I scared her too much.`
`Still, it's a hundred times better to learn of that hell from a warning.`
`......Once you've fallen into it, it's already too late.`
`Good luck, Jessica‐chan.`
`Your love sounds like a handful, but don't let yourself be beaten.`
`Eheheh, it's not every day I get to act as a mentor...`
`"......Hmm?`
` What is it, Jessica‐chan...?"`
`What—`
`A windstorm grazed Kyrie's head.`
`It had missed by a hair.`
`If Kyrie hadn't twisted her body slightly, that fist would probably have been buried in her face by now.`
`A bitter smile rose to Jessica's face when she saw that her first strike had failed to land a kill...`
`"Just so you know, I didn't try to sucker punch you because I'm a dirty coward...`
` ......I hoped to end it with a single painless strike before you realized what was happening..."`
`".........Didn't I tell you that I've lived through the hell of jealousy?`
` I've come close to getting stabbed in the back a couple times before.`
` I know how it feels just before a surprise attack."`
`"You mean you could sense it...?"`
`"That, plus the lie you told in the beginning."`
`"......A lie?"`
`"Come now.`
` If you had come from your room after picking up a book and were on your way back to the guesthouse, you wouldn't have come through this hallway in that direction.`
` ......Chessboard theory led me to seven possible reasons you might have had for lying,`
` and this was the worst‐case scenario."`
`Telling a hasty lie to Kyrie would only put her on her guard.`
`If Jessica hadn't told that lie, her surprise attack would have succeeded.`
`".........Not bad.`
` ......I should have expected that from you, ...Auntie Kyrie."`
`"Why me?`
` You were planning to kill me from the beginning."`
`"It didn't matter who it was."`
`"Just my luck."`
`"It's what you said that gave me the boost I needed.`
` .........Thanks a lot......"`
`".........Wha............?!"`
`Kyrie dodged the punch, placed her hand against that fist, and slammed it against the wall.`
`Ordinarily, being made to punch the wall should have caused Jessica to hurt her own hand...`
`...and roll around clutching it in pain...`
`However, Jessica's fist...`
`...had left what looked like a meter‐wide crater in the wall.`
`Instead of a look of anguish after smashing her fist against the wall,`
` Jessica clicked her tongue in irritation at having missed...`
`"......Incredible.`
` I see that you are your father's daughter.`
` Have you taken up boxing too...?"`
`Impossible... Jessica is barehanded.`
`{n}She isn't holding any sort of weapon at all...!`
`"............Please don't resist, Auntie.`
` Just one strike to the head...`
` I promise you won't feel a thing."`
`Kyrie tried to look confident, but she couldn't hide her confusion at this unreal destructive force.`
`If that punch had hit, her head probably would have split open like Jessica had said, killing her without any pain.`
`"Here I come........."`
`".........!!!"`
`If Kyrie's kick off the ground and leap backward had been an instant slower, her gut would probably have been pulverized.`
`Though she had avoided it by a hair,`
` Jessica's left body blow was followed by a terrible tornado‐like gust of wind, which blew Kyrie back.`
`"......Is this a dream?`
` Am I still sleeping?!`
` I...I don't understand!"`
`This Jessica looked like the normal Jessica, but something was different...!`
`{n}It wasn't human, and common sense didn't apply to it!`
`This had to be......some kind of nightmare...!!`
`Kyrie slowly stood up.`
`Then, she looked at Jessica, noticed the several meters between them...`
`and realized just how far that blast of wind had sent her flying.`
`"..................Feel free to hate me.`
` ...But...`
`......just like you,`
` ......I can't back down.`
` .........I can't let...`
`...my love...`
`...finish half‐hearted."`
`".........What are you talking about...?`
` What are you saying?! What on Earth is going on?!`
` Someone, tell mee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e!!!"`
`The air around Jessica seemed to bend like a heat wave.`
`It seemed to be enshrouding her fists.`
` ......And, it seemed as though something like a red magic circle had appeared beneath her feet.`
`She looked just like a Western demon standing amidst the flames of hell.`
`"...Flame upgrade.`
` ......Mass upgrade.`
` ......Armor‐piercing upgrade."`
`Each time Jessica muttered, her fists were surrounded by a pulsating, sinister, red light.`
`......Those fists, which were even giving off smoke,`
` surely represented...`
`......the iron hammers of hell wielded by demons...`
`"G‐goodbye!! This is just a nightmare...!!"`
`Kyrie dashed away with lightning speed.`
`Yes—right now, that was her best option.`
`She was smart enough to realize that pinching her cheek wasn't the best way to wake up from this nightmare, and by now, this came as no surprise.`
`"......Ronove."`
`When Jessica muttered once more, a blood‐red magical barrier blocked off the corridor.`
`{n}Kyrie slammed into it hard and realized that her path of escape had been cut off.`
`"Gah,`
` ......st‐`
`......stop this, this...madness...!!`
` This is...`
`......a nightmare,`
` ......it's a nightmare...`
` ......Let me wake up...`
`......quickly......!"`
`"......Yeah, this is a nightmare......`
` .........I'll wake you up right now, if that's what you want.`
` .........Just one strike... Don't move......"`
`Jessica slowly stepped forward towards her, enshrouded in flames...`
`Each time her feet lifted off the floor......boiling steam hung around her footprints...`
`This was......a true nightmare......`
` ......Kyrie clutched her head in her hands, shaking it over and over again......`
`"It's a nightmare, right......?`
` This is......a nightmare, isn't it.........?`
` Please, tell me it is......!!"`
`"Yeah, it's a nightmare."`
`"It is, right...?`
` It's a nightmare, right......?`
` Ah, ......aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahh!!"`
`"I'll recognize that.`
` ......This is a nightmare."`
`"I do too!!`
` I recognize that this is a nightmare!! S‐so please—"`
`"I'll wake you up......with a single punch!`
` Rrrraa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh{0}h{0}h{0}h{0}hhh!!!"`
`"Ack.........ggha...gh...............kh...??"`
`Jessica's neck twisted at an odd angle,`
` ......and she staggered backwards, her eyes rolled back into her head,`
` as though she didn't have a clue what had just happened.`
`A demon stake......was buried at an angle into her forehead.`
`It pulled itself out of her, spun around, then became Leviathan and landed.`
`The hole left behind in Jessica's head spewed blood.`
`"Leviathan the Envious, right here......!"`
`"If this is inside a nightmare anyway, .........why not have the friend that shows up in my nightmares?`
` My friend from the hell of envy.`
` Thanks for showing up just in the nick of time."`
`"......It's too early to thank me.`
` She's......not down yet...!!"`
`".........Gah............gah......"`
`Even though she had taken a deep gouge to the top of the head,`
` ......Jessica just stood there, convulsing and white‐eyed, and didn't fall over.`
`The blood stopped pouring out of her forehead, ......and her blank, doll‐like eyes returned.`
`Then, she slowly pressed her own palm against the wound in her forehead.`
` ......There was a sizzle, as though she had pressed a hot iron against it.`
`It was easy to imagine that she was doing this to seal up the wound.`
`If Kyrie didn't escape now, there would never be another chance...!`
`"Can you defeat her...?!"`
`"Impossible.`
` ......She has a contract with one of the Great Demons... She's immortal...!"`
`"That is because of love!!`
` That is why she is immortal!!"`
`"Yes, love is magnificent!`
` Those with our blessings cannot be killed!!"`
`"Can we break that red magic wall?"`
`"Ronove‐sama is also a Great Demon.`
` There's nothing I can do...!"`
`"Can we escape out of a window?"`
`"The windows are no good either!`
` They were blocked by Ronove‐sama's barrier a while ago...!"`
`"Incredible. Does this mean she sold her soul to demons for the sake of love?"`
`"How could she make so many contracts with Great Demons...?!`
` Aah, I'm so jealous...!!"`
`".................................`
` ......Armor upgrade.`
` ......All‐attribute defense,`
` counter‐attacking armor upgrade."`
`In response to these words, this time her entire body pulsated with a red light.`
`......She had upgraded herself with a defensive power that would ensure Leviathan's attacks would never work again......`
`"What is she talking about...?"`
`"......Self‐augmentation.`
` It's a kind of enchantment.`
` ......Right now, she has enough defensive power to prevent me from piercing her,`
` and she even has the power to reflect the damage back upon the attacker!`
` ......She's no longer {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}. She's a monster...!!"`
`"Oh, so that's all.`
` Then not much has changed."`
`"How can you say that?"`
`"Just like in the very beginning, we still have no chance of winning...!!"`
`"..............................`
` ............That hurt.`
` ......But it won't...work again."`
`Jessica slowly...`
`...lifted the hand that had been covering her forehead...`
`...and there was no longer any hole there.`
`The hall was blocked by barriers in both directions, and even the windows were sealed.`
` There was no way out.`
`"Is the door to this room sealed?"`
`"No, it's just locked.`
` ......But it's just a normal room.`
` It does have windows, but they've already been sealed.`
` In other words, that's a locked room, and a coffin for us...!"`
`"A coffin is just what I need. Unlock it.`
` ......Aah, I'm jealous, why are you the only one who can unlock it?!!!"`
`Leviathan's stake flew about at high speeds, ramming itself into the keyhole to that room.`
`The tip of the stake had become a key.`
` As soon as it was unlocked, the door flew open.`
`Both of them fell into the room and quickly locked it.`
`This was probably...Krauss's study.`
`Its soothing furnishings brought about a sense of nobility that Krauss would probably like.`
`"Even if you lock it, she can just smash through it with one punch!!`
` You've just put the lid on your own coffin!!"`
`"However, if she wants to send us a killing blow here inside this coffin, she'll have to take the lid off first!"`
`".....................?"`
`With dim eyes, Jessica tilted her head upon hearing Kyrie's words.`
`"............What are you talking about...?`
` ......How will such a small room...be able to protect you...?"`
`"This room may be a locked room.`
` It may leave us with no method of escape.`
` However, even you can't break into this room.`
` That's what a locked room is!"`
`"......What are you talking about......?`
` How does this tiny room,`
` ......with its tiny door, make you think you've gotten away from me......?"`
`With a confused expression on her face,`
` Jessica looked wearily between her own burning fists and the door.`
`Then, slowly, ......she sent that pulsating, red light to her fists......`
`She repeatedly enchanted her fists to give them the destructive power for the killing blow.`
`"......I'll smash this door to bits........."`
`"If you think you can,`
` give it a try."`
`"K‐Kyrieeeeeee......!!"`
`Responding calmly through the door, which was the only thing separating her from Jessica, Kyrie placed a single index finger on it as if to hold it shut.`
`Jessica slowly...`
`...raised a fire‐wreathed demonic fist......`
`"......So long, Auntie Kyrie......"`
`"Kyrieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!`
` ............{0}......{0}..................?!?!"`
`"...............Oh........."`
`Jessica's fist slammed into the door in slow motion.`
`It was the same kind of slow motion often seen as a special effect at the climax of a movie.`
`However, this was no special effect.`
`......Jessica's fist really was...slowing down as though it was being sucked in......like a spoon sinking into a jar of honey.`
`That punch...was no longer a punch.`
` It was no more than a knock.`
`"I'm envious of you."`
`"...............Envy......"`
`"I crawled through the hell of envy for 18 years because of my arrogance and naivety in love.`
` ......So I envy you.`
` ......You're going to remember my warning, succeed in love, and walk a beautiful life, right......?"`
`"...........................Hah..."`
`"......Aah, I envy you.`
` You'll get to live through the most beautiful time in a woman's life...for a full 18 years longer than I did.`
` ...Aah, I envy you so much...!!"`
`Jessica tried to slam her fists against the door over and over again.`
`{n}However, as soon as her fist approached it, its speed plummeted.`
`She could barely knock, much less smash the door...!`
`"............Speed upgrade.`
` ......Instantaneous force upgrade.`
` ......Speed of sound upgrade."`
`"It's useless, darling."`
`"......Break............!!!!"`
`With full speed upgrades, Jessica's fist moved at the speed of sound, {nobreak:1,225 km/h}.`
`However, how long had Jessica been in envy to gain that speed?`
`She had started to envy George and Shannon's relationship about......two years ago?`
`{n}2×365=730 days,`
` 730×24=17,520 hours.`
`However, she wasn't envious all the time.`
`{n}It only happened when Shannon started going on about George.`
`{n}With Shannon's shift on about 3 days of the week, ÷7×3.`
`And it wasn't as though she would go on about George all day long.`
`{n}Her fond words for him would only leave a mark on Jessica for about......an hour?`
`So only one 24th of each day.`
`{n}17520÷7×3÷24=312 (rounded down).`
`The number of hours that Kyrie had been jealous was 157,680.`
` {n}In other words, this was a scant 0.2% of the time that Kyrie had been jealous.`
`Even 1225 km/h, the speed of sound, becomes only {nobr:2.45 km/h} in the 1/500 world.`
`"......Understand?`
` ......You're lacking in both love and envy."`
`"..................!!!"`
`Even Jessica's sonic fists...`
`...were no faster than a walking child in Kyrie's world.`
`Jessica ground her teeth, her fist still pressed against the door.`
`If someone could have seen this from both sides of the door, it would have looked as though Kyrie was holding it shut with a single finger...`
`"Way to go, Kyrie...!!!"`
`"See? This room is a locked room.`
` At most, Jessica‐chan can knock on the door, but she can't lay a finger on us inside!"`
`"Ah, {f:5:Beatrice}'s definition of a locked room."`
`".........What the hell...?"`
`"Then this locked room will be somewhat troublesome.`
` It is impossible for a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} to carry out a locked‐room murder.`
` ......Only magic can do that.`
` ......Until you truly understand magic, you will not be able to break through it."`
`"You can't corner me any further...!`
` As time passes, the relatives will eventually realize that I haven't returned, and they'll start searching the mansion.`
` And then, you will be observed.`
` Witches and magic alike disappear when they're observed.`
` .........The nightmare is already over, darling!!!"`
`"......D‐......damn...it..............."`
`"Oh?!`
` I can't believe Jessica is going to drop out all of a sudden!!"`
`"Oh, please give it your all!`
` Do it for your beloved Kanon!!"`
`""Come, Jessica, believe in love and let us see a miracle!!""`
`"Let me make a correction.`
` There isn't even any need to wait for time to pass.`
` ......After all, there's an extension telephone right here.`
` Of course, the internal phone line hasn't been cut."`
`"......I'll just...pick up...`
`......the receiver!!`
` This is...my...`
`......checkmate!!!"`
`".........Construction completed.`
` .........Locked‐room murder."`
`"......Aha.`
` ......Yes, that is valid."`
`".........Permeation upgrade.`
` .........Attack transmission,`
` indirect attack power upgrade."`
`"Huh..............."`
`Jessica's fist, which was pressed against the door, glowed red...and then white hot...`
`Jessica didn't even swing her fist.`
`{n}She just kept it pressed against the door.`
`However, ......Jessica's "murder" reached inside the "locked room"......`
`Through the cracks in the study door, through the keyhole...burst the flames of hell.`
`Jessica couldn't see what was happening inside the room.`
`......However, even here, on the other side of the door, she could tell that the flames of hell had swallowed the entire room.`
`"Ggh...`
`......gyah...`
`.........gah...`
`............"`
`Kyrie's smoldering death throes could be heard from across the door.`
`Jessica clearly heard as Kyrie danced a dance of death amidst the hellfire,`
` ......fell to her knees,`
` ......and slumped over to the floor.`
`Slowly, ......Jessica tore her burning fist away from the door.`
`".........If you love the hell of envy so much,`
` then burn.`
` ......Burn in the flames of envy...for all time.`
` .........There are probably some things that can be learned from envy.`
` However, it's nothing to be praised, and it's no one's duty.`
` ............It seems you were too proud after all,`
` ......Auntie Kyrie."`
`"......A splendid......locked‐room murder."`
`"Could you take care of the mess?`
` .........I'd hate for her body to be burnt to a crisp when it's finally found.`
` ......Do you think you could clean it up...?"`
`"As you wish, Milady."`
`Ronove transformed into a gold butterfly and entered Krauss's study through the keyhole.`
`......Then, he had to cross his arms and think...`
`...about how he should even start cleaning up Kyrie's unrecognizable corpse and this room that had ended up as a burning hell...`
`"....................................`
` ......Haaah.........haah..."`
`Jessica finally let out the breath that she had been holding down in her chest...`
`Her normal {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} glint finally returned to her eyes...`
`......And then, ...she couldn't help but shudder at what she had done,`
` ......even if it had been just a trial on the game board for the sake of her love...`
`"......Is that what you wanted, demons?!"`
`""Yes, well done, Jessica!`
` Your love is the real deal!!""`
`"........................"`
`George welcomed Jessica with crisp applause.`
`......Beato timidly tried to join him, but Jessica yelled at them and she stopped.`
`"......It's just something that happened on the game board.`
` There's no need to look so sad about it."`
`"I know that logically!!`
` But still, ......how am I supposed to just accept it emotionally?!!"`
`".........Milady—"`
`"Kanon‐kun, ......I...love you...!`
` I can't give up...!!`
` That's why I've shown how strong my feelings are...!`
` I...didn't do something wrong, did I?`
` I'm not wrong, am I?!`
` Uuu...aa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ahh......"`
`"...............Milady..."`
`As Jessica started to sob, ...Kanon held her quietly.`
`{n}And he realized that he would have to carry on the determination she had shown him...`
`"You didn't make any mistake.`
` ......And it also isn't a mistake to keep your human heart and be sad.`
` ......I just happen to be a bit more of a stoic when it comes to that sort of thing."`
`"......Not everyone can match up to George‐sama's level.`
` ......But, in any event, you have completed your trial, Milady.`
` ......Well done. I admire the strength of your determination."`
`"Hmm, very true.`
` Both George and Jessica...`
`have splendidly succeeded just the same.`
` Very impressive, Jessica!`
` ......That "locked‐room murder" just now was wonderful enough to fascinate even a witch like myself."`
`Jessica had used "magic" to kill Kyrie, who had holed up inside a closed room.`
`In that instant, Jessica had "constructed" a locked‐room murder,`
` had it acknowledged by the demons, and raised it to the level of magic...`
`"The trials for the two of you have been completed!!"`
`"So then, who will take the next challenge?!"`
`"Will it be {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama?!"`
`"No, no, it might be Shannon!"`
`"No, this has to be Kanon's time to shine!"`
`""Come, speak up!!`
` Who is next?! Who will take the next trial?!""`
`".....................nn—"`
`"What witch would hesitate at committing murder on the game board?`
` Even excess shyness can kill love."`
`"..........................."`
`"Come!! Who will be next—"`
`"To carry out a murder of love?!"`
`"....................."`
`".................."`
`"............nn—"`
`The three who remained looked at each other.`
`......‘If the other two are going to spend a few more moments hesitating to raise their hands, I will raise my own instead.’`
`......All three thought this at the same time.`
`So,`
` they all raised their hands at the same time.`
`......The ones they loved had already shown their determination.`
`{n}They had to carry on.`
