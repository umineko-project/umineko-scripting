`A beautiful glow shone in from the skylight over the grand cathedral.`
`The place was somehow different from the way it had been during the witches' trial.`
`{n}The decorations had changed.`
`The several pleasantly sparkling white ribbons were paper‐thin, but they hung beautifully in the air.`
`Flowers were arranged all over in a way that would make any place look cheerful.`
`It was like how a single drop of impure water could spoil an entire cask of wine.`
`Just the presence of the flowers, the ribbons, and the red carpet that ran down the center of the room...`
`made it hard to believe that this was the same place Ushiromiya Natsuhi had been falsely accused of a crime...`
`It had truly become......a wedding chapel.`
`"Love is generous, love is merciful!"`
`"Love does not envy, it does not boast!"`
`These words, spoken by two demons who seemed to be in charge of this gathering, were part of a ceremony for making an oath of love before the eyes of God.`
`Of course, in this wedding celebrated by demons, there was no priest in sight.`
`{n}Instead, there stood the witch who controls miracles.`
`"In sickness and in health.`
` ......Yeah, a wife's true job is to be supportive in times of sickness.`
` Isn't that right, Erika?"`
`"......Yes.`
` My master......"`
`"That looks good on you.`
` What a fitting outfit for the one who has conquered the bridegroom.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"Ehehehehehehehehehe.`
` I'm honored, my master."`
`The bride standing on the carpeted path...was Furudo Erika.`
`{n}......The groom's face couldn't be seen.`
`The bride's outfit was, without a doubt, a pure‐white wedding dress.`
`The bride's veil represented both the white of God's blessings...and the white of the demons' cruelty.`
`A great many goat nobles, witches, and demons were gathered for this wedding.`
`If only their heads hadn't been those of goats,`
` it would probably have seemed to be a very refined crowd worthy of this great cathedral...`
`"......I'd expect no less of you, Bern.`
` Every single thing you come up with is always so screwed up."`
`"A wife to support her ailing husband.`
` ......Isn't that wonderful?`
` It suits you, Erika."`
`"......And......congratulations to you too,`
` ......Mr. Groom."`
`At that point, ......{f:5:Bernkastel} stared straight into the groom's eyes.`
`The groom...`
`...didn't answer.`
`His eyes were gray.`
`......His lips would mutter something from time to time, but no one could tell if the words meant anything.`
`{a:c:`
`"Hey, ......{i:are you listening}?`
` All of you?"}`
`She spoke to the groom in the plural.`
`{n}......Of course, there was only one groom.`
`And, of course, the gray‐eyed groom didn't answer...`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*.`
` You can hear, but you can't answer, right?`
` ......Don't worry, okay,`
` Battler‐san?"`
`"...............nn..................gah......"`
`"I'll take everything of yours,`
` ......and trample all over it......`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"Ehhahahahahahahaahahahahahaahahahahaha...!!"`
`The Witch of Miracles sneered with an evil smile that would make even demons want to avert their gaze.`
`Even that sneer...`
`...provoked no response...`
`...from Battler's dim eyes.`
`"People live for the sake of love!`
` Therefore, today, you have fulfilled the purpose of your lives."`
`"Oh, how great is the power to live, the power of love...!`
` I pray that the brightness of this day blesses these two for all time!"`
`"......Just give it a rest already, you demons.`
` What comes next?"`
`"The couple will now make an oath of eternal love."`
`"After that, they will exchange rings...!"`
`On Battler's hand......was a ring bearing the seal of the One‐winged Eagle, proof that he was the territory lord of this world.`
`And on Erika's finger was a diamond ring that could not be shattered by any miracle.`
`Diamonds signify an "eternal bond".`
`{n}However, in Greek, the word for "diamond" simply means "unbreakable".`
`Erika wasn't vowing to love Battler forever.`
`{n}She just wanted to take Battler as her property for all eternity.`
`This wedding was being performed......for the sole purpose of humiliating Battler.`
`"......Don't worry.`
` I won't love you forever.`
` After all, the point of this ceremony is to make you submit to me.`
` ...Your heart will be shut inside an inescapable locked room forever......where I, Furudo {f:5:Erika}, the detective and the Witch of Truth, will command it.`
` Your position as territory lord and your ring will become mine..."`
`"...........................Can't...`
`...get..."`
`"......Hmm?`
` What was that?"`
`"........Nn......gah.........`
` ......Can't......get out......"`
`"Heh, ...ha, ......hahahahahahahahaha...!`
` Yes, I'll bet you can't get out of that locked room.`
` After all, you made that locked room yourself.`
` You will suffer in that room for all eternity.`
` I'll remain by your side as your wife for eternity......and get to enjoy that look of anguish on your face all by myself."`
`"*giggle*giggle*, ahhahahahahahahaha...!!`
` I'll defile you forever.`
` ......Ushiromiya Battlee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eer!!!"`
