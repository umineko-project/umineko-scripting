`......All that could be heard was the sound of the wind.`
`A sound of misfortune, strong enough to bring sadness and unease to those who heard it.`
`Slowly, ......I came back to my senses.`
`I finally regained consciousness on top of a bed with a firm mattress...`
`Where......was this, again...?`
`I couldn't remember where this was,`
` ......but I could vaguely recall......that it was very bad for me to be here.`
`The room was dimly lit.`
`There was a light on, but that just made the darkness and eeriness of the room more apparent.`
`There were no curtains over the window, but it was too dark outside to see anything beyond it.`
`If I squinted into that pitch‐blackness,`
` ......it felt as though I would see the witch of the forest peeking back at me through the darkness,`
` ...and I averted my gaze from the window in fear.`
`......I couldn't see or hear it,`
` ......but I got the feeling that if I left this room, it would be bright and warm, and someone would be there for me.`
`I have to get to where everyone else is right now......`
`A bad memory from when I was very young began to well up.`
`I was having trouble staying awake during a family gathering, and the next thing I knew, I was lying on a bed in a room I'd never seen before.`
` I have the horrible, painful memory of waking up there feeling incredibly lonely and crying my eyes out...`
`This room—I'm not supposed to be here.`
`I just want out.`
`Once I started to think that way, I didn't want to stay in this room a second longer than I had to.`
`This room scares me.`
` It's creepy.`
` ......Where is everyone?`
`{n}I want to get out of here right now...`
`I opened the door, trying to leave the room.`
`A pleasant glow snuck in through the crack of the door.`
`{n}......As I'd thought, the corridor was filled with a comforting light.`
`I couldn't actually hear them, but I could sense that far away, people were enjoying themselves.`
`......Everyone else must be gathered in the room across from this one.`
`......I've been shut up in this lonely, creepy room......all alone...`
`I should go, quickly.`
`As soon as I thought this, a merciless metallic sound rang out, and the door refused to open any further.`
`.........The chain had been set.`
`I've always hated chain locks.`
`You can open a normal lock just by twisting.`
`......But chain locks are built in a kind of annoying way where it's difficult to undo them easily.`
`...So I've hated them since I was very young.`
`.........See?`
` ......Even this chain...`
`is causing me trouble...and I just can't get it undone.`
`Why is this happening? I just want to leave this creepy room right away...`
`Just on the other side of this thin door, everything is bathed in a warm light...`
`I can't undo it...... I just can't undo this chain.`
`The more desperate I grew,`
` the more the unsettling darkness of this room seemed to close in on me from behind, and the more frightened I became...`
`......Then, I finally noticed.`
`There was something......wrong with this chain.`
`......Yes, there is a chain,`
` ...but this isn't a chain lock.`
`This is just a chain staked into the door so that it can't open any further...`
`In other words, it isn't made to be opened.`
`"Wh‐......what the hell's going on......?`
` Who'd do something like this, dammit..."`
`No matter what I did, no matter how much I struggled, I couldn't pull out the stake or undo the chain or break the mechanism.`
`This door was just a demon's mouth...made to trick me into thinking it would open before crushing my hopes a moment later.`
`Even so, if only I could just open this door somehow, I could get out into that pleasant corridor......`
` This desire forced me to keep my hand glued to the doorknob.`
`But it was useless.`
`Both the chain and the stake were firm, and though they clattered about, there was no chance of them letting the door open any further.`
`Even though I could see the pleasant hallway through the crack, I had no chance of opening the door any further.`
`Maybe someone will come if I yell...`
`Maybe the door can be opened easily from the outside...`
`When I thought this,`
` ......I tried to call out to someone,`
` ......but it was as though the wind had been knocked out of me.`
`I could mouth the words "someone, come here",`
` but no voice left my lips.`
`What's...going on...?!`
`{n}Someone, come...`
` Why can't I cry out...?!`
`Help me help me help me.`
`Not even being able to say "help me" out loud scared me more than anything.`
`And if I turned around,`
` ......the witch gazing into the room from the darkness outside...`
`...might now be inside the room, standing right behind me......`
` I'm frightened... I'm scared I'm scared I'm scared...`
`Someone help me, someone help me...`
`I can't get out... I can't get out...`
`Let me out......of this room......`
` Help me,`
` I'm scared`
` I'm scared`
` I'm scared,`
` let me out`
` let me out`
` let me out,`
` help me`
` help me`
` help me......`
`"Missy, it sounds like they've arrived."`
`"Huh?`
` .........Oh, ........."`
`Amakusa ran his finger down my cheek.`
`I awoke in an instant from the doze I had just been in.`
`I glared at Amakusa for waking me up in such a creepy way, but he just played dumb.`
`Where......is this?`
`It feels like a parlor in the house of some well‐off person,`
` ......but I have no memory of this place at all.`
`"....................."`
`Where......is this......?`
` ...And......why am I......?`
`"Are you still half‐asleep, missy?"`
`"......Yeah, sorry.`
` Where are we......?"`
`"Huh?"`
`Apparently, he hadn't expected me to forget something like that just because I wasn't fully awake yet.`
` ......Oddly enough, I agreed.`
`Why am I in this parlor that I don't recognize?`
`The sound of the footsteps of the person—or people—that Amakusa had mentioned...`
`had come right up to the opposite side of the door.`
`I could hear the sound of a conversation.`
` They were probably women...`
`Judging by the coffee and snacks laid in front of me, I was the guest here.`
`In that case, I'd better remember why I came here...`
`...or at least who it was I came to visit...`
`Who am I?`
` Ushiromiya Ange.`
`Who is the man standing behind me?`
`Amakusa Juuza.`
` The man who used to be my guard long ago.`
`{n}He's now the bodyguard Okonogi assigned to me.`
`......In that case, ......after Aunt Eva died...`
`...I must have thrown off my pursuers...`
`......and gone on a journey to find out what happened on that day twelve years ago......`
`......Is that...what happened...?`
` ...Did I have...{i:a memory of this}......?`
`After a knock, the door opened,`
` and the person I must have come here to meet entered along with a maid.`
`......Oh, wonderful.`
` ...Even after seeing her face, I can't remember who she is.`
`"Sorry to have kept you waiting.`
` This is Hachijo Tohya."`
`That's a relief.`
` The maid introduced her to me first.`
`...And, I finally remembered who she was...`
`"She"?`
` I was sure it was a "he"......`
`"Excuse me, ...but are you...?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......I am Hachijo Tohya ({p:0:八城十八})."`
`"The magazines talked about your book signing event.`
` Supposedly, a mysterious male author showed up wearing sunglasses and a mask...`
` Never thought you'd be a woman...... What's the deal?"`
`"......That was just a double set up by the editing department.`
` I was the assistant standing behind him at the book signing."`
`"Heh, now there's a shock...`
` ......I haven't read your works,`
` but I'll bet you're even more of a mystery than your books are."`
`"My readers only pretend to read my books.`
` ......They buy them just based on the name of the author and the brand and think that they've actually read them."`
`"......No matter what I write in my books, they don't truly read anything.`
` They just pretend to read so they can look smart and knowledgeable and keep up with the current fad.`
` ......Am I supposed to expose myself to these people?`
` Why indulge such trash?"`
`"......I see.`
` Looks like......you really are the great Hachijo."`
`This person really is eccentric...`
`{n}There's no doubt about it... This is Hachijo Tohya herself...`
`Hachijo Tohya is a mystery novelist who's become the center of discussion lately.`
`Although her actual books are also apparently highly praised, it's her mysterious debut that's attracted so much attention towards her lately.`
`Last year, she somehow managed to win several different awards for exceptional mystery novels offered by multiple large publishing companies,`
` submitting each of her works under a different pen name.`
`And after that, several highly regarded anonymous works were discovered, one after another, to have been stories she had written in the past under false names,`
` and her popularity soared as she herself became more mysterious than her books.`
`Despite all of this, the author herself never appeared in public, and everything about her was wrapped in a veil of secrecy.`
` However, just a few days ago, this author had finally made a public appearance for a book signing, showing up with a mask that covered "his" face and drawing even more public attention...`
`......And yet, apparently even that had been a fake.`
`Given this person's radically unconventional track record,`
` it was hardly a surprise to hear her casually insult her fans like this.`
`"I know quite a lot about you, too, Ushiromiya Ange‐san.`
` The talk shows have been discussing you for some time now..."`
`"I'm sure you've heard nothing good."`
`"Yes.`
` Nothing good at all.`
` Apparently, you employ and then fire people on a whim,`
` think anything can be resolved with money, and are an outlaw and a thug."`
`"Yep, sounds about right.`
` Heheheh!"`
`"However.`
` ......I happen to like intelligent people like you."`
`"......Is that why you agreed to meet with me?"`
`"Exactly.`
` You're the only person who's managed to spot that Itouikukuro0576 is another pen name used by Hachijo Tohya.`
` That's actually pretty impressive..."`
`"Itouikukuro0576.`
` It was a pretty strange username.`
` However, if you match the Japanese syllables to numbers, you can read it as {nobr:{ruby:i:1}‐{ruby:tou:10}‐{ruby:i:1}‐{ruby:ku:9}‐{ruby:ku:9}‐{ruby:ro:6}‐0576}."`
`11,019,960,576.`
`{n}This massive number is equal to 18⁸.`
`Eighteen to the eighth power.`
` In Japanese, "tohya no hachijo".`
`......That's how you reach Hachijo Tohya...`
`"Heheh, ......very well done.`
` I was quite impressed.`
` In fact, I was so impressed, I decided to let you meet me in person.`
` ......Welcome to my mansion, child of man."`
`Her manner of speaking was extremely condescending,`
` but, perhaps because of her elegant manner, it didn't feel particularly irritating.`
`This person had a sort of majestic grandeur about her which made that style of speech seem almost natural.`
`{n}......At least, that's how it felt to me.`
`.........In fact, it felt almost as though this was the manifestation of some noble being,`
` who would have no need to show herself before mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s under normal circumstances.`
`Since I'm not particularly a fan of hers,`
` I guess this is proof that her mysterious charisma really is nothing to be laughed at......`
`However, I didn't come here to talk to Hachijo Tohya, the mystery novelist.`
`......I'm interested in Itouikukuro0576,`
` the mysterious web author who only releases her works over the Internet...`
`Around the Japanese parts of the Internet, Itouikukuro is an extremely famous Witch Hunter.`
`However, she isn't a big opinion leader like Professor Ootsuki.`
`She's one of those "message bottle Forgers" who are always the center of vigorous debate...`
`Message bottle Forgers are, as the name suggests,`
` people who forge and post the contents of riddle‐filled message bottles which purport to tell the story of the Rokkenjima incident.`
`Claiming to have discovered a new message bottle,`
` they post either a very similar counterfeit or a new theory with their own interpretation of the truth, claiming that it was written by Ushiromiya Maria.`
`They openly call themselves "Ushiromiya Maria",`
` write up a new bizarre tale as if they had been there themselves and knew the truth,`
` and send their stories out into the newest sea that {y:0:Humans have}{n:0:mankind has} discovered—the Internet—calling them the third or fourth message bottles...`
`All of the first Forgers were either simple pranksters...`
`or crooks trying to swindle collectors.`
`However, eventually, people who claimed to have solved the riddles of the message bottles' tales and reached the "truth" started to appear,`
` and they started work creating third and fourth message bottles from Ushiromiya Maria, as though they had moved over to the riddle‐teller's side.`
`These people rewrote the tale of the witch with whatever interpretation they wanted, and every once in a while, certain theories would gather an enormous amount of support on the web.`
` Because of this, some of these "creations" began to be so widely trusted that they were believed to contain some grain of truth.`
`The more rigid Witch Hunters openly despised these people, calling them "Forgers", "Counterfeiters", or just "Witches".`
`Though they claimed to have reached the truth, they refused to tell it, and created fake message bottles as though testing everyone else.`
`It's no surprise that the serious Witch Hunters were very annoyed by these Forgers...`
`However, there were many people who simply liked to entertain themselves with the occult fantasy of Rokkenjima,`
` and a small number of those accepted these creations as literary works,`
` glad of this expansion to the mysterious tale...`
`Of all the Forgers, Itouikukuro was the one most highly regarded.`
`"......End of the Golden Witch.`
` I read that one of yours.`
` ......It's nice to know you have no qualms about killing off other people's families."`
`"Is that why you came all this way? Just to say that...?`
` I think not, final descendant of the Ushiromiya family."`
`In her latest forgery, "End", she killed off at least seven of my relatives during the story.`
`No, if you count "Alliance" and "Banquet", the other forgeries she's made before now,`
` then she's killed off most of my family in horrible ways, over and over again...`
`Of course I'd want to complain.`
`However, all of her works are known for being, in both form and level of completion,`
` the closest tales to those written by "Ushiromiya Maria" herself.`
`In particular, Itouikukuro's first forgery, "Banquet of the Golden Witch",`
` was a depiction so complete that it even included Ushiromiya Eva's escape to Kuwadorian.`
` People wondered whether this might be the true story of Rokkenjima, and it even made it onto the talk shows...`
`So far, all of these tales have been nothing more than electronic text on the web.`
`......However, people will eventually realize that Itouikukuro is actually Hachijo Tohya.`
`When that happens, these tales will become associated with "that bizarre Hachijo", and no one will think of them as mere fan creations.`
` ...People will probably start wondering if this might actually be a third message bottle she found and released under the guise of a story she herself wrote.`
` When that happens, these stories will probably seem even more bizarre and credible...`
`"......You are cunning, aren't you?"`
`"Why do you say that?"`
`"You're doing this to make your forgeries more mysterious and more credible."`
`"And what do you mean by credible?"`
`"Once you've gained credibility, your forgeries will rise to the level of truth."`
`"Rise to the level of truth?`
` Hmph, how foolish.`
` Such a thing is unnecessary for my works."`
`"......Is that because your works are the truth, and not mere forgeries...?"`
`"Correct.`
` They are the truth, so there's no need for them to rise into anything."`
`"You aren't Maria onee‐chan.`
` And you weren't on Rokkenjima on that day.`
` So how can you be so absurd as to call this the truth?"`
`"Missy, you're getting a bit too stirred up."`
`"Shut up. How can you call this stirred up?"`
`"*giggle*......"`
`Ange realized that she'd let her emotions get control over her.`
`She let out a sigh and shrugged...`
`"Your reason for coming here.`
` It wasn't to yell at me for murdering your family several times within my forgeries, correct...?"`
`Hachijo had been smiling at Ange kindly, ......but in a condescending manner,`
` or else, like a mother might watch over a very small child.`
`Ange realized this and was unable to suppress her irritation.`
`Apparently, Amakusa could tell that Ange was getting worked up.`
`He joked around with her for a bit so that they could start the conversation over again from the beginning.`
`"The thing you came here to hear...`
` ...It's the "truth" that I've reached, is it not?"`
`"............Why are you so sure that you've reached the truth...?"`
`"Because I've understood all of the tales."`
`"And I'm asking you why you're so sure about that."`
`"......Do you think the Sun ever revolved around the Earth?"`
`Hachijo suddenly started talking about the geocentric model.`
`......Ange was about to tell her not to answer questions with more questions, but she quickly realized what Hachijo meant.`
`"......{y:0:Human}{n:0:Human}s used to support geocentrism.`
` However, that theory has been disproved in the modern age.`
` ......Does this mean that, at the instant the theory was denied, the sun stopped moving and the Earth started revolving around the Sun?"`
`"......Of course not.`
` The truth doesn't change based on what {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s believe."`
`"It's the same with this case.`
` Your denying my truth amounts to the same thing."`
`Several scholars before Galileo proposed the heliocentric model.`
`{n}......However, it was hard to objectively prove it using the scientific techniques available at the time.`
`However, that didn't change the fact that it was the truth.`
`{n}"And yet it moves".`
`".........So, you're saying the truth is still the truth whether you can prove it or not...?"`
`"Correct.`
` In the future,`
` when the full truth finally becomes known,`
` people will look back and realize that I had already discovered it."`
`Apparently, Ange just couldn't stand Hachijo's attitude.`
`{n}She kept getting irritated, and every time, Amakusa would joke around until she settled down again.`
`However, there could be no mistake that Hachijo was a genius...`
`and had used her extraordinary intuition to form a most interesting perspective on the events that had occurred on that island...`
`That was why Ange had wanted to contact Itouikukuro and hear about her viewpoint.`
`Still, she really was lucky to have been granted this meeting.`
`Ange hadn't been absolutely sure that Itouikukuro was Hachijo Tohya,`
` she hadn't thought that the publishing company would really contact the author,`
` ......and most of all, she hadn't dreamed that the mysterious masked author would grant her an interview under such short notice.`
`The more she thought about it, the more she realized that the sum of the events leading to this meeting made for nothing short of a miracle.`
`......Yes.`
` A miracle.`
`......After all, in most cases, I don't get contacted by the publishing company at all and leave for Niijima the next day.`
`..................?`
`.........I left for Niijima, then I went on to Rokkenjima.`
`......Then I gave Onee‐chan...Sakutarou.`
`......Huh?`
`.........Why would I have Sakutarou.........?`
`..............................`
`My memory of the future...is all muddled...`
` My head......hurts...`
`Hachijo said something about showing Ange something good, rose from the sofa, and headed for the study desk.`
`When she turned her back, Amakusa asked Ange, who seemed to be troubled about something, if she was okay.`
`"......Hey, Amakusa.`
` ......How...long have I been here...?"`
`"Wha?`
` You've been acting weird for a while now.`
` What's going on?"`
`".........I can't remember how long I've been sitting here."`
`"Are you still sleepy?"`
`"That's not it.`
` ......I mean, I managed to get an appointment with Professor Ootsuki, but the publishing company never got back to me about Itouikukuro,`
` ......and in the end, I spent the whole of today unable to accomplish anything, I thought..."`
`"Huh?"`
`"Amakusa, ......I thought you went to go get that large black bag..."`
`That's right.`
` Just before we left for Niijima, Amakusa and I briefly parted ways.`
` ......He said something about getting a weapon from an acquaintance of his, and he went to go get that large black bag.`
`Wasn't that...`
`...today.........?`
`What......am I talking about......?`
`I mean,`
` ......didn't I go to Niijima,`
` ......meet Captain Kawabata,`
` ...and, inside the bed shop,`
` .........huh?`
` ............What...?`
`"......Is something wrong...?"`
`Did my confusion and uncertainty make me sigh out loud...?`
`Even though Hachijo's back was to me,`
` ......she slowly turned around......and smiled as though she had peered into my heart.`
`"N‐`
`......no, it's nothing."`
`Strange memories...ones that even I can't understand.`
`I tried to hide my confusion,`
` .........but for some reason, Hachijo had a strange glint in her eyes, ......as though she could read my mind.`
`"I have revived and killed your family several times within various forgeries.`
` ......Almost as a witch might."`
`"Reviving and killing them whenever you like.`
` .........Endlessly.`
` ...Sounds almost like {f:5:Beatrice}, doesn't it..."`
`"Yes, it does.`
` ......So, please follow the lead of all those people on the web,`
` and consider the possibility that I might be a witch."`
`She took a thickly‐packed, brown envelope out of a locked drawer.`
`It appeared to be filled to bursting with pages of printed‐out text.`
`......Perhaps this was a manuscript for one of her works.`
`And, the neat letters written with a fountain pen on the envelope...`
`...spelled out the word "Dawn".`
`There is no forgery by the name of Dawn.`
`{n}......Which...must mean......`
`......Ange could tell.`
` This was a new one.`
`{n}Hachijo's newest, unreleased forgery......`
`“Dawn of the Golden Witch”...`
`"For one such as I, who knows everything, everything is boring.`
` ......However, I don't dislike letting the ignorant read my works to see what kind of reaction they have.`
` ......And so, I want you to read it."`
`"......You want me to read your newest work, which you've created as the new Endless Witch?"`
`"Correct, child of man.`
` Whether you resent it or admire it, you can help me forget my illness for a time."`
`".....................`
` ......Let's put an end to this farce, shall we?`
` ...Who are you?`
` ......I don't remember ever meeting you like this."`
`Yes, I did try to contact Hachijo Tohya.`
`{n}However, in the end, I never got a chance to meet her.`
`In other words, all of this is a falsehood.`
`"Whose piece am I this time?`
` ......Sorry, but if you think you can tame Ushiromiya Ange so easily,`
` you're making a big mistake."`
`".........Pfft.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*.........`
` Yes, ...I hoped you'd be this interesting.`
` Eheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheheh..."`
`She finally couldn't hold it back and burst out laughing...`
`Gradually, the space around them seemed to fill with a strange purple mist...`
`The room itself seemed to twist and bend...`
`Her figure also twisted,`
` ......and, after transforming through something that couldn't be described, she took the form of just what she had called herself:`
` ......a witch.`
`"Splendid.`
` You did well to see through my trick..."`
`".........It seems I'm the type that witches just love to cling to.`
` .........All of you have that same condescending tone towards other people.`
` I figured you were a witch right away."`
`The novelist sitting on the sofa was nowhere to be seen.`
`{n}Even Ange's bodyguard, who was supposed to be around at times like this, was gone.`
`There was only a nonhuman figure relaxing in a large, ornate rocking chair.`
`"I find you to be truly interesting, child of man.`
` ......Your charming nature is the perfect thing to alleviate my boredom."`
`"Yeah, well, I don't see anything charming about this.`
` ......Why am I alive?`
` ......Wasn't I killed in a pretty nasty way for breaking the rule about revealing my name...?"`
`Well, ......I did doubt that those people would just let me go so easily.`
`......What kind of farce will I be forced to go along with this time?`
`I really don't care.`
` I'll just do whatever I can within the bounds of the role they give me...whatever I can to help Onii‐chan.`
`Of course, I understand.`
`......Even if he wins, he'll never come back to "me".`
`"Even so, ......I'll struggle on.`
` I'll make sure Onii‐chan comes back to the "me" of that day."`
`"No need to lose your temper.`
` I am not asking you to be a piece..."`
`"Then why did you summon me here?`
` Don't tell me you want me to read this new story or whatever it is you've written."`
`"That's it exactly.`
` ......I do not want you to be my piece.`
` I have always been a mere observer,`
` and I have no intention of sticking my neck into their game..."`
`".........I don't get it.`
` What is it you want from me?"`
`"Be an observer for me, an observer of the fragments {f:5:Beatrice} has woven."`
`"An observer...?`
` I don't really know what you mean, but no deal."`
`"In the past,`
` I observed the fragments through Battler's eyes.`
` ......However, now that he has succeeded the position of Game Master, he is not a suitable observer.`
` I am following this tale with true and earnest intentions.`
` It would be such a waste to observe it through the eyes of Battler as he is now, like reading a detective novel backwards..."`
`"......Onii‐chan is the Game Master??`
` What on Earth are you talking about?"`
`"Of course you don't know.`
` You want to know, don't you?`
` ......I too wish to know something.`
` What kind of tale will Battler weave now that he has taken the position of Game Master?`
` ...Furthermore, I wish to search for the truth Battler reached as part of my own mental journey.`
` .........My illness affects me gravely.`
` If I do not think, I cannot even keep my heart beating..."`
`".........So,`
` ...you want me to read your new picture book aloud to you...?"`
`"You might as well interpret it that way.`
` In exchange, you will also be able to take part in your own journey of the mind.`
` I do believe that even you have yet to reach the truth.`
` .........I think you want to continue,`
` ...on the journey to find that truth."`
`"I don't owe you anything."`
`"Don't push your luck.`
` I can be lenient at times, but that is not usually the case..."`
`"........................"`
`Ange hadn't yet reached the truth either.`
`Though she knew that the game was little more than a toy for the witches to play with, she wanted it to resume...so that she could follow the tale and close in on the "king" called truth......`
`"......I might follow the tale so that I can find the truth myself,`
` ......but I have no obligation to read it aloud until the end for your sake.`
` ...Understand?"`
`Ange was willing to read the story aloud, but she could quit any time if this witch made her mad.`
`She was, in effect, warning the witch not to annoy her...`
`"Of course.`
` ......You call it a picture book, but to me, it is the only medicine for a fatal illness.`
` I cannot take that medicine without you to assist me.`
` ......In other words, this is a mutually beneficial arrangement."`
`"......So, you're telling me to read you a book until you fall asleep.`
` And in exchange, you'll let me read it too.`
` ......Is that right?"`
`"Precisely.`
` ......If you are willing to accept,`
` I shall ask that you become my Reader for a time."`
`"Well, it's nice to get my own title, but all you really want me to do is read books, right?"`
`"Becoming my Reader means the same as becoming my familiar.`
` ......In other words, what is done against you will be done against me.`
` I will not permit anyone to disrupt my only interest, that being to read the rest of {f:5:Beatrice}'s tale.`
` ......I will not let {f:5:Bernkastel}, {f:5:Lambdadelta},`
` or even {f:5:Beatrice} force anything upon you..."`
`This witch, who seemed to have an almost divine quality to her, spoke both quietly and forcefully...`
`There was no threat in her words.`
`......However, even so,`
` it was clear that she was on a different level than {f:5:Bernkastel} and the other witches, and not at all to be taken lightly.`
`"So, you'll offer me protection if I agree to read your book...?"`
`"Of course.`
` What I want is for you to read aloud to me.`
` ......I will not spare any who attempt to stand in the way of that."`
`"..........................."`
`"......If my attitude seems arrogant to you, allow me to apologize, child of man.`
` It may not seem so, but I am speaking to you with the utmost respect."`
`"Yeah, probably.`
` ......I get the feeling that even that witch‐like style of speech...`
`is the most respect you've shown anyone in the last few centuries."`
`"When you're reading a book, do you tell it "thank you very much" before flipping through the pages...?"`
`"......I guess it is like that.`
` I understand."`
`Just by agreeing to have a conversation with Ange, she was showing an incredible amount of respect and willingness to compromise.`
`Ange shrugged, but she also nodded to show her consent.`
`"Sure.`
` ......I'll be your Reader.`
` I see that you showed a ton of respect just by asking for my consent first."`
`"You understand well, child of man."`
`"......My name's Ange.`
` Not child of man or whatever."`
`"Heheheheheh.`
` ......Very well.`
` As proof of my respect for you, I will acknowledge your name."`
`For her, acknowledging a human's name was like acknowledging the names of all the leaves scattered across the ground.`
`So, .........her acknowledging Ange's name was a miracle.`
`{n}No, it was immensely good fortune.`
`"...From this point forth, Ushiromiya Ange...`
`will serve as Reader and {c:86EF9C:miko} to the Witch of Theatergoing, {f:5:Featherine Augustus Aurora}.`
` Until you finish reading,`
` I shall bring calamity to all who attempt to hinder your task."`
`When the Witch of Theatergoing, {f:5:Featherine}, spoke this, ......Ange was wrapped in a bright light.`
`Ange didn't feel any particular change herself,`
` ......but she definitely had been given something that only nonhumans could sense.`
`It signified that from this point forward, Ange would be attached to the Witch of Theatergoing.`
`That didn't mean that Ange would gain some sort of special power,`
` ......but at the very least, it probably meant that anyone wanting to cause her harm would first have to take on {f:5:Featherine} herself...`
`"......Your name is pretty long.`
` Sounds like some ancient Roman person.`
` ......What should I call you?"`
`"Those not familiar with me call me {f:5:Augustus Aurora}."`
`".........After all the respect you've shown me, it's only fitting that I respond in kind.`
` I'll call you {f:5:Featherine}.`
` Any problems?"`
`"None at all.`
` ......For an ailing witch such as myself, even being called by my first name will be an experience to be treasured and pondered over. Child of man."`
`"I have a name. It's Ange."`
`"......Heheh. Even conversations like this are nice every once in a while.`
` ......Ange, my miko."`
`Ange accepted her role.`
`{n}She would observe this tale with the Witch of Theatergoing.`
`The curtain was rising on the sixth tale......`
