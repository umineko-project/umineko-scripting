`"......Back then I was, and I guess I still am, a bit of a klutz...`
` I'd always forget where I'd put things...`
`or intend to lock something but then forget......I caused a lot of trouble."`
`"Hahaha, I remember how Aunt Natsuhi used to get mad at you all the time."`
`"But eventually, Shannon managed to overcome her forgetfulness."`
`"Oh, and how'd you do that?"`
`"......Heheh.`
` It wasn't anything big, ......but I got into the habit of writing things down.`
` I'd write down wherever I put something important.`
` ......For things that were part of the daily routine, I made a checklist and always made sure to check it......"`
`"So?`
` Did you see {f:5:Beatrice} or didn't you?"`
`"Oh, umm,`
` ......I didn't see her directly,`
` ......but, umm,`
` ......some very strange things did happen..."`
`She was talking about a certain summer night.`
`It was when Shannon was doing the nightly rounds......`
`{n}From her perspective, it was a ghost story.`
`From the witch's perspective, ......it was just the story of a little summer's night prank...`
`"My little sister.`
` Do you understand the anti‐magic toxin that {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s possess?"`
`"N‐no.`
` What is that, Onee‐sama?"`
`"Hmm.`
` The time of witches has long since passed.`
` ......Those vile {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s who claim to control everything came to deny our existence and possess a strong toxin."`
`"Is that toxin harmful to us...?"`
`"It is extremely dangerous.`
` If it got to us, our forms would probably evaporate in an instant.`
` However, one thing we do have in our favor is the fact that our existence is still extremely weak.`
` Because of that, the toxin does not affect us greatly.`
` At worst, it can only transform us into mist for a time."`
`"However, we'd rather avoid it if we can, right?"`
`"Correct.`
` Yes, I see that you are me.`
` You understand quickly."`
`The older sister appeared to be haughty at first,`
` .........but, perhaps because she was so happy to have met her double and little sister, she was more than willing to teach her anything she wanted to know.`
`The first thing she had taught her was that they were witches,`
` a different type of being than {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.`
`Beato had thought that she wasn't a witch because she couldn't use magic,`
` but apparently, she was still a witch nonetheless.`
`Then she was taught that witches such as her, unlike {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, were bound by various restrictions.`
`The greatest of those restrictions was the anti‐magic toxin possessed by {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.`
`"So, in other words, we mustn't enter a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}'s field of vision..."`
`"Correct.`
` You can think of it as though {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} eyes radiate the toxin.`
` If they see you, it is the same as your body being burnt.`
` Though they are lesser in extent, being heard or sensed can also result in contact with the toxin."`
`"......So, it's dangerous just for us to get close to {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s..."`
`Wasn't Father a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}...?`
`{n}Why am I not burnt by Father's toxin......?`
`"If we stock up magical power and have it acknowledged by {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, that toxin can be reduced drastically.`
` In other words, by having our existence acknowledged by {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, we make them lose their toxin,`
` making it possible for us to appear before them once more."`
`"I see......`
` Simply put, as we are now, we can only exist when {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s aren't around..."`
`"We are still very lacking in magical power,`
` which makes us inferior to even a stray cat hiding from {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s in the shadows."`
`The main goal of the older sister was to gain a large supply of magical power and be revived as a Great Witch strong enough to have no fear of the anti‐magic toxin.`
`For that purpose, she had wandered around the mansion night after night,`
` striving to regain her magical power and reduce the anti‐magic power of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s...`
`The powerful previous {f:5:Beatrice}, whom she had read about in {f:5:Featherine}'s library,`
` had appeared openly in front of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s and had even toyed with them at will.`
`......According to her big sister, such a level of power was most impressive.`
`"To think that a witch could appear openly before humans and use magic at will!`
` ......A witch like that would be so great that even I can hardly imagine it.`
` Is that what we will eventually become?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......She was like a witch from a picture book, appearing openly before the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s of the mansion and summoning magic and underlings at will..."`
`"Hmmm, how inspiring.`
` If that is our future, it means that all of our hard work will be worth it."`
`"Yes, it will.`
` ......Anyway, Onee‐sama.`
` What does going around unlocking windows like this have to do with the hard work you're talking about...?"`
`It was the middle of the night.`
` They were following behind servants who were checking the locks on the doors and windows and undoing those locks after the servants thought they had locked them.`
`......It felt more like a child's prank than the work of a witch...`
`"Heheheh, this is the path that leads to becoming a Great Witch.`
` All journeys begin with a single step.`
` To those who cannot understand, that first step may look quite foolish from time to time.`
` However, it is still a momentous first step...!"`
`With pride, as though making the first step for mankind on the surface of the moon,`
` the older sister undid the lock on a window with a click.`
`"Do you not understand, my little sister?`
` Can you not see what makes something like this momentous?"`
`"............?`
` No, Onee‐sama.`
` ......I don't really understand."`
`The older sister closed her eyes lightly, smiled, and opened the unlocked window a crack.`
`Cool outside air flowed in, making the curtains flutter.`
`"Let us put it in the toxin‐filled words of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` ......We are not supposed to exist on this island.`
` I shall go further.`
` "Right now, there is no one in this corridor".`
` And yet, the lock has been undone, ......and the window has opened.`
` ......Can you see how great a miracle, a work of magic, ......a proof of our existence that is?`
` Even you should understand the coolness of this breeze..."`
`"......I do understand.`
` It's nice and cool..."`
`"The coolness, the softness of the breeze.`
` ......And the feel of the fluttering curtain touching your hair.`
` ...All of these things show that we truly do exist here."`
`"So, ......by unlocking a window like this, we can leave behind proof that we really did exist."`
`"......And that is why I unlock them."`
`Of course, it wasn't just small pranks like opening a window.`
`......She could also smash windows and vases or leave behind strange fires and mysterious scribbles.`
`In fact, one time, she actually did play a large‐scale prank in the kitchen,`
` piling up kitchenware in an eerie manner and leaving behind a bizarre scribble, which scared the servants considerably.`
`It had been a complete success.`
`It had been truly terrifying, and she had succeeded in making the servants acknowledge the existence of magic, weakening the anti‐magic toxin...`
`However, she chose to make her presence known by unlocking windows.`
`By doing this, ......she could release herself from the restrictions imposed by the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s' toxin.`
`"One day,`
` I will—no, we will become a single witch and control all of Rokkenjima.`
` ......When that time comes, we will gain complete freedom and will be capable of stretching our wings as we please."`
`We won't have to be afraid of anyone's gaze anymore.`
`We'll be able to fly wherever we wish, disappear whenever we want.`
` Laugh however we like, prank however we like, talk with anyone we want to.`
`{y:0:Human}{n:0:Human}s might ask things of us from time to time.`
`{n}They might fight with us or play with us too.`
`What wonderful things for us frail creatures,`
` who cannot appear before anyone, to look forward to......`
`"......Right now, they are little more than pranks.`
` However, as they pile up, proof that we exist will begin to gather.`
` The servants already call me the witch {f:5:Beatrice}, master of the night,`
` and are beginning to believe in me bit by bit."`
`"The more they believe, the more those {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s will lose their anti‐magic toxin..."`
`......I see...`
` So, this means that Father has no anti‐magic toxin.`
`And.........that's because he truly believes in the existence of the witch I am, without any doubts.`
`I finally realized that, though I'd thought him to be cold, Father did possess a kindness that couldn't be seen......`
`"I'd like to become a great witch and appear in front of everyone soon."`
`"Mm.`
` Eventually, we will be able to appear openly in front of anyone.`
` By doing that repeatedly, we will make people believe in us, ...and eventually, we shall display even our magic for all to see.`
` ......After that happens, we will descend upon Rokkenjima as the Great Witch you told me of. Ahahahahaha!"`
`"......The logic of the witch side is very interesting.`
` It keeps me entertained."`
`"It does sound credible, in a way.`
` When {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s are warned that they're about to enter a famously haunted place, a hot spot for ghosts,`
` they're likely to start yelling "ghost, ghost!" at the drop of a hat."`
`"That's right.`
` All phenomena are fundamentally neutral, indifferent, and dull.`
` ......If one wishes to have them be accepted in a certain manner, they must first create a suitable environment..."`
`"If a person has charisma, people will interpret what they do in a positive way, even when they screw up.`
` ......I see.`
` I guess in that sense, the Beatos' small efforts aren't for nothing."`
`"If it were just the mansion's locks being undone, everything could be resolved by saying that someone forgot to lock up or that it was some kind of prank.`
` ......It is the rumors of a witch wandering about the mansion night after night that give form to the existence of the witch."`
`"An environment was established such that, if anything strange happened in the mansion at night, it would all be viewed as the work of the witch.`
` ......I get it. If things reached a point where no one questioned that logic,`
` it would mean the same thing as a witch existing in the mansion at night."`
`After the Beatos finished their mischief of unlocking and opening the window,`
` they enjoyed the coolness of the wind and the brightness of the moon, then became gold butterflies and disappeared into the darkness.`
`......There was no way of knowing whether the window they had opened had actually been opened by them.`
`The servants might have forgotten to lock up,`
` or one of the family might have opened it after the servants had locked up and forgotten to shut it again,`
` or maybe someone had played a prank.`
`In the same way that none of those possibilities could be denied,`
` ......it was also impossible to deny the possibility that a witch really had opened a window to enjoy the night breeze......`
`".........An outcome without an observer can possess an endless number of ways in which it might have occurred.`
` ...Those {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s who can only conceive of a single possibility are unable to imagine anything."`
`"However, people who believe in the possibility of a witch can imagine that it was a witch's prank.`
` ......When that happens, the scene of the {f:5:Beatrice}s' prank that we have just seen is etched into the fragment as a fact..."`
`"......That's one of the foundations of magic.`
` Decorating...the process."`
`With just a little magic, even a mass‐produced stuffed animal...`
`...can be reborn as a wonderful, unique stuffed animal filled with a mother's love.`
`If you doubt it, ......it will be burnt by the anti‐magic toxin.`
`{n}If you believe it, the magic will become the truth.`
`"..............................`
` ......Not all magic is bad.`
` ......Maria onee‐chan was right.`
` ......Good magic exists too."`
`"The power to repel evil magic may be necessary for a child of man.`
` However, it is part of the love of the human world not to burn away and defile love‐filled magic."`
`".....................`
` ......Well, good magic is the only kind I'm willing to allow.`
` ......For all other kinds, the best remedy is to deny them and burn them away."`
`"Heheheheheheheh...`
` A typical answer for a child of man."`
`"Getting back to the point.`
` ......What all this tells me...`
`is that the ghost {f:5:Beatrice}, who was called the ruler of Rokkenjima's night, doesn't really exist.`
` It's nothing more than a general term for any inexplicable occurrences that took place in the mansion at night.`
` In other words, {f:5:Beatrice} isn't the name of a person, it's the name of a phenomenon."`
`If anything bizarre happens, it all becomes the work of the Golden Witch...`
`Any environment in which "there could be a witch" {i:is}, in fact, {f:5:Beatrice} itself.`
`"......That all piles up until we reach 1986.`
` ......This is the veil that the true culprit is hiding behind.`
` And the person hiding behind it is, without a doubt, one of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s."`
`"Let us say that this holds true at this point in the witches' tale of the past.`
` ......However, I doubt you can use that argument alone to fight all the way through 1986......"`
`"..........................."`
`"Heheheheheheheheh......"`
`"Ridiculous.`
` Someone obviously must have forgotten to lock up."`
`"W‐......well, you may say that, but...umm...`
`b‐but this isn't just something that happened once or twice..."`
`"In other words, you're a klutz, a fool,`
` and a moron of a servant who forgot to check not just once or twice, but many times over?"`
`"......Shannon isn't the only one.`
` That same window was always opened even when other servants did the rounds."`
`"Yeah, Mom even asked me if I'd ever left a window open in the hall at night.`
` I had absolutely nothing to do with it, but she still got pissed.`
` Sheesh."`
`"I'm sure {f:5:Beatrice} wanted to gaze at the moon.`
` Uu."`
`"It is a bit creepy to have that happen over and over at the same window.`
` ......And that time where the kitchenware was piled up in the kitchen, with a creepy magic circle scribbled there...that sounds even more freaky."`
`"......Y‐yes.`
` They said it was an eerie magic circle drawn with something like blood......`
` Ever since then, people have been scared to patrol the kitchen..."`
`"About the case of the eerie magic circle in the kitchen.`
` Who witnessed that?"`
`"Well, ......uh, ......it wasn't me...`
` I, uh......think I heard about it from a servant kid who quit.`
` I wasn't on duty that day..."`
`"Then there you have it.`
` In the same way that stories about popular haunted locations become exaggerated, you servants like to have a little fun telling ghost stories about the mansion at night, don't you?`
` By doing that, you speak as though the witch exists and infect others with that belief."`
`"......So, all of the eerie things that were supposedly done by {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`are either the result of coincidence and accident, or completely cooked‐up stories that people fabricated for fun.`
` ...Is that what you're trying to say?"`
`"Exactly.`
` Of course there's no way {f:5:Beatrice} exists."`
`"Uu......`
` {f:5:Beatrice} exists."`
`"I'm glad you understand so well, Battler‐san.`
` ......I imagine there does exist some human person with that name, or else multiple specific or nonspecific people who acted under such an alias."`
`"However, this "Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}" that we hope and fantasize might exist...`
`is completely and unequivocally impossible."`
`"Uu!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} exists!`
` I've met her!!"`
`"Oh? Could you tell me about that in detail?`
` You met {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` And did she show you magic or something?"`
`"Uu!`
` I see her all the time!`
` Every time I come to Rokkenjima!`
` And she always shows me fun magic!!"`
`Denying the existence of the witch would always have the immediate effect of infuriating Maria.`
`However, Erika, who didn't know to avoid this topic, had challenged her head on.`
`But no matter how Maria tried to smooth over the matter of {f:5:Beatrice}'s existence, she stood no chance of defeating the ruthlessly intelligent Erika in an argument...`
`George and Jessica hurried to calm Maria down, but Maria's anger could not be settled by this point.`
`"<Good>!`
` So, she showed you magic?`
` Could you explain in detail what kind of magic?"`
`"She would always use magic to give me candy as a present!!`
` Beato can create candy with magic!!"`
`"Are you sure she didn't just take it out of her pocket?"`
`"No, she didn't!!`
` It was magic!`
` It was incredible!! Tons of candies poured out of an empty cup!"`
`"W‐wow, that's some awesome magic..."`
`"That's right, that really would be magic...!"`
`"Yeah, it was magic!!`
` It really was empty!!`
` I checked inside it myself!!"`
`"Excuse me?`
` What do you mean, you checked inside it?"`
`"G‐give it a rest, Erika‐san...`
` She's just a kid..."`
`"Anyway, Erika‐sama, ...would you like some more t—`
`kyah—"`
`"<No thank you>.`
` I'm having a seriously intellectual discussion over here.`
` You outsiders can stay out of this!"`
`"You'll have to tell me in more detail, Maria‐san.`
` What do you mean when you say that you checked inside it?`
` Fortunately, we have right here with us a tea cup that's just been overturned and emptied!`
` Will you do me the favor of recreating the circumstances for me right now?`
` Let's see it, if you would, let's see it!!"`
`After holding the cup of black tea, which she had just overturned and was still dripping, upside down over the table,`
` Erika slammed it down hard and slid it over to Maria.`
`Erika's eyes glowed repulsively, like those of a snake about to snap up a frog.`
`Those eyes were ice‐cold and had a madness in them that made one want to avert their gaze.`
`On the other hand, Maria was glaring furiously,`
` her whole body shaking uncontrollably, in the greatest expression of anger that a human can manage.`
`The look on her face was frightening...not at all something one would expect to see on a nine‐year‐old girl.`
`"S‐stop it, both of you...!"`
`"Uuu!!!`
` I'll show you what {f:5:Beatrice} did!!`
` Just like this!!`
` She took the empty cup!!`
` And she put it upside down on the table!!"`
`"Yes, and then?!`
` Did she then immediately lift it up and candies flowed out?!`
` Incredible, that really would be magic! ...{i:If it happened that way}!!!"`
`Battler and the others tried to get between the two and calm them down,`
` but it was no use.`
`The two violently pushed aside the others,`
` and, glaring at each other from so close that their foreheads banged together, they repeatedly slammed down the upside down cup on the table.`
`The sound of their foreheads banging together and the cup being slapped down...shattered the barrier between reality and illusion...!!`
`"It is magic, it is magic!!`
` Beato used magic to make candies appear!!"`
`"Then why don't you reproduce it for us?!!`
` Founder of Mariage Sorcière and Witch of Origins, {f:5:Maria{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa}!!"`
`"Lady {f:5:Erika}, this opponent is not worth your {f:5:time}.`
` This battle is not worth {f:5:fighting}..."`
`"Shut up, ball‐jointed murder doll!!`
` Alright!!`
` How do you claim that the overturned cup was filled with candies?!"`
`"Just turning the cup over won't make candies come out!!`
` Because you have to use magic to make them come out!!`
` Beato can use magic because she's a witch!!"`
`"Oh yes, magic, she used magic!!`
` How did she use magic?!`
` Did she swing a magic wand and tap the cup to make candies pour out?!`
` *giggle*, no, that can't be it, right? Right?!"`
`"Beato is a witch so she used magic!`
` Magic is when you say an incantation and cause a miracle!!`
` You can't use the magic that makes candy unless you say the incantation!!"`
`"Oh, sure, understood. <Good>, <good>, yes, <good>!!`
` Let's see this incantation, let's see this magic, come on, what kind of incantation would a witch use? What kind?!?!"`
`"Come, try to picture it!!`
` The inside of the cup is filled with candies!!`
` Try to picture such a wonder!"`
`"Ooooooooooh? And then whaaaaaaat?"`
`"Look, the inside of the cup...`
`...is filled with candy!!!"`
`Maria grasped the overturned cup so tightly that it nearly cracked,`
` ......and slowly...`
`......lifted it up...`
`Then, ......from the inside,`
` ......as many cute candies as the cup could hold poured out...!`
`Maria looked at Erika with a full smile, as though saying "that showed you".`
`"<Good>!!`
` Is this what you call {f:5:Beatrice}'s magic?!`
` Dlanoo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooor!!"`

`"........................`
` ......As you {f:5:wish}."`
`"I won't let anyone deny Beato's magic!!`
` After all, magic is magic!!"`
`"Magic is impossible.`
` {p:2:You might be telling a lie about something that never happened}!!"`
`"A repetition has been {f:5:requested}.`
` Failure to respond will be a violation of Knox's seventh {f:5:commandment}."`
`"Ahahaha, I'll respond! This is the truth!!`
` {p:1:This story really happened}!!"`
`"{p:2:This wouldn't have anything to do with a trick in the actual cup or table, making this just a sleight of hand, right}?`
` That would be against the rules, wouldn't it?!?!"`
`"Hidden devices and tricks are in violation of Knox's third {f:5:commandment}.`
` However, if and only if foreshadowing has been presented, these are permitted by Knox's eighth {f:5:commandment}."`
`Knox's third commandment prohibits hidden doors and devices that have no clues pointing towards them.`
`However, by presenting foreshadowing and clues that point towards the existence of said devices,`
` Knox's eighth commandment allows them to be used.`
`"{p:1:They had no tricks like that in them!!`
` It was just an ordinary table and an ordinary cup}!!`
` So it's magic, not a trick!!"`
`"......{f:5:Understood}.`
` ......By Knox's ninth commandment, Lady {f:5:Maria}'s account of witnessing magic is {f:5:permissible}."`
`"Ahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` That's right, with the ninth at least!!`
` Observers are always allowed to speak their personal opinions!"`
`"Otherwise, mysteries where the culprit is seen dressed up as a woman and it's written "I saw a woman" would all be disqualified!!`
` Sure, that's fine, claim that you saw magic all you want!!"`
`"All truths are nothing more than claims!`
` So, I'll make a claim separate from yours and smash right through yours!!`
` That is the detective's duty, and the time we shine the mooooooost!!"`
`"You can't break through this, this is magic!!!"`
`"Since it is magic, only witches can use it, right?"`
`"That's right, only witches can use it!!"`
`"...So, if a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} like me could use it too,`
` that would mean it isn't magic, right?"`
`"You can't use it!!!`
` Only Beato can use magic!!"`
`"<Good>!!`
` Then why don't I show you?!!`
` I'll make candy appear from out of this empty cup!!"`
`"I'd like to see you try!!`
` Impossible, impossible, useless, useless! There's no way a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} can do it!!"`
`"Then please, please, please just relax and watch!!`
` Okay, here we have an empty cup.`
` Is that okay? It is, isn't it?`
` Then we turn it over on the table like this!!"`
`"......Let it be known that this fight has no point..."`
`"....................."`
`"Okay, I'm going to say the incantation for creating candies now...`
` In fact, why don't we say it together?`
` Come, try to picture it!!"`
`"The inside of the cup is filled with candy!!`
` Try to picture such a wonder!!"`
`"<STOP>!!`
` Maria‐san.`
` Why do you close your eyes when you say the incantation?`
` Why not witness the miracle of magic?"`
`"Humans are stained by the anti‐magic toxin!!`
` If a lowly {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} saw it, the miracle of magic would be wiped out of existence!!`
` That's why there's a rule that says lowly {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s have to close their eyes when using magic!!"`
`"I see, I see. Okay, I understand the protocol used by {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s performing magic!!`
` In other words, not once have you ever witnessed the moment the magic happened! Isn't that right?!"`
`"Look, it's done!`
` Please, lift up the cup...!`
` After all, I've used the magic to make candies appear."`
`"There's no way someone who makes fun of witches could use the candy magic...!"`
`"Then if it actually did work, all the better."`
`After glaring at Erika with the utmost of malice,`
` ......Maria slowly stretched her hand out towards the overturned cup...`
`......There was no way that Erika, someone who made fun of witches like this, could ever use magic.`
`There was no way that there'd be candy there...`
`"..............................So, how's it look inside?"`
`".....................`
` ...............Ah—"`
`......And there........in a cute wrapper......lay a single...candy......`
`".........See?"`
`".................."`
`"......This is magic, right?"`
`Erika smiled gently......`
`A look of disbelieving shock rose in Maria's eyes...`
`...along with envy for this person who could use the same magic as Beato...`
`"Erika...`
`......you can...use magic too...?"`
`"See? It's magic, isn't it?`
` What I did there."`
`"Y‐...............yeah!!"`
`"So, in other words—"`
`Erika smiled pleasantly.`
` ......She and Maria had finally reached a deep understanding...`
`"You're a MOROOOOOOOOOOOOON!!!`
`"`
`"{p:2:While you had your eyes closed, I just lifted the cup up and tossed a candy in!!`
` Call that magic?`
` It's just a third‐rate triiiiiick, hyah{0}ha{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aah}!!!"`
`"There's my blue truth as the detective.`
` And now, as the Witch of Truth, I present to you: my red truu{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}uuth!!!"`
`"{p:1:Your so‐called candy magic is nothing more than sleight of hand!!}`

`"......Huuuh?!"`
`"{p:2:P‐putting the candy in this cup might have been your sleight of hand,`

`"......For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following."`

`"You damn scraps of paper!!`
` Why'd you have to butt in at the good part...?!!"`
`"That is {f:5:enough}.`
` Lady {f:5:Maria} has been shown that the magic which makes candy appear in a cup could possibly be a trick that she misunderstood to be {f:5:magic}.`
` Therefore, her claim that it was magic is {f:5:dismissed}."`
`"{p:2:However, it might really have been magic when Maria saw it...!`
` Just because it can be done by a sleight of hand doesn't disprove magic}."`
`"......Well done, Lady {f:5:Erika}.`
` Congratulations on crushing Lady {f:5:Maria}'s witch {f:5:illusion}."`
`Witch illusions are an attempt to make others acknowledge the existence of magic by claiming that something would be impossible without it. That is the attack used by witches.`
`If someone can argue back and say that it would be possible without magic, the witch illusion is defeated, and the witch must retreat.`
`The magic that Maria claimed to have seen had the possibility of being a trick, so it was unqualified to be acknowledged as magic.`
`That was only the result of this battle.`
` It was still too early to bring the fight into the domain of denying everything else Maria believed in: the existence of {f:5:Beatrice}, witches, and magic......`
`However, battles will always end instantly when your opponent surrenders.`
`Erika had wanted to hit Maria with everything at once, defiling the witch and magic she believed in,`
` and crushing it without a fragment of compassion...`
`"........................`
` ......Tch!!`
` Just one more step and I'd have been able to take a heart as pure as the smooth sand just after a wave has pulled back...and tear it to bits.`
` .........What a shame.`
` This isn't any fun anymore.`
` ...............Are you satisfied now?!`
` Ouch, ...owowowow......"`
`Erika grumpily punched the arm of Dlanor's that was restraining her.`
` However, that cold, hard, marble‐like arm just made Erika's hand hurt.`
`".........D‐diplomatic immunity...!`
` This battle is over...!"`
`"For your attention:`
` diplomatic immunity accepted."`
`"......Know that this fight is childish in the extreme."`
`"Did you say something?!"`
`"She did {f:5:not}.`
` ......Let us {f:5:withdraw}.`
` Lady {f:5:Maria} is no match for you, Lady {f:5:Erika}.`
` There is no need to pay any attention to small fry such as {f:5:this}."`
`"............Hmph.`
` ......You're right.`
` How childish of me, tearing a kid's dreams apart.`
` I'm really sorry, okay?`
` I apologize for my momentary lack of elegance.`
` *giggle*giggle*.`
` Let's go."`
`Erika's group turned their backs on Maria, who was still crouching down limply.`
`However,`
` ......as detectives in famous mysteries have always done in the past,`
` Erika clapped her hands, stopped, and turned around.`
`"Oh, that's right.`
` ......Your thoughts...?"`
`"............?"`
`"All it takes is the presence of an overturned cup,`
` and a deduction like this becomes trivial for Furudo Erika.`
` .........Your thoughts, ladies and gentlemen?"`
`"...............!!!"`
`Erika's merciless words gouged themselves into Maria's heart once more......`
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*,`
` ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}haa{0}haha!!!`
`Erika left, leaving an evil laugh behind her.`
`After bowing to Maria and Sakutarou, Dlanor left too.`
`......Gertrude and Cornelia followed suit...`
`After that, only Maria and Sakutarou were left in the lonely Golden Land......`
`"............Uryuu......"`
`"......Beato......is a witch......"`
`"Uryu...`
` Beato is a witch..."`
`"It was magic......`
`......*hic*...`
`...it was magic......"`
`"It was magic... Beato used magic to give you candy...`
` You don't need to doubt that...`
` ......Uryuu...!`
` Please believe in Beato...`
` You know that magic can't bear fruit unless you believe..."`
`"Uuuuu......uuuuuuuuuuwaaaaaaaaahhhh......"`
`In the middle of an ice‐cold drizzle, which had started falling at some point,`
` ......Maria sobbed...`
`Trying to at least protect her from the rain, Sakutarou used his large sleeves to cover Maria's head...`
`...and stayed there by her side......`
`"Okay, let's go, Maria...!`
` Let's play cards together in the room upstairs..."`
`"......Erika‐san.`
` As an adult, I cannot condone that conversation just now."`
`"My apologies.`
` I'm still just a kid, after all."`
`"......*hic*, .........*hic*......"`
`After seeing that wonderful candy magic brutally insulted by Erika,`
` ......Maria had been crying this whole time...`
`"Haah...`
` ......I started noticing it at the quiz party after dinner,`
` but your personality is screwed up.`
` ......Is this fun for you?!`
` Are you enjoying tearing a little kid's dreams apart?"`
`"P‐please stop, Battler‐sama...!`
` Please, for my sake, don't push any further here...!`
` Please...!"`
`Shannon, who had been looking flustered, bowed her head deeply and implored Battler to stop.`
`{n}George, who didn't want Shannon pressured, fell in line.`
`"Let's go.`
` Let's spend this year in the cousins' room too.`
` We can watch TV and play cards."`
`"......I've heard that Erika‐san has her own room.`
` Shannon, please guide her."`
`"Oh, no need to bother yet.`
` I'll relax down here for a little while longer.`
` I want to savor it a bit."`
`"......What the hell are you trying to savor...`
` ...Pft."`
`Battler and the others could no longer hide their irritation.`
`They had no obligation to entertain their uninvited guest any further than this.`
`Erika herself understood perfectly well that no place would welcome a detective.`
`Battler and the others wanted to leave, and Erika wanted to stay.`
`{n}Neither had any desire to stop the other.`
`Jessica urged Maria, who was still crying, to come along...`
`Then, Maria stopped and spun around.`
`".........Got a problem?"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi{0}hi!!`
` They do exist here and there...{y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s that are practically lumps of the toxin that doesn't believe in magic!`
` There are many boys like you in my class!"`
`"They don't believe in witches, or magic, or miracles, or happiness!`
` You can't become a witch if you let the toxin of people like that burn you to ashes!`
` I may not look it, but I'm {f:5:Beatrice}'s disciple!`
` I'm the Apprentice Witch of Origins!`
` Kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!!!"`
`Maria, who had been sobbing until a second ago, seemed to have transformed into an entirely different person.`
` ......She laughed...no, cackled eerily.`
`Battler's group stiffened up at this sudden change, but Erika was watching calmly.`
`Then, she smiled and gave a small nod in response.`
`"<Good>.`
` ......You're not a bad opponent.`
` Good night, Miss {f:5:Maria}.`
` Let's fight in a more satisfying game next time."`
`"Sure. Let's. It's a promise.`
` .......Kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi."`
`"Y‐you stop that too, Maria...!`
` Come on, let's go."`
`"What about you, Shannon‐chan?`
` You can play cards with us, if you want."`
`"Come on, join us for at least one round.`
` It'll cheer you up."`
`"Uh, ......ah...th‐then, just for a bit......"`
`Shannon couldn't remain in this suffocating lounge any longer either.`
`In part apologetic and in part trying to escape, she followed after Battler's group...`
`After that, Erika was the only one left in the lounge...`
`Still wearing a thin smile, she tapped a glass with her finger.`
`There was a light chink.`
` ......A surprisingly boring sound.`
`Even so, Erika wore a thin smile, as though pleased...`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, sorry to keep you waiting.`
` I was just in the bath...`
` ......Oh, where is everyone?"`
`"......You just missed them.`
` They went upstairs.`
` I'm the one who called you here.`
` ......I've heard that you know a lot of stories about Akujikijima and the witch of the forest."`
`"Yes, well.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` They are trivial stories, but..."`
`"I don't mind in the slightest if they're trivial.`
` Would you like a drink to follow your bath?"`
`"......Even I like to be helpful every now and then."`
`Erika stood up, opened the refrigerator behind the counter, and put ice into the ice pail......`
