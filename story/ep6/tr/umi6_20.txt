`"............Lambda, ......where are you......?"`
`Just having to say that felt like admitting defeat......and I didn't like it.`
`Why is it that she's always so obnoxious and clingy when I don't need her,`
` ......and then won't answer when I call her name?`
`Where.........am I......?`
`Annoyed by the completely predictable ending, I had left the cathedral.`
`......I had planned on finding some terrace with a cool night's breeze...`
`where I could kill time until the end of that farcical reception.`
`"......It's true that I tried to find somewhere desolate so that I didn't have to look at people,`
` .........but this is a bit ridiculous."`
`I, the great {f:5:Bernkastel}, ......am lost?`
`A miracle like that certainly couldn't happen.`
`Yes...miracles don't exist in this world.`
`To create a miracle, you need "an amount of time that can never be reached", a period that is no different from infinity.`
`So, when something that appears to be a miracle happens in a shorter span of time than that,`
` .....it is not a miracle...`
`but due to someone's......design.`
`In other words, ......the reason I'm walking down this bizarre corridor...`
`...is because someone's design has forced me here......`
`".........Who did this?`
` Who pulled this elaborate prank on me?`
` .........You must be quite the shy one,`
` ......calling me out to a desolate place like this."`
`......Then, ......from the other end of the dark corridor, ......I heard a sound.`
`{a:c:*patter*, *patter*patter*patter*.........}`
`It sounded as though some small animal, like a dog or a cat, was walking at a quick pace.`
`No miracle could cause a dog or cat to be in a place like this.`
`{n}Such a miracle would not be "allowed".`
`Since it isn't a miracle,`
` that means I am being guided in that direction.`
`.........Alright then.`
` This might be some new idea to keep me entertained.`
`If this is some new joke of Lambda's, I'll cover her whole body with honey using my tongue as a reward.`
`...And then, I'll stick parasol chocolates into her eyes and tell her to never do it again.`
`In the direction that the noise had come from, ......it was not only dim, but shrouded in complete darkness.`
`However, ......I could sense something in that darkness.`
`.........There were two emerald‐green glints, ......probably cat eyes.`
` The eyes of a black cat that blended well into the darkness.`
`"Are you the one who called me here...?`
` .........Or......are you just the messenger...? ..............."`
`When I looked at my feet, ......I saw red cat footprints leading towards those cat eyes.`
`......It was unsettling, ...as though it had run through a puddle of blood on its way there.`
`After my eyes adjusted to the darkness, .........even with the lack of light, I was vaguely able to make out the red footprints ahead of me.`
`......They weren't actually glowing or anything,`
` ......but they served perfectly well as a signpost leading me onwards.`
`{a:c:*patter*patter*patter*patter*......}`
`As though it was telling me to follow,`
` ......the cat turned around and dashed off into the darkness.`
`..................What is it?`
` ......Something feels...very strange.`
`It's a feeling I haven't felt since I began calling myself the cruelest witch in the world.`
`......I can't quite remember what this feeling is.`
`Still, ......for one as tired of boredom as me, it's surely more fun this way.`
`I followed the bloody footprints of the cat, which would sometimes stop and look back at me,`
` ............and walked on and on through the dark corridor......`
`It headed forward, .........turned corners,`
` .........and descended what appeared to be stairs from time to time.`
`And then, ......though I couldn't really tell because of the darkness, .........it slipped through the crack of a door.`
`"........................Here......?"`
`I pushed the door open slowly, ......but it was dark on the inside, just like the corridor.`
`However, the air and the slight change in the echoes made by the footsteps...`
`told me that this was a room, not a corridor.`
`The sounds of the cat's footsteps were gone.`
`......However, the bloody footprints remained.`
`On the other side of some sort of wooden screen, ......under what looked like a small spotlight...`
`......that same black cat...`
`was noisily gobbling down a bowl of pet food.`
`.........I see.`
` So, this is its reward for bringing me here...`
`"Cat......`
` Sorry to bother you during your meal,`
` ......but I'd like you to summon your master.`
` .........That is, unless you're actually the one who summoned me...?"`
`Talking to it didn't cause it to turn around.`
`......Well, I guess it is an animal eating its food.`
` ......If I kick it away, it'll probably run off to its owner.`
`".........Hmph."`
`When I did kick the cat,`
` ......it sailed away like a stuffed animal,`
` hit the wall, and fell to the ground.`
`Then, it vanished, as though it had melted into the darkness......`
`......What's with this cat?`
` ......Is it just an illusion...?`
`"........................!"`
`When I looked at its food bowl, ......it was piled up with what appeared to be blood‐drenched raw meat.`
`......It was as though someone had torn apart living flesh on the spot...`
`...and piled it into there.`
`".........Come on, what's with the creepy reception?"`
`{a:c:`
`{m:-5:―}―That was a mean thing to do, kicking it}.`
`The instant I heard that voice, the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end.`
`Then, ......the surrounding area finally brightened.....`
`However, {f:5:Bernkastel} had already guessed where this was before it grew bright...`
`".........That was you.`
` ......That cat."`
`"......................................."`
`"......My dear flesh‐eating cat who has learned to choose its own path,`
` ......it has been long since we last met......"`
`"It's a path I'd never have to have noticed if you hadn't told me.`
` ......You're the monster who taught me the taste of flesh.`
` .........So, you've come back to life.`
` .........{f:5:Featherine Auaurora}..."`
`"......It is {f:5:Augustus Aurora}......`
` You never learn no matter how often I tell you that...`
` ...Very well.`
` Even that brings back fond memories......`
` I have heard the rumors...`
` .........It seems you have taken the name {f:5:Bernkastel}, Witch of Miracles, .........and have been traveling around playing some far from praiseworthy fragment games......"`
`"I'm just imitating you.`
` Though I could hardly match up to your level.`
` ......If the rumors you've heard about me are bad, that applies a hundredfold to you."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} sat unreservedly in an antique chair,`
` ......as though she was already familiar with the place.`
`"............What are you afraid of?`
` I am merely celebrating my reunion with my longest‐serving miko so far...`
` Did you really find my messenger cat so displeasing?"`
`By all appearances, {f:5:Bernkastel}'s manner seemed relaxed...`
`However, {f:5:Featherine} admonished her, telling her not to be afraid.`
`......And, judging by the expression that rose to Bern's face,`
` ......{f:5:Featherine} had been right on the mark...`
`"Did you really have to make such blunt insinuations against me?`
` ......A cat leaving behind bloody footprints and stuffing its face with blood‐stained meat..."`
`"...........................`
` ......Have no fear.`
` ......Look closely.`
` ......Where do you see a cat stuffing its face with blood‐stained meat......?`
` I just gave it a plate of biscuits as a reward for going to get you..."`
`"..........................."`
`............Despite there being no wind, the bowl at her feet seemed to blow away as though it was made of soot.`
`...In its place lay a lovely......and perfectly normal......cat dish,`
` .........with a pile of small biscuits on top of it...`
`".....................Tch......"`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} didn't even hide her displeased grimace.`
`{f:5:Featherine} shrugged and muttered "you haven't changed, child of man" as she rocked her rocking chair.`
`".........I see you're as unpleasant as ever.`
` ......But nowadays I find you pleasing.`
` Imitating you really has been far from boring."`
`"......Scold me as you please.`
` It is the parting gift I gave you when we last met."`
`"You liked abusive mikos because they kept you entertained, right......?`
` Tch, ridiculous.`
` ......If talking will only please you, I'll shut up.`
` .........So, ......what do you want with me...?"`
`"It seems {f:5:Beatrice}'s game has ended with Battler's victory.`
` ......I observed it.`
` It was quite entertaining."`
`".........I'm sure you enjoyed seeing me fail miserably."`
`"Nonsense, it was a splendid performance...`
` ............I'm sure Beato is very grateful to you."`
`"............Hmph.`
` ......And?`
` If you want me to read the fragments of Beato's game aloud for you, I refuse.`
` I'm not your miko anymore."`
`"I have observed all of Beato's games.`
` ......I also watched {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s game and Battler's game with great interest.`
` ......I believe I have fashioned my own particular answers to all the mysteries.`
` .........The culprit.`
` The motive.`
` The individual tricks.`
` ......I am not yet clear about the very last part of the epitaph's riddle,`
` but I have enough of a theory that if I actually went to Rokkenjima and investigated, I should be able to resolve that part as well."`
`"...............And...?"`
`"Of course, since there is no single truth, my theory is probably only one of many possibilities.`
` ......However, it is one of those possibilities, so that problem is a trivial one."`
`"......What are you up to?`
` .........Do you want to debate Beato's game with me?"`
`"Wrong.`
` .........What I want is to look at the answers, child of man."`
`Those words of {f:5:Featherine}'s made {f:5:Bernkastel} straighten up.`
`......Her old master did not fail to notice that small reaction.`
`"So far, you have spiced up this tale as an actor.`
` In doing that, you have probably come to know many truths.`
` ......However, even you are unaware of the truth behind several mysteries that Beato has skillfully kept hidden, correct......?"`
`"...........................`
` .........I see...`
` .........You want to use me......to chew apart......and string out the guts of something again."`
`"After watching a play, the experience of reading the pamphlet and learning what goes on behind the scenes...`
`...is similar to, as you would say it, enjoying some black tea after a meal.`
` ......It is ceremony, but essential nonetheless."`
`"You play with them and love them while they're alive, then eat their flesh when they die.`
` ......So, cats are doubly useful to you.`
` .........Just die, monster."`
`"I want...to look at the answers.`
` .........I'm sure you want to know them."`
`"...................................."`
`"Think of it as a burial for Beato's corpse, where you are in charge of the service.`
` ......What do you say about that, child of man?"`
`".........Now, you're starting to speak my language."`
`When {f:5:Featherine} snapped her fingers,`
` a thin spotlight shone on a table cluttered with books.`
`There.........lay a folded version of the game board for Beato's game.`
`The Witch of Theatergoing spun her finger in a circle, and the game board opened up by itself,`
` revealing the rows of black and white pieces that were packed away inside it.`
`".........It is a complete set, containing the game board and all the pieces.`
` ......The records of the previous games are all there as well."`
`With a rustling sound, the books flipped through all their pages of their own accord, shut themselves,`
` and flew to the side of the game board, where they waited.`
` Inside them, all of the movements of the pieces during previous games were recorded...`
`".........I see.`
` So you were short a player and a commentator..."`
`"We are also short on black tea.`
` ......And, I suppose, dried plums.`
` Of course, I will find some."`
`"..............................`
` ......Okay.`
` If you add on some mustard rice cakes, then we have a deal."`
`"The negotiations are concluded."`
`"I have one condition."`
`"Oh, and what is that?"`
`"I'm going to be the Reader, right...?`
` .........I have no love, so I might interpret all kinds of things in strange ways.`
` ......However, the Reader is free to read things in a manner and with an intonation of her choosing."`
`"I only want to check the answers.`
` ......I have no interest in the tale itself.`
` .........The particular kind of tale you choose to create is of no interest to me whatsoever.`
` ............Ah, yes.`
` Now I see what you're after."`
`"..................Will you accept that condition?"`
`"Very well...`
` I want to know the answers. You want an outlet for your grievances.`
` The negotiations are concluded."`
`When {f:5:Featherine} snapped her fingers once more,`
` ......a large chair appeared, as though beckoning {f:5:Bernkastel} to sit there.`
`The chair, its design horribly mismatched with the furnishings of this room, ......was a throne.`
`Wait, I've seen this before.`
` .........This is—`
`"I acknowledge it. You may sit.`
` You are the Game Master."`
`".........Are you sure?`
` ......Are you {i:really} sure...?"`
`"You may create whatever sort of tale you like to ease your inner hatred.`
` I am not interested.`
` However, I have one condition as well.`
` ......Provide all of the answers I seek.`
` No hiding, concealment, or tricks."`
`"Heh, ......heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh...!`
` Leave it to me.`
` Tearing apart the chest and ripping out the guts is my specialty.`
` .........After all, you trained me."`
`"I shall make you some black tea.`
` ......With my own hands, not magic.`
` ......Let the master treat her miko to some tea..."`
`"Beato once told me that tea is best drunk in the company of a witch."`
`"It seems we differ in that regard......`
` ......Heh, ...heheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh."`
`......At some point, that dish piled with biscuits...`
`...had reverted to a mountain of torn‐apart meat and a splatter of red.`
` No, not just meat, ...even intestines...`
`"......Tea is best enjoyed—"`
`""With your fellow monsters.""`
`".........In that case, let's get the pieces ready.`
` If we keep counting, this'll be game number seven, right?"`
`"Correct.`
` An auspicious number."`
`"It won't be for Beato."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} slowly picked up a black piece.`
`It was the piece that represented {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`It was sometimes a king, sometimes a queen, and could even become a knight.`
`However, that was only if it got promoted.`
`{n}Until then, it was only a trash piece, like a pawn.`
`First came piece positioning.`
` Even this early, the witch's game had already begun.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} took Beato's piece and slowly raised it high.`
`"First move, placement.`
` {f:5:Beatrice} on d8."`
