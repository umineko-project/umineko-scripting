stralias grim_8_1_1,":s;#FFFFFF`{p:5:{p:4:あっち向いてホイ} ({i:Acchi Muite Hoi}) is a popular Japanese variant of Rock-Paper-Scissors.{n}{n}In Acchi Muite Hoi, whoever throws the winning hand sign is not immediately declared the winner, but rather earns the {i:opportunity} to win, while the other player must try to avoid losing. The player with “advantage” says “acchi muite” (“look that way”), and then, in time with a call of “hoi!”, he or she points one finger either up, down, left, or right. At the same time, the other player turns their head, also in one of those four directions. If the player with advantage correctly predicts which way the other will turn, they win. Otherwise, the process returns to the beginning with another round of Rock-Paper-Scissors.}"
stralias grim_8_2_1,":s;#FFFFFF`{p:5:{p:4:桃太郎} ({i:Momotarou}) or “Peach Boy” is a Japanese fairy tale named after its main character, Momotarou.{n}{n}The full story is a little too long to tell properly here, but it should suffice to explain that it is about a boy who was born from a giant peach which came floating down a river.}"

Therefore, the very act of dispatching her is equivalent to a death sentence.{n}{n}Her father was a legendary Inquisitor, but he broke the rules and was executed.{n}She was the one who interrogated and executed him.{n}Since that time, she has stopped growing, and both her body and mind remain eternally those of a young girl.{n}It is whispered that her heart also died at that moment, but she does not see it that way.{n}{n}Her primary weapons are the Conceptual Arms “Red Key” and “Blue Key”.{n}They take the form of a longsword and a shortsword.}"

Furthermore, the cookies he bakes are superb, and witches will often line up to demand them.{n}{n}Should possess enormous magical power, but as he always shows deference to his master, his power level is an unknown quantity.}"

stralias chars_8_2_rg4_1,":s;#FFFFFF`{p:3:Seven Sisters of Purgatory{n}Fourth Sister, Belphegor ({p:4:ベルフェゴール}){n}{n}Advanced‐level furniture created by {f:5:Beatrice}.{n}{n}Belphegor is taciturn, assiduous, and the most trusted of the sisters as furniture.{n}{n}However, that is partly because of her demonic desire to turn her masters into lazy pigs.{n}In that sense, she could probably be called the most demon‐like of all the sisters.{n}{n}Her flaw is that she is {i:too} serious.

For this reason, most arguments between the sisters are sparked and instigated by her.{n}{n}However, among the sisters, she is the most honest about her own emotions, and the most devoted to trying to please the opposite sex.{n}{n}Greedy but a hard worker, she will spare no effort to have a permanent monopoly on someone's affection.}"
